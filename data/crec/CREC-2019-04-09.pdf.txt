IN RECOGNITION OF DANA
STRICKLAND
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Dana
Strickland on 25 years with the Univer-
sity of Georgia, College of Pharmacy,
and to congratulate him for retiring on
March 29.
The College’s executive director of
external affairs, Mr. Strickland, has
been critical to the school’s success—
which is also my own alma mater—
over the past two decades.
Increasing the endowment by a con-
siderable amount, the College was able
to build new buildings, support re-
search by the faculty, and provide the
best possible education to its students
under Mr. Strickland’s leadership.
The importance of these improve-
ments cannot be overstated with the
changing nature of pharmacists today
who are on the front lines of the opioid
epidemic and the rising cost of pre-
scription drugs.
Thank you for your dedication to the
University of Georgia, the pharma-
ceutical profession, and congratula-
tions on your well-deserved retirement.
Mr. Strickland truly embodies what
it means to be a PharmDawg. Although
he will be difficult to replace, I have
the utmost confidence in Dr. Michael
Bartlett, who will be filling the role in
the meantime.
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM ‘‘RYAN’’
SAILORS
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of
William ‘‘Ryan’’ Sailors, who passed
away March 30 at the age of 22.
Throughout his life, Mr. Sailors had
a special gift to brighten the days of
everyone around him.
When he was younger, doctors
thought that his life expectancy would
only be to adolescence. Mr. Sailors not
only surpassed that milestone, but also
made the most of every single day he
was on this Earth.
He refused to let his special needs get
in his way, being infectiously positive
and becoming famous for his trade-
mark ‘‘thumbs up’’ to anyone passing
by.
Some of Mr. Sailors’ favorite activi-
ties included attending church each
week at Wesley Monumental, eating
snacks on the beach, and supervising
vacuuming and cleaning around the
house.
His life should be a reminder to all of
us that we should try to make this
world a happier place each and every
day.
Mr. Sailors’ family will be in my
thoughts and prayers during this dif-
ficult time.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHARLIE WALDROP
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Charlie
Waldrop on his 100th birthday, April 27,
2019. Throughout his life, Mr. Waldrop
has loved to serve others.
Serving our country during World
War II, he fought in both France and
Germany, and was discharged on his
wife’s birthday in 1946.
He served patients in Coastal Georgia
for over 40 years, working as a phar-
macist, and eventually opening his own
pharmacy.
His notoriety and success in the pro-
fession enabled him to become the
First District President of the Georgia
Pharmaceutical Association, but his
service doesn’t stop there. He also
worked as a deacon in his church and
leads a Boy Scout troop.
I am proud to call Mr. Waldrop a
Savannahian as he has become an icon
in our town since he first moved there
in 1927.
Mr. Waldrop, happy birthday, and
thank you for everything you did to in-
fluence my career.
Thank you for your service to our
Nation, to our community, and our
profession.
FORT STEWART-HUNTER ARMY AIRFIELD WINS
GOLD
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the Fort
Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield commu-
nity for being named the 2019 Army
Community of Excellence gold winner
this past March.
This year is a record seventh time
that these communities in the First
Congressional District of Georgia have

won the bronze.
I want to thank everyone at Fort
Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield for their
commitment to the readiness of the

of our military in the United States.

MARYLAND MOURNS THE PASSING
OF SPEAKER MICHAEL BUSCH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. HOYER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday
was the last day of the session of the
General Assembly in Maryland.
Sadly, the day before, on Sunday, the
longest serving speaker of the house of
delegates—as we call our house of rep-
resentatives—died on Sunday, and I
rise to pay tribute to him.
He was a great American, a great
public servant, and a very dear friend.
Maryland lost a champion. Michael
Busch, Speaker of the Maryland House
of Delegates, passed away after a long
and distinguished career serving the
people of our State.
He was young; he was 72 years of age,
and the longest serving speaker, as I
said, in the history of the house of del-
egates.
He had served as speaker of the house
since 2003, having first been elected to
represent Anne Arundel County in the
house of delegates in 1986.
His title was Mr. Speaker; many,
however, knew him as ‘‘Coach,’’ a re-
minder of his days as a teacher and
athletics coach at St. Mary’s High
School in Annapolis.
It was at St. Mary’s High School that
Michael Busch first made a name for
himself as a very excellent football
player. He later played at Temple Uni-
versity, and for 40 years, he worked
with the Anne Arundel County, Depart-
ment of Parks and Recreation with
young people, teaching them, men-
toring them, giving them values.
Many who served with him in the leg-
islature called him ‘‘Coach,’’ not just
because of his history, but because
Speaker Busch was like a coach and a
mentor to so many of those who served
in the house of delegates.
He was a man of deep intellect, poise,
steadiness under pressure, and a
wellspring of compassion.
He led efforts to expand access to
quality, affordable healthcare for
Marylanders. He helped lead efforts to
make Maryland one of the first States
to adopt marriage equality by legisla-
tive action, an action that was later
confirmed by the voters of our State.
He led the State in its effort to abol-
ish the death penalty, and he oversaw
the enactment of Maryland’s $15 min-
imum wage. And he worked hard to en-
sure a cleaner Chesapeake Bay and its
watershed for future generations while
increasing investments in renewable
energy.
Earlier this week, the General As-
sembly overrode the Governor’s veto to
enact Speaker Busch’s bill to protect
five oyster sanctuaries in the Bay.
Michael Busch’s positive impact on
Maryland will be felt for, literally, dec-
ades to come.
He was a good and decent person who
sought to elevate our politics during an
age when too many, unlike him, had
brought our politics low.
I hope my colleagues, Mr. Speaker,
would join me in expressing our condo-
lences to his wife, Cindy, their daugh-
ters, Erin and Megan, and to the entire
Busch family and to the people of
Maryland he served so faithfully for so
many years.
I hope all of us in this House will find
inspiration in Speaker Busch’s life and
legacy as we strive to do right by those
we serve, as he did for so many years,
and to do so together in a way that is
bipartisan, as was his inclination and
performance; and be reflective of the
way he lived his life and approached
the work of governing.
In an age where, as I said, politics
has been brought low by divisiveness,
and in some respects, hatefulness and
attacks on one another, Michael Busch
was somebody who treated others with
respect, with consideration, and with
fairness.
Michael Busch served Maryland well.
He served our people well. He will be
missed.

IN CELEBRATION OF NATIONAL
LIBRARY WEEK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration
of National Library Week, which began
on Sunday and runs through Saturday,
April 13.
This year’s theme is ‘‘Libraries =
Strong Communities,’’ and Melinda
Gates is the honorary chair.
In the last 20 years, the Gates Foun-
dation’s Global Libraries initiative has
been dedicated to enhancing libraries
and empowering local communities.
National Library Week is an annual
celebration highlighting the valuable
role libraries, librarians, and library
workers play in transforming lives and
strengthening our communities.
Mr. Speaker, libraries have always
been great equalizers in our society.
Nearly 1.3 billion people visit public li-
braries every year, according to the In-
stitute of Museum and Library Serv-
ices.
They are at the heart of our cities,
towns, schools and campuses, providing
critical resources, programs, and exper-
tise. Libraries provide a public space
where all community members—re-
gardless of age, culture, or income
level—can come together to connect
and learn.
First sponsored in 1958, National Li-
brary Week is an observance sponsored
by the American Library Association
and libraries across the country each
April.
It is a time to celebrate the contribu-
tions of our Nation’s libraries and li-
brarians and to promote library use
and support. All types of libraries, in-
cluding schools—public, academic, and
special—participate.
There are several celebrations
throughout the week, including today,
which is National Library Workers
Day. It is a time to show appreciation
for the staff, administrators, and
Friends groups, and recognize the valu-
able contributions made by all library
employees.
Tomorrow is National Bookmobile
Day, which is celebrated today to rec-
ognize contributions of our Nation’s
bookmobiles and dedicated profes-
sionals who make outreach possible
and books accessible in our rural com-
munities.
Mr. Speaker, from the largest library
in the world, the Library of Congress,
to the smallest local libraries around, I
hope Americans will support their local
libraries this week with a visit.
f
A PLEA NOT TO REINSTATE THE
FAMILY SEPARATION POLICY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise. And I rise because I
love my country. I rise today on a mis-
sion of mercy.
I am on a mission of mercy for people
that I will likely never meet and greet.
Perhaps by some fortuitous cir-
cumstance, I may encounter some of
them, but I know not who they are cur-
rently in the sense that I know them
personally.
I rise on behalf of the many people
who are seeking asylum, and I do so,
Mr. Speaker, because it has been re-
ported on many news stations—outlets,
if you will—that our President intends
to reinstate the family separation pol-
icy.
I rise on a mission of mercy, and I
make an appeal to the most powerful
man on the planet Earth. My appeal is
that you would not—N–O–T—you would
not reinstate this policy.
I beseech you to please, Mr. Presi-
dent, treat these people the way you
would want to be treated if you found
yourself in similar circumstances. I
beg that you would understand that
separating babies from mothers is un-
acceptable by any standard that we
know of.
No one supports the notion of taking
babies from their mothers, children
from their parents.
b 1015
So I am begging and pleading with
the President of the United States of
America, the most powerful man on
Earth: Please, Mr. President, do not re-
instate this policy.
I also appeal to my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to encourage the
President to do the right thing, the
just thing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3135
April 9, 2019
If we are not pleased with the laws in
this country, we have a means by
which we can address the law. If we be-
lieve that something is unacceptable,
there is a way for us to address it. The
way to address this problem is with im-
migration reform.
I beg the President and all my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle:
Please, let’s try to resolve this with
legislation. Let’s not do what we have
done and, quite frankly, have not
atoned for.
Some of the children are still not
back with their parents who were sepa-
rated previously. This is the United
States of America. This is not what we
do. We don’t take children from their
parents and then place them in places
where we cannot find them such that
we can reunite them.
This is my appeal, Mr. President. I
make the appeal because, as a Member
of Congress, I believe that at some
point we are going to have to account
for the actions that we engage in while
we are here. I don’t want it on my
record that while I was in the Congress
of the United States of America and I
had the opportunity to at least speak
to power, to speak truth to power, and
make an appeal on behalf of those who
are among the least, the last, and the
lost—I am making my appeal. I am
doing what I can to help those who are
fleeing harm’s way.
Mr. President, you don’t have to do
this, and I beg that Members of both
parties would please encourage him not
to do so.
This is a moment for us to reflect
and a moment for us to demonstrate to
the world that what we preach, we will
practice. We have, for years, encour-
aged other countries to take in refu-
gees. We have gone so far as to pay
countries to take in refugees. We have
funded countries to take in refugees.
We ought to practice what we preach.
Those who are not qualified should
not come, should not be brought into
our country. But I would also say this,
that we should not say to the world: Go
back, refugees, asylum seekers. You
are not welcome in the United States
of America.
This is not the country that would
proclaim such a thing. Our laws we
stand on, and I stand on those laws.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
MUCAAD HUSSEIN ABDALLA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to remember the life of Mucaad
Hussein Abdalla, known by his friends
and family as Siraaj.
Last month, a tragic incident took
the lives of 157 individuals when an air-
plane crashed in Ethiopia. This unfor-
tunate event took the lives of eight
Americans, and one of those individ-
uals was Mucaad Hussein Abdalla.
Mucaad was a member of our commu-
nity. Growing up in St. Cloud, Min-
nesota, he graduated from St. Cloud
Apollo High School and began a career
as a truck driver.
To his friends and family, Mucaad
was simply known by his nickname,
Siraaj, meaning a light or a lamp. He
brought laughter, joy, and light to
those around him.
We extend our most sincere condo-
lences to his family and loved ones for
their loss.
THANKING KORIANN CARTER AND THE UNITED
WAY OF CENTRAL MINNESOTA
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize community resource
navigator KoriAnn Carter and the
United Way of Central Minnesota for
working together on a pilot program to
assist students and families at Lincoln
Elementary School with food, housing
assistance, mentoring, and after-school
programs.
In addition, I want to recognize the
work KoriAnn does through a program
called Girls On Arise To Succeed in
partnership with the Roosevelt Boys &
Girls Club, McKinley Area Learning
Center, and CentraCare Health, which
brings young girls together to discuss
important life topics and provide guid-
ance.
For young women encountering fam-
ily issues, experiencing homelessness,
or struggling with mental health
issues, this group gives them a space to
talk to adults who care. Girls between
12 and 18 can participate in one of the
girls groups where they learn lessons in
healthy habits, the importance of edu-
cation, how your current actions im-
pact your future choices, leadership
skills, goal setting, and gratitude.
These groups have transformed stu-
dents throughout the St. Cloud area,
giving them an avenue to succeed as
well as find community and fellowship.
I thank KoriAnn and all the partners
who make this possible. Their work to
foster the next generation of leaders
makes our corner of the world a better
place.
CONGRATULATING ST. CLOUD VA
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate the St. Cloud VA
for being one of only 18 hospitals na-
tionwide to be selected to participate
in the Department of Veterans Affairs’
efforts to establish the highest level of
care for our military veterans.
Our veterans and our community
rely on the St. Cloud VA to provide the
highest level of care possible already.
So to those of us in the community, it
comes as no surprise that our VA will
now help lead the Nation and the VA
system to help establish these stand-
ards.
The selection is a great honor and
testament to everyone who makes the
St. Cloud VA the success it is today.
The opportunity to lead our VA system
to the highest standard of care for our
Nation’s heroes is indeed a high call-
ing.
Congratulations to the St. Cloud VA,
and good luck in your mission.
RECOGNIZING STEVENS INSTITUTE
OF TECHNOLOGY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of a university in my
district that has demonstrated leader-
ship and innovation in STEM edu-
cation.
Stevens Institute of Technology, lo-
cated in Hoboken, New Jersey, has
been leading the way with a rigorous
technical curriculum that attracts the
attention of some of the Nation’s most
sought-after companies and industries.
The university continues to develop
new ways in which to augment the suc-
cess of their students, and I was
pleased to hear recently about inven-
tive initiatives that support the suc-
cess of underserved and underrep-
resented students.
It is telling that the applications
have increased 191 percent, and under-
graduate enrollment has seen a 41 per-
cent growth. Moreover, the graduation
rate has impressively risen to 87 per-
cent with Pell grant recipients grad-
uating at a rate of 91 percent. This is
well above the national averages,
which are 59 percent and 51 percent, re-
spectively.
There is a reason. Forbes magazine
recently called Stevens ‘‘one of the
most desirable STEM colleges in the
Nation.’’
Upon graduation, 96 percent of Ste-
vens graduates either get a job in their
field, with an average starting salary
of over $70,000, or enter graduate school
within 6 months.
Not only is Stevens producing stu-
dents who are highly skilled and pre-
pared for the professional world, but
Stevens is also at the forefront of cut-
ting-edge research in areas of national
importance, such as artificial intel-
ligence and quantum computing. In a
recent National Science Foundation
competition for quantum engineering,
Stevens won two out of eight grants
awarded.
There are over 40,000 Stevens alumni
who are essential to the economic
progress of New Jersey and the Nation.
I am proud to represent the university
that acts as a trailblazer in scientific
innovation.
I would like to recognize President
Farvardin for his leadership, and I look
forward to the continued success of
Stevens and its students.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GERALD
ALEXANDER KNIGHT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize a great American,
Gerald Alexander Knight, who was
born on April 11, 1944. He was the mid-
dle child of five children born to his
parents, Woodrow and Virda Knight.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3136 April 9, 2019
His family, like most American fami-
lies, had much to overcome during the
ending of World War II and the eco-
nomic and emotional hardship that en-
sued during the postwar period.
While the Knight family struggled to
make ends meet, the American values
of hard work, pride in what you do, and
determination were instilled at a very
young age. Gerald began working at
the early age of 6 when he routinely
walked a half mile to gather 3 gallons
of water from his grandparents’ home.
When he turned 14, he earned his
driver’s license and began driving a
pulpwood truck at 4:30 every morning
to earn money for his family. After fin-
ishing his early morning drive to the
lumberyard, he would attend school
and then returned home to gather an-
other load of wood.
Gerald would often say: ‘‘I was born
into poverty, but I did not choose to
stay in poverty.’’
After graduating from Flat Creek
High School in 1962, he joined the Air
Force and boarded a bus to San Anto-
nio, Texas, where he entered training
to become an air traffic controller. He
was one of only three out of 18 to grad-
uate, and he became an air traffic con-
troller as part of the 648th SAGE
Squadron serving during the Cuban
Missile Crisis, where he monitored air
traffic in the Southeastern United
States and Puerto Rico to Cuba.
Gerald was soon stationed in Ger-
many. During a visit to his home, he
met his future wife, Joyce, on a blind
date set up by his brother Charles.
After one date, he asked her to marry
him. However, being a senior in high
school and needing to graduate, Joyce
declined but promised to wait for Ger-
ald until his military service was com-
pleted.
Gerald spent the next 2.5 years in
Birkenfeld, Germany, where he contin-
ued to work in air traffic control and
warning systems, monitoring the air-
space of Europe, including tracking
and identifying all aircraft in the air-
space.
After completing his service in the
Air Force, Gerald hitchhiked home,
where the Vietnam war was raging. His
younger brother Ronnie had been draft-
ed and sent to serve in Vietnam. Ger-
ald, wanting to be with his brother, of-
fered to reenlist in the Air Force, pro-
vided he went to Vietnam. He never
served in Vietnam due to a clerical
error by the Air Force and was, in-
stead, sent to Maine, where he declined
and returned to South Carolina.
He married Joyce on November 6,
1966, and by 1970, they were the proud
parents of two small girls, Carrie and
Bobbie.
After working in the textile industry
for a short time, he was hired by the
DuPont company located in Camden,
South Carolina, where he initially
worked as a spinner operator. The com-
pany quickly realized that Gerald had
a unique talent for listening and relat-
ing to people and moved him into the
employee assistance department,
where he was certified and began inves-
tigating sexual harassment cases and
representing DuPont in Federal court.
He counseled employees and their
families dealing with addiction prob-
lems, as well as working for the Lan-
caster Recovery Center, which served
the entire community on these issues.
Gerald was uniquely qualified to deal
with these issues as he had struggled
with alcohol abuse in his younger years
until surrendering his life to Christ at
the age of 38.
Gerald was instrumental in writing
new human resources policy for Du-
Pont and was once told: ‘‘You are the
best outhouse lawyer I have ever seen.’’
His career at DuPont was stellar, and
he was characterized by his peers as
being honest, caring, and treating ev-
eryone with respect and dignity, re-
gardless of their status in life.
When Gerald was asked what his
greatest accomplishment was in life,
his response was: ‘‘My girls. I look at
their lives to measure my success, as
they are well-adjusted human beings
with their own families serving God.’’
Gerald Alexander Knight has lived a
life with a sense of moral obligation to
duty and a personal creed of God, fam-
ily, and country, in that order.
He is a proud member of the Greatest
Generation and will be remembered for
his kindness, generosity, and integrity.
God bless you, Gerald Alexander
Knight. The world was a better place
because you were in it.

RECOGNIZING PETTY OFFICER
SECOND CLASS MARGARET
NICOL OF THE U.S. COAST
GUARD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to take a moment to recognize
Petty Officer Second Class Margaret
Nicol of the United States Coast
Guard.
A fellow resident of Sammamish,
Washington, Maggie grew up in a large
boating community in Florida. She
found out all too well at the early age
of 8 that the Coast Guard is an elite
group of individuals whom we can al-
ways count on when she had to be res-
cued by them. Driven by a desire to
give back, she enlisted in the Coast
Guard Reserves during high school.
After attending college, she com-
pleted 2 years of Active-Duty service in
Iraq, responded to Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita, and went on to pursue reg-
istered nursing.
After relocating to the Seattle area
in 2017, she rapidly qualified well ahead
of deadlines to earn her response boat-
small coxswain and boarding team
member qualifications. To support her
colleagues, she amassed over 130 hours
helping to train and qualify crew mem-
bers, significantly increasing Station
Seattle’s Reserve mobilization readi-
ness.
But Petty Officer Nicol’s commit-
ment to our country does not stop at
the armed services. She is a business
owner of FLWA Holdings, providing af-
fordable housing for those in need in
Washington and Florida. She volun-
teers at Food Lifeline, serves local
schools in the community, and engages
with the Diveheart Foundation for dis-
abled children, adults, and veterans.
Among her accolades, Petty Officer
Nicol has earned the Global War on
Terror Service Medal, the Humani-
tarian Service Medal, and, most re-
cently, the high honor of being named
the 2018 Coast Guard Enlisted Person of
the Year. She epitomizes the Coast
Guard’s core values of honor, respect,
and devotion to duty. Most impor-
tantly, she leads by example, cham-
pions a humanitarian spirit, and has
devoted her life to serving others.
Thank you, Maggie. Washington
State and the Coast Guard would not
be the same without you.
TAHOMA HIGH SCHOOL, STATE CHAMPIONS
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Tahoma High
School, State champions.
Congratulations to the students of
Tahoma High School from Washington
State’s Maple Valley on their 10th con-
secutive statewide victory and 23rd vic-
tory in the last 25 years in the Center
for Civic Education’s We the People:

CONGRATULATING KAY ARTHUR
ON RECEIVING THE LYDIA IM-
PACT AWARD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker,
few people have the gift to bring people
together, but Kay Arthur is one of
these special individuals. Her passion
for people and deeply rooted faith is il-
luminated through her television,
radio, and online programs in which
she uses God’s Word to reach over 75
million households in over 30 countries.
Kay is a four-time ECPA Christian
Book Award-winning author and the
cofounder of Precept Ministries Inter-
national, and she will soon be recog-
nized once again as the recipient of the
Scenic City Women’s Network Lydia
Impact Award.
An institution in the Chattanooga
community, the vision of the Scenic
City Women’s Network is to encourage,
equip, and energize Christian women.
As part of this vision, the Lydia Award
is a special honor for a woman who
emulates the attributes of Lydia in the
Bible: a devout woman, a seeking
woman, a hospitable woman, and one
who is fervent in spirit and serves the
Lord.
Mr. Speaker, that woman is Kay Ar-
thur.
I would like to share a story that il-
lustrates her servant heart:
Being a high-profile Bible teacher
and author has never kept Kay from
striving to meet the needs of whoever
crosses her path. From waiters to cab
drivers, Kay Arthur seeks to truly
meet people where they are, but never
leave them without a pathway to hope.
One chilly afternoon, Kay and her
son David were driving back to the of-
fice after a lunch appointment. Kay no-
ticed a lady in a wheelchair on the side
of the road. David was instructed to
promptly pull over. Kay sprang out of
the car and approached the woman.
After a quick conversation, Kay took
off her full-length winter coat, wrapped
it around this lady and shared that
Jesus loves her, and the coat is a sign
of His gracious love to her.
Kay never meets a stranger, no mat-
ter if in Chattanooga or a country
across the world. She loves people, and
she loves her Lord Jesus. She consist-
ently seeks to demonstrate her love
with kind words and actions. She truly
has the servant heart of our Savior,
Jesus Christ.
Mr. Speaker, as you have just heard,
Kay, like Lydia, has committed her life
to her faith and exemplifies what it is
to be a woman of God.
I would like to congratulate Kay Ar-
thur on receiving the prestigious Lydia
Impact Award and thank her for her
blessing our Nation with her Christian
heart and service.
f
SOCIALISM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Connecticut (Mr. HIMES) for 5 minutes.
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise this
morning to talk about a word that is
everywhere, a word that is the response
to every idea that we come up with,
and that word is ‘‘socialism.’’
It is a scary word. It is a magical
word. It is the word that comes up
every time Democrats propose a plan
to better educate America’s children—
socialism; to make the elderly more se-
cure in their retirement—socialism; to
make healthcare available to people in
this country who still can’t see a doc-
tor—socialism.
It is a magical word because, if you
say ‘‘socialism,’’ then it allows you to
hide the fact that you actually don’t
have a counterplan, that when the
Democrats say here are a bunch of
plans to make healthcare better and
you don’t have a plan, you just say ‘‘so-
cialism,’’ and that could end the con-
versation.
It is a magical word because it allows
you to distract from the fact that, if
you actually do the things to better
educate America’s children or to make
America’s retirees more secure in their
retirement or to make healthcare more
available, that costs a little money.
The problem with that is that, for my
Republican colleagues, that money
needs to go into tax cuts for the
wealthiest people in this country and
for corporations. That is a problem.
By the way, it is not a new thing.
This has been going on for 100 years. I
have a quote here from President
Reagan. He is talking about Medicare
here:
And behind it will come other Federal pro-
grams that will invade every area of freedom
as we know it in this country until, one day,
we will awake to find that we have social-
ism.
Ronald Reagan promised us that
Medicare, probably one of the most
successful programs this country has
ever put forward, would lead to social-
ism. It goes back before that.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who did
so much to make for the decency that
is endemic in this country after the De-
pression, the Securities and Exchange
Commission so that our capitalist
economy would be a fair economy, the
progressive income tax so we could ac-
tually fund our military and fund edu-
cation—all socialism. He was a traitor
to his class. He was a socialist. This
goes way back.
So having quoted Ronald Reagan, let
me quote another great leader, Inigo
Montoya, in ‘‘The Princess Bride.’’ He
says: ‘‘You keep using that word. I do
not think it means what you think it
means.’’
So what does socialism mean? What
is socialism?
Here is the dictionary definition. It is
a system in which there is no private
property or a system in which the gov-
ernment owns the means of production.
What is that? Is Medicare socialist?
At Mount Sinai or Sloan Kettering, are
those hospitals or doctors working for
the government? Of course not.
Was Dodd-Frank socialist? No. Dodd-
Frank put in place regulations that
have allowed JPMorgan Chase,
Citibank, Wells Fargo, and all those
banks to be more profitable than ever
before. That is not socialism.
What is particularly interesting is
socialism is just a lot of government in
your economy. I took time to look at
States where government is actually a
big part of the economy. You can look
this up, Mr. Speaker.
There is an article called, ‘‘The Top
Five Most Socialist States.’’ West Vir-
ginia, Alaska, Wyoming, Mississippi,
and Arkansas are the five States with
the largest percentage of government
spending as part of their economy—
deep, deep red States. The top five so-
cialist States, Republican.
Now, what about those socialist
States that my Republican friends call
socialist? Here are a couple of them:
California, New York, Massachusetts—
that is Taxachusettes.
California: My friend, DEVIN NUNES,
the Representative from California, be-
cause they are trying to take plastic
out of the Pacific Ocean, called Cali-
fornia socialist.
These are the economic powerhouses
of the Nation. They have GDPs that
look like small countries. They have
innovators; they start companies. And
the reason for that is because
innovators and business people want to
start businesses in communities where
there are good schools, access to
healthcare, and people have the wages
to actually buy their products.
So, Mr. Speaker, don’t be fooled by
that magical word, ‘‘socialism.’’ So-
cialism is what is used to address every
effort that we make to make for a
more fair and just society. That is not
socialism.
These things—increased wages, bet-
ter healthcare, and better access to
education—are not socialism. They are
in the finest tradition of making sure
that opportunity is available to every
American and that the American
Dream will not die.
f
CONSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BYRNE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to raise questions of grave con-
stitutional significance.
Last week, the chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee re-
quested the IRS turn over years’ worth
of President Trump’s personal and
business tax returns. These are returns
that cover business decisions and deal-
ings long before the President came to
office.

HOUSE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3138 April 9, 2019
Similarly, the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform has in-
dicated that his committee will exam-
ine allegations regarding how the
President valued real estate, among
other business decisions, long before
the President was elected. He has also
indicated he may call members of the
President’s family to testify about
these and other Trump Organization
dealings.
These actions are not only blatantly
partisan, but they raise serious con-
stitutional concerns.
Our system is one of limited powers
and of checks and balances. The Con-
gress is not a law enforcement agency.
It is not a court of law. It is a legisla-
tive body.
Beside me are the words of Chief Jus-
tice Earl Warren, someone whom I
would say most on the other side hold
in high esteem:
‘‘There is no general authority to ex-
pose the private affairs of individuals
without justification in terms of the
functions of the Congress. . . . Inves-
tigations conducted solely for the per-
sonal aggrandizement of the investiga-
tors or to ‘punish’ those investigated
are indefensible.’’
As the Supreme Court has repeatedly
affirmed, investigations conducted by
this House ‘‘must be related to and be
in furtherance of a legitimate task of
the Congress.’’
The Court has particularly warned
that investigations of the private af-
fairs of individuals are off limits with-
out a clear connection to this body’s
constitutional functions. Rightly so.
We are a nation of laws and of liberty.
The President’s political opponents
tried and failed to make his tax returns
and his business dealings an issue in
the 2016 Presidential election. The
American people settled that issue at
the ballot box.
b 1045
It is absolutely clear that the major-
ity does not seek the President’s tax
returns, information about his busi-
ness, or to haul his family before Con-
gress in an effort to pass new laws or
for some other legislative purpose.
These investigations are thinly
veiled attempts to use the powers of
this Chamber to provide ammunition
for the 2020 election.
Mr. Speaker, each of us swears a duty
to uphold the Constitution. Each of us
has a responsibility to ensure that our
actions conform within its boundaries
and its principles. I urge the majority
to remember that obligation and recon-
sider this course.
The investigatory power of this insti-
tution is absolutely critical to our
function as a coequal and independent
branch of government.
Excesses by the body led to an inter-
vention by the Supreme Court in an
over 40-year period when the right of
Congress to compel testimony was
called into question.
Again, in the 1950s, the court was
forced to intervene to stop the excesses
of the House Un-American Activities
Committee.
Let’s be clear. These so-called inves-
tigations set a dangerous precedent.
The majority wants to use Congress to
investigate the past personal and busi-
ness dealings of an elected official and
his family. This is yet another attempt
to coerce and intimidate people with
whom they disagree.
This isn’t legitimate. This is a witch
hunt, and it threatens to undermine
legislative investigations in the future.
So, again, I ask the majority to
think very hard about their constitu-
tional obligations and what these par-
tisan attacks against the President
will mean for the future of this House.
It is your right to oppose the President
at the ballot box, not to use the powers
of this body to score political points.
There is no legitimate purpose for
this Congress to investigate the Presi-
dent or his family before he was elect-
ed to office.
f
RECOGNIZING VICTORIA MEJIAS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Victoria Mejias, a
leader from my district in Omaha, Ne-
braska, who has overcome the physical
impairments of multiple sclerosis, or
MS, to help those in desperate need,
those who need to find new homes, new
jobs, and new schools in the wake of
Hurricanes Maria, Sandy, and Katrina
and the tornados that rampaged Pilger,
Nebraska, and Joplin, Missouri.
Victoria has been involved in mis-
sionary work for many years and has
always had an active interest in serv-
ing others in need. She found her sec-
ond calling by assisting disaster relief
efforts and facilitating the relocation
of those most affected.
In 2017, Victoria found her work hit-
ting closer to home than ever before.
Victoria, who is the daughter of a
Puerto Rican family, assisted in the re-
lief efforts for Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands when they were dev-
astated by the powerful category 4 hur-
ricane which claimed an estimated
3,057 human lives and caused $91 billion
worth of damage.
She worked fervently alongside U.S.
veteran Joel Ortiz to initiate a relief
project that would help relocate af-
fected families to Omaha and the sur-
rounding areas. With her efforts, dis-
placed families would have a place to
call their home away from home.
The result was the birth of an organi-
zation which Victoria is proud to call
her own, Heartland United for Puerto
Rico. This organization has assisted
approximately 50 families in relocating
to areas throughout Nebraska and Iowa
and continues to make influential im-
pacts in the lives of these individuals
who lost nearly everything.
Unfortunately, much of Victoria’s ef-
forts have been slowed as she continues
her fight against the horrible impacts
of MS. MS can be treated through dis-
ease-modifying therapies which work
to reduce the frequency and severity of
relapses, but they do not cure MS. In
fact, there is no known cure.
Multiple sclerosis attacks the im-
mune system’s healthy cells and af-
fects the ability of the central nervous
system to control the activities of the
body.
In 2006, Victoria encountered her
first difficulty with this disease when
she lost her balance and fell to the
ground, having no feeling of support
from her legs beneath her. She was for-
mally diagnosed with MS in 2016.
The diagnosis, although challenging,
gave her a sense of relief, as she finally
knew her experience was real and valid.
She continues to suffer from many
effects of the disease, such as broken
legs and color blindness, and is no
longer physically able to have the same
influence she once had, but Victoria
has the motivation to be a trans-
formative leader within her commu-
nity and does not let this stop her.
When you meet Victoria, she will tell
you that being self-aware of your chal-
lenges is a strength, not a weakness.
What Victoria has accomplished in
the lives of others is an achievement
difficult for many who do not suffer
from any physical limitations. There-
fore, we should all draw inspiration
from her example, her determination,
and her achievements, all while strug-
gling with the debilitating effects of
MS.
May we all strive to be leaders in our
communities, as Victoria has and will
continue to be.
Victoria, we salute you and pray for
your strength. We pray for your heal-
ing from this burdensome disease.
Thank you for being such a great ex-
ample and inspiration to all of us.

HONORING THE NATIONAL
ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS
(Mrs. KIRKPATRICK asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the National
Alliance on Mental Illness and to show
support for my community and the
millions of Americans living with a
mental illness.
This weekend, I marched in the
NAMI Walk to help raise awareness. I
was inspired to hear the brave stories
of so many survivors who have not
given up on their mental wellness.
Before the Affordable Care Act was
enacted, mental health coverage was
lacking or missing altogether from
most health plans. Medicaid expansion,
a cornerstone of the ACA, has dramati-
cally expanded access to treatment in
many States, including Arizona.
But the Trump administration is
again trying to eliminate the ACA and
remove protections for people with
mental illness and preexisting condi-
tions.
Republicans have no health plan
other than fighting to take away
America’s healthcare. We must raise
our voices and reject this again. We
must fight for our healthcare and the
coverage that treats our most vulner-
able communities.
f
DON’T LET GOVERNMENT TAKE
OVER THE INTERNET
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to shed some light on the total
hypocrisy of the Democrats’ Save the
Internet Act under the guise of net
neutrality.
This bill is nothing short of a Federal
Government takeover of the internet,
and the end result would be cata-
strophic. Democrats want a panel of
unelected bureaucrats to have nearly
limitless control over the internet, in-
cluding decisions over content modera-
tion and imposing new taxes and fees
for internet services by the FCC.
To be clear, they would like the Fed-
eral Government to have nearly un-
checked authority to regulate your
internet. That should terrify those of
you sitting at home.
This goes against everything that
made the internet such a trans-
formative engine of the American
economy in the first place. In fact, this
type of regulatory approach would
cripple smaller ISPs that can’t afford
the burdensome regulations, especially
in rural communities.
I believe in a free and open internet
that fosters innovation and takes our
economy to new heights, like we have
reached already. This legislation will
do the opposite of that.
This isn’t ‘‘Save the Internet.’’ We
must vote ‘‘no’’ to save the internet
process and the freedom to access it
from legislation like this.
f
IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTHCARE
FOR ALL AMERICANS
(Ms. JOHNSON of Texas asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
my experience as the first registered
nurse elected to Congress allows me to
examine our Nation’s healthcare prior-
ities with firsthand knowledge.
Currently, our mental health system
is failing our communities. Our Fed-
eral Government spends billions each
year without addressing the underlying
causes of mental health illnesses.
Needless to say, reform is necessary.
In Congress, we have defended protec-
tions for preexisting conditions in the
Affordable Care Act, a law that has
brought a sense of security for the 11.5
million Texans and 133 million Ameri-
cans living with preexisting conditions.
As we continue our work, we cannot
lose sight of those living with mental
health illnesses as preexisting condi-
tions.
There is much to be achieved, and I
am eager to continue working for the
people to improve mental healthcare
for every American.
f
RELEASING JAMES BAKER’S
INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS
(Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I have released several transcripts
of interviews from the Judiciary Com-
mittee’s investigation into the appar-
ent wrongdoing at the FBI and the Jus-
tice Department. Today, I am releasing
another.
The American people deserve trans-
parency. They deserve to know what
transpired at the highest levels of the
FBI and at the origin of the probe into
President Trump’s campaign.
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I request
that the link
www.dougcollins.house.gov/baker be
placed in the RECORD so the American
people can review the transcript of one
of James Baker’s interviews.
Out of an abundance of caution, this
transcript has a limited number of nar-
rowly tailored redactions, relating only
to confidential sources and methods,
nonpublic information about ongoing
investigations, and nonmaterial per-
sonal information.
I will continue to work to release as
many transcripts as possible, including
the entirety of Mr. Baker’s interviews
with the Judiciary Committee.
The American people deserve the
truth.
f
SECRET HEALTHCARE PLAN
(Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks
ago, the Trump Justice Department
filed in court to say that the entire Af-
fordable Care Act should be voided.
The President said: Don’t worry. We
are going to have a great and better
plan to replace it.
Then MITCH MCCONNELL said: No, no,
we are not doing that.
Then Trump said: Well, we will run
on healthcare in 2020 and promise a
better plan.
And his consultant said: No, better
not do that.
So now he has a secret plan that will
be unveiled after the next election to
replace the Affordable Care Act. Twen-
ty-one million Americans would lose
their insurance if it went away tomor-
row.
We had another guy running for
President back in 1968, Richard
Milhous Nixon. He had a secret plan to
end the Vietnam war. Actually, he
didn’t have a plan to end the war, but
it helped him win the Presidency.
Shame on us if a fake promise to
have a better healthcare plan undis-
closed will come out after the election.

RECOGNIZING ARISTON CAFE
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois
asked and was given permission to ad-

Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise to recognize one of the
most well-known landmarks along
Route 66 in Illinois, the Ariston Cafe,
on its 95th year of operation.
After opening in 1924 along Route 4 in
Carlinville, the Ariston actually pre-
dates Route 66. In 1935, it moved to its
current location along the Mother
Road in Litchfield, Illinois.
The Ariston Cafe is a member of the
Route 66 Association Hall of Fame and
Museum and is in the National Reg-
ister of Historic Places in Illinois and
the National Park Service.
The Ariston is one of the oldest res-
taurants along Route 66 and is the
fifth-longest running restaurant in the
entire State of Illinois.
Later this spring, the Ariston will be
holding a relighting ceremony to cele-
brate the replacement of its classic
neon sign, thanks to a grant from the
National Park Service.
The Ariston Cafe is a treasure within
central Illinois and along Route 66, and
I look forward to many more years of
success for this great restaurant.

BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF
HISTORY
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, basic
healthcare coverage for 23 million ev-
eryday Americans and thousands of
people in my district of the Virgin Is-
lands is at risk of being undermined be-
cause our friends across the aisle fail
to have the same urgency about these
impending calamities.
Virgin Islanders are at a critical
junction. We face a daunting and dev-
astating Medicaid cliff on September
30, 2019, an absolute collapse in Med-
icaid.
Our Republican colleagues continue
the work to dismantle healthcare for
millions of Americans right now. They
voted to eliminate protection for pre-
existing conditions and to strip their
healthcare coverage.
Last weekend, the Trump adminis-
tration escalated its attack on Ameri-
cans’ healthcare by supporting a Fed-
eral judge’s ruling that the entire Af-
fordable Care Act should be thrown
out.
Today, I ask my Republican col-
leagues: What side will history find you
on, protecting American families or
the need to protect partisan interests?
A demonstration of this was the Re-
publican-controlled Senate’s failure
last week to advance a disaster aid
package that includes billions for
American families still recovering
from 2017 natural disasters.
Be on the right side of history.

FIX OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
(Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was

Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I

United States.
I will work with anyone, regardless
of political party, who has ideas to im-
prove healthcare and get costs down,

partment of Justice wants to gut the
Affordable Care Act with no plan.
We need to stabilize the volatile
healthcare marketplace, increase com-
petition so that affordable prescription
drugs are within reach for everyone,
cover preexisting conditions, and make
sure that we always protect the Social
Security and Medicare that our seniors
rely on.
Last Congress, the bipartisan Prob-
lem Solvers Caucus introduced such a
proposal, and we need to get it done
now.
In New Jersey, we are very lucky to
have some of the best healthcare pro-
viders, innovators, and hospitals in the
world. We are America’s medicine cabi-
net.
Our people deserve a bipartisan ap-
proach to fix our healthcare system so
that we can look out for everyone in
New Jersey and everyone across the
country.

WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE
OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, when we
took our oath in January, no issue be-
fore us was more critical than
healthcare.
Over the past 100 days, we have
fought the administration’s efforts to
gut the Affordable Care Act at every
turn. We must keep at it because the
ACA has allowed 53,000 New Hampshire
residents to enroll in Medicaid expan-
sion. The coverage for substance use
disorder makes it the best tool we have
to fight the opioid crisis.
We also voted to empower House
counsel to defend coverage for those
with preexisting conditions. Half the
adult population in my State of New
Hampshire has a preexisting condition.
We can’t go back to the days when in-
surance companies could discriminate
against them.
We have also introduced legislation
that will lower premiums, strengthen
patient protections, and crack down on
junk plans that could send New Hamp-
shire families right into bankruptcy.
Lowering costs and expanding access
to care must continue to be at the top
of our priority list. Nothing is more
important to the health of our districts
and the well-being of this Nation.
Let’s work together to improve our
healthcare system, not play politics
with it.

HEALTHCARE AND THE BUDGET
(Mr. WOODALL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, you
have heard in the last round of 60-sec-
ond comments a sense of urgency
around healthcare. I share that sense
of urgency, as I know everybody on my
side of the aisle does.
But for the next 1 hour, Mr. Speaker,
we are going to be talking about what
purports to be the House budget, the
budget that would tell us what our
Medicaid priorities are, the budget that
would tell us how we are going to save
Medicare, the budget that would tell us
how we are going to protect Social Se-
curity, and the budget that would tell
us what our values are as a nation.
That is what the law requires: that we
bring such a document to the floor and
that we do it by April 15.
But for the next hour, Mr. Speaker,
what you are going to hear is that the
House is producing no such budget,
that the House is silent on protecting
Medicaid, silent on protecting Medi-
care, and silent on protecting Social
Security.
We can do better, as my colleagues
have challenged us to do. It is going to
take a partnership, though, not empty
accusations.

CLIMATE CHANGE
(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to call for urgent
action to reduce carbon pollution and
save our planet.
We know climate change poses seri-
ous environmental and economic
threats to communities across New
Hampshire and throughout the United
States. Let me give you one unusual
example:
In New Hampshire and Maine, re-
searchers have found a 70 percent mor-
tality rate among young moose calves
between 2014 and 2016. That is up from
15 percent just two decades ago. These
deaths are caused by the prevalence of
winter ticks that are thriving with
warmer winters.
Another recent study found that
warming rivers could have an impact
on the health of brook trout.

Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
be given 5 legislative days to revise and
extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, on
Monday, the Rules Committee met and
reported a rule, House Resolution 294,
providing for consideration of H.R.
2021, the Investing for the People Act,
under a structured rule. The rule pro-
vides 1 hour of debate equally divided
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing member of the Committee on the
Budget. The rule makes in order three
amendments, each debatable for 10
minutes.
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 1644, the Save the Inter-
net Act. The rule provides 1 hour of de-
bate equally divided and controlled by
the chair and ranking member of the
Committee on Energy and Commerce.
The rule makes in order 12 amend-
ments, each debatable for 10 minutes.
Additionally, the rule deems as
passed House Resolution 293, which will
immediately put in place an enforce-
able top-line discretionary spending
level so that the Appropriations Com-
mittee can begin its work.
Finally, the rule provides standard
recess instructions through April 26.
Mr. Speaker, the Investing for the
People Act is a 2-year budget bill that
will raise the defense sequestration
caps for defense and nondefense discre-
tionary spending for fiscal year 2020
and 2021.
I believe my colleagues from both
sides of the aisle fully understand the
devastating effects of sequestration.
Across-the-board, mandatory cuts to
every Federal program are not a suc-
cessful path to fiscal responsibility.
Without taking action to lift the
caps established by the Budget Control
Act, nondefense discretionary funding
will be cut by $54 billion. Such drastic
cuts threaten public health, the envi-
ronment, access to education, job
training, and lifesaving social services
like food and housing assistance.
Cuts to nondefense discretionary
funding would also impact our national
security. Nearly one-third of invest-
ments in this area fund veterans’ pro-
grams, homeland security initiatives,
diplomatic operations, foreign aid, and
Justice Department activities.
If an agreement on lifting the cap is
not reached, defense programs also
stand to lose $71 billion. In a dangerous
world, those cuts would be, in my view,
harmful to national and global secu-
rity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3142 April 9, 2019
Only a few months ago, the American
people felt the harsh effects of a gov-
ernment shutdown. It is time to come
together to take decisive action to
avoid another blow to essential Federal
programs that help hardworking Amer-
icans in every State. This legislation
ensures working families will be able
to rely on continued Federal funding
for the programs that keep them safe,
support their jobs, and invest in their
children.
In fiscal year 2020, defense spending
would be capped at $664 billion, with
nondefense discretionary spending
capped at $631 billion.
The Investing for the People Act
would also provide up to $8 billion, an-
nually, for nondefense overseas contin-
gency operations, OCO, activities that
do not count against the spending caps,
while limiting OCO designation of de-
fense spending in 2020 and 2021 to no
more than the fiscal year 2019 level of
$69 billion dollars.
In his budget, President Trump pro-
posed continued spending on defense
measures but massive cuts to domestic
programs like public health research,
infrastructure investment, and support
for low-income families.
Even as our Nation draws down from
our overseas war operations, domestic
spending remains at a historic low as a
percentage of our economy. H.R. 2021
provides a pathway for improving the
lives of Americans in every community
and renews our commitment to spend-
ing to meet the needs of our commu-
nities and invest in our economy.
In addition to protecting Americans
from spending cuts, the House will be
considering protections for a product
all of us here today rely upon to do our
jobs and live our lives, just like mil-
lions of Americans: the internet. This
rule also provides for consideration of
essential protections for American con-
sumers who use the internet.
The Save the Internet Act would re-
instate the Open Internet Order of 2015
that classifies broadband internet serv-
ices as common carriers that are pro-
hibited from preferentially treating or
discriminating against groups of per-
sons.
An overwhelming 86 percent of Amer-
icans opposed the FCC’s rollback of net
neutrality protections. All this legisla-
tion does, Mr. Speaker, is restore those
protections.
Fair and reliable internet access is
absolutely essential to millions of
working families and small business
owners. Practices like blocking, throt-
tling, and paid prioritization harm the
ability of every American to experi-
ence the internet in the same way, re-
gardless of provider or how much
money you pay.
The Save the Internet Act includes
enhanced transparency protections and
enacts specific rules against throttling,
blocking, and other violations of net
neutrality. The FCC would be empow-
ered to investigate consumer and busi-
ness complaints and impose necessary
fines against internet service providers
for violations of the Communications
Act.
The bill also provides pathways to
internet access for every American, es-
pecially those in rural communities
who are being left behind by modern,
high-speed internet infrastructure.
The Save the Internet Act would
once again allow the FCC to fund rural
broadband through the Connect Amer-
ica Fund.
Additionally, this legislation revives
the Lifeline program, created under the
Reagan administration to subsidize
phone service for low-income families.
Under this legislation, the FCC would
again have authorization to use the
Lifeline program to expand access to
broadband for low-income Americans,
especially seniors, students, veterans,
and disabled Americans.
In response to concerns raised by our
Republican colleagues, the Save the
Internet Act also ensures that the FCC
has the power to protect access to the
internet but does not have authority to
make decisions over internet content
or the power to impose taxes and fees
for internet access.
This legislation forbears the FCC
from applying more than 700 regula-
tions under the Communications Act
that are unnecessary to protecting an
open internet, such as rate setting.
b 1230
Internet service providers have long
claimed that they were hamstrung by
net neutrality protections and that
strong consumer protections were pre-
venting them from investing in higher
speeds and advanced broadband infra-
structure.
In reality, ISPs actually increased
speeds and invested huge amounts in
improving their broadband during the
time when net neutrality protections
were enforced by the FCC. Moreover,
many of the largest providers have
failed to keep their promise of in-
creased investing after the Trump FCC
repealed those protections, with invest-
ments actually shrinking in recent
years.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote for this rule and for both pieces of
legislation underlying it, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I thank my friend from New York for
yielding me the customary 30 minutes.
And, at the risk of opening this debate
like I opened so many others in 2019:
Mr. Speaker, we have taken an oppor-
tunity to do something very productive
and very bipartisan and we have turned
it into something that is going to be
very partisan and wholly unproductive.
Neither of the bills we are consid-
ering in this rule today are going to be
moving through the Senate. Neither of
the bills we are considering today are
going to be signed by the President.
But the good foundation in both of
those bills could have been, and we
have missed yet another opportunity.
Let me start with H.R. 1644, Mr.
Speaker, the so-called Save the Inter-
net Act. I can’t speak for everyone
else’s internet, but my internet is still
thriving. I haven’t seen any nefarious
internet shortages or blockages in re-
cent days.
For the millions and millions of
Americans trying to livestream C–
SPAN right now, they are having no
problems whatsoever. It is going right
through the pipes the way it always
has, Mr. Speaker. And, if it is in need
of saving, it is certainly not in need of
saving from this institution.
I understand, Mr. Speaker, that my
friends on the other side of the aisle
are upset with the Trump administra-
tion’s FCC.
You will recall that the Obama ad-
ministration and its FCC took the reg-
ulations that had governed the inter-
net from its inception through its ex-
plosion of productivity and innovation,
all the way through 2015, and threw all
those rules out entirely, replacing it
with a command-and-control govern-
ment structure.
In its wisdom and with my great sup-
port, the Trump administration and
the FCC threw those new rules out,
taking us back to those rules that pro-
vided the foundation for the internet
and all of the productivity that it has
provided.
It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that
so many folks are afraid of internet
freedom that we need to try to find a
way to clamp down on internet free-
dom and bend the internet to the will
of the government.
I would argue that the Wild West in-
novation style that has driven the
internet and tech companies from day
one shouldn’t be boxed in by the gov-
ernment and certainly shouldn’t be re-
placed with a 1930s-era, Ma Bell tele-
phone regulatory scheme.
That is what we are talking about
here today with this bill, Mr. Speaker,
is turning over regulation of the inter-
net to title II of the Communications
Act.
If you have not looked at title II re-
cently, Mr. Speaker, it is almost 100
years old. It was created to govern that
wonderful emerging technology called
the landline telephone and the monopo-
listic telephone companies that existed
at that time.
I don’t know how many of your staff-
ers still have landline telephones, Mr.
Speaker. I know your grandchildren
probably don’t even know how to oper-
ate one these days.
We certainly should not be relying on
those regulations to bring us forward
with innovation. The heavy hand of
government regulation always takes us
backwards.
The good news, Mr. Speaker, is that,
if you see legitimate challenges out
there, we do have some bipartisan solu-
tions to help address those: Former
Chairman WALDEN’s H.R. 1101, one such
bill that could have been on the floor
today; Mr. LATTA’s H.R. 1006, another
bill that could have been on the floor
today; Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS’ H.R.
1096 could have been on the floor today,
just to name a few.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3143
April 9, 2019
But none of those bipartisan options
were seriously considered. Instead, we
are left with a single option, in true
government, monopolistic fashion, and
that option is to support the Obama
administration’s failed government
takeover of the internet.
Mr. Speaker, I oppose that. I oppose
the legislation. I hope my other col-
leagues will as well.
It did not have to be this way. This
could have been a productive partner-
ship discussion about how to take what
is obviously a productive and innova-
tive tool fueling, not just urban Amer-
ica, not just suburban America, but
rural America, and we could have
talked about how to grow it together.
But we chose a different path, digging
partisan ditches even deeper early in
2019.
If that is not disappointing enough,
Mr. Speaker, there is a second bill that
this rule makes in order. That is H.R.
2021. That bill comes out of another
committee that Mr. MORELLE and I
serve on, the House Budget Committee.
I love serving on the House Budget
Committee, I have to tell you, Mr.
Speaker. It is a wonderful committee
on which to serve. Mr. MORELLE and I
are both lucky to be on it, and we have
two fabulous leaders on that com-
mittee: Mr. YARMUTH of Kentucky
leading the Democratic side of the
aisle and Mr. WOMACK of Arkansas
leading the Republican side of the
aisle.
If you were going to task two leaders
in this institution with crafting the
kind of budget that I talked about from
the well earlier, Mr. Speaker, a budget
that would protect Social Security,
protect Medicare, protect Medicaid, a
budget that would lay out priorities for
America, talk about where it is that we
want to see our children and our grand-
children go in the 21st century, those
are the two leaders who could have
brought us together for the first time
in a long time around a unified vision.
But, instead, the order came down
from on high, Mr. Speaker. There was
to be no budget. I assume that is true.
We have considered absolutely no budg-
et in the so-called Budget Committee.
We have had no budget markup in the
Budget Committee. We have had no
discussions of budget in the Budget
Committee.
Instead, what we have before us
today is a bill that is sometimes re-
ferred to as a caps deal. You have heard
‘‘caps deal’’ before, Mr. Speaker.
It is those times in years past where
we have taken what are those discre-
tionary caps, those limits on how much
Federal money we can spend, and we
have adjusted those so that we can in-
vest in some shared priorities on the
one hand while reducing spending in
some other, lower priority places.
We have done that in a bipartisan
way not once, not twice, but three
times. We could have been here today,
Mr. Speaker, for a fourth time.
If we are not going to actually do a
budget, we still could have been here
on a caps deal. But this is not a caps
deal. This is not a caps bill that had
input from Republicans in the House.
This is not a caps deal that had con-
sultation with the Senate. This is not a
caps deal that has been done in biparti-
sanship with the White House.
This is a caps deal that is just a deal
among warring factions of a divided
Democratic Caucus, and that bill has
come to the floor today—again, a bill
that will not be considered in the Sen-
ate and a bill that will not be signed by
the President.
We can normalize partisan failure in
this institution, Mr. Speaker. We can.
We can also normalize bipartisan co-
operation.
I don’t fault the other side for the
struggles that are, inevitably, going to
happen when a new majority takes
over in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. Leading is a very difficult, dif-
ficult thing to do.
But, at the end of the day, the major-
ity is tasked with doing exactly that—
leading. The Budget Committee should
produce a budget. The United States of
America should have a budget.
It is not easy to do. It is not easy to
pass this House floor. It is not easy to
pass through a committee. But it is
what the law requires us to do; it is
what we have the right leaders on the
Budget Committee to do; and it is what
every single Member in this institution
knows in their heart that we should do.
Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of this
rule, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, let me just make a few
brief comments, and I always appre-
ciate the passion that Mr. WOODALL,
my distinguished friend and colleague,
brings to this discussion.
I do want to say what this is. First of
all, the rule before the House has both
a resolution, which I talked about,
which is really the safety net, it estab-
lishes the $1.295 trillion for discre-
tionary spending and, in addition, al-
lows us to do IRS enforcement—$400
million is in the resolution—and the
census 2020, which is upcoming and
which will take thousands and thou-
sands of people to conduct the census
in the way that the Framers identified
it to be.
It also has a budget bill. And I do
want to just mention just a few points
that relate to what Mr. WOODALL said.
The major components of the budget
are in the budget bill. It provides a top
line for discretionary spending, pro-
vides allocations to the authorizing
committees, provides a revenue floor,
enforces all these 302 allocations, and
sets new caps for discretionary spend-
ing, gives allocations to authorizing
committees, all of these things which
will match the CBO’s baseline, I might
add, and enforcement through regular
Budget Act points of order.
So this does have a budget bill. What
we do with the resolution, however, is
critically important because it makes
sure that we begin this process.
I think the thing that we all want to
avoid in the greatest possible way is a
shutdown. We saw that happen, and
2018 made history.
Although the House, the Senate, and
the White House were all controlled by
the same party, we ended Congress for
the first time in U.S. history in a gov-
ernment shutdown, an inglorious end
to the 115th Congress.
We need to do anything we can. This
starts that process, creates a safety
net, and jump-starts the budget proc-
ess. So this is a completely appropriate
and, in my view, mandatory way to
start this process. And I will perhaps, if
I get a moment or two, talk about the
budget that the President submitted to
us.
I also want to just mention for a mo-
ment, if I can, the comments raised by
my colleague relative to the net neu-
trality bill. This, under the current
rule, has enormous exposure to con-
sumers and businesses. It does not im-
pede innovation, what we are attempt-
ing to do. In fact, in my view, it will
spur innovation, and it provides pre-
dictably for all users, consumers and
businesses alike.
I do note that the rule that we re-
ported out last night ensures that we
do everything we can to reaffirm that
commitment to fair access.
The rule made in order 12 amend-
ments, both from Democrats and Re-
publicans. It is a structured rule. Some
of those amendments I agree with,
some of those I disagree with, but
every single one is worthy of debate on
the floor. I am very proud, and I want
to also congratulate the chair of our
committee, Mr. MCGOVERN, for making
sure that we have amendments from
both sides to discuss on this floor.
I do want to just mention a couple of
them. Several amendments aim to
strengthen access to broadband inter-
net in rural and underserved commu-
nities. Mr. BRINDISI, for instance, has
an amendment which we will take up
which requires the GAO to produce a
report about the ways the U.S. govern-
ment can promote the deployment of
broadband to rural communities.
Representative WEXTON has an
amendment requiring the FCC to sub-
mit to Congress a plan on how the
Commission would address problems in
collecting data on deployment of
broadband. By fixing these problems,
we can have a better understanding of
those communities that are served by
broadband and ensure every commu-
nity has access.
We have an amendment by Rep-
resentative WATERS asking the Comp-
troller General to submit a report on
how net neutrality helps ethnic and ra-
cial minorities and how those rules will
help disadvantaged groups, rural popu-
lations, individuals with disabilities,
and the elderly. Without that full in-
formation, we cannot ensure that ev-
eryone is receiving the same treat-
ment.
We have an amendment from Rep-
resentative DAVIDS directing GAO to

submit a report examining the FCC’s
efforts to assess competition. Col-
leagues are worried about how net neu-
trality rules will impact competition,
but they have no data to back up their
claims, so let’s collect the data we
need. Good policy is always backed by
good evidence.
We also made in order an amendment
by Representative MCADAMS which
would affirm that ISPs can still block
unlawful content, such as child pornog-
raphy. Some content has no place on
the internet, nor anywhere in our
homes, and we want to make sure that
ISPs block this, as they should, and
that nothing in the bill will prevent
them from doing so.
There are several other amendments
made by Democrats that will be on the
floor. I won’t go into them any further.
But I do want to acknowledge, also,
that we have amendments in order sub-
mitted by Republican colleagues as
well.
Mr. LATTA submitted an amendment
requiring the FCC to share the list of
700 rules that will be permanently
forborne once this bill becomes law,
which makes sense to me. We had this
conversation in rules yesterday, to ask
the question what those 700 rules are.
The FCC has determined them to be
unnecessary and burdensome.
Let’s look at them and see what they
are. Let’s see the list. Let’s show the
American people that the government
was not regulating for the sake of regu-
lating and that, when those regulations
are no longer appropriate, we will re-
move them.
Finally, my colleagues on the Rules
Committee made Representative BUR-
GESS’ amendment in order. It directs
the GAO to initiate a study to examine
the virtuous cycle of the internet eco-
system and the effect of net neutrality
on that ecosystem—again, an amend-
ment which was made in order to make
sure that we have bipartisan discussion
here on the floor.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to respond to my friend from New
York, but I just have too many speak-
ers who have come down to the House
floor today to speak about this.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE),
a member of the Rules Committee, our
ranking member on the Rules Com-
mittee, a member of the Appropria-
tions Committee, and one of the most
thoughtful Members of the Republican
Conference.
b 1245
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank my good friend, a member of the
Budget Committee, for yielding, and
my colleague on the Rules Committee.
I rise to oppose the rule and oppose
the underlying legislation. Now, I op-
pose the rule because it is not really a
rule at all. It is really legislation
masking as a rule.
Buried in this rule is a measure that
will, what we call self-execute, but
deem what the budget is going to be. In
other words, our friends are telling us:
We may not have the votes, even
though we have a substantial majority,
to pass our own caps bill. But just in
case, the rule vote, which is a partisan
vote, we are going to put it in here.
Now, that doesn’t speak to a high de-
gree of confidence that my friends will
have the votes, which they should
have, on their caps deal. I would argue
it is technically legal, but it is not a
very seemly practice to actually ex-
press your distrust of your own major-
ity that directly.
Second, let’s talk a little bit about
the underlying legislation. There is a
lot here I don’t agree with, but I want
to focus on one thing in particular, Mr.
Speaker, and that is the ‘‘budget’’
itself, because it is not a budget. It is
a caps bill.
It is not even a caps deal. It hasn’t
been negotiated with the Senate. It
hasn’t been negotiated with the admin-
istration. It is an arbitrary number. It
has no chance of becoming law. There
is no way a Republican Senate will
have double the amount of increase for
domestic programs as it has for de-
fense. It is just not going to happen.
So, now, the Appropriations Com-
mittee—and I am always happy to have
numbers as an appropriator—will now
move on down with a set of numbers
that we know will not survive negotia-
tions with the Senate or with the
President. So we are going to mark up
a lot of bills, but they are going to be
the numbers that are a fantasy.
Finally, in this caps deal, we ought
to point out, our own rules require the
majority to present a budget. We
couldn’t even get a budget out of the
Democratic Budget Committee. Now,
that is a failure to govern.
The Speaker, herself, said on one oc-
casion: Show me your budget, and I
will show you your values.
It suggests that you don’t want to
show the American people your values,
because you certainly aren’t showing
us a budget in this legislation.
So the rule, frankly, is a backdoor
way to enact some sort of caps legisla-
tion, caps legislation that will not be
accepted by the Senate, that will not
be accepted by the President of the
United States.
The underlying legislation doesn’t
have a budget, which our own rules re-
quire that it have. It has a mere state-
ment of spending levels that, again, are
not going to be accepted by the other
Chamber or by the President of the
United States.
And, finally, our friends have abdi-
cated their most important responsi-
bility, which is showing the American
people their view and their vision of
what the budget ought to shape.
The rule ought to be rejected; the un-
derlying legislation ought to be re-
jected; and our friends ought to chal-
lenge themselves to bring us a budget
that they can support, that they can
put in front of the American people.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I appreciate my good friend, the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma’s comments.
Those on the other side may say this
is messy, but do you know what is
messier? Another government shut-
down.
We just endured, earlier this year, a
35-day government shutdown, the long-
est shutdown in our history. In this
committee, we are committed to doing
everything in our power to prevent
that from happening again.
We want to make sure we can move
forward with appropriations legisla-
tion, and this provision is a safety net
to assure that process can begin. When-
ever a budget bill comes up, whenever
we begin that appropriations process,
we will have a path forward.
My good friend raised the question of
the President. I have to admit I am
new here, haven’t been here very long.
I have been involved in the budget
process in the State of New York for
many years.
Frankly, watching the budget and
looking at the budget submitted by the
President, I would be embarrassed. I
think it is no wonder that my friends
on the other side of the aisle didn’t
submit, as an amendment, the Presi-
dent’s budget.
The President’s budget is dev-
astating. I look to how it would dev-
astate the people in my home State of
New York: repeals the Affordable Care
Act, eliminates health insurance for 2.2
million New Yorkers, abolishes protec-
tions for people with preexisting condi-
tions, substantially increases pre-
miums for older Americans.
If the budget that Donald Trump sub-
mitted became law, a 60-year-old living
in New York making $25,000 a year
could see their healthcare premiums
increase by up to $5,000 annually, from
$1,600 to $6,300 in 2020, a quarter of
their income.
It cuts funding for New York’s Med-
icaid program by $159 billion over the
next 10 years. Nationally, the Trump
budget proposes to cut Medicaid by $1.5
trillion over the next 10 years, 36 per-
cent in 2029 alone.
College would be more expensive for
179,000 New Yorkers by completely
eliminating the Direct Subsidized Loan
Program and taking away grants for
108,000 students by abolishing the Sup-
plemental Education Opportunity
Grant program. At a time when people
need to have knowledge more than at
any other time in human history to
safeguard their economic future and
those of their families, to cut college
programs is reprehensible.
But I don’t care just about New
Yorkers, Mr. Speaker. My friend from
Georgia, I have a brother who lives in
Georgia. His children live in Georgia. I
care a great deal about the people in
Georgia as well.
The Trump budget:
Eliminates after-school programs for
41,000 Georgia students by zeroing out
the 21st Century Community Learning
Centers program;
Takes away high-quality childcare
and early education for 4,200 low-in-
come Georgia children by cutting Head

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3145
April 9, 2019
Start by 17 percent in the final year of
this budget;
Eliminates nutrition assistance for
up to 395,000 Georgians, 90 percent of
whom live in households with at least

Takes the food out of the mouths of
4,000 pregnant women, new moms, ba-
bies, and toddlers in Georgia by cutting

I could go on and on, Mr. Speaker,
but I will spare my colleagues a long
dissertation on the Trump budget,
other than recognize that this House is
moving forward. We are beginning this
process. We have established a safety
net.
This is what Americans want. They
don’t want another shutdown. And we
are going to do everything in our
power—together, I hope, in a bipartisan
way—to make sure that we continue to
move forward in the years to come.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself 30 seconds just to say that my
friend’s criticisms of the Trump budget
are perfectly legitimate. What he failed
to mention, though, is the reason he
can make those criticisms is because
the law required the administration to
offer a budget, and it did. The law also
requires this House to offer a budget,
and we have not.
We are better than that. This is not
an Article II responsibility. This is an
Article I responsibility, and we will rue
the day that we decided that we would
rather talk about what Article II was
doing instead of doing the work our-
selves here at Article I.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
MEUSER), a new Member of this institu-
tion and a member of the Budget Com-
mittee.
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in opposition to this rule and to
H.R. 1644, also known as the govern-
ment-controlled internet act.
Once again, House Democrats are
putting Federal Government control
over freedom and bringing to the floor
yet another partisan, central command
government bill.
H.R. 1644, or the government-con-
trolled internet act, which, fortu-
nately, has no chance of being signed
into law, goes against everything that
made the internet what it is today.
There is a reason the United States is
home to the top internet companies in
the world. This doesn’t happen by acci-
dent. It is because of the laissez faire
approach that allows for an environ-
ment of economic growth, competition,
and innovation.
Instead of building on the pro-inno-
vation approach that has revolution-
ized how we communicate, work, and
stay connected, this legislation would
impose heavy-handed, top-down regula-
tions that would box the internet into
outdated rules written in the 1930s.
Why is the Democratic majority sup-
porting a bill that will take the inter-
net backwards?
This bill is the quintessential solu-
tion in search of a problem. If we want
to protect constituents, promote in-
vestment, and encourage innovation,
H.R. 1644 is not the solution.
If my colleagues across the aisle are
serious about protecting consumers
and ensuring access to a free and open
internet, then we need to find bipar-
tisan consensus on net neutrality prin-
ciples that address blocking, throt-
tling, and paid prioritization. We need
a modern framework that allows for
continued American innovation and in-
vestment, not another Federal Govern-
ment regulatory takeover.
H.R. 1644 is not a serious solution to
protecting our constituents and ad-
vancing American ingenuity. I urge my
colleagues to oppose this effort and
send a clear message that we need to
move the internet forward, not back-
ward. I hope they will oppose this rule
and the underlying legislation.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. BURGESS), a member of the Energy
and Commerce Committee and the
Rules Committee.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
As you know, the difficulty is, when
we take away the managing of a busi-
ness operation from that underlying
business, the incentive to innovate and
to serve consumers is likely to dis-
sipate.
The internet, for decades, has thrived
because it was not under the heavy
hand of government. Because of this
freedom, we are now on the brink of ac-
cessing the fifth generation of
broadband technology that, when fully
implemented, will eliminate the need
for net neutrality regulations because
latency for all content will be almost
zero.
I don’t think you find any disagree-
ment that blocking, throttling, and
paid prioritization are not practices
that anyone wants as a part of the open
internet. But classifying broadband
internet as a telecommunications serv-
ice under title II of the Telecommuni-
cation Act of 1934 will limit the ability
of service providers to respond to con-
sumer demands and potentially result
in disruptions due to content neu-
trality requirements.
Republicans have introduced three
proposals to preserve a free and open
internet. I hope we can work together,
going forward, to achieve that laudable
goal.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I do note for my friend, Mr. BURGESS,
whom I serve on the Rules Committee
with, that we, in an effort to enhance
bipartisanship, made his amendment in
order. I believe it is the first amend-
ment in order, and I certainly expect
that it will get broad consideration on
both sides of the aisle.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
a letter from over 120 businesses and
startups urging Congress to support
net neutrality. This letter says: ‘‘Pass-
ing H.R. 1644 will provide certainty for
businesses and startups and would en-
sure critical consumer protections for
all internet users.’’
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Republican Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: We are writing in support of H.R. 1644,
the Save the Internet Act, to fully restore
the strong net neutrality protections for
Internet users that were adopted through the
FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order but later re-
pealed.
Net neutrality is fundamental to guaran-
teeing that every American has
unencumbered access to the Internet. This
access is also essential to a competitive, free
market for the technology economy to
thrive as well as entrepreneurship in this
country. The benefits of these protections
are not confined to technology companies
and startups. Main Street businesses across
numerous sectors increasingly rely on unfet-
tered Internet access to run their operations
and to reach customers.
Net neutrality has been critical to the
Internet’s explosive growth, creating an open
platform on which companies large and
small can grow. We urge members of Con-
gress to stand on the side of consumers and
Internet users to quickly pass a clean,
unamended version of H.R. 1644. This bill
would restore strong rules prohibiting block-
ing, throttling, and paid-prioritization while
reinstating ex-ante enforcement and over-
sight by the FCC to prevent net neutrality-
related harms from happening in the first
place.
Passing H.R. 1644 will provide certainty for
businesses and startups and would ensure
critical consumer protections for all Inter-
net users.

Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
My friend from New York is right:
They did make a number of amend-
ments in order, but not enough amend-
ments to solve some underlying prob-
lems.
One amendment they didn’t make in
order was an amendment to provide
disaster funding to so many of our
communities that have been waiting on
disaster funding—not for a day, not for
a week, not for a month, but, now, into
the new year.
If we defeat the previous question
today, we can correct that injustice,
and I will bring up an amendment to
the rule to make this disaster funding
possible. It is critically important.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN
SCOTT) to talk about that, one of the
greatest advocates for that language
here in the House.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to urge my col-
leagues to defeat the previous question
so the House can immediately bring up
meaningful disaster relief.
I want to thank my friends and col-
leagues from across the aisle, Rep-
resentative WOODALL, obviously, Chair-
man MCGOVERN, Ranking Member
COLE, and others on the Rules Com-
mittee, for allowing me to speak last
night on behalf of the amendment. I
also want to thank them for their help
in previously passing very similar leg-
islation.
My amendment is quite simple. The
text contained the same dollar-for-dol-
lar amounts from H.R. 268, the House-
passed disaster assistance bill.
This bill was a work of compromise
and work that many of us representing
districts that have been hit by disas-
ters in 2018 worked on. It includes a bi-
partisan amendment that I and many
others sponsored, which raised the crop
and livestock loss assistance to $3 bil-
lion, from approximately $1 billion.
That is included in the final text.
Unfortunately, my amendment was
not made in order; but, if we defeat the
previous question, it will be included in
an amendment, along with other im-
portant provisions, to help those af-
fected by the natural disasters of 2018.
Disaster relief has never been a par-
tisan issue in the United States of
America, and it should not be a par-
tisan issue today. I urge my colleagues
and I ask every Member in this body to
defeat the previous question so that we
can immediately bring up legislation
to deliver on our promise of passing
disaster assistance prior to leaving for
the Easter break.
b 1300
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I might consume.
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the senti-
ments of the gentleman. We certainly
agree.
The House has passed disaster relief.
We await Senate conferees, so we can
move that process forward. But what
strikes me is how troubling it is to
have this conversation.
The reality is that the President of
the United States has chosen which
Americans to provide aid to. The island
of Puerto Rico, American citizens, has
suffered disasters, calamities, as a re-
sult of Hurricane Maria, yet the Presi-
dent shows no indication that he un-
derstands the plight of the people on
Puerto Rico. That is why it is nec-
essary for the House and Senate to
come together to provide relief, be-
cause the President, frankly, has cho-
sen not to do it.
We welcome the comments by the
gentleman. We look forward to the
Senate establishing members of a con-
ference committee, so we can work out
differences that we may have and move
this forward. We continue to hope for
that day and hope that the President
will gain some enlightenment about
how we help and protect all American
citizens.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, as we
have heard so often on the House floor,
hopeful wishes are not enough for our
constituents. We need to deliver re-
sults.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN),
who has been working hard in that di-
rection.
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to demand that critical natural dis-
aster relief be voted upon.
Tomorrow will be the 6-month anni-
versary of Hurricane Michael, 6 months
with absolutely no disaster supple-
mental funding, no serious action on
the part of Congress except the polit-
ical farce in the House and two failed
cloture votes in the Senate.
Both Chambers have refused to ex-
tend even routine tax relief to ensure
that people have access to their money
when they need it most. With tax day
just around the corner, this is unac-
ceptable.
Floridians are tough, but they need
help and deserve help.
Six months ago, Hurricane Michael
devastated the South, damaging more
than 90 percent of the structures on
Tyndall Air Force Base, decimating
our agricultural industry, and destroy-
ing entire communities. Yet, here we
are with only 1 day left in the legisla-
tive calendar before Easter and no tax
relief in sight.
If the previous question is defeated,
it will be a first step in making some
meaningful progress for victims of all
the 2018 disasters. It will bring the Dis-
aster Tax Relief Act of 2019 to the
floor. I am a proud cosponsor of that
bill with TOM RICE and AUSTIN SCOTT.
This bill includes a set of common,
routine tax breaks victims of virtually
every disaster over the last decade
have been entitled to, things like ac-
cess to retirement savings without pen-
alty, a tax credit for employers who
continue to pay employees while shut
down, suspending tax limitations on
charitable contributions for relief ef-
forts, and allowing hardworking fami-
lies to use earned income from the pre-
vious year to calculate their earned in-
come tax credits and child tax credits.
It is a shame that we have to resort
to a procedural trick to ask for a vote
on this very bipartisan, commonsense
legislation that we have passed many
times before.
Mr. Speaker, it is time we take ac-
tion to help those suffering from the
2018 disasters. For this reason, I urge a
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I would just reiterate
what I said earlier, which is that all
Americans need help in times of dis-
aster.
Despite the fact that some would try
to ignore the fact that climate change
exists and has created natural disasters
that we could not have predicted years
ago, the fact is that those disasters
continue to happen.
All Americans—I don’t care whether
you live in New York or Alabama,
Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands—all Americans need help.
One of the first bills we passed under
a structured rule in this Congress was
to provide that relief, yet it sits in the
Senate because they seek to choose
which Americans get benefited by the
Federal Government’s relief efforts and
which do not.
We are going to stand firmly in the
corner of all Americans getting the
support from the Federal Government
that they deserve. We are not going to
pick and choose.
Mr. Speaker, I certainly hope that
my colleagues here across the aisle are
going to march across to the other
Chamber and insist to the United
States Senate that it takes up that
bill, that we establish a conference
committee, and that we send this to
the White House.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time, and I
would say to my friend from New York,
we do not have any further speakers re-
maining, so if he would like to get this
show on the road, I am prepared to
close if he is.
Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for
my friend from New York on the Rules
Committee, and I really do enjoy serv-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3147
April 9, 2019
It is neat to be on the Budget Com-
mittee as a freshman because you are
working with the biggest issues that
we have in this country. We all care
about healthcare and how it gets im-
plemented, but we can’t implement it
if we can’t pay for it, so the Budget
Committee grapples with those issues.
We all want our seniors to be pro-
tected. They have been paying into
Medicare and Social Security their en-
tire lives, but we know those programs
are headed toward bankruptcy. We
can’t solve those problems except in
the overarching look of a Federal budg-
et process. It is what the law requires.
We get to talk about those big ideas.
We get to think those big thoughts. We
get to come together to make big and,
yes, Mr. Speaker, difficult decisions.
President Trump, in his budget, made
difficult decisions. I dare say I could go
Member to Member in this Chamber
and find 435 people out of 435 who
would find at least one flaw in the
President’s budget. I bet I could.
It is hard to write a budget for the
United States of America, but the law
requires that we do it. More impor-
tantly, even if the law didn’t require
that we do it, Mr. Speaker, we know
that we should. We know the Constitu-
tion lays out that responsibility, the
power of the purse, for the House. We
have constituted an entire committee
called the Budget Committee.
I don’t want to wow you, Mr. Speak-
er, with my eloquence, but do you
know what the responsibility of the
Budget Committee is? It only has one:
write the budget.
For years, there was a time when the
Senate was not taking up budgets in
its Budget Committee. I wondered why
they didn’t disband the Budget Com-
mittee because the only job the Budget
Committee has is to write the budget.
We know we need to do that to-
gether. We know we do, but we are not.
The second bill this rule makes in
order is the government takeover of
the internet bill. Again, if you think
the internet is broken and the benevo-
lent hand of government can fix it, this
is the bill for you. If you think the
internet is not broken and perhaps gov-
ernment ought to stay where govern-
ment is, and the freedom of the inter-
net should continue, this is not the bill
for you.
We need to defeat both of these bills,
and we need to defeat the rule.
I do want to point out, for the Rules
Committee, we were working just be-
yond those doors last night, Mr. Speak-
er, and I think the Rules Committee
did the best it could with the material
that it had to work with. I see the staff
director of the Rules Committee sit-
ting over there. He has a tough job.
I think the chairman did the best he
could. You cannot solve the problem of
a flawed, partisan committee process
with the inclusion of amendments in
the Rules Committee. You just can’t do
it. But they tried as hard as they pos-
sibly could, making in order as many
amendments as they could to try to
satisfy as many concerns as they could.
The problem is not the Rules Com-
mittee, Mr. Speaker. That is not why
we need to defeat the rules today. The
problem is the leadership decision that
has been made to bring up these two
flawed products that were created in a
partisan way when we could have
brought to the floor two positive prod-
ucts created in a collaborative way.
We have to make a decision in this
Chamber. Either we are in the business
of making a point or we are in the busi-
ness of making a difference. So far, the
first 4 months of this year, we have
been great at making a point, but we
have been struggling to make a dif-
ference.
Like it or not, we have a Senate that
has to pass this legislation and a Presi-
dent who has to sign it if we are to
make it the law of the land. The two
products today fail that test.
Let’s not waste another moment on
them, Mr. Speaker, not another mo-
ment. Let’s reject this rule. Let’s not
bring these two pieces of legislation to
the floor. Let’s go back to the drawing
board collaboratively, as we know we
can. Lock any bipartisan group of
Members into a room together, Mr.
Speaker, and they will craft a better
solution. We have the right leaders in
this Chamber for this time. We just
need to free them up to lead.
Defeat this rule. Defeat the previous
question.
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to
the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate the
passion that Mr. WOODALL brings to
conversations, both here on the floor as
well as in the two committees on which
we are privileged to serve. I thank him
for that and thank him for his concerns
about how we move forward.
I believe this is moving forward.
Today, we are moving forward. We set
the tone of how we move forward. We
establish our discretionary amount. We
end the sequestration caps. We begin to
move forward, and I think that is what
we want to do.
It is fascinating. I note that Mr.
WOODALL, in his comments, mentioned
you can’t get all 435 Members to agree.
I certainly understand that, and I ap-
preciate it. We couldn’t get one Mem-
ber to offer the President’s budget as
an amendment.
The truth is that there is a failure of
leadership here. This is a process that
is new to me, but I certainly expected
that the President would provide great-
er leadership on how to move forward.
We have seen none from the White
House, which I find troubling and I find
puts us at a considerable disadvantage.
We need to move forward, nonethe-
less, Mr. Speaker, and that is what we
are doing today.
I do know that, for me, the amount
of discretionary investments we make
will say a great deal about where we
are going as a country and what our
priorities are.
I think we need to make greater in-
vestments in education and in public
health, highways and transit, veterans
healthcare, agricultural research,
workplace safety, K–12 education sup-
port, national parks, housing assist-
ance and mortgage insurance, small
business assistance, Head Start, food
safety, scientific research and space ex-
ploration—God knows, as a percentage
of GDP, we need to continue to invest
dramatically in those—embassy secu-
rity, Pell grants for higher education
students, hazardous waste cleanup, wa-
terway maintenance for commerce and
recreation, weather forecasting, hurri-
cane-proofing communities, forest and
wildlife habitat management, con-
servation resources, patents and trade-
marks, consumer protections, and avia-
tion safety.
The list goes on and on for the kind
of investments we need to make to con-
tinue to make sure that America leads
in the 21st century. That is what this
does today. That is what this rule will
do. That is what the resolution budget
process starts today.
Mr. Speaker, I thank all my col-
leagues for their words of support for
H.R. 2021, the Investing for the People
Act. I especially thank Chairman YAR-
MUTH and Ranking Member WOMACK for
their work on our Nation’s budget.
I also thank Chairman PALLONE and
Ranking Member WALDEN and all those
who have worked on H.R. 1644, the Save
the Internet Act.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the rule, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the
previous question.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows:
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:

BUILDING ON REEMPLOYMENT IM-
PROVEMENTS TO DELIVER GOOD
EMPLOYMENT FOR WORKERS
ACT
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules
and pass the bill (H.R. 1759) to amend
title III of the Social Security Act to
extend reemployment services and eli-
gibility assessments to all claimants
for unemployment compensation, and
for other purposes, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1759
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Building on
Reemployment Improvements to Deliver
Good Employment for Workers Act’’ or the
‘‘BRIDGE for Workers Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Pub-
lic Law 115–123) improved program account-
ability for effectively serving unemployed
workers and made a significant new invest-
ment in reemployment services.
(2) Research shows the longer workers are
out of work, the harder it can be to maintain
their skills, professional network, and stable
home life.
(3) Reemployment services give workers
who might otherwise struggle to find new
jobs the tools that they need to get back to
work—such as individualized career coun-
seling and job search help as well as local
labor market information—and they can
serve as an entry point to the workforce de-
velopment system.
(4) Reemployment services have been dem-
onstrated to reduce the number of weeks
that program participants receive unemploy-
ment benefits by improving their employ-
ment outcomes, including earnings.
(5) Unemployment benefits replace less
than half of working income, on average, so
workers who find new jobs quickly suffer less
financial hardship.
(6) Combining targeted reemployment
services with unemployment benefits helps
keep people attached to the labor force who
might otherwise become discouraged and
drop out.
(7) The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that, over time, investments in reem-
ployment services create savings for tax-
payers and unemployment trust funds by re-
ducing spending on unemployment benefits.
(8) Many different types of workers can
benefit from reemployment services. Reem-
ployment services should be used to shorten
the duration of unemployment for workers
even if they are not projected to fully ex-
haust their unemployment benefits.
SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR REEMPLOYMENT SERV-
ICES.
Section 306(a) of the Social Security Act
(42 U.S.C. 506(a)) is amended—
(1) by striking ‘‘individuals referred to re-
employment services as described in section
303(j)’’ and inserting ‘‘claimants for unem-
ployment compensation, including claimants
referred to reemployment services as de-
scribed in section 303(j),’’; and
(2) by striking ‘‘such individuals’’ and in-
serting ‘‘such claimants’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS) and the
gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.
WALORSKI) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members have 5 legislative days to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill
under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1759, the BRIDGE
for Workers Act, continues our com-
mittee’s bipartisan work to help Amer-
icans who are receiving earned unem-
ployment insurance benefits to get
back to work faster.
Unemployment benefits are a vital
lifeline for Americans who have lost
their jobs, helping them keep the lights
on and pay the rent while they search
for work. But unemployment benefits
replace less than half of a worker’s
paycheck, on average. Especially for
lower paid workers, who may not have
any savings to fall back on, the best
outcome is to find a new job as quickly
as possible.
When you lose your job, it can be dif-
ficult to find a new one, especially if
you are older, haven’t looked for a job
in a long time, or have made mistakes
in the past. Reemployment services
give people looking for help the per-
sonal help they need to overcome those
barriers.
For instance, States might provide
assistance targeted to a claimant’s
needs, things like customized career
and labor market information, help
with application materials, or allowing
them to practice for tough job inter-
views.
Last year, we passed important legis-
lation to improve reemployment serv-
ices and eligibility assessment grants,
or RESEAs. Our legislation added im-
portant worker protections, gave
States incentives to improve the qual-
ity of the services being provided for
workers, and ensured that sufficient
funding is available in every State and
territory.
When I asked how RESEA grants
were being used in my home State of
Illinois, they told me about Tara, who
struggled to find a new job after she
was laid off, both because her skills
weren’t up to date for the current labor
market and because she had a criminal
record. The Illinois RESEA helped her
upgrade her job skills and find a job
with an employer willing to take a
chance, a chance on someone who had
made mistakes. She is now working
and going to school to get an associ-
ate’s degree in welding, so she will
have better pay and benefits in the fu-
ture.
The BRIDGE for Workers Act would
add important and needed flexibility to
allow States to serve all workers who
could benefit from reemployment serv-
ices, not just those who are expected to
run out of benefits before finding work.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
a letter from the National Association
of State Workforce Agencies endorsing
the BRIDGE for Workers Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3149
April 9, 2019
(NASWA) to endorse the BRIDGE for Work-
ers Act and express our appreciation of your
bipartisan effort to authorize the Reemploy-
ment Services and Eligibility Assessments
(RESEA) program as part of the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115–245).
Until the passage of the Act, RESEA had
been limited to a widely-successful pilot
grant program. Today, States around the na-
tion now have the ability to accelerate un-
employment insurance (UI) claimants’ tran-
sition back to employment faster than non-
participants, which is particularly important
in an economy desperately in need of skilled
workers.
To enhance these efforts, we are pleased to
see the proposed minor statutory fix pro-
posed in the BRIDGE for Workers Act that
reflects your intent to ensure any UI claim-
ant, not just those most likely to exhaust
their benefits, are eligible for RESEA serv-
ices and assessments. The current language
in Section 306 of Act needs to be modified to
ensure this intent is actualized and while the
Appropriations Committee made such a
modification in their FY 19 Labor-HHS Ap-
propriations bill, a permanent fix would pro-
vide clarity and stability for states actively
focused on helping claimants return to work
expeditiously.
NASWA is the national organization rep-
resenting all 50 state workforce agencies,
D.C. and U.S. territories. These agencies de-
liver training, employment, career, and busi-
ness services, in addition to administering
the unemployment insurance, veteran reem-
ployment, and labor market information
programs. NASWA provides policy expertise,
shares promising state practices, and pro-
motes state innovation and leadership in
workforce development.
Thank you for your consideration of this
request.
Sincerely,
JON PIERPONT,
NASWA Board Presi-
dent, Executive Di-
rector, Utah Depart-
ment of Workforce
Services.
SCOTT B. SANDERS,
NASWA Executive Di-
rector.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, the BRIDGE for Workers Act
will ensure that more workers who
need reemployment services get them.
Those individuals and workers, like
Tara, will get back to work faster, in
better jobs, and on a path to a better
future.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the BRIDGE for Workers Act,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
1759, the Building on Reemployment
Improvements to Deliver Good Em-
ployment for Workers Act, also known
as the BRIDGE for Workers Act, which
I have worked on with my colleagues,
Representative MURPHY and Represent-
ative LAHOOD.
This legislation builds upon the Bi-
partisan Budget Act of 2018, where we
made a significant step forward in
helping those unemployed, through no
fault of their own, by pairing unem-
ployment benefits with services.
Over the last few decades, there has
been a focus on automation that has
removed all human interaction from
the benefit claims process. Bene-
ficiaries have become nothing more
than a number entered into a spread-
sheet or into a computer database.
During the last recession, we saw
that merely providing 99 weeks of un-
employment benefits was not enough
to help individuals return to the work-
force. That is why, in 2012, we offered
reemployment services and eligibility
assessments, known as RESEAs, to the
long-term unemployed based on suc-
cessful State efforts to engage UI bene-
ficiaries.
Since the recession, many States
have rebranded unemployment to re-
employment, and focused on efforts to
promote rapid reemployment, because
it is better for workers, their families,
and an economy where we have 1 mil-
lion more job openings than we have
employed.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018
provides States with funding certainty,
so they can invest in these services and
serve greater numbers of workers. That
is why H.R. 1759 is so important. It
makes permanent a technical correc-
tion first made in FY 2019 appropria-
tions.
This bill clarifies that reemployment
services and eligibility assessments
shall promote quicker reemployment
to shorten benefit durations for all un-
employment insurance claimants, not
just those likely to exhaust unemploy-
ment benefits.
In my home State of Indiana, RESEA
was redesigned in 2016 to assist UI
claimants through early intervention
to aid in a quicker return to meaning-
ful employment and eliminate UI
fraud.
Indiana’s RESEA program is two-
fold. The initial RESEA expects bene-
ficiaries to make an in-person visit to
a WorkOne Center on approximately
the sixth week of benefits. During that
visit, they attend an orientation to
learn more about these services, and
then meet with a RESEA counselor for
a one-on-one assessment interview to
develop an individual reemployment
plan. That plan may include workshops
to improve job search or interviewing
skills, or referrals to other supports or
services beyond the UI agency.
Any of the RESEA initial partici-
pants who are still collecting at the
15th week of their UI claim are con-
tacted for reengagement as part of the
subsequent RESEA program. These
long-term claimants are brought in for
a one-on-one reassessment interview to
determine if additional barriers to re-
employment are present. At any point
in the process where it becomes appar-
ent that additional, more intensive
services are needed, the customer then
moves into the workforce system to
gain more skills.
RESEAS are a valuable reemploy-
ment tool for those who have lost their
job, through no fault of their own.
Again, I urge support of H.R. 1759,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 4
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Mrs. MURPHY), the sponsor of
the bill.
Mrs. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today as the proud sponsor of this bill,
the BRIDGE for Workers Act. I want to
express my gratitude to the three
original cosponsors of this bipartisan
legislation: Congresswoman WALORSKI,
Congresswoman TORRES SMALL, and
Congressman LAHOOD. I also thank
Chairman NEAL and Ranking Member
BRADY for their leadership on the com-
mittee, and Chairman DANNY DAVIS
and his staff for all the work they have
done on this bill to prepare it for floor
consideration.
Mr. Speaker, no American worker
wants to be unemployed, and it is vital
for our government to provide cost-ef-
fective support during that challenging
and stressful time. Our focus should be
on giving unemployed workers the
skills and resources required to return
to the workforce as quickly as possible.
We want everyone to feel the sense of
dignity that comes with earning a pay-
check, providing for their family, and
contributing to our economy.
One way we support unemployed
workers is through the Reemployment
Services and Eligibility Assessment
program. This program, administered
by the Department of Labor, makes an-
nual grants to States and territories to
provide a range of services to recipi-
ents of unemployment benefits. Serv-
ices include individual career coun-
seling, assistance with job searches,
and information on the local job mar-
ket.
Under current law, States can only
use these grants to assist workers who
are expected to exhaust their unem-
ployment benefits without having
found a job. That is an unnecessary re-
striction that prevents many unem-
ployed workers from getting valuable
assistance.
Our bill would remove this restric-
tion and allow States to use their
grants to provide support to any indi-
vidual receiving unemployment bene-
fits, as long as the State believes these
services would help the individual re-
turn to work more quickly. We pro-
vided a 1-year patch in the 2019 appro-
priations bill to make this change tem-
porarily, but this bill would make it
permanent.
This is a critical step because re-
search shows the longer workers are
out of work, the harder it can be to
maintain their skills, their profes-
sional networks, and a stable home
life. By combining targeted reemploy-
ment services with unemployment in-
surance benefits, we will help keep peo-
ple attached to the labor force who
might otherwise become discouraged
and give up looking for a job.
In my home State of Florida, it is es-
timated this bill could provide up to
25,000 additional individuals claiming
unemployment benefits each week with
access to reemployment services.
Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask my
colleagues to support the bipartisan
BRIDGE for Workers Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3150 April 9, 2019
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD).
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Mrs. WALORSKI for her hard work on
this particular piece of legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of H.R. 1759, the BRIDGE for
Workers Act, also known as the Build-
ing on Reemployment Improvements to
Deliver Good Employment for Workers
Act. I am also proud to join Congress-
woman MURPHY, Congresswoman
TORRES SMALL, and Congressman
DAVIS, my colleague from Illinois, in
being part of this bipartisan legisla-
tion.
Since becoming a member of the
Ways and Means Committee, I have
been focused on closing the JOBS Act,
improving workforce development, and
removing barriers to employment.
It is incumbent upon our Federal
Government, in coordination with
States and local governments, to en-
sure that those looking for a job have
the necessary tools and skills they
need to get back into the workforce.
Last Congress, we worked in a bipar-
tisan fashion to codify into law the Re-
employment Services and Eligibility
Assessments program, bolstering its
funding and improving the effective-
ness. These reemployment services in-
clude career counseling, resume sup-
port, individualized reemployment
plans, and access to trainings for those
receiving unemployment insurance.
The goal of this program is to pro-
mote rapid reemployment and, ulti-
mately, shorten benefit durations for
all unemployment insurance claim-
ants, not just those most likely to ex-
haust all benefits.
This bill makes a technical correc-
tion to ensure that States have the
flexibility to provide reemployment
services to all insurance claimants
from a variety of backgrounds and help
them return to work more quickly.
This legislation builds on the recent
law that improved the reemployment
service program and will ensure that
those in need of these services will be
able to access them.
With over 7 million unfilled jobs in
this country, it is crucial we work with
our States, including my home State of
Illinois, to provide the necessary re-
sources to fill these jobs. Finding
skilled workers is one of the number
one issues in my district and many dis-
tricts across the country: finding
enough relief welders, truck drivers,
construction workers, machinists,
nurses, technicians, just to name a few.
Empowering individuals to get off
the sideline and back into the work-
force is something this body should al-
ways strive to achieve. Every week
that a person is out of work, through
no fault of their own, is a week too
long. This bipartisan fix to reemploy-
ment will help these individuals get
back to receiving what they want
most: a job and a paycheck.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues
on the Ways and Means Committee for
their support on this legislation, and I
urge its passage in the House.
b 1330
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY
CHU).
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise to support the BRIDGE
Act, which would ensure that all unem-
ployment insurance beneficiaries could
use reemployment service grants to get
back to work sooner. Currently, only
unemployed individuals who are likely
to exhaust their unemployment bene-
fits have access to these grants.
I know this change will make an im-
pact in my district. In Pasadena, Cali-
fornia, the Employment Development
Department administers this program,
which offers an orientation to dis-
located workers. At the orientations,
these clients are given a tour of all the
services available, including partner
services under the Workforce Innova-
tion and Opportunity Act, and they are
then able to pick out a service that
best fits their needs.
But this change would allow all indi-
viduals to have access to this program
and will help coordinate services better
so that staff can help these individuals
so that they don’t have to figure it out
on their own, and then more dislocated
workers in my community could find
work more quickly.
It would help people like Hector. Just
last week, I met with the Los Angeles
Workforce Development Board and
they told me his story.
Hector lost his job as an account
manager, where he was making $44.71
per hour. This forced him to seek pub-
lic assistance to make ends meet for
himself and his family.
Through the help of the staff at the
East Los Angeles/West San Gabriel
Valley America’s Job Center of Cali-
fornia, Hector was able to receive a re-
ferral for an interview with the
Maintco Corporation and was provided
a bus pass that enabled him to get to
the interview. He was able to quickly
secure employment as a finance con-
troller and is now making $55 an hour,
which is $11 more than when he lost his
job.
We must pass this bill to make sure
that individuals who lose their jobs are
not out of the workforce for too long. I
applaud my colleague, STEPHANIE MUR-
PHY, for introducing this bill, and I
urge my colleagues to vote for it.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. ESTES).
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.
WALORSKI) for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I want to mention that
I, too, rise today in support of H.R.
1759, the BRIDGE for Workers Act.
This technical correction bill builds on
the progress we made in last year’s
budget act to provide reemployment
services to help get more people back
to work faster and easier.
While the intent of last year’s law
was to allow job counselors to consult
with unemployed individuals as soon as
possible, oftentimes implementation of
the law led to this happening only in
cases where unemployment benefits
were set to expire.
Today’s bill realigns reemployment
services and eligibility assessment
with the original intent of their mis-
sion to assist unemployed individuals
as soon as possible to get people back
to work.
I know, in my district, case managers
at the Workforce Centers of South Cen-
tral Kansas provide a critical service
connecting people with jobs or skills
training to further their careers.
At a time when our economy is grow-
ing at historic rates and we have more
job openings than ever before, the work
these centers provide is extremely im-
portant to help make sure all Ameri-
cans can participate in this economic
revival.
I want to thank my fellow Ways and
Means Committee members for work-
ing to bring this bill to the floor, and
I urge my colleagues to support it.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE),
a member of our subcommittee
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
DANNY K. DAVIS).
Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely de-
lighted to rise in support of H.R. 1759,
the Building on Reemployment Im-
provements to Deliver Good Employ-
ment for Workers Act, also known as
the BRIDGE for Workers Act.
I do want to congratulate the authors
of this bill, Mrs. WALORSKI and my col-
league Mrs. MURPHY, for their effort in
putting this forward.
This bill aims to provide workers re-
ceiving unemployment benefits the
support they need to not only get back
into the workforce as soon as possible,
but to prevent them from being unem-
ployed in the first place.
This legislation is so important be-
cause it would extend reemployment
services and eligibility assessments to
all claimants of unemployment bene-
fits, rather than limiting these benefits
to only those who are expected to run
out of benefits. Helping all unemploy-
ment insurance claimants reenter the
workforce is vital for a robust economy
that will only thrive with a skilled
workforce.
Mr. Speaker, research shows that the
longer workers are out of work, the
harder it can be to maintain their
skills. Reemployment services equip
workers with important tools, such as
individualized career counseling and
job search assistance, to find a job well
matched to their skills and experience
more quickly. This helps to stabilize
families’ income.
These are the kinds of services that
we need to invest in as a nation, espe-
cially since we know that not all boats
are rising in this economy.

ing to the Department of Workforce

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3151
April 9, 2019
Development’s Reemployment Services
Program was bolstered for fiscal year
2019, with an increase of nearly $722,000.
Already, we have seen improvements in
the program’s effectiveness for Wiscon-
sinites in need of just a little bit of
extra assistance with finding suitable
employment.
Mr. Speaker, I would also note that
the BRIDGE for Workers Act was a bi-
partisan effort, so important for get-
ting things done. We are pleased with
the overwhelming cooperation on both
sides of the aisle, and I urge my col-
leagues to support its passage.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, hav-
ing no other speakers, I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, may I inquire as to how much
time I have remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 9 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New Mexico (Ms.
TORRES SMALL), a cosponsor of this
bill.
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my
full support for H.R. 1759, the BRIDGE
for Workers Act, led by Representa-
tives Murphy, Walorski, LaHood, and
myself.
Mr. Speaker, my State of New Mex-
ico continues to suffer from one of the
highest unemployment rates in the
country. In one county in my district,
the unemployment rate is 17 percent.
As lawmakers, we must prioritize
policies that will help counties across
the Nation like Luna County combat
systemic problems that are preventing
a swift return to the workforce.
Research shows that the longer
workers are out of work, the harder it
can be to maintain their skills and the
more likely workers will fall out of the
labor force entirely.
When I was in college, my dad lost
his job to funding cuts. My parents and
I had just taken out loans so that I
could go to college. I remember sitting
in class, worried. I was homesick, and I
felt powerless to do anything to help
my family through that difficult time.
My dad is one of the hardest working
people I know. On his own, he got the
training he needed to find a job in our
hometown, but it took years. We all
made sacrifices in the meantime.
I worked multiple jobs, and I grad-
uated in 3 years to help limit that debt,
and I took on my parents’ loan pay-
ments to help out.
Now my dad is a schoolbus driver,
and the kids he drives to school, the
colleagues he serves as a union presi-
dent, and our community are all better
because of the work that he does. I just
wish he had found his second calling
earlier.
This bill will help. The earlier we re-
train people, the earlier they find new
careers. This helps people in their most
vulnerable moments. It supports fami-
lies, and it builds stronger commu-
nities.
That is why I am proud to help lead
the BRIDGE for Workers Act, which
will help unemployed individuals find a
job faster so that they can provide for
their families and get back on their
feet as soon as possible.
This would fix a flaw in the current
law that limits reemployment services
to only those expected to remain un-
employed after their benefits run out.
Reemployment services are essential,
as they give people without a job the
tools they need to get back to work
through programs offering targeted job
search assistance, career counseling,
and interview and resume workshops.
With greater access to these services,
unemployed individuals will be more
likely to find a job faster and rejoin
the workforce.
This bill is also cost effective. Since
it allows States to use their reemploy-
ment services grants more effectively,
individuals will return to work
quicker, which will generate more sav-
ings for our government.
When Americans who want to work
hard get the support they need to do
just that, we all succeed. I encourage
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle
to support this legislation and help un-
employed Americans across our Nation
get back on their feet.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, hav-
ing no other speakers, I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL).
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I am proud to stand as a member of
this subcommittee to support the
BRIDGE for Workers Act.
Mr. Speaker, no person wants to be
without a job. I think that the hardest
and most important thing that we as
Members of Congress can do is to sup-
port the American worker to not only
stay employed and find jobs, but, when
they have to lose their job, that they
are helped to be retrained—and that is
exactly what this bill will do.
This bill will provide better reem-
ployment services. Right now, they are
limited. By expanding it, we will help
American workers who are unemployed
get back to work quicker and faster.
I want to acknowledge that this is a
bipartisan bill. It is exactly what the
American people need to see us do,
which is to help workers maintain
their dignity by not only staying em-
ployed but, when they lose their job,
getting reemployed.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion and want to thank the chairman
of our subcommittee and the ranking
member of our subcommittee for bring-
ing this bipartisan bill to the floor.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I have
no other speakers. I am prepared to
close, and I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Mr. Speaker, as you have heard
today, the ability to pair benefits with
services can have a profound effect on
the lives of workers and their families.
At a time with more than a million
more jobs than we actually have unem-
ployed, this effort is especially critical.
This bill gives States the flexibility
they need to make reemployment serv-
ices a great success.
Again, I urge support of H.R. 1759,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Mr. Speaker, I came to this session
with the simple notion of coming to do
a job and to go do my work. Listening
to my colleagues’ representations and
their articulation of experiences and
what this bill really means, I am re-
newed, and I am delighted because it is
an important bill, seriously important.
Yes, in many places the economy is
good; people are able to work. But
bridges connect and transport, and this
bridge connects people to the oppor-
tunity to get a job, to go back to work,
to be able to take care of their fami-
lies, to have money so that their chil-
dren can go to college or they can sus-
tain themselves while their daughter is
completing her education.
b 1345
Mr. Speaker, I commend my col-
leagues, Mrs. MURPHY and Ms. TORRES
SMALL; the ranking member of the sub-
committee, Mrs. WALORSKI; and Mr.
LAHOOD, my colleague from Illinois,
for their ingenuity, creativity, and for
the introduction of this tremendous
piece of legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
DANNY K. DAVIS) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R.
1759, as amended.
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-

TITLE IV—BUDGETARY EFFECTS
SEC. 4001. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the
purpose of complying with the Statutory
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in

the House Budget Committee, provided that
such statement has been submitted prior to
the vote on passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. LEWIS) and the gentleman
from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Georgia.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
1957, as amended, the Taxpayer First
Act of 2019.
I would like to begin by thanking my
good friend, the gentlewoman from
New York (Mrs. LOWEY), who is the
chair of the Appropriations Committee
for her support and helping move this
important bill.
Mr. Speaker, this is not a Republican
or a Democratic bill. It is an American
one. I am proud of the process and the
product. I also want to thank Chair-
man NEAL and Ranking Member
BRADY; the Oversight Subcommittee
Ranking Member KELLY, my good
friend; and all members of the Sub-
committee on Oversight for joining me
on this bill.
I also would like to thank our former
subcommittee chairs, the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. BUCHANAN) and our
former colleague from Kansas, Ms. Jen-
kins, for their great work.
In addition, I am pleased that Chair-
man GRASSLEY, and Ranking Member
WYDEN introduced a companion bill in
the Senate.
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to con-
gratulate all of the House Members and
Senators who have bills and ideas that
are included in this bill.
Mr. Speaker, as you well know, and
as I know, and as other members of the
committee know, this is a good bill. It
is a necessary bill to do what is right
and what is fair.
In particular, I would like to thank
our staff, Karen, Rachel, Susan, Isa-
bella, Zach, Lindsay, Jason, Lori, Mi-
chael, and Jamila. They worked so
hard on this important bill, and I have
faith that this time we will cross the
finish line. We have been trying for
years. Three times this bill passed the
House. These individuals worked so
hard on this important bill, and I have
faith that this time we will do more
than just cross the finish line.
For many years, the Oversight Sub-
committee worked in a bipartisan
manner to improve the IRS. This bill is
the result of many hearings, thought-
ful oversight, and help from stake-
holders. Mr. Speaker, we took our time
and we did it right.
We asked Democrat and Republican
Members to provide feedback. We
reached out to taxpayers and advo-
cates. We asked questions and listened
to the response. We listened to the an-
swers. We learned that we all share the
common goal of finding ways to help
American taxpayers, and there is no
time like the present.
Mr. Speaker, this is the season when
millions of Americans are working
around the clock to file their taxes by
April 15. I am proud that this Congress
will respond to their concerns with this
bill to improve taxpayer services, pro-
tect taxpayers during enforcement, and
strengthen the appeals process.
Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayer First Act
contains many commonsense policies
to achieve these goals. For example,
the bill provides for matching grants
for the Volunteer Income Tax Assist-
ance program which help low-income
and moderate-income taxpayers com-
plete and file their taxes.
This bill also protects low-income
taxpayers and people who receive So-
cial Security disability insurance, ben-
efits from the private debt collection
program.
Above all, the Taxpayer First Act
serves as an example of the good and
thoughtful policy that Congress can
produce when both the process and the
product are bipartisan.
Mr. Speaker, with this bill, we show
taxpayers and IRS public servants that
their frustration does not fall on deaf
ears, blind eyes, and hard hearts.
With this bill, Congress heard their
concerns and responded to their calls,
to their cries for action, and we did
act.
Mr. Speaker, this bill should be an
inspiration to us all. I urge all of my
colleagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

Sincerely,
RICHARD E. NEAL,
Chairman.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, today exemplifies what
this body is supposed to be about, the
people’s House acting in the best inter-
est of the people. Republicans and
Democrats have come together to pass
the Taxpayer First Act, landmark leg-
islation to reform the IRS so it better
works for every single American.
I am honored to have coauthored this
bill with my good friend, the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS). I
thank the gentleman for his commit-
ment to the taxpayers and for working
with me on a great achievement for the
American people.
We all work for the American people,
whether you are sitting in this House,
or whether you are a member of some
agency. And we look at the 80,000 em-
ployees at the IRS, and we know that
they work with an $11 billion budget
which is supplied by hardworking
American taxpayers. It should work in
their best interest.
Over the last 2 years, the Ways and
Means Committee and various sub-
committees held hearings and other
events to discover what is working, and
what isn’t. As we looked at redesigning
the IRS, we focused on improving the
relationship between our taxpayers and
our government.
Both sides agree that the IRS should
prioritize taxpayers’ rights and that it
should be a resource and not an adver-
sary to the American people.
This bill will achieve those goals.
Americans will interact with an IRS
that carries out customer service like
we do in the private sector; improved
support with services online, in person
and on the phone will finally become a
reality.
Gone are those days when you would
walk into a business and there would
be a complaint department. Instead, it
has been replaced by customer service.
The IRS is going to be a customer serv-
ice agency. Let’s look at what this leg-
islation will do.
First, to achieve the mission outlined
above, the agency’s quality service
motto will no longer just be a motto
that rings hollow. The bill requires the
IRS to adopt commonsense, private-
sector-like customer service standards;
things as simple as a callback option so
Americans aren’t stuck on hold for
hours on end.
Secondly, we are overhauling the
IRS’ enforcement tools so families and
small businesses don’t have property
unfairly seized. The Constitution guar-
antees all Americans the right to due
process and protection from unreason-
able searches and seizures. Our legisla-
tion prevents outrageous enforcement
abuses to protect taxpayers from un-
fair seizures.
Third, the Taxpayer First Act recasts
the IRS as our tax administrator rath-
er than simply an enforcement agency.
It is more than a semantic difference.
It would change the culture at the
agency for the better.
Another way it will protect tax-
payers is by creating an independent
appeals office. This will give taxpayers
a fair and impartial review of disputes
they may have with the IRS.
We also took note of the fact that it
shouldn’t take a Freedom of Informa-
tion Act request to see what evidence
the IRS is using against taxpayers in
those disputes. This legislation will
make sure you can see your individual
case file when resolving a dispute with
the agency.
Lastly, we are revamping the IRS’
outdated and ancient technology which
will better position the agency to
proactively combat cyber threats. IRS
employees are forced to use technology
that is outrageously outdated; some of
it dates back to the 1960s.
This bill provides accountability to
the IRS for the billions in funding it is
given for IT each year. That account-
ability extends to protections against
cyber threats. We must ensure that
taxpayer information is safe and that
refunds are not at risk to thieves. This
legislation strengthens the IRS’ part-
nership with States and the private
sector to combat those threats.
Taken together, these reforms will
greatly benefit Americans each year
during tax season and end disputes
with the IRS.
Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1957, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS).
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I want to commend Chairman
LEWIS and Ranking Member KELLY for
their tremendous work on this bill.
I feel like today might be one of my
best days in Congress, because I had
the opportunity a moment ago to talk
about helping individuals who are un-
employed.
Now, we are talking about helping in-
dividuals with their income tax prepa-
ration, individuals who might be low
income; individuals who have difficulty
reading and writing and understanding;
individuals who are disabled; individ-
uals who are poverty stricken, people
who make less than 250 percent of what
is known as the poverty level in this
country.
b 1400
I feel good because I have spent much
of the day talking about helping those
individuals in our country and in our
society who need help the most. It is a
great bill, and I am proud to support it.
I thank all of those operations in
Chicago, the Center for Economic
Progress, the City-Wide Tax Assistance
Program via Ladder Up, the United
Way, and all the rest of those agencies
in the city of Chicago that are helping
low-income people with their income
tax.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. RICE).
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, as a former tax lawyer and
CPA, I have seen too often the detri-
mental effect of substandard tech-
nology at the IRS and substandard cus-
tomer service.
I stand in support today of the Tax-
payer First Act. Since the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act became the law of the
land, our economic potential has been
unleashed, and America is, once again,
the land of opportunity. When we
passed the tax reform package, our
message was clear: We won’t wait an-
other 30 years to take up tax legisla-
tion. We will consistently work to im-
prove the system for American tax-
payers.
In order for any company to be suc-
cessful, it needs modern technology
that supports its customer service mis-
sion. The IRS, whose customers are 140
million Americans, should be no excep-
tion.
Filing taxes should be straight-
forward and simple, and taxpayers
should be treated fairly and with re-
spect by the IRS. However, that is not
how the majority of Americans de-
scribe their experience with the agen-
cy. This legislation will require the

IRS to modernize their ancient tech-
nology and will address many of the
issues American taxpayers face when
dealing with our Nation’s tax collector.
Included in this package is my bill,
the Electronic Signature Standards
Act, which requires the IRS to imple-
ment uniform standards to accept elec-
tronic signatures. This is a simple, free
way for small businesses and individual
taxpayers to comply with system re-
quirements. Providing uniform guid-
ance for e-signatures will simplify the
filing process for taxpayers who depend
on this commonly used technology and
enable the IRS to move forward with a
secure filing option they already sup-
port.
In conjunction with other legislation
in this reform package, the Electronic
Signature Standards Act will bring the
IRS into the 21st century so that it can
serve hardworking American taxpayers
better.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues
to support this legislation and take
this opportunity to return the IRS to
its taxpayer first mission.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from the
great State of Alabama (Ms. SEWELL).
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, as we approach tax day, I am proud
to support the passage of the Taxpayer
First Act, a commonsense, bipartisan
piece of legislation to improve the rela-
tionship between taxpayers and the
IRS.
Tax season is often confusing and
overly burdensome for millions of fam-
ilies and small business owners across
this country as people spend countless
hours struggling to correctly file their
taxes. Outdated IRS systems and prac-
tices contribute to this confusion and
jeopardize the security of taxpayers’
personal information. Additionally, too
many taxpayers don’t have reliable ac-
cess to customer service supports and
timely dispute resolution.
The Taxpayer First Act includes a
number of important provisions to ad-
dress these challenges, expanding tax-
payer assistance services and improv-
ing data security. Families in my Ala-
bama district and across this country
will benefit from this bill codifying the
Free File program, shielding certain
low-income households from private
debt collectors, and making more re-
sources available online.
I am proud that the Taxpayer First
Act also includes a provision that I had
in my bill that I introduced with a Re-
publican colleague, JASON SMITH, the
Preserving Taxpayers’ Rights Act. This
provision establishes an independent
office of appeals within the IRS and
gives taxpayers a legal right to impar-
tial, timely, and efficient dispute reso-
lution. It also helps protect taxpayers
by clarifying the limited scope of cases
that can be litigated and prevents the
IRS from outsourcing audits of private
taxpayers to outside law firms.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman
LEWIS and Congressman KELLY for
their continued support and leadership
on this legislation. I know this legisla-
tion has been introduced and passed
the House three times, but I know that
Congressman LEWIS knows that when
you are right, and you are fighting on
behalf of the American people for what
is right, you must persist and keep
fighting to get to the finish line. It is
called good trouble, according to Con-
gressman LEWIS, and we are getting
into good trouble today by helping to
make the tax filing process more effi-
cient, fair, and secure for the American
people.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this commonsense, bipartisan
legislation.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD).
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in strong support of H.R. 1957,
the Taxpayer First Act. I thank Chair-
man LEWIS and Ranking Member
KELLY for their hard work on the Ways
and Means Subcommittee on Oversight
and for introducing this important
piece of legislation to modernize and
improve the Internal Revenue Service.
Since last Congress, our committee
has focused on finding legislative solu-
tions to make needed changes at the
IRS. Dealing with the IRS can be frus-
trating, and ensuring an efficient and
transparent IRS is key to restoring the
relationship between taxpayers and the
agency, as well as effective implemen-
tation of our Tax Code.
I am pleased that a bill I introduced
with a Democratic colleague, Congress-
man TOM SUOZZI, H.R. 1825, the Improv-
ing Assistance for Taxpayers Act, is in-
cluded in this bill. Currently, the Of-
fice of the Taxpayer Advocate located
within the IRS represents taxpayer in-
terests and helps address both indi-
vidual and systemic issues at the agen-
cy. When it comes to addressing sys-
temic issues, the taxpayer advocate
can issue what is called a taxpayer ad-
vocate directive. Unfortunately, these
orders are not always responded to in a
detailed or timely manner.
Our bill aims to improve the process.
Specifically, the IRS would be required
to respond to taxpayer advocate direc-
tives within 90 days. We also establish
an appeals process, when the advocate
deems necessary. If detailed and timely
responses are not provided, then the
taxpayer advocate must report such in-
stances to Congress.
This bill empowers taxpayers across
the country by improving transparency
and ensuring substantive and timely
answers for taxpayers dealing with an
issue at the IRS while improving con-
gressional oversight.
Our constituents sent us to Wash-
ington to make government more ef-
fective, efficient, and accountable.
These reforms included in my bill and
the Taxpayer First Act will do exactly
that. This package passed the House
last Congress, and I hope to receive the
same support from my colleagues
today.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JUDY CHU).
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise in strong support of the
Taxpayer First Act, the first package
of IRS reforms that Congress has con-
sidered since 1998.
This bipartisan bill takes broad steps
to improve the taxpayer experience by
making the filing process easier and
more efficient. It also strengthens the
IRS’ ability to combat identity theft
and refund fraud. These are issues that
create worry and stress for our con-
stituents, and I am proud that we are
acting swiftly to bring relief.
This bill also tamps down on the pro-
gram that allows the IRS to outsource
debt collection to private contractors.
These contractors often use many ag-
gressive tactics to pressure the poorest
and most vulnerable among us, forcing
them to make payments even if they
can’t afford it. This creates economic
hardship for families who would other-
wise qualify for alternative payment
plans by the IRS. What is worse, it
costs the U.S. Treasury more than the
money it brings in. I believe it should
be abolished for good, but this bill
reaches a strong compromise to ensure
the poorest are no longer targeted.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP).
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the Subcommittee on Oversight
chairman, Mr. LEWIS, and the ranking
member, Mr. KELLY, for getting this
bill to the floor today. This legislation
is the product of years of work, and I
am glad to see these commonsense pro-
visions get one step closer to the finish
line.
Congress hasn’t tackled real IRS re-
form in decades. With a bipartisan, bi-
cameral effort, our goal is to modernize
the IRS and improve the taxpayer ex-
perience. With sensible reforms, the
Taxpayer First Act redesigns the IRS
with that mission at the forefront—
putting the taxpayer first.
I would also like to highlight that
this bill includes a provision to codify
the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance,
or VITA, matching grant program and
make it permanent. My colleague, Dr.
Davis from Illinois, and I have intro-
duced legislation to make VITA perma-
nent, and I am pleased to see the provi-
sions included in the bill before us
today.
VITA centers provide free tax help by
many volunteers to low-income indi-
viduals, persons with disabilities, and
limited English-speaking taxpayers
who need assistance with their taxes.
These centers, and the many volun-
teers who operate them, assist thou-
sands of our constituents every year.
By making this program permanent,
we will provide VITA organizations,
volunteers, and the taxpayers they
serve with certainty.
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see this
provision included and this bill on the

floor today, and I urge its swift pas-
sage.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Wis-
consin (Ms. MOORE).
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I am such
a proud cosponsor of the Taxpayer
First Act, and I stand with my col-
leagues as we vote on this bipartisan,
bicameral bill.
I am going to quickly address two
key provisions of this bill.
First, this bill is an important step
that Congress is taking toward reform-
ing the IRS for the first time in 20
years to better serve taxpayers and to
strengthen taxpayer protections that
have been long overdue. This whole-
scale modernization is an important
step toward restoring confidence and
trust in this crucial Federal agency.
Secondly, with the aim of encour-
aging sensible enforcement, this act
modifies the IRS private debt collec-
tion program to stop the targeting of
lower income Americans by creating
two additional categories of cases not
eligible for referral to private collec-
tion agencies: taxpayers whose income
is substantially derived from Supple-
mental Security Income benefits or
disability insurance benefits payments,
or taxpayers with an adjusted gross in-
come of 200 percent of the poverty level
and below.
For years, experts have told Congress
that private debt collection has hurt
the most vulnerable among us. Today,
we are providing safeguards to protect
against businesses profiting by col-
lecting from financially vulnerable
taxpayers.
Mr. Speaker, I urge immediate pas-
sage of this important legislation, and
I urge all Members to support it.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES).
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my
friend, Representative KELLY, for
bringing this to the floor.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1957, the Taxpayer First Act.
This bipartisan bill redesigns and mod-
ernizes the IRS for the first time in 21
years and focuses on improving the
agency’s service to taxpayers.
As the only former State treasurer in
the House, I understand the need for
the country’s tax administration agen-
cy to adopt a mission of customer serv-
ice and to help taxpayers retrieve in-
formation, resolve issues, and make
payments.
This bill accomplishes these goals in
several ways. First, it establishes an
independent appeals process so that
taxpayers are treated fairly. It pro-
vides for easier electronic submission
of tax return forms, and it strengthens
the IRS ability to combat identity
theft. It also requires the agency to
submit to Congress plans to further im-
prove efficiency and customer service.
Altogether, the Taxpayer First Act
provides needed, commonsense, and
overdue reforms to the IRS.
I thank my fellow Ways and Means
Committee members for working to
bring this bill to the floor.
Today’s vote is a culmination of sev-
eral years of work and numerous hear-
ings and discussions, including passing
this bill in the House during last Con-
gress.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support the bill.
b 1415
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. HILL).
Ms. HILL of California. Mr. Speaker,
I rise in support of H.R. 1957, the Tax-
payer First Act, which I wasn’t expect-
ing to rise in support of; but this act
improves taxpayer service, modernizes
IRS infrastructure, helps low- and mid-
dle-income taxpayers, and really cre-
ates critical reforms that my col-
leagues like the Honorable JOHN LEWIS
have been fighting to pass for years.
They have finally gotten Senate Re-
publicans to work with them and, for
the first time, could enact critical pro-
visions that will help consumers and
become law, despite a divided govern-
ment.
But that means that Senate Repub-
licans fit in some bitter pills and some
problematic provisions. One of these is
a piece that came to my attention
today—which the corporate tax lobby
has spent years and millions of dollars
to get—which would bar the IRS from
creating a simple, free filing system
that would compete with their own.
Analysis shows that, through these
corporate programs, U.S. taxpayers eli-
gible for free filing pay about $1 billion
a year in unnecessary fees.
In this freshman class, I and many of
my colleagues were sent to reject cor-
porate influence and stand up for peo-
ple. This puts us in a difficult spot.
But the rest of this bill is too impor-
tant. Champions for low-income, work-
ing people say that this is an oppor-
tunity that will not come again and
will help 150 million taxpayers. There-
fore, I support it, and, separately, I will
introduce legislation with some of my
colleagues to address the problems that
have been inserted by special interests.
We have to continue the fight to get
big money out of politics, and this is
the beginning of the fight, not the end.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS).
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I appreciate the gentleman yield-
ing.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1957, the Taxpayer First Act.
The Taxpayer First Act modernizes the
IRS and ensures that the IRS cannot
abuse its enforcement powers.
To that end, in 2013, a fellow north-
east Georgian, Andrew Clyde, experi-
enced IRS abuse in the form of civil
asset forfeiture firsthand. Andrew is a
Navy veteran who has served multiple
tours of duty, and he owns Clyde Ar-
mory in Athens, Georgia. The IRS
seized $950,000 from his bank accounts
despite no evidence of criminal activ-
ity. The IRS seized his accounts under
what is called structuring laws.
Under structuring laws, the IRS may
seize money if an individual made reg-
ular deposits or withdrawals of less
than $10,000. The law was originally in-
tended to catch those trying to conceal
a crime, but, too often, it has been used
to target innocent individuals and
small business owners.
Andrew Clyde went to court to chal-
lenge the IRS abuse and was eventually
forced to forfeit $50,000 to the IRS and
spend over $100,000 in legal fees.
Andrew Clyde’s story is, sadly, a
common one, with the IRS seizing
more than $242 million in structuring
cases from 2005 to 2012. That is why I
introduced the RESPECT Act, to stop
this practice and to protect hard-
working Americans like Andrew Clyde
from IRS overreach.
I am glad to see that the RESPECT
Act was introduced and has been in-
cluded in the Taxpayer First Act. This
legislation will rein in IRS overreach
by requiring prosecutors to dem-
onstrate probable cause that seized
funds were illegally earned or struc-
tured to conceal illegal activity. It also
enables property owners to challenge a
seizure at a postseizure hearing rather
than wait months or years to have
their case heard.
I would like to thank my friends and
my dear friend from Georgia, Congress-
man LEWIS, and also MIKE KELLY for
their work on this legislation and for
supporting the modernization of the
IRS and protecting innocent Ameri-
cans from IRS abuse.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from New
York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ).
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I
rise to speak on this bill.
First, I would like us to clarify ex-
actly some of the things that we are
able to deliver in this bill:
One is low-income taxpayer excep-
tion to the Private Debt Collection
program.
The second is that it codifies the Vol-
unteer Income Tax Assistance program
that helps low-income taxpayers pre-
pare their tax returns.
The third is that the bill allows the
IRS to refer taxpayers needing assist-
ance to low-income taxpayer clinics.
The bill also creates a single point of
contact within the IRS to identify
identity theft victims.
And, lastly, the bill allows all tax-
payers, over the next 5 years, to re-
quest an identity protection personal
identification number to use to prevent
identity theft.
So, I would like to commend all of
those positive concessions delivered to
the American people in this bill. How-
ever, I would also like to lodge some of
my concerns perhaps for us to address
in the future.
Dylan Matthews at Vox recently pub-
lished an article that said: ‘‘It is a huge
scandal that Congress has not yet in-
structed the IRS to automatically pre-
pare taxes for the vast majority of
Americans. The IRS has all the infor-
mation required to do that for all but

a few taxpayers,’’ and the main reason
it doesn’t may have to do with the role
of money in politics.
So, with this bill, I would like to
again commend the advancements that
we have made for working-class people,
but, long term, we should be looking at
a solution where everyday people do
not necessarily have to spend hours
every year preparing tax returns when
the majority of Americans have rel-
atively simple and straightforward re-
turns. I would like to just rise and
commend those positive contributions
and also point the way forward in the
future.
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
I thank Mr. LEWIS so much. I can’t
tell the gentleman what an honor it is
to be on the floor with him today in
the people’s House, working on legisla-
tion that benefits every single Amer-
ican, something he has done all his life.
To be here with Mr. LEWIS today and to
get this done is incredible.
It has often been said that, if you do
the right thing for the right reasons,
good things happen. Wouldn’t it be
great today if all of our colleagues
come together to do the right thing for
the right reason, for the right people:
our hardworking American taxpayers.
This is an incredible day for America
to look at the people’s House and say
this was a day when both Democrats
and Republicans came together to do
the right thing at the right time, for
the right people.
It has been an incredible honor, and I
want to thank the staff. As we know, it
is the staff that does so much work and
puts in hour after hour after hour to
make this a success. I can’t thank
them all enough for what they have all
done. It has been incredible work. It
was done not just in the best interest
of the Congressperson for whom they
work because, more importantly, they
work for the American people.
It is always great being with Mr.
LEWIS, especially on a day like this. It
has been an incredible day for the
American people, to prove to them
that, in Washington, D.C., the people’s
House is doing that, working together
for them, bringing us together as a
body, a legislative body, something
that they have been looking for and
looking to and saying: Why can’t you
all just get together and do the right
thing? Today is the day that that is
going to happen.
I thank Mr. LEWIS so much for work-
ing with us and getting this done, and,
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
I want to thank Mr. KELLY—my
friend, my brother—for all of his help,
all of his support. Working together,
Democrats and Republicans, we can get
some things done. It has been a pleas-
ure to work with the gentleman on this
bill.
Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayer First Act
is a bipartisan bill in both the House
and the Senate. The bill will improve
the Internal Revenue Service and help
our taxpayers.
Again, I want to thank my friend, the
gentleman from Pennsylvania, for
working with me on this bill. And he is
a good friend. We have traveled to-
gether from Washington, D.C., to the
heart of the Deep South with his
grandson and several Members of Con-
gress. Again, I want to thank him and
ask him to tell his grandson I said hi.
Mr. Speaker, this bill is a product of
more than 14 hearings and a number of
roundtables over the past 3 years in the
Subcommittee on Oversight. It is a
good and thoughtful policy. I urge all
of my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle to support the Taxpayer First
Act.
I want to thank all of the staff, each
and every one of them, on both sides of
the aisle, for helping us. Without their
help and without their support, we
would not be here. Again, I say thank
you.
Mr. Speaker, again, I say thank you
to my friend and my brother, Mr.
KELLY, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CARSON of Indiana). The question is on
the motion offered by the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS) that the
House suspend the rules and pass the
bill, H.R. 1957, as amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 1644) to
restore the open internet order of the
Federal Communications Commission,
with Mr. CARSON of Indiana in the
chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member on
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania
(Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE), my good
friend from the East Coast, and the
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN),
my other good friend, each will control
30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Pennsylvania.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 3 min-
utes.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of
H.R. 1644, the Save the Internet Act.
This bill comes to the floor after
more than 18 hours of consideration by
the Energy and Commerce Committee
over the course of hearings and mark-
ups since the start of this Congress.
During that time, we have heard
from consumer advocates, minority
and underrepresented communities,
rural broadband providers, small busi-
nesses, innovators, entrepreneurs, and
millions of constituents, all calling for
the restoration of net neutrality rules.
In addition, polls show that more
than 86 percent of all Americans,
whether they be Republicans, Inde-
pendents, or Democrats, opposed the
Trump FCC’s repeal of the protections
that this bill reinstates.
People around the country care deep-
ly about a free and open internet be-
cause it is critical for so many commu-
nities and sectors of our economy.
This legislation will do three things:
First, it restores bipartisan, com-
monsense net neutrality protections
and puts a cop back on the beat to pro-
tect consumers, small businesses, and
competitors from unjust, unreasonable,
and discriminatory practices by inter-
net service providers.
Second, this bill gives the FCC the
authority to protect consumers, now
and in the future, through forward-
looking regulatory authority.
Third, the bill restores the FCC’s
legal authority to support broadband
access and deployment programs
through the Universal Service Fund.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3170 April 9, 2019
These programs pay for the deploy-
ment of broadband in rural commu-
nities through the Connect America
Fund and support access for low-in-
come families, seniors, and veterans
through the Lifeline program.
The Save the Internet Act codifies
the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order and
permanently prohibits the FCC from
applying provisions on rate setting,
unbundling of ISP networks, or levying
additional taxes or fees on broadband
access.
This legislation that we are consid-
ering here today charts a new course
for net neutrality and would put in
place 21st century rules for a 21st cen-
tury internet.
I look forward to advancing this leg-
islation out of the House and, ulti-
mately, through the Congress so that
we can restore these essential protec-
tions for all Americans.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, Republicans and Demo-
crats can agree more than they dis-
agree on the issue of net neutrality pa-
rameters to protect a free and open
internet for consumers.
The net neutrality bright line rules
Republicans support are simple, and
they are actually pretty easy to under-
stand, Mr. Chairman: no blocking, no
throttling, no paid prioritization—pe-
riod. And no government takeover of
the internet by Washington bureau-
crats.
Unfortunately, for the last few years,
Democrats have caved in to the idea
that only putting unelected bureau-
crats in charge of every facet of the
internet is the answer. And they know
what all Americans know: The bill be-
fore us today is opposed by the Presi-
dent, and the leader of the Senate says
it is dead on arrival there, so it will
not become law. This is the end of its
journey.
They also know the internet grew up
under very light-touch regulation,
which Republicans favor and which
even President Clinton favored. That is
what allowed the bright innovators in
our Nation’s Silicon Valley and across
the world to experiment and to invent
the great services we all enjoy today.
You see, they did not have to come to
Washington, D.C., to some agency and
get a permit or permission first. They
didn’t have to get second-guessed later,
either.
Unfortunately, the regime that my
friends across the aisle seek to saddle
the internet with was only in place for
less than 2 years. Less than 2 years,
that is it.
Some argue that during that period,
investment broadband build-out actu-
ally declined. We had testimony at the
Energy and Commerce Committee from
an internet service provider in rural
Oregon who spoke to that very fact.
This bill, called Save the Internet
Act, is another plank in their socialist
agenda that would regulate the inter-
net as if it were a monopoly utility
under the title II section of the Com-
munications Act of 1934. That is the
law originally used to govern monopoly
telephone companies in the 1930s.
This legislation imposes that heavy
hand of Washington’s regulatory bu-
reaucracy over the single most vibrant
and important driver of the economic
growth in America and the world: job
creation, better quality of life, infor-
mation sharing. We call that the open
internet that we enjoy today.
I would admit, no one fully under-
stands the implications of this legisla-
tion, the scope of what it entails, and
the impact it could have on consumers.
There is much debate on this point in
the committee.
Does this bill empower the FCC to
dictate where and when new broadband
networks can or must be deployed? We
think it could.
Will this bill provide the authority
for a government takeover and man-
agement of private networks? We think
it could.
Would this bill allow government
taxation of the internet? It could.
Could it lead to government regula-
tion of speech on the internet? Yep.
And will this legislation limit the
full potential of 5G and impede the de-
velopment of the next wave of innova-
tion in internet services? Most outside
experts think it could.
So Republicans attempted to get to
the bottom of these questions through
our hearings and our markups. The an-
swer to all of these questions was, re-
grettably, yes.
Now, we offered amendments, Mr.
Chairman, at the full committee to
close the doors to these and other pow-
ers that are granted to the Federal
Communications Commission under
this bill, powers that are completely
unrelated to net neutrality. Every one
of those amendments was rejected.
Supporters claim the bill locks into
law more than 700 instances where the
Federal Communications Commission
forbore from taking action under title
II, but supporters cannot provide Mem-
bers of Congress with a list of those 700
forbearances—nope. We have asked; no
list. The Democrats won’t or can’t even
tell us precisely what they are putting
into law if we can’t see that list.
But we even offered an amendment to
truly lock in this forbearance and pre-
vent the FCC from imposing similar
regulations in the future or through
other provisions in statute, and that,
too, was rejected.
We offered an amendment protecting
the next generation of wireless net-
works, 5G, from the incompatible regu-
latory regime. That, too, was rejected
on party-line votes.
So, disappointingly, the Democrats
went back on an agreement I helped
negotiate in each of the last two Con-
gresses to relieve some of our rural
internet providers from some of the
most burdensome reporting require-
ments of the FCC’s 2015 order.
Twice we passed that relief, and we
did so unanimously in this House, and
it was bipartisan, obviously. They
more than cut the relief in half, put-
ting costly bureaucratic reporting re-
quirements ahead of small internet
service providers investing in con-
necting Americans to high-speed inter-
net services.
It doesn’t have to be this way. It
should not be this way. Republicans
have put forth serious proposals. We
put forth a menu of options as a start-
ing point for true bipartisan net neu-
trality legislation.
I have introduced a bill that codifies
the FCC’s bright-line rules prohibiting
blocking and throttling and paid
prioritization for internet traffic, and
that would require that ISPs, internet
service providers, be transparent in
their network management practices
and prices.
Two of my Republican colleagues on
the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee have introduced legislation that
should also gain Democratic support.
Representative BOB LATTA, who is
our top Republican on the sub-
committee, has legislation drawn from
a proposal introduced in 2010 by the
previous Democratic chairman of the
full Energy and Commerce Committee,
Henry Waxman of California.
If Democrats don’t believe Mr. Wax-
man’s plan is a good starting point,
then Representative CATHY MCMORRIS
RODGERS has introduced legislation
that is drawn directly from a bill that
passed in Washington State’s Demo-
cratic-controlled legislature and was
signed into law in 2018 by a Democratic
Governor.
So what do all three of these pro-
posals have in common? They are root-
ed in the shared principles of net neu-
trality that will protect consumers,
but without putting unelected bureau-
crats in control of the internet.
So I remain committed to a bipar-
tisan solution, to preserving a free and
open internet. I actually believe it is
achievable, and I want to express to my
friends on the other side of the aisle—
and they are my friends—that our work
and our efforts together are genuine
and have been made in good faith.
The fact is we can permanently ad-
dress blocking, throttling, and paid
prioritization. We could do so in a bi-
partisan way, and we all believe in
open and free internet. We believe in
net neutrality.
But net neutrality is not title II,
near limitless government manage-
ment of the internet. Net neutrality
does not need the harmful, heavy-hand-
ed approach of title II. Net neutrality
does not require a government take-
over of the internet.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Chair, what my friend refers
to as a takeover of the internet we call
protecting consumers, and that is what
we are asking the FCC to do.
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), chair-
man of the full Energy and Commerce
Committee.

April 9, 2019
b 1530
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the chairman of our Sub-
committee on Communications and
Technology for all the work that he
has done on this net neutrality legisla-
tion.
We are here today to debate and vote
on a bill that will keep the internet
free and open. That sounds like a big
deal, and it is a big deal.
The Save the Internet Act ensures
that consumers, rather than internet
service providers, have control over
their internet experience. This is just
common sense. Each of us should be
able to decide what videos we watch,
which sites we read, and which services
we use. Nobody should be able to influ-
ence that choice—not the government
and not the large companies that run
the networks.
This legislation not only protects
consumers from large corporations, but
it also strengthens our economy by
promoting innovation and small busi-
nesses. Net neutrality ensures that any
business, no matter how small, gets the
same internet at the same speeds as
giant corporate interests. That is only
fair. There should not be favorites.
H.R. 1644 will return strong net neu-
trality protections to the internet. For
over a decade, both Republican and
Democratic FCCs restricted ISPs’ abil-
ity to control consumer access to the
internet and undermine small busi-
nesses’ ability to compete. The Trump
FCC affirmatively gave up that author-
ity in 2017, choosing the big companies
over the people.
The bill before us would return the
FCC to its traditional role of over-
seeing the Nation’s channels of com-
munications. This is a carefully crafted
bill that balances the need to put a cop
on the beat without weighing down the
industry. We are preventing blocking,
throttling, and paid prioritization, and
we are giving the FCC the authority to
stop harmful practices in the future
that are unjust or unreasonable.
The American people, Mr. Chairman,
both Democrats and Republicans, over-
whelmingly support restoring net neu-
trality. That makes sense. We all want
to control our own internet experience.
Again, I thank Chairman DOYLE for
his leadership. Let me also take a mo-
ment to recognize the hard work of the
committee staff, Alex Hoehn-Saric,
Jerry Leverich, Jennifer Epperson, AJ
Brown, Dan Miller, and Phil Murphy.
I strongly urge all my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Save the Internet
Act.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, it is
my honor to yield 5 minutes to the
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCA-
LISE), the Republican whip of the House
and a terrific member of our Energy
and Commerce Committee.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman from Oregon for yield-
ing.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to
this bill that would create a govern-
ment takeover of the internet.
If you look at the bill, first of all, it
is always interesting to pay attention
to the titles of bills—the Save the
Internet Act. Whom do you want to
save the internet from? Many would
say they want to save it from the
heavy hand of government.
I have asked my friends on the other
side of the aisle to please show me
what is so broken about the internet
that the Federal Government needs to
come in to save it.
First of all, if you look at the growth
of this great industry, this is one of
America’s greatest exports. It is one of
America’s greatest economic drivers.
Some of the best jobs in America are
created from the technology industry
that has boomed and thrived because of
the growth of the internet.
How has this internet grown? It has
grown because there is no heavy hand
of the Federal Government slowing it
down. If you go back to look, as the
internet continued to grow, as applica-
tions continued to get developed on all
kinds of devices, small handheld de-
vices, the things that people are able to
do, the improvements in their daily
lives, because of the growth of the
internet, the private money that has
come in, billions of dollars of private
money has come in to help develop this
great superhighway. It has come in, in
large part, because the Federal Govern-
ment hasn’t figured out how to regu-
late and slow it down.
Then along comes this bill. Let’s be
keenly aware of what this bill is trying
to do. The bill actually imposes what is
called title II regulations of the inter-
net. What are title II regulations?
These are laws that were created in the
1930s when there was a monopoly tele-
phone company.
You would have to google it these
days because most people might not re-
member, but they used to have these
little plugs that they would push in
and pull out. You would literally pick
up a telephone that was plugged into a
wall back then—it wasn’t a remote de-
vice—and you would call an operator
and the operator would patch you
through.
That was the series of laws that they
are now trying to apply to the inter-
net. Can you imagine these archaic
1930s laws being forced upon the inter-
net that is growing so robustly that we
are the envy of the world? Our tech-
nology, American technology, is domi-
nant in this industry because the gov-
ernment doesn’t have these heavy-
handed regulations.
Then along comes this bill, the Save
the Internet Act, to save us from this
growth, to save us from this job cre-
ation. I think people can clearly see
what is going on here. This is a battle
we are having on a lot of fronts. It is a
battle of individual freedom versus
government control.
Should you have the choice to decide
which provider you want to get your
internet service from? The great thing
about the internet today is there are so
many different people competing for
your business, and they are spending
billions of dollars to do it.
Take a look at 5G. Maybe you are on
a 3G network or a 4G network, and now
all of these private companies are
spending their own money, billions of
dollars, to build out a 5G network.
Mr. Chairman, what we would like to
see is more of this competition. Yet if
you go back to look when the Federal
Government did try this—because this
isn’t some newly created idea. Back in
2015, when there was a different admin-
istration in the White House, a dif-
ferent FCC, the FCC started to impose
these kinds of regulations and limit
the growth of the internet. What hap-
pened during that period in 2015? You
saw a dramatic drop. Over $3 billion of
investment went away. Private money
that used to come in to grow and ex-
pand these networks, 3G, 4G, hopefully
5G, when the government started to
impose these kinds of regulations, peo-
ple stopped investing because they said
the Federal Government telling them
how to spend their private money so
that we can have a better, faster inter-
net, they weren’t going to do it.
If you look at what this bill doesn’t
do, that is the really interesting part.
When they talk about the people who
are limiting content and closing off
lanes to the superhighway, it is not
those service providers. It is the edge
providers.
These big companies that are the ap-
plication developers that actually do
control your data, they are not part of
this bill. They were exempt from this
bill.
So the thing that we want to do and
see is a freer, more open internet,
which we have already. The govern-
ment is not regulating the internet
today, and it is growing and expanding
to the point where we are the envy of
the world. We have some of the best job
creation in this industry. We don’t
need the Federal Government to come
in and save us from this great growth
and expansion.
Let’s let the internet stay free and
open like it is today without the heavy
hand of the Federal Government.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself
such time as I may consume.
I find this pretty humorous that the
Republicans want to talk about gov-
ernment takeover of the internet. The
only person I know who has proposed
publicly to take over the internet is
the President of the United States
when he said he wants to nationalize
5G.
Maybe you guys need to take a little
trip over to the White House and pre-
vent that little government takeover
of the internet.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
ESHOO), a valuable member of this com-
mittee.
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the distinguished chairman of the sub-
committee for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3172 April 9, 2019
First, I include in the RECORD a let-
ter from the County of Santa Clara,
California, relative to the issue of net
neutrality and the underlying legisla-
tion.
COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA,
OFFICE OF THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE,
San Jose, CA, April 4, 2019.
Hon. ANNA ESHOO,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE ESHOO: The County
of Santa Clara strongly supports H.R. 1644,
the ‘‘Save the Internet Act of 2019.’’ This
measure would re-establish federal rules and
policies protecting net neutrality as articu-
lated by the Federal Communications Com-
mission (FCC) in its 2015 Report and Order,
In the Matter of Protecting and Promoting
the Open Internet (FCC 15–24) (the Order).
Like local governments across the coun-
try, the County of Santa Clara provides pub-
lic safety, welfare, and governance services
that depend on an open internet. For exam-
ple, County public health alert systems and
the County’s virtual emergency operations
center could both be hobbled by broadband
internet access service (BIAS) provider prac-
tices subject to regulation under the Order.
The County is deeply concerned that there
currently is no ‘‘cop on the beat’’ ensuring
the protection of such systems, and thus
strongly supports H.R. 1644, which would re-
establish oversight of BIAS provider prac-
tices that threaten public safety.
The County’s concerns are particularly
acute in light of its past experience with
BIAS provider practices. The County’s expe-
rience has demonstrated that BIAS providers
will act in their own economic interests,
even when doing so threatens public safety.
For example, shortly after the FCC revoked
net neutrality protections, Verizon throttled
Santa Clara County firefighters in the midst
of their efforts to fight the then-largest fire
in California history—despite repeated re-
quests to remove the throttling and allow
the firefights to perform their duties. These
events are outlined in the attached Declara-
tion, submitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit.
Net neutrality is also vital to the contin-
ued economic success of our region. Santa
Clara County is a world-leading hub of high-
technology innovation and development and
is home to almost 2 million residents. Net
neutrality is necessary for the prosperity of
the county’s economy, as it encourages com-
petition among businesses, fosters innova-
tion, creates jobs, and promotes economic vi-
tality both within the county and across the
nation.
Preserving net neutrality for County of
Santa Clara residents has long been an ac-
tion point for the County. In 2017, the Coun-
ty’s Board of Supervisors unanimously
adopted resolution number BOS–2017–105,
Resolution of the Board of Supervisors of the
County of Santa Clara Supporting the Pres-
ervation of Federal Rules and Policies Pro-
tecting Net Neutrality, to publicly confirm
its support of an open internet. In addition,
the County of Santa Clara and the Santa
Clara County Central Fire Protection Dis-
trict, along with the City and County of San
Francisco, California Public Utilities Com-
mission, 22 states (including California), the
District of Columbia, and several private and
nonprofit entities filed a lawsuit (Docket
181051, D.C. Cir.) challenging the FCC’s De-
cember 2017 decision to repeal net neutrality
policies with its Report and Order, In the
Matter of Restoring Internet Freedom (FCC
17–166).
By restoring the FCC’s 2015 order In the
Matter of Protecting and Promoting the
Open Internet, H.R. 1644 would ensure net
neutrality. In addition, the bill would nullify
the FCC’s 2017 order In the Matter of Restor-
ing Internet Freedom and would prohibit the
enactment of any other rule substantially
the same as this order, unless the new rule is
specifically authorized by a law enacted
after the date of the enactment of H.R. 1644.
It is for these reasons we support H.R. 1644.
On behalf of the County and its residents,
thank you for your co-sponsorship of this
important measure that will protect net neu-
trality rules and policies now and in future.
Sincerely,
JEFFREY V. SMITH, M.D., J.D.,
County Executive.

MOZILLA CORPORATION, et al., Peti-
tioners, v. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS
COMMISSION and UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA,—Respondents.
DECLARATION OF FIRE CHIEF ANTHONY BOWDEN
I, Anthony Bowden, declare:
1. I make this declaration in support of the
Brief of the County of Santa Clara (‘‘Coun-
ty’’) in the matter referenced above. I know
the facts herein of my own personal knowl-
edge and if called upon to do so, I could com-
petently testify to them under oath.
2. 1 was recently appointed the Fire Chief
for the Santa Clara County Central Fire Pro-
tection District (‘‘County Fire’’). As Fire
Chief, I also serve as Fire Marshal for Santa
Clara County and as the California Office of
Emergency Services (OES) Operational Area
Fire and Rescue Coordinator. In these roles,
I am responsible for the coordination of mu-
tual aid resources in Santa Clara County.
This includes the coordination of all fire re-
sources to significant events, such as
wildfires, throughout the State, when those
resources are requested from Santa Clara
County’s operational area. I have worked in
fire protection for more than two decades,
and in that time, I have held every rank at
County Fire.
3. Established in 1947, County Fire provides
fire services for Santa Clara County and the
County’s communities of Campbell,
Cupertino, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los
Gatos, Monte Sereno, and Saratoga. The de-
partment also provides protection for the un-
incorporated areas adjacent to those cities.
Wrapping in an approximately 20-mile arc
around the southern end of Silicon Valley,
County Fire has grown to include 15 fire sta-
tions, an administrative headquarters, a
maintenance facility, and several other sup-
port facilities, and covers 128.3 square miles.
The department employs almost three hun-
dred fire prevention, suppression, investiga-
tion, administration, and maintenance per-
sonnel; daily emergency response consists of
more than sixty employees. County Fire also
contributes resources to all-hazard response
outside Santa Clara County and around the
state. For example, County Fire has de-
ployed equipment and personnel in response
to the ongoing Mendocino Complex Fire, the
largest fire in California’s history.
4. County Fire relies upon Internet-based
systems to provide crucial and time-sen-
sitive public safety services. The Internet
has become an essential tool in providing
fire and emergency response, particularly for
events like large fires which require the
rapid deployment and organization of thou-
sands of personnel and hundreds of fire en-
gines, aircraft, and bulldozers. During these
events, resources are marshaled from across
the state and country—in some cases, even
from other countries. In these situations, a
key responsibility of emergency responders,
and of County Fire in particular, is tracking
those resources and ensuring they get to the
right place as quickly and safely as possible.
County Fire, like virtually all other emer-
gency responders, relies heavily on the Inter-
net to do both of these things.
5. As I explain below, County Fire has ex-
perienced throttling by its ISP, Verizon.
This throttling has had a significant impact
on our ability to provide emergency services.
Verizon imposed these limitations despite
being informed that throttling was actively
impeding County Fire’s ability to provide
crisis-response and essential emergency serv-
ices.
6. Only a few weeks ago, County Fire de-
ployed OES Incident Support Unit 5262
(‘‘OES 5262’’), to the Mendocino Complex
Fire, now the largest fire in state history.
OES 5262 is deployed to large incidents as a
command and control resource. Its primary
function is to track, organize, and prioritize
routing of resources from around the state
and country to the sites where they are most
needed. OES 5262 relies heavily on the use of
specialized software and Google Sheets to do
near-real-time resource tracking through the
use of cloud computing over the Internet.
7. Resources tracked across such a large
event include personnel and equipment sup-
plied from local governments across Cali-
fornia; the State of California; federal agen-
cies including the Department of Defense,
the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S.
Forest Service; and other countries. As of
Monday, August 13, 2018, the response effort
for the wildfires burning across California in-
cluded 13,000 firefighters, multiple aircraft,
dozens or hundreds of bulldozers, and hun-
dreds of fire engines. The wildfires have re-
sulted in over 726,000 acres burned and rough-
ly 2,000 structures destroyed. With several
months left in what is a ‘‘normal’’ fire sea-
son, we fully expect these numbers to rise.
8. OES 5262 also coordinates all local gov-
ernment resources deployed to the
Mendocino Complex Fire. That is, the unit
facilitates resource check-in and routing for
local government resources. In doing so, the
unit typically exchanges 5–10 gigabytes of
data per day via the Internet using a mobile
router and wireless connection. Near-real-
time information exchange is vital to proper
function. In large and complex fires, resource
allocation requires immediate information.
Dated or stale information regarding the
availability or need for resources can slow
response times and render them far less ef-
fective. Resources could be deployed to the
wrong fire, the wrong part of a fire, or fail to
be deployed at all. Even small delays in re-
sponse translate into devastating effects, in-
cluding loss of property, and, in some cases,
loss of life.
9. In the midst of our response to the
Mendocino Complex Fire, County Fire dis-
covered the data connection for OES 5262 was
being throttled by Verizon, and data rates
had been reduced to 1/200, or less, than the
previous speeds. These reduced speeds se-
verely interfered with the OES 5262’s ability
to function effectively. My Information
Technology staff communicated directly
with Verizon via email about the throttling,
requesting it be immediately lifted for public
safety purposes. That email exchange is at-
tached here as Exhibit A. We explained the
importance of OES 5262 and its role in pro-
viding for public and first-responder safety
and requested immediate removal of the
throttling. Verizon representatives con-
firmed the throttling, but, rather than re-
storing us to an essential data transfer
speed, they indicated that County Fire would

have to switch to a new data plan at more
than twice the cost, and they would only re-
move throttling after we contacted the De-
partment that handles billing and switched
to the new data plan.
10. In the interim, County Fire personnel
in were forced to use other agencies’ Internet
Service Providers and their own personal de-
vices to provide the necessary connectivity
and data transfer capability required by OES
5262. While Verizon ultimately did lift the
throttling, it was only after County Fire sub-
scribed to a new, more expensive plan.
11. In light of our experience, County Fire
believes it is likely that Verizon will con-
tinue to use the exigent nature of public
safety emergencies and catastrophic events
to coerce public agencies into higher cost
plans ultimately paying significantly more
for mission critical service—even if that
means risking harm to public safety during
negotiations.
I declare under penalty of perjury under
the laws of the United States of America
that the foregoing is true and correct.
Executed on August at San José, Cali-
fornia.
Anthony Bowden.
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-
port of this bill. To those who may be
viewing and listening in, it sounds as
if, from my Republican friends, that
the sky is actually coming down
around our ears. I have good news for
you. It isn’t.
The ranking member of the full com-
mittee said that the Republicans sim-
ply are opposed to paid prioritization,
throttling, and blocking. But there is
something else that the American peo-
ple need to know. What they are
against here is what they call the
heavy hand of government. We say it is
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion that should be able to enforce the
law against throttling, blocking, and
paid prioritization.
It is as simple as that. They don’t
want a cop on the beat.
This is a very simple, three-page bill,
but it is powerful because it puts in
place the protections that the FCC
came up with in 2015. Notably, the
courts upheld that decision.
There is much talk on the other side
of the aisle about Silicon Valley. You
are not from Silicon Valley; I represent
it. There are companies there that had
filed suit against the ISPs because of
what they have done.
If you don’t think that the ISPs
haven’t misbehaved, talk to the fire-
fighters of Santa Clara County. Talk to
them. They were fighting the worst fire
in California’s history when they were
being throttled. They called Verizon,
and Verizon tried to sell them an up-
graded plan as they were trying to save
lives.
Across America, 86 percent of the
American people—Democrats, Repub-
licans, and Independents—support what
we are doing. We want this for our con-
stituents. We want the protection of
consumers. We don’t want any mitts on
the internet. It is as simple as that.
Groups from A to Z, from the United
States Conference of Catholic Bishops
to the American Library Association,
support this.
I am proud to be a net neutrality
warrior, and I ask everyone in the
House to become one, too, by voting for
H.R. 1644. It is a simple, three-page,
powerful bill that will serve the people
of our country well.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I am
now privileged to yield 5 minutes to
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA),
the ranking Republican on the Commu-
nications and Technology Sub-
committee.
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition
to H.R. 1644, the government takeover
of the internet act.
This is not about net neutrality. If
this was about net neutrality, we
would be operating under the long-
standing bipartisan premise that net
neutrality would be achieved without
title II.
Like many of my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle, I agree that Congress
needed to codify basic internet protec-
tion principles, such as no blocking, no
throttling, and no paid prioritization.
The net neutrality bill I introduced is
based directly upon the proposal from
former Energy and Commerce Chair-
man Henry Waxman, which would pre-
vent internet service providers from
engaging in much of the discrimina-
tory behavior the majority is con-
cerned about. It would do so under title
I.
Both former Republican and Demo-
cratic Federal Communications Com-
mission Chairmen have also recognized
that net neutrality can be resolved
without vastly expanding the FCC’s
power under title II.
It is important to recognize the dif-
ference between title I and title II. The
internet is currently regulated under
title I, which means it is considered an
information service. Besides the 2
years the FCC’s 2015 order was in ef-
fect, the internet has always operated
under title I, since its infancy.
Chairman Wheeler put the internet
under title II rules that classify
broadband as a telecommunication
service. These rules were created in the
1930s for the monopoly telephone sys-
tems and, obviously, do not fit on an
innovative engine that has thrived on
minimal government involvement.
Although the exact framework of net
neutrality has been a bipartisan issue
these past 10 years, we are at a point
where Republicans and Democrats are
aligned on bright-line principles to pre-
serve a free and open internet. Rather
than push through purely partisan leg-
islation drafted by a group of unelected
bureaucrats, I encourage my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1644, so we can en-
gage in a truly bipartisan process on
net neutrality and resolve this issue
once and for all.
There is a menu of legislative options
on the table. Each of these net neu-
trality bills would ensure that the FCC
is a cop on the beat to keep the inter-
net free and open from discriminatory
conduct by ISPs.
As acknowledged by H.R. 1644’s spon-
sor, the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
the bill does not preserve all aspects of
a free and open internet because it does
not address blocking and prioritization
done by edge providers.
It also isn’t clear if the bill addresses
ambiguous definitions from the 2015
order for specialized services or recog-
nizes the unintended consequences in
innovations like advanced network
slicing capabilities in 5G.
The bill also does not protect small
businesses. With over 3,000 ISPs in our
country, most of which are small or
very small, we should make it a pri-
ority to shield these businesses from
onerous regulations.
I offered an amendment at the Rules
Committee that would do just that. It
would have allowed small ISPs to focus
better on expanding their networks and
serving their customers. This amend-
ment was based on a bipartisan com-
promise made in the 114th Congress
and the 115th Congress that unani-
mously passed the House and afforded
small and often rural ISPs predict-
ability.
My Democratic colleagues supported
the 5-year exemption and 250,000-sub-
scriber limit last Congress but seem to
have forgotten their statements about
the need to allow small ISPs to provide
broadband access rather than being
bogged down with these regulations.
b 1545
We have seen broadband investment
and innovation decline during the time
the internet was regulated under the
framework that H.R. 1644 would estab-
lish. This has been verified through
studies, but also in a recent Energy
and Commerce Committee hearing
when a witness who owns a small ISP
in Oregon testified on the hampering
effects the 2015 order had on his own
business. While we can’t quantify lost
investment, we do not know the ad-
vancements in technology we have
missed out on due to limited resources
directed toward innovation.
On the point of not knowing, we still
do not know the 700-plus regulations
that H.R. 1644 would permanently for-
bear from either. Before we perma-
nently lock in anything, I believe Con-
gress should know exactly what we are
locking in. We have pressed the major-
ity for the list multiple times and have
not received it. That is why I filed an
amendment that would have required
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion to produce this list if the bill does
become law.
I support net neutrality, but I cannot
and do not support H.R. 1644. We should
be providing the American people with
a real net neutrality solution rather
than pushing forward an agenda that
does not have the capability to become
law and won’t protect the internet.
I thank the gentleman for yielding,
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Chairman, my friends keep
talking about the government takeover
of the internet. I am glad to see that
they are finally taking a stand against

the foolish 5G nationalization proposal
that the Trump administration can’t
seem to stop talking about.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from North Carolina
(Mr. BUTTERFIELD).
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I
thank Chairman DOYLE for yielding
time this afternoon.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1644. Phone calls and letters
from my constituents make it abun-
dantly clear that they want to see
broadband internet expanded in their
communities, they want greater con-
sumer protections, and they want it
now. The digital divide is holding them
down.
Until someone has lived in a commu-
nity, Mr. Chairman, that does not have
reliable access to high-speed internet,
one cannot comprehend its importance.
Internet connectivity enables students
regardless of their financial cir-
cumstances the opportunity to access
world-class educational resources. It
spurs economic growth by giving busi-
nesses an opportunity to connect with
customers throughout the world. It can
help bring access to quality healthcare
for families in rural communities.
I say to my friends on the other side,
this legislation is not a socialist initia-
tive. It is America, my friends, in the
21st century.
This bill provides permanent net neu-
trality protections and secures a free
and neutral internet for constituents.
This legislation will ensure that all
Americans—Democrat, Republican,
Libertarian, Independent, and Green
Party—will have their voices heard,
their stories told, and equal access to
the information that is important to
them.
The Save the Internet Act addresses
the way in which internet traffic is
handled before it reaches the con-
sumer—an important step toward clos-
ing the digital divide and making the
digital economy more inclusive. The
internet was developed to enable user
choice about what content to access.
That is why we need to pass this legis-
lation, and we need to pass it now.
I appreciate the work of Chairman
DOYLE and the Democratic Caucus for
understanding the urgency of passing
this legislation.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation. Let’s
send it to the Senate. Let’s try to rea-
son with our friends in the Senate, and
let’s get it passed and protect the
internet.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I would
just like to say, when it comes to 5G,
Republicans had an amendment to
keep 5G from being regulated by 1930s
law called title II.
My friends on the other side of the
aisle do not want to get into a big dis-
cussion about the huge regulatory door
they are opening in section 201 and sec-
tion 202 that allows the FCC to basi-
cally run amok with rules. They will
claim that they are locking down what
the FCC did in 2015 but, in fact, while
they may close one door—although we
don’t even know all those 700 rules
they are forbearing against that are
going to go into statute, they can’t
even provide that list and this bill isn’t
going anywhere—they are opening this
other authority—unlimited authority,
frankly—to the FCC to regulate all
these forms of technology.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHN-
SON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise today to join my colleagues
in opposition to the so-called Save the
Internet Act. I say ‘‘so-called’’ because
it really should be called another Big
Government attempt to grab the inter-
net act.
I am disappointed in my colleagues
across the aisle who chose to place par-
tisan politics above the interests of the
American people and refused to work
across party lines to codify actual
workable solutions that prevent anti-
competitive conduct rather than con-
tinuing the political game of informa-
tion technology regulatory ping-pong
under the guise of net neutrality.
Let me be clear, I support an open
and free internet. However, this legis-
lation doesn’t do that.
What it would do is impose heavy-
handed title II regulations on the
internet, which is not only unneces-
sary, but would actually stall
broadband deployment.
From 1996 to 2015, the internet was
thriving. It grew at a rapid, unprece-
dented pace and enabled countless in-
novative technologies that Americans
have come to rely on: connectivity for
businesses, students to do their school-
work, families and friends staying con-
nected, telemedicine, and many other
everyday conveniences.
However, it was under the Big Gov-
ernment grab of then-FCC Chairman
Wheeler and the classification of
broadband as a utility-style tele-
communications service under title II
that we saw a decline in broadband de-
ployment and online innovation and in-
vestment.
This is a serious issue, particularly
for geographically challenging, rural
areas such as eastern and southeastern
Ohio that already struggle with
broadband deployment. The digital di-
vide is very real, and we have a respon-
sibility to provide solutions, not create
additional barriers to employment,
growth, and innovation.
Rural communities don’t need or
want higher costs and fewer options
than they already have, and that is
why I am opposed to this legislation.
As I have stated before, the only saving
the internet needs is from heavy-hand-
ed Washington regulations.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this disingenuous legislation.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Chairman, I would submit
that we are listening to the public and
our constituents. Eighty-six percent of
all Americans—Republicans, Demo-
crats, and Independents—support what
we are doing here today. It is the Re-
publicans who are standing up for a
very small number of ISPs in this
country.
It gives me great pleasure to yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI),
who is the Speaker of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman
for yielding, Mr. Chairman, and I com-
mend him for his extraordinary leader-
ship on this very important subject. To
young people in our country and to
every person in our country from sea
to shining sea and to the future of our
country, I join my colleagues in de-
fense of the free and open internet
which is a pillar of our democracy. I
am pleased to follow Mr. DOYLE and his
leadership; Mr. PALLONE, the chairman
of the committee; Ms. ESHOO, a god-
mother of net neutrality in an earlier
time; Mr. BUTTERFIELD, for his wonder-
ful statement; and I know we will be
hearing from Congresswoman MATSUI
and other Members, and I am honored
to join all of them.
Again, I salute Chairman MIKE
DOYLE for his leadership of the Save
the Internet Act and for his persistent,
dissatisfied leadership to protect net
neutrality. I also commend our former
colleague in the House, Senator MAR-
KEY, for his leadership now in the Sen-
ate.
Let us salute the millions of Ameri-
cans who have marched, mobilized, and
made their voices heard in this fight,
the 4 million Americans who wrote to
the FCC—that would be the Federal
Communications Commission—to sup-
port the 215 Obama-era net neutrality
protections; the 10 million Americans
who weighed in again this time to op-
pose the 2017 Trump decision to destroy
those protections; the 600,000 Ameri-
cans who tuned in to watch a
livestream of the full committee mark-
up on this legislation, and, Mr. Chair-
man, it is now 4.8 million and a grow-
ing number who have watched the com-
mittee proceedings on the House floor
today.
That is so much enthusiasm in our
country, that is the growing extent of
the interest. That is unheard of for the
work that we do here.
Net neutrality is a bipartisan pri-
ority for the American people. As
Chairman DOYLE said, a full 86 percent
of Americans oppose the Trump assault
on net neutrality, including 82 percent
of Republicans outside.
Young people, in particular, get it.
This is about their jobs and their fu-
tures. With the Save the Internet Act,
Democrats are honoring the will of the
American people. We are restoring pro-
tections so that we can stop unjust dis-
criminatory practices by ISPs—that
would be internet service providers—
that try to throttle consumers’ brows-
ing speed, block their internet access,
and increase their costs—throttle their
speed, block their access, and increase
their cost.

April 9, 2019
It would give entrepreneurs and
small businesses a level playing field
on which to compete and ensure Amer-
ican innovation can continue to be the
envy of the world.
This legislation also brings the power
of the internet to every corner of the
country from rural America to cities,
as Mr. BUTTERFIELD pointed out, be-
cause it provides the legal basis for the
Connect America Fund.
We must close the urban-rural digital
divide, although we have challenges in
urban areas as well as in rural areas,
but in rural areas this is a must do. It
will make all the difference in the
world guaranteeing better and cheaper
internet for everyone, so we can create
jobs and unlock the economic potential
of every person in every community.
This debate is not just about legisla-
tion. It is about the quality of people’s
lives. More than 30,000 San Franciscans
in my own district have written my
own office about the impact of net neu-
trality in their lives.
They know that American businesses
are at risk.
One writes:
As a small business owner, I depend on free
and unfettered communication with my cus-
tomers and vendors. My business and per-
sonal lifestyle are in jeopardy.
They know that America’s innova-
tion is at risk.
As a young student writes:
Without net neutrality, we lose our last
medium of allowing small and upcoming
companies to thrive.
They know that our spirit of
entrepreneurialism is at risk. As an-
other constituent writes:
The internet is a place where anyone, rich
or poor, can make a living, become success-
ful, and make themselves known.
They know that our very democracy
is at risk because as one constituent
writes:
A world without net neutrality undermines
a central priority for a democratic society—
the necessity of all citizens to inform them-
selves and each other.
Those are some of the communica-
tions from my constituents.
I will just tell you about a family dis-
cussion I had. I was visiting my broth-
er in Baltimore, Maryland, Thomas
D’Alesandro, and we were sitting
around the table with his children and
grandchildren. We were talking about
one thing and another that was going
on in the country.
I said to his grandson: What do you
think about all of this?
We were talking about national secu-
rity, et cetera.
He said: My friends and I care about
one thing, net neutrality.
That was so exciting to hear, and
here we are delivering for young peo-
ple.
Supporting this bill means sup-
porting our democracy and showing
that our voices—the voices of the pub-
lic—are heard, that their will is re-
spected, and that the internet remains
free and open to all. We call on our Re-
publican colleagues to join us to sup-
port our democracy by restoring net
neutrality.
I hope we have a good, strong bipar-
tisan vote as a tribute to Chairman
DOYLE.
Mr. Chairman, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, again, I
would say Republicans are for stopping
any kind of action that throttles or
blocks even paid prioritization on the
internet. We share that common view
of net neutrality.
But I would remind my colleagues
that the legislation before us does not
in any way provide any regulatory
oversight over where you go when you
get off the ISPs, get off that freeway, if
you will, into places like Google,
Facebook, and Amazon. They are great
American companies. But what I hear
from my constituents is they are con-
cerned about pay prioritization, the se-
curity, the trust, the data, and all of
that that the edge providers are a huge
part of this ecosystem.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
WALBERG).
b 1600
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in opposition to H.R. 1644. I be-
lieve, if we use words appropriately,
that should be named the ‘‘Regain Big
Government Control of the Internet
Act.’’
Thankfully, after 2015, we only had a
short time of what was so-called net
neutrality, which are words that sound
good but aren’t true. It was Big Gov-
ernment takeover of net neutrality,
and this bill opens the door to disas-
trous effects like that on getting
broadband into rural America, where I
live.
I still don’t have broadband. In 2015,
under the so-called net neutrality, we
saw that broadband build-out stop. I
am still looking forward to it someday.
So this bill would take us backwards,
not forwards.
It is clear that the bill also could
have several unintended consequences
which are completely at odds with the
authors’ intended outcomes.
Instead of doubling down on the
light-touch framework which has re-
sulted in the widespread success of the
internet, Mr. Chair, my colleagues
seem more interested in imposing more
and bigger government regulation.
The bill only forbears from what the
FCC claims it forbore from, not what it
can forbear from through the backdoor
of sections 201 and 202.
Instead of letting the markets work
under a framework which still robustly
protects consumers, this bill would in-
ject even more uncertainty into the
market. It seems that, instead of lock-
ing in protections for consumers, the
only thing it is really locking in is
more partisanship.
I urge my colleagues to work with
Republicans on bipartisan legislation
that protects consumers and promotes
broadband deployment in rural Amer-
ica, the place I live and the place I lack
broadband now and, with the continued
effort to have Big Government control,
I probably will still lack.
It is time to change that, and I en-
courage my colleagues to oppose H.R.
1644, the ‘‘Regain Big Government Con-
trol of the Internet Act.’’
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Chair, we keep hearing over
and over again that same mantra,
‘‘government takeover of the inter-
net.’’
What the Republicans call the heavy
hand of government is what is actually
protecting consumers. If they want to
stop a government takeover of the
internet, then they had better talk to
the White House: ‘‘Trump apparently
wants to control 5G in a ‘state-run’ so-
cialist twist to American capitalism.’’
That is where you need to take those
concerns about the government take-
over to.
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
MATSUI), vice chair of the Sub-
committee on Communications and
Technology.
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Chair, I am
pleased to join my colleagues in co-
sponsoring this legislation.
Our internet economy has been the
envy of the world, with good reason.
The first site to ever go live on the
world wide web did so in August 1991,
less than 28 years ago.
Since then, a balance of innovation
and investment has transformed the
internet into a driving force of the
American economy, and that balance
of innovation and investment also re-
quires that the internet remain open.
Innovators, entrepreneurs, busi-
nesses, and consumers rely on the
internet as an open platform for online
commerce, to freely exchange ideas,
and to make internet access more ac-
cessible to more Americans.
To that end, addressing and pre-
venting paid prioritization arrange-
ments that result in consumer harm
has been a priority of mine for years;
and, as I have said through this debate,
the fundamental issue surrounding net
neutrality is ensuring consumers don’t
have to pay more for the same products
and services online.
I am mindful of the potential use
cases that next-generation networks
can facilitate, and I previously intro-
duced legislation to ensure that all
consumers are able to access online
content equally as we balance the serv-
ice requirements and consumer bene-
fits of our open internet policies.
I also want to be clear that I don’t
support taxing the internet, but, going
forward, I welcome a serious conversa-
tion with all my colleagues on uni-
versal service contribution reform in
order to protect the long-term sustain-
ability of rural broadband support.
Net neutrality protections must en-
sure the internet remains an open mar-
ketplace, ensure that the internet is
free of content-based discrimination,
and ensure broadband access is
affordably and reliably deployed across
the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3176 April 9, 2019
Passage of this legislation is an im-
portant step toward these goals, and I
am proud to support it.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, may I in-
quire as to how much time I have re-
maining.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. KAPTUR). The
gentleman from Ohio has 71⁄2 minutes
remaining.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Washington State (Mrs. RODGERS).
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington.
Madam Chair, I appreciate the gen-
tleman yielding.
Madam Chair, I join my colleagues in
rising in opposition to H.R. 1644. What
is most disappointing to me is that it
seems like this is another example of
the Democratic majority, during this
Congress, being more interested in
scoring political points than actually
solving a problem.
In order for this legislation to be-
come law, it is going to require bipar-
tisan support, yet the Democrats have
chosen today to move forward in a par-
tisan way.
The rhetoric around net neutrality
has been driven to a fever pitch. Dire
predictions on the end of the internet
led to death threats against the chair-
man of the FCC and his family, as well
as against some of our own colleagues.
Democrats say they want to save the
internet; however, in the time since
the title II regulations were repealed
under the Trump administration, net-
work speeds are up drastically. Invest-
ment and coverage in rural areas has
increased.
This debate isn’t about the merits of
an open internet. I support an open,
free internet, and I always have. This
is truly about how we shape the future
of our economy:
Do we want to regulate the internet
as a 1930s-style utility where regula-
tions stifle innovation and leave behind
rural and poor Americans?
Do we want an internet economy
that lifts people out of poverty and
provides them with more economic op-
portunities?
As we work to close the digital di-
vide, we need to decrease the barriers
to deployment, not increase them. Im-
posing unnecessary regulations on
small companies providing rural
broadband will only further this divide.
We must protect people in a way that
does not leave underserved areas of our
country behind.
Republicans, for years, have offered
to work across the aisle. I have intro-
duced legislation modeled after a bill
that passed in Washington State, en-
joying bipartisan support overwhelm-
ingly. In fact, it was lauded by Senator
CANTWELL.
She said: ‘‘In our State, Republicans
and Democrats came together. . . .
Why can’t we see this same bipartisan-
ship in the U.S. House?’’
I ask my Democratic colleagues
today that same question.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I would say to the
gentlewoman that we know that net
neutrality rules don’t affect internet
speed or internet investment.
And who says that? The CEOs of all
the internet companies when they are
talking to their Wall Street investors.
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from California (Mr.
MCNERNEY).
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Chair, I rise
today in support of H.R. 1644.
One of the greatest aspects of the
internet is its potential to be an equal-
izer for small businesses that might
not otherwise have resources to set up
a brick-and-mortar shop. The internet
provides them with the means to reach
customers around the world. For stu-
dents who want to learn how to code
but whose schools can’t afford such
classes, the internet opens the door for
them. And for veterans who would oth-
erwise have to drive hours to receive
healthcare services, the internet gives
them the ability to consult with their
doctors wherever they are.
All of this is only possible if internet
access is unfiltered, and that is not the
case today. Today, we don’t even have
a free and open internet because
Trump’s FCC has repealed net neu-
trality protections and set our country
on a path backwards.
More than 8,000 of my constituents
have written to me and called to ex-
press their opposition to elimination of
these protections.
I also held a net neutrality townhall,
where people came from all over my
district. They were of different ages,
occupations, and backgrounds, but
they all had something in common:
They overwhelmingly wanted strong
net neutrality protections.
I have listened to my constituents,
and that is why I am fighting hard to
restore these crucial protections, and
that is why I became an original co-
sponsor of the Save the Internet Act.
We have an opportunity today to
pass legislation that would offer real
protections for constituents. This leg-
islation is simple. It takes an approach
that accounts for the internet of today
and tomorrow, and it provides cer-
tainty for Americans across the coun-
try.
This act will curb monopolistic be-
havior that would gradually strangle
the internet. I am afraid of corporate
takeover of the internet.
My friend, the minority whip, spoke
about how the Telecom Act of 1934 was
passed to curb the monopolies of the
large telephone corporations. Today,
the situation is similar. The ISPs are
large, and they are consolidating with
content providers, a ripe situation for
monopoly.
Americans hate monopolies.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1644.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. WITTMAN).
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Chair, I rise
today in opposition to H.R. 1644, the so-
called Save the Internet Act.
This legislation seeks to restore the
FCC’s heavy-handed, stifling title II
regulations of 2015 to govern the inter-
net, the same antiquated regulations
originally enacted to regulate wired
phone companies of the 1930s.
The internet, which is the single
most important invention in modern
human history, has thrived precisely
due to light-touch regulations. Rein-
stating heavy-handed, stifling title II
regulations on the internet is just
plain bad policy.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle have supported these stifling
title II regulations to ensure what they
call net neutrality and prevent unrea-
sonable discrimination practices of
blocking, throttling, and paid
prioritization.
While I agree with my colleagues
that no business should engage in these
types of unreasonable business prac-
tices, this bill is hardly neutral. It bla-
tantly ignores ‘‘edge providers,’’ such
as Facebook and Google. Just read the
headlines about their great behavior.
They have made headlines for things
like blocking, throttling, and requiring
paid prioritization of consumer inter-
net services.
Additionally, in the 2 years following
the FCC’s 2015 order to regulate the
internet under the stifling title II,
internet investments regulations,
those investments have actually de-
clined for the first time and only time
in U.S. history outside of a recession.
As a Representative of some of the
most unserved rural populations of Vir-
ginia, I have heard from providers,
both large and small, that these sti-
fling title II regulations have hindered
their ability to expand service to rural
populations. This is particularly con-
cerning, as unserved areas already face
extreme challenges to gaining access
to broadband. Reinstating these sti-
fling title II regulations would only
further increase the digital divide be-
tween urban and rural America.
I am a cosponsor of three bills offered
by Ranking Members WALDEN, LATTA,
and RODGERS, all based on bipartisan
approaches, which prohibit the prac-
tices of blocking, throttling, and paid
prioritization. I believe all three of
these bills provide a bipartisan, perma-
nent solution to opening the internet.
I urge my Democratic colleagues to
work with Republicans to solve this
issue.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, may I inquire how
much time I have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Pennsylvania has 141⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I yield myself
such time as I may consume.
This debate can be broken down very
simply. There is agreement on the
three bright lines. So Democrats and
Republicans agree: no blocking, no
throttling, no paid prioritization. But
that is where my friends on the Repub-
lican side stop.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3177
April 9, 2019
Democrats understand that, already,
we see behavior by ISPs that isn’t cov-
ered by those three bright lines, in the
areas of zero rating and interconnec-
tion. There has to be a cop on the beat
to protect consumers.
This bill is very basic. It says we are
going to outlaw the three bright lines.
We all agree with that.
The only things we do in addition to
this are two other things:
Number one, we restore the legal
underpinnings for the Connect America
program, which helps rural broadband,
and the Lifeline program, which helps
our seniors, veterans, and low-income
families in the country. We make it
easier for pole attachments to make
rural deployment of broadband easier
to do, to facilitate that. So we take
care of rural America in the bill.
Then we also say there has to be
someone to look out for consumers if,
somewhere down the road, an ISP finds
a new way to have some unjust or un-
reasonable or discriminatory behavior.
Someone has to have the ability to say:
You can’t do that, and, if you continue
to do that, we are going to levy a fine
or we are going to take action against
you.
b 1615
That is called consumer protection.
What my friends over here want to do
is simply take the three bright lines
and say, okay, we will enforce that be-
cause they have been caught red-hand-
ed doing that. Everybody knows they
have pled guilty to the blocking, the
throttling, and the paid prioritization.
We will outlaw that. But if they find
some new, novel way to game the sys-
tem and disadvantage consumers, we
don’t want anyone to be able to stop
that kind of behavior.
Madam Chair, it is sort of like lock-
ing your front door and leaving the
back door wide open. That is what the
Republicans would have us do, if we
would agree to their so-called com-
promise that they are putting forward.
Let me tell you something. I didn’t
come to Congress to work for internet
service providers. I came to Congress
to protect consumers.
And you are not fooling Americans.
Eighty-six percent of Americans, be
they Democrats, Republicans, or Inde-
pendents, did not want to see the Pai
FCC, the Trump FCC, repeal these net
neutrality rules. There was over-
whelming testimony during the rule-
making from more than 20 million peo-
ple asking the FCC not to take this ac-
tion. This is an issue not only amongst
millennials but all throughout our pop-
ulation.
You have been hearing it on your
telephones, too. That is why you all
want to say you are for something. You
stand there and say we are for a free
and open internet, but what you are for
is allowing these ISPs to figure out
new ways to game the system and
making sure there is no cop on the
beat, the FCC, to be able to regulate
that. That is why we are never going to
agree until we sit down and protect
consumers in this kind of bill.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. Members are re-
minded to address their remarks to the
Chair.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I am pre-
pared to close if the gentleman is. I
have no more speakers.
Madam Chair, how much time do I
have?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio has 31⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
In this debate today, we have heard
both sides, but I really believe that, on
our side, the American people don’t
want to have a takeover of the inter-
net. As we have spoken on our side, we
all believe in the same things. We don’t
want throttling; we don’t blocking; and
we don’t want paid prioritization out
there.
As has been stated already earlier
today, we have had three bills that
were introduced, one being my piece of
legislation that had been introduced by
the former chairman of the Energy and
Commerce Committee that set forth
those policies and also stating that it
should not have title II in it because,
again, you do not want to have the
heavy hand of government coming in
on this.
We had the Republican leader of the
full committee with his legislation,
taking what the FCC has done and put-
ting in legislation to make sure, again,
we don’t have the blocking and the
throttling.
The gentlewoman from Washington
State, when you look at her legisla-
tion, again, it came from a Democratic
legislature, signed by a Democratic
Governor, which stated the same
things: You don’t want to have the
throttling, blocking, or paid
prioritization.
The American people want to make
sure that the internet is out there, that
it is working, and that you don’t have
that heavy hand.
I think it is also important, as has
been noted during the debate—what are
we looking at here? We have had past
FCC Chairmen all saying the same
thing, except for Chairman Wheeler
when he changed and went with the
2015 order. But Republicans and Demo-
crats have all said the same thing, that
this is an information service, not a
telecommunications service that would
be coming under the draconian laws of
the 1930s that were really to take care
of the Ma Bells out there.
We also have seen that this bill does
not cover the edge providers, and a lot
of people would be surprised about
that. The question is raised: Why
aren’t they included in this piece of
legislation? Because if you want to
make sure that everyone is included,
you should have been looking at it in
this piece of legislation, because when
you are looking at the Facebook and
the Twitters out there, what is hap-
pening with them?
I also want to point out that I know
there is some concern when this was
going on back in 2015 and what hap-
pened when the current FCC rescinded
the order. You know, the internet did
not end. I did not get calls the next day
saying I was not able to go online. I
wasn’t unable to do our work or do
anything like that. I never received a
call. So I think it is important we note
that.
At the same time, what we have also
discussed here today, and also in com-
mittee, is that we would like to see the
700 rules and the regs out there that
the FCC forbore on. We still don’t have
those. I have asked, through my
amendment, that we get those because
I think it is important we know what
that is, because how do you know what
they are doing if you don’t see it?
I think that it is very important that
these facts are considered. I think it is
important that we have had this debate
today. But I think it is also important
that we don’t want to have a takeover
by the government of the internet be-
cause we want to make sure that it
does what it has always done. It is
something that was formed out there
that had what they called a light touch
to let it go forward, so I think it is im-
portant that we do that.
For those reasons, Madam Chair, I
would recommend a ‘‘no’’ vote on H.R.
1644, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, how much time
do I have left?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 10 minutes remaining.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I yield myself the
balance of my time.
I appreciate this debate. A couple of
points I would like to make as we
close. I think people need to under-
stand that, 2 years ago, when the
Trump FCC decided to repeal the net
neutrality rules that were in place,
what did they replace them with? How
did they protect consumers when they
decided to repeal the net neutrality
rules put in place by Chairman Wheeler
during the Obama administration? I
will tell you what they did. They did
nothing—nothing, no protections, the
Wild, Wild West. The only thing a con-
sumer could look forward to was, if one
of these ISPs violated their terms and
conditions, they might be able to go
over to the FTC and ask for relief.
Ask the California firefighters how
that worked for them when they were
in the middle of trying to put out these
devastating fires in California and
came up on their data cap and had no
recourse. Ask them if they think that
was unjust or unreasonable behavior.
For Republicans to stand here and
say that they care about net neutrality
rules when they had 2 years when they
controlled the House and the Senate
and the White House to put one of
these three bills they like to talk
about on the floor—because they con-
trolled the floor to pass the bills, to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

pass it in their Republican-controlled
Senate and give it to their Republican
President to implement net neutrality
rules to protect consumers. What did
they do? They did nothing—nothing,
crickets, silence.
Now Democrats control the House of
Representatives. We said that it is im-
portant to all Americans, and all
Americans regardless—Democrats, Re-
publicans, and Independents—wanted
to see those net neutrality rules that
were repealed restored. So what we
have done is we have taken that 2015
open internet order and we said let’s
put this into law. Let’s put this into
statute so that no future FCC Commis-
sioner can come there and change this.
We have forborne on 700 regulations
that were in title II. You keep hearing
this: We are putting the heavy hand of
title II, Ma Bell, 1934 rules on the inter-
net. That is not true. All of those pro-
visions of title II were forborne. They
are not part of this bill.
What did we keep in title II? We kept
the consumer protections in sections
201 and 202. We saved the legal
underpinnings that make it possible to
do the Connect America Fund and the
Lifeline Program. We put a cop on the
beat so that, for future bad behavior on
the part of the ISPs, there is someone
there to say you can’t do that, and if
you try to do that, we can take action
against you.
Now, I ask you, what do the ISPs
have to fear from that? If they are not
acting in an unjust or an unreasonable
or a discriminatory fashion, they have
nothing to worry about.
I would ask my friends, what unjust
and unreasonable and discriminatory
behavior do you think they should be
allowed to engage in?
Well, I have news for you. Just the
three bright lines, that doesn’t cut it
anymore. We have already seen behav-
ior that is discriminatory that isn’t
covered by those three bright lines. If
there is no cop on the beat to enforce
that on behalf of consumers, then it is
the consumers who are the losers.
We are not going to let that happen.
The American people don’t want that
to happen. People of all stripes have
said, loud and clear, that they want to
see commonsense, bipartisan net neu-
trality rules put into place.
When I say bipartisan, the only place
it isn’t bipartisan is here in the House
of Representatives, not out in the
country. The Senate passed a similar
bill last year in their CRA with 52
Members. It was bipartisan.
We tried to put that CRA on the floor
last year, and the Republican majority
wouldn’t put the bill on the floor so
that we could have a vote on it. We
tried a discharge petition to see if we
could get the bill on the floor, and not
a single Republicans helped us pass the
discharge petition so that we could
have a vote on net neutrality.
Let’s not kid ourselves here. Any
chance that Republicans had to have
no regulation on the internet, that is
what they have been about when they
have been in power in this body.
Madam Chair, it is a new day, and it
is a new House of Representatives, one
that listens to the will of the people,
the citizens of America who have said
loud and clear that they want to see
these rules put back in place.
To all my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle, this is your chance to be on
the right side of history. This is your
chance to be on the side of the angels.
I ask all my colleagues to vote for this
bill, vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1644 and re-
store net neutrality rules for all Amer-
icans.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, as a
senior member of the Judiciary Committee
and an original co-sponsor, I rise in strong
support of H.R. 1644, the ‘‘Save the Internet
Act of 2019.’’
The Save the Internet Act puts a cop on the
beat to protect consumers, small businesses,
and competition from abusive practices of
internet service providers and codifies popular,
bipartisan, and targeted net neutrality protec-
tions.
An overwhelming 86 percent of Americans
opposed the FCC’s roll back of the same pro-
tections that would be enacted by the Save
the Internet Act, including 82 percent of Re-
publicans.
The Save the Internet Act mirrors the similar
bipartisan Congressional Review Act legisla-
tion that passed the Senate last Congress and
had 182 bipartisan signers in the House.
The Save the Internet Act restores nec-
essary, common-sense provisions for defend-
ing the internet put in place by the FCC during
the Obama Administration and stops the cur-
rent Trump-dominated FCC from applying
more than 700 regulations under the Commu-
nications Act that are unnecessary to pro-
tecting an open internet such as rate setting.
The Save the Internet Act represents true
net neutrality protections that are designed for
today and tomorrow without loopholes.
The Save the Internet Act includes en-
hanced transparency protections, and enacts
specific rules against blocking, throttling, and
paid prioritization.
The legislation empowers the FCC to inves-
tigate consumer and business complaints,
and, when necessary, fine internet service
providers for violations of the Communications
Act.
Additionally, the Save the Internet Act em-
powers the FCC to stop internet service pro-
viders from undermining net neutrality prin-
ciples through new and harmful mechanisms.
Because of the Save the Internet Act, no
longer will internet service providers be able to
exploit choke points online, such as inter-
connection points, which creates bottlenecks
and stifle internet connectivity.
Another reason why all Members should
support the Save the Internet Act is because
it provides important new authorities that can
be used to support broadband access and
adoption for rural communities and struggling
Americans.
The Save the Internet Act also restores au-
thorities the FCC used starting in 2016 to fund
broadband for low-income Americans, includ-
ing veterans, seniors, students, and disabled
Americans, under the Lifeline program that
has subsidized phone service since the
Reagan Administration, but only began fully
supporting internet access recently.
Madam Chair, nothing in the Save the Inter-
net Act would diminish internet service pro-
viders’ investments in broadband.
It should be noted that internet service pro-
viders did not cut back on investing, deploying
and increasing speeds in 2015 and 2016,
when the kind of protections the bill restores
were put in place by the FCC.
In fact, after the Trump FCC repealed those
protections, investments by many of the larg-
est providers went down despite their claims
that just opposite would happen.
Finally, Madam Chair, it should be noted the
legislation before us affirms several important
principles and values, including the following:
1. A free and open internet is the single
greatest technology of our time, and control
should not be at the mercy of corporations.
2. A free and open internet stimulates inter-
net service provider competition.
3. A free and open internet helps prevent
unfair pricing practices.
4. A free and open internet promotes inno-
vation.
5. A free and open internet promotes the
spread of ideas.
6. A free and open internet drives entrepre-
neurship.
In short, Madam Chair, a free, open, and vi-
brant internet protects and strengthens our de-
mocracy.
I urge all Members to join me in voting to
save the internet for all of our people by voting
to pass H.R. 1644, the ‘‘Save the Internet Act
of 2019.’’
The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-
eral debate has expired.

ture of a substitute recommended by

merce, printed in the bill, it shall be in

to consider amendment No. 1 printed in
part A of House Report 116–37.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I have

The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Add at the end the following:
SEC. 4. GAO REPORT ON INTERNET ECOSYSTEM.
Not later than 1 year after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States shall submit to
Congress a report examining the effect of the
rules described in section 2(b) on the vir-
tuous cycle of the internet ecosystem and
whether such rules protect the access of con-
sumers to a free and open internet.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 294, the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Texas.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I yield
myself 2 minutes.
This amendment directs the Comp-
troller General of the United States to
submit to Congress a report examining
the influence of all entities on the vir-
tuous cycle of the internet ecosystem
and whether such rules protect the ac-
cess of consumers to a free and open
internet.
A portion of a consumer’s online ex-
perience is through social media plat-
forms and through other edge pro-
viders. Examples of this would include
Facebook, Google, Twitter, and
YouTube, among others.
b 1630
Nothing in the Save the Internet Act
reviews all parts of the internet eco-
system. Yet, so-called edge providers
are the services exercising the most
discretion over content delivery.
As we saw last year with testimony
in the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee from Facebook and Twitter, the
algorithms written by these companies
are proprietary, and those proprietary
algorithms may manipulate consumer
access. We understand the role of these
service providers and how each is
weighted against the others. We have
transparency rules for broadband pro-
viders, but not for edge providers.
The bill targets broadband service
providers by reclassifying them as util-
ities under title II of the Communica-
tions Act, but we cannot achieve effec-
tive net neutrality principles without
including the influence of edge pro-
viders on the internet ecosystem. For
this reason, the amendment simply di-
rects the Government Accountability
Office to study the full internet eco-
system so that we can better under-
stand the influence of all online enti-
ties in order to protect access to a free
and open internet for every consumer.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.

ment a bill of the House of the fol-
lowing title:

SAVE THE INTERNET ACT OF 2019
The Committee resumed its sitting.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I claim the time
in opposition to the amendment, even
though I am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. KAPTUR).
Without objection, the gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I yield myself as
much time as I may consume.
The Save the Internet Act is nar-
rowly focused on ISPs as the gate-
keepers to the internet. They control
the networks, so they have the ability
to shape and control traffic as it moves
over their network.
Edge providers play a different role
in the internet ecosystem and are not
in the same class as internet service
providers.
There are numerous cases of docu-
mented abuses by ISPs going back sev-
eral years. I am sure that is a big part
of why net neutrality has such over-
whelming bipartisan support. Even 82
percent of Republicans oppose the
FCC’s 2017 rollback of the rules.
Now, that is not to say that there are
not problems on the edge—there are—
but that is not what this bill is about.
So in the spirit of bipartisanship, we
are going to accept this amendment.
We hear the concerns of Mr. BURGESS
and our friends on the other side of the
aisle, and we want to work together
with them to address this.
We appreciate Mr. BURGESS’ willing-
ness to work with us to find a com-
promise on this issue.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I yield

egon (Mr. WALDEN), the valuable rank-
ing member of the full committee.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I want
to thank the gentleman from Texas

cepting this very thoughtful approach.

cerned about the role that tech compa-
nies play in this Information Age. You

read about how content gets blocked,
gets prioritized, or in some cases alleg-
edly shadow banned.
We increasingly see these tech gi-
ants’ inability to curb harmful and il-
licit behavior online while they mone-
tize our personal information.
Now, these are incredibly important
platforms as well, they are great Amer-
ican companies, but in most cases,
they come about as close to a monop-
oly as I have ever seen.
Meanwhile, these edge providers get
special protection under section 230 of
the 1996 Telecommunications Act and
they are not covered by the net neu-
trality rules that we are discussing
today. They are not covered at all.
This bill does nothing to protect con-
sumers from online abuses.
When Republicans were in the major-
ity, I personally presided over hearings
with the heads of some of the most im-
portant tech companies in America.
Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and
Jack Dorsey of Twitter came before
our committee, sat inside the Rayburn
hearing room, and talked to us for
hours.
Our majority enacted landmark pro-
tections against online human sex traf-
ficking that received the support of
both sides of the aisle. We moved for-
ward with that legislation. It is now
law.
Just as the internet has not stopped
working from rescinding the 2015 order,
the internet has not stopped working
because we enacted protections like
FOSTA and SESTA. The internet still
works.
But more improvements can be made
in how we bring responsibility to this
sector of the internet. We should re-
view all participants in the virtuous
cycle of the internet ecosystem, and
that is the aim of this amendment.
The amendment calls on the Govern-
ment Accountability Office to rec-
ommend solutions in dealing with edge
providers, so they do not abuse their
special privileges that the 1996 act gave
them.
This is our third revision of the
amendment to make it acceptable to
move forward with the majority. I cer-
tainly had hoped we wouldn’t
outsource this responsibility to the
GAO over the FCC, not to mention the
Energy and Commerce Committee and
Congress, but I certainly believe we
must make progress on this issue for
the benefit of all American consumers
and for the health of the overall inter-
net ecosystem.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, we know the FCC
does not have the authority to regulate
the edge providers, and we know cur-
rently, since there are no net neu-
trality rules, the only recourse people
have is to the FTC. Chairman Pai as-
sured people that the FTC can fully po-
lice net neutrality.
Well, here is a nice article: ‘‘FTC
gives ISPs green light to block applica-
tions as long as they disclose it.’’
So, there it is, ladies and gentlemen,
these protections which you want to
send over to the FTC, they have just
now told the world that as long as they
put it in their terms and conditions,
they can block applications if they
choose to do so.
The gentleman from Texas and the
gentleman from Oregon, both friends,
bring up valid concerns about edge pro-
viders, but this isn’t the bill where it
belongs. But we do want to work with
them, and I look forward to engaging
both of them and my good friend, the
ranking member of the Communication
and Technology Subcommittee, as we
go forward to look into that part of the
ecosystem.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, again,
this bill targets broadband service pro-
viders by reclassifying them as utili-
ties under title II of the Communica-
tions Act, but we cannot achieve net
neutrality principles without including
the influence of edge providers on the
internet ecosystem.
For this reason, the amendment sim-
ply directs the GAO to study the full
ecosystem so that we can understand
the influence of all online entities and,
again, provide a free and open internet
for every consumer.
Madam Chair, I certainly want to
thank the chairman of the sub-
committee and thank the ranking
member of the full committee for par-
ticipating in this amendment discus-
sion.
Madam Chair, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote,
and I yield back the balance of my

The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. LATTA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in
part A of House Report 116–37.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk, No. 2.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Add at the end the following:
SEC. 4. REPORT.
Not later than 3 days after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Federal Commu-
nications Commission shall submit to the
Committee on Energy and Commerce of the
House of Representatives and the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
of the Senate a report that lists the 27 provi-
sions of title II of the Communications Act
of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) and the over 700
rules and regulations referred to in para-
graphs 5 and 37 of the Report and Order on
Remand, Declaratory Ruling, and Order de-
scribed in section 2(b)(1).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 294, the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. LATTA) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Ohio.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I rise in
support of my amendment that would
require the Federal Communications
Commission to provide a list of the 700
rules and regulations it claims it
forbore from in the 2015 Open Internet
Order.
This list will be provided to the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee and the
Senate Commerce Committee within 3
days of enactment of H.R. 1644.
The need for this amendment arises
out of the majority’s claim that H.R.
1644 would lock in all provisions of law
and regulations that the FCC forbore
from applying to internet service pro-
viders in 2015.
At that time, the FCC claimed it
forbore from applying over 700 regula-
tions, but never made clear what 700
rules it was exempting ISPs from under
title II.
For broadband providers to know
what regulations actually apply to
them, they need to know what provi-
sions of law the FCC forbore from.
For the FCC to arrive at the number
of over 700, it seems they must have
analyzed the Code of Federal Regula-
tions to determine which rules were ap-
plicable to broadband and which were
not, but the FCC never made that list
public.
We have asked the majority on mul-
tiple occasions for help tracking down
that list. Instead of helping locate it,
the majority has doubled down on the
public statements made by the Obama
FCC quantifying that number.
Now that H.R. 1644 might be passed
by the House of Representatives, it is
time to make it clear which rules of
the road will not apply to broadband
providers.
H.R. 1644 already imposes enough un-
certainty on broadband providers, be-
cause it would give the FCC broad au-
thority under title II to regulate the
internet beyond even the bright-line
rules.
If we cannot clear up that uncer-
tainty before this bill gets passed, we
should do all we can to let the public
know what the bill does after it would
become law.
Unless we require the FCC to produce
that list, we will never know what is in
the bill.
We must do better for the American
public and provide more transparency
to support broadband employment, in-
vestment, and growth.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I claim the time
in opposition to the amendment, even
though I am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, the overwhelm-
ingly popular Save the Internet Act
would restore the commonsense and
much loved net neutrality protections
adopted by the FCC’s 2015 net neu-
trality order.
These protections were comprehen-
sive in addressing bad behavior, but

targeted so as not to be overly burden-
some. The agency made sure that dated
and unnecessary provisions of the Com-
munications Act and certain imple-
menting regulations did not apply to
broadband internet service. In fact, the
2015 order says that more than 700 reg-
ulations would not apply to broadband.
While the industry apparently didn’t
need the FCC to tell them what wasn’t
in the order, our Republican colleagues
have raised a concern that more clarity
is needed.
Madam Chair, I don’t remember the
last time, however, that legislation
was brought to the floor and concerns
were raised about what the legislation
didn’t do and where we asked for an
enumerated list of provisions the legis-
lation didn’t apply to.
That being said, I support greater
clarity. The gentleman’s amendment
would require the FCC to publish a list
of all the provisions and regulations
that were forborne by the 2015 order.
Importantly, this wasn’t an issue at
all when these net neutrality protec-
tions were in place for nearly 3 years,
but our Republican colleagues have
raised a concern, and in the spirit of bi-
partisanship, we will support this
amendment.
Given that we are taking affirmative
steps to address the concerns, we hope
they will be persuaded to join us in
supporting this immensely popular
commonsense legislation.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I yield as
much time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN),
the Republican leader of the Energy
and Commerce Committee.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I want
to thank Mr. LATTA for bringing this
very thoughtful amendment to the
House floor, and I want to thank my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
who, I believe, agreed to accept it, if I
heard that correctly.
The bill would codify the forbearance
of 700 regulations into law, as you
probably heard, Madam Chair. How-
ever, we just don’t know what those 700
provisions that are being forborne upon
are.
We have repeatedly asked for that in-
formation in the subcommittee, in the
full committee, and every step of the
way.
b 1645
In fact, I don’t think the authors of
this legislation could tell us today
what those 700 provisions are, although
they get referenced from time to time.
We are told that is really the underpin-
ning and crux of this legislation, that,
in all these areas of law, the FCC said,
‘‘We are not going to, basically, regu-
late in this area,’’ and they said there
are about 700 of these.
So I think it does matter, if you are
in business or just whatever you do in
your life, to not know what the govern-
ment—a pretty big, powerful govern-
ment here in Washington—is going to
enforce or not enforce or regulate or
not regulate, and we don’t know. But
we are being asked today, in this bill,
to enshrine in Federal law the whole
700 of these that the FCC—not this one,
not a future one, we are told—would
ever regulate in.
So we want the list. That is what this
amendment asks for.
But wouldn’t it be better when we
legislate to actually know what we are
legislating on before we vote? That is a
pretty simple concept in good legis-
lating, I think, and that is why we re-
peatedly asked for it; and, obviously,
we have not been able to get it, so it is
a bit of an irony.
Now, at the same time, they say
don’t worry because the FCC—you can
trust us. The FCC is never going to reg-
ulate in this area. And, in fact, we are
going to take these forbearances and
lock them into statute and they can
never come back and everything is
locked down solid, boom. But that is
like locking the front door of your
house while you open the backdoor.
And the backdoor is another part
under title II. This is the argument on
the floor today. It is not about block-
ing, throttling, or paid prioritization.
You have heard us go back and forth,
and we both agree. We can stop those
bad behaviors, and we should, and that
could become law. This bill will not be-
come law.
But they open the backdoor and say
to the FCC: You have got the right,
under sections 201 and 202, to basically
do anything you want through a rule-
making. So all the agency has to do is
do a rulemaking, and basically they
can do everything they have done be-
fore and more.
It is that uncertainty of regulation
on the internet that we have referred
to as the heavy-handed government.
And this could be about taxing the
internet, fees on the internet, et
cetera, et cetera.
So I am glad we are doing this
amendment, and I am glad the major-
ity is going to accept it. I only wish it
were a list before us in the RECORD
today, Madam Chair.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, how much time
do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Pennsylvania has 3 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I am thrilled to
get the gentleman this information. I
know the FCC has it and will be happy
to share it with him.
It is kind of amusing that he wants
to know what regulations we aren’t
putting on business. I thought they
were the guys who didn’t like any regu-
lations on business. Now they are dying
to know where are these 700 regula-
tions that aren’t going to be put in the
bill.
What is important about the bill is
not what is not in the bill, but what is
in the bill. That is what they need to
focus on. This is kind of like Geraldo
Rivera trying to open Al Capone’s safe.
They are just dying to know what
those 700 regulations are.
And guess what. We are going to pass
this bill and vote with them on this, so
that desire to know what isn’t in the
bill will finally be satisfied. I am sure
that their Chairman, Chairman Pai,
the current Chairman of the FCC, will
be more than happy to hand them that
list once we pass this bill. I will be
happy to do that for our friends.
We on the Democratic side support
the amendment and intend to vote
‘‘yes’’ on the amendment.
Mr. WALDEN. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. I yield to the gentleman from
Oregon.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Chair, I appre-
ciate that from my good friend.
If it were that easy to get that list,
why didn’t they get it for us from the
Chairman of the FCC before we went
through this whole process? We
shouldn’t have to vote on the bill to
find out what is in it.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, reclaiming my
time, I was just amazed that he didn’t
have the list already. That is his good
friend over there, and I am sure a quick
phone call on his point would have sat-
isfied this curiosity he has.
Madam Chair, I am happy to enter-
tain this. I intend to vote ‘‘yes’’ on
this, and I yield back the balance of my
time.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I rise in strong support
of H.R. 1644, the Save the Internet Act.
The Save the Internet Act is a simple
and transparent piece of legislation
that will restore the widely supported
2015 Open Internet Order rules and re-
instate the consumer protections pre-
viously applied to industry by the Fed-
eral Communications Commission. I
am proud to support the Save the
Internet Act and thrilled to see Con-
gress doing its job and protecting con-
sumers once again.
Across the United States, more than
129 million people are limited to a sin-
gle provider for broadband internet ac-
cess. Of those 129 million Americans,
about 52 million must obtain internet
access from a company that has vio-
lated network neutrality protections in
the past and continues to undermine
the policy today. This leaves over 177
million Americans, in primarily under-
served communities, left without any
market protection following the repeal
of the 2015 Open Internet Order.
The FCC’s repeal of the 2015 Open
Internet Order harmed all internet
users, but it disproportionately hurt
people of color in underserved commu-
nities. This is unacceptable, and Con-
gress must fulfill its duty to represent
and protect Americans’ interests.
My amendment would call on the
Comptroller General and the Govern-
ment Accountability Office to conduct
a study on the importance of net neu-
trality and what access to the internet
means to those in vulnerable commu-
nities. Specifically, it will examine the
importance of net neutrality on the
socioeconomically disadvantaged, indi-
viduals with disabilities, the elderly,
racial and ethnic minorities, and indi-
viduals from rural communities.
By mandating that the study be con-
ducted by the GAO, we can ensure that
the data collected is transparent and
free of political motivation. With this
report, Congress will be able to decide
for itself what the best course for it
will be for the vulnerable consumer.
Over 80 percent of Americans support
net neutrality and agree that an open
internet uplifts the voices of people of
color, rural communities,
socioeconomically disadvantaged, the
elderly, and disabled. It is no coinci-
dence that all these constituencies
have joined together, alongside mil-
lions of individual internet users. An
open internet levels the playing field
and gives all Americans a better shot
at prosperity and a better opportunity
to achieve the American Dream.
Madam Chair, I urge all my col-
leagues to support gathering critical
information to help us improve
connectivity for our most vulnerable
Americans and to vote in the affirma-
tive for my amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I appre-
ciate my colleague, the gentlewoman’s
concern for disadvantaged and vulner-
able groups and the possible impact of
the 2015 Open Internet Order on their
ability to get connected online and
have access to all the economic and so-
cial opportunities the internet has
made possible. These are all very im-
portant questions to consider, and so I
will not oppose this amendment.
However, I hope my colleagues will
consider just as much the possibility
that throwing the internet into title II
and all of the heavy-handed govern-
ment regulation that it represents may
not be the best way to address the con-
cerns of these populations.
We completely agree with the trans-
formative impact of the internet on
minorities, rural populations, individ-
uals with disabilities, the elderly, and
the socioeconomically disadvantaged.
In many ways, the internet is even
more important to these populations
than to anyone else.
So what would really help to bridge
the digital divide and get more of these
folks connected? I would argue what is
most critical in this problem we are all
trying to solve is, number one, to en-
courage investment.
But you have heard me say it before,
and I will say it again: Title II is a dev-
astating investment killer. We saw
those numbers take a dip after the FCC
diverged from the longstanding bipar-
tisan path of light-touch regulation
into the 1930s era monopoly regulation
of title II.
So what impact would the title II re-
classification have on the disadvan-
taged and vulnerable populations we
are talking about with this amend-
ment? How will it impact future de-
ployment that could connect them?
Maybe we should also have the GAO
looking into that.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance

Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE).
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I thank my friend
for yielding.
Madam Chair, during our commit-
tee’s hearing on net neutrality in the
Save the Internet Act, we heard testi-
mony about the importance of a free
and open internet to vulnerable popu-
lations and groups underrepresented in
the traditional media. The message
was clear:
Net neutrality protections are crit-
ical to vulnerable populations.
Net neutrality is critical for minor-
ity communities to have their stories
told. It is a lifeline to connecting with
job training, employment searches, and
family connections.
Net neutrality is important for en-
suring that small businesses or aspir-
ing writers can use the internet to find
customers and fan bases across the
country or across the globe.
Madam Chair, this is an important
issue, and I fully support the gentle-
woman’s amendment.

ALONE BROADBAND.

Mr. DELGADO. Madam Chair, I yield

Madam Chair, I want to first thank
my colleague, Chairman DOYLE, for his
leadership on this bill.
The Save the Internet Act restores
critical net neutrality protections that
the FCC repealed last year. This legis-
lation is necessary to hold on firm
legal ground the net neutrality prin-
ciples we should all support: no block-
ing, no throttling, and no paid
prioritization.
While ensuring a free and open inter-
net is of the utmost importance, so,
too, is ensuring broadband internet ac-
cess for all. In fact, according to the
FCC’s 2018 Communications Market-
place Report, nearly one in four Ameri-
cans lack access to broadband internet
service at home.
As a proud Representative of one of
the most rural congressional districts

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3183

a huge problem this is. Individuals and
small businesses in my district still
lack access to stand-alone broadband
internet because of high service costs,
a lack of broadband infrastructure, and
outdated and unreasonable bundling
practices that require consumers to
purchase a home telephone service or a
cable package as a condition for pur-
chasing broadband internet service.
b 1700
In today’s global economy,
broadband shouldn’t come with any
strings attached. That is why my
amendment would give GAO 1 year to
report to Congress on the benefits to
consumers of making broadband inter-
net service available to everyone on a
standalone basis.
Additionally, it would include rec-
ommendations to Congress on ways to
increase the availability of stand-alone
broadband internet service to con-
sumers, particularly those living in
rural areas.
Consumers increasingly don’t want
to buy big cable bundles. They just
want access to the internet. That is
why I urge support for this amendment
and for the underlying bill.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I appre-
ciate my colleague’s interest, the gen-
tleman’s interest in stand-alone
broadband. As he knows, this is a real-
ly important issue, especially in rural
America, and one that the FCC has
spent considerable time on, in fact, one
that I have spent considerable time on
as one of the co-chairs of the Rural
Broadband Caucus.
So I do not oppose this amendment,
but I want to observe here that this
amendment will not do anything to re-
lieve the smallest ISPs found in the
most rural areas from some of the
worst excesses of this bill.
So I must say, I am disappointed that
our friends in the majority refuse to
give us a vote on my amendment,
which would have included the lan-
guage on small businesses that was
passed unanimously by the House in
the last two Congresses.
This amendment was exactly the
same as the one that the Democrats
have agreed—twice—to tie to the origi-
nal 2015 order. It would have extended
the exemption for small ISPs from the
Obama FCC’s enhanced transparency
rule for 5 years and expanded the ex-
emption to include businesses with
250,000 subscribers or fewer.
I am supportive of protecting the
consumers of small ISPs, but these en-
hanced disclosures placed an unneces-
sary regulatory burden on small busi-
nesses and distracted them from work-
ing to bring broadband internet access
to customers across the country, espe-
cially those in rural America.
My colleagues in the majority seem
supportive of the plight of the small,
rural ISPs but could not support this
amendment at subcommittee—even
though they had voted to support it
twice before. Instead, they asked us to
find yet another bipartisan agreement
on an issue that we have already spent
hours negotiating and have already
found common ground.
We held up our end of the bargain,
even as we walked away from the deal
that they agreed to twice before and
proceeded to dig in on terms of the
FCC’s 2015 order instead.
Although time has passed since the
Small Business Broadband Deployment
Act, H.R. 4596, passed the House unani-
mously in the 114th Congress with a
vote of 411–0 and was reintroduced in
the 115th Congress and passed on voice
vote as H.R. 288, the need still exists to
promote the continued deployment of
broadband and prevent small ISPs from
becoming burdened with additional re-
quirements that make it more difficult
to do what they are in business to do.
In fact, based on our hearings in the
past Congress and some of the state-
ments on the floor today, I think it is
safe to say there is bipartisan con-
sensus on the need to support rural
broadband for consumers.
As a reminder, my amendment would
not have let small ISPs skirt trans-
parency. Instead, they would follow the
less onerous transparency rules adopt-
ed by the FCC in 2010. So consumers
would still have access to the informa-
tion needed to make informed deci-
sions about their internet service, and
ISPs could focus on providing service
rather than cumbersome regulatory re-
quirements.
I believe my friends across the aisle
when they say they care about expand-
ing broadband in rural America and
closing the digital divide. Although, if
they truly cared as much as they claim
to, I would have expected my amend-
ment to be made in order and to be
adopted unanimously as it has been by
the House in the past.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE),
chairman of the Subcommittee on
Communications and Technology.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I thank the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. DELGADO),
my friend.
You know, the FCC does need to do
more to support the funding of stand-
alone broadband, particularly for rural
areas, and this amendment will help
push them to do that.
The Save the Internet Act would re-
store many of the key authorities the
FCC can use to fund rural broadband
deployment in the future. It is really
hard to understate how important that
is for rural America, and this amend-
ment would help us do even more.
This amendment would simply re-
quire the GAO to study the benefits of
stand-alone broadband plans and how
we in Congress can increase the avail-
ability of these stand-alone plans in
rural areas of the country where
broadband is so hard to come by.
I support this amendment. It is a
wonderful addition to a bill that would
restore net neutrality to everyone
across this country and help support
rural broadband build-out as well.
Madam Chair, I look forward to
working with the gentleman from New
York.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, we do not
oppose the amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Chair, I yield

Chairman DOYLE for introducing this
critical legislation and urge Members

ance of my time.

tleman from New York (Mr. DELGADO).
The question was taken; and the Act-

peared to have it.

SEC. 4. REPORT BY FCC ON ENFORCEMENT AC-
TIONS.
Not later than 1 year after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Federal Commu-
nications Commission shall submit to the
Committee on Energy and Commerce of the
House of Representatives and the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
of the Senate a report that describes all en-
forcement actions taken by the Commission
under the rules described in section 2(b)

amount of each fine imposed or settlement
agreed to, the actions taken by the Commis-
sion to collect such fines and settlements,
and the amounts of such fines and settle-
ments collected.

Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, the Save
the Internet Act of 2019 empowers the
Federal Communications Commission,
the FCC, to enforce net neutrality, pro-
tect consumers, and assist them with
complaints against their internet serv-
ice providers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3184 April 9, 2019
The FCC can fine internet service
providers when they break the rules.
However, simply issuing fines to a bad
actor isn’t enough to change the behav-
ior of those bad actors. Those fines
need to be collected. Corporations that
break the law must pay.
My amendment would require the
FCC to report to Congress within 1
year on the number of enforcement ac-
tions it has taken against internet
service providers that violate net neu-
trality. Importantly, that report must
include both the fines imposed and the
amounts collected.
The FCC must act as a cop on the
beat when internet service providers
misbehave, protecting consumers and
keeping the internet free and open to
all.
When the FCC finds a bad actor, that
fine should be paid by the company. If
the FCC is not following through on
protecting consumers, Congress should
know so it can take oversight action, if
necessary.
The FCC failing to collect fines is a
real concern. Recently, The Wall
Street Journal has highlighted the ex-
tent of the problem.
While the FCC has imposed record
fines on robocallers—$208 million—it
has collected less than $7,000 since 2015.
That is 0.003 percent of the fines im-
posed.
When everyday Americans get a
parking ticket or a traffic violation,
the government makes sure that they
pay their fines. Corporations must be
held accountable as well.
As we vote to restore a free and open
internet, we should also vote to provide
oversight of the agency tasked to pro-
tect consumers.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support my amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I agree
with the gentlewoman from California
(Ms. PORTER), my colleague, that FCC
enforcement is important in any area
that the agency regulates, and that is
why we will not oppose this amend-
ment.
That is also why we in the majority
have asked, at several hearings, when
we were going to have our first FCC
oversight hearing this Congress. We are
4 months into this Congress, and the
majority has yet to bring the FCC be-
fore the committee to answer questions
relating to its past enforcement efforts
on ISPs, the impact of this legislation,
and other topics pending at the FCC.
This is an issue that could have
gained by having the FCC before the
committee rather than the topic being
delegated to a report that does not per-
tain to the base bill.
This is also an issue that could have
gained from bipartisan negotiations.
All three Republican net neutrality
bills would have the FCC oversee ISP
practices and enforce net neutrality to
keep a free and open internet.
There is more agreement here than
the majority would have you believe.
There is also a role for the FCC to have
in overseeing net neutrality and main-
taining a free and open internet, and
there should be clear net neutrality
rules on the book.
Where we disagree is on giving the
FCC unchecked powers to regulate the
internet and determine on its own
what is just and reasonable. That is not
net neutrality.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I just
want to clarify that this amendment
doesn’t define the power that the FCC
would have to regulate, but would
merely make sure that, when it does
take action, the companies are held ac-
countable for the fines that are im-
posed.
I appreciate that my colleague from
the other side of the aisle does not op-
pose the amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to my
colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. MI-
CHAEL F. DOYLE).
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I thank the gen-
tlewoman for yielding.
The important protections we are
discussing today will only be a tooth-
less tiger if the FCC is not taking ac-
tion to investigate potential violations
and taking enforcement action where
it is warranted.
The great thing about this amend-
ment is that the FCC will have to come
back to us 1 year after the Save the
Internet Act is adopted and tell us
what kinds of investigations and en-
forcement actions they have under-
taken.
It also shines a light on whether the
FCC follows through with its enforce-
ment actions. As we just heard, re-
cently, it was reported that even
though the FCC fined robocallers $208
million, it only collected $7,000.
Remind me not to use them as my
collection agent.
Rules aren’t a deterrent unless there
are real consequences. This amendment
will help Congress determine if the
FCC is truly doing its job and better fa-
cilitate the critical oversight role of
this body.
I fully support this amendment, and I
look forward to getting this report.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. POR-
TER).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 6 OFFERED BY MS. WEXTON
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 6 printed in
part A of House Report 116–37.
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Add at the end the following:
SEC. 4. PLAN RELATING TO FORM 477 DATA COL-
LECTION.
Not later than 30 days after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Federal Commu-
nications Commission shall submit to Con-
gress a report containing a plan for how the
Commission will evaluate and address prob-
lems with the collection on Form 477 of data
regarding the deployment of broadband
Internet access service (as defined in section
8.2 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 294, the gentlewoman
from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Virginia.
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Chair, I rise in
support of this amendment, which
would require the FCC to submit to
Congress a plan for how the Commis-
sion will evaluate and address problems
with the collection on form 477 of data
regarding the deployment of broadband
internet access service.
Form 477 is used by the FCC to deter-
mine which providers are—if any—pro-
viding services in various areas, and it
is the government’s main source of
data used for identifying underserved
areas of opportunity.
This amendment is needed because it
has been more than 20 months—or al-
most 2 years—since the FCC originally
sought comment on ways to improve
the value of the data they collect
through form 477.
Having better data and the creation
of improved maps is essential to ensur-
ing that service providers and govern-
ment have the tools that we need to
truly make universal broadband inter-
net access a reality.
Too many residents of my district,
and many other districts as well, lack
affordable or any broadband internet
access. This untenable situation is only
made worse by maps and data charts
that don’t accurately reflect this expe-
rience of our constituents on the
ground.
Consumers should not bear the re-
sponsibility or burden of reporting on
an issue that the FCC and service pro-
viders should actively be working to
address.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.

Mr. LATTA. Madam Chair, I am
pleased to see the Democrats bring so
many ideas today as it comes to rural
broadband, and because of that, we will
not oppose this amendment.
The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHN-
SON) on our committee has been a
strong advocate of improving the 477
data at the FCC and how to have the
National Telecommunications and In-
formation Administration, the NTIA,
more engaged in mapping by aggre-
gating resources across the Federal
Government. He was part of an effort

last fall that shared a draft reauthor-
ization of NTIA with the Democrats
that would have helped get more
granular information. Unfortunately,
our friends on the other side of the
aisle put down their pens on this effort.
In our markup last week, Mr. JOHN-
SON offered an amendment that was
voted down by the majority that would
have eased the title II albatross from
small rural carriers. Sadly, this was re-
jected. Coincidentally, we saw a num-
ber of the Democratic amendments
made in order to study the problems of
rural broadband deployment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE).
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Chair, I thank the gen-
tlewoman for yielding to me.
The Save the Internet Act is going to
ensure that net neutrality throughout
this country is ensured, and, hopefully,
it is going to bring the internet to all
parts of this country. It will do that, in
part, by restoring the legal authority
of section 706 of the Telecommuni-
cations Act, which gives the FCC au-
thority to take immediate action to
accelerate deployment of such capa-
bility by removing barriers to infra-
structure investment and by promoting
competition in the telecommuni-
cations market.
The FCC’s 477 data is critical for get-
ting an accurate picture of broadband
deployment in this country, but the
methods of collecting that data are
outdated, and the results are some-
times rife with errors.
This amendment calls upon the FCC
to submit a report within 30 days of en-
actment, detailing how it plans to
evaluate and address problems with the
collection of that form 477 data.
We have already seen how inaccurate
Commission data can lead to poor pol-
icy choices, whether it is holding up
the Mobility Fund II proceedings,
which will fund the deployment of
wireless broadband in rural commu-
nities, or rendering inaccurate the
Commission’s recent draft broadband
deployment report, which drastically
overstated deployment in this country
due to lax and faulty data collection
methods.
I fully support this amendment, and I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, the American people
deserve an internet and FCC that
works for them. By supporting this
amendment and requesting an update
regarding form 477 and the data col-
lected thereby from the FCC, Congress
can hold the FCC accountable in their
mission to promote competition, inno-
vation, and most importantly, invest-
ment in broadband services and facili-
ties.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON).
The question was taken; and the Act-

COMMEMORATING NATIONAL CEN-
TER FOR MISSING AND EX-
PLOITED CHILDREN’S 35TH ANNI-
VERSARY
(Mr. COMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the 35th anniversary
of the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children.
For more than three decades, this or-
ganization has assisted families in
their times of greatest need and un-
imaginable pain, and it has assisted
law enforcement agencies with the re-
covery of more than 290,000 missing
children.
Although the Walsh family was the
victim of child abduction with a tragic
ending, their story inspired others and
began a movement to create a coordi-
nated national response to assist fami-
lies like themselves.
The resulting organization has duti-
fully carried out their mission of find-
ing missing children, reducing child
sexual exploitation, and preventing fu-
ture victimization. They achieved
these goals not only by assisting fami-
lies during and after their traumatic
experiences but by providing technical
assistance and resources to law en-
forcement and healthcare profes-
sionals.
I am proud that two vital pieces of
legislation became law during the last
Congress, the CyberTipline Moderniza-
tion Act of 2018 and the Missing Chil-
dren’s Assistance Act of 2018, both of
which strengthened and modernized
programs essential to supporting the
center’s operations.
I join with the staff, partners, and
past and future beneficiaries of the Na-
tional Center for Missing and Exploited
Children in celebrating their 35th anni-
versary.

HONORING JOE BRAMAN
(Mr. CLOUD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Joe Braman, a Refugio
rancher who is recognized internation-
ally for his commitment to protecting
endangered animals from poachers, as
well as aiding law enforcement officers
in protecting our border.
Thanks to meticulous training, Mr.
Braman’s free-running pack dogs as-
sisted with protecting South Africa’s
endangered black and white rhinos, ul-
timately leading to the arrest of 27
poachers and also beginning the recov-
ery of the species.
His dogs can track human scent sev-
eral hours old and take down hunters
more than 20 miles away. They have
proved immensely valuable in Texas as
well. They have assisted local law en-
forcement in manhunts and border se-
curity.
Their 98 percent success rate with lo-
cating and capturing targets dem-
onstrates their potential usefulness in
future border security efforts.
Joe Braman’s unique and incredible
ability to train dogs has made a posi-
tive difference, not just in Texas, but
around the world, and I would like to
extend to him our district’s apprecia-
tion for his excellent work and devo-
tion to justice.

WISHING FIRST LIEUTENANT
JAMES CLAYTON FLOWERS A
HAPPY 103RD BIRTHDAY
(Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor
First Lieutenant James Clayton Flow-
ers and wish him a very happy 103rd
birthday.
Born on Christmas Day in 1915, Mr.
Flowers has seen our great Nation
through a century of progress, conflict,
and change.
Enlisting in the United States Army
Air Forces during World War II, Mr.
Flowers was one of the few African
American soldiers chosen to train as a
Tuskegee Airman.
After World War II, Mr. Flowers
started a family with his wife, Evelyn
Flowers, and began teaching for New
York City public schools, where he was
a leader in the United Federation of
Teachers.
When he and his wife retired, they
found their new home in southern New
Mexico. Even in retirement, Mr. Flow-
ers continued to work for the better-
ment of his community. Leading by ex-
ample, he taught future generations to
serve their communities by building
houses with Habitat for Humanity. He
also invested in the local chapters of
the NAACP and the Alpha Phi Alpha
Fraternity.
Madam Speaker, please join me
today in thanking First Lieutenant
James Clayton Flowers for his service
to our Nation and wishing him a happy
103rd birthday.
f
HONORING SERGEANT DOMINICK
PILLA
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I
am here today to honor an outstanding
member of south Jersey.
Recently in Vineland, New Jersey, we
celebrated the naming of Sergeant
Dominick Pilla Middle School. Ser-
geant Pilla was a brave soul who loved
this country enough to enlist in the
Army to serve to protect it.
Tragically, he was killed while sav-
ing a fellow soldier in Somalia during
the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993 and
was posthumously awarded the Bronze
Star and the Purple Heart.

CALLING FOR VOTE ON DISASTER
FUNDING
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
TORRES SMALL of New Mexico). Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. DUNN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, today, I
join my colleagues in calling for an im-
mediate vote on disaster funding.
In 2018 and so far in 2019, we have wit-
nessed devastating disasters with hur-
ricanes hitting Florida, Georgia, Ala-
bama, and the Carolinas; wildfires in
California; flooding in the Midwest; an
earthquake in Alaska; and several
other widespread weather events that
have harmed communities across our
country and our territories.
The people in our districts and States
need our help, and it is our duty to
fight for them.
I thank my colleagues for joining me
today, and I yield to the gentlewoman
from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY), whose dis-
trict adjoins my district.
Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Florida for leading
this very important conversation here
tonight, and I thank all my colleagues
from our neighboring States and across
this country for keeping this issue in
the forefront of the American people’s
minds.
Over the last several months, Ameri-
cans in many corners of this country
have experienced a devastating loss of
life, property, and livelihood because of
wildfires, flooding, and severe storms. I
am here tonight to express my strong
support for the many Alabamians, both
in the Second District and in neigh-
boring Lee County, who have been
badly impacted by severe weather.
Last October, areas of the Wiregrass
region in Alabama’s Second Congres-
sional District were ravaged when Hur-
ricane Michael made landfall. Barbour,
Dale, Henry, Geneva, and Houston
Counties were the most severely im-
pacted.
Throughout the Southeast, people
lost their loved ones and their homes,
and our farmers were dealt a dev-
astating blow during the middle of har-
vest.
b 1730
This unprecedented disaster resulted
in a tremendous economic setback for
our agriculture community and our
State. Last month, our neighbors in
Lee County faced extreme devastation
when tornadoes touched down. Many
were killed, and many homes were lost
and destroyed.
Madam Speaker, we are here tonight
because these people need help. Here in
Congress, it is our responsibility to
make disaster recovery funds available
now. I implore my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to stop playing polit-
ical games with disaster funding. By
politicizing this humanitarian issue,
we are playing politics with people’s
lives.
We must immediately advance com-
monsense, nonpartisan disaster assist-
ance for the people who have been hit
hardest and are struggling to recover. I
am hopeful that alongside my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle that
a solution will be reached soon. Many
Alabamians—many Americans—are de-
pending on it.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Florida for leading this
discussion.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I wish to
express my gratitude to MARTHA ROBY
for her speech and for her sentiments
on her people in Alabama.
Next, Madam Speaker, I yield to the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN
SCOTT), who is my good friend and who
has been one of the champions for the
disaster supplemental. He has worked
tirelessly for the last 7 months to ad-
vance this effort.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my
colleague, Mr. DUNN, for leading this
effort. I know his district was hit prob-
ably harder than any other district in
the United States.
Madam Speaker, I rise today along-
side many of my fellow colleagues to
again stress the hardships many of our
fellow Americans faced following these
devastating natural disasters of 2018.
On October 10, 2018, Hurricane Mi-
chael entered my home State of Geor-
gia as a Category 3 storm. With it, we
saw widespread damage from dangerous
winds, flooding, and torrential rains.
Hurricane Michael traced a path of de-
struction through south and middle
Georgia, straddling both mine and Con-
gressman SANFORD BISHOP’s districts.
Our districts are largely rural areas
that have also been hit hard by torna-
does and flooding in recent years.
These areas are key to the State’s agri-
culture sector, which is Georgia’s num-
ber one industry.
Madam Speaker, the American farm-
er is the backbone of agriculture, and
agriculture is Georgia’s number one in-
dustry.
Fearing the worst of this storm,
many farmers began harvesting what
they could as Hurricane Michael crept
closer and closer to Georgia. It was the
best yield we had seen in years for
what was gathered before the storm
hit. After years of low commodity
prices, unfair trade practices, labor
shortages, and consecutive years of
devastating storms, we needed it. Once
Hurricane Michael hit, it was all gone.
Not only did we lose billions of dollars
in commodity crops, like cotton and
peanuts, but we also lost orchards and
forests that will take decades to re-
grow.
Since the day after the storm, I have
worked side by side with my friend and
colleague, Congressman BISHOP, in an
effort to bring our communities im-
pacted by Hurricane Michael tools they
need to recover and rebuild. At every
turn, we have worked together to bring
attention to the crisis and to bring re-
lief to these farmers alongside our
other colleagues who have been im-
pacted.
The President and Vice President
personally came down and promised
help. I was there. For months, we have
stressed the magnitude of the damage
to our colleagues, and for months we
were promised this was a priority for
the White House and congressional
leadership from both sides of the aisle.
‘‘Any bill to fund the Government
has disaster relief.’’ I don’t know how
many times I have heard it. I can’t
name all the people I have heard it
from. As we stand here today 6 months
later, these can only be called empty
promises.
Never before have we seen American
communities that were wrecked with
catastrophes neglected like this. To
this day, OMB has not even submitted
a request for disaster assistance, calls
to White House staff have gone
unheeded, and but for one tweet on
April 1, it seems the President has
moved on.
For months I have received calls
from farmers and the lenders they rely
on that the financial impacts from
Hurricane Michael were becoming in-
creasingly more difficult to bear. Then
last week, the Senate showed how
truly ugly and partisan politics have
become, voting down a measure that
would have brought billions in Federal
relief that communities in my home
State of Georgia and around the coun-
try desperately need to get back on
their feet again, money to restore in-
frastructure and restore services, as
well as farm aid.
Certainly, no one would have stood in
the way of disaster relief for States
like Vermont or New York. Rural
Americans, we have been forgotten. We
were forgotten again last week in the
Senate’s failure to pass disaster assist-
ance.
Rural Americans are Americans, too,
whether the press likes it or not, and
whether certain Members of the Senate
like it or not. They need our help to re-
build. If the Senate cannot pass a bill
to provide this Federal disaster assist-
ance, the bottom line is farm bank-
ruptcies will continue, and I fear that
the community banks and businesses
that support the farm sector will too.
The truth is if Hurricane Michael had
hit Americans who aren’t farmers or
farmers who aren’t Americans, the sto-
ries of Washington’s apathy to get
things done would be the front page of
every paper.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3188 April 9, 2019
Mr. Speaker, the American farmers
work day in and day out to feed and
clothe America and the world. I urge
the White House and the Congress to
reverse their course of abandoning our
farmers and keep the promises that
were made to them.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
my good friend, AUSTIN SCOTT, for his
words. He has truly been at the fore-
front on the fight for this disaster sup-
plemental since day one.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Omaha, Nebraska, (Mr.
BACON). General DON BACON is my good
friend and classmate.
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to advocate in support of a dis-
aster assistance package for recent
floods, storms, fires, and others. Last
month, my district and home State of
Nebraska was hit by devastating flood-
ing, destroying more than 2,000 homes,
340 businesses, and taking several lives,
making it the worst natural disaster to
hit the State in our 152-year history.
Many families and communities in
my district have been severely im-
pacted. For several days in March, the
only way in and out of Valley and Wa-
terloo, two towns in our district, was
either by boat or helicopter. Next door
to our district, one-third of Offutt Air
Force Base was under water to include
60 structures.
The economic impact has also been
severe and will hurt the State of Ne-
braska for years to come. Current esti-
mates reveal that the cost of the dam-
age will surpass $1.3 billion to $1.4 bil-
lion. This includes $449 million in dam-
aged roads, levees, and other infra-
structure.
Currently, 200 miles of Nebraska
roads are in need of repair. What once
was a short drive of minutes, in some
cases may take hours, disrupting ev-
eryday commerce and travel.
The Nebraska Department of Agri-
culture estimates that the March
floods will have $400 million in losses
for livestock, $36 million in livestock
feed loss, and $440 million worth of po-
tential crop loss from delayed and pre-
vented planting. Nebraskans are a
strong and resilient people, but they
need to know that we are with them
and will help them through these dif-
ficult times.
While Nebraska has been experi-
encing these horrible floods, I take sol-
ace in our first responders and Na-
tional Guard. I cannot thank these
brave men and women enough for help-
ing so many in our community. In
many small communities across Ne-
braska, first responders are only volun-
teer, often rushing out to help others
while their own homes were in peril.
These heroes selflessly saved countless
lives and property.
I want to give a shout-out to the Wa-
terloo Fire Department volunteers;
they rescued nearly 200 people as vol-
unteers over the course of a week. I
think of the Salvation Army leader
who ran the collection center, working
countless hours while his own home
was underwater.
In these trying times, I urge my col-
leagues to put politics aside and come
together to help Nebraskans and other
Americans hurting from these natural
disasters that have occurred over the
past year. We are Nebraska strong. We
do need that Federal support.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
General BACON for his words.
Madam Speaker, from Nebraska we
have a true leader of the House and a
good friend.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTEN-
BERRY).
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Dr. DUNN for hosting this
very important discussion. As we have
visited on several different occasions, I
want to publicly commend the gen-
tleman for his dedication for fighting
for the right thing to do, for his deep
compassion for the people he rep-
resents and the tireless effort that he
is making to explain the consequences
of Hurricane Michael as it hit him, the
floods that have hit us, and the
wildfires that have hit others. I thank
the gentleman so much for the time
and for his leadership.
Madam Speaker, when spring ap-
proaches in Nebraska, we expect our
rivers and streams to peacefully rise as
snow from the nearby Rockies gently
melts. We are the Cornhusker State,
but we actually could be called the
River State. Here is why: We have
more miles of rivers than any other
State in the Union. The Missouri, the
Platte, the Republican, the Elkhorn,
and the Niobrara are our most famous
rivers, but we really don’t think of
them as threatening—until they are.
So as General BACON just said, this
was the most destructive storm in
most Nebraskans’ lifetimes. A perfect
storm of factors caused the pain and
destruction now all around us. Lands
that were soaked from earlier autumn
rains were frozen solid and then cov-
ered in snow. When the bomb cyclone’s
lethal mix of blizzard and rain did hit
our State, an enormous quantity of
water, ice, and collected topsoil sped
down the hard land like a furious slur-
ry, into rivers, creeks, and reservoirs
bursting through dams, levees, and
other structures that normally would
hold this back.
Madam Speaker, it is pretty hard to
get the mind around what a 500-year
event actually means. But as I was
standing at the ridge on Offutt Air
Force Base, which is located right
south of Omaha near the confluence of
the Platte and Missouri Rivers, I could
see how the unprecedented force of
water covered one-third of that entire
base and many communities in eastern
Nebraska. As the rushing water hit the
bank on the other side of the river, on
the Iowa side, it blew it out and cre-
ated a 62-foot deep hole.
As a member of the Appropriations
Committee here in Congress, I turned
to the commander of the Corps of Engi-
neers who was with me.
I looked at him, and I said: What is
the number?
He immediately shot back without
hesitation and said: It is going to be a
lot.
Now, a little bit down the road to the
west is the town of Fremont. Mayor
Scotty Getzschman is a dedicated local
public servant who is in the heating
and air-conditioning business as his
main job. He brought out a 1940 map of
the old river channel of the Platte
River. The problem for this town of
Fremont began when the river got a bit
nostalgic and sought to go back to its
old ways. In a place now named ground
zero near the Rod and Gun Club west of
town, massive chunks of ice and the
pressure of the Platte blew the levee.
Water began to find its own channels in
multiple breaches, and the southern
part of the town of Fremont endured
serious flooding.
We surveyed the damage from a
freshly patched hole made from rem-
nants of an old hog confinement lot
and riprap from the old Scribner Air
Base.
An initial call for help in the commu-
nity brought 250 people out. Shortly
thereafter, 1,000 people showed up to
sandbag. One man moved his car to
higher ground because he could see
what was coming, but then it was later
swept away by the raging river, and he
spent the next few days at the intersec-
tion directing traffic as a volunteer.
Madam Speaker, a bit west of the
town of Fremont is the small town of
North Bend, and that is where a ditch
dike could not contain itself and made
its own channel, creating fingers of
water flowing throughout the city, and
the vast majority of homes in this
small community were hit. The paved
streets looked like mud streets by the
time I got there, but even with 6 inches
of water inside of it, the North Bend
Eagle, the local newspaper, figured out
a way to get that edition out.
Realizing that he was in a critical
spot, the North Bend school super-
intendent transformed the entire
school, really one of the newer build-
ings, into a center of gravity for emer-
gency operations. Though school was
canceled, it didn’t mean the kids
weren’t busy. Initially they sand-
bagged, then they began to volunteer
for days on end with the cleanup effort.
The people of North Bend organized
themselves, and word spread. Goods
poured in from all over the country.
And as the superintendent told me, he
said that what was happening there
could make a good country song, they
would have so much more appreciation
for Nebraska.
Areas south of the town of Columbus,
a little bit further to the west also
were particularly hard hit with very
large and mounting ag losses, the most
visible sign of which were dead cattle.
In fact, this past Saturday I went to a
high school fundraiser in Columbus,
and along Highway 81 the speed signs
were still bent over with grass at-
tached to them showing the magnitude
and the volume of water that rushed
over that area.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3189
April 9, 2019
There is a truck stop there named T-
Bone, Madam Speaker. It greets pass-
ersby with two enormous cowboy boots
on poles embedded in concrete. One was
found 300 yards away at Matulka’s ga-
rage. The other one was across the
highway about a half mile away. They
will probably be put back up to greet
passersby once again. By the time I got
there, the 4 feet of mud and water had
receded, and a lot had been cleaned up.
I looked at Fred, and I said: How did
this happen?
He said:
At T-Bone’s, we don’t mess around. We are
Nebraskans. We get it done.
On a more positive note, Madam
Speaker, a Federal project initiated
after the last flood of 2011 saved the lit-
tle town of Schuyler, Nebraska, and a
couple of other things positively have
happened. Nebraska’s congressional
delegation asked for expedited federal
disaster assistance, and the President
granted it.
b 1745
Even in the midst of this trauma, Ne-
braskans found a way to get a few
laughs. Along the fence across from
that truck stop of T-Bone’s, there was
a hand-painted sign that said, ‘‘Mud
Wrestling Tomorrow.’’
Back at Offutt Air Force Base, it is a
pretty jarring scene when you see a
large fuel tank lifted up and turned on
its side. It shows you the powerful
force of this water.
As many of the Members of Congress
who have experienced this have had the
same outpouring of support from fam-
ily and friends around the country, I
want to tell you just a quick few things
that happened to me.
A nun from Rome wrote to me and
offered her prayers. A Congressman
from another area of the country
texted me and said: ‘‘I’ll send my staff.
Whatever you need.’’ The Jordanian
Ambassador to the United States con-
tacted me with her concerns.
Madam Speaker, as you and I have
seen firsthand, a natural disaster can
create certain blessings in disguise. It
is a time when we can come together
and put aside any political differences
and lend a helping hand to our fellow
citizens.
I think that is exactly what America
wants Congress to do right now: put
our differences aside, find consensus,
quickly pass a supplemental to simply
help my constituents and the others
who have been so devastated by these
unpredictable, unforeseen events. Many
have waited and waited, and I think
this is the time.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Representative FORTENBERRY for his
compelling description of the damages
that were suffered in Nebraska and also
of the response of those brave people.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. RIGGLEMAN).
Representative DENVER RIGGLEMAN is
my good friend and one of the most
outstanding members of the new class
here in Congress.
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker,
to my colleagues, I rise in support of
them and the incredible work they
have done for disaster relief, and I also
rise today to speak about my district,
the Fifth District of Virginia, which
borders North Carolina, which was dev-
astated last year by two hurricanes,
first Florence and then Michael. The
damage was immense, and the impact
on families was tragic, including the
loss of lives.
This is not an issue I take lightly. In
fact, I pledged to make a donation to
Drakes Branch Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment in Charlotte County, which was
an area the hurricanes hit particularly
hard, actually, with the collapse of the
volunteer fire station back into the
river—and the fact is they had nowhere
to actually do fire emergency work.
Applications for FEMA aid were filed
in Charlotte County, Danville City,
Franklin County, Halifax County,
Lunenburg County, Mecklenburg Coun-
ty, and Prince Edward County. And
many additional counties in my dis-
trict were affected by these hurricanes.
Unfortunately, the effects were not
limited to my district, and the lasting
damage done by these storms lingers in
these communities today. Yes, they are
rebuilding and recovering, but we can-
not ignore the opportunity to prevent
this from happening again.
There are other things we can do not
only with disaster relief and
supplementals, but also working on
issues like I am in the Financial Serv-
ices Committee by addressing issues in
the National Flood Insurance Program.
The NFIP is a necessary Federal
backstop for flood insurance, but sub-
stantially increasing private participa-
tion will help Americans better prepare
for potential future flood emergencies.
I would also like to take this time to
commend the great work done by so
many emergency responders and volun-
teers who helped the communities of
the Fifth District and throughout the
other States and in my colleagues’ dis-
tricts, helped them dig out and move
forward after these hurricanes.
I have visited with many of these
brave men and women who put them-
selves at risk to help their commu-
nities. I commend the strong folks who
make up all of these communities,
linked not only by hurricanes but by
their ability to move on with great re-
silience.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Representative RIGGLEMAN for his
words, and I know that his constitu-
ents are fortunate to have a man of his
rare abilities serving them at all times.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from South Dakota (Mr. JOHN-
SON). Representative DUSTY JOHNSON is
another outstanding member of the
freshman class.
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.
Madam Speaker, I am honored to be a
part of this Special Order tonight.
I want to highlight the dire situation
in my home State of South Dakota.
Our State is just barely beginning to
recover from dramatic flooding while,
simultaneously, we are trying to pre-
pare for the disaster to get worse as a
blizzard this week will dump freezing
rain and more than a foot of snow onto
already saturated ground.
Now, I have heard colleagues talk
about similar and, in some cases, even
more dramatic damage to their homes,
and we have seen, in their States and
in mine, commerce interrupted; we
have seen livelihoods devastated; we
have seen cattle killed; and, worse yet,
we have seen human life lost.
Now, within South Dakota, there
have been many impacted commu-
nities, although perhaps none more
dramatically than Indian Country.
When I have talked to President Bear
Runner, Pine Ridge; President Bor-
deaux, Rosebud; or Chairman Frazier
from Cheyenne River, their texts, their
phone calls, our face-to-face meetings,
they are heavy with the frustration
and the exhaustion, the irritation, the
concern about what is going on for
their people. Madam Speaker, put more
appropriately, they are concerned for
what is going on with our people.
Right before I walked onto the floor
here, I came from a meeting with
Chairman Harold Frazier, and he had
picture after picture after picture,
Madam Speaker, of the devastation
there at Cheyenne River: cemeteries
under water, roads under water, cattle
under water, cars under water.
I know South Dakota is not the only
community that is impacted. Many of
us need a helping hand. Many of the
people in our States are too proud to
ask for a helping hand, but tonight I
would just ask my colleagues in this
body and my colleagues in the Senate
to do everything they can to put poli-
tics aside and to pass a disaster relief
bill that can do much-needed work for
our country.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Representative JOHNSON for his de-
scription, his words, and also for his
granular knowledge of his district. I
know that that is a benefit to every-
body there.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER-
FORD). Sheriff JOHN RUTHERFORD is my
good friend whose district of Jackson-
ville, Florida, abuts mine on the east
side.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I appreciate the gentleman yielding
and giving me the opportunity to speak
about this very important topic im-
pacting our State and our constituents.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to
strongly urge House and, particularly,
Senate leadership to stop turning their
backs on hurricane survivors in my
home State of Florida and pass a dis-
aster supplemental bill before Congress
leaves for the next 2 weeks.
Last October, Hurricane Michael rav-
aged our State, hitting the panhandle
with speeds of up to 155 miles an hour
and killing 49 people. Six months
later—6 months later—families, farm-
ers, and businesses are still waiting for
the assistance that they deserve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3190 April 9, 2019
Families lost homes, precious belong-
ings, things that can never be replaced.
Florida’s timber industry was deci-
mated. The total timber damage is an
estimated 2.8 million acres of timber
that is now lying rotting on the
ground—2.8 million acres.
This is, unquestionably, one of the
worst storms to hit Florida in our long
history.
But not only are Florida agriculture
and other industries desperately await-
ing our help, our national security is
also being impacted. Tyndall Air Force
Base, one of the Nation’s premier mili-
tary installations, was completely de-
molished by this storm.
Since Congress has not passed emer-
gency funding, the Air Force has been
forced to move money from other ac-
counts to help pay for the recovery.
The Air Force is now facing even
tougher choices, like limiting flying
time and construction projects from
other installations.
Madam Speaker, this is simply unac-
ceptable. Maybe if the Senate Demo-
crats would spend less time focused on
running for President and more time
doing the job that they were elected to
do, folks back home would already
have the disaster relief that they are
due.
I voted, along with my House col-
leagues, to pass a supplemental back in
December. In December, we passed
that. The Senate Democrats have just
obstructed that effort.
Entire small communities that were
wiped away still have no assistance
coming from the Federal Government.
I hope the hardworking taxpayers of
Florida remember this lack of concern
when they go to the polls in 2020.
Our Senate is broken by a 60-vote
cloture rule that has to be removed,
and I hope the folks back home will re-
member this in November of 2020.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Sheriff RUTHERFORD for his words. He
has been a stalwart ally and a great
friend ever since we arrived here on
day one. He is a true friend to all of
Florida.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA),
one of the true leaders of our Con-
ference.
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
want to thank my colleague, Mr. DUNN
from Florida, for leading us in this
Special Order tonight and providing
this opportunity to talk about a very
important aspect of our job together as
it affects our different regions and our
States across the country.
This is an important opportunity to
highlight, in my own district, our crit-
ical need for disaster funding in Cali-
fornia, as well as the success stories we
have had in the past, but, also, the
needs of my colleagues in the Southern
States and now, unfortunately, too, in
the Midwest, my colleagues from Ne-
braska.
Unfortunately, it appears that we
will head into a 2-week recess now
without the Senate doing their half of
the job in this Congress and sending a
relief package to the House that is so
desperately needed—a real shame.
This comes after the Senate Demo-
crats rejected the latest attempts by
Republicans to reach a compromise. It
highlights one common trend I have
seen so far in this Congress that Demo-
crats are not interested in good faith
negotiations with Republicans. They
say all or nothing; take it or leave it.
We have got two different Houses.
One has a majority of one and the
other has a majority of the other. We
are going to have to come together a
lot if we are going to get anything done
in this Congress. What we have right
now is no way to govern.
Disasters take a substantial toll on
many areas of the country. In my own
district, 2 years ago was the spillway
disaster at Oroville on the Oroville
Dam. Now, with 2 years of good work,
that spillway is now back functioning
once again, rebuilt with a heck of a lot
of money and a lot of people coordi-
nating to get it done quickly.
We just saw, in the last few days,
25,000 cfs of water is coming over that
spillway in order for the lake to be reg-
ulated safely and accurately for flood
control as well as storing water that
we need through the year.
Unfortunately, that isn’t the last dis-
aster in northern California. We had
two more on top of that: near Redding,
California, what is known as the Carr
fire—a firenado, they labeled it—doing
so much devastation on the west side
there; then, ultimately, in November, 2
days after the election, in Paradise,
California—we have all heard about
that—a whole town basically has dis-
appeared in that fire, in that conflagra-
tion, destroying, again, thousands of
homes and buildings, and dozens of peo-
ple were lost in that.
The Camp fire and the areas around
it—Concow, Magalia—they will be re-
covering for quite some time. Thank-
fully, we have had help, and we are
thankful for that. We are thankful for
the funding for the Oroville Dam spill-
way. We are thankful for the help ini-
tially here for the Carr fire in Redding
and for the Camp fire in Paradise.
But, for all the combined diasters we
are looking at—Mr. SCOTT in Georgia,
who still needs help, and my other col-
leagues—we have to have a stable flow
into the coffers for our disaster relief
that is so desperately needed all over
the country.
Why isn’t the Senate doing its job?
With all that has happened in our home
State of California, why is the junior
Senator from California more worried
about, 2 years ahead of the election,
spending all the time in the other 49
States campaigning instead of showing
up to vote on the relief measure when
the Senate considered it last week and
the House passed a version of it back in
December?
It appears that Senator has more im-
portant things to do. I hope Califor-
nians will remember that for a lot of
reasons.
The Camp fire in Paradise was the
deadliest and most destructive wildfire
in California’s history, the deadliest in
our country for over 100 years.
It is time for the Senate Democrats
to quit fooling around with political
games and get this disaster assistance
in place, not just for me but for all my
colleagues around the country who
have people they are responsible for
and need to get the work done.
We have done our job in the House.
D.C. must do its job overall, the Senate
included.

Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I want
to thank Representative LAMALFA for
his sincere words and his seasoned
judgment and insights. Let us hope
that those words fall on fertile ground.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida’s First District
(Mr. GAETZ), one of my dearest friends
in the House. We were friends for many
years before we came to this House,
and his talents are known to all of us.
He is an Olympian among his class.
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank
Dr. DUNN for the work, not only in rip-
ening this issue, but also in crafting
disaster response legislation that
would work for the people impacted by
Hurricane Michael.
I also want to thank the gentleman
from Georgia, AUSTIN SCOTT. Well be-
fore others were speaking out on this
issue, Dr. DUNN and Mr. SCOTT were
working very hard to ensure that the
needs of our constituents were ade-
quately represented.
Madam Speaker, disasters give us
time to rise to the occasion as leaders
in our community. They give us the
chance to inspire people on their worst
day, and to ensure that those who
carry the disproportionate burden of
challenge will be assisted and helped
by their fellow countrymen and women
in the United States of America.
But sadly, following Hurricane Mi-
chael, we have not, as a Congress, risen
to the occasion, particularly in the
Senate, where there is no movement
now on legislation, before a two-week
recess, to address the terrible tragedy
of Hurricane Michael.
It is unfathomable to me that every
other major storm that has hit our
country, named, has received a disaster
supplemental. And I guess the con-
stituents that I serve, that Dr. DUNN,
that Mr. SCOTT serve wonder, What is
so special about us? What is so dif-
ferent about the people of South Geor-
gia, South Alabama, North Florida,
that we would be left out?
Is it that Hurricane Michael blew at
less of a rate of wind? No. Is it that it
dumped less rain?
I guess it’s just that the people im-
pacted by Michael are unique victims
of a broken system in Washington that
careens from disaster to disaster itself,
rather than focusing on the disasters
impacting our constituents.
And, Madam Speaker, what is so
deeply tragic about this is that as folks

are trying to put their lives, and their
schools, and their families, and their
churches back together, we are moving
into the summer lightning storm sea-
son in my community, and they are
going to be victimized all over again,
because we have got 72 million cubic
tons of fuel on the ground in North
Florida and South Georgia, and South
Alabama, and with the first lightning
storm that is going to ignite.
And so, as my Democrat colleagues,
in a matter of a day or so, prepare for
their retreat, my constituents prepare,
not for a retreat, but for the advance of
fires that will take their homes, their
lives, their farms, their livelihoods,
and their hope for a brighter future.
So I beg, I plead, I implore my col-
leagues, let’s look past the politics of
this moment. Let’s realize that it could
be any of our districts uniquely im-
pacted by a storm, or a fire, or an
earthquake or some other terrible dis-
aster; and that, while on most days, we
wear our jerseys and suit up and com-
pete against one another in the mar-
ketplace of ideas, let’s come together
as one team, as one country, and do
right by those who are suffering from
these terrible tragedies.
Again, I thank my colleague from
Florida for yielding time, and I thank
him for his leadership.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, it is al-
ways a pleasure to introduce Rep-
resentative GAETZ and hear his ora-
tory. I thank him for his brilliant
words.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
ROUZER). Representative ROUZER is a
friend. He has visited my home. I have
visited his district. He truly knows
what it is like to see other districts
and empathize with them and to reach
out; and I am deeply gratified to have
him here speaking today.
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I
want to thank my colleague from Flor-
ida, Representative NEAL DUNN, who is
not only a great colleague but a great
friend.
Madam Speaker, it is not just Hurri-
cane Matthew—pardon me, Hurricane
Michael. In my district we had Hurri-
cane Matthew in 2016—but it is also
Hurricane Florence that devastated
southeastern North Carolina and many
other areas this past fall as well.
A lot of the previous speakers, col-
leagues who have come before me here
today have talked about the need for
disaster assistance, and they are ex-
actly right. I want to complement
what they have said, supplement what
they have said, and paint a little bit of
a broader picture here.
You have got to understand that ag-
riculture, in particular, has faced 5
years of really, really low prices; so
farmers, whether they are in North
Carolina and have suffered from the
flood of Hurricane Florence, or whether
they are in Georgia or Florida or any-
where else and have suffered from Hur-
ricane Michael, or the floods in Ne-
braska, for example, they have no eq-
uity left.
They have suffered 5 years of really,
really low prices. We had a farm bill in
place that, quite honestly, was not ade-
quate in terms of the safety net that
was in place and, as a result, they have
no equity.
And think about this: Think about
all those out there—and for those who
are not involved in agriculture, think
about it this way—assume that you
have invested millions and millions
and millions of dollars that are plowed,
literally plowed into the ground, but
have no opportunity to produce a crop.
You have no equity left. You just
took a loan out from the bank. You are
highly leveraged because of 5 years of
low commodity prices. You have taken
that loan out. This is the one year that
you had available to you to make up
the difference, to begin to turn it
around financially.
And lo and behold, you get hit by
Hurricane Florence, totally flooded
early September, no opportunity to
harvest your crop, and there you are.
That is the scenario. That is the pic-
ture. That is what so many farm fami-
lies all across Eastern North Carolina,
all across the Southeast are facing
today.
Meanwhile, you have got Members of
the House and the Senate who care
very deeply about their constituency,
who have been working very, very hard
to get an ag disaster package, and find
it incredibly frustrating that here, in
April, months after these storms have
hit, we have made no progress. And
there are a variety of reasons for that.
But the fact of the matter is, this
Chamber and the Senate Chamber need
to come together with the White House
to get this ag disaster package done
just as quickly as possible.
In North Carolina, agriculture is an
$87 billion industry, the largest indus-
try, by far.
And let me make one final point.
When these farm families are gone,
when these farms are gone, they are
not coming back; they are growing
houses instead. They are not coming
back.
This agriculture disaster package is
so critically important. We have got to
get it done. I thank the leadership and
the spirit of my good friend from Flor-
ida, NEAL DUNN, and I really, really
commend him and my other colleagues
for putting forward the effort tonight
to raise awareness of this issue. It is so
critically important, not only for my
home State of North Carolina, but for
America.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Representative DAVID ROUZER for those
words. It is a sad story that the gen-
tleman told, but it is a story that need-
ed to be heard and is one that is being
lived out through many of our dis-
tricts; the end of generations of farm-
ing in some families. It is a very sad
story.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN), a
good friend of mine from our class. He
is a great Congressman. We have vis-
ited in his district. And let me say that
it has been a pleasure to work with
him and his wife.
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Dr. DUNN for his work here this evening
to bring attention to something that is
critical for not only our great citizens
in Florida, North Florida, but of course
we heard about North Carolina, Ne-
braska; and, of course, we have been
waiting since last October in Georgia.
You have heard about devastation
from Hurricane Michael. It left a tre-
mendous trail of destruction. It was a
Category 3 storm that reached my dis-
trict with winds over 100 miles per
hour. We lost trees, power lines, crops,
poultry houses, and much more.
While traveling the district, I was
able to see firsthand the heart-wrench-
ing wreckage that Hurricane Michael
left behind, and it is still there to this
day, nearly 6 months later.
Many of our farmers in my district
are struggling to survive. I mean, we
had cotton on the ground, probably the
best harvest we were going to have in
a long time. Gone.
In addition to Hurricane Michael, it
is also important to highlight the need
for the assistance we have been work-
ing to secure for our blueberry and
peach producers in the State who still
suffer from losses and damaged bushes
and trees resulting from late season
freezes.
Not a day goes by that I don’t hear
from a Georgia-12 farmer about the ur-
gency of providing disaster relief fund-
ing immediately.
And just last week, Senate Demo-
crats chose to block a desperately-
needed bipartisan disaster relief pack-
age that would have provided critical
funding to our communities, not only
in Georgia, but across the Nation that
have been affected by these disasters.
Let me just say this: Holding farmers
who feed and clothe our Nation hostage
over partisan politics is downright
shameful.
I cannot stress enough that local
farmers must obtain bank loans ahead
of the upcoming planting season. So
the urgency of getting a bill passed in
both Chambers and sent to the Presi-
dent cannot be overstated. We do not
have time for political games aimed at
undermining our President.
Madam Speaker, agriculture is the
number 1 industry in Georgia and in
the 12th District of Georgia. I know
this process has been more challenging
than many of our farmers could have
imagined, and I just want to reiterate
that I will always stand with rural
America 100 percent.
I will not stop working until the
farmers of the 12th District of Georgia
and across our great State get this dis-
aster relief that they need and deserve.
I would like to thank Senators
PERDUE and ISAKSON for leading the ef-
fort in the Senate, my colleagues AUS-
TIN SCOTT, SANFORD BISHOP, and NEAL
DUNN, and others that you will hear
from here tonight in the House, and all
of my colleagues here this evening for

the commitment to getting this done.
It cannot wait any longer.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I wish to
thank Representative ALLEN for his
words and his support.
Next, I yield to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS), one of the
most senior and experienced represent-
atives in the delegation from Florida, a
man who has been a personal mentor to
me and a great model.
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I
will tell the gentleman this: He has
been a great model for me serving on
the Energy and Commerce Committee.
It is always good to go to the physician
to hear firsthand what the patients
need and want. So I thank the gen-
tleman for healing his constituents
over the years, and now serving them
in the United States Congress.
Madam Speaker, I cannot stress
enough the devastation that hurricanes
over the last few years have inflicted
not only on the State of Florida, but
all over the country, as you can see,
Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, what
have you. And folks, we need to get—
come together. We need to come to-
gether and get this done for the Amer-
ican people.
This should be a no-brainer. We have
waited too long for this to happen, and
it needs to be a bipartisan bill out of
the Senate. Get it on the floor of the
House as soon as possible so we can
help our constituents.
One particular case, in the city of
Tarpon Springs alone, Hurricane Irma
exacerbated shallowing problems at its
port. This puts at risk the livelihood of
our marine and tourism business own-
ers and impacts $250 million in yearly
commerce a year.
A remedy known as the Anclote
River Dredge Project was set to be
funded under the previously-passed
emergency supplemental bill. We were
given assurances—I understand we
have a lot of disasters that need to be
taken care of—but we need to take care
of our constituents, and this is a good
example.
And we did this right. We have coun-
ty matching funds, State matching
funds that are at risk right now. The
city has put up money. We have got to
get this project through.
The seafood industry is suffering.
Again, commerce, the sponge industry
is suffering because of the lack of
dredging of this beautiful Anclote
River.
Unfortunately, the sheer number of
areas in need of repair from disasters
force the already-allocated funding to
be moved to other projects, and I un-
derstand that. But these projects are
important as well.
We need to ensure projects like
Anclote are quickly and adequately
fixed after a hurricane or other dis-
aster; and, therefore, I support the im-
mediate consideration of a disaster
supplemental bill.
I thank my colleague, NEAL DUNN,
for this Special Order. He is doing an
outstanding job.
We have got to get this done quickly
for our constituents.
b 1815
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Representative BILIRAKIS for his lead-
ership and for the personal generosity
of his time spent with me tonight.
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how
much time I have remaining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 11 minutes remaining.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, next, I
would like to introduce the third and
final Representative from Nebraska, a
good friend and a good friend of Ne-
braska. Thank you so much very much
for being here.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam
Speaker, I thank Congressman DUNN
for yielding. I appreciate his taking the
initiative to bring folks together to
discuss, unfortunately, the need to ad-
dress the disasters across America.
Madam Speaker, representing one of
the most rural districts in America, we
have a lot of natural resources, among
them, a lot of rivers, a lot of miles of
river in Nebraska.
Not so long ago, conditions were such
that the rivers flooded in the central
and eastern part of Nebraska. In the
west, a blizzard hit with the bomb cy-
clone, and it created massive damage.
The chunks of ice flowing down rivers
took out a dam, probably the first dam
to break due to ice floes and the
chunks of ice.
It has been tragic. There has been
loss of human life, certainly the loss of
livestock.
The initial estimates are about $400
million in infrastructure damage and
another roughly $1 billion in damage to
crops and livestock.
I appreciate the fact that President
Trump moved quickly on Governor
Ricketts’ request for the disaster dec-
laration.
We are working together among the
Nebraska delegation, both Senators
and all three House Members, to make
sure that we articulate the needs of not
only Nebraskans, but when you remove
agriculture products, as is the case, ul-
timately, consumers will likely be im-
pacted.
This is something we should always
keep in mind because everyone needs
to eat. When we lose the channels of
supply for agriculture products, that is
bound to increase the cost of food.
When you look at the storm, the
bomb cyclone that hit, it probably
couldn’t have happened at a worse time
of year, right in the middle of calving
season.
It is a devastating condition here.
I do appreciate the fact that so many
producers—I talked to one today. In-
stead of a 30-minute commute for a
drive to work, they have to go 95 miles
one way to work, because the bridge is
out. When one bridge is out in rural
Nebraska, that takes a few miles to
make up for that.
I think we are resilient. Ag operators
are resilient, so they are looking up.
But we are concerned that, here in the
next few weeks, in fact, there is an-
other storm forecasted for later this
week where folks are bracing for per-
haps even more damage. Hopefully, we
can get through this.
Again, I appreciate this opportunity
to share what the needs are in Ne-
braska. I will be introducing legisla-
tion to extend a number of tax provi-
sions often provided to disaster areas
to cover this year’s disasters. I hope we
can offer that support to disasters from
last year as well, since we are dis-
cussing this evening multiple disasters
from last year and this year.
Madam Speaker, again, I appreciate
this opportunity.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Representative SMITH for his words. It
speaks to the disaster, what happened
in Nebraska, that all three Representa-
tives showed up.
Madam Speaker, next, I would like to
introduce and yield to the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. YOHO), my good
friend.
We share more in common than most
Representatives. Because of the vagar-
ies of redistricting, we ran in 2016 in
the same 12 counties. He was a great
support, a great example, and cleared
the way for me. I want to say that I am
deeply grateful for having Dr. TED
YOHO here tonight.
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I want
to compliment Dr. DUNN for doing an
awesome job. His leadership on this is
well noticed and well taken by the peo-
ple of his district and all north central
Florida, working together with the
Georgia delegation and other States.
Florida is no stranger to hurricanes.
The year before, we had Hurricane
Irma that went through the whole
State, bypassed the panhandle. In 2018,
we had Michael that hit the panhandle
with virtually a Category 5. It was 2
miles short of Category 5.
The estimated impact for Hurricane
Michael—in fact, it was so severe, be-
fore I get into the impact, we couldn’t
get ahold of Dr. DUNN, so our office was
very concerned about that. We took a
load, with the Gilchrist County Sheriff,
to take supplies up there, looking for
Dr. DUNN. We didn’t know if he had sur-
vived, because nobody had heard. So we
are thankful that Dr. DUNN is here, and
I know his constituents are.
The impact of this went from timber,
cotton, cattle, peanuts, nursery, poul-
try, vegetables, other field crops, dairy,
aquaculture, fruit crops, tree nuts, bee-
keepers, to mention a few. That is no
structures.
The estimated cost just in the pan-
handle of Florida is $1.5 billion.
We heard these other States talking
about agriculture as their largest eco-
nomic driver in that State, their larg-
est industry. Florida is the third larg-
est State in the Union, with 22 million
people. Agriculture is our second larg-
est industry. It is vital.
We look at the past—this is my
fourth term in Congress—and I remem-
ber Hurricane Sandy came, hit the

Northeast. Relief was put out. It was
sent out.
This is something that we need to
come together as Americans. We send
billions of dollars in foreign aid around
the world. It is time for us to look in-
ternally, fix our problems here, because
the expense of these storms, they accu-
mulate. They don’t go away from one
year to the next, and we are going into
the next season, the next fire season.
This is something we need to work
now, to correct these things.
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the
leadership of Dr. DUNN.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, let me
say that I am deeply indebted to Dr.
YOHO. Our channel of communications
went down after the storm in a way
that America has never seen. We lost
cellphones, landlines. We lost police ra-
dios. We were talking to each other by
ham radios and runners.
When Dr. YOHO could not raise me or
my office staff, he mounted a rescue
operation complete with food and sup-
plies and took care of the east end of
my district. I will always be grateful to
Dr. YOHO for that, and I thank him so
much.
Madam Speaker, for my final guest, I
would like to introduce the Represent-
ative from south Georgia, another good
friend and a neighbor. We don’t quite
abut districts, but we come pretty
close. I spend a lot of time in his neigh-
borhood. He needs to spend more time
down on my beaches.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER).
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. DUNN
for the work that he has done, as well
as my other colleagues, Representative
AUSTIN SCOTT, Representative SANFORD
BISHOP, and Representative MARTHA
ROBY. All of these fine legislators have
worked diligently on this, and I thank
them for their efforts, as well as oth-
ers.
Madam Speaker, I have the honor
and the privilege of representing the
First Congressional District of Geor-
gia. The First Congressional District of
Georgia includes the entire coast of
Georgia, over 100 miles of coastline. We
have a lot to be thankful for, a lot to
be proud of. We have two major sea-
ports and four military installations,
Moody Air Force Base, Kings Bay
Naval Base, Fort Stewart, and Hunter
Army Airfield. We have the Federal
Law Enforcement Training Center. We
have two Coast Guard stations, one in
Savannah and one in Brunswick.
We have so much to be thankful for,
but we also have a very strong agri-
culture community, particularly in the
western portion of our district. It is
very, very important.
Madam Speaker, much of the State
of Georgia is in need right now, and
they can’t wait any longer.
In the First Congressional District of
Georgia over the past few years, we
have had hurricanes. We had Hurricane
Matthew, Hurricane Irma, and Hurri-
cane Michael. We have had fires. We
had the West Mims Fire. We have had
freezes and harsh freezing conditions
that impacted our agriculture commu-
nity.
These disasters have been detri-
mental to agriculture in Georgia. By
the way, agriculture in Georgia is our
largest industry. That is very impor-
tant and very important for the First
District.
In fact, just to be specific, blue-
berries, which are the leading fruit now
in the State of Georgia, blueberries
alone make up a $1 billion industry.
That is ‘‘billion’’ with a B, a $1 billion
industry. Those farmers are the back-
bones of their communities.
Blueberry farmers, in some areas,
their crops make up 30 percent of the
portfolios of banks. That is significant
to these communities, and we simply
cannot allow these farmers to continue
going without this assistance.
The banks are waiting for many of
these farmers to repay their loans. It is
putting them in jeopardy of not being
able to farm next year and putting en-
tire rural economies at risk. When you
put 30 percent of your portfolio at risk,
you are putting your community at
risk.
Congressional inaction on this is ab-
solutely unacceptable.
The Senate’s failure to pass disaster
aid last week was one of the worst mo-
ments that I have experienced in Wash-
ington since I have come to Congress.
These people need assistance, Madam
Speaker. They need assistance. We
need to help them. The American farm-
er feeds the world. Georgia farmers are
an integral part of this. Blueberries are
an important crop in our district. Agri-
culture is the number one industry in
Georgia.
It is time for us to respond to this.
This is what we are to do as Members
of Congress. We cannot simply ignore
this. It will not go away.
We need these farmers. They need
our help, and we need to respond.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all my
colleagues to support disaster aid.
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I thank
my good friend, Representative CAR-
TER, for his impassioned words. Obvi-
ously, he is echoing thoughts that we
have heard from the other speakers.
Seldom has a Special Order been so
well subscribed. So many people came
to speak, so many people moved and
hurt by the disaster.
It leaves me with very little time,
but I want to say a couple things.
I want to reiterate that this is an un-
precedented event for timber. Nobody
has ever seen this much timber on the
ground, 3 million acres of timber.
Think about what that does to the for-
esters, the loggers, and the sawmills.
The military, we have lost an Air
Force base, probably $4 billion to $6 bil-
lion worth of damage to that. We will
rebuild it. We will rebuild it, and it will
be great, but we need help from Con-
gress to do that.
I have a Navy base in my district,
$288 million in damage.
I have a Coast Guard base in my dis-
trict that is particularly sad. They
have a single building standing. They
were victims of the storm; they were
first responders to the storm. They
were not paid, because they are with
the Department of Homeland Security,
for a month. It is shameful. These are
fine people in the Coast Guard.
We have housing problems right now.
Thirty percent of the homes in my
home county is uninhabitable. Fifty
percent of the commercial real estate
is not usable.
We have special geography. We are
100 miles away from the next place
where there is multifamily housing. We
need housing on the ground in the af-
fected areas.
Madam Speaker, I thank all the peo-
ple who took time to come and tell our
story, which is a sad story, and I urge
the Congress to come to our rescue.
That picture, by the way, is not 6
months old. It is 2 weeks old.

Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I
thank the freshman class for giving me
the opportunity to take a few seconds
here.
Madam Speaker, I wish to recognize
Brigadier General Thomas Kunkel
upon his departure as Chief, Air Force
Legislative Liaison to the U.S. House
of Representatives.
In this role, General Kunkel managed
the Air Force interaction with Mem-
bers of Congress and their staffs in sup-
port of the Air Force programs and
congressional oversight and travel.
He served as the Air Force’s senior
escort for staff and congressional dele-
gations, traveling to more than 20

pararescuemen at Moody Air Force
Base, Georgia; Davis-Monthan Air
Force Base, Arizona; and Nellis Air
Force Base, Nevada; and oversight of
Avon Park aerial gunnery range, Flor-
ida.
General Kunkel received his commis-
sion in 1994 from the University of
Texas, Arlington. He has served in the
Air Force Special Operations and the
Combat Air Forces as an HH–60G spe-
cial operations and rescue pilot, flight
examiner, and weapons officer. He has
deployed in support of operations Al-
lied Force, Enduring Freedom-Phil-
ippines, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi
Freedom. During his time serving in
operation Allied Force, then Captain
Kunkel was the pilot in command who
rescued the now Chief of Staff of the
Air Force, General David Goldfein,
whose aircraft had been downed by an
enemy surface-to-air missile in Serbia.
General Kunkel has also served on the
Air Staff as Program Element Monitor
for helicopter sustainment and acquisi-
tions.
He is married to Jennifer and has
three children—Avery, Noah, and
Griff—who have supported him and his
career.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the U.S.
Congress and a grateful Nation, I ex-
tend our deepest appreciation to Briga-
dier General Thomas E. Kunkel for his
dedicated service to the U.S. House of
Representatives and to our Nation. We
wish him well as he moves on to his
next role at the National Military
Command Center at the Pentagon.
There is no question that the Air
Force, the Department of Defense, the
United States, and all of us have bene-
fited greatly from his service.
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, we
are here today to recognize the accom-
plishments of the freshman class of the
116th Congress as we approach the
100th day since we were sworn into of-
fice. History is before us. Congress is
230 years old.
As co-president of the freshman
class, alongside my colleague, Rep-
resentative COLIN ALLRED of Texas, we
ring with a dutiful pride, deeply hum-
bled by this opportunity to serve in a
legislative session that will mark the
conclusion of a decade and the begin-
ning of another. We take stock of new
representation, new voices, people,
that the likes of this body have never
seen before, what the American people
called for in their voting booth, and all
that this great body represents.
This class of freshman Democrats, 67
Members strong, from every corner of
our great Nation, is the largest in near-
ly 45 years. Our class represents several
historic firsts. With 42 new women in
Congress, the House of Representatives
is more female than at any point in the
Chamber’s deep history.
Representative DAVIDS of Kansas and
Representative HAALAND of New Mex-
ico are the first Native American
women to serve in this Chamber.
Representative OMAR of Minnesota
and my fellow Michigander, Represent-
ative TLAIB, are the first Muslim
women in Congress.
We now have more African American
women and men serving in this body
than ever before.
Nearly two-dozen new Members, from
both sides of the aisle, have served our
country as members of the military or
Central Intelligence Agency.
Representative OCASIO-CORTEZ of
New York is the youngest woman to
ever serve in the House, and Represent-
ative FINKENAUER of Iowa is the second
youngest.
Representative VAN DREW of New
Jersey is a dentist.
Representative SCHRIER of Wash-
ington is a pediatrician.
Representative UNDERWOOD of Illinois
is a nurse.
Representative HAYES of Connecticut
was the Teacher of the Year.
And Representative SHALALA of Flor-
ida, the longest serving health and
human services secretary in history.
Representative MUCARSEL-POWELL,
also of Florida, is the first South
American immigrant Member of Con-
gress.
This freshman class brings its bril-
liant diversity, experience, and unity, a
broad array of skills and life experi-
ence, to the Halls of Congress, gener-
ating a commitment to address legacy
issues and usher in opportunities for
the common good to promote the gen-
eral welfare for all American people.
President Lincoln’s words bear down
on us. He, who was once a Member of
this very body, said: ‘‘Fellow citizens,
we cannot escape history. We of this
Congress and this administration, will
be remembered in spite of ourselves. No
personal significance, or insignificance,
can spare one or another of us. The
fiery trial through which we pass, will
light us down, in honor or dishonor, to
the latest generation.’’
The issues of today are complex,
enormous, and often frustrating, but
we do not bemoan. We bring a commit-
ment to serve, to problem solve, and
create opportunity. We are reminded
that this very body saw us through
western expansion to become a land of
sea to shining sea, through pain, by the
way. And we did reconstruction fol-
lowing a brutal Civil War.
And now, in the year 2019, in the first
100 days of the 116th Congress, we have
been hard at work. We have passed the
For the People Act, a historic bill to
clean up corruption and restore ethics
in Washington, putting voters at the
center of elections.
We passed the Paycheck Fairness
Act, to finally fulfill gender economic
equality in the workplace and bring
more people into the middle class.
We passed a universal background
check bill, to keep firearms out of the
hands of those who seek to do evil, and
we will do more commonsense gun
safety legislation to put the safety of
all communities at the top of the pri-
ority list.
We have held hearings, long overdue,
on climate change and outrageous pre-
scription drug prices, on Government
oversight on human rights abuses at
our border, and we have led on matters
of safety and security.
And we are evaluating all the ways
to meet our country’s infrastructure
needs.
We, the people, for the people, a
country in a new moment.
As a representative from the great
State of Michigan, I have been privi-
leged to introduce my first piece of leg-
islation, the bipartisan Building Blocks
of STEM Act, which promotes STEM
education and pathways to education
in the sciences, particularly for young
girls.
As the chairwoman of the Research
and Technology Subcommittee, I have
had the opportunity to preside over
hearings on bioengineering and ad-
vanced manufacturing, essential to re-
gional economic development, particu-
larly in places like southeastern Michi-
gan.
I passed a bipartisan amendment to
the Rebuilding America’s Schools Act
and led an effort to maintain funding
for advanced technological educational
training programs, an important ini-
tiative with active grants in my dis-
trict.
This was all in the first 100 days:
multiple townhalls, coffee hours, and
Manufacturing Mondays.
The question before us, the Moon
shot of 2015, what will usher in new sci-
entific advancements in the workforce
to help us achieve them? It is for those
who dare to create a vision.
There are 18 freshmen currently serv-
ing as subcommittee chairs, holding in-
formative hearings and driving impor-
tant policy discussions on issues like
veterans’ healthcare, small business
advocacy, trade assistance, and for jus-
tice and equality, for the individual
hardworking Americans residing and
fueling the energy in the towns
throughout suburban metro Detroit,
where I represent, and their young
children dreaming of their future. They
are eagerly, and sometimes quietly,
counting on us to wage great discus-
sion, to think deeply and penetrat-
ingly, to seize the duty at hand.
Congress often feels like being on a
great ship, each side weighing side to
side, sometimes in stormy weather, but
we have all taken the oath to reside on
this ship, to come together for the re-
mainder of our service, to improve the
outcomes for the next generation and
for those to come, the whispers of time
and time.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ALLRED).
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, this
new freshman class has made history
as the youngest and most diverse ever,
and I am incredibly proud to be a Mem-
ber of this class and of this Congress
and to serve with my friend, Represent-
ative STEVENS, as freshman class co-
president of the Democratic class.
We truly do represent our Nation’s
slogan of E pluribus unum—out of

many, one. And though we have much
more work to do as the end of our first
100 days approaches, we have made real
progress in fulfilling our efforts to
make the lives of ordinary Americans a
little bit better.
As freshman class co-president, I can
tell you that this class came here with
a mandate to end the sabotage of
Americans’ healthcare and to work to
lower costs. I was proud to lead the ef-
fort, on our very first day in Congress,
as we placed the United States House
back on the side of the people by inter-
vening to defend the Affordable Care
Act in court and with it its protections
for people with preexisting conditions.
This resolution, that I was proud to
lead, passed with bipartisan support,
sending a strong message that the
United States House will not stand idly
by while this administration tries to
take us back to the bad old days when
people were denied care because they
had a preexisting condition or ran into
lifetime caps on their coverage.
We have also introduced bold legisla-
tion that will stop the sabotage, sta-
bilize healthcare markets, and lower
costs for regular folks, that I hope will
pass with bipartisan support. After all,
that is what the American people want
us to do, to work together.
We have also passed commonsense
gun safety measures that will keep our
communities safe by closing loopholes
in the background check system.
We passed the Paycheck Fairness
Act, which helps guarantee that, no
matter who you are, everyone gets
equal pay for equal work.
We passed the most historic
anticorruption and pro-democracy bill
in a generation, H.R. 1, the For the
People Act, which will reduce the in-
fluence of big money and special inter-
ests in Washington and return power to
the people by expanding voting rights
and ending voter suppression.
From my post on the Transportation
and Infrastructure Committee, we are
laying the groundwork for a much-
needed and long overdue infrastructure
bill. In my district in north Texas, we
are rapidly growing, and I know that I
am not alone in hearing from folks who
are stuck in traffic and tired of conges-
tion on their commutes, and we can
and must do more to repair our roads
and bridges and to diversify the trans-
portation options available to all
Americans.
In closing, I issue this challenge to
my colleagues in both parties, in the
House and in the Senate. The American
people are counting on us. Let’s put
aside partisan politics and let’s work
together. From prescription drugs to
infrastructure, there is so much that
we agree on. Let’s deliver in the next
100 days for the American people.
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentlewoman from New
Mexico (Ms. HAALAND).
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, if
we think back to the beginning of this
Congress, we started the first 100 days
under an unnecessary government
shutdown. I met with constituents,
Federal workers, and businessowners in
my district who were forced to suffer
for the President’s frivolous campaign
promise.
At the end of the day, we funded the
government and made sure Federal
workers received back pay. All the
while, we were setting up a path to
work for the people, making our com-
munities a priority, not just the
wealthy and well connected, but people
who suffer when they lose a paycheck
and need to rely on accessible
healthcare.
We are in a special moment in his-
tory, a moment when our freshman
class of House Members look more like
the people we represent, and our expe-
riences reflect the experiences of ev-
eryday Americans. I am a single moth-
er. I often had to piece together
healthcare for my daughter and I, and
I am still paying off my student loans.
This class of freshman lawmakers
know the struggles that many are
going through, and, with our new ma-
jority, it is clear we are working for
the people.
b 1845
We passed the bill that would ensure
everyone has an opportunity to partici-
pate in our democracy, while taking
steps to end corruption.
The most significant land legislation
of our time made it across the finish
line, including provisions of my first
bill, to designate land for everyone to
have access to public lands in New
Mexico.
It was a huge win for my State, be-
cause in New Mexico we value our nat-
ural heritage and resources, and we be-
lieve in protecting the places we hold
dear for future generations to enjoy.
The public lands package makes all
of those things possible. It is also a
prime example of what our Democratic
majority can get done because we are
willing to work across the aisle and
push legislation through.
Our progress includes things like
fighting for equality with the Pay-
check Fairness Act and a resolution
condemning the President’s
transgender troops ban, fighting for
prosperity for everyone by introducing
a $15 minimum wage and passing the
Dream and Promise Act.
We are also tackling the challenges
of our time with the Violence Against
Women Act and forging a path to ad-
dress climate change with an unprece-
dented number of committee hearings
uncovering the climate change reali-
ties facing our communities, and we
are working on legislation that will
create a Green New Deal for everyone
and for our country.
In 100 days, you can get a lot done,
and we are looking forward to getting
more done for the people in the next
100 days.
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, we
are so proud of our freshman class.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA),
someone whom her constituents know
as ‘‘Senator SYLVIA’’ from her great
service in her State’s capitol, but
whom we knew as the great Congress-
woman from Texas.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman from
Michigan.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to com-
memorate the first 100 days of the
116th Congress. In this short amount of
time, Madam Speaker, a lot has surely
happened.
At our swearing in, the Congress be-
came the most diverse on record, in-
cluding 42 freshman women. And with
one in five Members of Congress being
people of color, we have come a long
way, baby.
As our Representatives in Congress
begin to look more like the commu-
nities we represent, our legislative pri-
orities also more closely reflect the
will of the people.
Our citizens have sent a message loud
and clear that Congress should be giv-
ing a voice to our families on Main
Street and not to the rich and the
wealthy on Wall Street. As a result, we
have been focused on passing
groundbreaking legislation that pro-
tects our democracy, expands our civil
liberties, provides for a stronger na-
tional security, and boosts our econ-
omy, all while staying true to our val-
ues.
Passage of H.R. 1, the For the People
Act, is the largest, most sweeping elec-
tion reform and campaign finance re-
form bill to pass the House in our Na-
tion’s history.
It also significantly protects access
to the ballot box for every American; it
will shed light on the corrupting influ-
ence of dark money in our campaign fi-
nance system; and, finally, it will re-
turn the voices of working-class Ameri-
cans to our democracy. And the best
part: election day would be a holiday.
We are upholding the promise of
equal protection under the law for our
citizens. With the Equality Act, we are
finally providing explicit protections
to the LGBTQ community, finally
making them equal under the eyes of
the law.
We are keeping our promise to
women as well. With the introduction
of the Paycheck Fairness Act, we are
finally taking steps to close the wage
gap, where women in Texas still make
only 79 cents for every dollar a man
makes, and 44 cents if you are His-
panic.
With the Violence Against Women
Reauthorization Act, we are upholding
our sacred duty to protect the millions
of Texas women who experience vio-
lence and domestic abuse every year.
Perhaps most importantly for my
district, we have finally introduced the
Dream and Promise Act, which will
provide protections for immigrants
who, in their hearts, are often as Amer-
ican as myself and anyone else on this
House floor.
These young men and women—about
113,100 in my district—whom we call

family, friends, and colleagues, will be
able to continue working hard in their
communities and contributing to our
economy—nearly $50 billion a year, by
the way—without fear of being sepa-
rated from their families.
Unfortunately, during our 100 days,
the Trump administration’s top pri-
ority has proven not to be for the peo-
ple. The administration’s recent budget
proposal included deep cuts to Medi-
care, Medicaid, and the SNAP assist-
ance program, all of this to pay for the
radical GOP tax cuts which they have
made on the backs of working people,
veterans, and seniors.
After the eventual passage of the bi-
partisan budget without funding for a
border wall, this administration de-
cided to create a completely avoidable
but devastating government shutdown.
The 26-day shutdown cost families real
money and opportunity, maybe more
than 800,000 workers without a pay-
check during that time.
Since then, we have seen an illegal
national emergency declaration that
seeks to take funding from vital na-
tional security needs to build the
President’s border wall.
We are also now hearing threats of
another shutdown, this time shutting
down the border completely. This is
wrong and downright reckless. Trade
through our southern border accounts
for $1.7 billion per day and would hurt
our Texas economy.
And, finally, the Trump administra-
tion is trying once again to take our
healthcare system, this time through
the courts. This move could leave up to
53 million non-elderly Americans with
preexisting conditions without access
to healthcare—320,000 in my district.
This is cruel; it is immoral; and it is
just plain wrong.
It should be clear that our work is
not done.
I am proud to be a Member of the ma-
jority that will fight for the people, de-
fend our democracy, protect access to
quality, affordable healthcare, and do
so with justice and decency.
Madam Speaker, we have accom-
plished so much in these first 100 days,
but we must make sure that the Amer-
ican people know that we are resound-
ingly focused on real solutions that
will actually keep our border safe, help
our businesses, and uphold our Amer-
ican values.
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. WILD), my friend.
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I am so
proud to rise today as part of this won-
derful, diverse, strong, and vibrant
freshman class.
As we mark the 100 first days of the
116th Congress, it has been a busy time,
to say the least. In our first days of
this 116th Congress, I have met with
more than 150 constituents. I have held
five townhalls and question-and-answer
events and visited 17 local businesses
and 10 local schools.
I have met with educators and labor
leaders, health workers, business lead-
ers, manufacturers, students, and sen-
ior citizens.
I have heard the same messages from
constituents of all backgrounds
throughout Pennsylvania’s Seventh
District:
Build an economy that delivers for
working and middle-class people;
Protect benefits like Medicare and
Social Security that we have earned;
Defend the rights and dignity of all
people;
Work across the aisle on urgent pri-
orities, like protecting our commu-
nities from gun violence, combating
the opioid epidemic, and protecting the
environment; and
Fight to ensure that the next genera-
tion doesn’t have a lower standard of
living than its parents.
These messages have driven and
shaped my work, particularly as a
Member of the Education and Labor
Committee, where we have been work-
ing on legislation to raise the min-
imum wage, make workplaces safer for
working Pennsylvanians and all Ameri-
cans, help students saddled with stu-
dent loan debt, and make higher edu-
cation more inclusive and affordable.
I am so proud of everything we are
doing in the Education and Labor Com-
mittee to build an economy and edu-
cation system that lifts all workers, all
students, all Pennsylvanians, and all
Americans. I am also proud that I am
keeping my promises to my constitu-
ents.
My promise to work to improve our
healthcare system, lower healthcare
costs, and protect people with pre-
existing conditions led me to introduce
my own bill as part of a larger effort to
improve the Affordable Care Act—the
Family Healthcare Affordability Act—
to fix the ACA family glitch, an issue
that has prevented some workers from
being able to extend their employer-
provided insurance to their families.
My bill is a small fix to a big problem
for many working families.
I also committed to my constituents
that I would work to reform our gov-
ernment, reduce the influence of
money in politics, and ensure that
every American has a voice in our de-
mocracy. We kept that commitment
when we passed H.R. 1, a landmark
government reform package that in-
cluded my bill to enact early voting
across the country. In Pennsylvania,
we don’t have early voting, and that
hurts working and lower income people
who often have far less time and flexi-
bility to get to the polls.
This has been a productive 100 days,
but people in my community and
across the country are counting on us
to do so much more. They are also
counting on the Senate and the White
House to do their part so that the leg-
islation we are passing gets signed into
law.
In these next 100 days, I will continue
working to bring about a more just,
more equal future across our commu-
nity, and I will continue doing every-
thing I can to make the people of the
Seventh District proud.
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentleman from Michigan
(Mr. LEVIN), my friend and fellow
Michigander.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Speaker, I thank Congresswoman STE-
VENS, and it is so great to go after Con-
gresswoman WILD.
The first thing I want to say is what
a great time I am having with you all,
how much I am learning from you, how
much fun we are having working on
things together.
Congresswoman WILD and I are par-
ticularly concerned that any new re-
placement for NAFTA really protects
the working people of our country,
really protects our environment, and
does not subject people to outrageously
high prices for prescription drugs.
As I look about me and see the other
Members here, I see others whom I am
working with on different things, and I
think that is the great thing about this
new freshman class. I am really so
proud to be a part of this freshman
class of the 116th Congress, and I feel
like we have really had an outstanding
first 100 days fighting for the people.
Right out of the gate, we are deliv-
ering on our promises to pass bold,
transformative legislation and conduct
essential oversight that the Constitu-
tion demands of us.
Voting on final passage of H.R. 1, the
For the People Act, was certainly one
of my proudest days.
My Transparency and Corporate Po-
litical Spending Act is in the final
version of the bill, and it will increase
transparency for big corporations that
dump dark money into our elections.
My amendment to Whip CLYBURN’s
gun violence prevention bill to close
the Charleston loophole will require
the Government Accountability Office
to report on gun violence prevention
methods so that we have the best infor-
mation available while crafting policy.
I think it is so important that we bring
back research to this public health cri-
sis of gun violence.
Just last week, so many colleagues
joined me in calling on the Department
of Homeland Security and Immigration
and Customs Enforcement to halt the
cruel and unjust detention and depor-
tation of Iraqi nationals, many of
whom are Chaldean Christians and
other religious minorities.
My district, the Ninth District of
Michigan, has the most Iraqi nationals
of any district in the country, out of
435. But I think, Congresswoman STE-
VENS, 9 out of the 10 districts with the
most Iraqi nationals, those Representa-
tives join me—I think, 23 altogether—
in calling on our government to respect
the rights of these people to just have
their day in court.
I came to Congress on a mission to
raise the standard of living for working
people, and the Democratic majority
has delivered on that promise in sev-
eral ways already, from passing legisla-
tion to reduce the cost of healthcare to
passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, to
guaranteeing women get equal pay for
equal work.

I commend my colleagues in the ma-

for their hard work, fearlessness, and
dedication that has gotten us this far,
and we have only just begun.
I yield back to my sister Michi-
gander, the gentlewoman from Roch-
ester Hills, Ms. STEVENS.
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman, and I yield to the
gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms.
KENDRA S. HORN), my dear friend.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman STEVENS for yielding to me.
I am honored to rise this evening to
talk about our accomplishments in the
first 100 days. As a Representative of
Oklahoma and Oklahoma’s Fifth Con-
gressional District, I talked to people
all across my district about what is im-
portant to them, about what is para-
mount, and above and beyond every-
thing else, the thing I heard from peo-
ple across my district is that people
need a voice. That is exactly what we
have done in this first 100 days.
From day one, I have said and will
continue to say and advocate for the
people of Oklahoma in the Fifth Con-
gressional District that their voice is
number one.
Throughout this time, we have
prioritized commonsense solutions for
the people of Oklahoma, legislation
and actions that help to improve the
lives of everyday individuals. I have
shown that with the time I have spent
back in my district talking to and lis-
tening to the people there.
In order to hear from as many people
as possible, we have held eight public
events, or townhalls, ranging from cof-
fee meetings to large townhall gath-
erings. From Seminole to Oklahoma
City, from Oklahoma City Community
College to diners, in both Oklahoma
and Washington, D.C., I have met with
more than 2,300 Oklahomans over the
course of more than 200 meetings.
In response to inquiries from folks
back home, I have replied to thousands
of calls, letters, emails, and text mes-
sages about issues that are most im-
portant to them. Over and over I have
heard: We need a voice.
So I have cosponsored 28 pieces of bi-
partisan legislation ranging from en-
suring that the Indian Health Service
is funded to increasing transparency in
politics with the passage of H.R. 1, to
ensuring that those individuals have
that voice.
When we came in in the middle of a,
sadly, historic shutdown, I spoke up for
the members of the FAA and our Fed-
eral employees, including our air traf-
fic controllers, because we should never
play politics with people’s lives. No
family should have to endure the hard-
ships caused by partisan political
games.
I cosponsored legislation; that is the
Shutdown to End All Shutdowns Act.
And beyond that, we stood up for pay-
check fairness and for wage equality,
which is not just a women’s issue. This
is an issue that impacts our families
and our communities and our overall
quality of life.
I have spoken up for education and
ensuring that everyone has access to
quality, available healthcare. That in-
cludes protecting people with pre-
existing conditions, lifetime caps, and
working, as we will continue to do, to
make prescription drugs more afford-
able.
As a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, I have been a
vocal advocate for our servicemen and
-women who have, sadly, had to deal
with substandard housing.
I have spoken up for the security of
our Nation, but also for respect for
every single individual in our district.
And in an effort to stay in touch with
all corners of the district, I have
toured some of our most critical facili-
ties, from Tinker Air Force Base to the
Palomar Family Justice Center and
the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma,
and so many more.
I have spoken with some of our most
vital organizations, like the VFW, the
Black Chamber of Commerce, the Farm
Bureau, education and healthcare ad-
vocates, as well as local elected lead-
ers, about priorities in our commu-
nities.
I have even had the privilege of show-
ing a sheep at the Oklahoma Youth
Expo, the largest youth expo in the Na-
tion.
I am proud of what we have accom-
plished so far, and I am especially
proud to serve with this historic fresh-
man class. I look forward to what we
accomplish moving forward and to
being an independent voice for Oklaho-
mans.
We have only begun, and I look for-
ward to what we can accomplish in the
next 100 days and the next 100 days
after that to put the people first.
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congresswoman HORN for show-
ing us what leadership looks like.
It should also be noted that our pre-
siding Speaker this evening, Ms.
XOCHITL TORRES SMALL, the Congress-
woman from the great State of New
Mexico, is also a member of our fresh-
man class.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE),
my friend.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
I would like to engage in a colloquy
of sorts with my fellow colleague in
House leadership, a Representative of
the freshman class, Representative
HILL, and, of course, our co-class presi-
dent, Representative STEVENS.
Representative HILL, what do you
think about the freshman class?
Ms. HILL of California. Mr. NEGUSE,
I am pretty excited to be here today
because we get to brag a little, and I
get a little tired with bragging about
myself. I think that is something we do
a lot as a Member of Congress, and
today we get to brag about our friends.
Mr. NEGUSE. I couldn’t agree more,
Representative HILL.
Representative STEVENS, what do you
think about the freshman class?
Ms. STEVENS. Well, I am delighted
to be among the freshman class, and I
am so proud of all of our accomplish-
ments, particularly that we have 18
freshmen chairing subcommittees from
all of the various great committees,
the Committee on Science, Space, and
Technology, the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee, and the Small Business Com-
mittee.
Mr. NEGUSE. Well, I couldn’t agree
more, and I want to associate myself
with the remarks of Representative
STEVENS and Representative HILL.
We have got an incredible freshman
class in this 116th Congress. Not only is
it the youngest and most diverse in
history, but we got straight to work.
We hit the ground running.
At the end of the day, this freshman
class is making a lot of progress, so I
would like to give the American people
a sense of what the freshman class has
been up to.
Over the last two recesses, the fresh-
man class has held over 100 townhalls
and over 400 events. That is a lot of
events, Representative HILL.
Ms. HILL of California. That is a lot
of events, and if you recall, the col-
leagues that many of us replaced, the
former colleagues that many of us re-
placed, were criticized for not having
townhalls. But, in fact, during the Feb-
ruary recess alone, freshman Members
made up 51 percent of the Members of
Congress holding townhalls, even
though we make up just 18 percent of
Congress.
Mr. NEGUSE. That is right. Con-
gressman ANDY KIM from the great
State of New Jersey has held more
townhalls in the last 3 months than his
predecessor did over the last 4 years,
and he has responded to over 5,000 let-
ters from constituents—quite a feat.
Ms. HILL of California. Five thou-
sand letters is a lot of letters.
Congressman DEAN PHILLIPS actually
started holding townhalls before he
was even sworn in.
Mr. NEGUSE. Well, let me tell you
about my friend, Congressman ANTONIO
DELGADO, who has held six townhalls
over the first in-district work period.
Ms. HILL of California. At her first
townhall in Virginia Beach, Congress-
woman ELAINE LURIA, whom I am
proud to sit on the Armed Services
Committee with, brought the Beach’s
voter registrar and police chief, the
head of its affordable housing efforts,
and one of the State delegates with her
and heard from more 250 people who
were attending.
Mr. NEGUSE. Clearly, this freshman
class is making townhalls the rule and
not the exception. But the freshman
class is also taking great care to talk
about the issues that really matter to
their constituents.
Ms. HILL of California. That is abso-
lutely right. Congressman BRINDISI’s
Working for Rural New York plan fo-
cuses on solving problems rural com-
munities face in his district.

Mr. NEGUSE. Let me tell you about
my friend Congresswoman ANGIE CRAIG
from the great State of Minnesota, who
held a flood briefing to start discus-
sions around different agencies work-
ing together in the case of major flood-
ing.
Ms. HILL of California. Well, let me
tell you about my friend JOSH HARDER
from the great State of California, who
is fighting for broadband in rural areas
through the Save the Internet Act.
Mr. NEGUSE. I don’t want to brag,
but I will. Congressman JARED GOLDEN,
from the great State of Maine, is advo-
cating to lower the cots of prescription
drugs for his constituents.
Ms. HILL of California. And Con-
gresswoman JAHANA HAYES, who was
Teacher the Year before, is now fight-
ing to keep guns out of our classrooms.
Mr. NEGUSE. This freshman class
truly is legislating with aggressive mo-
mentum.
Ms. HILL of California. Oh, we are in-
deed. Eighteen freshmen are leading
House subcommittees, as my colleague,
Ms. STEVENS mentioned, including:
Congresswoman KENDRA HORN, Con-
gresswoman MIKIE SHERRILL, Congress-
man TJ COX, Congressman MIKE LEVIN,
Congressman HARLEY ROUDA, Congress-
woman SUSIE LEE, Congresswoman
XOCHITL TORRES SMALL, and Congress-
woman LIZZIE FLETCHER.
That is a lot of people. And what is
so exciting about that is that there has
never been a freshman class with this
many people with the gavel.
Mr. NEGUSE. Eighteen freshmen,
quite an incredible feat. But I will also
say that freshman Members of Con-
gress have had much success legis-
lating.
Congressman MAX ROSE from the
great State of New York has had three
amendments pass this House, including
an amendment to expand childcare
services for veterans seeking addi-
tional treatment.
Ms. HILL of California. Congressman
ANDY LEVIN, who we just heard from,
has introduced six pieces of original
legislation. That is a lot.
Mr. NEGUSE. Representative HILL, I
know that you know my great friend
and colleague ABIGAIL SPANBERGER,
who was able to include an amendment
as part of H.R. 1 that would prevent
foreign interference in U.S. elections.
Ms. HILL of California. Well, we real-
ly want that foreign interference not
happening in any future elections, so I
am glad to hear that.
Just this week, Congresswoman KIM
SCHRIER introduced bipartisan, bi-
cameral legislation to help prevent
child abuse.
Mr. NEGUSE. Congresswoman
CHRISSY HOULAHAN created a new bi-
partisan caucus to represent the inter-
ests of veterans.
Ms. HILL of California. Congress-
woman ABBY FINKENAUER was the first
freshman to have legislation pass the
House, a bill to bring Federal invest-
ment to small businesses in rural
America.
Mr. NEGUSE. I do know that Mem-
bers of this House would be well famil-
iar with Congressman CHRIS PAPPAS,
who has introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion to increase protections for first re-
sponders on the front lines of our Na-
tion’s opioid epidemic.
Ms. HILL of California. My other
friend, Congresswoman KATIE PORTER,
a fellow member of the Katie Caucus,
has introduced bipartisan legislation to
make childcare more affordable.
Mr. NEGUSE. All of these accom-
plishments that Representative HILL
and I have outlined that this freshman
class has accomplished I think dem-
onstrate that the freshman class is
continuing to deliver for the people.
Nearly 100 days into our trans-
formative majority, we have passed
major legislation across issue areas.
Ms. HILL of California. A truly
sweeping Democratic reform package.
Mr. NEGUSE. The first gun violence
prevention legislation passed in nearly
a decade.
Ms. HILL of California. The Pay-
check Fairness Act and reauthoriza-
tion of the Violence Against Women
Act.
Mr. NEGUSE. So as we conclude and
head into the next 100 days, I think it
is important to stress that we are
going to continue to work to lower the
cost of healthcare.
Ms. HILL of California. End corrup-
tion in Washington.
Mr. NEGUSE. Raise workers’ wages.
Ms. HILL of California. Invest in our
Nation’s infrastructure and public edu-
cation system.
Mr. NEGUSE. And, of course, address
the existential threat—climate change.
Ms. HILL of California. Above all, we
are going to stand up for the people,
again, with the full force of this fresh-
man class; and I am so excited to do it
with you, Mr. NEGUSE, and with all of
my fellow freshman colleagues.
Mr. NEGUSE. As am I, Representa-
tive HILL.
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congressman NEGUSE for sharing
some of his time with Congresswoman
HILL from California.
This Special Order hour has truly
been special, and what a delight to re-
flect on these first 100 days with a his-
toric freshman class in a new season
here in the Nation’s Capital.
Madam Speaker, I would like to con-
clude this Special Order hour of the
freshman class of the 116th Congress,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to yield to each
other in debate.
f
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
STATEHOOD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON) for 30 minutes.
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, a
week from Tuesday will be what we
call Emancipation Day in the District
of Columbia. We use that occasion to
point out the continued inequality of
the residents who live in our Nation’s
Capital.
Emancipation Day was the day when
Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in
the District of Columbia. Yes, there
were slaves working in the District of
Columbia. It was considered a South-
ern State. He freed them 9 months be-
fore the Emancipation Proclamation
freed all slaves.
Yet the residents of the Nation’s Cap-
ital remain less free than any other
Americans. Even without statehood,
however, the people of the Nation’s
Capital have, indeed, made progress.
Madam Speaker, I want to discuss
the problems and the progress, espe-
cially as we come close to the point
when we will bring our D.C. statehood
bill to the floor and the House will vote
whether to make the District the 51st
State.
b 1915
We recognize we were the last to be
free because we are not free yet. We
won’t be free until the District of Co-
lumbia becomes the 51st State of the
United States of America.
Now, I recognize, of course, there are
no slaves living in the District of Co-
lumbia today. But there is not a single
free and equal citizen resident of the
District of Columbia.
I cannot help but think of the stories
that were told me of my great-grand-
father, a runaway slave from Virginia.
I am a third-generation Washing-
tonian. He was in the District of Co-
lumbia when Lincoln freed the slaves
in the District of Columbia, but he was
a runaway slave, so he was not free
from slavery until 9 months later.
His name was Richard Holmes. My
family tells many stories about Rich-
ard Holmes. This runaway slave from
the District of Columbia came here to
work on the streets of the District of
Columbia. Actually, he came to get
away from slavery.
I don’t tell any heroic stories of
Richard Holmes. I tell it the way it was
told me. When nobody was looking,
Richard Holmes just walked off that
plantation. He found his way to the
District of Columbia. There were not
enough workers to build the streets of
the District of Columbia, so he was
able to get work on the streets building
this city.
I understand that slave owners went
around the streets of the District of
Columbia looking for their slaves. The
man who owned Richard Holmes found
him and went up to the straw boss and
said: That is my slave. I have come to
get him.
The straw boss said: You called out a
name. That man never answered to
that name. No, he is a good worker. He
is not your slave.
That is how Richard Holmes, whose
name was called out, by the slave

owner, ‘‘Richard,’’ remained in the Dis-
trict of Columbia so I could become El-
eanor Katherine Holmes and ulti-
mately the Member who represents the
District.
‘‘Richard,’’ they called out. By not
answering to his name, Richard Holmes
must have practiced for the day when
the slaveholder would come looking for
him. That is the kind of discipline I am
trying to bring to my work in the Con-
gress because freedom from slavery did
not give the residents of the District of
Columbia freedom.
Yet we celebrate Emancipation Day.
We are pleased that the slaves in the
District of Columbia were freed earlier
than the Emancipation Proclamation,
but that is only because the Federal
Government controlled the District of
Columbia, and, therefore, Abraham
Lincoln could say whether there would
be slaves in the District of Columbia.
In a real sense, the Federal Govern-
ment still has control over the District
of Columbia as I speak because the Dis-
trict does not even have full home rule.
Yes, in 1973, the District did obtain self
government. That means that the Dis-
trict has a Mayor and a city council
and governs itself, except when the
Congress of the United States decides
to intrude. And intrude, it does.
Until Democrats captured the major-
ity this session, I have had to ward off
bills to eliminate all the District’s gun
safety laws, for example. Intrusion can
be very dangerous.
Of course, now that Democrats are in
the majority, such a bill does not have
any chance of getting through. But I
have spent most of my time in the Con-
gress in the minority, and whatever I
have had to do for the District or get
to the District, I have had to do from
that perch.
Emancipation Day for the District is,
yes, a day off for the District, a holi-
day. It is just that important to us.
There are parades, and there are cele-
brations. But it is not like George
Washington’s birthday, and it is not
like Abraham Lincoln’s birthday. The
reason that it is a celebration in the
District of Columbia is to remind us,
the 700,000 residents who live in the
District of Columbia, of our continuing
obligation to work until the District
and its residents are entirely free.
In this country, even small matters
take work. I know because I have small
matters pending. But even without the
vote, I have been able to get three bills
passed in only 3 months of the Con-
gress. What it takes is work. What it
takes is an insistence to keep going
until you secure what residents de-
serve.
If I have any frustration, it is not
with the work I must do to make the
District the 51st State. It is with the
knowledge, according to the polls, that
most Americans think that the resi-
dents of the District of Columbia, their
Nation’s Capital, have the very same
rights that they do. Of course, I am on
this floor this evening to make sure
that they know we do not.
The new Members who just spoke on
the floor must have been shocked be-
cause they would have been among the
Americans who would have thought we
had the same rights that everyone else
does before they were elected.
Now, I don’t want to say, look, I
don’t have any rights, and I can’t do
anything for the District.
You can’t face your challenges that
way, Madam Speaker. I do vote in com-
mittee as the representative of the Dis-
trict of Columbia. I even vote on the
House floor.
When I first came to Congress, I rea-
soned that since I could vote in com-
mittee, I ought to be able to vote in
the Committee of the Whole. Some-
times we meet in the Committee of the
Whole, for example, to vote on amend-
ments. So I went to the Democratic
Speaker. It was a Democratic Speaker
for the first 2 years I was in Congress,
Tom Foley, and I asked to be able to
vote on the floor of the House.
He said: Eleanor, nobody ever said
the District should be able to vote on
the floor of the House, so I will have to
ask advice from outside counsel.
Tom Foley sent it to outside counsel.
They came back, and they said: Yes, in
the Committee of the Whole, if Con-
gress votes to allow her to vote, she
should be able to vote on the House
floor.
Because there was a Democratic ma-
jority, I was given the right to vote on
the House floor.
I will never forget what happened
afterward. My Republican friends then
sued the House for giving me the right
to vote on the House floor. They lost in
the district court. Then they took it to
the court of appeals, and they lost in
the court of appeals. They knew better
than to take it to the Supreme Court
of the United States. So I voted on the
House floor then, and I am voting on
the House floor again.
I only regret that I have spent most
of my time in Congress in the minor-
ity, and I have not had that right as
often as the Americans I represent de-
serve.
The District, of course, does not even
have full local control. Madam Speak-
er, you would think that my Repub-
lican colleagues would be the first to
give them that because the bywords for
Republicans are ‘‘federalism’’ and
‘‘local control.’’ Instead, as I have indi-
cated, they have spent years trying to
interfere with the District’s local con-
trol.
The one thing that ought to guar-
antee Americans freedom from Federal
interference, including the Congress of
the United States, is localism. Time
and again, I have asked my Republican
colleagues to grant me that privilege
that they think all Americans should
have.
The failure to give the District our
full rights is not only a violation of
every precept of the American creed,
but a violation of treaties that the
United States has signed. For example,
in 1977, the United States signed the
International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights. The Human Rights
Committee, which has oversight over
that treaty, has said that the United
Nations ‘‘remains concerned that resi-
dents of the District of Columbia do
not enjoy full representation in Con-
gress, a restriction that does not seem
to be compatible with article 25 of the
covenant,’’ the covenant the United
States has signed.
One of the reasons it galls the resi-
dents of the District of Columbia not
to have full rights is that, as this chart
shows, the residents pay more Federal
taxes than any of the 50 States. Take a
look. Mississippi pays the lowest Fed-
eral taxes, but it is the District of Co-
lumbia at $12,000-plus per person that
pays the highest.
If you are from New York or Cali-
fornia, Madam Speaker, if you are from
Idaho or the other Washington, you
pay fewer taxes per capita than the
people I represent, but you have more
rights than they do.
Nothing better illustrates, I think, in
a country where ‘‘taxes’’ is often a
dirty word, the inequity of paying
more taxes than Mississippi while Mis-
sissippi has every right the District of
Columbia has. I cite Mississippi only
because its residednts pay the lowest
taxes per capita.
Madam Speaker, there is a second
and perhaps more important reason to
claim our full citizenship. That, of
course, is that the residents of your
Nation’s Capital have fought and died
in every war, including the war that
created the United States of America,
the Revolutionary War.
On this chart, we show the sacrifices
during the 20th century when the
United States fought major world wars.
World War I, 635 D.C. casualties, that
was more than three States. Under-
stand, we are a city. We are smaller
than most States, though about the
size of seven States, but we had more
casualties than three States. The Ko-
rean war, 575 D.C. casualties, that was
more casualties than eight States.
Moving on to World War II, we find
3,575 casualties. Note the number is
going up, but that is more casualties
than four States. Finally, the Vietnam
war, 243 D.C. casualties, that was more
than 10 States.
b 1930
It is one thing to have given your
treasure; it is quite another to have
given the lives of your citizens.
The District, for most of its exist-
ence, has had fewer African Americans
than White people. That is not the case
today. It is about equal White and
Black citizens.
But, when I speak of war casualties,
I am reminded of citizens who have es-
pecially distinguished themselves in
time of war:
The first African American general
was born and raised in the District of
Columbia;
The first African American Air Force
general was also born in the District of
Columbia;

H3200 April 9, 2019
The first African American Naval
Academy graduate, born here in the
District of Columbia; and
The first African American Air Force
Academy graduate, born in the District
of Columbia.
I cite these African Americans be-
cause the District was a segregated
city as well. With segregation and no
vote, you see African Americans distin-
guishing themselves in the Armed
Forces of the United States, fighting
for their country.
So we move forward to today, and we
see great progress on our statehood
bill. Every Democratic Senator now
backs the findings of H.R. 1.
H.R. 1 is a democracy bill. It calls for
many kinds of improvements in democ-
racy, and in that bill is included find-
ings that lay out the case for D.C.
statehood. That means that those who
have voted for H.R. 1 here in the House
have also voted to approve statehood.
The Senate has a similar bill, but
with only three sections. It is Leader
Chuck Schumer’s bill. Their proposals
are not as fulsome as H.R. 1, but has
three major components: restoring the
Voting Rights Act; establishing na-
tional automatic voter registration
laws; and, yes, D.C. statehood.
D.C. statehood, for Democratic Sen-
ators, ranks just that high, along with
the national voting rights bills cited.
In both of our Chambers, Speaker
NANCY PELOSI and Minority Leader
CHUCK SCHUMER have been full-
throated supporters of D.C. statehood.
We are taking two paths to state-
hood, however, because so much of
home rule remains unfinished. Most of
home rule is done, but I think most
Americans would be amazed to find out
how much is not done.
For example, the District’s budget
still has to come to the House of Rep-
resentatives. We can get budget auton-
omy by vote of the House and the Sen-
ate without going all the way to state-
hood.
Or, take a life-and-death matter. We
are now in the midst of climate change
with all kinds of weather we had not
seen. If there are floods in the District
of Columbia or hurricanes, the District
of Columbia cannot call out its own
D.C. National Guard. It has got to go to
the President of the United States to
ask him to call out the D.C. National
Guard.
For goodness’ sake, by the time it
goes up the chain of command, half of
D.C. could be blown away. That is life
and death. That is what every single
State has, and D.C. can get that with-
out statehood.
So, while we recognize that in order
to get statehood we would have a tough
time in the Senate, we also rely on
making sure that we complete home
rule with matters having to do with
the District of Columbia as another
way to move toward getting more of
our rights.
Now, again, I don’t want to leave the
impression that because I don’t have
the final vote on the House floor I just
can’t get anything done. I have passed
three laws—the third month of Con-
gress, going into the fourth month—al-
ready, without being able to vote for
those bills.
And, I must say, I am very humbled,
but I also am proud at the same time,
that the organization that ranks Mem-
bers of Congress has ranked me as the
most effective Democrat in the Con-
gress, and that is without having a
vote.
To quote them, they said: The Center
defines legislative effectiveness as the
‘‘proven ability to advance a Member’s
agenda items through the legislative
process and into law.’’ That means
passing bills. And it went on to say
that Norton’s ranking is ‘‘noteworthy
because she is a nonvoting Member.’’
I point that out because I don’t want
my residents, especially, to hear me
here on the floor indicating how impor-
tant statehood is to then say: Well, I
don’t guess ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
can do anything for us until she finally
gets statehood.
I point out that I will be measured
not by whether I got statehood. I may
not get it. I will be measured by what
I was able to get for the District of Co-
lumbia, whose residents voted for me
to come to Congress.
Yes, only statehood can give the Dis-
trict the bucket of rights, the full
bucket it is entitled to. Only statehood
can make the District fully equal to
the residents of the States. Only state-
hood can mean for the District what it
means for the smallest States, that
you can have two Senators as well as a
Member of the House.
The District of Columbia has no Sen-
ators, so I have to do the work of both
Houses. That is not how it is supposed
to work.
So, instead of being disheartened, I
am, indeed, elated that we already
have 202 sponsors, or cosponsors, for
D.C. statehood. It takes 218 to pass the
bill.
People rushed onto the bill because
of the knowledge that there is some-
thing wrong that there are people in
our country who do not have the same
rights that others have, and for no
good reason.
If you were to ask people, ‘‘Well, why
not?’’ today they would not be able to
tell you. Without going into elaborate
detail, I will tell you that it was a
fluke that the District does not have
full rights, a fluke having to do with a
mishap or an incident when the Capitol
was in Philadelphia and the troops
from the Revolutionary War marched
on the then-Capitol demanding their
pensions.
The Framers were caught flat-footed
and said: Oh, my goodness. We better
make sure that the Capitol is not part
of any State, and this is part of Penn-
sylvania.
Well, of course, we know that that
was cured long ago. The District should
not be part of any State, doesn’t want
to be part of any State, but there are
plenty of armed troops to protect the
District from people marching on the
District or the Capitol for their pen-
sions or any other rights.
I am grateful to represent the Dis-
trict of Columbia. I am grateful be-
cause I love a good fight. I loved it as
a kid in the civil rights movement. I
loved it when I grew up in the District
of Columbia, going to segregated
schools and recognizing that all I had
to do was get a good education and I
could get out of that too.
But I take it as an honor and a privi-
lege to represent residents who, in each
and every way, are fully equal to each
and every American and to do all that
I possibly can to make that feeling re-
ality in the United States of America.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING AND RE-
QUEST FOR COMMENTS FROM INTERESTED
PARTIES
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES OF PRO-
CEDURE, NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING,
AS REQUIRED BY 2 U.S.C. § 1383, THE CONGRES-
SIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995, AS
AMENDED
Introductory Statement
Shortly after the enactment of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act (CAA or the
Act) in 1995, Procedural Rules were adopted
to govern the processing of cases and con-
troversies under the administrative proce-
dures established in subchapter IV of the
CAA. 2 U.S.C. 1401–07. Those Rules of Proce-
dure were amended in 1998, 2004, and again in
2016. The existing Rules of Procedure are
available in their entirety on the public
website of the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights (OCWR): www.ocwr.gov.
Pursuant to section 303(a) of the CAA (2
U.S.C. 1383(a)), the Executive Director of the
OCWR has obtained approval of its Board of
Directors regarding certain amendments to
the Rules of Procedure.
After obtaining the Board’s approval, the
OCWR Executive Director must then ‘‘pub-
lish a general notice of proposed rulemaking
. . . for publication in the Congressional
Record on the first day on which both Houses
are in session following such transmittal.’’
(Section 303(b) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1383(b)).

ments to the OCWR Procedural Rules set

Supplementary Information
The Congressional Accountability Act of
1995, Pub. L. No. 104–1, was enacted into law
on January 23, 1995. The CAA applies the
rights and protections of 13 federal labor and
employment statutes to covered employees
and employing offices within the legislative
branch of the federal government. Section
301 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381) establishes the
OCWR as an independent office within that
branch. Section 303 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1383)
directs the Executive Director, as Chief Op-
erating Officer, to adopt rules of procedure
governing the OCWR, subject to approval by
the Board of Directors of the Office. The
OCWR Rules of Procedure establish the proc-
ess by which alleged violations of the 13 laws
made applicable to the legislative branch
under the CAA are considered and resolved.
On December 21, 2018, the Congressional
Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act was
signed into law. (Pub. L. No. 115–397). The
new law reflects the first set of comprehen-
sive reforms to the CAA since 1995. Among
other reforms, the Act substantially modi-
fies the administrative dispute resolution
(ADR) process under the CAA, including:
providing for preliminary hearing officer re-
view of claims; requiring current and former
Members of Congress to reimburse awards or
settlement payments resulting from harass-
ment or retaliation claims; requiring certain
employing offices to reimburse payments re-
sulting from specified claims of discrimina-
tion; and appointing advisers to provide con-
fidential information to legislative branch
employees about their rights under the CAA.
Most changes to the ADR process will be ef-
fective 180 days from the date of enactment
of the Reform Act, i.e., on June 19, 2019.
These proposed amendments to the
OCWR’s Procedural Rules are the result of
the OCWR’s comprehensive review of the
OCWR’s procedures in light of the changes in
the Reform Act to the ADR program, and
they reflect the OCWR’s experience proc-
essing disputes under the CAA since the
original adoption of these Rules in 1995.
Scope of Comments Requested
The OCWR asks commenters to provide
their views on the changes to the Procedural
Rules proposed by the OCWR.
Summary of the Changes
Subpart A. Subpart A of the Procedural
Rules covers general provisions pertaining to
scope and policy, definitions, and informa-
tion on various filings and computation of
time. The OCWR’s proposed amendments to
subpart A provide additional definitions, and
also clarify pleading requirements and proce-
dures concerning confidentiality.
Subpart B. Currently, subpart B of the Pro-
cedural Rules sets forth the pre-complaint
procedures applicable to consideration of al-
leged violations of sections 201 through 207 of
the CAA, which concern employment dis-
crimination, family and medical leave, fair
labor standards, employee polygraph protec-
tion, worker adjustment and retraining, em-
ployment and reemployment of veterans, and
reprisal. Specifically, subpart B sets forth
procedures for mandatory pre-complaint
counseling and mediation, as well as the
statutory election to file either an adminis-
trative complaint with the OCWR or a civil
action in a U.S. district court. Under the
CAA Reform Act, however, counseling and
mediation are no longer mandatory jurisdic-
tional prerequisites to adjudication of an al-
leged violation of sections 201–07 of the CAA.
Therefore, the OCWR proposes to remove the
procedures for mandatory counseling and
mandatory mediation from subpart B. Under
the proposed rules, the remaining provisions
of subpart B—which concern mediation and
the statutory election—appear in subpart D.
The OCWR proposes to reserve a new sub-
part B for proposed rules and procedures for
enforcement of the inspection, investigation
and complaint sections 210(d) and (f) of the
CAA, which relate to Public Services and Ac-
commodations under titles II and III of the
Americans with Disabilities Act. (Subpart C
had been reserved for these rules since 1995.)
Subpart C. The OCWR proposes to redesig-
nate the contents of current subpart D as
subpart C. Therefore, sections 3.01 through
3.15 of this subpart prescribe rules and proce-
dures for enforcement of the inspection and
citation provisions of section 215(c)(1)
through (3) of the CAA, which concern the
protections set forth in the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHAct). Sec-
tions 3.20 through 3.31 contain rules of prac-
tice for administrative proceedings to grant
variances and other relief under sections
6(b)(6)(A) and 6(d) of the OSHAct, as applied
by section 215(c)(4) of the CAA. The proposed
modifications to subpart C reflect nomen-
clature changes only. The modifications
clarify that references to the ‘‘Hearing Offi-
cer’’ in this subpart are to the ‘‘Merits Hear-
ing Officer’’ (defined in these proposed rules
as the individual appointed by the Executive
Director to preside over an administrative
hearing conducted on matters within the Of-
fice’s jurisdiction under section 405 of the
Act), and not the ‘‘Preliminary Hearing Offi-
cer’’ (defined in these proposed rules as the
individual appointed by the Executive Direc-
tor to make a preliminary review of claims
arising under sections 102(c) and 201 through
207 of the CAA).
Subparts D and E. The Procedural Rules
currently set forth a single set of procedures
for filing ‘‘complaints’’ under the CAA,
whether the complaint is filed with the
OCWR by an employee alleging violations of
sections 201 through 207 of the Act, or by the
OCWR General Counsel alleging violations of
sections 210, 215 or 220 of the Act. The CAA
Reform Act, however, uses the word ‘‘claim’’
to refer to an alleged violation of sections
201 through 207 of the Act (as well as an al-
leged violation of section 102(c) of the Act,
which incorporates the protections of the
Genetic Information Nondisclosure Act). As
a result, the term ‘‘complaint’’ in the CAA
refers only to violations alleged by the
OCWR General Counsel.
Because the procedures in the Reform Act
governing employee ‘‘claims’’ differ signifi-
cantly from those governing General Counsel
‘‘complaints,’’ these proposed rules set forth
separate procedures for each. Therefore, sub-
part D, which concerns employee ‘‘claims,’’
includes new procedures for informal em-
ployee requests for advice and information;
confidential advising services; filing of
claims; electing to file a civil action; initial
processing and transmission of claims to par-
ties; notification requirements; voluntary
mediation; preliminary review of claims by a
‘‘Preliminary Hearing Officer;’’ requesting
an administrative hearing before a ‘‘Merits
Hearing Officer;’’ summary judgment and
withdrawal of claims; confidentiality re-
quirements; and automatic referral to con-
gressional ethics committees.
Proposed subpart E, which concerns Gen-
eral Counsel complaints, sets forth proce-
dures for filing complaints, appointment of
the Merits Hearing Officer, dismissals, sum-
mary judgment, withdrawal of complaints,
and confidentiality requirements. The new
provisions in the Reform Act governing mat-
ters such as confidential advising services,
preliminary review of claims, and automatic
referral to congressional ethics committees,
do not apply to OCWR General Counsel com-
plaints alleging violations of sections 210, 215
or 220 of the Act. Therefore, they are not ad-
dressed in proposed subpart E.
Subparts F–H. Subparts F and G include the
process for the conduct of administrative
hearings held as the result of the filing of an
administrative claim or an administrative
complaint. Subpart H sets forth the proce-
dures for appeals of decisions by Hearing Of-
ficers to the OCWR Board of Directors and
for appeals of decisions by the Board of Di-
rectors to the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Federal Circuit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3202 April 9, 2019
Proposed amendments to subpart F con-
cern such matters as depositions requests in
cases in which a Member of Congress is an
intervenor, rulings on motions to quash and
motions to limit, and formal requirements
for sworn statements. Proposed amendments
to subpart G clarify the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer’s authority concerning frivolous claims,
defenses, and arguments. The proposed
amendments also set forth the substantive
requirements for the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer’s written decision, including required
findings when a final decision concerns a
claim alleging a violation or violations de-
scribed in section 415(d)(1)(C) of the Act,
which requires Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate to reimburse the
‘‘compensatory damages’’ portion of a deci-
sion, award or settlement for a violation of
section 201(a), 206(a), or 207 of the Act that
the Member is found to have ‘‘committed
personally.’’ Proposed Amendments to sub-
part H concern appellate proceedings before
the Board. They clarify that a report on pre-
liminary review pursuant to section 402(c) of
the CAA is not appealable to the Board.
Subpart I. Subpart I concerns other mat-
ters of general applicability to the dispute
resolution process and to the OCWR’s oper-
ations. Proposed amendments to subpart I
concern requests for attorney fees in arbitra-
tion proceedings; informal resolution of dis-
putes; general requirements for formal set-
tlement agreements—including settlement
of cases making allegations against a Mem-
ber of Congress subject to the payment reim-
bursement provisions of section 415(d) of the
Act.
The proposed amendments to subpart I
also concern payments governed by section
415(a) of the CAA, which provides, in rel-
evant part, that ‘‘only funds which are ap-
propriated to an account of the Office in the
Treasury of the United States for the pay-
ment of awards and settlements may be used
for the payment of awards and settlements
under this chapter.’’ Pursuant to section
415(a), the OCWR, through its Executive Di-
rector, prepares and processes requisitions
for disbursements from the Treasury account
established pursuant to section 415(a) when
qualifying final decisions, awards, or ap-
proved settlements require the payment of
funds. These proposed amendments provide
further guidance for processing certifi-
cations of payments from the funds appro-
priated to the Section 415(a) Treasury Ac-
count. They are based on regulations issued
by the Department of Treasury’s Bureau of
Fiscal Services at 31 C.F.R. part 256, which
provide guidance to agencies in the execu-
tive branch for submitting requests for pay-
ments from the Judgment Fund, which is a
permanent, indefinite appropriation that is
available to pay many judicially and admin-
istratively ordered monetary awards against
the United States. The proposed amend-
ments also concern reimbursement to the
Section 415(a) Treasury Account in cases
when the Act requires: (1) Members of the
House of Representatives and the Senate to
reimburse the ‘‘compensatory damages’’ por-
tion of a decision, award or settlement for a
violation of section 201(a), 206(a), or 207 that
the Member is found to have ‘‘committed
personally;’’ and (2) employing offices (other
than an employing office of the House or
Senate) to reimburse awards and settlements
paid from the Section 415(a) Treasury Ac-
count in connection with claims alleging
violations of section 201(a) or 206(a) of the
Act.
The proposed amendments to subpart I
also add a new section governing the require-
ment in the Reform Act that employing of-
fices must post and keep posted in con-
spicuous places on their premises the notices
provided by the OCWR, which contain infor-
mation about employees’ rights and the
OCWR’s ADR process, along with OCWR con-
tact information. Finally, the proposed
amendments set forth rules concerning the
new requirement in the Reform Act that
each employing office (other than any em-
ploying office of the House of Representa-
tives or any employing office of the Senate)
submit a report both to the Committee on
House Administration of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Committee on Rules
and Administration of the Senate on the im-
plementation of the training and education
program required under section 438(a) of the
Act.

dentiary support or, if specifically so identi-
fied, will likely have evidentiary support

so identified, are reasonably based on belief
or a lack of information.

tory time limit, at the discretion of the Ex-
ecutive Director, General Counsel, mediator,
hearing officer, or Board, additional time
may be provided to allow the party to des-
ignate a new representative as consistent
with the Act.
8. Amend section 1.08 by:
(a) Revising paragraphs (a) through (e); and
(b) Republishing paragraph (f).
The revisions read as follows:
§ 1.08 Confidentiality.
(a) Policy. Except as provided in sections
302(d) and 416(c), (d), and (e) of the Act, the
Office shall maintain confidentiality in the
confidential advising process, mediation, and
the proceedings and deliberations of hearing
officers and the Board in accordance with
sections 302(d)(2)(B) and 416(a)–(b) of the Act.
(b) Participant. For the purposes of this
rule, ‘‘participant’’ means an individual or
entity who takes part as either a party, wit-
ness, or designated representative in con-
fidential advising under section 302(d) of the
Act, mediation under section 404, the claim
and hearing process under section 405, or an
appeal to the Board under section 406 of the
Act, or any related proceeding which is ex-
pressly or by necessity deemed confidential
under the Act or these rules.
(c) Prohibition. Unless specifically author-
ized by the provisions of the Act or by these
rules, no participant in the confidential ad-
vising process, mediation, or other pro-
ceedings made confidential under section 416
of the Act may disclose a written or an oral
communication that is prepared for the pur-
pose of or that occurs during the confidential
advising process, mediation, and the pro-
ceedings and deliberations of Hearing Offi-
cers and the Board.
(d) Exceptions. Nothing in these rules pro-
hibits a party or its representative from dis-
closing information obtained in mediation or
hearings when reasonably necessary to in-
vestigate claims, ensure compliance with the
Act, or prepare its prosecution or defense.
However, the party making the disclosure
shall take all reasonably appropriate steps
to ensure that persons to whom the informa-
tion is disclosed maintain the confiden-
tiality of such information. These rules do
not preclude a mediator from consulting
with the Office, except that when the cov-
ered employee is an employee of the Office,
a mediator shall not consult with any indi-
vidual within the Office who is or who might
be a party or witness. These rules do not pre-
clude the Office from reporting information
to the Senate and House of Representatives
as required by the Act.
(e) Contents or Records of Mediation or Hear-
ings. For the purpose of this rule, the con-
tents or records of the confidential advising
process, mediation or other proceeding in-
cludes the information disclosed by partici-
pants to the proceedings, and records dis-
closed by the opposing party, witnesses, or
the Office. A participant is free to disclose
facts and other information obtained from
any source outside of the mediation or hear-
ing. For example, an employing office or its
representatives may disclose information
about its employment practices and per-
sonnel actions, provided that the informa-
tion was not obtained in a confidential pro-
ceeding. However, a claimant who obtains
that information in mediation or other con-
fidential proceeding may not disclose such
information. Similarly, information forming
the basis for the allegation of a claimant
may be disclosed by that claimant, provided
that the information contained in those alle-
gations was not obtained in a confidential
proceeding. However, the employing office or
its representatives may not disclose that in-
formation if it was obtained in a confidential
proceeding.
(f) Sanctions. The Executive Director will
advise all participants in the mediation and
hearing at the time they became partici-
pants of the confidentiality requirements of
section 416 of the Act and that sanctions
may be imposed by a Hearing Officer for a
violation of those requirements. No sanc-
tions may be imposed except for good cause
and the particulars of which must be stated
in the sanction order.

rector must be a lawyer who is admitted to
practice before, and is in good standing with,
the bar of a State or territory of the United
States or the District of Columbia, and who
has experience representing clients in cases

not act as the designated representative for
any covered employee in connection with the
covered employee’s participation in any pro-
ceeding, including any proceeding under the
Act, any judicial proceeding, or any pro-
ceeding before any committee of Congress. A

vide any of the services in section 302(d)(2) of
the Act if the covered employee has des-
ignated an attorney representative in con-
nection with the employee’s participation in
any proceeding under the Act, except that
the Confidential Advisor may provide gen-
eral assistance and information to the attor-
ney representative regarding the Act and the
role of the Office, as the Confidential Advi-
sor deems appropriate.

ployee has accepted and received any serv-
ices offered under section 302(d)(2) of the Act

ices requested under section 302(d)(2) by the
covered employee shall be provided, to the
extent practicable, by the same Confidential
Advisor.

§ 4.07 Mediation.
(a) Overview. Mediation is a process in
which employees, including unpaid staff for
purposes of section 201 of the Act, employing
offices, and their representatives, if any,
meet with a mediator trained to assist them
in resolving disputes. As participants in the
mediation, employees, employing offices,
and their representatives discuss alter-
natives to continuing their dispute, includ-
ing the possibility of reaching a voluntary,
mutually satisfactory resolution. The medi-
ator cannot impose a specific resolution, and
all information discussed or disclosed in the
course of any mediation shall be strictly
confidential, pursuant to section 416 of the
Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, section
416 expressly provides that a covered em-
ployee may disclose the ‘‘factual allegations
underlying the covered employee’s claim’’
and an employing office may disclose ‘‘the

factual allegations underlying the employing
office’s defense to the claim[.]’’
(b) Availability of Optional Mediation. Upon
receipt of a claim filed pursuant to section
402 of the Act, the Office shall notify the cov-
ered employee and the employing office
about the process for mediation and applica-
ble deadlines. If the claim alleges a Member
committed an act made unlawful under sec-
tions 201(a), 206(a) or 207 of the Act which
consists of a violation of section 415(d)(1)(A),
the Office shall permit the Member to inter-
vene in the mediation. The request for medi-
ation shall contain the claim number, the re-
questing party’s name, office or personal ad-
dress, e-mail address, telephone number, and
the opposing party’s name. Failure to re-
quest mediation does not adversely impact
future proceedings.
(c) Timing. The covered employee or the
employing office may file a written request
for mediation beginning on the date that the
covered employee or employing office, re-
spectively, receives notice from the Office
about the mediation process. The time to re-
quest mediation under these rules ends on
the date on which a Merits Hearing Officer
issues a written decision on the claim, or the
covered employee files a civil action,
(d) Notice of Commencement of the Mediation.
The Office shall promptly notify the oppos-
ing party or its designated representative of
the request for mediation and the deadlines
applicable to such mediation. When a claim
alleges a violation described in subpara-
graphs (A) and (B) of section 402(b)(2) of the
Act that consists of a violation described in
section 415(d)(1)(A) by a Member of Congress,
the Office shall notify immediately such
Member of the right to intervene in any me-
diation concerning the claim.
(e) Selection of Mediators; Disqualification.
Upon receipt of the second party’s agreement
to mediate, the Executive Director shall as-
sign one or more mediators from a master
list developed and maintained pursuant to
section 404 of the Act, to commence the me-
diation process. Should the mediator con-
sider himself or herself unable to perform in
a neutral role in a given situation, he or she
shall withdraw from the matter and imme-
diately shall notify the Office of the with-
drawal. Any party may ask the Office to dis-
qualify a mediator by filing a written re-
quest, including the reasons for such request,
with the Executive Director. This request
shall be filed as soon as the party has reason
to believe there is a basis for disqualifica-
tion. The Executive Director’s decision on
this request shall be final and unreviewable.
(f) Duration and Extension.
(1) The mediation period shall be 30 days
beginning on the first day after the second
party agrees to mediate the matter.
(2) The Executive Director shall extend the
mediation period an additional 30 days upon
the joint written request of the parties, or of
the appointed mediator on behalf of the par-
ties. The request shall be written and filed
with the Executive Director no later than
the last day of the mediation period.
(g) Effect of Mediation on Proceedings.
Upon the parties’ agreement to mediate a
claim, any deadline relating to the proc-
essing of that claim that has not already
passed by the first day of the mediation pe-
riod, shall be stayed during the mediation
period.
(h) Procedures.
(1) The Mediator’s Role. After assignment of
the case, the mediator will contact the par-
ties. The mediator has the responsibility to
conduct the mediation, including deciding
how many meetings are necessary and who
may participate in each meeting. The medi-
ator may accept and may ask the parties to
provide written submissions.
(2) The Agreement to Mediate. At the com-
mencement of the mediation, the mediator
will ask the participants and/or their rep-
resentatives to sign an agreement prepared
by the Office (‘‘the Agreement to Mediate’’).
The Agreement to Mediate will define what
is to be kept confidential during mediation
and set out the conditions under which medi-
ation will occur, including the requirement
that the participants adhere to the confiden-
tiality of the process and a notice that a
breach of the mediation agreement could re-
sult in sanctions later in the proceedings.
(i) The parties, including an intervenor
Member, may elect to participate in medi-
ation proceedings through a designated rep-
resentative, provided that the representative
has actual authority to agree to a settle-
ment agreement, or has immediate access to
someone with actual settlement authority,
and provided further that, should the medi-
ator deem it appropriate at any time, the
physical presence in mediation of any party
may be required. The Office may participate
in the mediation process through a rep-
resentative and/or observer. The mediator
may determine, as best serves the interests
of mediation, whether the participants may
meet jointly or separately with the medi-
ator. At the request of any of the parties, the
parties shall be separated during medation.
(j) Informal Resolutions and Settlement
Agreements. At any time during mediation
the parties may resolve or settle a dispute in
accordance with subparagraph 9.03 of these
Rules.
(k) Conclusion of the Mediation Period and
Notice. If, at the end of the mediation period,
the parties have not resolved the matter
that forms the basis of the request for medi-
ation, the Office shall provide the employee,
Member, and the employing office, and their
representatives, with written notice that the
mediation period has concluded. The written
notice will be e-filed, e†mailed, sent by first-
class mail, faxed, or personally delivered.
(l) Independence of the Mediation Process
and the Mediator. The Office will maintain
the independence of the mediation process
and the mediator. No individual appointed
by the Executive Director to mediate may
conduct or aid in a hearing conducted under
section 405 of the Act with respect to the
same matter or shall be subject to subpoena
or any other compulsory process with re-
spect to the same matter.
(m) Violation of Confidentiality in Mediation.
An alleged violation of the confidentiality
provisions may be made by a party in medi-
ation to the mediator during the mediation
period and, if not resolved by agreement in
mediation, to a Merits Hearing Officer dur-
ing proceedings brought under section 405 of
the Act.
(n) Exceptions to Confidentiality in Medi-
ation. It shall not be a violation of confiden-
tiality to provide the information required
by sections 301(l) and 416(d) of the Act.
§ 4.08 Preliminary Review of Claims.
(a) Appointment of Preliminary Hearing Offi-
cer. Not later than 7 days after transmission
to the employing office of a claim or claims,
the Executive Director shall appoint a hear-
ing officer to conduct a preliminary review
of the claim or claims filed by the claimant.
The appointment of the Preliminary Hearing
Officer shall be in accordance with the re-
quirements of section 405(c) of the Act.
(b) Disqualifying a Preliminary Hearing Offi-
cer.
(1) In the event that a Preliminary Hearing
Officer considers himself or herself disquali-
fied, either because of personal bias or of an
interest in the case or for some other dis-
qualifying reason, he or she shall withdraw
from the case, stating in writing or on the
record the reasons for his or her withdrawal,
and shall immediately notify the Office of
the withdrawal.
(2) Any party may file a motion requesting
that a Preliminary Hearing Officer withdraw
on the basis of personal bias or of an interest
in the case or for some other disqualifying
reason. This motion shall specifically set
forth the reasons supporting the request and
be filed as soon as the party has reason to be-
lieve that there is a basis for disqualifica-
tion.
(3) The Preliminary Hearing Officer shall
promptly rule on the withdrawal motion. If
the motion is granted, the Executive Direc-
tor will appoint another Preliminary Hear-
ing Officer within 3 days. Any objection to
the Preliminary Hearing Officer’s ruling on
the withdrawal motion shall not be deemed
waived by a party’s further participation in
the preliminary review process. Such objec-
tion will not stay the conduct of the prelimi-
nary review process.
(c) Assessments Required. In conducting a
preliminary review of a claim or claims
under this section, the Preliminary Hearing
Officer shall assess each of the following:
(1) whether the claimant is a covered em-
ployee authorized to obtain relief relating to
the claim(s) under the Act;
(2) whether the office which is the subject
of the claim(s) is an employing office under
the Act;
(3) whether the individual filing the
claim(s) has met the applicable deadlines for
filing the claim(s) under the Act;
(4) the identification of factual and legal
issues in the claim(s);
(5) the specific relief sought by the claim-
ant;
(6) whether, on the basis of the assess-
ments made under paragraphs (1) through
(5), the claimant is a covered employee who
has stated a claim for which, if the allega-
tions contained in the claim are true, relief
may be granted under the Act; and
(7) the potential for the settlement of the
claim(s) without a formal hearing as pro-
vided under section 405 of the Act or a civil
action as provided under section 408 of the
Act.
(d) Amendments to Claims. Amendments to
the claim(s) may be permitted in the Pre-
liminary Hearing Officer’s discretion, taking
the following factors into consideration:
(1) whether the amendments relate to the
cause of action set forth in the claim(s); and
(2) whether such amendments will unduly
prejudice the rights of the employing office,
or of other parties, unduly delay the prelimi-
nary review, or otherwise interfere with or
impede the proceedings.
(e) Report on Preliminary Review.
(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2),
not later than 30 days after a claim form is
filed, the Preliminary Hearing Officer shall
submit to the claimant and the respondent(s)
a report on the preliminary review. The re-
port shall include a determination whether
the claimant is a covered employee who has
stated a claim for which, if the allegations
contained in the claim are true, relief may
be granted under the Act. Submitting the re-
port concludes the preliminary review.
(2) In determining whether a claimant has
stated a claim for which relief may be grant-
ed under the Act, the Preliminary Hearing
Officer shall:
(A) be guided by judicial and Board deci-
sions under the laws made applicable by sec-
tion 102 of the Act; and
(B) consider whether the legal contentions
the claimant advocates are warranted by ex-
isting law or by a nonfrivolous argument for
extending, modifying, or reversing existing
law or for establishing new law.
(3) Extension of Deadline. The Preliminary
Hearing Officer may, upon notice to the indi-
vidual filing the claim(s) and the respond-
ent(s), use an additional period of not to ex-
ceed 30 days to conclude the preliminary re-
view.

(1) If the Preliminary Hearing Officer’s re-
port under subparagraph (e) includes the de-
termination that the claimant is not a cov-
ered employee or has not stated a claim for

(A) the claimant (including a Library

hearing as provided under section 405 of the
Act as to the claim; and

rector with written notice that the claimant

cordance with section 408 of the Act.

not later than 90 days after receiving the
written notice referred to in subparagraph
(1)(B).
(g) Transmission of Report on Preliminary Re-
view of Certain Claims to Congressional Ethics
Committees. When a Preliminary Hearing Of-
ficer issues a report on the preliminary re-
view of a claim alleging a violation described
in section 415(d)(1)(A) of the Act, the Pre-
liminary Hearing Officer shall transmit the
report to—
(1) the Committee on Ethics of the House
of Representatives, in the case of such an al-
leged act by a Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives (including a Delegate or Resi-
dent Commissioner to the Congress); or
(2) the Select Committee on Ethics of the
Senate, in the case of such an alleged act by
a Senator.
§ 4.09 Request for Administrative Hearing.
(a) Except as provided in subparagraph (b),
a claimant may submit to the Executive Di-
rector a written request for an administra-
tive hearing under section 405 of the Act not
later than 10 days after the Preliminary
Hearing Officer submits the report on the
preliminary review of a claim under section
403(c).
(b) Subparagraph (a) does not apply to the
claim if—
(1) the preliminary review report of the
claim under section 403(c) of the Act includes
the determination that the individual filing
the claim is not a covered employee who has
stated a claim for which relief may be grant-
ed, as described in section 403(d) of the Act;
or
(2) the covered employee files a civil action
as to the claim as provided in section 408 of
the Act.
(c) Appointment of the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer.
(1) Upon the filing of a request for an ad-
ministrative hearing under subparagraph (a)
of this section, the Executive Director shall
appoint an independent Merits Hearing Offi-
cer to consider the claim(s) and render a de-
cision, who shall have the authority speci-
fied in sections 4.10 and 7.01 of these Rules
below.
(2) The Preliminary Hearing Officer shall
not serve as the Merits Hearing Officer in
the same case.
(d) Answer.
(1) Within 10 days after the filing of a re-
quest for an administrative hearing under
subparagraph (a), the respondent(s) shall file
an answer with the Office and serve one copy
on the claimant. Filing a motion to dismiss
a claim does not stay the time period for fil-
ing the answer.
(2) In answering a claim form, the respond-
ent(s) must state in short and plain terms its
defenses to each claim asserted against it
and admit or deny the allegations asserted
against it.
(3) Failure to deny an allegation, other
than one relating to the amount of damages,
or to raise a defense as to any allegation(s)
shall constitute an admission of such allega-
tion(s). Affirmative defenses not raised in an
answer that could have reasonably been an-
ticipated based on the facts alleged in the
claim form shall be deemed waived.
(4) A respondent’s motion for leave to
amend an answer to interpose a denial or af-
firmative defense will ordinarily be granted
unless to do so would unduly prejudice the
rights of the other party or unduly delay or
otherwise interfere with or impede the pro-
ceedings.
§ 4.10 Summary Judgment and Withdrawal of
Claims.
(a) If a claimant fails to proceed with a
claim, the Merits Hearing Officer may dis-
miss the claim with prejudice.
(b) Summary Judgment. A Merits Hearing
Officer may, after notice and an opportunity
for the parties to address the question of
summary judgment, issue summary judg-
ment on the claim. A motion before the Mer-
its Hearing Officer asserting that the cov-
ered employee has failed to state a claim
upon which relief can be granted shall be
construed as a motion for summary judg-
ment on the ground that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as to that claim as a
matter of law.
(c) Appeal. A final decision by the Merits
Hearing Officer made under section 4.10 or
7.16 of these Rules may be subject to appeal
before the Board if the aggrieved party files
a timely petition for review under section
8.01 of these Rules. A final decision under
subparagraphs 4.10(a)–(d) of these Rules that
does not resolve all of the issues in the
case(s) before the Merits Hearing Officer
may not be appealed to the Board in advance
of a final decision entered under section 7.16
of these Rules, except as authorized pursuant
to section 7.13.
(d) Withdrawal of Claim. At any time, a
claimant may withdraw his or her own
claim(s) by filing a notice with the Office for
transmittal to the Preliminary or Merits

(d) Amendments. Amendments to the com-
plaint may be permitted by the Office or,

the following conditions: that all parties to
the proceeding have adequate notice to pre-
pare to meet the new allegations; that the
amendments, as appropriate, relate to the
charge(s) investigated and/or the citation or
notification issued by the General Counsel;
and that permitting such amendments will
not unduly prejudice the rights of the em-
ploying office, the labor organization, or
other parties, unduly delay the completion
of the hearing, or otherwise interfere with or
impede the proceedings.
(e) Service of Complaint. Upon receipt of a
complaint or an amended complaint, the Of-
fice shall serve the respondent, or its des-
ignated representative, by hand delivery or
first-class mail, e-mail, or facsimile with a

(3) Failure to deny an allegation, other
than one relating to the amount of damages,
or to raise a claim or defense as to any alle-
gation(s) shall constitute an admission of
such allegation(s). Affirmative defenses not
raised in an answer that could have reason-
ably been anticipated based on the facts al-
leged in the complaint shall be deemed
waived.
(4) A respondent’s motion for leave to
amend an answer to interpose a denial or af-
firmative defense will ordinarily be granted
unless to do so would unduly prejudice the
rights of the other party or unduly delay or
otherwise interfere with or impede the pro-
ceedings.

swer, a respondent may file a motion to dis-
miss, or other responsive pleading with the
Office and serve one copy on the complain-
ant. Responses to any motions shall comply
with subparagraph 1.04(c) of these Rules. A
motion asserting that the General Counsel
has failed to state a claim upon which relief
can be granted may, in the Merits Hearing
Officer’s discretion, be construed as a motion
for summary judgment pursuant to subpara-
graph 5.03(d) of these Rules on the ground
that the moving party is entitled to judg-
ment as a matter of law.
§ 5.02 Appointment of the Merits Hearing Of-
ficer.
Upon the filing of a complaint, the Execu-
tive Director will appoint an independent
Merits Hearing Officer, who shall have the

7.01(b) of the Rules below.
§ 5.03 Dismissal, Summary Judgment and
Withdrawal of Complaints.
(a) A Merits Hearing Officer may, after no-
tice and an opportunity to respond, dismiss
any claim that the Merits Hearing Officer
finds to be frivolous or that fails to state a
claim upon which relief may be granted.
(b) A Merits Hearing Officer may, after no-
tice and an opportunity to respond, dismiss a
complaint because it fails to comply with
the applicable time limits or other require-
ments under the Act or these Rules.
(c) If the General Counsel fails to proceed
with an action, the Merits Hearing Officer
may dismiss the complaint with prejudice.
(d) Summary Judgment. A Merits Hearing
Officer may, after notice and an opportunity
for the parties to address the question of
summary judgment, issue summary judg-
ment on some or all of the complaint.
(e) Appeal. A final decision by the Merits
Hearing Officer made under sections 5.03(a)–
(d) or 7.16 of these Rules may be subject to
appeal before the Board if the aggrieved
party files a timely petition for review under
section 8.01. A final decision under old sub-
paragraph 5.03(a)–(d) that does not resolve all
of the claims or issues in the case(s) before
the Merits Hearing Officer may not be ap-
pealed to the Board in advance of a final de-
cision entered under section 7.16 of these
Rules, except as authorized pursuant to sec-
tion 7.13.
(f) Withdrawal of Complaint by the General
Counsel. At any time prior to the opening of
the hearing, the General Counsel may with-
draw his complaint by filing a notice with
the Office for transmittal to the Merits
Hearing Officer and by serving a copy on the
respondent. After opening of the hearing,
any such withdrawal must be approved by
the Merits Hearing Officer and may be with
or without prejudice to refile at the Merits
Hearing Officer’s discretion.
(g) Withdrawal from a Case by a Representa-
tive. A representative must provide sufficient
notice to the Merits Hearing Officer and the
parties of record of his or her withdrawal
from a case. Until the party designates an-
other representative in writing, the party
will be regarded as appearing pro se.
§ 5.04 Confidentiality.
Pursuant to section 416(b) of the Act, ex-
cept as provided in subsections 416(c) and (f),
all proceedings and deliberations of Merits
Hearing Officers and the Board, including
any related records, shall be confidential.
Section 416(b) does not apply to proceedings
under section 215 of the Act, but does apply
to the deliberations of Merits Hearing Offi-
cers and the Board under section 215. A vio-
lation of the confidentiality requirements of
the Act and these rules may result in the im-
position of procedural or evidentiary sanc-
tions. See also sections 1.08 and 7.12 of these
Rules.
SUBPART F—[AMENDED]
[Table of Contents Omitted]
Revise subpart F to read as follows:
§ 6.01 Discovery.
(a) Description. Discovery is the process by
which a party may obtain from another per-
son, including a party, information that is
not privileged and that is reasonably cal-
culated to lead to the discovery of admis-
sible evidence, to assist that party in devel-
oping, preparing and presenting its case at
the hearing. No discovery, whether oral or
written, by any party shall be taken of or
from an employee of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights (including but not
limited to a Board member, the Executive
Director, the General Counsel, a Confidential
Advisor, a mediator, a hearing officer, or un-
paid staff), including files, records, or notes
produced during the confidential advising,
mediation, and hearing phases of a case and
maintained by the Office, the Confidential
Advisor, the mediator, or the hearing officer.
(b) Initial Disclosure. Within 14 days after
the prehearing conference in cases com-
menced by the filing of a claim pursuant to
section 402(a) of the Act, and except as other-
wise stipulated or ordered by the Merits
Hearing Officer (the hearing officer ap-
pointed by the Executive Director to conduct
the administrative hearing), a party must,
without awaiting a discovery request, pro-
vide to the other parties: the name and, if
known, mail and e-mail addresses, and tele-
phone number of each individual likely to
have discoverable information that the dis-
closing party may use to support its causes
of action or defenses; and a copy or a descrip-
tion by category and location of all docu-
ments, electronically stored information,
and tangible things that the disclosing party
has in its possession, custody, or control and
may use to support its claims or defenses.
(c) Discovery Availability. Pursuant to sec-
tion 405(e) of the Act, reasonable prehearing
discovery may be permitted at the Merits
Hearing Officer’s discretion.
(1) The parties may take discovery by one
or more of the following methods: deposi-
tions upon oral examination or written ques-
tions; written interrogatories; production of
documents or things or permission to enter
upon land or other property for inspection or
other purposes; physical and mental exami-
nations; and requests for admissions. Noth-
ing in section 415(d) of the Act—dealing with
reimbursements by Members of Congress of
amounts paid as settlements and awards—
may be construed to require the claimant to
be deposed by counsel for the intervening
member in a deposition that is separate from
any other deposition taken from the claim-
ant in connection with the hearing or civil
action.
(2) The Merits Hearing Officer may adopt
standing orders or make any order setting
forth the forms and extent of discovery, in-
cluding orders limiting the number of depo-
sitions, interrogatories, and requests for pro-
duction of documents, and also may limit
the length of depositions.
(3) The Merits Hearing Officer may issue
any other order to prevent discovery or dis-
closure of confidential or privileged mate-
rials or information, as well as hearing or
trial preparation materials and any other in-
formation deemed not discoverable, or to
protect a party or person from annoyance,
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden
or expense.
(d) Claims of Privilege.
(1) Information Withheld. Whenever a party
withholds information otherwise discover-
able under these Rules by claiming that it is
privileged or confidential or subject to pro-
tection as hearing or trial preparation mate-
rials, the party shall make the claim of
privilege expressly in writing and shall de-
scribe the nature of the documents, commu-
nications or things not produced or disclosed
in a manner that, without revealing whether
the information itself is privileged or pro-
tected, will enable other parties to assess the
applicability of the privilege or protection. A
party must make a claim for privilege no
later than the due date to produce the infor-
mation.
(2) Information Produced as Inadvertent Dis-
closure; Sealing All or Part of the Record. If in-
formation produced in discovery is subject to
a claim of privilege or of protection as hear-
ing preparation material, the party making
the claim of privilege may notify any party
that received the information of the claim of
privilege and the basis for it. After being no-
tified, a party must promptly return, seques-
ter, or destroy the specified information and
any copies it has; must not use or disclose
the information until the claim of privilege
is resolved; must take reasonable steps to re-
trieve the information if the party disclosed
it before being notified; and may promptly
present the information to the Merits Hear-
ing Officer or the Board under seal for a de-
termination of the claim of privilege. The
producing party must preserve the informa-
tion until the claim of privilege is resolved.
§ 6.02 Request for Subpoena.
(a) Authority to Issue Subpoenas. At the re-
quest of a party, the Merits Hearing Officer
may issue subpoenas for the attendance and
testimony of witnesses and for the produc-
tion of correspondence, books, papers, docu-
ments, or other records. The attendance of
witnesses and the production of records may
be required from any place within the United
States. However, no subpoena shall be issued
for the attendance or testimony of an em-
ployee or agent of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights (including but not
limited to a Board member, the Executive
Director, the General Counsel, a Confidential
Advisor, a mediator, a hearing officer, or un-
paid staff), or for the production of files,
records, or notes produced during the con-
fidential advising process, in mediation, or
at the hearing. Employing offices shall make
their employees available for discovery and
hearing without requiring a subpoena.
* * * * *
(b) Request. A request to issue a subpoena
requiring the attendance and testimony of
witnesses or the production of documents or
other evidence under paragraph (a) above
shall be submitted to the Merits Hearing Of-
ficer at least 15 days before the scheduled
hearing date. If the subpoena is sought as
part of the discovery process, the request
shall be submitted to the Merits Hearing Of-
ficer at least 10 days before the date that a
witness must attend a deposition or the date
for the production of documents. The Merits
Hearing Officer may waive the time limits
stated above for good cause.
(c) Forms and Showing. Requests for sub-
poenas shall be submitted in writing to the
Merits Hearing Officer and shall specify with
particularity the witness, correspondence,

desired and shall be supported by a showing
of general relevance and reasonable scope.
(d) Rulings. The Merits Hearing Officer
shall promptly rule on subpoena requests.
§ 6.03 Service.
Subpoenas shall be served in the manner
provided under Rule 45(b) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Service of a sub-
poena may be made by any person who is
over 18 years of age and is not a party to the
proceeding.
§ 6.04 Proof of Service.
When service of a subpoena is effected, the
person serving the subpoena shall certify the
date and the manner of service. The party on
whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall
file the server’s certification with the Merits
Hearing Officer.
§ 6.05 Motion to Quash or Limit.
Any person against whom a subpoena is di-
rected may file a motion to quash or limit
the subpoena setting forth the reasons why
the subpoena should not be complied with or
why it should be limited in scope. This mo-
tion shall be filed with the Merits Hearing
Officer before the time specified in the sub-
poena for compliance and not later than 10
days after service of the subpoena. The Mer-
its Hearing Officer should promptly rule on a
motion to quash or limit and ensure that the
person receiving the subpoena is made aware
of the ruling.
§ 6.06 Enforcement.
(a) Objections and Requests for Enforcement.
If a person has been served with a subpoena
pursuant to section 6.03 of the Rules, but
fails or refuses to comply with its terms or
otherwise objects to it, the party or person
objecting or the party seeking compliance
may seek a ruling from the Merits Hearing
Officer. The request for a ruling shall be sub-
mitted in writing to the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer. However, it may be made orally on the
record at the hearing at the discretion of the
Merits Hearing Officer. The party seeking
compliance shall present the proof of service
and, except when the witness was required to
appear before the Merits Hearing Officer,
shall submit evidence, by affidavit or dec-
laration, of the failure or refusal to obey the
subpoena.
(b) Ruling by the Merits Hearing Officer.
(1) The Merits Hearing Officer shall
promptly rule on the request for enforce-
ment and/or the objection(s).
(2) On request of the objecting witness or
any party, the Merits Hearing Officer shall—
or on the Hearing Officer’s own initiative,
the Hearing Officer may—refer the ruling to
the Board for review.
(c) Review by the Board. The Board may
overrule, modify, remand, or affirm the Mer-
its Hearing Officer’s ruling and, in its discre-
tion, may direct the General Counsel to
apply in the name of the Office for an order
from a United States district court to en-
force the subpoena.
(d) Application to an Appropriate Court; Civil
Contempt. If a person fails to comply with a
subpoena, the Board may direct the General
Counsel to apply, in the name of the Office,
to an appropriate United States district
court for an order requiring that person to
appear before the Merits Hearing Officer to
give testimony or produce records. Any fail-
ure to obey a lawful order of the district
court may be held by such court to be a civil
contempt thereof.
§ 6.07 Requirements for Sworn Statements.
Any time that the Office and/or a Hearing
Officer requires an affidavit or sworn state-
ment from a party or a witness, he or she
should refer the party or witness to a sample
declaration under 28 U.S.C. § 1746, which sub-
stantially requires:
(a) If executed within the United States,
its territories, possessions, or common-
wealths: ‘‘I declare (or certify, verify, or
state) under penalty of perjury that the fore-
going is true and correct. Executed on (date).
(Signature).’’
(b) If executed outside the United States:
‘‘I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under
penalty of perjury under the laws of the
United States of America that the foregoing
is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Sig-
nature).’’
SUBPART G—[AMENDED]
[Table of Contents Omitted]
Revise subpart G to read as follows:
§ 7.01 The Merits Hearing Officer.
This subpart concerns the duties and re-
sponsibilities of Merits Hearing Officers, who
are appointed by the Executive Director to
preside over the administrative hearings

ities of Preliminary Hearing Officers are
contained in section 5.08 of these Rules.

ing Officer may exercise authority as pro-
vided in subparagraph (b) of this section

tion 6.02 of these Rules;

evant evidence;

priate under sections 6.01 to 6.06 of these
Rules;

fying issues and settlement;

late the course of the hearing, and maintain
decorum at and exclude from the hearing

rupt, that decorum;
(8) exclude from the hearing any person,
except any claimant, any party, the attorney
or representative of any claimant or party,
or any witness while testifying;
(9) rule on all motions, witness and exhibit
lists, and proposed findings, including mo-
tions for summary judgment;
(10) require the filing of briefs, memoranda
of law, and the presentation of oral argu-
ment as to any question of fact or law;
(11) order the production of evidence and

which relief may be granted;
(15) maintain and enforce the confiden-
tiality of proceedings; and
(16) waive or modify any procedural re-
quirements of subparts F and G of these
Rules so long as permitted by the Act.
§ 7.02 Sanctions.
(a) When necessary to regulate the course
of the proceedings (including the hearing),
the Merits Hearing Officer may impose an
appropriate sanction, which may include,
but is not limited to, the sanctions specified
in this section, on the parties and/or their
representatives.
(b) The Merits Hearing Officer may impose
sanctions upon the parties and/or their rep-
resentatives based on, but not limited to, the
circumstances set forth in this section.
(1) Failure to Comply with an Order. When a
party fails to comply with an order (includ-
ing an order to submit to a deposition, to
produce evidence within the party’s control,
or to produce witnesses), the Merits Hearing
Officer may:
(A) draw an inference in favor of the re-
questing party on the issue related to the in-
formation sought;
(B) stay further proceedings until the order
is obeyed;
(C) prohibit the party failing to comply
with such order from introducing evidence
concerning, or otherwise relying upon, evi-
dence relating to the information sought;
(D) permit the requesting party to intro-
duce secondary evidence concerning the in-
formation sought;
(E) strike, in whole or in part, the claim,
briefs, answer, or other submissions of the
party failing to comply with the order, as ap-
propriate; or
(F) direct judgment against the non-com-
plying party in whole or in part.
(2) Failure to Prosecute or Defend. If a party
fails to prosecute or defend a position, the
Merits Hearing Officer may dismiss the ac-
tion with prejudice or decide the matter,
when appropriate.
(3) Failure to Make Timely Filing. The Mer-
its Hearing Officer may refuse to consider
any request, motion or other action that is
not filed in a timely fashion in compliance
with this subpart.
(4) Frivolous Claims, Defenses, and Argu-
ments. If a party or a representative files a
claim that fails to meet the requirements of
section 401(f) of the Act, the Merits Hearing
Officer may dismiss the claim, in whole or in
part, with prejudice or decide the matter for
the opposing party. If a party or a represent-
ative presents a pleading, written motion, or
other paper containing claims, defenses, and
other legal contentions for any improper
purpose, such as to harass, cause unneces-
sary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of
resolution of the matter, the Merits Hearing
Officer may reject the claims, defenses or
legal contentions, in whole or in part. A
claim, defense, or legal contention shall not
be subject to sanctions if it constitutes a
nonfrivolous argument for extending, modi-
fying, or reversing existing law or for estab-
lishing new law.
(5) Failure to Maintain Confidentiality. An
allegation regarding a violation of the con-
fidentiality provisions may be made to a
Merits Hearing Officer in proceedings under
section 405 of the Act. If, after notice and
hearing, the Merits Hearing Officer deter-
mines that a party has violated the confiden-
tiality provisions, the Merits Hearing Officer
may:
(A) direct that the matters related to the
breach of confidentiality or other designated
facts be taken as established for purposes of
the action, as the prevailing party contends;
(B) prohibit the party breaching confiden-
tiality from supporting or opposing des-
ignated claims or defenses, or from intro-
ducing designated matters in evidence;
(C) strike the pleadings in whole or in part;
(D) stay further proceedings until the
breach of confidentiality is resolved to the
extent possible;
(E) dismiss the action or proceeding in
whole or in part; or
(F) render a default judgment against the
party breaching confidentiality.
(c) No sanctions may be imposed under this
section except for good cause and the par-
ticulars of which must be stated in the sanc-
tion order.

cer considers himself or herself disqualified,

est in the case or for some other disquali-
fying reason, he or she shall withdraw from
the case, stating in writing or on the record
the reasons for his or her withdrawal, and
shall immediately notify the Office of the
withdrawal.
(b) Any party may file a motion requesting
that a Merits Hearing Officer withdraw on
the basis of personal bias or of an interest in
the case or for some other disqualifying rea-
son. This motion shall specifically set forth
the reasons supporting the request and be
filed as soon as the party has reason to be-
lieve that there is a basis for disqualifica-
tion.
(c) The Merits Hearing Officer shall
promptly rule on the withdrawal motion. If
the motion is granted, the Executive Direc-
tor will appoint another Merits Hearing Offi-
cer within 5 days. Any objection to the Mer-
its Hearing Officer’s ruling on the with-
drawal motion shall not be deemed waived
by a party’s further participation in the
hearing and may be the basis for an appeal
to the Board from the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer’s decision under section 8.01 of these
Rules. Such objection will not stay the con-
duct of the hearing.
§ 7.04 Motions and Prehearing Conference.
(a) Motions. Motions shall be filed with the
Merits Hearing Officer and shall be in writ-
ing except for oral motions made on the
record during the hearing. All written mo-
tions and any responses to them shall in-
clude a proposed order, when applicable.
Only with the Merits Hearing Officer’s ad-
vance approval may either party file addi-
tional responses to the motion or to the re-
sponse to the motion. Motions for extension
of time will be granted only for good cause
shown.
(b) Scheduling the Prehearing Conference.
Within 7 days after a Merits Hearing Officer
is assigned to adjudicate the claim(s), the
Merits Hearing Officer shall serve on the par-
ties and their designated representatives
written notice setting forth the time, date,
and place of the prehearing conference, ex-
cept that the Executive Director may, for
good cause, extend up to an additional 7 days
the time for serving notice of the prehearing
conference.
(c) Prehearing Conference Memoranda. The
Merits Hearing Officer may order each party
to prepare a prehearing conference memo-
randum. The Merits Hearing Officer may di-
rect that a memorandum be filed after dis-
covery has concluded. The memorandum
may include:
(1) the major factual contentions and legal
issues that the party intends to raise at the
hearing in short, successive, and numbered
paragraphs, along with any proposed stipula-
tions of fact or law;
(2) an estimate of the time necessary for
presenting the party’s case;
(3) the specific relief, including, when
known, a calculation of any monetary relief
or damages that is being or will be re-
quested;
(4) the names of potential witnesses for the
party’s case, except for potential impeach-
ment or rebuttal witnesses, and the purpose
for which they will be called and a list of
documents that the party is seeking from
the opposing party, and, if discovery was per-
mitted, the status of any pending request for
discovery. (It is not necessary to list each
document requested. Instead, the party may
refer to the request for discovery.); and
(5) a brief description of any other unre-
solved issues.
(d) At the prehearing conference, the Mer-
its Hearing Officer may discuss the subjects
specified in paragraph (c) above and the
manner in which the hearing will be con-
ducted. In addition, the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer may explore settlement possibilities and
consider how the factual and legal issues
might be simplified and any other issues
that might expedite resolving the dispute.
The Merits Hearing Officer shall issue an
order, which recites the actions taken at the
conference and the parties’ agreements as to
any matters considered, and which limits the
issues to those not disposed of by the parties’
admissions, stipulations, or agreements.
Such order, when entered, shall control the
course of the proceeding, subject to later
modification by the Merits Hearing Officer
by his or her own motion or upon proper re-
quest of a party for good cause shown.
§ 7.05 Scheduling the Hearing.
(a) Date, Time, and Place of Hearing. The Of-
fice shall issue the notice of hearing, which
shall fix the date, time, and place of hearing.
Absent a postponement granted by the Of-
fice, a hearing must commence no later than
60 days after the filing of the claim(s).
(b) Motions for Postponement or a Continu-
ance. Motions for postponement or for a con-
tinuance by either party shall be made in
writing to the Merits Hearing Officer, shall
set forth the reasons for the request, and
shall state whether or not the opposing party
consents to such postponement. A Merits
Hearing Officer may grant such a motion
upon a showing of good cause. In no event
will a hearing commence later than 90 days
after the filing of the claim form.
§ 7.06 Consolidation and Joinder of Cases.
(a) Explanation.
(1) Consolidation is when two or more par-
ties have cases that might be treated as one
because they contain identical or similar
issues or in such other appropriate cir-
cumstances.
(2) Joinder is when one party has two or
more cases pending and they are united for
consideration. For example, joinder might be
warranted when a single party has one case
pending challenging a 30–day suspension and
another case pending challenging a subse-
quent dismissal.
(b) Authority. The Executive Director (be-
fore assigning a Merits Hearing Officer to ad-
judicate a claim); a Merits Hearing Officer
(during the hearing); or the Board (during an
appeal) may consolidate or join cases on
their own initiative or on the motion of a
party if to do so would expedite case proc-
essing and not adversely affect the parties’
interests, taking into account the confiden-
tiality requirements of section 416 of the
Act.
§ 7.07 Conduct of Hearing; Disqualifying a
Representative.
(a) Pursuant to section 405(d)(1) of the Act,
the Merits Hearing Officer shall conduct the
hearing in closed session on the record. Only
the Merits Hearing Officer, the parties and
their representatives, and witnesses during
the time they are testifying, shall be per-
mitted to attend the hearing, except that the
Office may not be precluded from observing
the hearing. The Merits Hearing Officer, or a
person designated by the Merits Hearing Of-
ficer or the Executive Director, shall record
the proceedings.
(b) The hearing shall be conducted as an
administrative proceeding. Witnesses shall
testify under oath or affirmation. Except as
specified in the Act and in these Rules, the
Merits Hearing Officer shall conduct the
hearing, to the greatest extent practicable,
consistent with the principles and proce-
dures in sections 554 through 557 of title 5 of
the United States Code (the Administrative
Procedure Act).
(c) No later than the opening of the hear-
ing, or as otherwise ordered by the Merits
Hearing Officer, each party shall submit to
the Merits Hearing Officer and to the oppos-
ing party typed lists of the hearing exhibits
and the witnesses expected to be called to
testify, excluding impeachment or rebuttal
witnesses.
(d) At the commencement of the hearing,
or as otherwise ordered by the Merits Hear-
ing Officer, the Merits Hearing Officer may
consider any stipulations of facts and law
pursuant to section 7.10 of the Rules, take of-
ficial notice of certain facts pursuant to sec-
tion 7.11 of the Rules, rule on the parties’ ob-
jections and hear witness testimony. Each
party must present his or her case in a con-
cise manner, limiting the testimony of wit-
nesses and submission of documents to rel-
evant matters.
(e) Any evidentiary objection not timely
made before a Merits Hearing Officer shall,
absent clear error, be deemed waived on ap-
peal to the Board.
(f) Failure of either party to appear at the
hearing, to present witnesses, or to respond
to an evidentiary order may result in an ad-
verse finding or ruling by the Merits Hearing
Officer. At the Merits Hearing Officer’s dis-
cretion, the hearing also may be held with-
out the claimant if the claimant’s represent-
ative is present.
(g) If the Merits Hearing Officer concludes
that an employee’s representative, a witness,
a charging party, a labor organization, an
employing office, or an entity alleged to be
responsible for correcting a violation has a
conflict of interest, the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer may, after giving the representative an
opportunity to respond, disqualify the rep-
resentative. In that event, within the time
limits for hearing and decision established
by the Act, the affected party shall be af-
forded reasonable time to retain other rep-
resentation.
§ 7.08 Transcript.
(a) Preparation. The Office shall keep an ac-
curate electronic or stenographic hearing
record, which shall be the sole official record
of the proceeding. The Office shall be respon-
sible for the cost of transcribing the hearing.
Upon request, a copy of the hearing tran-
script shall be furnished to each party, pro-
vided, however, that such party has first
agreed to maintain and respect the confiden-
tiality of such transcript in accordance with
the applicable rules prescribed by the Office
or the Merits Hearing Officer to effectuate
section 416(b) of the Act. Additional copies of
transcripts shall be made available to a
party at the party’s expense. The Office may
grant exceptions to the payment require-
ment for good cause shown. A motion for an
exception shall be made in writing, accom-
panied by an affidavit or a declaration set-
ting forth the reasons for the request, and
submitted to the Office. Requests for copies
of transcripts also shall be directed to the
Office. The Office may, by agreement with
the person making the request, arrange with
the official hearing reporter for required
services to be charged to the requester.
(b) Corrections. Corrections to the official
transcript of the hearing will be permitted.
Motions for correction must be submitted
within 10 days of service of the transcript
upon the parties. Corrections to the official
transcript will be permitted only upon the
approval of the Merits Hearing Officer. The
Merits Hearing Officer may make correc-
tions at any time with notice to the parties.
§ 7.09 Admissibility of Evidence.
The Merits Hearing Officer shall apply the
Federal Rules of Evidence to the greatest ex-
tent practicable. These Rules provide, among
other things, that the Merits Hearing Officer
may exclude evidence if, among other things,
it constitutes inadmissible hearsay or its
probative value is substantially outweighed
by the danger of unfair prejudice, by confu-
sion of the issues, or by considerations of

undue delay, waste of time, or needless pres-
entation of cumulative evidence.
§ 7.10 Stipulations.
The parties may stipulate as to any matter
of fact. Such a stipulation will satisfy a par-
ty’s burden of proving the fact alleged.
§ 7.11 Official Notice.
(a) The Merits Hearing Officer on his or her
own motion or on motion of a party, may
take official notice of a fact that is not sub-
ject to reasonable dispute because it is ei-
ther:
(1) a matter of common knowledge; or
(2) capable of accurate and ready deter-
mination by resort to sources whose accu-
racy cannot reasonably be questioned. Offi-
cial notice taken of any fact satisfies a par-
ty’s burden of proving the fact noticed.
(b) When a decision, or part thereof, rests
on the official notice of a material fact not
appearing in the evidence in the record, the
fact of official notice shall be so stated in
the decision, and any party, upon timely re-
quest, shall be afforded an opportunity to
show the contrary.
§ 7.12 Confidentiality.
(a) Pursuant to section 416 of the Act and
section 1.08 of these Rules, all proceedings
and deliberations of Merits Hearing Officers
and the Board, including the hearing tran-
scripts and any related records, shall be con-
fidential, except as specified in sections
416(c), (d), (e), and (f) of the Act and subpara-
graph 1.08(d) of these Rules. All parties to
the proceeding and their representatives, and
witnesses who appear at the hearing, will be
advised of the importance of confidentiality
in this process and of their obligations, sub-
ject to sanctions, to maintain it. This provi-
sion shall not apply to proceedings under
section 215 of the Act, but shall apply to the
Merits Hearing Officers’ and the Board’s de-
liberations under that section.
(b) Violation of Confidentiality. A Merits
Hearing Officer, under section 405 of the Act,
may resolve an alleged violation of confiden-
tiality that occurred during a hearing. After
providing notice and an opportunity to the
parties to be heard, the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer, under subparagraph 1.08(f) of these
Rules, may find a violation of confiden-
tiality and impose appropriate procedural or
evidentiary sanctions, to include the sanc-
tions listed in section 7.02 of these Rules.
§ 7.13 Immediate Board Review of a Hearing
Officer’s Ruling.
(a) Review Strongly Disfavored. Board review
of a Merits Hearing Officer’s ruling is strong-
ly disfavored while a proceeding is ongoing
(an ‘‘interlocutory appeal’’). In general, the
Board may consider a request for interlocu-
tory appeal only if the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer, on his or her own motion or by motion
of the parties, determines that the issue pre-
sented is of such importance to the pro-
ceeding that it requires the Board’s imme-
diate attention.
(b) Time for Filing. A party must file a mo-
tion for interlocutory appeal of a Merits
Hearing Officer’s ruling with the Merits
Hearing Officer within 5 days after service of
the ruling upon the parties. The motion shall
include arguments in support of both inter-
locutory appeal and the requested deter-
mination to be made by the Board upon re-
view. Responses, if any, shall be filed with
the Hearing Officer within 3 days after serv-
ice of the motion.
(c) Standards for Review. In determining
whether to certify and forward a request for
interlocutory appeal to the Board, the Mer-
its Hearing Officer shall consider the fol-
lowing:
(1) whether the ruling involves a signifi-
cant question of law or policy about which
there is substantial ground for difference of
opinion;
(2) whether an immediate Board review of
the Merits Hearing Officer’s ruling will ma-
terially advance completing the proceeding;
and
(3) whether denial of immediate review will
cause undue harm to a party or the public.
(d) Merits Hearing Officer Action. If all the
conditions set forth in paragraph (c) above
are met, the Merits Hearing Officer shall cer-
tify and forward a request for interlocutory
appeal to the Board for its immediate con-
sideration. Any such submission shall ex-
plain the basis on which the Merits Hearing
Officer concluded that the standards in para-
graph (c) have been met. The Merits Hearing
Officer’s decision to forward or decline to
forward a request for review is not appeal-
able.
(e) Granting or Denying an Interlocutory Ap-
peal is Within the Board’s Sole Discretion. The
Board, in its sole discretion, may grant or
deny an interlocutory appeal, upon the Mer-
its Hearing Officer’s certification and deci-
sion to forward a request for review. The
Board’s decision to grant or deny an inter-
locutory appeal is not appealable.
(f) Stay Pending Interlocutory Appeal. Unless
otherwise directed by the Board, the stay of
any proceedings during the pendency of ei-
ther a request for interlocutory appeal or the
appeal itself shall be within the Merits Hear-
ing Officer’s discretion, provided that no
stay shall serve to toll the time limits set
forth in section 405(d) of the Act. If the Mer-
its Hearing Officer does not stay the pro-
ceedings, the Board may do so while an in-
terlocutory appeal is pending with it.
(g) Procedures before the Board. Upon its de-
cision to grant interlocutory appeal, the
Board shall issue an order setting forth the
procedures that will be followed in the con-
duct of that review.
(h) Appeal of a Final Decision. Denial of in-
terlocutory appeal will not affect a party’s
right to challenge rulings, which are other-
wise appealable, as part of an appeal to the
Board under section 8.01 of the Rules from
the Merits Hearing Officer’s decision issued
under section 7.16 of these Rules.
§ 7.14 Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclu-
sions of Law; Posthearing Briefs.
May be Required. The Merits Hearing Offi-
cer may require the parties to file proposed
findings of fact and conclusions of law and/or
posthearing briefs on the factual and the
legal issues presented in the case.
§ 7.15 Closing the Record.
(a) Except as provided in section 7.14 of the
Rules, the record shall close when the hear-
ing ends. However, the Hearing Officer may
hold the record open as necessary to allow
the parties to submit arguments, briefs, doc-
uments or additional evidence previously
identified for introduction.
(b) Once the record is closed, no additional
evidence or argument shall be accepted into
the hearing record except upon a showing
that new and material evidence has become
available that was not available despite due
diligence before the record closed or that the
additional evidence or argument is being
provided in rebuttal to new evidence or argu-
ment that the other party submitted just be-
fore the record closed. The Merits Hearing
Officer also shall make part of the record an
approved correction to the transcript.
§ 7.16 Merits Hearing Officer Decisions; Entry
in Office Records; Corrections to the
Record; Motions to Alter, Amend, or Va-
cate the Decision.
(a) The Merits Hearing Officer shall issue a
written decision no later than 90 days after
the hearing ends, pursuant to section 405(g)
of the Act.
(b) The Merits Hearing Officer’s written de-
cision shall:
(1) state the issues raised in the claim(s),
form, or complaint;
(2) describe the evidence in the record;
(3) contain findings of fact and conclusions
of law, and the reasons or bases therefore, on
all the material issues of fact, law, or discre-
tion presented on the record;
(4) determine whether a violation has oc-
curred; and
(5) order such remedies as are appropriate
under the Act.
(c) If a final decision concerns a claim al-
leging a violation or violations described in
section 415(d)(1)(C) of the Act, the written
decision shall include the following findings:
(1) whether the alleged violation or viola-
tions occurred;
(2) whether any violation or violations
found to have occurred were committed per-
sonally by an individual who, at the time of
committing the violation, was a Member of
the House of Representatives (including a
Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the
Congress) or a Senator;
(3) the amount of compensatory damages,
if any, awarded pursuant to section
415(d)(1)(B) of the Act; and
(4) the amount, if any, of compensatory
damages that is the ‘‘reimbursable portion’’
as defined by section 415(d) of the Act.
(d) Upon issuance, the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer’s decision and order shall be entered into
the Office’s records.
(e) The Office shall promptly provide a
copy of the Merits Hearing Officer’s decision
and order to the parties.
(f) If there is no appeal of a Merits Hearing
Officer’s decision and order, that decision be-
comes a final decision of the Office, which is
subject to enforcement under section 8.03 of
these Rules.
(g) Corrections to the Record. After a Merits
Hearing Officer’s decision has been issued,
but before an appeal is made to the Board, or
absent an appeal, before the decision be-
comes final, the Merits Hearing Officer may
issue an erratum notice to correct simple er-
rors or easily correctible mistakes. The Mer-
its Hearing Officer may do so on the parties’
motion or on his or her own motion with or
without advance notice.
(h) After a Merits Hearing Officer’s deci-
sion has been issued, but before an appeal is
made to the Board, or absent an appeal, be-
fore the decision becomes final, a party to
the proceeding before the Merits Hearing Of-
ficer may move to alter, amend, or vacate
the decision. The moving party must estab-
lish that relief from the decision is war-
ranted because: (1) of mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) there is
newly discovered evidence that, with reason-
able diligence, could not have been discov-
ered in time to move for a new hearing; (3)
there has been fraud (misrepresentation, or
misconduct by an opposing party); (4) the de-
cision is void; or (5) the decision has been
satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based
on an earlier decision that has been reversed
or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no
longer equitable. The motion shall be filed
within 15 days after service of the Merits
Hearing Officer’s decision. No response shall
be filed unless the Merits Hearing Officer so
orders. The filing and pendency of a motion
under this provision shall not relieve a party
of the obligation to file a timely appeal or
operate to stay the Merits Hearing Officer’s
action unless the Merits Hearing Officer so
orders.

SUBPART I—[AMENDED]
[Table of Contents Omitted]
1. Amend section 9.01 by:
(a) Revising paragraph (a); and
(b) Adding a new paragraph (c).
The revisions read as follows:
§ 9.01 Attorney’s Fees and Costs.
(a) Request. No later than 30 days after the
entry of a final decision of the Office, the
prevailing party may submit to the Merits
Hearing Officer who decided the case a mo-
tion for the award of reasonable attorney’s
fees and costs, following the form specified
in paragraph (b) below. The Merits Hearing
Officer, after giving the respondent an oppor-
tunity to reply, shall rule on the motion. De-
cisions regarding attorney’s fees and costs
are collateral and do not affect the finality
or appealability of a final decision issued by
the Office.
* * * * *
(c) Arbitration Awards. In arbitration pro-
ceedings, the prevailing party must submit
any request for attorney’s fees and costs to
the arbitrator in accordance with the estab-
lished arbitration procedures.

§ 9.02 Ex Parte Communications.
* * * * *
(b) Exception to Coverage. The Rules set

* * * * *
3. Revise section 9.03 as follows:
§ 9.03 Informal Resolutions and Settlement
Agreements.
(a) Informal Resolution. At any time before
a covered employee files a claim form under
section 402 of the Act, a covered employee
and the employing office, on their own, may
agree voluntarily and informally to resolve a
dispute. Any informal resolution shall be in-
effective to the extent that it purports to:
(1) constitute a waiver of a covered em-
ployee’s rights under the Act; or
(2) create an obligation that is payable
from the account established by section
415(a) of the Act (‘‘Section 415(a) Treasury
Account’’) or enforceable by the Office.
(b) * * * * *
(c) General Requirements for Formal Settle-
ment Agreements. A formal settlement agree-
ment must contain the signatures of all par-
ties or their designated representatives on
the agreement document. A formal settle-
ment agreement cannot be approved by the
Executive Director until the appropriate rev-
ocation periods have expired and the employ-
ing office has fully completed and submitted
the Office’s Section 415(a) Account Requisi-
tion Form. A formal settlement agreement
cannot be rescinded after the signatures of
all parties have been affixed to the agree-
ment, unless by written revocation of the
agreement voluntarily signed by all parties,
or as otherwise permitted by law. All formal
settlement agreements must also:
(1) specify the amount of each payment to
be made from the Section 415(a) Treasury
Account;
(2) identify the portion of any payment
that is subject to the reimbursement provi-
sions of section 415(e) of the Act because it is
being used to settle an alleged violation of
section 201(a) or 206(a) of the Act;
(3) identify each payment that is back pay
and indicate the net amount that will be
paid to the employee after tax withholding
and authorized deductions; and
(4) certify that, except for funds to correct
alleged violations of sections 201(a)(3), 210, or
215 of the Act, only funds from the Section
415(a) Treasury Account will be used for the
payment of any amount specified in the set-
tlement agreement.
(d) Requirements for Formal Settlement Agree-
ments Involving Claims against Members of
Congress. If a formal settlement agreement
concerns allegations against a Member of
Congress subject to the payment reimburse-
ment provisions of section 415(d) of the Act,
the settlement agreement must comply with
subparagraphs 9.03(c)(1), (3) and (4) of these
Rules, and:
(1) specify the amount, if any, that is the
‘‘reimbursable portion’’ as defined by section
415(d) of the Act; and
(2) contain the signature of any individual
(or the representative of any individual) who
has exercised his or her right to intervene
pursuant to section 414(d)(8) of the Act.
(e) * * * * *
3. Revise section 9.04 as follows:
§ 9.04 Payments Required Pursuant to Deci-
sions, Awards, or Settlements under Sec-
tion 415(a) of the Act.
(a) In General. Whenever an award or set-
tlement requires the payment of funds pur-
suant to section 415(a) of the Act, the award
or settlement must be submitted to the Ex-
ecutive Director together with a fully com-
pleted Section 415(a) Account Requisition
Form for processing by the Office.
(b) Requesting Payments.
(1) Only an employing office under section
101 of the Act may submit a payment request
from the Section 415(a) Treasury Account.
(2) Employing offices must submit requests
for payments from the Section 415(a) Treas-
ury Account on the Office’s Section 415(a)
Account Requisition Forms.
(c) Duty to Cooperate. Each employment of-
fice has a duty to cooperate with the Execu-
tive Director or his or her designee by
promptly responding to any requests for in-
formation and to otherwise assist the Execu-
tive Director in providing prompt payments
from the Section 415(a) Treasury Account.
Failure to cooperate may be grounds for dis-
approval of the settlement agreement.
(d) Back Pay. When the award or settle-
ment specifies a payment as back pay, the
gross amount of the back pay will be paid to
the employing office and the employing of-
fice will then promptly issue amounts rep-
resenting back pay (and interest if author-
ized) to the employee and retain amounts
representing withholding and deductions.
(e) Attorney’s fees. When the award or set-
tlement specifies a payment as attorney’s
fees, the attorney’s fees are paid directly to
the attorney from the Section 415(a) Treas-
ury Account.
(f) Tax Reporting and Withholding Obliga-
tions. The Office does not report Section
415(a) Treasury Account payments as poten-
tial taxable income to the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) and is not responsible for tax
withholding or reporting. To the extent that
W–2 or 1099 forms need to be issued, it is the
responsibility of the employing office sub-
mitting the payment request to do so. The
employing office should also consult IRS
regulations for guidance in reporting the
amount of any back pay award as wages on
a W–2 Form.
(g) Method of Payment. Section 415(a)
Treasury Account payments are made by
electronic funds transfer. The Office will
issue an electronic payment to the payee’s
account as specified on the appropriate Sec-
tion 415(a) Treasury Account form.
(h) Reimbursement of the Section 415(a)
Treasury Account.
(1) Members of Congress. Section 415(d) of
the Act requires Members of the House of
Representatives and the Senate to reimburse
the ‘‘compensatory damages’’ portion of a
decision, award or settlement for a violation
of section 201(a), 206(a), or 207 that the Mem-
ber is found to have ‘‘committed person-
ally.’’ Reimbursement shall be in accordance
with the timetable and procedures estab-
lished by the applicable congressional com-
mittee for the withholding of amounts from
the compensation of an individual who is a
Member of the House of Representatives or a
Senator.
(2) Other Employing Offices. Section 415(e) of
the Act requires employing offices (other
than an employing office of the House or
Senate) to reimburse awards and settlements

Let us pray.
Almighty God, You know all about

of Your loving providence. Thank you
for the gift of freedom to choose. Help
us to use Your admonition as a lamp
for our feet and a light for our path.
Guide our lawmakers. Bring their
hearts under Your control as You in-
fuse them with a deeper love for You
and humanity. May they seek to cause
justice to roll down like waters and
righteousness like a mighty stream.
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Later today, the
Senate will vote to advance the nomi-
nation of Daniel Domenico to serve as
U.S. District Judge for the District of
Colorado.
After we vote on his confirmation, we
will do the same for Patrick Wyrick,
nominated to a vacancy in the Western
District of Oklahoma.
Mr. Wyrick is a two-time graduate of
the University of Oklahoma and held a
clerkship in the Eastern District of
Oklahoma at the outset of his legal ca-
reer. That career included time in pri-
vate practice, as the State’s Solicitor
General and, most recently, as Asso-
ciate Justice of the Oklahoma Supreme
Court.
I am sorry to say that this week will
mark 1 year since Mr. Wyrick’s nomi-
nation was first received in the Senate.
I hope each of my colleagues will join
me in long-overdue support for its
prompt consideration on the floor.
Over the course of the week, as I
have outlined, we will consider four
other well-qualified nominees who have
been waiting on the Executive Cal-
endar for far too long. We will build on
the action taken last week to restore
some reason and sanity to the nomina-
tions process, which has suffered in re-
cent years under the burden of partisan
obstruction.
Before the week is through, we will
also turn to the nomination of David
Bernhardt to lead the Department of
the Interior. The Senate has confirmed
Mr. Bernhardt twice before to serve
that Department as Deputy Secretary
and as Solicitor. When you hear the
nominee and review his credentials, it
is easy to see why. Mr. Bernhardt has
significant private practice experience,
as well as a past record of service at
the Department.
Along the way he has earned the re-
spect of those who rely on the public
lands the Department of the Interior is
charged to oversee, from Native Amer-
ican leaders to sportsmen’s groups. He
has been praised as a ‘‘proven leader’’
who ‘‘act[s] with integrity’’ and has
‘‘the right approach and skill set.’’
I hope each of my colleagues will join
me in voting to confirm him later this
week.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2298 April 9, 2019
understand, they will soon introduce
the Senate version of the radical
healthcare proposal that I have come
to call Medicare for None.
It is only the latest installment in
the steady drumbeat of calls for social-
ist central planning that we have been
hearing from our Democratic col-
leagues as of late.
Earlier this year, we saw the Speaker
of the House declare her top priority as
the Democrat politician protection act,
an effort to literally rewrite the rules
of free speech in American elections
and give political campaigns a big dose
of taxpayer dollars, all so the outcome
of the political process could be more
to the Democrats’ liking.
We have seen all but a tiny handful
of our Democratic colleagues unable to
reject an absurdly intrusive and mind-
bogglingly expensive plan to forcibly
remodel the U.S. economy and Amer-
ican families’ lives until they are suffi-
ciently ‘‘green.’’
Now, perhaps as soon as this week,
the latest new scheme will make land-
fall in the Senate. I am sure it will
grab a new round of headlines, but
under the Cadillac hood, it will offer
only the same old push mower engine,
the same tired, debunked logic that
Washington knows best and the Amer-
ican people can’t be trusted to decide
what is best for themselves and their
families.
That tired, old engine cannot power
the kind of healthcare that Americans
deserve. The legislation my colleagues
want to brand as Medicare for All hol-
lows out the actual Medicare Program
that our seniors rely on until the only
thing left is the label. Then it takes
that label and slaps it on a brandnew,
untested, government-run plan that
every single American would be forced
into—forced into—whether they like it
or not. In fact, competing private in-
surance policies, such as the ones that
180 million Americans currently use,
would be banned outright—gone.
For the privilege of having their ex-
isting Medicare or existing employer-
provided plans ripped away from them
by the same old Washington experts
who brought us ObamaCare with sky-
high premiums and deductibles, out-of-
pocket costs, and dysfunction—for that
privilege the American people would
have to pick up a historic $32 trillion
tab. That is just the rough estimate for
the first 10 years—$32 trillion over 10
years. That is more than the Federal
Government has spent on everything—
everything—over the past 8 years com-
bined. It is so much that even senior
Democrats aren’t claiming to know
how it will be paid for. That price is so
steep that even left-leaning analysts
are admitting that the tax burden is
virtually certain to land on the shoul-
ders of the middle class.
Here is the Washington Post, ver-
batim: ‘‘Medicare-for-all in particular
would require tax hikes on middle class
families.’’
To give you a sense of scale for this
nightmare, one think tank has cal-
culated that ‘‘doubling all Federal in-
dividual and corporate income taxes’’—
doubling them—‘‘would be insufficient
to fully finance the plan.’’
Doubling all of the corporate and in-
dividual income taxes would be insuffi-
cient to fully finance the plan. Dou-
bling what Americans send to the IRS
in income taxes would take away all of
the competition and choice in the
health insurance market. The failures
and foibles of ObamaCare, as painful as
they are for so many families, would
likely be just the warmup act to this
socialist bonanza.
Apparently this is what my Demo-
cratic colleagues believe will pass for a
political winner. We are looking for-
ward to that debate.
I will give them this: With Repub-
licans standing for preserving what
works and fixing what doesn’t, for re-
ducing tax rates instead of shooting
them sky-high, and for strengthening
the employer-sponsored and Medicare
Advantage plans that American fami-
lies actually rely on instead of snatch-
ing those plans away, my Democratic
friends are certainly working hard to
paint a contrast—and we welcome it.
S. 1057
Madam President, on one final mat-
ter, even as the Senate grapples with
these kinds of major disagreements, I
want to highlight that there were still
bipartisan accomplishments constantly
coming out of this Chamber. They
don’t always make national front-page
news, but they often represent hugely
significant progress for the American
people.
Just yesterday afternoon, the Senate
passed legislation from Senator MAR-
THA MCSALLY to formalize a landmark
drought contingency plan for the Colo-
rado River Basin. Our Senate col-
leagues from the West have been work-
ing with State and local leaders lit-
erally for years to develop this bipar-
tisan, bicameral solution. Seven
States, countless local and Tribal au-
thorities, and both the United States
and Mexico have skin in this game, so
hammering out this coordinated plan
was no small feat.
Now that this agreement will be codi-
fied in Federal law, tens of millions of
Americans will be able to rest easier,
knowing that their supply of drinking
water and irrigation will be better pro-
tected from water shortages.
I want to congratulate all of our col-
leagues who worked hard to make this
happen, particularly Senator MCSALLY
and Senator GARDNER, who have been
strong voices for this agreement and
the people of Arizona and Colorado. I
look forward to the President signing
this into law in the very near future.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

H.R. 1602
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, there
is one thing pretty much every Amer-
ican can agree on. It is that illegal
robocalls are a major nuisance. Who
hasn’t been annoyed after answering
the phone and discovering it is an auto-
mated message asking you to purchase
some product or provide sensitive per-
sonal information?
But, of course, these calls aren’t
merely a nuisance. Scammers use these
calls to successfully prey on vulnerable
populations, like the elderly, who may
be less technologically savvy. It is no
surprise that people are deceived. I
think most of us have received
robocalls that sounded pretty credible,
and the practice of spoofing numbers
adds another layer of deception.
Scammers can disguise the actual
number they are calling from so the
call looks like it is coming from a le-
gitimate number. You may recognize
the number calling you as a trust-
worthy local number, but the actual
call may be from a scam artist.
I remember an article from my home
State a couple of years ago that re-
ported that scammers had successfully
spoofed the number of the Watertown
Police Department. So to anyone who
received that call, it looked as if it was
really the Watertown Police Depart-
ment calling.
If the source looks credible and the
call sounds credible, it can be difficult
not to believe it, which is why people
fall prey to robocall scam artists every
single day, sometimes with devastating
consequences.
Scammers’ goal is to steal the kind
of personal information that can be
used to steal your money and your
identity. When scammers are success-
ful, they can destroy people’s lives.
There are laws and fines in place
right now to prevent scam artists from
preying on people through the tele-
phone, but unfortunately, these meas-
ures have been insufficient. Almost a
year ago today, when I was chairman
of the Commerce Committee, I subpoe-
naed Adrian Abramovich, a notorious
mass robocaller, to testify before the
committee. His testimony made it
clear that current fines are insufficient
to discourage robocallers. Robocallers
just figure that those fines are part of
the cost of doing business.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2299
April 9, 2019
In addition, the Federal Communica-
tions Commission’s anti-robocall en-
forcement efforts are currently ham-
pered by a tight time window for pur-
suing violations. To address these prob-
lems, at the end of last year I intro-
duced the Telephone Robocall Abuse
Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence
Act, or the TRACED Act.
Last week, my bipartisan legislation
passed the Commerce Committee by
unanimous vote. The TRACED Act pro-
vides tools to discourage illegal
robocalls, protect consumers, and
crack down on offenders. It expands the
window in which the FCC can pursue
intentional scammers from 1 year to 3
years, and in years 2 and 3, it increases
the financial penalty for those individ-
uals making robocalls from zero dol-
lars to $10,000 per call to make it more
difficult for robocallers to figure fines
into their cost of doing business.
It also requires telephone service pro-
viders to adopt new call verification
technologies that would help to pre-
vent illegal robocalls from reaching
consumers. Importantly, it convenes a
working group with representatives
from the Department of Justice, the
FCC, the Federal Trade Commission,
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau, State attorneys general, and oth-
ers to identify ways to criminally pros-
ecute illegal robocalling.
Criminal prosecution of illegal
robocalling can be challenging.
Scammers are frequently based abroad
and can quickly shut down shop before
authorities can get to them, but I be-
lieve we need to find ways to hold
scammers criminally accountable.
There are few things more despicable
than preying on and exploiting the vul-
nerable, and scammers should face
criminal prosecution for the damage
that they do.
I am very pleased that the TRACED
Act has now moved to the full Senate
for consideration. I am grateful to Sen-
ator MARKEY for partnering with me on
this legislation, and I am pleased that
this bipartisan bill has been embraced
by all 50 attorneys general, by the
Commissioners at the Federal Trade
Commission and the Federal Commu-
nications Commission, and by major
industry associations and leading con-
sumer groups.
Later this week, I will hold a hearing
on the Commerce Committee Sub-
committee on Communications, Tech-
nology, Innovation, and the Internet,
which I chair, to further examine the
problem of illegal robocalling. I will
work to get the TRACED Act to the
President’s desk as soon as possible.
This legislation will not prevent all
illegal robocalling, but it is a big step
in the right direction. I look forward to
helping consumers by enacting the
TRACED Act’s protections as soon as
possible.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
the watchword in the executive branch
today is ‘‘chaos.’’ This chaos stems
from one source and one source only—
President Donald Trump and his ex-
treme agenda—and America is paying
the price.
Everyone agrees there are issues at
the border, but if you are the President
and if you are in charge of our national
security, you don’t tweet your way
into a strategy; you don’t keep chang-
ing policies; and you don’t keep switch-
ing personnel if you want to make
progress on the most challenging issue
that is facing our country.
Every day, we hear this is the Presi-
dent’s new policy, and 2 days later, we
hear it is not happening. People are
being fired because they tell the Presi-
dent, according to news reports, that
he can’t break the law when he wants
to do something. You cannot keep
changing personnel, changing strategy,
and tweeting your way through a prob-
lem as serious as this. That is why
there is chaos when it comes to border
issues—all created by the President
and his whimsical, erratic, and often-
times nasty pursuit of policy.
Even the Republicans are worried
sick about the chaos President Trump
has created over the week. My friend
JOHN CORNYN says this is all a giant
‘‘mess’’—his words. Well, my friend
from Texas is correct. Yet this dys-
function is not confined to a few Agen-
cies; this chaos is throughout the exec-
utive branch because Donald Trump
has the same kind of switching of per-
sonnel, changing of policies, and trying
to tweet his way through a problem in
other areas as he does with regard to
the border.
Let me remind my colleagues that
the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, the Interior Secretary, and
the EPA Administrator each resigned
amid scandal. The Trump administra-
tion has not yet nominated anyone for
probably the most important Cabinet
position, the Secretary of Defense,
since Secretary Mattis’s departure, and
when he departed, Secretary Mattis
had a scathing rebuke of President
Trump’s policies.
Look at the chaos at the State De-
partment, where the damage extends
way beyond America’s borders. Because
of incompetence and inaction, there
are no nominees to more than 30 va-
cant key positions at State, including
Under Secretary of State for Public Di-
plomacy and Special Envoy for North
Korean Human Rights. There are no
nominees to be our Ambassador to
Pakistan or Egypt and none for Qatar
or Thailand.
This is not the Senate blocking
nominees as much as the President
likes to blame somebody else for his
problems; this is the President’s own
administration that has failed to nomi-
nate people for such important posi-
tions, and many of these positions have
been long vacant. The areas we men-
tioned are ever important in our
changing world, and this administra-
tion is simply failing to nominate any-
one.
We should be projecting stability and
continuity through our State Depart-
ment. Instead, it has been battered and
belittled by its own administration to
the point at which both sides in Con-
gress have spoken out. Just yesterday,
we learned the administration is push-
ing out the head of the Secret Service
amid a new scandal surrounding a secu-
rity breach at Mar-a-Lago, the so-
called winter White House. Now joining
the others who are gone—fired by Twit-
ter or whatever—is the head of the Se-
cret Service. All of this chaos has one
source and one source only—the Presi-
dent of the United States and his er-
ratic, vacillating attitudes toward pol-
icy and personnel.
Across a broad spectrum of issues,
his policies are so extreme that even
good-faith nominees eventually face a
choice—leave the administration or be
consumed by the quicksand of the
Trump swamp.
I hope the President or some of the
people around him will realize that his
administration is far from a fine-tuned
machine; it is a slow-motion disaster
that the American people see in action
every day.
WOMEN’S HEALTH
Madam President, on women’s
health, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee will hold a hearing today on a
sham bill that would further restrict
women’s access to care.
Every woman and every family in
America should shudder at the Repub-
licans’ campaign to take away the
rights of women to make decisions
about their own health just to satisfy a
hard-right, radical agenda that the
vast majority of Americans completely
disagrees with.
This bill would unduly restrict wom-
en’s rights to make their own health
decisions. Dr. Jennifer Conti, who is a
clinical assistant professor of OB/GYN
at Stanford, described the 20-week
mark set by the bill as ‘‘just an arbi-
trary limit set in place by politicians
that has no medical or scientific back-
ing.’’ Let me repeat—‘‘an arbitrary
limit set in place by politicians’’—poli-
ticians making decisions about wom-
en’s health. That is what is wrong here.
What is more, a 20-week ban is, argu-
ably, unconstitutional. Just 2 weeks
ago, a Federal judge in North Carolina
ruled it was. We know the 20-week ban
is just a start among those who want
to take away women’s rights. They will
try to go for a 10-week ban, then a 6-
week ban. It is all part of a radical, re-
lentless effort to completely and un-
equivocally strip women of their right

to make their own healthcare deci-
sions.
The rhetoric we will hear from the
Republicans in this hearing will be
much the same we have heard for
years. Whether it is a vote we took in
the Senate or a new law protecting
one’s rights in my home State of New
York, the Republicans have repeatedly
used scare tactics and falsehoods to
mislead the public. Yes, these are noth-
ing but scare tactics, but don’t take
my word for it. Time and time again,
fact checkers have ruled the Repub-
licans’ rhetoric on these issues to be
outright false.
Let’s be clear. Across the country,
the reproductive rights of women are
under attack. In statehouses across the
country, the Republicans are forcing
through radical proposals that would
dramatically limit women’s rights to
make their own choices—in Mis-
sissippi, in Georgia, in Kentucky. This
is a threat to women in all 50 States,
not just in those 3. It is dangerously
out of step with the American people.
The Trump administration is even
imposing a gag rule on healthcare pro-
viders to stop them from discussing the
full range of options with women who
consider having abortions. They are
literally preventing doctors from doing
their jobs. It is illogical, intrusive, and
hypocritical that the Republicans in
Washington would tell a doctor what
he or she can or cannot say to a patient
in a private medical conversation.
I have been around here long enough
to remember when the Republicans
were preaching that government
should never come between a patient
and his or her doctor. Why the change?
Since taking office, President Trump
and his Republican colleagues have re-
peatedly prioritized restricting wom-
en’s reproductive freedoms and have
strategically placed obstacles in the
way of their accessing the healthcare
they deserve. Donald Trump and our
Republican friends believe they know
better than American women. That is
wrong, and American women totally
disagree with them.
Yet, while the Republicans across the
country push these proposals, they
look the other way when President
Trump proposes cutting programs that
help newborns and young children.
The President wants to cut Medicaid
by more than $1 trillion. That provides
healthcare coverage for 37 million chil-
dren. He wants to eliminate programs
that support emergency medical health
services for children and that address
autism and developmental disorders.
I hope my Republican colleagues will
join us instead of slipping down this
radical, ideological, and deeply mis-
guided path to strip away the rights of
women.
H.R. 268
Now on disaster relief, as I said yes-
terday, the question of providing fund-
ing for our fellow Americans hurt by
natural disasters is not an either-or
proposition, but Republicans have
treated it like one. They argue that we
can either have funding for our neigh-
bors in the Midwest, or we can pursue
aid for Puerto Rico that the President
opposes. For the President of the
United States to pit American citizens
against each other is simply un-Amer-
ican, and for Republicans in the Senate
to go along with him is exhibit A of
their refusal to stand up.
Some of my colleagues have said:
Well, we are giving Puerto Rico just
food stamp money. OK. Let’s give all
the other States just food stamp
money. See if they think that is going
to help them rebuild their homes and
deal with the roads and all the other
things that natural disasters have
brought. Of course not.
That is the double standard, and it is
not going to happen. We know the
House, to their credit, is standing firm.
Let’s come up with a compromise
that funds both. As Americans have al-
ways done when American citizens in
one part of the country are in trouble
because of disaster, we come together
and help them all—not just the ones
the President likes or finds politically
advantageous but all. We don’t say: We
will give just food stamps to some but
complete disaster relief to the others.
That is wrong, and that hurts Amer-
ican citizens in Puerto Rico and else-
where.
Last week, Senator LEAHY and I pre-
sented a solution that solves all the
problems—$16.7 billion in relief for all
Americans affected by natural disas-
ters, including $2.5 billion in new fund-
ing that could help communities with
the new disasters in the Midwest. It
had support for Puerto Rico and the
people in the other territories.
It is about time we stop this standoff,
pass disaster relief, and help our fellow
Americans before the next storms
make their unwelcome arrival.
NOMINATIONS
Finally, on judges, today, the Repub-
lican leader will follow through on his
plan to remake the judiciary in the
image of President Trump. Irony of iro-
nies, the first nominee we will consider
is a gentleman who supported the Re-
publican leader’s decision to not con-
sider even a committee hearing or a
vote on Merrick Garland. That is gall-
ing.
Mr. Domenico and the other nomi-
nees we will consider today are outside
the mainstream—way outside the
mainstream—and should not be rushed
through this body. Two hours of debate
on a lifetime appointment? Shame on
our Republican friends who went along
with that.
By participating in this sham proc-
ess, every Republican will fully own
each and every radical decision each of
these nominees makes. We see what is
happening now. A very conservative
justice in Texas is taking healthcare
away from millions of Americans. He is
taking away their protection for pre-
existing conditions.
My fellow Republicans, you are on
warning: If you keep voting for these
judges, you are going to carry the bur-
den of their awful decisions that will
hurt so many Americans. They are so
far out of the mainstream.

WOMEN’S HEALTH
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as the
minority leader explained, we unfortu-
nately expect that today Senate Re-
publicans will again make an effort to
spread lies and misinformation about
why some women decide to have abor-
tions later in pregnancy, and they will
do so instead of listening to women
like Judy, from my home State of
Washington, who learned that her son’s
organs were not developing properly—
one lung was just 20 percent formed,
and the other was missing entirely;
women like Darla, from Texas, who
learned that the complications one of
her twins was facing could endanger
the other’s life as well; women like
Alyson, a mother of six, who learned
that one of her twins had died in the
womb and the other was facing severe
complications and that her own health
was in severe risk from the pregnancy;
or countless patients in States that
have so severely undermined access to
safe, legal abortion that women strug-
gle to exercise their rights protected
under our Constitution.
It is worth asking, with so much else
going on, why are Republicans spend-
ing time doubling down on lies to un-
dermine women’s reproductive health?
The unfortunate truth is that my Re-
publican colleagues are not repeating
these falsehoods because they are con-
cerned about children or families; in-
stead, they are doing whatever they
think will help them reach their goal
of taking away access to safe abortion
in the United States of America.
Republicans may not be listening to
women or doctors or families like the
ones I just mentioned who had to make
extremely difficult decisions, but
Democrats are listening. We know
women need to be able to make the
healthcare choices that are right for
them and their families, and
healthcare providers need to be able to
let medical standards, not politics,
drive patients’ care.
None of this should be controversial,
and for the vast majority of people
across the country, it is not. But as
long as Republicans are holding par-
tisan hearings to spread misinforma-
tion and lies or pushing anti-doctor,
anti-women, and anti-family legisla-
tion or putting up new barriers to
make it harder for women to access re-
productive healthcare or trying to
defund trusted healthcare providers
like Planned Parenthood through
harmful gag rules or jamming through
far-right, ideological judges to chip

NOMINATION OF DANIEL DESMOND DOMENICO
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I
come to the floor to speak in support of
Dan Domenico, the district judge we
will be voting on shortly.
I strongly support Dan Domenico for
the district court position in the Dis-
trict of Colorado. Dan has impeccable
academic and legal credentials. A na-
tive Coloradan, he is well known and
well respected throughout the entire
Colorado legal community. These char-
acteristics make him very well suited
to be on the bench.
A native of Boulder, CO, Dan received
his undergraduate degree from George-
town University and his juris doctorate
from the University of Virginia—it has
been a good week for the University of
Virginia: a new Federal judge and a na-
tional championship—where he grad-
uated order of the coif and was the edi-
tor of the law review.
After law school, Dan joined the re-
spected firm of Hogan & Hartson and
then clerked for Judge Tim
Tymkovich, who is now the chief judge
on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Following his clerkship, Dan contin-
ued his public service as a Special As-
sistant to the Solicitor in the U.S. De-
partment of the Interior. There, he ad-
vised the Secretary and the Depart-
ment on matters related to national
parks, fish and wildlife, Bureau of Land
Management issues, and Indian affairs.
These are all areas that matter a great
deal to Colorado and the West.
Dan was then appointed to be the so-
licitor general for the State of Colo-
rado. While he was the youngest person
tapped for the position, he then became
the longest serving solicitor general in
our State’s history, holding the posi-
tion for 9 years. As solicitor general,
Dan represented the State in both
State and Federal courts, including the
U.S. Supreme Court. He oversaw all
major litigation for the State, and he
provided legal advice to the Governor
and State agencies.
Dan is currently the founding and
managing partner at the Kittredge
LLC, where he represents clients in
high-stakes, complex litigation and ap-
peals. He is an adjunct professor at the
University of Denver’s College of Law,
where he teaches courses in natural re-
sources law and constitutional law.
As impressive as this background is,
it is also an insight into the type of
judge Dan would be. I am particularly
struck by Dan’s service as the Colorado
solicitor general.
While the Democratic leader may ob-
ject to Dan Domenico, two Democratic
Governors in Colorado did not. In fact,
they kept his service. In fact, Dan
served as solicitor general for the State
of Colorado during one Republican
Governor and two Democratic Gov-
ernors. He served, regardless of party,
with competence and zeal. That is what
the Colorado legal community would
tell anyone who wishes to listen. His
approach to the legal issues he con-
fronted was the same regardless of the
party in power. He looked to the law.
And that is what we expect in every
judge. That is what Colorado wants.
That is what our country needs. We
need experienced practitioners who are
respected by their peers and who will
faithfully apply the law regardless of
politics or place in life. That is what I
believe Dan will do, and that is why I
enthusiastically support his nomina-
tion and hope my colleagues will follow
suit as well.
I yield the floor.

SUPPORTING VETERANS
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was
fortunate to grow up in a military fam-
ily. My dad served for 31 years in the
U.S. Air Force. He actually started out
at a very young age as a B–17 pilot in
the Army Air Corps before the Air
Force was even created.
He was stationed at Molesworth Air
Force Base in England and flew mis-
sions across the English Channel into
Germany during World War II. He flew
26 of those missions, and he was suc-
cessful in completing each one of them
except for the last one. On the 26th
mission, he was shot down and cap-
tured as a POW for the last 4 months of
the war.
Growing up in a military family obvi-
ously means a lot to me. I grew up with
a father who demonstrated every day
what it means to be a patriot. Of
course, like most military brats—that
is what we called ourselves—I spent a
lot of time traveling around the coun-
try. Of course, I was born in Texas and
consider San Antonio home, but we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2302 April 9, 2019
lived in Mississippi and in Kensington,
MD, right outside the District of Co-
lumbia. I graduated from high school
in Japan. This is pretty typical of a lot
of military families because they tend
to move around quite a bit. One of the
biggest challenges, being a student
growing up in a military family, is fre-
quently having to change schools. That
requires a little bit of resilience on the
part of the student because they have
to learn how to make friends, even in
new settings.
Despite the challenges of moving
around as a kid, there was one thing I
was always grateful for. I had the privi-
lege of witnessing not only my dad but
so many others of our U.S. military
servicemembers in action. Seeing their
courage and sacrifice showed me early
on that there is nothing we can do to
adequately repay these men and
women for their service to their coun-
try, but you better believe we have to
try, and we are going to keep trying—
not just to repay them but to recognize
them and to honor them.
In Congress we accomplished a lot for
our military over the last few years.
We restored America’s defense with the
greatest investment in the military in
decades, including the largest troop
pay raise in nearly 10 years. That is
after we tried unsuccessfully to do
what we have done from time to time,
which is to cash in the ‘‘peace divi-
dend.’’ Unfortunately, we can’t cash in
the peace dividend because there never
seems to be peace, as much as we would
hope and pray for that.
But supporting our heroes on the bat-
tlefield is only part of our responsi-
bility toward the military. We are also
focused on ensuring that they get the
care, support, and opportunities they
need once they come home and take
the uniform off as a veteran.
I have heard from many of my vet-
erans in Texas who are frustrated with
the services provided by VA facilities.
They shared stories about having to
travel hours upon hours to receive
care, sometimes forcing them to accept
lower quality care or sometimes to
forego it entirely.
Both in Texas and across the coun-
try, VA facilities have notably been
plagued by inefficiency, lack of ac-
countability, and quality of care
issues. Making matters more chal-
lenging, the VA has been hindered by
unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. The
Veterans’ Administration has more
than 300,000 people working for them.
So bureaucracy should be its middle
name. It is not designed to be efficient,
but it is incredibly frustrating and
costly for our veterans as they seek to
get the care we promised them and
that we are dutybound to provide.
Sadly, in some cases veterans turn to
alternative coping mechanisms that
can lead to destructive addictions. We
know that self-medication is a real
problem, particularly for mental
health issues, and veterans, unless they
are diagnosed properly and receive the
correct medical care, can spiral down
as a result of an alcohol or drug addic-
tion, which is a coping or self-medica-
tion mechanism that does not work out
well. Those stories do not end well at
all. Those are some of the challenges
we have facing our veterans and trying
to provide them with the services they
are entitled to and have earned.
But there is a good news part to this
story. Last summer we took a major
step to provide veterans with the
healthcare they deserve when we
passed the VA MISSION Act. This leg-
islation will make significant reforms
in the Department of Veterans Affairs
and provide veterans with more flexi-
bility to make decisions themselves re-
garding their healthcare. In other
words, they don’t have to adapt to the
system. The system can adapt to them
and be flexible to their needs.
One of the most common frustrations
I hear from my Texas veterans is that
it is sometimes impractical to travel
to the next VA hospital when they need
care. This legislation, the VA MISSION
Act, consolidates and improves VA
community programs. In other words,
you can get the care in your commu-
nity. It allows veterans to receive care
from private hospitals and doctors.
It also provides funding for the Vet-
erans Choice Program to continue
until the approved Veterans Commu-
nity Care Program matures and is fully
in effect.
The VA MISSION Act included some
of the most substantial reforms to the
veterans healthcare system in years,
lowering the barriers to care for vet-
erans and giving them more treatment
options. It has also provided the larg-
est funding increase in recent history
for veterans’ care and services and
modernized the VA’s electronic health
record system.
My hope is it will provide some need-
ed relief to veterans and their families
who aren’t happy with the status quo,
and we will continue to work with
them until we get this right, to build
on these reforms until we are able to
provide the sort of care all of our vet-
erans need and deserve. We don’t want
to just provide for these men and wom-
en’s physical needs, we also need to en-
sure that they have adequate mental
health resources as well.
Last Congress, I was an original co-
sponsor of the Veteran Urgent Access
to Mental Healthcare Act. Enacted as
part of the 2018 Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, this law now allows
those discharged under certain other-
than-honorable conditions access to
critical mental health care facilities.
Veterans who are struggling deserve to
be carefully evaluated at the onset of
their mental illness and supported with
the VA medical treatment necessary
for their recovery.
I was proud to introduce the Mental
Health and Safe Communities Act,
which established peer-to-peer services
that connect qualified veterans with
other veterans to provide support and
mentorship. One of the things I hear
from our servicemembers, when they
take the uniform off, is that what they
miss most about the military is the ca-
maraderie and sense of teamwork and
mutual support. This legislation is de-
signed to try to provide some transi-
tional support for peer-to-peer services,
to connect qualified veterans with
other veterans during that period of
time. It will also allow qualified vet-
erans to obtain treatment, recovery,
stabilization, and rehabilitation serv-
ices.
While providing physical and mental
healthcare for veterans is a top pri-
ority, it is only part of providing a
smooth transition for those who leave
military life to return to civilian life.
We want to ensure that they have
ample employment opportunities as
well.
Last month, the veterans unemploy-
ment rate was 2.9 percent—down from
4.1 percent in March of last year and
lower than the national unemployment
rate. I would like to think that is, in
part, a result of the concerted effort we
have made to provide more opportunity
to our veterans to transition into a
meaningful career after life in the mili-
tary. I am encouraged by those positive
numbers. We will continue to follow
them and make sure it is not just a
blip on the radar screen.
Last Congress, I introduced the
American Law Enforcement Heroes
Act, which is now law. It amended a
1968 law to allow grant funds to be used
to hire and train veterans as career law
enforcement officers. Everywhere I go
across the State of Texas, I talk to po-
lice departments that were really hav-
ing huge challenges trying to fill the
vacancies in their ranks. This will
allow more of our veterans who are
trained to serve as career law enforce-
ment officers and use grant funds to
hire and train them further to make
sure they have the skills needed in a
specific police department or law en-
forcement position. This bill makes
sure veterans can get hired by local
law enforcement agencies when they
come out of the military with the very
skills that are needed by those police
agencies working to keep our commu-
nities safe.
I also introduced the Jobs for Our He-
roes Act, which was signed into law
last January. This streamlines the
process by which Active-Duty military
reservists and veterans receive com-
mercial driver’s licenses.
Finally, another bill I will mention
was the Harry W. Colmery Veterans
Educational Assistance Act, which
made much needed updates for vet-
erans facing school closures while en-
rolled. It also increased the resources
and opportunities for educational as-
sistance for veterans pursuing STEM
careers—science, technology, engineer-
ing, and math—something we need
more of.
Every piece of legislation I men-
tioned was signed into law by Presi-
dent Trump and represents our com-
mitment in the Senate to supporting
America’s veterans. I am proud of the

work we have been able to do together
on a bipartisan basis—big and small—
to provide America’s veterans with the
support and resources they need as
they transition to civilian life.
There is more I would like to accom-
plish this Congress to provide greater
care and open more doors to veterans.
I look forward to working with all of
my colleagues to do exactly that.
TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL PAUL E.
FUNK II
Madam President, finally, I want to
take just a moment to congratulate
one outstanding servicemember from
Texas who just received a big pro-
motion. The Senate recently confirmed
LTG Paul E. Funk II for his fourth star
and for the position of commanding
general of the U.S. Army Training and
Doctrine Command.
Since 2017, General Funk has served
as commanding general of the Third
Armored Corps at Ford Hood, where he
commands about 100,000 soldiers on five
installations across five States. As ex-
cited as we were for him to take the
helm at Fort Hood, it felt more like a
homecoming for General Funk.
As a matter of fact, he was born at
Fort Hood and is the son of a previous
commander of the Third Corps at Fort
Hood. They were the first father-son
duo to command the unit and joined a
small but impressive group of other fa-
thers and sons who have commanded
the same corps.
Throughout his career, General Funk
has been deployed five times and led
soldiers during Operations Desert
Shield, Desert Storm, twice in Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Endur-
ing Freedom, and Operation Inherent
Resolve. General Funk is highly deco-
rated and has received multiple Distin-
guished Service Medals, the Defense
Superior Service Medal, multiple Le-
gion of Merit awards, and numerous
Bronze Stars, among other medals.
I wanted to say a few words to con-
gratulate soon-to-be General Funk and
his wife, Dr. Beth Funk, on this incred-
ible accomplishment. He is an out-
standing soldier, leader, and patriot,
and will do great work at TRADOC.
The State of Texas is sad to say fare-
well, but we wish him the very best as
he heads to Virginia for this incredible
opportunity and his continued service
to our country.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Lou-
isiana.
STOP SILENCING VICTIMS ACT
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I
want to talk briefly about two sub-
jects. The first is sexual harassment.
More specifically, I want to talk about
a bill I am going to be introducing. It
is about the abuse of nondisclosure
agreements across government.
There are victims of sexual harass-
ment who are prohibited from talking
about their experiences because of a
nondisclosure agreement that is at-
tached to a settlement and has been
paid for by taxpayers or, in some cases,
with private funds. Victims are si-
lenced. Victims are silenced so voters
can’t find out about this disgusting be-
havior.
I have always believed that sunlight
is the best antiseptic and the best dis-
infectant, and it is long past time, in
my opinion, that we stop revictimizing
people who wanted nothing more than
to come to work every day and be
treated with basic human dignity.
The title of my proposed law is the
Stop Silencing Victims Act. It is really
very simple. It would say that if you
are a State or Federal employee or if
you are a public official or a public em-
ployee and you are accused of sexual
harassment and you settle that law-
suit—whether you settle it with tax-
payer funds or private funds—then a
nondisclosure agreement is prohibited
in that settlement unless the victim
wants to have a nondisclosure agree-
ment. In other words, if you are ac-
cused of sexual harassment and you
settle the case, the taxpayers are enti-
tled to know about the settlement un-
less the victim decides otherwise.
I am going to be careful here. We be-
lieve passionately, as we should, in due
process in America; that just because
you are accused of something doesn’t
mean you are guilty of it. Some of my
colleagues have suggested in the past
that you are morally tainted if you
don’t automatically believe all accus-
ers. I don’t agree with that. I think you
are morally tainted if you don’t treat
both the accuser and accused with re-
spect and dignity and due process. So
the purpose of my bill is not to take
away anybody’s due process. Just be-
cause you are accused of something
doesn’t mean you are guilty of it.
Having said that, I think we have to
face the facts in America. We have had
far too many instances of sexual har-
assment. We have seen it in Hollywood
repeatedly. I don’t know how the ac-
tors in Hollywood have time to make
movies; they are too busy molesting
each other.
It is not just in Hollywood. It is all
across society. It is in the Halls of Con-
gress. It is in the halls of State govern-
ment. It is in the boardroom. It is all
across America. For the first time in a
long time, women who are usually—not
always but usually—the victims of sex-
ual harassment have started to speak
up. I thank them for that.
My bill will further enhance their
voice. If they make an accusation of
sexual harassment and the alleged per-
petrator is a State employee or Federal
employee and the lawsuit is settled, no
longer will you be able to have an
agreement that says nobody can talk
about it unless the victim wants to.
Once again, I think this kind of trans-
parency will help us fight a very seri-
ous problem in America because this is
no country for creepy old men or for
creepy young men or for creepy mid-
dle-aged men or for anybody—man or
woman—who would use his or her
power to obtain sexual favors from
somebody in fear of them in power in
the workplace or otherwise.
IMMIGRATION
Madam President, I believe any
President is entitled to surround him-
self with the advisers of his choice. I
firmly believe that.
As you know, our recent Secretary of
Homeland Security has been replaced.
She and the President met on Sunday,
and they mutually decided there would
be a change at the top in Homeland Se-
curity. Secretary Nielsen decided to re-
sign.
Shortly thereafter, her White House
colleagues, her friends—the people she
has worked with day in and day out to
try to solve this crisis of illegal immi-
gration into America—immediately be-
came anonymous sources and pro-
ceeded to cut her to pieces off the
record. Of course, our press, as it is en-
titled to do under the First Amend-
ment, feasted on it. These were Sec-
retary Nielsen’s colleagues; the people
she worked with on a daily basis.
This is America. Within reason, you
can say what you want, but you ought
to put your name to it. You shouldn’t
hide behind the label of an anonymous
source. I believe, and I suspect the Pre-
siding Officer does, too, that we should
treat people with dignity and respect. I
felt and still feel Secretary Nielsen’s
former colleagues did not show her dig-
nity and respect. In fact, their behavior
was classless.
I think Secretary Nielsen did the
very best she could under difficult cir-
cumstances, for we do have a problem
at the border. ‘‘Problem’’ is an under-
statement. In March, we had 100,000
people come into our country illegally.
That is the most in 10 years. If that
continues, we are going to set a record
this year of the number of people en-
tering our country illegally.
We are a nation of immigrants, and I
am proud of that. Americans cannot be
called anti-immigrant. Every year, we
welcome a million people across the
world to come into our country and be-
come Americans. They do it legally.
They follow the law—they are properly
vetted; they get in line; they wait pa-
tiently. Then we welcome them in. We
are a nation of immigrants, and I am
very proud of that.
Unfortunately, we have another
500,000 to 600,000 people who don’t fol-
low the rules. They come into our
country illegally. Illegal immigration
is illegal. Even if you think it is a good
idea—and I don’t—if you care about the
rule of law, which is one of the bedrock
principles in America, then you would
want to stop illegal immigration. It is
just that simple.
I don’t care who the President puts in
charge of Homeland Security. I don’t
want to leave that statement in isola-
tion or allow it to be taken out of con-
text. Obviously, the Secretary of the
Department of Homeland Security is a
very important post, but I don’t care
which man or woman the President
chooses, for we are not going to solve
this problem until we do three things.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2304 April 9, 2019
us here. We have to solve this problem
ourselves.
The first thing we have to do is to
build a wall. I am not talking about a
wall from sea to shining sea. We have
1,900 miles of border. I am talking
about barriers that are strategically
placed. You cannot seal a 1,900-mile
piece of real estate without having a
barrier. It can’t be done. If you don’t
believe me, ask Israel. That is why it
has a 400-plus-mile border wall with the
West Bank. That is why Saudi Arabia
has a border wall with Yemen. That is
why India has a border wall as do Bul-
garia and Malaysia. I could keep going.
Border walls work. All border walls say
is: If you come into our country, come
in legally because we believe in the
rule of law.
The second thing we need to do, as
the Presiding Officer well knows, is to
pass asylum laws that look like some-
body designed the things on purpose
because what we have now doesn’t fit
that description. If you are coming
from Central America—from El Sal-
vador, from Nicaragua, from Guate-
mala—all you have to do is make it to
American soil, say the magic words,
and you will be allowed into our coun-
try. You will be told: We are going to
give you a court date. Yet we are so far
behind in our immigration court that
the court date will likely come in a
year and a half or 2 years. You will be
released into the country, and you will
be told to come back for the court
date. Some do. Many don’t.
No other country that I am aware of
has an asylum law as upside down as
ours. You could drive all across Wash-
ington, DC, and pick the first person
you find who is living under the inter-
state and say: You draft an asylum law
for us. It would be better than the asy-
lum law we have right now.
The U.S. Senate ought to be debating
America’s asylum laws right this sec-
ond. I am not saying the other things
we are doing—we are in the personnel
business—aren’t important, but there
is not a single issue right now that is
more important. Congress needs to do
its job, and the Senate ought to be de-
bating this issue right now. I don’t
know how it will turn out. How about
we just surprise ourselves for a change
and do something intelligent by put-
ting the issue on the floor of the Sen-
ate and by letting us debate it and
offer amendments. We might be sur-
prised at what we can achieve.
The third thing we are going to have
to do to solve our problem is to con-
vince our friends in Mexico and our
friends in Central America—El Sal-
vador, Guatemala, Nicaragua—to work
with us in terms of solving this prob-
lem. What I would like to see the Presi-
dent do is to call an immigration sum-
mit. He has declined to do it, but I am
going to keep talking about it until I
persuade him to call an immigration
summit. Invite the President of Mexico
and the President of the Northern Tri-
angle Central American countries.
Let’s come together, and let’s talk
about the problem.
There are some bad people coming
across the border. Some of them are
from Central America. The President is
right about that. We have gang mem-
bers, drug dealers, criminals, child sex
traffickers, and adult sex traffickers.
Yet all of the people coming across are
not bad people. They are coming be-
cause they are scared. I read an anal-
ysis the other day of a poll conducted
by Vanderbilt University. It was the
most expensive, thorough poll that one
could do. They didn’t call people on the
telephones; they talked to people in
person. It was a representative sample.
This poll found that between one-
third and one-half of the people with
whom they talked who lived in Central
American countries—the so-called
Northern Triangle countries—had been
victims of crime within the past year,
usually of extortion. That is the prob-
lem in these Central American coun-
tries—the gangs are running the coun-
tries. In many cases, the police and
elected leadership are complicit. I
mean, imagine how bad things would
have to be for you to take your child
and your spouse and decide ‘‘I am going
to leave where I am and walk, with the
clothes on my back, 500 to 1,000 miles
to another country because that is how
bad things are where I am right now.’’
That is the case with many of the peo-
ple in Central America.
I don’t know the answer. I think we
should start with a Presidential sum-
mit—not representatives of the Presi-
dent’s but a Presidential summit of the
President of the United States, Presi-
dent of Mexico Lopez Obrador, and the
Presidents of the Northern Triangle
countries. Let’s see what we can do to
try to solve this problem.
There is precedent for this. Back in
the late 1990s and well into the next
decade, we had a terrible problem with
drug cartels and cocaine coming into
this country from Colombia. We didn’t
solve that problem overnight. We
solved it by working with Colombia to
develop what we called then Plan Co-
lombia. We sat down with the Presi-
dent of Colombia and said: We will
work with you. We will even provide
some of the funding in return for spe-
cific commitments—one being to stop
growing cocoa leaves, for example. It
has taken a decade, but we have not
completely solved the problem. Yet, if
you visit Colombia today, it is a dif-
ferent country.
Let me say again—and I will end on
this note—that I am not anti-immigra-
tion, and I don’t think most Americans
are. We are a nation of immigrants, but
illegal immigration undermines legal
immigration. Some of my colleagues
don’t agree with that. They don’t make
the distinction between legal and ille-
gal immigration. Some of my col-
leagues, I am convinced—and it is their
right, for this is America; believe what
you want—believe that illegal immi-
gration is a moral good. I don’t. I think
illegal immigration is illegal, and I
think it hurts our country. We are not
going to solve this problem until we
control the flow of people from Central
America, until we revise our asylum
laws, and until we build a barrier.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I
rise to discuss a new and growing fun-
damentalism—a fundamentalism of in-
tolerance and bigotry that is spreading
on our college campuses, in our univer-
sity systems, and in the media. It is a
fundamentalism that wraps itself in
the language of tolerance but that is,
in fact, a cloak for discrimination
against people of faith. This new fun-
damentalism would undermine the
most important constitutional guaran-
tees and traditions of our Nation that
have allowed us to live in civil peace
and civil friendship for over 200 years,
and that is the subject of my remarks
this afternoon.
The latest example of this new fun-
damentalism of intolerance comes
from Yale University—in particular,
from Yale Law School—where we
learned last week that Yale Law
School had imposed a new policy that
would block students who work for cer-
tain faith-based organizations from ac-
cessing resources that are available to
all other students. Specifically, that
policy would prohibit students from re-
ceiving school resources if they decided
to work for an organization that takes
religious faith into account when hir-
ing. Unlike Federal law, Yale’s policy,
as announced, failed to include an ex-
emption for religious organizations
even though Federal law recognizes the
rights of religious organizations to hire
based on their faiths.
What we are talking about here is
something very simple. Yale said to a
group of students that if those in the
group wanted to work for faith-based
organizations, they would not be able
to access the same funds or the same
loan repayment programs that are of-
fered to all other students who work
for all other organizations. As to what
Yale held out to students as being a
neutral and generally available pro-
gram for folks who chose to work in
the public’s interest either during the
summer or after law school, Yale Law
School, last week, said: Oh, no. It is
not going to be available if you are a
student of faith and choose to go to
work for an organization that is faith-
based and want to pursue its faith-
based mission.
Ironically, this was done in the name
of tolerance. Yale said it was trying to

foster a more tolerant environment. In
fact, this is the most rank intolerance.
It is flatout discrimination. It is dis-
crimination against religious organiza-
tions and nonprofit organizations that
are pursuing their good work and that
are, in many instances, doing so with-
out asking their clients to pay a single
cent. It is discrimination on the basis
of faith, pure and simple. It is discrimi-
nation against students of faith who
want to go to public interest organiza-
tions that share their faith missions
and who want to do good in the world
by pursuing those beliefs while helping
those who are in need. It is discrimina-
tion, at the end of the day and at the
root of the matter, that rejects this
country’s commitment and our First
Amendment’s commitment to plu-
ralism.
You know, our First Amendment is
an extraordinary text. When enacted,
it was the first of its kind in the world,
and it makes an extraordinary commit-
ment. It says that the people of this
country have the right to pursue and to
observe their religious beliefs, what-
ever they may be, so long as they do so
in peace with one another. It is, as an
old friend of mine once said, the right
to be wrong. The First Amendment
guarantees that every single American
can pursue his or her most fundamen-
tally held, deeply held religious beliefs
so long as they don’t harm other peo-
ple. That doesn’t mean we all have to
agree on what our religious beliefs are.
It doesn’t mean we have to agree on
the outcomes our religious creeds lead
us to.
Our First Amendment recognizes the
right to be wrong, but this new fun-
damentalism, this new intolerance and
bigotry does not recognize the right to
be wrong. In fact, it wants to eliminate
the right to be wrong. It wants to say
that, no, we all have to agree. We all
have to now share Yale’s view of what
an appropriate religious mission is. We
now have to share Yale’s view of what
students should be doing with their
time. We have to share Yale’s view of
what our deeply held beliefs, religious
or otherwise, should be.
This sort of fundamentalism insists
on a monochromatic view of the world
that we all believe the same thing, that
we all act in the same way, that we all
behave the way our elites want us to
behave. Well, I submit to you that is
not the First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. That is not our great tra-
dition of pluralism. That is not what
has allowed us to live in civil peace and
civil friendship for these many years.
The question is, Why do Yale Law
School and other institutions pursue
policies like this? Well, it is not be-
cause of the law. Let’s be clear about
that. In fact, Federal law and, indeed,
our Constitution prohibit precisely this
kind of targeting of people of faith for
disfavor. Just in 2017, the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled in a case called Trinity Lu-
theran that policies that target the re-
ligious for special disabilities based on
their religious status are unconstitu-
tional. Indeed, as I said earlier, Federal
law explicitly prohibits the targeting
of individuals for their religious faith.
No, Yale Law School is not enacting
this policy because the law requires it;
they are enacting this policy because
they no longer believe in the right to
be wrong. They no longer believe that
our religious faith is so fundamental, is
so significant, and is so meaningful
that we ought to be allowed to pursue
it peacefully, in harmony with one an-
other.
You know, Yale said of their policy
that ‘‘the law school cannot prohibit a
student from working for an employer
who discriminates’’—that is their un-
derstanding of what religious organiza-
tions do when they ask that the mem-
bers of the organization share the same
faith; they call that discrimination—
‘‘the law school cannot prohibit a stu-
dent from working for an employer
who discriminates, but that is not a
reason why Yale Law School should
bear any obligation to fund that
work.’’
Well, Yale Law School can certainly
pursue its own beliefs, its own objec-
tives, and its own values, but why
should they be doing it with Federal
taxpayer money? That is my question.
Yale University receives millions of
dollars in Federal taxpayer subsidies
every year, which they use to pad their
multibillion-dollar endowment. Yale
Law School, this seat of privilege, does
not have to accept this money from the
Federal Government—I submit to you,
is not entitled to this money from the
Federal Government if they are going
to engage in patterns of discrimination
targeted at religious students and reli-
gious organizations for special dis-
favor.
So I propose this: If Yale Law School
and Yale University want to pursue a
policy of discrimination towards reli-
gious believers, they may certainly do
so, but they may not do it with Federal
taxpayer money.
You know, Yale said at the end of
last week that they would add an ex-
emption now. They said they would add
an exemption for religious organiza-
tions and religious believers. We
haven’t seen that exemption yet. I no-
tice that it took days of pressure and
outcry for them to come forward with
this. I hope they will add an exemp-
tion. I hope they will stop targeting re-
ligious students for special disfavor.
But what I hope above all is this: I
hope that Yale Law School and Yale
University will recommit themselves
to our proud tradition of pluralism, of
diversity, of the right to be wrong,
which has been the basis for our civic
friendship, for our civic peace, for the
extraordinary diversity of thought and
belief we so cherish in this country.

SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I rise
today to focus on a serious issue that
has plagued our society and impacted
the lives of so many people across our
great Nation: sexual assault.
During my time at Iowa State Uni-
versity, I served as a volunteer coun-
selor at a crisis center that provided
shelter and support to survivors of
abuse and sexual assault. I heard so
many gut-wrenching stories of women
and of men fleeing domestic abusers,
suffering not just physically but emo-
tionally and spiritually. Taking calls
on our hotline from people who had
been raped and sexually abused was ab-
solutely heartbreaking.
Abuse is not something you can just
simply forget; it stays with you for-
ever. And I know this personally. As a
survivor and as a Senator, I feel it is
important to be a voice for the thou-
sands of victims across Iowa and so
many more across our Nation who have
fallen prey to sexual assault, to rape,
to harassment, and other forms of
abuse. Our country is facing a mental
health crisis, and one cannot help but
feel that these issues are all too often
interwoven into the stories of so many
Americans.
April is Sexual Assault Awareness
Month. As lawmakers, it is a stark re-
minder that we must take a long, hard
look at how we combat this problem
and take real steps to confront sexual
assault in our society.
Just last week, with my colleagues
Senator GRASSLEY, Senator GILLI-
BRAND, and others, we reintroduced a
bipartisan bill to combat sexual as-
sault on our college and university
campuses. Our bipartisan measure will
make campuses in Iowa safer and en-
sure victims are fairly heard by chang-
ing the way our universities handle
sexual assault cases.
But it is not just these young men
and women at these institutions who
have been victimized. Like so many of
you, I was horrified—absolutely horri-
fied—to hear of the crimes committed
by Larry Nassar, the USA Gymnastics
doctor who abused hundreds of young
athletes. The actions of Nassar and the
individuals and institutions that facili-
tated and then protected his behavior
are inexcusable.
The cases were also symptomatic of
broader problems our society faces on
sexual assault, rape, harassment, and
abuse, leaving women and men, young
and old, vulnerable. These types of fail-
ures are the reasons I have worked
with my colleagues in Congress on re-
forms to ensure sexual misconduct is
reported, responded to, taken seri-
ously, and ideally prevented. For in-
stance, we introduced a bill to require
the governing bodies of U.S. amateur
athletic organizations to immediately
report sex abuse allegations to local or
Federal law enforcement or a child
welfare agency.
But the work doesn’t end with our
educational and athletic institutions;
we must challenge people to do better

to protect people from these horren-
dous actions. In the case of the mili-
tary, the Department of Defense should
take a stronger posture in terms of pre-
venting sexual assault within its
ranks. I say this as a former company
commander and a retired lieutenant
colonel. While there have been con-
crete steps taken to improve the safety
of our servicemembers, there is more
that we can and should do to protect
our men and women in uniform and
change the overall culture.
The message I hear all too often is
that victims in our armed services
have a fear of retaliation. Folks, this is
absolutely unacceptable. Those who re-
port sexual assault should not fear
coming forward, and those who retali-
ate against individuals should be pun-
ished to the full extent of the law. I
helped author a bill to make retalia-
tion its own unique offense under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice, and
fortunately for our servicemembers,
this bill is now law.
It is my hope that Congress can con-
tinue to work on legislation that ad-
dresses these issues.
While my personal story certainly
does play a role in my passion for
change, so also do the stories and faces
of men and women back home in Iowa,
every single one of them, with that
face, with that name, with that heart,
and with that soul. It is their stories
that push me to want to make real and
lasting change. Whether it is working
with Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN, rank-
ing member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, to reauthorize the Violence
Against Women Act or fighting to re-
duce the abuse of females in custody
through legislation with Senators
BOOKER and BLUMENTHAL, combating
sexual assault should be bipartisan and
something we all can agree on.
I look forward to continuing to work
with my colleagues toward ending sex-
ual assault once and for all. This issue
will continue to plague us until we
come together and take concrete steps
to address it. We all can and must do
better.
This month, as we raise awareness of
sexual assault, I hope to see this body
taking real and lasting action.
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2307
April 9, 2019
floor of the Senate today for the first
time. I really want to say a thank you
to my colleagues here in the Senate for
the warm welcome, especially Senator
ALEXANDER, for the friendship, advice,
and counsel he supplies to each and
every one of us, especially to me.
I am really humbled to be here as the
first female elected from Tennessee to
serve in the Senate. I just have to note
that a few decades ago, neither the
Presiding Officer, who is the first
woman from West Virginia, nor I could
have been here in this Chamber speak-
ing because women would not have
been allowed. Yet our suffragists took
care of that with women getting the
right to vote.
I love this quote by Susan B. An-
thony. I think it is so good and appro-
priate for us: ‘‘I declare to you that
woman must not depend upon the pro-
tection of man, but must be taught to
protect herself, and there I take my
stand.’’
Women have always been fierce de-
fenders of freedom and freedom’s cause.
Many times people will say to me: Why
do you choose to serve? For me, it real-
ly is more or less a calling to public
service. In that calling, I find it impor-
tant to defeat the narrative that still
exists to this day that conservative
women should be seen but not heard.
Here in this Chamber and in my role, I
will continue to fight against a media
that chooses to empower women on one
side of the political aisle and denigrate
those of us on the other side of the
aisle. I am going to make certain that
conservative women do have a strong
voice in the Senate.
I am here because, throughout my
history—my family’s history, as I have
researched our history—there were so
many who chose to serve in the mili-
tary. There are others, like my family,
who have chosen to serve our commu-
nities and our neighbors in our schools,
in our churches, and in community ac-
tivities. I regard my public service as a
civic duty and a way to give back to
the country that has given me so many
blessings.
What I have found from Tennesseans
is that many of them are just like me.
They have grown up in a rural area.
They have worked hard, and they have
built their version of the American
dream. I am very typical of that. I
grew up on a farm, attended college,
married, had children, two grand-
children, and really appreciate the op-
portunities I have been given to work
hard, to build a business, and to share
in the benefits of hard work.
Politically, I fought the establish-
ment of both parties in Tennessee when
I was in the State senate. There, thou-
sands of Tennesseans joined me in op-
posing a massive, job-killing State in-
come tax. We won that fight.
Ever since, I have been focused on
fighting high taxes and fighting waste-
ful spending because I know the money
we appropriate and that gets spent is
not Washington’s money; it is the tax-
payers’ hard-earned money. Govern-
ment ought not have the first right of
refusal on your paycheck, but it does.
It is part of our duty as public servants
to be responsible stewards of the tax-
payers’ money and to be aggressive in
rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.
I think we should heed the 2010 warn-
ing of the then-Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs, Admiral Mullen, when he said:
‘‘The most significant threat to our na-
tional security is our debt.’’
Our debt today is a staggering $22
trillion. Now, think about this. When
George Bush left office, that debt was
at $10.7 trillion. It is $22 trillion today.
For our children and for our grand-
children, I think it is immoral to pass
on this kind of debt.
I am also here because I am pro-life,
and I will protect those who cannot
protect themselves. I will tell you it is
astounding to me that this body could
not pass legislation that would protect
babies who are born alive as a result of
botched abortions. It is a disgrace. Big
Abortion must be held accountable be-
cause its actions are a stain on the
moral fabric of our country.
Just as I promised Tennesseans, I
promise my colleagues that I am going
to work hard and will stand strong for
what I believe in because I know I am
working for freedom, free people, and
free markets. As Frederick Douglass
said, ‘‘I would unite with anybody to do
right and with nobody to do wrong.’’ I
invite all of my colleagues to join me
in protecting what I term to be the
‘‘big five’’—faith, family, freedom,
hope, and opportunity, especially free-
dom.
Washington needs to be reminded of
just how precious the core value of
freedom is, not only for Tennesseans
but for all Americans. Every commu-
nity and every church in Tennessee is
filled with veterans and families who
have sacrificed and who cherish that
hard-won gift of freedom. They talk
about it regularly. They have parades.
When the troops come home, they cele-
brate our freedom. In Tennessee, we
have 470,000 veterans who call Ten-
nessee home, and it is such an honor to
come to this body and stand with them
because of the work they have done for
us.
I serve on the Armed Services and
Veterans’ Affairs Committees. We
know our military has to have the re-
sources it needs to fight our 21st cen-
tury adversaries. Our veterans deserve
not only our thanks but the benefits
that have been offered to them. So, last
month, I introduced the Gold Star
Family Fellowship Program Act. This
will establish a fellowship for those
Gold Star families in our Senate of-
fices. I have also joined Senator
TESTER in the Hello Girls Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act to honor our
women soldiers from World War I.
I am here to make certain our Nation
is a nation of legal immigrants, not of
illegal immigrants. The chaos at the
border should embarrass each and
every one of us as it has been decades
in the making. This crisis is something
we ought to work together on solving—
drug trafficking, sex trafficking,
human trafficking, and gangs. We must
solve it rather than allow it to be a po-
litical issue for a campaign.
I am here to work to protect your
right to privacy—the physical and the
virtual space. Yesterday Senator KLO-
BUCHAR and I sent a letter to the FTC
that focuses on how we protect Ameri-
cans from what I call the data pirates
at Google and Facebook. Your privacy
is important, and I believe you and I
have the right to send notes to our
friends without having the entire sto-
ries of our lives sold to the highest on-
line bidder.
We are finishing our work on the
BROWSER Act. I introduced this when
I was in the House, and we are going to
introduce it here because I believe it is
imperative to give you the tools to pro-
tect yourselves online. I believe we
need one set of privacy rules for the en-
tire internet ecosystem. This is what
you call fairness.
Our family has always believed we
have a responsibility to leave a place
in better shape than we found it. It is,
more or less, our family mantra.
I will say that changing the rules of
the Senate to allow for the confirma-
tions of judges and to proceed on the
Executive Calendar are exactly the
right moves. You can call it the nu-
clear option or whatever you want to
call it. In the press, I have heard it
called many things in the last few
days, but obstruction tactics do abso-
lutely nothing to leave this Chamber
or the country in better shape. Maybe
it makes for good political rhetoric,
but our country deserves better.
I agree with Leader MCCONNELL. This
is a key way to help our Nation and our
Chamber function fully and better. As
a member of the Judiciary Committee,
I am going to work to confirm those
qualified judges who will respect and
uphold the Constitution.
In January, it was an honor to be
sworn in by Justice Brett Kavanaugh
and to join Senator ERNST as being the
first Republican women on the Judici-
ary Committee. Being the first woman
ever elected to the Senate from Ten-
nessee and being a conservative woman
are things that are not lost on me. In-
deed, conservative women have quite a
track record in leading the fight for
freedom in our Nation’s history.
At the top of that record is fighting
and winning the right for women to
vote. Next year, we are going to cele-
brate the 100th anniversary of the rati-
fication of the 19th Amendment, grant-
ing women the right to vote. You may
not be aware, but Tennessee was the
36th and the decisive State to ratify
this amendment. It was the suffragists
who fought and led that charge, and I
am honored to join so many of our fe-
male colleagues in this Chamber in
drafting legislation to honor that anni-
versary. Indeed, I am going to provide
all of our colleagues the opportunity to
cosponsor and participate in one of
those bills that will have a commemo-
rative coin for the event.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2308 April 9, 2019
Howard Baker—a great Tennessean
and the former majority leader of this
body—once remarked about the nature
of the Senate: ‘‘[And] if we cannot be
civil to one another, and if we stop
dealing with those with whom we dis-
agree, or that we don’t like, we would
soon stop functioning altogether.’’
With that in mind, my time in the
Senate is going to be focused on action
and accomplishment—things that will
lead to positive change.
Many times, people have asked me:
What is one of your strengths? What do
you think helps you in the political
process?
I have repeatedly said: I am a pretty
good change agent.
That is something we need to do to
fully function and to serve our Nation.
Tennessee has constituencies across
every sector of our Nation’s economy,
and they are wanting change. They
want fair and free markets, less regula-
tion, less taxation, and less litigation.
Our industries are in agriculture, en-
ergy production, financial services, na-
tional security installations, veterans
hospitals, world-class universities,
healthcare, manufacturing, tech-
nology, entertainment, and commu-
nications.
In Tennessee, we are a logistics hub,
with great networks and intermodal fa-
cilities. As a member of the Senate
Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation Committee, I am going to work
with them to make certain that when
the Federal Government shows up, it is
there to be a help and not a hindrance.
Tennessee is a cultural leader and is
the Nation’s center for music, song-
writing, and religion. The people want
protection of the works they create
and of the sermons they preach.
Tennesseans also tell me that as
their Senator, they want me to be
aware they are concerned about the fu-
ture of the Nation. It is unimaginable
to Tennesseans that nearly three dec-
ades after the end of the Cold War,
there is a debate in Washington about,
are you for socialism or are you for
freedom? They cannot believe this is
happening. They want to make certain
we are going to continue to push for-
ward and protect this Nation and pro-
tect our freedoms that we have. We
will continue to do that and to push
back.
We have a lot of challenges we are
going to face. Tennesseans want to
make certain that we are going to be
there to focus on prosperity and leader-
ship for future generations. This is
going to require our paying attention
to technology. My colleagues will find
that I am going to work to push for 5G
and next-generation technologies for
both our commercial and military
space.
Senator BALDWIN and I are intro-
ducing bipartisan legislation to ad-
vance rural broadband, and I have
joined Senators GARDNER and CORTEZ
MASTO on the ACCESS BROADBAND
Act to make resources available to
rural communities. Technology is not
only enabled by freedom, it enhances
freedom.
Make no mistake, our technology
and our power are being challenged by
all of our adversaries. Primary among
them is Communist China, which is a
threat to our country because it steals
our technology, our innovations, and in
its unfair trading practices and mone-
tary policy. We should all be united in
taking on the Chinese. Our Ten-
nesseans talk to me regularly about
their concerns about some of the theft
that takes place by China. We have
other enemies as well—from Maduro in
Venezuela to the Ayatollahs in Iran, to
Kim Jong Un in North Korea. We must
stand together as Americans if we are
to advance the cause of freedom.
Tennesseans have been clear in what
they want and in what they expect
from their U.S. Senator. They want
somebody who is going to listen to
them and be concerned about the sto-
ries of their lives, not the DC story of
the day. Tennesseans are ready for bold
ideas on how the Federal Government
should spend their taxpayer dollars.
They don’t want tweaks around the
edges of bills; they want something
bold. They are concerned about how we
are going to fund the military. They
are concerned about what we are going
to do to further our presence in this
land.
Tennesseans want a Senator who will
respect freedom and the rule of law. It
is a beautiful and diverse State. It rep-
resents the best of what this Nation
has to offer. Our history reflects a com-
mon set of values that are based on
faith, family freedom, hope, and oppor-
tunity, and I look forward to working
with my colleagues to preserve these
values and to fight back against those
who would attempt to undermine
them.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). The majority leader.
ORDER OF PROCEDURE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that all
postcloture time on the Wyrick nomi-
nation expire at 5:30, Tuesday, April 9;
further, that if confirmed, the motion
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table and the President
be immediately notified of the Senate’s
action. I further ask unanimous con-
sent that the mandatory quorum call
with respect to the Stanton nomina-
tion be waived; finally, that notwith-
standing the provisions of rule XXII,
the cloture motion on the Abizaid nom-
ination be withdrawn and the Senate
vote on his confirmation at a time to
be determined by the majority leader,
in consultation with the Democratic
leader, on April 10, 2019.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. JONES. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.’S LETTER FROM
BIRMINGHAM JAIL
Mr. JONES. Madam President, I rise
today to honor a great American, an
American whose words lit a flame of
hope in the hearts of those souls who
had become weary with the weight of
injustice, an American whose strug-
gles, ideals—and, yes, his dreams—are
etched in the foundation of our Nation.
On April 12, 1963, Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., was arrested in my home-
town of Birmingham, AL. His crime?
Leading a peaceful march to protest
the indignity suffered by the Black
community in the Jim Crow era. He
had violated Birmingham public safety
commissioner ‘‘Bull’’ Connor’s ban on
public demonstrations, which targeted
the growing resistance of African
Americans to the injustices they were
suffering.
While in solitary confinement in Bir-
mingham, Dr. King wrote what became
known as the ‘‘Letter from Bir-
mingham Jail’’—a stinging response to
a group of White clergy in Alabama
who had denounced his tactics and
questioned the wisdom and timing of
his arrival in Birmingham.
They insisted that he was an outside
agitator coming to Alabama to insti-
gate trouble. Dr. King responded fa-
mously: ‘‘Injustice anywhere is a
threat to justice everywhere.’’
In his letter, he rejected the idea
that African Americans should be more
patient for change in the face of the
daily indignities inflicted by segrega-
tion and in the face of violence and
threats and intimidation. He wrote:
‘‘There comes a time when the cup of
endurance runs over.’’
While I did not experience this strug-
gle as a young child—a young White
child growing up in the nearby Bir-
mingham suburb—I spent much of my
adult life and career as a lawyer and
former U.S. attorney examining the
history and absorbing its lessons. I
have often returned to Dr. King’s letter
to understand the forces at play at the
height of the civil rights struggle. Each
time I read his words, I am in awe of
his courage and resolve in the face of
such incredible personal risk.
While we have come so far and while
we have made great progress in loos-
ening the binds of racial injustice that
have constrained and suffocated our
Nation for so many years, we have not
yet fully relieved the weight of our
country’s abominable history of slav-
ery, segregation, and racial discrimina-
tion.
That is why I rise today. It is our
civic duty and I believe our moral obli-
gation to remember Dr. King’s words
and his deeds, to tell his story, to ap-
preciate that 1963 was not all that long
ago, and to reflect on how many things
have changed and how many have not.
Our obligation is to honor Dr. King’s

legacy by joining him in envisioning
the mountaintop and working to make
real his famous dream that our Nation
will rise up and live out the true mean-
ing of the creed: ‘‘We hold these truths
to be self-evident, that all men are cre-
ated equal.’’ That is why we rise today.
Dr. King saw an America that had
the potential to live up to its lofty
ideals, where every man, woman, and
child had an equal opportunity to suc-
ceed and to live a life free from dis-
crimination. He saw the good in our
country when it would have been easier
for him to see the bad. It is that posi-
tive spirit and clarity of vision that
made his legacy so enduring.
Today, we will honor that legacy by
reading the letter from the Bir-
mingham jail in its entirety in the
Senate Chamber.
I am honored to be joined today by
Martin Luther King III, who is in the
Gallery—the oldest son of Dr. King and
Coretta Scott King—as well as my old
friend Charles Steele, the president of
the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and a reverend. Together,
they are at the forefront of the modern
civil rights movement and personally
carry on the legacy that Dr. King be-
queathed us.
I am also very grateful that several
of my colleagues on both sides of the
political aisle will stand with me to
read portions of the letter today. I
want to thank Senators LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER of Tennessee, TED CRUZ of
Texas, KAMALA HARRIS of California,
TIM KAINE of Virginia, and LISA MUR-
KOWSKI of Alaska for participating in
this historic reading today.
I urge the rest of our colleagues, any-
one in the Gallery, and anyone watch-
ing at home on television to consider
what we might still learn today from
this powerful message about justice
and freedom from oppression and the
indifference of people who stand idly
by when their fellow Americans are
persecuted.
To begin the reading of the letter, I
would like to yield to my colleague
from Tennessee, my friend Senator
ALEXANDER.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
I thank the Senator from Alabama for
including me today in the reading of
Dr. King’s letter from the Birmingham
jail.
Senator JONES has standing to do
this not just because he is from Ala-
bama but because of his work as a U.S.
attorney prosecuting Klansmen who
blew up a church on 16th Street in Bir-
mingham, killing children.
Senator JONES said that all of this
was not too long ago. It was not too
long ago for me. I remember a day—on
August 28, 1963. I was a student at that
time at New York University School of
Law with an internship in the U.S. De-
partment of Justice. It was a hot sum-
mer day, and the streets were filled
with the March on Washington. It was
about lunchtime, I believe, that I went
outside into that crowd, and I heard a
booming voice from a man who was
standing on the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial. I heard the words that he
hoped his four little children one day
would ‘‘live in a nation where they will
not be judged by the color of their
skin.’’ I am not sure, at that time and
at that age, that I understood fully
what I was seeing and hearing, but I
was hearing Dr. King’s ‘‘I Have a
Dream’’ speech.
In 1962, a year earlier, I was a senior
at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
It was not that long ago, but a lot has
changed since then. Vanderbilt, a pres-
tigious institution, just in that year
was desegregating its undergraduate
school. I was a part of that effort. But
even then, Black Americans couldn’t
go to the same restaurants, stay at the
same motels, or go to the same bath-
rooms—even then, and it was not that
long ago.
Four months before I heard Dr. King
speak in August of 1963, he wrote a let-
ter from the Birmingham jail on the
16th of April, 1963. This was Dr. King’s
letter:
My Dear Fellow Clergymen:
While confined here in the Birmingham
city jail, I came across your recent state-
ment calling my present activities ‘‘unwise
and untimely.’’
Dr. King’s letter went on to say:
I think I should indicate why I am here in
Birmingham, since you have been influenced
by the view which argues against ‘‘outsiders
coming in.’’ I have the honor of serving as
president of the Southern Christian Leader-
ship Conference, an organization operating
in every southern state, with headquarters
in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty
five affiliated organizations across the
South, and one of them is the Alabama
Christian Movement for Human Rights. Fre-
quently we share staff, educational and fi-
nancial resources with our affiliates. Several
months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham
asked us to be on call to engage in a non-
violent direct action program if such were
deemed necessary. We readily consented, and
when the hour came we lived up to our prom-
ise. So I, along with several members of my
staff, am here because I was invited here. I
am here because I have organizational ties
here.
But more basically, I am in Birmingham
because injustice is here. Just as the proph-
ets of the eighth century B.C. left their vil-
lages and carried their ‘‘thus saith the Lord’’
far beyond the boundaries of their home
towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his
village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of
Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco
Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the
gospel of freedom beyond my own home
town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond
to the Macedonian call for aid.
Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelat-
edness of all communities and states. I can-
not sit idly by in Atlanta and not be con-
cerned about what happens in Birmingham.
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice ev-
erywhere. We are caught in an inescapable
network of mutuality, tied in a single gar-
ment of destiny. Whatever affects one di-
rectly, affects all indirectly. Never again can
we afford to live with the narrow, provincial
‘‘outside agitator’’ idea. Anyone who lives
inside the United States can never be consid-
ered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.
You deplore the demonstrations taking
place in Birmingham. But your statement, I
am sorry to say, fails to express a similar
concern for the conditions that brought
about the demonstrations. I am sure that
none of you would want to rest content with
the superficial kind of social analysis that
deals merely with effects and does not grap-
ple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate
that demonstrations are taking place in Bir-
mingham, but it is even more unfortunate
that the city’s white power structure left the
Negro community with no alternative.
In any nonviolent campaign there are four
basic steps: collection of the facts to deter-
mine whether injustices exist; negotiation;
self purification; and direct action. We have
gone through all these steps in Birmingham.
There can be no gainsaying the fact that ra-
cial injustice engulfs this community. Bir-
mingham is probably the most thoroughly
segregated city in the United States. Its ugly
record of brutality is widely known. Negroes
have experienced grossly unjust treatment in
the courts. There have been more unsolved
bombings of Negro homes and churches in
Birmingham than in any other city in the
nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of
the case. On the basis of these conditions,
Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the
city fathers. But the latter consistently re-
fused to engage in good faith negotiation.
Dr. King’s letter continues:
Then, last September, came the oppor-
tunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham’s
economic community. In the course of the
negotiations, certain promises were made by
the merchants—for example, to remove the
stores’ humiliating racial signs. On the basis
of these promises, the Reverend Fred
Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Ala-
bama Christian Movement for Human Rights
agreed to a moratorium on all demonstra-
tions. As the weeks and months went by, we
realized that we were the victims of a broken
promise. A few signs, briefly removed, re-
turned; the others remained. As the weeks
and months went by, we realized that we
were the victims of a broken promise. A few
signs, briefly removed, returned; the others
remained. As in so many past experiences,
our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow
of deep disappointment settled upon us. We
had no alternative except to prepare for di-
rect action, whereby we would present our
very bodies as a means of laying our case be-
fore the conscience of the local and the na-
tional community. Mindful of the difficulties
involved, we decided to undertake a process
of self purification. We began a series of
workshops on nonviolence, and we repeat-
edly asked ourselves: ‘‘Are you able to ac-
cept blows without retaliating?’’ ‘‘Are you
able to endure the ordeal of jail?’’
Dr. King’s letter continues:
We decided to schedule our direct action
program for the Easter season, realizing that
except for Christmas, this is the main shop-
ping period of the year. Knowing that a
strong economic-withdrawal program would
be the by product of direct action, we felt
that this would be the best time to bring
pressure to bear on the merchants for the
needed change.
Then it occurred to us that Birmingham’s
mayoral election was coming up in March,
and we speedily decided to postpone action
until after election day. When we discovered
that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eu-
gene ‘‘Bull’’ Connor, had piled up enough
votes to be in the run off, we decided again
to postpone action until the day after the
run off so that the demonstrations could not
be used to cloud the issues.
Dr. King continued:
Like many others, we waited to see Mr.
Connor defeated, and to this end we endured
postponement after postponement. Having

aided in this community need, we felt that
our direct action program could be delayed
no longer.
Madam President, I yield the floor to
the Senator from California, Ms. HAR-
RIS.
Ms. HARRIS. I thank the Senator
from Tennessee.
Dr. King continues:
You may well ask: ‘‘Why direct action?
Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn’t ne-
gotiation a better path?’’ You are quite right
in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the
very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent di-
rect action seeks to create such a crisis and
foster such a tension that a community
which has constantly refused to negotiate is
forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to
dramatize the issue that it can no longer be
ignored. My citing the creation of tension as
part of the work of the nonviolent resister
may sound rather shocking. But I must con-
fess that I am not afraid of the word ‘‘ten-
sion.’’ I have earnestly opposed violent ten-
sion, but there is a type of constructive, non-
violent tension which is necessary for
growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was nec-
essary to create a tension in the mind so
that individuals could rise from the bondage
of myths and half truths to the unfettered
realm of creative analysis and objective ap-
praisal, so must we see the need for non-
violent gadflies to create the kind of tension
in society that will help men rise from the
dark depths of prejudice and racism to the
majestic heights of understanding and broth-
erhood. The purpose of our direct action pro-
gram is to create a situation so crisis packed
that it will inevitably open the door to nego-
tiation. I therefore concur with you in your
call for negotiation. Too long has our be-
loved Southland been bogged down in a trag-
ic effort to live in monologue rather than
dialogue.
One of the basic points in your statement
is that the action that I and my associates
have taken in Birmingham is untimely.
Some have asked: ‘‘Why didn’t you give the
new city administration time to act?’’ The
only answer that I can give to this query is
that the new Birmingham administration
must be prodded about as much as the out-
going one, before it will act. We are sadly
mistaken if we feel that the election of Al-
bert Boutwell as mayor will bring the mil-
lennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell
is a much more gentle person than Mr. Con-
nor, they are both segregationists, dedicated
to maintenance of the status quo. I have
hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable
enough to see the futility of massive resist-
ance to desegregation. But he will not see
this without pressure from devotees of civil
rights. My friends, I must say to you that we
have not made a single gain in civil rights
without determined legal and nonviolent
pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact
that privileged groups seldom give up their
privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see
the moral light and voluntarily give up their
unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has
reminded us, groups tend to be more im-
moral than individuals.
We know through painful experience that
freedom is never voluntarily given by the op-
pressor; it must be demanded by the op-
pressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a
direct action campaign that was ‘‘well
timed’’ in the view of those who have not
suffered unduly from the disease of segrega-
tion. For years now I have heard the word
‘‘Wait!’’ It rings in the ear of every Negro
with piercing familiarity. This ‘‘Wait’’ has
almost always meant ‘‘Never.’’ We must
come to see, with one of our distinguished
jurists, that ‘‘justice too long delayed is jus-
tice denied.’’
We have waited for more than 340 years for
our constitutional and God given rights. The
nations of Asia and Africa are moving with
jetlike speed toward gaining political inde-
pendence, but we still creep at horse and
buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at
a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those
who have never felt the stinging darts of seg-
regation to say, ‘‘Wait.’’ But when you have
seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and
fathers at will and drown your sisters and
brothers at whim; when you have seen hate
filled policemen curse, kick and even kill
your black brothers and sisters; when you
see the vast majority of your twenty million
Negro brothers smothering in an airtight
cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent
society; when you suddenly find your tongue
twisted and your speech stammering as you
seek to explain to your six year old daughter
why she can’t go to the public amusement
park that has just been advertised on tele-
vision, and see tears welling up in her eyes
when she is told that Funtown is closed to
colored children, and see ominous clouds of
inferiority beginning to form in her little
mental sky, and see her beginning to distort
her personality by developing an uncon-
scious bitterness toward white people; when
you have to concoct an answer for a five year
old son who is asking: ‘‘Daddy, why do white
people treat colored people so mean?’’; when
you take a cross county drive and find it
necessary to sleep night after night in the
uncomfortable corners of your automobile
because no motel will accept you; when you
are humiliated day in and day out by nag-
ging signs reading ‘‘white’’ and ‘‘colored’’;
when your first name becomes ‘‘nigger,’’
your middle name becomes ‘‘boy’’ (however
old you are) and your last name becomes
‘‘John,’’ and your wife and mother are never
given the respected title ‘‘Mrs.’’; when you
are harried by day and haunted by night by
the fact that you are a Negro, living con-
stantly at tiptoe stance, never quite know-
ing what to expect next, and are plagued
with inner fears and outer resentments;
when you are forever fighting a degenerating
sense of ‘‘nobodiness’’—then you will under-
stand why [I] find it difficult to wait.
I would now like to yield to my col-
league Senator CRUZ from Texas.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, Dr.
King’s profoundly just and moral letter
from the Birmingham jail continued:
There comes a time when the cup of endur-
ance runs over, and men are no longer will-
ing to be plunged into the abyss of despair.
I hope, sirs, you can understand our legiti-
mate and unavoidable impatience. You ex-
press a great deal of anxiety over our will-
ingness to break laws. This is certainly a le-
gitimate concern. Since we so diligently
urge people to obey the Supreme Court’s de-
cision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the
public schools, at first glance it may seem
rather paradoxical for us consciously to
break laws. One may well ask: ‘‘How can you
advocate breaking some laws and obeying
others?’’ The answer lies in the fact that
there are two types of laws: Just and unjust.
I would be the first to advocate obeying just
laws. One has not only a legal but a moral
responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely,
one has a moral responsibility to disobey un-
just laws. I would agree with St. Augustine
that ‘‘an unjust law is no law at all.’’
Now, what is the difference between the
two? How does one determine whether a law
is just or unjust? A just law is a man made
code that squares with the moral law or the
law of God. An unjust law is a code that is
out of harmony with the moral law. To put
it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An
unjust law is a human law that is not rooted
in eternal law and natural law. Any law that
uplifts human personality is just. Any law
that degrades human personality is unjust.
All segregation statutes are unjust because
segregation distorts the soul and damages
the personality. It gives the segregator a
false sense of superiority and the segregated
a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to
use the terminology of the Jewish philoso-
pher Martin Buber, substitutes an ‘‘I it’’ re-
lationship for an ‘‘I thou’’ relationship and
ends up relegating persons to the status of
things. Hence segregation is not only politi-
cally, economically and sociologically un-
sound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul
Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not
segregation an existential expression of
man’s tragic separation, his awful estrange-
ment, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that
I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of
the Supreme Court, for it is morally right;
and I can urge them to disobey segregation
ordinances, for they are morally wrong.
Let us consider a more concrete example of
just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code
that a numerical or power majority group
compels a minority group to obey but does
not make binding on itself. This is difference
made legal. By the same token, a just law is
a [law] that a majority compels a minority
to follow and that it is willing to follow
itself. This is sameness made legal. Let me
give another explanation. A law is unjust if
it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result
of being denied the right to vote, had no part
in enacting or devising the law. Who can say
that the legislature of Alabama which set up
that state’s segregation laws was democrat-
ically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts
of devious methods are used to prevent Ne-
groes from becoming registered voters, and
there are some counties in which, even
though Negroes constitute a majority of the
population, not a single Negro is registered.
Can any law enacted under such cir-
cumstances be considered democratically
structured?
Sometimes a law is just on its face and un-
just in its application. For instance, I have
been arrested on a charge of parading with-
out a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in
having an ordinance which requires a permit
for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes
unjust when it is used to maintain segrega-
tion and to deny citizens the First Amend-
ment privilege of peaceful assembly and pro-
test.
I hope you are able to see the distinction I
am trying to point out. In no sense do I advo-
cate evading or defying the law, as would the
rabid segregationist. That would lead to an-
archy. One who breaks an unjust law must
do so openly, lovingly, and with a willing-
ness to accept the penalty. I submit that an
individual who breaks the law that con-
science tells him is unjust, and who willingly
accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order
to arouse the conscience of the community
over its injustice, is in reality expressing the
highest respect for law.
Of course, there is nothing new about this
kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced
sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of
Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher
moral law was at stake. It was practiced su-
perbly by the early Christians, who were
willing to face hungry lions and the excru-
ciating pain of chopping blocks rather than
submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman
Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a
reality today because Socrates practiced
civil disobedience. In our own nation, the
Boston Tea Party represented a massive act
of civil disobedience.
We should never forget that everything
Adolf Hitler did in Germany was ‘‘legal’’ and

everything that the Hungarian freedom
fighters did in Hungary was ‘‘illegal.’’ It was
‘‘illegal’’ to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s
Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I
lived in Germany at the time, I would have
aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If
today I lived in a Communist country where
certain principles dear to the Christian faith
are suppressed, I would openly advocate dis-
obeying that country’s antireligious laws.
I must make two honest confessions to
you, my Christian and Jewish brothers.
First, I must confess that over the past few
years I have been gravely disappointed with
the white moderate. I have almost reached
the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s
great stumbling block in his stride toward
freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler
or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white mod-
erate, who is more devoted to ‘‘order’’ than
to justice; who prefers a negative peace
which is the absence of tension to a positive
peace which is the presence of justice; who
constantly says: ‘‘I agree with you in the
goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your
methods of direct action’’; who
paternalistically believes he can set the
timetable for another man’s freedom; who
lives by a mythical concept of time and who
constantly advises the Negro to wait for a
‘‘more convenient season.’’ Shallow under-
standing from people of goodwill is more
frustrating than absolute misunderstanding
from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance
is much more bewildering than outright re-
jection.
I had hoped that the white moderate would
understand that law and order exist for the
purpose of establishing justice and that when
they fail in this purpose they become the
dangerously structured dams that block the
flow of social progress. I had hoped that the
white moderate would understand that the
present tension in the South is a necessary
phase of the transition from an obnoxious
negative peace, in which the Negro passively
accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive
and positive peace, in which all men will re-
spect the dignity and worth of human per-
sonality. Actually, we who engage in non-
violent direct action are not the creators of
tension. We merely bring to the surface the
hidden tension that is already alive. We
bring it out in the open, where it can be seen
and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be
cured so long as it is covered up but must be
opened with all its ugliness for the natural
medicines of air and light, injustice must be
exposed, with all the tension its exposure
creates, to the light of human conscience
and the air of national opinion before it can
be cured.
Madam President, I yield to the Sen-
ator from Virginia.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
Mr. KAINE. I thank the Senator from
Texas.
Continuing:
In your statement you assert that our ac-
tions, even though peaceful, must be con-
demned because they precipitate violence.
But is this a logical assertion? Isn’t this like
condemning a robbed man because his pos-
session of money precipitated the evil act of
robbery? Isn’t this like condemning Socrates
because his unswerving commitment to
truth and his philosophical inquiries precip-
itated the act by the misguided populace in
which they made him drink hemlock? Isn’t
this like condemning Jesus because his
unique God consciousness and never ceasing
devotion to God’s will precipitated the evil
act of crucifixion? We must come to see that,
as the federal courts have consistently af-
firmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to
cease his efforts to gain his basic constitu-
tional rights because the quest may precipi-
tate violence. Society must protect the
robbed and punish the robber. I had also
hoped that the white moderate would reject
the myth concerning time in relation to the
struggle for freedom. I have just received a
letter from a white brother in Texas. He
writes: ‘‘All Christians know that the col-
ored people will receive equal rights eventu-
ally, but it is possible that you are in too
great a religious hurry. It has taken Christi-
anity almost two thousand years to accom-
plish what it has. The teachings of Christ
take time to come to earth.’’ Such an atti-
tude stems from a tragic misconception of
time, from the strangely irrational notion
that there is something in the very flow of
time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actu-
ally, time itself is neutral; it can be used ei-
ther destructively or constructively. More
and more I feel that the people of ill will
have used time much more effectively than
have the people of good will. We will have to
repent in this generation not merely for the
hateful words and actions of the bad people
but for the appalling silence of the good peo-
ple. Human progress never rolls in on wheels
of inevitability; it comes through the tire-
less efforts of men willing to be coworkers
with God, and without this hard work, time
itself becomes an ally of the forces of social
stagnation. We must use time creatively, in
the knowledge that the time is always ripe
to do right. Now is the time to make real the
promise of democracy and transform our
pending national elegy into a creative psalm
of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our
national policy from the quicksand of racial
injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.
You speak of our activity in Birmingham
as extreme. At first I was rather dis-
appointed that fellow clergymen would see
my nonviolent efforts as those of an extrem-
ist. I began thinking about the fact that I
stand in the middle of two opposing forces in
the Negro community. One is a force of com-
placency, made up in part of Negroes who, as
a result of long years of oppression, are so
drained of self respect in the sense of
‘‘somebodiness’’ that they have adjusted to
segregation; and in part of a few middle-class
Negroes who, because of a degree of aca-
demic and economic security and because in
some ways they profit by segregation, have
become insensitive to the problems of the
masses. The other force is one of bitterness
and hatred, and it comes perilously close to
advocating violence. It is expressed in the
various black nationalist groups that are
springing up across the nation, the largest
and best known being Elijah Muhammad’s
Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro’s
frustration over the continued existence of
racial discrimination, this movement is
made up of people who have lost faith in
America, who have absolutely repudiated
Christianity, and who have concluded that
the white man is an incorrigible ‘‘devil.’’
I have tried to stand between these two
forces, saying that we need emulate neither
the ‘‘do nothingism’’ of the complacent nor
the hatred and despair of the black nation-
alist. For there is the more excellent way of
love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to
God that, through the influence of the Negro
church, the way of nonviolence became an
integral part of our struggle. If this philos-
ophy had not emerged, by now many streets
of the South would, I am convinced, be flow-
ing with blood. And I am further convinced
that if our white brothers dismiss as ‘‘rabble
rousers’’ and ‘‘outside agitators’’ those of us
who employ nonviolent direct action, and if
they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts,
millions of Negroes will, out of frustration
and despair, seek solace and security in
black nationalist ideologies—a development
that would inevitably lead to a frightening
racial nightmare.
Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed
forever. The yearning for freedom eventually
manifests itself, and that is what has hap-
pened to the American Negro. Something
within has reminded him of his birthright of
freedom, and something without has re-
minded him that it can be gained. Con-
sciously or unconsciously, he has been
caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his
black brothers of Africa and his brown and
yellow brothers of Asia, South America and
the Caribbean, the United States Negro is
moving with a sense of great urgency toward
the promised land of racial justice. If one
recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed
the Negro community, one should readily
understand why public demonstrations are
taking place. The Negro has many pent up
resentments and latent frustrations, and he
must release them. So let him march; let
him make prayer pilgrimages to the city
hall; let him go on freedom rides—and try to
understand why he must do so. If his re-
pressed emotions are not released in non-
violent ways, they will seek expression
through violence; this is not a threat but a
fact of history.
So I have not said to my people, ‘‘Get rid
of your discontent.’’ Rather, I have tried to
say that this normal and healthy discontent
can be channeled through into the creative
outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now
this approach is being termed extremist. But
though I was initially disappointed at being
categorized as an extremist, as I continued
to think about the matter I gradually gained
a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was
not Jesus an extremist for love: ‘‘Love your
enemies, bless them that curse you, do good
to them that hate you, and pray for them
which despitefully use you, and persecute
you.’’ Was not Amos an extremist for justice:
‘‘Let justice roll down like waters and right-
eousness like an ever flowing stream.’’ Was
not Paul an extremist for the Christian gos-
pel: ‘‘I bear in my body the marks of the
Lord Jesus.’’ Was not Martin Luther an ex-
tremist: ‘‘Here I stand; I cannot do other-
wise, so help me God.’’ And John Bunyan: ‘‘I
will stay in jail to the end of my days before
I make a butchery of my conscience.’’ And
Abraham Lincoln: ‘‘This nation cannot sur-
vive half slave and half free.’’ And Thomas
Jefferson: ‘‘We hold these truths to be self
evident, that all men are created equal . . .’’
So the question is not whether we will be ex-
tremists, but what kind of extremists we will
be. Will we be extremists for hate or for
love? Will we be extremists for the preserva-
tion of injustice or for the extension of jus-
tice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary’s hill
three men were crucified. We must never for-
get that all three were crucified for the same
crime—the crime of extremism. Two were
extremists for immorality, and thus fell
below their environment. The other, Jesus
Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and
goodness, and thereby rose above his envi-
ronment. Perhaps the South, the nation and
the world are in dire need of creative ex-
tremists.
I yield to the Senator from Alaska.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Alaska.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. He continues:
I had hoped that the white moderate would
see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic;
perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I
should have realized that few members of the
oppressor race can understand the deep
groans and passionate yearnings of the op-
pressed race, and still fewer have the vision
to see that injustice must be rooted out by
strong, persistent and determined action. I

S2312 April 9, 2019
white brothers in the South have grasped the
meaning of this social revolution and com-
mitted themselves to it. They are still all
too few in quantity, but they are big in qual-
ity. Some—such as Ralph McGill, Lillian
Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs,
Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle—have
written about our struggle in eloquent and
prophetic terms. Others have marched with
us down nameless streets of the South. They
have languished in filthy, roach infested
jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of po-
licemen who view them as ‘‘dirty nigger-
lovers.’’ Unlike so many of their moderate
brothers and sisters, they have recognized
the urgency of the moment and sensed the
need for powerful ‘‘action’’ antidotes to com-
bat the disease of segregation. Let me take
note of my other major disappointment. I
have been so greatly disappointed with the
white church and its leadership. Of course,
there are some notable exceptions. I am not
unmindful of the fact that each of you has
taken some significant stands on this issue.
I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your
Christian stand on this past Sunday, in wel-
coming Negroes to your worship service on a
nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic
leaders of this state for integrating Spring
Hill College several years ago.
But despite these notable exceptions, I
must honestly reiterate that I have been dis-
appointed with the church. I do not say this
as one of those negative critics who can al-
ways find something wrong with the church.
I say this as a minister of the gospel, who
loves the church; who was nurtured in its
bosom; who has been sustained by its spir-
itual blessings and who will remain true to it
as long as the cord of life shall lengthen.
When I was suddenly catapulted into the
leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery,
Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be
supported by the white church. I felt that
the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the
South would be among our strongest allies.
Instead, some have been outright opponents,
refusing to understand the freedom move-
ment and misrepresenting its leaders; all too
many others have been more cautious than
courageous and have remained silent behind
the anesthetizing security of stained glass
windows. In spite of my shattered dreams, I
came to Birmingham with the hope that the
white religious leadership of this community
would see the justice of our cause and, with
deep moral concern, would serve as the chan-
nel through which our just grievances could
reach the power structure. I had hoped that
each of you would understand. But again I
have been disappointed.
I have heard numerous southern religious
leaders admonish their worshipers to comply
with a desegregation decision because it is
the law, but I have longed to hear white min-
isters declare: ‘‘Follow this decree because
integration is morally right and because the
Negro is your brother.’’ In the midst of bla-
tant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I
have watched white churchmen stand on the
sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and
sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a
mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial
and economic injustice, I have heard many
ministers say: ‘‘Those are social issues, with
which the gospel has no real concern.’’ And I
have watched many churches commit them-
selves to a completely other worldly religion
which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinc-
tion between body and soul, between the sa-
cred and the secular.
I have traveled the length and breadth of
Alabama, Mississippi and all the other
southern states. On sweltering summer days
and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at
the South’s beautiful churches with their
lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have be-
held the impressive outlines of her massive
religious education buildings. Over and over
I have found myself asking: ‘‘What kind of
people worship here? Who is their God?
Where were their voices when the lips of
Governor Barnett dripped with words of
interposition and nullification? Where were
they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion
call for defiance and hatred? Where were
their voices of support when bruised and
weary Negro men and women decided to rise
from the dark dungeons of complacency to
the bright hills of creative protest?’’
Yes, these questions are still in my mind.
In deep disappointment I have wept over the
laxity of the church. But be assured that my
tears have been tears of love. There can be
no deep disappointment where there is not
deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could
I do otherwise? I am in the rather unique po-
sition of being the son, the grandson and the
great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the
church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How
we have blemished and scarred that body
through social neglect and through fear of
being nonconformists.
There was a time when the church was
very powerful—in the time when the early
Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy
to suffer for what they believed. In those
days the church was not merely a thermom-
eter that recorded the ideas and principles of
popular opinion; it was a thermostat that
transformed the mores of society. Whenever
the early Christians entered a town, the peo-
ple in power became disturbed and imme-
diately sought to convict the Christians for
being ‘‘disturbers of the peace’’ and ‘‘outside
agitators.’’ But the Christians pressed on, in
the conviction that they were ‘‘a colony of
heaven,’’ called to obey God rather than
man. Small in number, they were big in com-
mitment. They were too God-intoxicated to
be ‘‘astronomically intimidated.’’ By their
effort and example they brought an end to
such ancient evils as infanticide and glad-
iatorial contests. Things are different now.
So often the contemporary church is a weak,
ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So
often it is an archdefender of the status quo.
Far from being disturbed by the presence of
the church, the power structure of the aver-
age community is consoled by the church’s
silent—and often even vocal—sanction of
things as they are.
But the judgment of God is upon the
church as never before. If today’s church
does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of
the early church, it will lose its authen-
ticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be
dismissed as an irrelevant social club with
no meaning for the twentieth century. Every
day I meet young people whose disappoint-
ment with the church has turned into out-
right disgust.
Perhaps I have once again been too opti-
mistic. Is organized religion too inextricably
bound to the status quo to save our nation
and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith
to the inner spiritual church, the church
within the church, as the true ekklesia and
the hope of the world. But again I am thank-
ful to God that some noble souls from the
ranks of organized religion have broken
loose from the paralyzing chains of con-
formity and joined us as active partners in
the struggle for freedom. They have left
their secure congregations and walked the
streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They
have gone down the highways of the South
on tortuous rides for freedom.
Mr. President, I yield to my friend
from Alabama and thank him for his
leadership.
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, Dr. King
continues:
Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some
have been dismissed from their churches,
have lost the support of their bishops and
fellow ministers. But they have acted in the
faith that right defeated is stronger than
evil triumphant. Their witness has been the
spiritual salt that has preserved the true
meaning of the gospel in these troubled
times.
They have carved a tunnel of hope through
the dark mountain of disappointment. I hope
the church as a whole will meet the chal-
lenge of this decisive hour. But even if the
church does not come to the aid of justice, I
have no despair about the future. I have no
fear about the outcome of our struggle in
Birmingham, even if our motives are at
present misunderstood. We will reach the
goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over
the nation, because the goal of America is
freedom. Abused and scorned though we may
be, our destiny is tied up with America’s des-
tiny. Before the pilgrims landed at Plym-
outh, we were here. Before the pen of Jeffer-
son etched the majestic words of the Dec-
laration of Independence across the pages of
history, we were here. For more than two
centuries our forebears labored in this coun-
try without wages; they made cotton king;
they built the homes of their masters while
suffering gross injustice and shameful humil-
iation—and yet out of a bottomless vitality
they continued to thrive and develop. If the
inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not
stop us, the opposition we now face will sure-
ly fail. We will win our freedom because the
sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal
will of God are embodied in our echoing de-
mands. Before closing I feel impelled to men-
tion one other point in your statement that
has troubled me profoundly. You warmly
commended the Birmingham police force for
keeping ‘‘order’’ and ‘‘preventing violence.’’ I
doubt that you would have so warmly com-
mended the police force if you had seen its
dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, non-
violent Negroes. I doubt that you would so
quickly commend the policemen if you were
to observe their ugly and inhumane treat-
ment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you
were to watch them push and curse old
Negro women and young Negro girls; if you
were to see them slap and kick old Negro
men and young boys; if you were to observe
them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to
give us food because we wanted to sing our
grace together. I cannot join you in your
praise of the Birmingham police department.
It is true that the police have exercised a
degree of discipline in handling the dem-
onstrators. In this sense they have con-
ducted themselves rather ‘‘nonviolently’’ in
public. But for what purpose? To preserve
the evil system of segregation. Over the past
few years I have consistently preached that
nonviolence demands that the means we use
must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have
tried to make clear that it is wrong to use
immoral means to attain moral ends. But
now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or
perhaps even more so, to use moral means to
preserve immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor
and his policemen have been rather non-
violent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in
Albany, Georgia, but they have used the
moral means of nonviolence to maintain the
immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S.
Eliot has said: ‘‘The last temptation is the
greatest treason: To do the right deed for the
wrong reason.’’
I wish you had commended the Negro sit
inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for
their sublime courage, their willingness to
suffer and their amazing discipline in the
midst of great provocation. One day the
South will recognize its real heroes. They
will be the James Merediths, with the noble
sense of purpose that enables them to face
jeering and hostile mobs, and with the ago-
nizing loneliness that characterizes the life

of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed,
battered Negro women, symbolized in a sev-
enty two year old woman in Montgomery,
Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity
and with her people decided not to ride the
segregated buses, and who responded with
ungrammatical profundity to one who in-
quired about her weariness: ‘‘My feets is
tired, but my soul is at rest.’’ They will be
the young high school and college students,
the young ministers of the gospel and a host
of their elders, courageously and non-
violently sitting in at lunch counters and
willingly going to jail for conscience’ sake.
One day the South will know that when
these disinherited children of God sat down
at lunch counters, they were in reality
standing up for what is best in the American
dream and for the most sacred values in our
Judeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing
our nation back to those great wells of de-
mocracy which were dug deep by the found-
ing fathers in their formulation of the Con-
stitution and the Declaration of Independ-
ence.
Never before have I written so long a let-
ter. I’m afraid it is much too long to take
your precious time. I can assure you that it
would have been much shorter if I had been
writing from a comfortable desk, but what
else can one do when he is alone in a narrow
jail cell, other than write long letters, think
long thoughts, and pray long prayers?
If I have said anything in this letter that
overstates the truth and indicates an unrea-
sonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me.
If I have said anything that understates the
truth and indicates my having a patience
that allows me to settle for anything less
than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me.
I hope this letter finds you strong in the
faith. I also hope that circumstances will
soon make it possible for me to meet each of
you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights
leader but as a fellow clergymen and a Chris-
tian brother. Let us all hope that the dark
clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away
and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be
lifted from our fear drenched communities,
and in some not too distant tomorrow the ra-
diant stars of love and brotherhood will
shine over our great nation with all their
scintillating beauty.
Yours for the cause of Peace and Brother-
hood,
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
Mr. President, I am struck by a for-
tuitous phrase in the closing of this re-
markable letter: ‘‘One day the South
will recognize its real heroes.’’
The South will recognize its real he-
roes indeed—heroes like Dr. King, like
Rosa Parks, like my old friend Fred
Shuttlesworth; heroes like Congress-
man JOHN LEWIS, like Fannie Lou
Hamer, like Ida B. Wells; heroes like
the countless others who stood along-
side them in the fight for civil rights
and like the innocent victims swept up
in the brutal crackdowns during this
hopeful movement toward universal
human dignity.
We carry on their legacy in our daily
lives—in our schools, in our houses of
worship, in our workplaces, and
throughout our society. That includes
in the institution of the U.S. Senate. It
is also carried on in the work of Dr.
King’s family members, like Martin
Luther King III.
Dr. King wrote his letter in the midst
of this struggle and knew that much
work still lay ahead. Less than 6
months after his arrest, the Klan in
Birmingham planted a bomb outside
the ladies’ lounge of the 16th Street
Baptist Church, and it killed four inno-
cent young African-American girls.
A year later, though, Congress passed
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The year
after that, it passed the Voting Rights
Act of 1965. Historic changes were
afoot. Yet, despite this incredible his-
toric progress—or perhaps because of
it—in April 1968, Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., was assassinated in Mem-
phis, TN. He was just 39 years old. He
gave his life for this cause. He gave his
life in a struggle during which so many
gave their lives.
We have to remember this is not an-
cient history. We know that we still
have our challenges albeit in a world
that has, no doubt, benefited tremen-
dously from the progress he achieved,
but it is still a work in progress. It will
always be a work in progress.
If we truly believe in carrying on his
legacy, we must recognize that we can-
not stand idly by when we see injustice
and that we cannot stand idly by when
we see a reemergence of hateful rhet-
oric in our public discourse. We have
seen it before. We have seen it before in
Birmingham and elsewhere. We have
seen before the devastating violence
that can follow, and it lives with us
today. It lives with us today in trage-
dies like those of Charleston, Char-
lottesville, Pittsburgh, and now New
Zealand.
We need to strive not just for civility
but to make sure we live in a country
that does not hold each other in con-
tempt. That bears repeating. We talk a
lot in this Chamber about civility and
respect and dignity, but the fact is,
when we leave this Chamber and go out
into the world, people will hold each
other in contempt more so than is just
public discourse. That has to change,
ladies and gentlemen. It has to change.
Importantly, we—each of us—should
continue to do our part to ensure that
the art of the moral universe continues
to bend toward justice.
I thank my colleagues who joined me
this evening for this historic event. It
has been an honor and a privilege.
I yield the floor.

in the line of heroes that will I explain
in a moment. He was Ohio native Lt.
Col. Richard Cole, and he was the last
of the fabled Doolittle Raiders.
In the spring of 1942, the Nation was
reeling from Pearl Harbor, and 80
Americans embarked on a mission that
many thought to be impossible. They
knew the dangers. They knew many of
them would not come home. The Raid-
ers showed America and the world that
the United States and the Allied
Forces could win the war. It was con-
sidered a turning point in the news
coverage and in people’s minds.
Like my dad, the Doolittle Raiders
came from a generation that spoke
proudly of their service to their coun-
try. They rarely drew attention or
talked much about their own courage.
They sought no recognition but, oh,
how they earned it.
It was an honor to help award the
Congressional Gold Medal to the Doo-
little Raiders in Washington 4 years
ago—a long time in coming and so de-
served. I believe, at that time, there
were five Doolittle Raiders left, and
after the death of Mr. COLE, there are
none today.
I am so glad that Dick Cole was able
to live to receive that medal, as were a
handful of others. These men are no
longer with us, so it is all the more im-
portant that we continue to tell their
story. My heart goes out to the fami-
lies and friends of Lieutenant Colonel
Cole and to those of all the Raiders. I
thank the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders As-
sociation for keeping that memory
alive.
NOMINATION OF CHERYL MARIE STANTON
Madam President, President Trump
has made big promises to workers in
Alaska and Ohio and across the coun-
try. He has promised workers every-
where that he will put American work-
ers first. Yet we know in Lordstown
and from his court appointments,
which have put a thumb on the scale of
justice as they have chosen corpora-
tions over workers, that he has be-
trayed those workers. The people he
has put in charge haven’t looked out
for workers. Over and over again, they
have put their thumbs on the scale for
corporations. His Cabinet, frankly,
looks like a retreat for Wall Street.
His latest nominee for the Depart-
ment of Labor is more of the same, an-
other nominee who puts corporations
over workers. Cheryl Stanton is nomi-
nated to be Administrator of the Wage
and Hour Division.
This is not an especially well-known
Agency to most Americans, but it is a
critical job for all American workers.
The Administrator is the person in
charge of enforcing overtime rules, the
minimum wage, child labor, and the
Family Medical Leave Act. These are
all Federal laws. The minimum wage is
a Federal law. The overtime rule is a
Federal law. The Family Medical
Leave Act is a Federal law, as is the
law regarding child labor. These are all
Federal laws, but they don’t mean
much if they are not enforced.
You don’t want a fox in a chicken
coop. You want to make sure that
these laws are enforced by somebody
who is not on the side of corporate in-
terests, as too many in this Senate are
and as too many in this administration
are; you want somebody who is on the
side of the workers. The job of Admin-
istrator of the Wage and Hour Division
should be to look out for American
workers when companies try to cheat
them out of the pay that they have
earned.
But Ms. Stanton spent a decade de-
fending corporations—that is right, de-
fending the corporations against Amer-
ican workers when they stole workers’

wages. So she has been on the side of
these companies when workers tried to
make sure they got fair wages and fair
overtime and that child labor laws
were protected and the Family Medical
Leave Act. She has taken the other
side, that of the corporations. Now the
President has put her in a job where
she is supposed to look out for workers,
but who knows if she will really do
that.
Let’s look at some of her history: a
decade defending corporations and then
she headed South Carolina’s workforce
agency that manages State unemploy-
ment insurance. When accounting er-
rors resulted in overpayments of unem-
ployment insurance—these weren’t er-
rors made by workers; these were ac-
counting errors made that the workers
didn’t have anything to do with. When
accounting errors resulted in overpay-
ments of unemployment insurance to
workers looking for jobs, she went
after the workers, garnishing their
wages.
Maybe worst of all, interestingly, she
failed to pay her own house cleaners
until they took her to court. Think
about that. The person who is supposed
to be in charge of making sure corpora-
tions pay their workers, whether it is
minimum wage, whether it is overtime,
whether it is enforcing child labor
laws, whether it is enforcing the Fam-
ily Medical Leave Act—she is the per-
son who is supposed to be in charge of
making sure corporations pay their
workers, and she didn’t pay workers at
her own house.
If you want to get a measure of a per-
son, look at how they treat people
whom they are allowed to mistreat,
say it that way. Look at how they
treat people who have less power than
they do; how they treat the waitstaff
at a restaurant, how they treat the
entry-level staff in their office, how
they treat the person who cleans their
hotel room or cleans their office.
My favorite quote from the Bible—
one of my favorite quotes—is from
Matthew 25, when Jesus said as follows:
When I was hungry, you fed me; when I was
thirsty, you gave me drink; when I was a
stranger, you welcomed me. What you did for
the least of these, you did for me.
I thought about that, and I know
there is no way Jesus or Muhammad or
Buddha or any of the great religious
leaders would say somebody is worth
less than somebody else, that a page is
worth less than a Parliamentarian, for
instance, or that the Presiding Officer
is worth less than the person who is
sitting at the desk.
So Matthew 25 is exactly right. No
worker is worth less than Ms. Stanton.
No Senator is worth more or less than
anybody else. I mean, Matthew 25
speaks to equality, speaks to the sort
of way we should be treating people
who may have lesser titles than we
have.
I think of that when I think about
Ms. Stanton and the job she has been
nominated for. The workers whom she
will be in a position to help or hurt—
her career so far, she has been in posi-
tions where she has hurt workers, but
the position she is in that she can help
or hurt workers, these workers
shouldn’t be treated with less respect.
Their work has dignity. Whether they
swipe a badge or punch a clock, wheth-
er they work for tips, whether they
work on a salary, whether they raise
children, whether they take care of an
aging parent, their work has dignity.
If you love your country, you fight
for the people who make it work, re-
gardless of their kind of work. Whether
they are working construction, wheth-
er they are a nurse, whether they are a
housekeeper, whether they are a sales-
person, whether they work at a counter
in a fast-food restaurant, whether they
are a page, whether they are a Senator,
all work has dignity.
I think it is important, when you
think about Ms. Stanton and the job
she has, that these workers have
earned this pay, whether it is min-
imum wage, whether it is overtime,
whether it is child labor laws, whether
it is the Family Medical Leave Act.
When work has dignity, people are
paid the wages they earn; they are paid
a living wage; they have power over
their schedules. It is about wages; it is
about benefits; it is about the dignity
of work; and it is about a safe work-
place; it is about childcare. It is about
all of those things.
Workers should not be intimidated
into accepting less just because they
can’t afford a fancy law firm. We need
people in government who understand
that. We need people who understand
that, when you love this country, you
fight for those people who make it
work.
The last thing we need is an adminis-
tration with more people serving in
Washington who don’t value work or
respect the Americans who do.
This is another nominee from the
President of the United States who will
put her thumb or who has put his
thumb on the scale to support corpora-
tions over workers, to support Wall
Street over consumers, to support big
insurance companies over sick people.
We don’t need another one of those in
this administration, whether at EPA,
whether at the Department of Labor,
whether at the Federal Reserve, or
whether at the White House.
I urge my colleagues, as this nomina-
tion comes forward, as Ms. Stanton
comes forward to be Chief of the Wage
and Hour Division—Cheryl Stanton—to
be Administrator for the Wage and
Hour Division, I urge my colleagues to
listen a little more to the Americans
whom we serve and a little less to big
corporations that always have their
way in this body—always have their
way in this body. I urge my colleagues
to listen a little less to those corpora-
tions trying to squeeze every last
penny out of their workers and reject
this nomination.

RECOGNIZING OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise
to commend the incredible work done
by the men and women of Offutt Air
Force Base during the historic flooding
that has affected the State of Ne-
braska.
Offutt Air Force Base is home to
some of our Nation’s most essential
missions. The men and women of
STRATCOM stand constant vigil. They
provide command and control for the
U.S. nuclear deterrent and maintain
watch over space operations, missile
defense, and global strike.
Airmen of the 55th Wing execute
some of the most sensitive and com-
plex missions, ensuring that battlefield
commanders and the Nation’s decision
makers have the most up-to-date intel-
ligence, surveillance, and reconnais-
sance information available.
The Air Force’s only weather wing,
the 557th Weather Wing, provides time-
ly, accurate, and relevant weather in-
formation at any time and for any
place around the globe.
Throughout Offutt, many other ten-
ant units work in tandem with base
leadership to fulfill vital missions that
support our national security. These
men and women pride themselves on
being ready for every threat, but the
arrival of a once-in-50-year weather
event provided a test unlike any other
they have previously faced.
In 2019, Nebraska has seen severe
flooding—the worst and most wide-
spread natural disaster in the history
of our State. When the waters began to
rise, the lives of those at Offutt and the
base’s critical equipment were put at
risk, and the response was immediate.
With less than 48 hours to prepare,
highly essential aircraft such as the
RC–135 were quickly routed to safe lo-
cations. The planes that could not be
relocated were moved to higher ground.
Contingency plans were put in place to
ensure continuity of operations.
Across the installation, scores of air-
men turned out to answer the call and
move sensitive electronics and valu-
able equipment away from the reach of
damage, fighting as a team against the
oncoming flood.
Personnel worked around the clock
to fortify facilities with more than
235,000 sandbags and 460 flood barriers
to minimize damage as much as pos-
sible. These men and women mounted a
Herculean effort to defend their base
and do everything possible to protect
their fellow airmen.
Across Offutt, we have seen a re-
markable demonstration of what
makes this base so very special: every-
day airmen offering to do all they
could to protect the base, personnel
working tirelessly to ensure the highly
critical operations of STRATCOM and

the 55th Wing were not negatively im-
pacted, and, above all, a unifying spirit
of dedication and purpose that showed
the world that, when disaster strikes,
there is nothing that can keep the men
and women of Offutt Air Force Base
from answering the call of duty.
I am extremely proud to have the
privilege of representing everyone who
makes this base such a key part of our
national security. There is no finer rep-
resentation of what it means to serve
than the selfless work of the personnel
at Offutt who responded to this emer-
gency.
Despite the outstanding efforts made
in preparation for this natural disaster,
Mother Nature took a toll on the base.
At the flood’s peak, one-third of Offutt
Air Force Base was underwater. Eighty
facilities at the base have been im-
pacted, and waters crested at a depth
of 16 feet. More than 3,000 personnel
were displaced from their work centers,
and 1.2 million square feet of office
space was underwater.
The damage across the installation is
extensive, and it will take a concerted
effort to ensure that the impacts from
the flooding are resolved and that the
base is fully restored.
I urge my colleagues to work to-
gether with the Nebraska delegation to
ensure that when the full accounting of
the impacts from the flood are as-
sessed, we provide the Air Force with
the full resourcing it needs to repair
that damage.
The good news is, our service men
and women at Offutt are already hard
at work on the process of putting
Offutt back on its feet.
As the water recedes, personnel have
been working hard to account for the
damage and take action to resume the
operations that were suspended as a re-
sult of this disaster.
One of the signature sounds of the
Bellevue, NE, community is the distant
rumble of the engines of the aircraft
that depart from and land at Offutt
every day. During the flooding, that
unmistakable sound was absent. Now
that sound is back at Offutt.
Last week, the runway was certified
for operation, and the first of our relo-
cated planes came home.
We should not operate under any
misperceived notions that repairing
Offutt will happen overnight. This is
going to be a step-by-step process. But
with the hard work of the Air Force,
Congress, and the local community, we
can rebuild Offutt Air Force Base even
better than it was before.
I wish to offer my thanks to everyone
at Offutt Air Force Base who dedicated
their time and energy to responding to
this disaster. I also want to thank the
heroic men and women of the Nebraska
National Guard who provided aerial
damage assessment during the flood-
ing. Thank you to the countless mem-
bers of the Bellevue and Omaha com-
munities who donated food, equipment,
and offered to volunteer during the
flooding.
As we look to the days ahead, I am
confident that both Offutt and Ne-
braska will emerge from this disaster
stronger.
Now is a time when we must focus on
the future. We will rebuild and ensure
that Offutt remains Nebraska Strong.
Thank you.

NOMINATION OF CHERYL MARIE STANTON
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I come to
the floor this afternoon to speak in
support of my friend Cheryl Marie
Stanton, who is well qualified to be the
Administrator of the Wage and Hour
Division within the U.S. Department of
Labor. In her previous role as executive
director for the South Carolina Depart-
ment of Employment and Workforce,
she gained valuable experience that
will prepare her well for the role she is
about to take on within the U.S. De-
partment of Labor. She is also someone
who has vast experience in labor and
employment law, both in public life
and in the private sector. She also
served as Associate White House Coun-
sel, as liaison to the Department of
Labor.
Cheryl currently works at the Social
Security Administration as associate
to the Chief of Staff. She previously
served as the executive director for the
South Carolina Department of Employ-
ment and Workforce, to which she was
appointed by then-Governor Nikki
Haley in 2013.
Cheryl is someone I have known for
more than 20 years. Like me, Cheryl
served as a law clerk to then-Judge
Samuel Alito on the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Third Circuit. Although
we never clerked at the same time—she
clerked the year before, and I got to
know her through mutual friends ini-
tially and then got to know her inde-
pendently through that clerkship expe-
rience—she is someone who is well re-
garded within the Alito chambers as
being a hard-working law clerk and
someone who everyone enjoyed work-
ing with and getting to know.
I still remember many years ago,
when she was serving at the White
House Counsel’s Office as Associate
Counsel, she took my family and me on
a tour of the White House and showed
genuine interest in them. This is the
kind of person who comes with a lot of
academic and professional qualifica-
tions. When you add to that this X fac-
tor, this intangible factor of being
someone who is genuinely interested in
people, genuinely interested in their
well-being, their welfare, and making
sure they are informed and happy, this
is exactly the kind of person we would
want in a position like this one.
Her academic credentials are, of
course, impeccable. She received her
law degree from the University of Chi-
cago Law School and her under-
graduate degree from Williams College.
In short, Cheryl Stanton is someone I
look forward to voting for and con-
firming to this position within the De-
partment of Labor. I urge my col-
leagues to support her nomination.
Thank you.

HEALTHCARE
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it
seems that every week now, I come to
the floor to say the same thing, which
is that healthcare is not political; it is
personal. There is no part of healthcare
that is more personal than the decision
regarding if, when, and under what cir-
cumstances to have a child. And that
certainly is the case when things go
terribly wrong, which they sometimes
do. These reproductive health decisions
need to be made by women in consulta-
tion with their doctors, their families,
and their faith. That is what the Su-
preme Court has ruled. They should
not be made by politicians—mainly
men—looking to score political points
from women’s personal tragedies. Yet,
once again, that is what the Repub-
licans are doing right now.
I have a question. How dare you pre-
tend to care about the health of women
and babies when all of your actions
suggest otherwise?
Unfortunately, Republicans haven’t
noticed, but we have a real healthcare
crisis involving women and babies in
this country. In most of the world,
fewer and fewer women are dying from
childbirth—not here in the United
States. Our maternal mortality rate is
climbing. More women are dying. Our
infant mortality rate ranks a shameful
32 among the world’s 35 wealthiest na-
tions. That means we have more babies
who aren’t surviving through the first
year of their life because of lack of
healthcare, nutrition, and other issues.
The Republican majority should be
working with us and taking action to
improve health outcomes for moms and
babies. Instead, they are busy trying to
take away their healthcare.
Between 2010 and 2018, the Repub-
lican majority in Congress voted to re-
peal or weaken the Affordable Care Act
more than 70 times—7–0. Now the
Trump administration has stepped in
to help. Last June and August, they ex-
panded access to association health
plans and short-term plans. We just
call them junk plans because they
don’t cover so many basics, like pre-
scription drugs, mental health care,
and—you guessed it—maternity care.
Let me remind everyone that before
the Affordable Care Act, most insur-
ance companies did not cover prenatal
care and maternity care as a basic part
of healthcare. Women had to go out

and pay extra, get a rider to cover
something that is a basic part of our
healthcare.
Thanks to these junk plans that
don’t cover maternity care, and other
sabotage, it is estimated that right
now comprehensive health insurance
costs 16.6 percent more than it other-
wise would because of these efforts to
undermine, sabotage, and take away
healthcare. Does that sound like the
Republican majority cares about moms
and babies?
Now the Department of Justice has
announced that it agrees with the Fed-
eral judge in Texas who said the entire
Affordable Care Act must be struck
down. This is something the President
has enthusiastically embraced.
The entire Affordable Care Act is at
stake, including Medicaid expansion
for low-income workers who want to
work but now have to choose between
working and having healthcare cov-
erage, children staying on their par-
ents’ plans until age 26, and protec-
tions for people with preexisting condi-
tions.
In other words, if a baby is born with
spina bifida, a heart defect, a genetic
condition, or any other health problem,
insurance companies would once again,
under these plans, be able to deny them
coverage or subject them to lifetime
limits like we used to have. Does that
sound like policies that care about
moms and babies?
By the way, to emphasize that they
support President Trump 100 percent, 2
weeks ago Senate Republicans passed a
budget resolution out of committee on
a party-line vote that once again has
language to repeal the Affordable Care
Act with no replacement. Sorry, moms
and babies, you are on your own. And
don’t go looking to Medicaid for health
coverage either. The Trump budget
would cut $1.5 trillion from Medicaid
over 10 years—trillion. That is the
same Medicaid that covers half of all
babies born in America. When you gut
Medicaid, you are keeping moms and
babies from getting the healthcare
they need. Does that sound as though
Republicans care about moms and ba-
bies?
If our Republican colleagues really
care about the health of moms and ba-
bies, here is what they should be doing
and joining us to do: They would pass a
bill to guarantee that every insurance
plan covers prenatal and maternity
care, like what is available under the
Affordable Care Act. They would reaf-
firm the Affordable Care Act’s protec-
tions for people with preexisting condi-
tions, not just saying the words but ac-
tually making sure people with pre-
existing conditions are covered. And
they would strengthen healthcare for
moms and babies through the Chil-
dren’s Health Insurance Program and
Medicaid.
A few years ago, the Finance Com-
mittee reported out a bill that I led
with Senator GRASSLEY called the
Quality Care for Moms and Babies Act.
This bill would create a set of maternal
and infant quality care measures under
CHIP and Medicaid—the Children’s
Health Insurance Program and Med-
icaid. The goal is simple: improving
maternal and infant health outcomes.
We need quality standards across the
country.
Right now, half the births are
through Medicaid. There are not con-
sistent quality standards across the
country to make sure there are healthy
opportunities for prenatal care and ma-
ternity care.
The Quality Care for Moms and Ba-
bies Act would help make sure that
every mom gets the best pregnancy
care possible and every baby gets a
healthy start. If our Republican col-
leagues care so much about the health
of moms and babies, instead of politi-
cizing issues around reproductive
health and women’s ability to make
their own choices—instead of politi-
cizing what is happening around repro-
ductive health, they would join us in
making the Quality Care for Moms and
Baby Act a reality.
It is time to stop the cynical, polit-
ical stunts. It is time to trust women
to make the best reproductive
healthcare decisions for themselves,
their families, and their futures. It is
time to take action to resolve the ma-
ternal and infant health crisis in this
country. It is also time to ensure that
every mom and every baby has the
healthcare they need for a healthy life.
This is the United States of America;
we can do better for our moms and ba-
bies than is currently being done.
Democrats are ready to take real ac-
tion to join with our Republican col-
leagues. It is time they join us in pro-
tecting the health of moms and babies.

NOMINATION OF CHERYL MARIE STANTON
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I
come to the floor tonight to oppose the
nomination of Cheryl Stanton to serve
as Administrator of the Department of
Labor’s Wage and Hour Division.
The Wage and Hour Division enforces
some of our Nation’s most important
workplace laws, including the Federal
minimum wage, overtime pay, child
labor laws, and family and medical
leave. Yet, Ms. Stanton has a very long
history of siding with employers when
they have violated workers’ rights. So
I will be voting against this nomina-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to do
the same.
I also want to object to the Senate
moving on Republican labor nominees
without approving nominations for the
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission and the National Labor Rela-
tions Board.
Last Congress, in an unprecedented
display of obstruction, my colleagues
across the aisle blocked the confirma-
tion of Chai Feldblum and Mark Pearce
for terms on the EEOC and NLRB, re-
spectively.
Even though both of these nominees
were highly qualified, respected by
their peers, Senate Republicans refused
to give them a vote.
These are critical Agencies that are
responsible for protecting workers’
rights. Yet my colleagues across the
aisle were more interested in tilting
the playing field even more in favor of
corporations than providing the Com-
mission and the Board with balanced
voices.
Despite longstanding practice to con-
firm majority and minority members
to independent Agencies, my col-
leagues across the aisle jammed
through Republican nominees only to
the Board without Mr. Pearce, the
Democratic nominee.
Republican leaders allowed one Sen-
ator to block the nomination of Ms.
Feldblum to the EEOC, meaning that
important civil rights agency is unable
to do some of its most critical work.
In this moment, as our Nation is
grappling with how to address the epi-
demic of sexual assault and harassment
in the workplace, hamstringing the
Agency that is responsible for pro-
tecting women’s rights and safety is
absolutely the wrong message to send
to women, to workers, and to busi-
nesses.
So I am going to keep fighting to
make sure the nominees to the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board and the
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission represent all voices, as they
are supposed to, not just corporations.
I urge every man, woman, and work-
er who believes workers should have a
voice to join me in that.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
CHINA
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I
am on the Senate floor to talk about
the importance of trade and specifi-
cally our country’s economic relation-
ship with China.
As a trade lawyer, as a former U.S.
Trade Representative, as a member of
the Finance Committee now that han-
dles trade issues, I have been involved
in these issues over the years.
Most importantly, I am from Ohio,
which is a huge trade State. We are
concerned about trade because we have
a lot of manufacturing and a lot of ag-
riculture, where jobs depend on trade
back and forth. In fact, in Ohio, about
25 percent of our manufacturing work-
ers make products that get exported,
and one out of every three acres plant-
ed by Ohio farmers is now being ex-
ported.
These are good jobs. These are jobs
that pay, on average, about 16 percent
more than other jobs and have better
benefits. We want more of them.
With only 5 percent of the world’s
population and about 25 percent of the
world’s economy, America wants ac-
cess to the 95 percent of the consumers
living outside of our borders. It is al-
ways in our interest to open up over-
seas markets for our workers, our
farmers, and our service providers.
While promoting exports, we also
have to be sure we protect American
jobs from unfair trade, from imports
that would unfairly undercut our farm-
ers and our workers, our service pro-
viders. Simply put, we want a level
playing field, where there is fair and
reciprocal treatment. If it is fair, if we
have a level playing field, I believe
American workers and businesses can
compete and win.
The sweet spot for America is this
balanced approach: opening up new
markets for U.S. products, while being
tougher on trade enforcement so Amer-
ican workers have the opportunity to
compete.
In that context, I want to talk a lit-
tle about the inequities in our relation-
ship with China. We don’t have a level
playing field with China, and it is one
of the most important policy issues
that faces our country today.
It is certainly really important to
Ohio. Ohio sells a lot of products—auto
parts, aerospace parts, and other
things—to China. We also sell a lot of
oilseeds and grains, particularly soy-
beans—about $700 million worth every
year. China is actually our third big-
gest trading partner in Ohio after Can-
ada and Mexico.
Yet, despite these exports, we have a
trade deficit with China because they
send a lot more to us than we send to
them, and it is not always fair trade.
As an example, Ohio has been ground
zero for steel imports coming in be-
cause of government-directed over-
capacity in China. Our steel mills have
been hit hard because, to put it blunt-
ly, China has not been playing by the
rules.
In 2000, China produced about 15 per-
cent of the world’s steel. Today, thanks
to massive subsidies and other forms of
state intervention, they now produce
about 50 percent. So, again, about 19
years ago, they produced 15 percent of
the world’s steel; now they produce 50
percent of the world’s steel, and they
do it, again, through the government
subsidizing them.
They often sell that steel at below its
cost. They don’t need it in China so
they are trying to push it out to other
countries. They transship it to try to
avoid our anti-dumping duties or our
countervailing duties, which were put
in place because China wasn’t playing
by the rules. So we find out they are
selling below their cost, which is dump-
ing, or we find out they are subsidizing,
we win a trade case, but then China
sends that product to a third country
that then sends it to us, therefore,
evading the tariffs we put in place to
deal with the unfairness.
It hits our plants hard in Ohio, but it
also reduces the cost of steel around
the world.
When it comes to our bilateral eco-
nomic relationship, there is little or no
transparency from China when it
comes to their regulations, their ap-
provals for inbound foreign direct in-
vestment into China, and the required
notification of subsidies that is re-
quired by the World Trade Organiza-
tion.
This lack of transparency, of course,
frustrates American businesses, and it
violates China’s international obliga-
tions.
China also exhibits a lack of reci-
procity. Its market is substantially
more closed to American companies
than our market is to their companies.
We have Chinese companies in Ohio.
They don’t have to be in a joint ven-
ture with a 51-percent Ohio partner,
American partner; they can own the
whole thing. They don’t have to go
through this process of approvals that
American companies have to go
through, where often their intellectual
property is taken.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2318 April 9, 2019
China, as we all know, has relatively
higher tariffs than the United States—
on average, about a 10-percent tariff in
China versus our 3.4 percent tariff, but
that is not the biggest problem.
The biggest problem is a host of what
are called nontariff barriers. Some
keep out our ‘‘Made in America’’ prod-
ucts and others coerce the production
of those products to be in China. So if
you want to sell in China, you have to
produce in China, and that is in order
to transfer this valuable intellectual
property from U.S. companies to Chi-
nese companies.
Investment is not reciprocal either.
According to the U.S. Trade Represent-
ative in its section 301 report on China,
in 2016, the OECD—Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Develop-
ment—ranked China the fourth most
restrictive investment climate in the
world, despite their being the second
largest economy in the world.
So of all the countries in the world,
OECD ranked them the fourth most re-
strictive in terms of accepting foreign
investment.
Based on this report, China’s invest-
ment climate, then, is nearly four
times more restrictive than that of the
United States.
So the confluence of these two fac-
tors—the lack of transparency and rec-
iprocity—stem from China’s Com-
munist Party-led nonmarket economy.
While China made an effort after join-
ing the World Trade Organization to
become more market oriented, in re-
cent years, they have actually moved
away from more market-based reforms
and instead doubled down on the kind
of mercantilism you would expect in
the last century but revamped for the
21st century.
In doing so, China has placed enor-
mous strain on the world’s trading sys-
tem and, in turn, has undermined
American jobs, American workers, and
America’s overall competitiveness.
When I served as U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative, I said that the United
States-China trade relationship lacked
equity, durability, and balance. Sadly,
that is still the case today. We didn’t
have a level playing field then.
Since that time, the conduct has
even worsened. China has invested
large sums of money in industrial ca-
pacity, subsidizing production that im-
pacted industries in places like the
United States but also Japan, the Eu-
ropean Union, and many developing
countries.
China has embarked on a so-called
indigenous innovation campaign
backed by hundreds of billions of dol-
lars and the full weight of its nontrans-
parent regulatory apparatus. This in-
tent of the indigenous innovation cam-
paign seems to be directed primarily at
us but also other countries around the
world that are innovating.
The United States has been the lead-
er in many innovative technologies,
and now China is attempting to be the
leader. Think of artificial intelligence
or 5G.
China’s embrace of techno-nation-
alism has undercut critical commit-
ments it has made to open up its mar-
kets, protect intellectual property
rights, adhere to internationally recog-
nized labor rights, and meet its WTO
commitments on unfair trade prac-
tices, such as illegal subsidies.
Without changes to these practices,
as long as the inequities and imbal-
ances persist, the durability of our eco-
nomic relationship remains in ques-
tion.
I understand China is not going to
become a free market economy any-
time soon, and while I hope we can
have a more market-oriented economy
someday and we can move toward that
in China, as they were moving that
way after joining the WTO, I think it is
vital that we at least demand a level
playing field in the meantime.
That is why I have supported the
Trump administration’s efforts to de-
mand structural changes as part of its
ongoing negotiations with Beijing.
This takes the form of a few different
things. One is addressing our huge
trade deficit—that is part of the nego-
tiations—so China would buy more soy-
beans and might buy more LNG, lique-
fied natural gas. That is all good, but
this agreement must also deal with
these other issues, like forced tech-
nology transfers and dealing with non-
market practices, like state-owned en-
terprises and other subsidies.
Addressing the first issue by selling
additional soybeans and liquefied nat-
ural gas to China is a positive step for-
ward, but a short-term reduction of our
trade deficit, which is out of balance,
isn’t enough. We have to seek progress
on these sustainable structural
changes so we can count on a fair trad-
ing relationship between two now ma-
ture trading partners.
Ambassador Lighthizer, who is the
current U.S. Trade Representative, is a
tough negotiator. I feel confident that
he understands this, and he is going to
ensure that we not only improve the
imbalance in our trade deficit but
also—if we get these structural
changes we need—bring home a strong
and sustainable agreement.
That leads me to my next point. Any
agreement must not just address these
important structural problems, but it
also has to be enforceable. Without en-
forceability, it is going to be impos-
sible to make any real, meaningful
progress in our economic relationship
based on the past. We also have to do
more than merely enforce by negotia-
tion. I support consultations and con-
sistent engagement; that is also good.
But there also has to be some enforce-
ment mechanisms with some con-
sequences.
While I look forward to seeing the
agreement that we come up with
China—and I hope it happens soon—I
would like to offer a few suggestions
related to enforceability.
First, I favor reviving a China-spe-
cific safeguard to provide both due
process and an effective response to
surges with Chinese imports that in-
jure U.S. domestic industry, such as
the high-tech products or those derived
from nonmarket practices we talked
about earlier.
One model to consider is section 421
of the Trade Act of 1974. Now expired,
section 421 was a China-specific safe-
guard that was created, pursuant to
China’s WTO Accession Protocol, to
guard against increased imports from
China—surges—with less demanding re-
quirements than that afforded market
economies. I think it would be good to
get back to that.
Second, strong trade laws have been
successful in addressing some of the
externalities caused by China’s non-
market practices. We have to continue
to enforce those laws. Consider the 266-
percent tariff that is currently in place
with regard to imports of cold-rolled
steel from China. That was because we
brought a trade case, and we won the
trade case using internationally ac-
cepted criteria as to what constitutes
dumping and subsidies. Nonmarket
economy methodologies give our trade
remedy tools extra heft when deployed
against these unfair imports from
countries like China, which lack the
market-driven system found every-
where else in the world.
China knows the effectiveness of our
trade laws, especially the nonmarket
economy methodologies we use to get
that 266-percent tariff in place, and has
therefore challenged the use of these
methodologies. China has challenged
this at the World Trade Organization. I
hope that as part of any commitments
made pursuant to the current talks,
China will drop its challenge to the use
of nonmarket methodologies until such
time as China has actually become a
market economy under established and
accepted statutory criteria set out in
U.S. law.
Third, increased transparency re-
quirements can help make enforcement
more effective. As long as key ele-
ments of the ways that China inter-
venes in the economy—such as the pro-
vision of illegal subsidies; currency
manipulation, for that matter; the par-
ticipation in the market in state-
owned enterprises; and the application
of laws—remain without transparency,
it is going to be difficult to effectively
monitor compliance with commit-
ments that are made. We have to know.
We have the right to know. I thus urge
the administration to secure enforce-
able transparency commitments to en-
sure we have enough visibility on Chi-
na’s nonmarket practices to make en-
forcement as effective as possible.
I hope the administration takes some
of these enforcement suggestions into
account.
Today, pursuant to our section 301 in-
vestigation, the United States has lev-
ied tariffs of 25 percent on $50 billion
and 10 percent on $200 billion of exports
from China to the United States. These
tariffs are in place now, and they are
affecting a lot of our companies here in
the United States because China has,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2319

in turn, retaliated against us, putting
tariffs ranging from 5 to 25 percent on
$100 billion of U.S. exports to China. So
there has been an escalation of tariffs
as we have been in these negotiations.
There has been discussion about the
United States keeping our 25 percent
and 10 percent tariffs in place as a
backstop even after an agreement is
reached. I think that is unlikely be-
cause I think it is a recipe for no agree-
ment or an inadequate agreement.
Instead, I believe it is important for
both countries to reduce or eliminate
altogether the new tariffs under 301
and the retaliatory tariffs when the
agreement is reached. Of course, the
United States would be able to quickly
reimpose tariffs if China doesn’t live up
to the commitments it makes, and that
would be appropriate. But I think we
ought to make a commitment now to
China that we are willing to get rid of
these tariffs, or substantially all of
them, if a good agreement is reached.
Over the next few weeks, I hope the
President remains focused on reaching
this agreement that addresses the
structural inequities in our trade rela-
tionship. Buying more soybeans is im-
portant, but this is a chance to resolve
deeper issues, especially when there is
such compelling evidence of commit-
ments not met in the past and contin-
ued inequities in the U.S.-China trade
relationship.
As part of reaching an enforceable
structural agreement, I urge the ad-
ministration to give China certainty
about what we actually want and ex-
actly what we want. From what I have
heard, I believe giving Beijing the secu-
rity of an unwavering negotiating posi-
tion will help unlock China’s last best
offer. My sense is that is not yet on the
table because perhaps they think we
have shifted in terms of our objectives
and priorities. The agreement would
then allow the United States to take a
step forward toward a more balanced,
equitable, and durable U.S.-China rela-
tionship.
Again, I commend the administration
and President Trump and Ambassador
Lighthizer for engaging in these nego-
tiations. I think we are headed in the
right direction, but let’s bring it to a
close.
I want to note that the current nego-
tiations are only part of what must be
a holistic and long-term strategy to-
ward China. A good agreement and
strong enforcement is essential, but to
keep the United States competitive
over the long term, we have to invest
more here at home.
As an example, if you are going to be
in a sports competition, it helps to go
to the gym once in a while. Until re-
cently, we hadn’t been hitting the gym
too much.
Tax reform and lifting burdensome
regulations recently have given our
economy a shot in the arm. It is really
important because it has created jobs
and increased wages, but it has also
made our country more competitive,
particularly by investing in technology
and investing in new equipment.
Unfortunately, we still have some
challenges we need to address to be
truly competitive. We have a work-
force that too often lacks the skills
necessary for the 21st century. We have
an opioid epidemic that is undermining
our economy as well as our commu-
nities. We have a crumbling infrastruc-
ture that is holding back economic
growth.
Instead of people being awed at how
quickly China can build a bridge, I
want people to be awed at how effec-
tively and how fast we can build a
bridge here in this country. To do that,
we need to build on the permitting re-
forms we have enacted in the last few
years to make it easier to start and
quicker to finish projects that keep our
economy moving and growing. Rein-
vesting in America with world-class ca-
reer and technical education, infra-
structure investment, pro-growth and
pro-innovation economic policies, as
we started with tax reform and regu-
latory relief—these are the things that
would send signals to China and to the
rest of the world that we are a vibrant
nation, we are in the game, we are fo-
cused on the future, we are constantly
innovating, and we are not a nation in
decline.
I believe the best days of our country
can be before us. We need to show the
world that America remains, in fact,
the world’s preeminent power because
of our free markets, because of our in-
novations, and because of our work
ethic. If we do that, we will be able to
compete with China. If we don’t, even
without these trade negotiations, it
will be difficult.
By the way, unlike some, I don’t pro-
pose to compete with China by adopt-
ing policies and processes that mimic
their system. As an example, national-
izing our 5G deployment or adopting 5-
year industrial plans, as China does, is
not the path to success. It gives in to
the critiques that we make of Beijing.
Instead, we need to double down on the
American way: big ideas and bold vi-
sions grounded in principles unique to
our origins. After all, we believe in
freedom and free markets because they
work.
With regard to China, we should want
to have a successful and mutually ben-
eficial relationship on trade and other
issues. China and the United States
must be strategic competitors going
forward, not enemies.
I commend the Trump administra-
tion for entering into these difficult
and very important negotiations with
China, and I encourage the administra-
tion to stay strong in the pursuit of
long-term, meaningful structural
changes in that relationship. I want
our country to do the hard work here
at home, to ensure that American com-
petitiveness is second to none. That
combination—a successful resolution
of longstanding issues with China and
staying on the cutting edge here at
home—will ensure the continued pros-
perity and global leadership of the
United States of America.
Thank you.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Japan—Standard Missile (SM)–3 Block IB
The Government of Japan has requested to
buy up to fifty-six (56) Standard Missile–3
(SM–3) Block IB missiles. Also included are
missile canisters, U.S. Government and con-
tractor representatives’ technical assistance,
engineering and logistical support services,
and other related elements of logistics and
program support. The estimated cost is $1.150
billion.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by improving the security of a major
ally that is a force for political stability and
economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region.
It is vital to U.S. national interests to assist
Japan in developing and maintaining a
strong and effective self-defense capability.
The proposed sale will provide Japan with
increased ballistic missile defense capability
to assist in defending the Japanese homeland
and U.S. personnel stationed there. Japan
will have no difficulty absorbing these addi-
tional missiles into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The prime contractor for the SM–3 Block
IB All Up Rounds will be Raytheon Missile
Systems, Tucson, Arizona. The prime con-
tractor for the canisters will be BAE Sys-
tems, Minneapolis, Minnesota. There are no
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require annual trips to Japan involving U.S.
Government and contractor representatives
for technical reviews, support, and oversight
for approximately five years.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.
TRANSMITTAL NO. 19–13
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the
Arms Export Control Act
Annex Item No. vii
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The proposed sale will involve the re-
lease of sensitive technology to the Govern-
ment of Japan related to the Standard Mis-
sile–3 (SM–3):
The Block IB is an iteration of the SM–3
family. It has distinct features over the older
Block IA variant previously sold to Japan in-
cluding an enhanced warhead which im-
proves the search, discrimination, acquisi-
tion and tracking functions in order to ad-
dress emerging threats. Once enclosed in the
canister, the SM–3 Block IB missile is classi-
fied CONFIDENTIAL.
2. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system
effectiveness or be used in the development
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities.
3. A determination has been made that
Japan can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification.
4. All defense articles and services listed in
this transmittal are authorized for release
and export to the Government of Japan.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY FISCAL
YEAR 2020 BUDGET REQUEST
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that a copy of
my opening statement at the Sub-
committee on Energy and Water Devel-
opment’s budget hearing for the De-
partment of Energy’s fiscal year 2020
budget request be printed in the
RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY FISCAL YEAR 2020
BUDGET REQUEST
Mr. ALEXANDER. The Subcommittee on
Energy and Water Development will please
come to order.
Today’s hearing will review the adminis-
tration’s fiscal year 2020 budget request for
the Department of Energy.
This is the Subcommittee’s first budget
hearing this year.
We will have three additional hearings
with the National Nuclear Security Adminis-
tration, the Corps of Engineers and Bureau
of Reclamation, and the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission over the next five weeks. Sen-
ator Feinstein and I will each have an open-
ing statement.
I will then recognize each Senator for up to
five minutes for an opening statement, alter-
nating between the majority and minority,
in the order in which they arrived.
We will then turn to Secretary Perry for
his testimony on behalf of the Department of
Energy.
At the conclusion of Secretary Perry’s tes-
timony, I will then recognize Senators for
five minutes of questions each, alternating
between the majority and minority in the
order in which they arrived. Earlier this
week I proposed a New Manhattan Project
for Clean Energy, a five year project with
Ten Grand Challenges that will use Amer-
ican research and technology to put our
country and the world firmly on a path to-
ward clean, cheaper energy.
Meeting these Grand Challenges would cre-
ate breakthroughs in advanced nuclear reac-
tors, natural gas, carbon capture, better bat-
teries, greener buildings, electric vehicles,
cheaper solar and fusion. To provide the
tools to create these breakthroughs, the fed-
eral government should double its funding
for energy research and keep the United
States number one in the world in advanced
computing. This strategy takes advantage of
the United States’ secret weapon, our ex-
traordinary capacity for basic research espe-
cially at our 17 national laboratories. It will
strengthen our economy and raise our family
incomes.
As we review the Department of Energy’s
fiscal year 2020 budget request today and
work on drafting the Energy and Water De-
velopment Appropriations bill, I will be
keeping these Ten Grand Challenges in mind.
I would like to thank Secretary Perry for
being here today. This is Secretary Perry’s
third year to testify before the sub-
committee.
I also want to thank Senator Feinstein,
with whom I have the pleasure to work with
again this year to draft the Energy and
Water Development Appropriations bill. Our
subcommittee has a good record of being the
first of appropriations bills to be considered
by the Committee and by the Senate each
year. For each of the past four years, Sen-
ator Feinstein and I have been able to have
our bill signed into law.
Last year, we worked together in a bipar-
tisan way on the fiscal year 2019 Energy and
Water Development Appropriations bill that
was signed into law before the start of the
fiscal year—the first time that happened
since 2000.
We provided $6.585 billion for the Depart-
ment’s Office of Science, the fourth consecu-
tive year of record level funding, which sup-
ports basic science and energy research at
our 17 national laboratories and is the na-
tion’s largest supporter of research in the
physical sciences.
The bill also provided $366 million for
ARPA–E, to continue the important research
and development investments into high-im-
pact energy technologies—another record
funding level in a regular appropriations bill.
We also provided $1.3 billion for Depart-
ment’s Office of Nuclear Energy, which is re-
sponsible for research and development of
advanced reactors and small modular reac-
tors. Finally, the bill we passed last year
provided $15.2 billion for the National Nu-
clear Security Administration, including
record funding levels for our Weapons Pro-
gram and Naval Reactors.
This year, the Department of Energy’s
budget request is about $3.9 billion below
what Congress provided last year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2321
April 9, 2019
I’m pleased that the Department’s budget
request prioritizes supercomputing, and in-
cludes approximately $809 million to deploy
exascale systems in the early 2020’s.
Unfortunately, the budget request this
year again proposes to decrease spending on
federally funded research and development,
terminates ARPA–E and the loan guarantee
programs, and cuts other funding, specifi-
cally:
The Office of Science by $1 billion;
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
by $2 billion;
Nuclear Energy by $502 million; and
Fossil Energy by $178 million.
And that is why we are holding this hear-
ing: to give Secretary Perry an opportunity
to discuss the Department’s priorities, so
Senator Feinstein and I can make informed
decisions as we begin to write the fiscal year
2020 Energy and Water Development Appro-
priations bill over the next few weeks. Gov-
erning is about setting priorities, and we al-
ways have to make some hard decisions to
ensure the highest priorities are funded.
Today, I’d like to focus my questions on
five main areas, all with an eye toward set-
ting priorities: Prioritizing federal support
for science and energy research; Maintaining
a safe and effective nuclear weapons stock-
pile; Demonstrating that we can build safe,
affordable advanced reactors; Keeping Amer-
ica first in supercomputing; and Solving the
nuclear waste stalemate. The Department of
Energy’s research programs have made the
United States a world leader in science and
technology, and these programs will help the
United States maintain its brainpower ad-
vantage to remain competitive at a time
when other countries are investing heavily
in research.
DEMONSTRATING THAT WE CAN BUILD SAFE,
AFFORDABLE ADVANCED REACTORS
Today, nuclear power accounts for 60% of
our carbon-free electricity and, if we are
going to slow the effects of climate change,
nuclear power will be necessary into the fu-
ture. However, the cost to build and operate
today’s large nuclear reactors is too high. If
we don’t do something soon, nuclear power
will not have a future in the United States.
Advanced reactors have the potential to be
smaller, cheaper, less wasteful, and safer
than today’s reactors.
To demonstrate their potential, we need to
build some of these advanced reactors, en-
able them to get licensed, and make sure
they are available to replace the existing re-
actors when they come offline. Secretary
Perry, I’d like to hear your views on this, in-
cluding whether you think it would be help-
ful for the Department of Energy, working
with the private sector and the National
Laboratories, to manage a program that
would build and demonstrate current ad-
vanced reactor technologies.
MAINTAINING A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE NUCLEAR
WEAPONS STOCKPILE
A key pillar of our national defense is a
strong nuclear deterrent. Last February, the
administration issued an updated nuclear
policy, called the Nuclear Posture Review.
The updated Nuclear Posture Review rec-
ommends continuing many of the things
Congress has been working on for the last
several years—things that I support, includ-
ing: continuing Life Extension Programs to
make sure our current nuclear weapons re-
main safe and effective; and continuing to
invest in the facilities we need to maintain
our nuclear weapons stockpile. This includes
the Uranium Processing Facility, the Pluto-
nium Facility, and the facilities to process
lithium and tritium.
I’m pleased to know the Department con-
tinues to make progress on construction of
the nuclear buildings for the Uranium Proc-
essing Facility, and I’ll be asking some ques-
tions about that project today. The Nuclear
Posture Review also calls for two low yield
warheads to be added to the stockpile, large-
ly in response to capabilities being developed
by Russia and other countries, and I know
the Department is working on this impor-
tant issue.
I’d like to hear more about that today, and
look forward to hearing about the progress
being made on the Uranium Processing Fa-
cility.
China, Japan, the U.S. and the European
Union all want to be first in supercomputing.
The stakes are high because the winner has
an advantage in advanced manufacturing,
simulating advanced reactors and weapons
before they are built, finding terrorists and
saving billions of Medicaid waste, and simu-
lating the electric grid in a natural disaster,
and other progress.
The U.S. regained the number one spot last
year, thanks to sustained funding by Con-
gress during both the Obama and Trump ad-
ministrations. I am pleased that this budget
request proposes to continue development of
exascale supercomputers—the next genera-
tion of supercomputers that will develop a
system a thousand times faster than the
first supercomputer the U.S. built in 2008.
To ensure that nuclear power has a strong
future in this country, we must solve the
decades’ long stalemate over what to do with
used fuel from our nuclear reactors. Senator
Feinstein and I have been working on this
problem for years, and I’d like to take the
opportunity to compliment Senator Fein-
stein on her leadership and her insistence
that we find a solution to this problem. To
solve the stalemate, we need to find places to
build geologic repositories and temporary
storage facilities so the federal government
can finally meet its legal obligation to dis-
pose of nuclear waste safely and perma-
nently.
This year’s budget request for the Depart-
ment of Energy includes $110 million to re-
start work for Yucca Mountain repository
and $6.5 million to study ways to open an in-
terim storage site or use a private interim
storage site. I strongly believe that Yucca
Mountain can and should be part of the solu-
tion to the nuclear waste stalemate. Federal
law designates Yucca Mountain as the na-
tion’s repository for used nuclear fuel, and
the Commission’s own scientists have told us
that we can safely store nuclear waste there
for up to one million years.
But even if we had Yucca Mountain open
today, we would still need to look for an-
other permanent repository. We have more
than enough used fuel to fill Yucca Mountain
to its legal capacity. So Senator Feinstein
and I, working with the leaders of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Resources,
Senator Murkowski and then Senators
Bingaman, Wyden, Cantwell, and now Sen-
ator Manchin, have a bill to implement the
recommendations of the President’s Blue
Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear
Future, which we’re working to reintroduce
this year.
The legislation complements Yucca Moun-
tain, and would create a new federal agency
to find additional permanent repositories
and temporary facilities for used nuclear
fuel. But the quickest, and probably the
least expensive, way for the federal govern-
ment to start to meet its used nuclear fuel
obligations is for the Department of Energy
to contract with a private storage facility
for used nuclear fuel.
Two years ago, you told this subcommittee
that the Department of Energy has the au-
thority to take title to used nuclear fuel, but
you were hesitant to agree that it has the
authority to store the used fuel at a private
facility without more direction from Con-
gress. I understand that two private compa-
nies have submitted license applications to
the NRC for private consolidated storage fa-
cilities, one in Texas and one in New Mexico,
and that the NRC’s review is well underway.
I look forward to working with Secretary
Perry as we begin putting together our En-
ergy and Water Development Appropriations
bill for fiscal year 2020 and hearing what Sec-
retary Perry’s priorities are. I also expect
that the Department will continue to fund
projects consistent with Congressional in-
tent in the fiscal year 2019 Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act.
I will now recognize Senator Feinstein for
her opening statement.
f
TRIBUTE TO DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
nearly two years ago, just before the
Senate voted to confirm Dr. Gottlieb to
lead the Food and Drug Administra-
tion, FDA, I said that he was ‘‘the
right person to lead the FDA in [its]
vital mission and move the agency for-
ward so that America’s patients can
benefit from the remarkable discov-
eries . . . that our nation’s researchers
are working on.’’
Since then, Dr. Gottlieb’s leadership
at FDA has proved that prediction cor-
rect.
Dr. Gottlieb has been one of the
President’s best appointments.
Two years ago, I also said that
‘‘there’s never been a more important
time to capitalize on the significant
funding Congress has given to medical
research.’’
Congress has given the National In-
stitutes of Health, NIH, a $9 billion in-
crease from 2015–2019, almost $40 billion
dollars in 2019, and FDA plays a key
role in bringing new treatments and
cures to American patients.
In 2016, Congress passed what Leader
MCCONNELL called the most important
legislation of the Congress, the 21st
Century Cures Act, to help speed the
development of new drugs and devices.
This exciting time in medicine also
brings great promise to patients to
lower the cost of medicine, as more
promising treatments come to market,
we see increased competition, which
helps to drive down how much patients
pay for medicines they need.
Dr. Gottlieb’s successful tenure at
the agency includes helping to bring
more competition to the market. In
2018, FDA approved or tentatively ap-
proved over 1,000 generic drugs, ap-
proved 34 novel orphan drugs, which
are drugs to treat rare diseases, and
designated 18 regenerative medicines
as regenerative medicine advanced
therapies, so they can be reviewed fast-
er.
Here are just a few other important
things Dr. Gottlieb has accomplished:
When Dr. Gottlieb took over at FDA,
Congress was working to reauthorize
the four medical product user fee
agreements that make up about a third
of FDA’s funding.
In addition to reauthorizing the four
user fee agreements, Congress worked
with Dr. Gottlieb and authorized an ex-
pedited approval process for generic

drugs where there is little or no mar-
ket competition, called the Competi-
tive Generic Therapies pathway, as
part of the FDA Reauthorization Act of
2017.
Since August 2018, FDA has approved
five new generic drugs under this path-
way and has designated over 140 ge-
neric drug applications as qualifying
for this pathway.
Dr. Gottlieb also announced a new
plan, called the Biosimilar Action
Plan, to bring generic versions of bio-
logic drugs, called biosimilars, to help
improve competition for biologics by
increasing market entry of biosimilars
and providing more treatment options
for patients.
FDA has approved a total of 18 bio-
similar products since 2010, when the
biosimilar pathway was created, 13 of
which were approved under Dr. Gott-
lieb’s watch.
At his confirmation hearing, Dr.
Gottlieb described the opioid crisis as
‘‘having staggering human con-
sequences. I think it’s the biggest cri-
sis facing the agency. . . . I think it’s
going to require an all-of-the-above ap-
proach . . .’’
Last year, 72 senators worked on leg-
islation to combat the opioid crisis.
Dr. Gottlieb provided us with crucial
advice as we worked on this legislation
and has begun to take advantage of the
new law.
He has taken steps to help prevent il-
licit fentanyl, which is 100 times more
powerful than heroin, from coming
across the border.
He worked with Congress to clarify
his authority to require opioids to be
packaged in blister packs, such as a 3
or 7-day supply, to encourage doctors
to prescribe responsibly; and clarified
FDA’s authority to require safe dis-
posal options to accompany opioid
packaging.
Dr. Collins, who leads the NIH, has
predicted a nonaddictive opioid in the
next decade, which really is the Holy
Grail for fighting the opioid crisis and
for helping the 50–100 million Ameri-
cans living with pain.
I believe Dr. Gottlieb has laid
groundwork to encourage the develop-
ment of nonaddictive and nonopioid
medicines and therapies to treat pain.
Dr. Gottlieb was integral to
Congress’s ability to reauthorize the
animal drug user fees, which authorize
the FDA to collect user fees to speed
the review and approval of new drugs
that farmers, families, and veterinar-
ians rely on to keep their animals
healthy and the food supply safe.
The 21st Century Cures Act created
the Regenerative Medicine Advanced
Therapy Designation, which is similar
to the very successful breakthrough
drug pathway that safely shortened the
development and review time for cer-
tain drugs, to get them to patients who
need them more quickly.
While we worked on that law, I heard
the story of Nashville resident Doug
Oliver.
In 2007, Doug began to have trouble
seeing and, after a near accident, had
his driver’s license taken away and was
declared legally blind.
The culprit was a rare form of
macular degeneration.
His doctor at the Vanderbilt Eye In-
stitute told him that while there were
no cures, Doug could search online for
a clinical trial.
Doug found a regenerative medicine
clinical trial in Florida, where doctors
took cells out of the bone marrow in
his hip, spun them in a centrifuge, and
then injected those into his eye.
Three days later, he began to see.
His eyesight eventually improved
enough to get his driver’s license back,
and he became an effective advocate
for more support for regenerative med-
icine, which we included in the 21st
Century Cures Act.
So, with his improved vision, he
began writing letters and visiting me
to advocate for more support for regen-
erative medicine, which we did in the
21st Century Cures Act.
Two years ago, Doug gave me the
cane he had used while he was blind. He
said: ‘‘I don’t need it anymore.’’
In Cures, we included a pathway to
bring new regenerative medicine treat-
ments, similar to the treatment Doug
received, to patients more quickly.
Dr. Gottlieb has worked to imple-
ment that new pathway to help develop
safe treatments to ensure more pa-
tients are able to take advantage of
this cutting-edge, personalized medical
technology.
Additionally, Dr. Gottlieb has helped
the agency develop and advance guid-
ances for gene therapies that will help
new innovative companies developing
these promising therapies, some of
which may be for specific diseases and
conditions that provide roadmaps for
biotechnology companies who are lead-
ing the way in precision medicine.
During this exciting time in bio-
medical research, we are fortunate that
Dr. Gottlieb was willing to serve.
The FDA and the biomedical commu-
nity is in better shape today to ad-
vance medical innovation and develop
the treatments and cures of the future
because of his leadership.
f
CELEBRATING ROMANI AMERICAN
HERITAGE
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President,
today I rise to celebrate International
Roma Day, which occurred yesterday,
April 8, 2019. Last week, Senator
WICKER, the Helsinki Commission’s
Senate cochairman, and I introduced a
resolution that celebrates Romani
American heritage.
As a member of the U.S. Helsinki
Commission and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly Spe-
cial Representative on Anti-Semitism,
Racism & Intolerance, I have long
worked to improve the situation of
Roma throughout the OSCE region.
The resolution we introduced on
April 4 does four things.
First, it recognizes and celebrates
Romani American heritage. Roma have
come to the United States with every
wave of European migration since the
colonial period. In the United
States,there may be as many as 1 mil-
lion Americans with some Romani an-
cestry, whether distant or more recent.
Romani people have made distinct and
important contributions in many
fields, including agriculture, art,
crafts, literature, medicine, military
service, music, sports, and science.
Second, it supports International
Roma Day and the Department of
State’s robust engagement in activities
to honor that occasion. On April 8, 1971,
the First World Romani Congress met
in London, bringing together Roma
from across Europe and the United
States with the goal of promoting
transnational cooperation among
Roma, combating social
marginalization, and building a posi-
tive future for Roma everywhere. April
8 is now celebrated as International
Roma Day around the world. U.S. Am-
bassadors and our Embassies across
Europe are frequently asked to partici-
pate in April 8 celebrations across the
region. I commend the important work
they are doing as they demonstrate
U.S. commitment to inclusive societies
not only on April 8 but throughout the
entire year.
Third, this resolution commemorates
the 75th anniversary of the destruction
of the so-called Gypsy Family Camp at
Auschwitz. Experts estimate that
200,000 to 500,000 Romani people were
killed in death camps and elsewhere
throughout Europe. On August 2 to 3,
1944, Nazis murdered between 4,200 and
4,300 Romani men, women, and children
in gas chambers when the Nazis de-
cided to liquidate this camp. A number
of governments have taken important
steps in recent years to commemorate
the genocide of Roma, to remember the
victims, and educate future genera-
tions. Germany took an important step
when it opened a memorial in Berlin
for Sinti and Roma victims of national
socialism. I also commend the Czech
Government for its decision to remove
the pig farm at the site of the Lety
concentration camp and address re-
maining issues regarding the proper
memorialization of that sensitive site.
Finally, this resolution commends
the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum
for its critically important role in pro-
moting remembrance of the Holocaust
and educating audiences about the
genocide of Roma. The U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum is the preeminent
Federal institution dedicated to serv-
ing as a living memorial to the Holo-
caust. I am honored to serve as a mem-
ber of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum Council and I welcome the ini-
tiatives of the museum to ensure that
Romani victims are remembered and
support related scholarship.
I am pleased that Senator WICKER
has joined me in introducing this reso-
lution and urge other colleagues to join
us in celebrating Romani-American
heritage.

April 9, 2019
TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT
COMMANDER STEVEN DAVIES
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I am pleased to commend LCDR
Steven Davies for his dedication to
duty and service as a U.S. Coast Guard
congressional fellow on my staff. Steve
was recently selected to serve as execu-
tive officer of USCGC Thetis and will
soon depart to fulfill that important
responsibility.
A native of Lebanon, PA, Steve was
commissioned after his graduation
from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy,
where he earned a bachelor of science
degree in management, served as vice
president of his class, and captained
the men’s soccer team. He is in the
process of earning a master’s degree.
Steve has served in a broad range of
assignments during his Coast Guard ca-
reer. He has served overseas in Kuwait
and deployed with Patrol Forces
Southwest Asia in support of Oper-
ations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom,
conducted national security missions
on five ships in the Arabian Gulf. In ad-
dition to deployments overseas, he has
served in vital roles in support of U.S.
security interests. As commanding offi-
cer of USCGC Sailfish, he led search and
rescue operations and various law en-
forcement missions in the Port of New
York and New Jersey. As Commanding
Officer of USCGC Kathleen Moore,
Steve led a 26-person crew that inter-
dicted $18 million of cocaine and nearly
700 undocumented migrants attempting
to reach the United States.
Most recently, Steve served as the
congressional fellow on my staff and,
prior to that, for the Honorable Sen-
ator Thad Cochran of Mississippi.
Steve’s operational experience in the
Gulf of Mexico, Southwest Asia, and
the Arabian Gulf, in addition to his
technical expertise in counterdrug and
migrant interdictions, search and res-
cue operations, and law enforcement
missions, have been pivotal in helping
to shape Department of Homeland Se-
curity and U.S. Coast Guard appropria-
tions for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.
As a congressional fellow, he has
served the State of Mississippi, the
Coast Guard, and our Nation admi-
rably. My staff and I have enjoyed the
benefit of Steve’s counsel and have
truly enjoyed working with him.
Steve’s leadership has brought great
credit to the Coast Guard, and I appre-
ciate and commend his commitment to
continue to serve our nation.
It is a pleasure to recognize and
thank LCDR Steve Davies for his serv-
ice to this country. My staff and I ex-
tend our gratitude to Steve and wish
him ‘‘Fair winds and following seas’’ as
he continues his journey in the U.S.
Coast Guard.

Associate Laboratory Director from Oak
Ridge National Laboratory); and Admiral
Frank Caldwell, Deputy Administrator for
Naval Reactors.
Our subcommittee has a good record of
being the first of the appropriations bills to
be considered by the Committee and by the
Senate each year. For each of the past four
years, Senator Feinstein and I have been
able to have our bill signed into law.
Last year, we worked together in a bipar-
tisan way on the fiscal year 2019 Energy and
Water Development Appropriations bill that
was signed into law before the start of the
fiscal year—the first time that happened
since 2000.
In last year’s appropriations bill we pro-
vided $15.2 billion for the National Nuclear
Security Administration, including $1.9 bil-
lion for the six life extension programs,
which fix or replace components in weapons
systems to make sure they’re safe and reli-
able.
We also funded the Uranium Processing
Facility at the Y–12 National Security Com-
plex at $703 million, which will continue to
keep this project on time and on budget,
with a completion year of 2025 at a cost no
greater than $6.5 billion.
I look forward to working with Senator
Feinstein on another strong bill this year.
We’re here today to review the administra-
tion’s fiscal year 2020 budget request for the
National Nuclear Security Administration
(NNSA), the semi-autonomous agency within
the Department of Energy that is responsible
for a vital mission—maintaining our nuclear
weapons stockpile, reducing the global dan-
gers posed by weapons of mass destruction,
and providing the Navy with safe and effec-
tive nuclear power.
The president’s fiscal year 2020 budget re-
quest for the NNSA is $16.5 billion, an in-
crease of $1.3 billion (or 8 percent) over last
year (the fiscal year 2019 enacted level).
Today, I’d like to focus my remarks and
questions on three main areas:
1. Effectively maintaining our nuclear
weapons stockpile;
2. Keeping critical projects on time and on
budget; and
3. Supporting our nuclear Navy.
When the Senate agreed to ratify the New
Start Treaty in December 2010, we also
agreed to support funding to modernize and
maintain our nuclear weapons stockpile,
plus the facilities to do the work. A vital
part of NNSA’s mission is completion of the
five ongoing life extension programs, which
fix or replace components in weapons sys-
tems to make sure they’re safe and reliable.
The budget request includes $2.1 billion to
continue the life extension programs. I want
to make sure we are spending taxpayer dol-
lars effectively.
Completing all of the work that needs to
be done for these weapons systems will re-
sult in a higher workload than the weapons
program has had in any time since the
height of the Cold War, and it will require a
large number of highly-trained experts at
the production sites, like Y–12 in Oak Ridge
Tennessee, the weapons laboratories, and the
federal employees that work for NNSA. I’d
like to hear more today about whether
NNSA has enough qualified people to do this
work. I would also like to discuss today
whether NNSA will be able to keep the life
extension programs on time and on budget.
The NNSA is responsible for some of the
largest construction projects in the federal
government. Senator Feinstein and I have
worked hard to keep costs from sky-
rocketing. We want to make sure hard-
earned taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and
that these projects are on time and on budg-
et.
First we focused on our oversight on the
Uranium Processing Facility in Tennessee.
We held routine meetings with the Depart-
ment’s leadership to discuss the project—
particularly how the Department imple-
mented the recommendations of a Red Team
review, completed in 2014, to get the project
on track.
After completing more than 90% of the de-
sign for the nuclear facilities, NNSA began
construction of the Uranium Processing Fa-
cility last year. I’d like to hear more about
the progress on construction from the wit-
nesses today.
Senator Feinstein and I also worked with
the Department on ways to get excess pluto-
nium out of South Carolina more quickly
and for less cost. Last year, Secretary Perry
canceled the MOX project in favor of the Di-
lute and Disposal alternative, which the De-
partment of Energy estimated will save tax-
payers more than $20 billion. I’d like to hear
more today on the progress NNSA is making
at removing the plutonium from South Caro-
lina.
Lastly, the NNSA is restarting our ability
to make plutonium pits for the stockpile.
The budget request includes $712 million for
plutonium sustainment, which is 97% more
than the current funding level. This difficult,
but important work, will be done in New
Mexico and South Carolina. The NNSA has

decided to use existing facilities and exper-
tise in New Mexico to make some pits, and
repurpose the MOX facility in South Caro-
lina to make the remainder. That’s a good
plan and I support it. I want to hear from
Administrator Gordon-Hagerty today how
NNSA is applying the lessons we learned
from UPF and MOX to make sure we get the
pit production restart done on time and on
budget.
Naval Reactors is responsible for all as-
pects of nuclear power for our submarines
and aircraft carriers. Naval Reactors has a
lot on their plate right now—they are de-
signing a new reactor core for the next class
of submarines, refueling a prototype reactor,
and building a new spent fuel processing fa-
cility for nuclear waste from defense activi-
ties.
Admiral Caldwell and I had an opportunity
talk about the new spent fuel processing fa-
cility earlier this week. It is a part of the
Navy’s consolidated interim storage for its
used nuclear fuel.
The Navy’s program shows that it can be
done safely and effectively, but that does not
replace the need for a permanent repository
at Yucca Mountain. That used nuclear fuel
will still need to go to Yucca Mountain once
it is built. I look forward to Admiral
Caldwell’s comments today on the progress
he’s making on his important work, and par-
ticularly how Naval Reactors stores used nu-
clear fuel. I’d also like to hear what is being
done to keep the new Columbia-Class sub-
marine design on track.
The NNSA needs to complete a lot of im-
portant work, and this work is going to re-
quire good planning and effective oversight.
I look forward to working with Adminis-
trator Gordon-Hagerty as we begin putting
together our Energy and Water Appropria-
tions bill for fiscal year 2020, and also with
Senator Feinstein, who I will now recognize
for her opening statement.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
RECOGNIZING THE BIG CHEESE OF
MIAMI
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as
chairman of the Senate Committee on
Small Business and Entrepreneurship,
it is my privilege to recognize a small
business that exemplifies creativity,
hard work, and dedication to improv-
ing their community. This week, it is
my honor to name The Big Cheese of
Miami, FL, as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week.
Having just celebrated their 35 year
anniversary, The Big Cheese has grown
from a 12-seat and 2-person operation
to a landmark Miami Italian res-
taurant. Lifelong friends Bill Archer
and Garry Duell founded The Big
Cheese in 1984 and due to their rapid
success, expanded to a larger location
across the street. Bill is the culinary
expert of the duo and has developed
original recipes for all 120 items on the
menu, while Garry focuses on the day-
to-day operations. Along the way, they
have shared in the restaurant’s suc-
cess.
Today, The Big Cheese remains fam-
ily-oriented and affordable and uses
only the finest ingredients. They have
an extensive menu that includes every-
thing from Italian favorites to Miami
classics. Many of their employees have
been there since inception, and others
are second-generation employees, with
an average employee tenure of 16 years.
Bill, Gary, and longtime manager
Salvatore Aiello strive to create a wel-
coming and friendly atmosphere and
they have certainly succeeded.
Their dedication to fair prices and
made-from-scratch dishes has not gone
unnoticed. They were voted The Best
Inexpensive Italian Restaurant in
Miami and received the 5 Kids Crown
Award from South Florida Parenting
Magazine for their pizza. They are
proud to feed people from diverse socio-
economic and cultural backgrounds
and remain focused on serving their
community.
One example of their efforts to help
community members in need was dur-
ing Hurricane Irma recovery, when
they donated food to the emergency op-
erations center in Monroe County.
They are also the official sponsor of
the University of Miami Athletics De-
partment, providing both the Hurri-
canes and their competitors with
pregame meals. Since their founding,
they have served thousands of Univer-
sity of Miami students and collected
more than 200 pieces of original memo-
rabilia. Their dedication to the school
was recently honored when they were
chosen to represent the University of
Miami during the Taste of the NFL, a
charity aimed at bringing awareness to
the millions of Americans who struggle
with hunger.
The Big Cheese is an exemplary com-
munity-focused small business. They
have remained true to their original
values and serve their community in
times of need. Like many Main Street
restaurants throughout our country,
The Big Cheese is a place where com-
munity members have gathered and en-
joyed meals together for decades. By
focusing on quality food and superior
customer service, The Big Cheese has
stayed in high demand. It is with great
pleasure that I extend my congratula-
tions to Bill, Gary and all of the em-
ployees at The Big Cheese. I wish you
well as you continue serving the people
of South Florida, and I look forward to
watching your continued growth and
success.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. KAINE:
S. 1070. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services
to fund demonstration projects to im-
prove recruitment and retention of
child welfare workers; to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, investing
in the development of a robust, well-
trained, and stable child welfare work-
force is central to improving outcomes
for children and families across the
United States. The existence of such a
workforce is essential to a child wel-
fare agency’s ability to carry out the
responsibilities with which they have
been entrusted. Child welfare work has
been shown to be physically and emo-
tionally challenging, as demonstrated
by recent studies into the impact of
secondary traumatic stress (STS) on
child welfare professionals. The mul-
titude of challenges inherent in child
welfare work, combined with relatively
low compensation and work benefits,
make these careers difficult to sustain,
resulting in high rates of turnover.
Studies conducted over the last 15
years estimate the national rate of
turnover of child welfare workers to be
20–40 percent annually. In 2017, Vir-
ginia reported a turnover rate of 30%,
while Washington State reported a
turnover rate of 20% and Georgia re-
ported a turnover rate of 32%. These
high rates of turnover detract from the
quality of services delivered to chil-
dren and families and result in an esti-
mated cost of $54,000 per worker leav-
ing an agency.
Greater action is needed to ensure
that individuals pursuing child welfare
careers receive appropriate training
and support to improve the sustain-
ability of their important, yet demand-
ing work. Higher rates of retention for
child welfare workers translates to
greater stability for families and im-
proved services for vulnerable youth.
Existing research provides a number of
evidenced-based and promising prac-
tices for improving recruitment and re-
tention in the child welfare workforce.
This is why I am pleased to introduce
today the Child Welfare Workforce
Support Act. This bill directs the Sec-
retary to conduct a five-year dem-
onstration program for child welfare
service providers to implement tar-
geted interventions to recruit, select,
and retain child welfare workers. This
demonstration program will focus on
building an evidence base of best prac-
tices for reducing barriers to the re-
cruitment, development, and retention
of individuals providing direct services
to children and families. Funds will
also be used to provide ongoing profes-
sional development to assist child wel-
fare workers in meeting the diverse
needs of families with infants and chil-
dren with the goal of improving both
the quality of services provided and the
sustainability of such careers. Invest-
ing resources in determining what
practices have the greatest impact on
the successful recruitment and reten-
tion of child welfare workers will assist
in developing an evidence-base for fu-
ture federal investment in this space.
I hope that as the Senate begins to
discuss reauthorizing the Child Abuse
Prevention and Treatment Act that we
consider the Child Welfare Workforce
Support Act and recognize the impor-
tant role that child welfare workers
make to improve outcomes for vulner-
able infants and children.
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and
Ms. BALDWIN):
S. 1073. A bill to amend the Child
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act
to ensure protections for lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgender youth and
their families; to the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, according
to the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), lesbian, gay,
and bisexual (LGB) youth are at an in-
creased risk for experiencing maltreat-
ment compared to non-LGB youth. A
2011 meta-analysis of 37 school-based
studies found that LGB adolescents
were 3.8 times more likely to experi-
ence childhood sexual abuse and 1.2
times more likely to experience phys-
ical abuse by a parent or guardian
when compared to their heterosexual
peers. Additional studies have dem-
onstrated that gender nonconformity
during childhood may increase the risk
for child maltreatment. Unfortunately,
there is not enough research and data
available to identify the risk of child
maltreatment for individuals who iden-
tify as transgender.
These risks for maltreatment often
times result in LGBTQ youth entering
the child welfare system. Studies have
found that, ‘‘LGBT young people are
overrepresented in child welfare sys-
tems, despite the fact that they are
likely to be underreported because
they risk harassment and abuse if their
LGBT identity is disclosed.’’ This over-
representation of LGBTQ youth in the
foster care system raises concerns
about issues in the child abuse and pre-
vention space. Additional research is
needed to understand the risk of mal-
treatment among LGBTQ youth, par-
ticularly those identifying as
transgender. These studies will yield
invaluable information to be used in
developing targeted prevention strate-
gies to reduce the rates of adverse
childhood experiences of LGBTQ indi-
viduals.
This is why I am pleased to introduce
the Protecting LGBTQ Youth Act,
which calls for HHS and other federal
agencies to carry out an interdiscipli-
nary research program to protect
LGBTQ youth from child abuse and ne-
glect and improve the well-being of vic-
tims of child abuse or neglect. This leg-
islation also expands current practices
around demographic information col-
lection and reporting on incidences and
prevalence of child maltreatment to in-
clude sexual orientation and gender
identity. Additionally, the bill opens
existing grant funding opportunities to
invest in the training of personnel in
best practices to meet the unique needs
of LGBTQ youth and calls for the in-
clusion of individuals experienced in
working with LGBTQ youth and fami-
lies in state task forces. Improving
data collection and disaggregation will
provide greater insight into the cir-
cumstances LGBTQ youth face in the
home that, when left unaddressed, lead
to entry into the child welfare system.
This improved data-driven under-
standing can then be used to develop
appropriate and effective primary pre-
vention practices to decrease the risks
faced by LGTBQ youth.
I hope that as the Senate begins to
discuss the reauthorization of the Child
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act
we consider the Protecting LGBTQ
Youth Act to better inform our collec-
tive understanding of the risks faced
by LGBTQ youth and the best ways to
address them.

bia contributed more than 95 percent of
funds over the life of Plan Colombia, the po-
litical leadership, technical advice, military
assistance, and intelligence-sharing role of
the United States, along with the
$11,000,000,000 appropriated by the United
States Congress through Plan Colombia and
Peace Colombia to combat the illicit nar-
cotics trade and transnational organized
crime, advance democratic governance, pro-
mote economic growth, and defend human
rights, played a key role in transforming a
nation on the brink to an increasingly peace-
ful and prosperous democracy, while also
safeguarding vital United States interests;
Whereas the Government of Colombia,
throughout the administrations of Presi-
dents Andres Pastrana, Alvaro Uribe, Juan
Manuel Santos, and Ivan Duque, has made
investments and shown remarkable coura-
geous leadership, often at great cost and sac-
rifice, to consolidate domestic security, so-
cioeconomic development, and the rule of
law that far exceed those contributions made
by the United States in Colombia;
Whereas, over the past 20 years, levels of
crime and violence have subsided sharply in
Colombia, with annual per capita homicide
rates declining from 62 per 100,000 people in
1999 to a record low of 23 per 100,000 people in
2017;
Whereas the alignment of improved secu-
rity and sound economic policies has trans-
lated into steady growth in Colombia’s Gross
Domestic Product, which increased from
$86,000,000,000 in 1999 to more than
$309,000,000,000 in 2017, and led to greater For-
eign Direct Investment, which grew from
$1,500,000,000 in 1999 to one of the highest in
Latin America at an estimated $14,000,000,000
in 2017;
Whereas the United States and Colombia
enjoy a robust economic relationship with
United States goods and services trade with
Colombia totaling an estimated
$36,100,000,000 in 2016, supporting over 100,000
jobs in the United States;
Whereas the Government of Colombia has
made impressive strides in reducing poverty
during the last 15 years, with the poverty
rate decreasing from 64 percent in 1999 to 27
percent in 2017, according to the World Bank;
Whereas, since 1999, the Government of Co-
lombia has expanded the presence of the
state across all 32 territorial departments,
has contributed to the professionalism of the
Colombian judiciary, and has improved the
capacity of the Colombian Army, Navy, Air
Force, and National Police;
Whereas Colombia is one of the United
States’ most consistent and strategic part-
ners through its support of United States
diplomatic objectives at the United Nations
and critical efforts made in the fight against
transnational organized crime and increased
security and rule of law overseas, including
in Central America’s Northern Triangle, Af-
ghanistan, and several countries in Africa;
Whereas Colombia signed a Memorandum
of Understanding with NATO in 2017 and is
the first NATO partner nation in Latin
America;
Whereas these gains are challenged by an
escalating crisis in Venezuela, which has
seen an influx of more than 1,200,000 Ven-
ezuelans into Colombia and the need for con-
tinued financial support to implement the
peace accord over the next 8 years;
Whereas the internal armed conflict has
victimized all Colombians, including women,
children, and Afro-descendant and indige-
nous peoples, and has led to the repeated tar-
geting of leading representatives of civil so-
ciety, including trade unionists, journalists,
human rights defenders, and other commu-
nity activists who remain at grave risk from
guerrilla groups, paramilitary successor or-
ganizations, organized criminal groups, and
corrupt local officials;
Whereas efforts to achieve lasting peace in
Colombia must address the hardships faced
by victims of the armed conflict, as exempli-
fied by the Government of Colombia’s Law
on Victims and Restitution of Land of 2011;
Whereas the prospects for national rec-
onciliation and sustainable peace in Colom-
bia rely on the effective delivery of justice
for victims of the conflict and the ability to
hold accountable and appropriately punish
perpetrators of serious violations of human
rights and international humanitarian law;
and
Whereas the work of Special Jurisdiction
for Peace—the transitional justice mecha-
nism created with the purpose of ensuring
accountability in the context of Colombia’s
internal armed conflict—is fundamental to
the implementation of the accords and the
consolidation of peace in the country: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) reaffirms the unwavering support of the
Government and people of the United States
for the people of Colombia in their pursuit of
peace and stabilization of territories pre-
viously in conflict so they can achieve their
aspiration to live in a country free of vio-
lence and organized crime;
(2) lauds efforts to bring an end to Colom-
bia’s enduring internal armed conflict;
(3) commends the work of the United Na-
tions Verification Mission in overseeing the
implementation of the 2016 peace accord and
the disarmament and reintegration of com-
batants;
(4) maintains its commitment to the more
than 7,000,000 victims of Colombia’s armed
conflict and urges the government and FARC
to hold accountable perpetrators of serious
violations of human rights and international
humanitarian law and ensure that they are
appropriately punished;
(5) encourages the Government of Colom-
bia to protect vulnerable populations who re-
main at risk in that country, including de-
fenders of human rights, those facing threats
due to crop substitution from the illicit crop
market, and Afro-descendant and indigenous
communities;
(6) encourages the Secretary of State to de-
velop a comprehensive strategy to assist the
Government of Colombia in managing the ef-
fects of the Venezuela crisis without endan-
gering or detracting from the successful im-
plementation and sustainability of the peace
accord and stabilization of territories pre-
viously in conflict in Colombia, and to fur-
ther strengthen the close bilateral partner-
ship shared by the Governments of the
United States and Colombia;
(7) reaffirms its commitment to continued
partnership between the Governments of the
United States and Colombia on issues of mu-
tual interest, including security, counter-
narcotics cooperation, combating
transnational organized crime, ensuring jus-
tice for those who have caused indelible
harm to our populations, reintegration of
FARC members, economic growth and in-
vestment with a focus on disadvantaged
communities, and educational and cultural
exchanges that strengthen diplomatic rela-
tions;
(8) supports the Special Jurisdiction for
Peace as an important transitional justice
mechanism and encourages the continuation
of its work as an important institution in
charge of guaranteeing truth, justice, and
victim’s reparations in the aftermath of the
country’s internal armed conflict; and
(9) commits to furthering the bilateral re-
lationship between the United States and Co-
lombia by working with leaders in the public
and private sectors, as well as civil society
from both countries, to ensure that the
United States-Colombia relationship re-
mains at the forefront of United States for-
eign policy.

ant Principals Week’’;
Whereas an assistant principal, as a mem-
ber of the school administration, interacts
with many sectors of the school community,
including support staff, instructional staff,
students, and parents;
Whereas assistant principals are respon-
sible for establishing a positive learning en-
vironment and building strong relationships
between school and community;
Whereas assistant principals play a pivotal
role in the instructional leadership of their
schools by supervising student instruction,
mentoring teachers, recognizing the achieve-

among staff, ensuring the implementation of
best practices, monitoring student achieve-
ment and progress, facilitating and modeling
data-driven decisionmaking to inform in-

SENATE RESOLUTION 150—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE
SENATE THAT IT IS THE POLICY
OF THE UNITED STATES TO
COMMEMORATE THE ARMENIAN
GENOCIDE THROUGH OFFICIAL
RECOGNITION AND REMEM-
BRANCE
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr.
CRUZ, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Ms. STABENOW,
Mr. MARKEY, Ms. WARREN, Mr. PETERS,
Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. WYDEN, Ms.
DUCKWORTH, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. REED, Mr.
SCHUMER, Mr. GARDNER, Mr. UDALL,
and Ms. HARRIS) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions:
S. RES. 150
Whereas the United States has a proud his-
tory of recognizing and condemning the Ar-
menian Genocide, the killing of an estimated
1,500,000 Armenians by the Ottoman Empire
from 1915 to 1923, and providing relief to the
survivors of the campaign of genocide
against Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians,
Chaldeans, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites,
and other Christians;
Whereas the Honorable Henry Morgenthau,
Sr., United States Ambassador to the Otto-
man Empire from 1913 to 1916, organized and
led protests by officials of many countries
against what he described as ‘‘a campaign of
race extermination,’’ and, on July 16, 1915,
was instructed by United States Secretary of
State Robert Lansing that the ‘‘Department
approves your procedure . . . to stop Arme-
nian persecution’’;
Whereas President Woodrow Wilson en-
couraged the formation of Near East Relief,
chartered by an Act of Congress, which
raised approximately $116,000,000 (more than
$2,500,000,000 in 2019 dollars) between 1915 and
1930, and the Senate adopted resolutions con-
demning the massacres;
Whereas Raphael Lemkin, who coined the
term ‘‘genocide’’ in 1944 and who was the ear-
liest proponent of the United Nations Con-
vention on the Prevention and Punishment
of the Crime of Genocide, invoked the Arme-
nian case as a definitive example of genocide
in the 20th century;
Whereas, as displayed in the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum, Adolf Hitler,
on ordering his military commanders to at-
tack Poland without provocation in 1939, dis-
missed objections by saying, ‘‘Who, after all,
speaks today of the annihilation of the Ar-
menians?,’’ setting the stage for the Holo-
caust;
Whereas the United States has officially
recognized the Armenian Genocide—
(1) through the May 28, 1951, written state-
ment of the United States Government to
the International Court of Justice regarding
the Convention on the Prevention and Pun-
ishment of the Crime of Genocide and Proc-
lamation No. 4838 issued by President Ronald
Reagan on April 22, 1981; and
(2) by House Joint Resolution 148, 94th
Congress, agreed to April 8, 1975, and House
Joint Resolution 247, 98th Congress, agreed
to September 10, 1984; and
Whereas the Elie Wiesel Genocide and
Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018 (Public
Law 115–441) establishes that the prevention
of atrocities is a national interest of the
United States and affirms that it is the pol-
icy of the United States to pursue a United
States Government-wide strategy to iden-
tify, prevent, and respond to the risk of
atrocities by ‘‘strengthening diplomatic re-
sponse and the effective use of foreign assist-
ance to support appropriate transitional jus-
tice measures, including criminal account-
ability, for past atrocities’’: Now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate
that it is the policy of the United States—
(1) to commemorate the Armenian Geno-
cide through official recognition and remem-
brance;
(2) to reject efforts to enlist, engage, or
otherwise associate the United States Gov-
ernment with denial of the Armenian Geno-
cide or any other genocide; and
(3) to encourage education and public un-
derstanding of the facts of the Armenian
Genocide, including the role of the United
States in humanitarian relief efforts, and the
relevance of the Armenian Genocide to mod-
ern-day crimes against humanity.

SENATE RESOLUTION 151—TO AU-
THORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCU-

IN UNITED STATES V.
PRATERSCH
Mr. MCCONNELL (for himself and

agreed to:
S. RES. 151
Whereas, in the case of United States v.
Pratersch, Cr. No. 19–26, pending in the
United States District Court for the Middle
District of Florida, the prosecution has re-
quested the production of testimony from
Greta Hasler, an employee of the office of
Senator Bernard Sanders;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and
704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government Act of
1978, 2 U.S.C. §§ 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the
Senate may direct its counsel to represent
current and former Members and employees
of the Senate with respect to any subpoena,
order, or request for testimony relating to
their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of
the United States and Rule XI of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under
the control or in the possession of the Senate
may, by the judicial or administrative proc-
ess, be taken from such control or possession
but by permission of the Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence
under the control or in the possession of the
Senate may promote the administration of
justice, the Senate will take such action as
will promote the ends of justice consistent
with the privileges of the Senate: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That Greta Hasler, an employee
of the Office of Senator Bernard Sanders, and
any other current or former employee of the
Senator’s office from whom relevant evi-
dence may be necessary, are authorized to
testify and produce documents in the case of
United States v. Pratersch, except concerning
matters for which a privilege should be as-
serted.
SEC. 2. The Senate Legal Counsel is author-
ized to represent Senator Sanders and any
current or former employees of his office in
connection with the production of evidence
authorized in section one of this resolution.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
behalf of myself and the distinguished
Democratic leader, Mr. SCHUMER, I
send to the desk a resolution author-
izing the production of testimony, doc-
uments, and representation by the Sen-
ate Legal Counsel, and ask for its im-
mediate consideration.
Mr. President, this resolution con-
cerns a request for evidence in a crimi-
nal action pending in Florida Federal
district court. In this action the de-
fendant is charged with threatening to
assault and murder Senator SANDERS
in voicemails he left with the Senator’s
Burlington, Vermont office. A trial is
scheduled for April 29, 2019.
The prosecution is seeking testimony
from one of the Senator’s staff assist-
ants who listened to the voicemails at
issue. Senator SANDERS would like to
cooperate with this request by pro-
viding relevant employee testimony
and documents from his office.
The enclosed resolution would au-
thorize that staffer, and any other cur-
rent or former employee of the Sen-
ator’s office from whom relevant evi-
dence may be necessary, to testify and
produce documents in this action, with
representation by the Senate Legal
Counsel of such staffers and Senator
SANDERS.

gressional Accountability Act (CAA or the
Act) in 1995, Procedural Rules were adopted
to govern the processing of cases and con-
troversies under the administrative proce-
dures established in subchapter IV of the
CAA. 2 U.S.C. 1401–07. Those Rules of Proce-
dure were amended in 1998, 2004, and again in
2016. The existing Rules of Procedure are
available in their entirety on the public
website of the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights (OCWR): www.ocwr.gov.
Pursuant to section 303(a) of the CAA (2
U.S.C. 1383(a)), the Executive Director of the
OCWR has obtained approval of its Board of
Directors regarding certain amendments to
the Rules of Procedure.
After obtaining the Board’s approval, the
OCWR Executive Director must then ‘‘pub-
lish a general notice of proposed rulemaking
. . . for publication in the Congressional
Record on the first day on which both Houses
are in session following such transmittal.’’
(Section 303(b) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1383(b)).

Supplementary Information
The Congressional Accountability Act of
1995, Pub. L. No. 104–1, was enacted into law
on January 23, 1995. The CAA applies the
rights and protections of 13 federal labor and
employment statutes to covered employees
and employing offices within the legislative
branch of the federal government. Section
301 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381) establishes the
OCWR as an independent office within that
branch. Section 303 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1383)
directs the Executive Director, as Chief Op-
erating Officer, to adopt rules of procedure
governing the OCWR, subject to approval by
the Board of Directors of the Office. The
OCWR Rules of Procedure establish the proc-
ess by which alleged violations of the 13 laws
made applicable to the legislative branch
under the CAA are considered and resolved.
On December 21, 2018, the Congressional
Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act was
signed into law. (Pub. L. No. 115–397). The
new law reflects the first set of comprehen-
sive reforms to the CAA since 1995. Among
other reforms, the Act substantially modi-
fies the administrative dispute resolution
(ADR) process under the CAA, including:
providing for preliminary hearing officer re-
view of claims; requiring current and former
Members of Congress to reimburse awards or
settlement payments resulting from harass-
ment or retaliation claims; requiring certain
employing offices to reimburse payments re-
sulting from specified claims of discrimina-
tion; and appointing advisers to provide con-
fidential information to legislative branch
employees about their rights under the CAA.
Most changes to the ADR process will be ef-
fective 180 days from the date of enactment
of the Reform Act, i.e., on June 19, 2019.
These proposed amendments to the
OCWR’s Procedural Rules are the result of
the OCWR’s comprehensive review of the
OCWR’s procedures in light of the changes in
the Reform Act to the ADR program, and
they reflect the OCWR’s experience proc-
essing disputes under the CAA since the
original adoption of these Rules in 1995.
Scope of Comments Requested
The OCWR asks commenters to provide
their views on the changes to the Procedural
Rules proposed by the OCWR.
Summary of the Changes
Subpart A. Subpart A of the Procedural
Rules covers general provisions pertaining to
scope and policy, definitions, and informa-
tion on various filings and computation of
time. The OCWR’s proposed amendments to
subpart A provide additional definitions, and
also clarify pleading requirements and proce-
dures concerning confidentiality.
Subpart B. Currently, subpart B of the Pro-
cedural Rules sets forth the pre-complaint
procedures applicable to consideration of al-
leged violations of sections 201 through 207 of
the CAA, which concern employment dis-
crimination, family and medical leave, fair
labor standards, employee polygraph protec-
tion, worker adjustment and retraining, em-
ployment and reemployment of veterans, and
reprisal. Specifically, subpart B sets forth
procedures for mandatory pre-complaint
counseling and mediation, as well as the
statutory election to file either an adminis-
trative complaint with the OCWR or a civil
action in a U.S. district court. Under the
CAA Reform Act, however, counseling and
mediation are no longer mandatory jurisdic-
tional prerequisites to adjudication of an al-
leged violation of sections 201–07 of the CAA.
Therefore, the OCWR proposes to remove the
procedures for mandatory counseling and
mandatory mediation from subpart B. Under
the proposed rules, the remaining provisions
of subpart B—which concern mediation and
the statutory election—appear in subpart D.
The OCWR proposes to reserve a new sub-
part B for proposed rules and procedures for
enforcement of the inspection, investigation
and complaint sections 210(d) and (f) of the
CAA, which relate to Public Services and Ac-
commodations under titles II and III of the
Americans with Disabilities Act. (Subpart C
had been reserved for these rules since 1995.)
Subpart C. The OCWR proposes to redesig-
nate the contents of current subpart D as
subpart C. Therefore, sections 3.01 through
3.15 of this subpart prescribe rules and proce-
dures for enforcement of the inspection and
citation provisions of section 215(c)(1)
through (3) of the CAA, which concern the
protections set forth in the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHAct). Sec-
tions 3.20 through 3.31 contain rules of prac-
tice for administrative proceedings to grant
variances and other relief under sections
6(b)(6)(A) and 6(d) of the OSHAct, as applied
by section 215(c)(4) of the CAA. The proposed
modifications to subpart C reflect nomen-
clature changes only. The modifications
clarify that references to the ‘‘Hearing Offi-
cer’’ in this subpart are to the ‘‘Merits Hear-
ing Officer’’ (defined in these proposed rules
as the individual appointed by the Executive
Director to preside over an administrative
hearing conducted on matters within the Of-
fice’s jurisdiction under section 405 of the
Act), and not the ‘‘Preliminary Hearing Offi-
cer’’ (defined in these proposed rules as the
individual appointed by the Executive Direc-
tor to make a preliminary review of claims
arising under sections 102(c) and 201 through
207 of the CAA).
Subparts D and E. The Procedural Rules
currently set forth a single set of procedures
for filing ‘‘complaints’’ under the CAA,
whether the complaint is filed with the
OCWR by an employee alleging violations of
sections 201 through 207 of the Act, or by the
OCWR General Counsel alleging violations of
sections 210, 215 or 220 of the Act. The CAA
Reform Act, however, uses the word ‘‘claim’’
to refer to an alleged violation of sections
201 through 207 of the Act (as well as an al-
leged violation of section 102(c) of the Act,
which incorporates the protections of the
Genetic Information Nondisclosure Act). As
a result, the term ‘‘complaint’’ in the CAA
refers only to violations alleged by the
OCWR General Counsel.
Because the procedures in the Reform Act
governing employee ‘‘claims’’ differ signifi-
cantly from those governing General Counsel
‘‘complaints,’’ these proposed rules set forth
separate procedures for each. Therefore, sub-
part D, which concerns employee ‘‘claims,’’
includes new procedures for informal em-
ployee requests for advice and information;
confidential advising services; filing of
claims; electing to file a civil action; initial
processing and transmission of claims to par-
ties; notification requirements; voluntary
mediation; preliminary review of claims by a
‘‘Preliminary Hearing Officer;’’ requesting
an administrative hearing before a ‘‘Merits
Hearing Officer;’’ summary judgment and
withdrawal of claims; confidentiality re-
quirements; and automatic referral to con-
gressional ethics committees.
Proposed subpart E, which concerns Gen-
eral Counsel complaints, sets forth proce-
dures for filing complaints, appointment of
the Merits Hearing Officer, dismissals, sum-
mary judgment, withdrawal of complaints,
and confidentiality requirements. The new
provisions in the Reform Act governing mat-
ters such as confidential advising services,
preliminary review of claims, and automatic
referral to congressional ethics committees,
do not apply to OCWR General Counsel com-
plaints alleging violations of sections 210, 215
or 220 of the Act. Therefore, they are not ad-
dressed in proposed subpart E.
Subparts F–H. Subparts F and G include the
process for the conduct of administrative
hearings held as the result of the filing of an
administrative claim or an administrative
complaint. Subpart H sets forth the proce-
dures for appeals of decisions by Hearing Of-
ficers to the OCWR Board of Directors and
for appeals of decisions by the Board of Di-
rectors to the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Federal Circuit.
Proposed amendments to subpart F con-
cern such matters as depositions requests in
cases in which a Member of Congress is an
intervenor, rulings on motions to quash and
motions to limit, and formal requirements
for sworn statements. Proposed amendments
to subpart G clarify the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer’s authority concerning frivolous claims,

defenses, and arguments. The proposed
amendments also set forth the substantive
requirements for the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer’s written decision, including required
findings when a final decision concerns a
claim alleging a violation or violations de-
scribed in section 415(d)(1)(C) of the Act,
which requires Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate to reimburse the
‘‘compensatory damages’’ portion of a deci-
sion, award or settlement for a violation of
section 201(a), 206(a), or 207 of the Act that
the Member is found to have ‘‘committed
personally.’’ Proposed Amendments to sub-
part H concern appellate proceedings before
the Board. They clarify that a report on pre-
liminary review pursuant to section 402(c) of
the CAA is not appealable to the Board.
Subpart I. Subpart I concerns other mat-
ters of general applicability to the dispute
resolution process and to the OCWR’s oper-
ations. Proposed amendments to subpart I
concern requests for attorney fees in arbitra-
tion proceedings; informal resolution of dis-
putes; general requirements for formal set-
tlement agreements—including settlement
of cases making allegations against a Mem-
ber of Congress subject to the payment reim-
bursement provisions of section 415(d) of the
Act.
The proposed amendments to subpart I
also concern payments governed by section
415(a) of the CAA, which provides, in rel-
evant part, that ‘‘only funds which are ap-
propriated to an account of the Office in the
Treasury of the United States for the pay-
ment of awards and settlements may be used
for the payment of awards and settlements
under this chapter.’’ Pursuant to section
415(a), the OCWR, through its Executive Di-
rector, prepares and processes requisitions
for disbursements from the Treasury account
established pursuant to section 415(a) when
qualifying final decisions, awards, or ap-
proved settlements require the payment of
funds. These proposed amendments provide
further guidance for processing certifi-
cations of payments from the funds appro-
priated to the Section 415(a) Treasury Ac-
count. They are based on regulations issued
by the Department of Treasury’s Bureau of
Fiscal Services at 31 C.F.R. part 256, which
provide guidance to agencies in the execu-
tive branch for submitting requests for pay-
ments from the Judgment Fund, which is a
permanent, indefinite appropriation that is
available to pay many judicially and admin-
istratively ordered monetary awards against
the United States. The proposed amend-
ments also concern reimbursement to the
Section 415(a) Treasury Account in cases
when the Act requires: (1) Members of the
House of Representatives and the Senate to
reimburse the ‘‘compensatory damages’’ por-
tion of a decision, award or settlement for a
violation of section 201(a), 206(a), or 207 that
the Member is found to have ‘‘committed
personally;’’ and (2) employing offices (other
than an employing office of the House or
Senate) to reimburse awards and settlements
paid from the Section 415(a) Treasury Ac-
count in connection with claims alleging
violations of section 201(a) or 206(a) of the
Act.
The proposed amendments to subpart I
also add a new section governing the require-
ment in the Reform Act that employing of-
fices must post and keep posted in con-
spicuous places on their premises the notices
provided by the OCWR, which contain infor-
mation about employees’ rights and the
OCWR’s ADR process, along with OCWR con-
tact information. Finally, the proposed
amendments set forth rules concerning the
new requirement in the Reform Act that
each employing office (other than any em-
ploying office of the House of Representa-
tives or any employing office of the Senate)
submit a report both to the Committee on
House Administration of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Committee on Rules
and Administration of the Senate on the im-
plementation of the training and education
program required under section 438(a) of the
Act.

cate by the signer that the signer has read

tion, and belief formed after reasonable in-
quiry, each of the following is correct:

purpose, such as to harass, cause unneces-
sary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of
resolution of the matter;
(2) The claims, defenses, and other legal
contentions the party advocates are war-
ranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous
argument for extending, modifying, or re-
versing existing law or for establishing new
law;
(3) The factual contentions have evi-
dentiary support or, if specifically so identi-
fied, will likely have evidentiary support
after a reasonable opportunity for further re-
view or discovery; and
(4) The denials of factual contentions are
warranted on the evidence or, if specifically
so identified, are reasonably based on belief
or a lack of information.

two sentences of paragraph (c) and revising the

§ 1.07 Designation of Representative.
* * * * *

ative. A revocation of a designation of rep-
resentative, whether made by the party or
by the representative with notice to the
party, must be made in writing and filed
with the Office. The revocation will be
deemed effective the date of receipt by the
Office. Consistent with any applicable statu-
tory time limit, at the discretion of the Ex-
ecutive Director, General Counsel, mediator,
hearing officer, or Board, additional time
may be provided to allow the party to des-
ignate a new representative as consistent
with the Act.
8. Amend section 1.08 by:
(a) Revising paragraphs (a) through (e); and
(b) Republishing paragraph (f).
The revisions read as follows:
§ 1.08 Confidentiality.
(a) Policy. Except as provided in sections
302(d) and 416(c), (d), and (e) of the Act, the
Office shall maintain confidentiality in the
confidential advising process, mediation, and
the proceedings and deliberations of hearing
officers and the Board in accordance with
sections 302(d)(2)(B) and 416(a)–(b) of the Act.
(b) Participant. For the purposes of this
rule, ‘‘participant’’ means an individual or
entity who takes part as either a party, wit-
ness, or designated representative in con-
fidential advising under section 302(d) of the
Act, mediation under section 404, the claim
and hearing process under section 405, or an
appeal to the Board under section 406 of the
Act, or any related proceeding which is ex-
pressly or by necessity deemed confidential
under the Act or these rules.
(c) Prohibition. Unless specifically author-
ized by the provisions of the Act or by these
rules, no participant in the confidential ad-
vising process, mediation, or other pro-
ceedings made confidential under section 416
of the Act may disclose a written or an oral
communication that is prepared for the pur-
pose of or that occurs during the confidential
advising process, mediation, and the pro-
ceedings and deliberations of Hearing Offi-
cers and the Board.
(d) Exceptions. Nothing in these rules pro-
hibits a party or its representative from dis-
closing information obtained in mediation or
hearings when reasonably necessary to in-
vestigate claims, ensure compliance with the
Act, or prepare its prosecution or defense.
However, the party making the disclosure
shall take all reasonably appropriate steps
to ensure that persons to whom the informa-
tion is disclosed maintain the confiden-
tiality of such information. These rules do
not preclude a mediator from consulting
with the Office, except that when the cov-
ered employee is an employee of the Office,
a mediator shall not consult with any indi-
vidual within the Office who is or who might
be a party or witness. These rules do not pre-
clude the Office from reporting information
to the Senate and House of Representatives
as required by the Act.
(e) Contents or Records of Mediation or Hear-
ings. For the purpose of this rule, the con-
tents or records of the confidential advising
process, mediation or other proceeding in-
cludes the information disclosed by partici-
pants to the proceedings, and records dis-
closed by the opposing party, witnesses, or
the Office. A participant is free to disclose
facts and other information obtained from
any source outside of the mediation or hear-
ing. For example, an employing office or its
representatives may disclose information
about its employment practices and per-
sonnel actions, provided that the informa-
tion was not obtained in a confidential pro-
ceeding. However, a claimant who obtains
that information in mediation or other con-
fidential proceeding may not disclose such
information. Similarly, information forming
the basis for the allegation of a claimant
may be disclosed by that claimant, provided
that the information contained in those alle-
gations was not obtained in a confidential
proceeding. However, the employing office or
its representatives may not disclose that in-
formation if it was obtained in a confidential
proceeding.
(f) Sanctions. The Executive Director will
advise all participants in the mediation and
hearing at the time they became partici-
pants of the confidentiality requirements of
section 416 of the Act and that sanctions
may be imposed by a Hearing Officer for a
violation of those requirements. No sanc-
tions may be imposed except for good cause
and the particulars of which must be stated
in the sanction order.

tial Advisors. The Executive Director shall

practice before, and is in good standing with,
the bar of a State or territory of the United
States or the District of Columbia, and who
has experience representing clients in cases

ceeding, including any proceeding under the
Act, any judicial proceeding, or any pro-
ceeding before any committee of Congress. A
Confidential Advisor may not offer or pro-
vide any of the services in section 302(d)(2) of

ignated an attorney representative in con-
nection with the employee’s participation in
any proceeding under the Act, except that

eral assistance and information to the attor-
ney representative regarding the Act and the
role of the Office, as the Confidential Advi-
sor deems appropriate.

ployee has accepted and received any serv-
ices offered under section 302(d)(2) of the Act

ices requested under section 302(d)(2) by the
covered employee shall be provided, to the
extent practicable, by the same Confidential
Advisor.

fidential Advisor. The services provided by a

covered employee, including any unpaid staff

resentative, or proceeding without represen-
tation for proceedings before the Office;

ployee for each such claim;
(4) assisting, on a privileged and confiden-
tial basis, a covered employee who seeks
consideration under title IV of an allegation
of a violation of sections 102(c) or 201–07 of
the Act in understanding the procedures, and
the significance of the procedures, described

ered employee regarding the drafting of a
claim form to be filed under section 402(a) of

cumstances, a complaint with the Com-
mittee on Ethics of the House of Representa-
tives or the Select Committee on Ethics of

the Confidential Advisor is not the employ-
ee’s representative, the services provided
under subparagraph (c) of this section, and
any related communications between the
Confidential Advisor and the employee be-
fore or after the filing of a claim, shall be
strictly confidential and shall be privileged
from discovery. All of the records main-
tained by a Confidential Advisor regarding
communications between the employee and
the Confidential Advisor are the property of
the Confidential Advisor and not the Office,
are not records of the Office within the

§ 4.07 Mediation.
(a) Overview. Mediation is a process in
which employees, including unpaid staff for
purposes of section 201 of the Act, employing
offices, and their representatives, if any,
meet with a mediator trained to assist them
in resolving disputes. As participants in the
mediation, employees, employing offices,
and their representatives discuss alter-
natives to continuing their dispute, includ-
ing the possibility of reaching a voluntary,
mutually satisfactory resolution. The medi-
ator cannot impose a specific resolution, and
all information discussed or disclosed in the
course of any mediation shall be strictly
confidential, pursuant to section 416 of the
Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, section
416 expressly provides that a covered em-
ployee may disclose the ‘‘factual allegations
underlying the covered employee’s claim’’
and an employing office may disclose ‘‘the
factual allegations underlying the employing
office’s defense to the claim[.]’’
(b) Availability of Optional Mediation. Upon
receipt of a claim filed pursuant to section
402 of the Act, the Office shall notify the cov-
ered employee and the employing office
about the process for mediation and applica-
ble deadlines. If the claim alleges a Member

committed an act made unlawful under sec-
tions 201(a), 206(a) or 207 of the Act which
consists of a violation of section 415(d)(1)(A),
the Office shall permit the Member to inter-
vene in the mediation. The request for medi-
ation shall contain the claim number, the re-
questing party’s name, office or personal ad-
dress, e-mail address, telephone number, and
the opposing party’s name. Failure to re-
quest mediation does not adversely impact
future proceedings.
(c) Timing. The covered employee or the
employing office may file a written request
for mediation beginning on the date that the
covered employee or employing office, re-
spectively, receives notice from the Office
about the mediation process. The time to re-
quest mediation under these rules ends on
the date on which a Merits Hearing Officer
issues a written decision on the claim, or the
covered employee files a civil action,
(d) Notice of Commencement of the Mediation.
The Office shall promptly notify the oppos-
ing party or its designated representative of
the request for mediation and the deadlines
applicable to such mediation. When a claim
alleges a violation described in subpara-
graphs (A) and (B) of section 402(b)(2) of the
Act that consists of a violation described in
section 415(d)(1)(A) by a Member of Congress,
the Office shall notify immediately such
Member of the right to intervene in any me-
diation concerning the claim.
(e) Selection of Mediators; Disqualification.
Upon receipt of the second party’s agreement
to mediate, the Executive Director shall as-
sign one or more mediators from a master
list developed and maintained pursuant to
section 404 of the Act, to commence the me-
diation process. Should the mediator con-
sider himself or herself unable to perform in
a neutral role in a given situation, he or she
shall withdraw from the matter and imme-
diately shall notify the Office of the with-
drawal. Any party may ask the Office to dis-
qualify a mediator by filing a written re-
quest, including the reasons for such request,
with the Executive Director. This request
shall be filed as soon as the party has reason
to believe there is a basis for disqualifica-
tion. The Executive Director’s decision on
this request shall be final and unreviewable.
(f) Duration and Extension.
(1) The mediation period shall be 30 days
beginning on the first day after the second
party agrees to mediate the matter.
(2) The Executive Director shall extend the
mediation period an additional 30 days upon
the joint written request of the parties, or of
the appointed mediator on behalf of the par-
ties. The request shall be written and filed
with the Executive Director no later than
the last day of the mediation period.
(g) Effect of Mediation on Proceedings.
Upon the parties’ agreement to mediate a
claim, any deadline relating to the proc-
essing of that claim that has not already
passed by the first day of the mediation pe-
riod, shall be stayed during the mediation
period.
(h) Procedures.
(1) The Mediator’s Role. After assignment of
the case, the mediator will contact the par-
ties. The mediator has the responsibility to
conduct the mediation, including deciding
how many meetings are necessary and who
may participate in each meeting. The medi-
ator may accept and may ask the parties to
provide written submissions.
(2) The Agreement to Mediate. At the com-
mencement of the mediation, the mediator
will ask the participants and/or their rep-
resentatives to sign an agreement prepared
by the Office (‘‘the Agreement to Mediate’’).
The Agreement to Mediate will define what
is to be kept confidential during mediation
and set out the conditions under which medi-
ation will occur, including the requirement
that the participants adhere to the confiden-
tiality of the process and a notice that a
breach of the mediation agreement could re-
sult in sanctions later in the proceedings.
(i) The parties, including an intervenor
Member, may elect to participate in medi-
ation proceedings through a designated rep-
resentative, provided that the representative
has actual authority to agree to a settle-
ment agreement, or has immediate access to
someone with actual settlement authority,
and provided further that, should the medi-
ator deem it appropriate at any time, the
physical presence in mediation of any party
may be required. The Office may participate
in the mediation process through a rep-
resentative and/or observer. The mediator
may determine, as best serves the interests
of mediation, whether the participants may
meet jointly or separately with the medi-
ator. At the request of any of the parties, the
parties shall be separated during medation.
(j) Informal Resolutions and Settlement
Agreements. At any time during mediation
the parties may resolve or settle a dispute in
accordance with subparagraph 9.03 of these
Rules.
(k) Conclusion of the Mediation Period and
Notice. If, at the end of the mediation period,
the parties have not resolved the matter
that forms the basis of the request for medi-
ation, the Office shall provide the employee,
Member, and the employing office, and their
representatives, with written notice that the
mediation period has concluded. The written
notice will be e-filed, e†mailed, sent by first-
class mail, faxed, or personally delivered.
(l) Independence of the Mediation Process
and the Mediator. The Office will maintain
the independence of the mediation process
and the mediator. No individual appointed
by the Executive Director to mediate may
conduct or aid in a hearing conducted under
section 405 of the Act with respect to the
same matter or shall be subject to subpoena
or any other compulsory process with re-
spect to the same matter.
(m) Violation of Confidentiality in Mediation.
An alleged violation of the confidentiality
provisions may be made by a party in medi-
ation to the mediator during the mediation
period and, if not resolved by agreement in
mediation, to a Merits Hearing Officer dur-
ing proceedings brought under section 405 of
the Act.
(n) Exceptions to Confidentiality in Medi-
ation. It shall not be a violation of confiden-
tiality to provide the information required
by sections 301(l) and 416(d) of the Act.
§ 4.08 Preliminary Review of Claims.
(a) Appointment of Preliminary Hearing Offi-
cer. Not later than 7 days after transmission
to the employing office of a claim or claims,
the Executive Director shall appoint a hear-
ing officer to conduct a preliminary review
of the claim or claims filed by the claimant.
The appointment of the Preliminary Hearing
Officer shall be in accordance with the re-
quirements of section 405(c) of the Act.
(b) Disqualifying a Preliminary Hearing Offi-
cer.
(1) In the event that a Preliminary Hearing
Officer considers himself or herself disquali-
fied, either because of personal bias or of an
interest in the case or for some other dis-
qualifying reason, he or she shall withdraw
from the case, stating in writing or on the
record the reasons for his or her withdrawal,
and shall immediately notify the Office of
the withdrawal.
(2) Any party may file a motion requesting
that a Preliminary Hearing Officer withdraw
on the basis of personal bias or of an interest
in the case or for some other disqualifying
reason. This motion shall specifically set
forth the reasons supporting the request and
be filed as soon as the party has reason to be-
lieve that there is a basis for disqualifica-
tion.
(3) The Preliminary Hearing Officer shall
promptly rule on the withdrawal motion. If
the motion is granted, the Executive Direc-
tor will appoint another Preliminary Hear-
ing Officer within 3 days. Any objection to
the Preliminary Hearing Officer’s ruling on
the withdrawal motion shall not be deemed
waived by a party’s further participation in
the preliminary review process. Such objec-
tion will not stay the conduct of the prelimi-
nary review process.
(c) Assessments Required. In conducting a
preliminary review of a claim or claims
under this section, the Preliminary Hearing
Officer shall assess each of the following:
(1) whether the claimant is a covered em-
ployee authorized to obtain relief relating to
the claim(s) under the Act;
(2) whether the office which is the subject
of the claim(s) is an employing office under
the Act;
(3) whether the individual filing the
claim(s) has met the applicable deadlines for
filing the claim(s) under the Act;
(4) the identification of factual and legal
issues in the claim(s);
(5) the specific relief sought by the claim-
ant;
(6) whether, on the basis of the assess-
ments made under paragraphs (1) through
(5), the claimant is a covered employee who
has stated a claim for which, if the allega-
tions contained in the claim are true, relief
may be granted under the Act; and
(7) the potential for the settlement of the
claim(s) without a formal hearing as pro-
vided under section 405 of the Act or a civil
action as provided under section 408 of the
Act.
(d) Amendments to Claims. Amendments to
the claim(s) may be permitted in the Pre-
liminary Hearing Officer’s discretion, taking
the following factors into consideration:
(1) whether the amendments relate to the
cause of action set forth in the claim(s); and
(2) whether such amendments will unduly
prejudice the rights of the employing office,
or of other parties, unduly delay the prelimi-
nary review, or otherwise interfere with or
impede the proceedings.
(e) Report on Preliminary Review.
(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2),
not later than 30 days after a claim form is
filed, the Preliminary Hearing Officer shall
submit to the claimant and the respondent(s)
a report on the preliminary review. The re-
port shall include a determination whether
the claimant is a covered employee who has
stated a claim for which, if the allegations
contained in the claim are true, relief may
be granted under the Act. Submitting the re-
port concludes the preliminary review.
(2) In determining whether a claimant has
stated a claim for which relief may be grant-
ed under the Act, the Preliminary Hearing
Officer shall:
(A) be guided by judicial and Board deci-
sions under the laws made applicable by sec-
tion 102 of the Act; and
(B) consider whether the legal contentions
the claimant advocates are warranted by ex-
isting law or by a nonfrivolous argument for
extending, modifying, or reversing existing
law or for establishing new law.
(3) Extension of Deadline. The Preliminary
Hearing Officer may, upon notice to the indi-
vidual filing the claim(s) and the respond-
ent(s), use an additional period of not to ex-
ceed 30 days to conclude the preliminary re-
view.
(f) Effect of Determination of Failure to State
a Claim for which Relief may be Granted.
(1) If the Preliminary Hearing Officer’s re-
port under subparagraph (e) includes the de-
termination that the claimant is not a cov-
ered employee or has not stated a claim for
which relief may be granted under the Act:

not later than 90 days after receiving the
written notice referred to in subparagraph
(1)(B).
(g) Transmission of Report on Preliminary Re-
view of Certain Claims to Congressional Ethics
Committees. When a Preliminary Hearing Of-
ficer issues a report on the preliminary re-
view of a claim alleging a violation described
in section 415(d)(1)(A) of the Act, the Pre-
liminary Hearing Officer shall transmit the
report to—
(1) the Committee on Ethics of the House
of Representatives, in the case of such an al-
leged act by a Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives (including a Delegate or Resi-
dent Commissioner to the Congress); or
(2) the Select Committee on Ethics of the
Senate, in the case of such an alleged act by
a Senator.
§ 4.09 Request for Administrative Hearing.
(a) Except as provided in subparagraph (b),
a claimant may submit to the Executive Di-
rector a written request for an administra-
tive hearing under section 405 of the Act not
later than 10 days after the Preliminary
Hearing Officer submits the report on the
preliminary review of a claim under section
403(c).
(b) Subparagraph (a) does not apply to the
claim if—
(1) the preliminary review report of the
claim under section 403(c) of the Act includes
the determination that the individual filing
the claim is not a covered employee who has
stated a claim for which relief may be grant-
ed, as described in section 403(d) of the Act;
or
(2) the covered employee files a civil action
as to the claim as provided in section 408 of
the Act.
(c) Appointment of the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer.
(1) Upon the filing of a request for an ad-
ministrative hearing under subparagraph (a)
of this section, the Executive Director shall
appoint an independent Merits Hearing Offi-
cer to consider the claim(s) and render a de-
cision, who shall have the authority speci-
fied in sections 4.10 and 7.01 of these Rules
below.
(2) The Preliminary Hearing Officer shall
not serve as the Merits Hearing Officer in
the same case.
(d) Answer.
(1) Within 10 days after the filing of a re-
quest for an administrative hearing under
subparagraph (a), the respondent(s) shall file
an answer with the Office and serve one copy
on the claimant. Filing a motion to dismiss
a claim does not stay the time period for fil-

ent(s) must state in short and plain terms its
defenses to each claim asserted against it
and admit or deny the allegations asserted
against it.
(3) Failure to deny an allegation, other
than one relating to the amount of damages,
or to raise a defense as to any allegation(s)
shall constitute an admission of such allega-
tion(s). Affirmative defenses not raised in an
answer that could have reasonably been an-
ticipated based on the facts alleged in the
claim form shall be deemed waived.
(4) A respondent’s motion for leave to
amend an answer to interpose a denial or af-
firmative defense will ordinarily be granted
unless to do so would unduly prejudice the
rights of the other party or unduly delay or
otherwise interfere with or impede the pro-
ceedings.

miss the claim with prejudice.
(b) Summary Judgment. A Merits Hearing
Officer may, after notice and an opportunity
for the parties to address the question of
summary judgment, issue summary judg-
ment on the claim. A motion before the Mer-
its Hearing Officer asserting that the cov-
ered employee has failed to state a claim
upon which relief can be granted shall be
construed as a motion for summary judg-
ment on the ground that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as to that claim as a
matter of law.
(c) Appeal. A final decision by the Merits
Hearing Officer made under section 4.10 or
7.16 of these Rules may be subject to appeal
before the Board if the aggrieved party files
a timely petition for review under section
8.01 of these Rules. A final decision under
subparagraphs 4.10(a)–(d) of these Rules that
does not resolve all of the issues in the
case(s) before the Merits Hearing Officer
may not be appealed to the Board in advance
of a final decision entered under section 7.16
of these Rules, except as authorized pursuant
to section 7.13.
(d) Withdrawal of Claim. At any time, a
claimant may withdraw his or her own
claim(s) by filing a notice with the Office for
transmittal to the Preliminary or Merits
Hearing Officer and by serving a copy on the
respondent(s). Any such withdrawal must be
approved by the relevant Hearing Officer and
may be with or without prejudice to refile at
that Hearing Officer’s discretion.
(e) Withdrawal from a Case by a Representa-
tive. A representative must provide sufficient
notice to the Hearing Officer and the parties
of record of his or her withdrawal from a
case. Until the party designates another rep-
resentative in writing, the party will be re-
garded as appearing pro se.
§ 4.11 Confidentiality.
(a) Pursuant to section 416 of the Act, ex-
cept as provided in subsections 416(c), (d) and
(e), all proceedings and deliberations of
Hearing Officers and the Board, including
any related records, shall be confidential. A

of the Act and these rules may result in the
imposition of procedural or evidentiary sanc-
tions. See also sections 1.08, 1.09 and 7.12 of
these Rules.
(b) The fact that a request for an adminis-
trative hearing has been filed with the Office
by a covered employee shall be kept con-
fidential by the Office, except as allowed by
these Rules.

raised in an answer that could have reason-
ably been anticipated based on the facts al-
leged in the complaint shall be deemed
waived.
(4) A respondent’s motion for leave to
amend an answer to interpose a denial or af-
firmative defense will ordinarily be granted
unless to do so would unduly prejudice the
rights of the other party or unduly delay or
otherwise interfere with or impede the pro-
ceedings.
(g) Motion to Dismiss. In addition to an an-
swer, a respondent may file a motion to dis-
miss, or other responsive pleading with the
Office and serve one copy on the complain-
ant. Responses to any motions shall comply
with subparagraph 1.04(c) of these Rules. A
motion asserting that the General Counsel
has failed to state a claim upon which relief
can be granted may, in the Merits Hearing
Officer’s discretion, be construed as a motion
for summary judgment pursuant to subpara-
graph 5.03(d) of these Rules on the ground
that the moving party is entitled to judg-
ment as a matter of law.
§ 5.02 Appointment of the Merits Hearing Of-
ficer.
Upon the filing of a complaint, the Execu-
tive Director will appoint an independent
Merits Hearing Officer, who shall have the
authority specified in subparagraphs 5.03 and
7.01(b) of the Rules below.
§ 5.03 Dismissal, Summary Judgment and
Withdrawal of Complaints.
(a) A Merits Hearing Officer may, after no-
tice and an opportunity to respond, dismiss
any claim that the Merits Hearing Officer
finds to be frivolous or that fails to state a
claim upon which relief may be granted.
(b) A Merits Hearing Officer may, after no-
tice and an opportunity to respond, dismiss a
complaint because it fails to comply with
the applicable time limits or other require-
ments under the Act or these Rules.
(c) If the General Counsel fails to proceed
with an action, the Merits Hearing Officer
may dismiss the complaint with prejudice.
(d) Summary Judgment. A Merits Hearing
Officer may, after notice and an opportunity
for the parties to address the question of
summary judgment, issue summary judg-
ment on some or all of the complaint.
(e) Appeal. A final decision by the Merits
Hearing Officer made under sections 5.03(a)–
(d) or 7.16 of these Rules may be subject to
appeal before the Board if the aggrieved
party files a timely petition for review under
section 8.01. A final decision under old sub-
paragraph 5.03(a)–(d) that does not resolve all
of the claims or issues in the case(s) before
the Merits Hearing Officer may not be ap-
pealed to the Board in advance of a final de-
cision entered under section 7.16 of these
Rules, except as authorized pursuant to sec-
tion 7.13.
(f) Withdrawal of Complaint by the General
Counsel. At any time prior to the opening of
the hearing, the General Counsel may with-
draw his complaint by filing a notice with
the Office for transmittal to the Merits
Hearing Officer and by serving a copy on the
respondent. After opening of the hearing,
any such withdrawal must be approved by
the Merits Hearing Officer and may be with
or without prejudice to refile at the Merits
Hearing Officer’s discretion.
(g) Withdrawal from a Case by a Representa-
tive. A representative must provide sufficient
notice to the Merits Hearing Officer and the
parties of record of his or her withdrawal
from a case. Until the party designates an-
other representative in writing, the party
will be regarded as appearing pro se.
§ 5.04 Confidentiality.
Pursuant to section 416(b) of the Act, ex-
cept as provided in subsections 416(c) and (f),
all proceedings and deliberations of Merits
Hearing Officers and the Board, including
any related records, shall be confidential.
Section 416(b) does not apply to proceedings
under section 215 of the Act, but does apply
to the deliberations of Merits Hearing Offi-
cers and the Board under section 215. A vio-
lation of the confidentiality requirements of
the Act and these rules may result in the im-
position of procedural or evidentiary sanc-
tions. See also sections 1.08 and 7.12 of these
Rules.
SUBPART F—[AMENDED]
[Table of Contents Omitted]
Revise subpart F to read as follows:
§ 6.01 Discovery.
(a) Description. Discovery is the process by
which a party may obtain from another per-
son, including a party, information that is
not privileged and that is reasonably cal-
culated to lead to the discovery of admis-
sible evidence, to assist that party in devel-
oping, preparing and presenting its case at
the hearing. No discovery, whether oral or
written, by any party shall be taken of or
from an employee of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights (including but not
limited to a Board member, the Executive
Director, the General Counsel, a Confidential
Advisor, a mediator, a hearing officer, or un-
paid staff), including files, records, or notes
produced during the confidential advising,
mediation, and hearing phases of a case and
maintained by the Office, the Confidential
Advisor, the mediator, or the hearing officer.
(b) Initial Disclosure. Within 14 days after
the prehearing conference in cases com-
menced by the filing of a claim pursuant to
section 402(a) of the Act, and except as other-
wise stipulated or ordered by the Merits
Hearing Officer (the hearing officer ap-
pointed by the Executive Director to conduct
the administrative hearing), a party must,
without awaiting a discovery request, pro-
vide to the other parties: the name and, if
known, mail and e-mail addresses, and tele-
phone number of each individual likely to
have discoverable information that the dis-
closing party may use to support its causes
of action or defenses; and a copy or a descrip-
tion by category and location of all docu-
ments, electronically stored information,
and tangible things that the disclosing party
has in its possession, custody, or control and
may use to support its claims or defenses.
(c) Discovery Availability. Pursuant to sec-
tion 405(e) of the Act, reasonable prehearing
discovery may be permitted at the Merits
Hearing Officer’s discretion.
(1) The parties may take discovery by one
or more of the following methods: deposi-
tions upon oral examination or written ques-
tions; written interrogatories; production of
documents or things or permission to enter
upon land or other property for inspection or
other purposes; physical and mental exami-
nations; and requests for admissions. Noth-
ing in section 415(d) of the Act—dealing with
reimbursements by Members of Congress of
amounts paid as settlements and awards—
may be construed to require the claimant to
be deposed by counsel for the intervening
member in a deposition that is separate from
any other deposition taken from the claim-
ant in connection with the hearing or civil
action.
(2) The Merits Hearing Officer may adopt
standing orders or make any order setting
forth the forms and extent of discovery, in-
cluding orders limiting the number of depo-
sitions, interrogatories, and requests for pro-
duction of documents, and also may limit
the length of depositions.
(3) The Merits Hearing Officer may issue
any other order to prevent discovery or dis-
closure of confidential or privileged mate-
rials or information, as well as hearing or
trial preparation materials and any other in-
formation deemed not discoverable, or to
protect a party or person from annoyance,
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden
or expense.
(d) Claims of Privilege.
(1) Information Withheld. Whenever a party
withholds information otherwise discover-
able under these Rules by claiming that it is
privileged or confidential or subject to pro-
tection as hearing or trial preparation mate-
rials, the party shall make the claim of
privilege expressly in writing and shall de-
scribe the nature of the documents, commu-
nications or things not produced or disclosed
in a manner that, without revealing whether
the information itself is privileged or pro-
tected, will enable other parties to assess the
applicability of the privilege or protection. A
party must make a claim for privilege no
later than the due date to produce the infor-
mation.
(2) Information Produced as Inadvertent Dis-
closure; Sealing All or Part of the Record. If in-
formation produced in discovery is subject to
a claim of privilege or of protection as hear-
ing preparation material, the party making
the claim of privilege may notify any party
that received the information of the claim of
privilege and the basis for it. After being no-
tified, a party must promptly return, seques-
ter, or destroy the specified information and
any copies it has; must not use or disclose
the information until the claim of privilege
is resolved; must take reasonable steps to re-
trieve the information if the party disclosed
it before being notified; and may promptly
present the information to the Merits Hear-
ing Officer or the Board under seal for a de-
termination of the claim of privilege. The
producing party must preserve the informa-
tion until the claim of privilege is resolved.
§ 6.02 Request for Subpoena.
(a) Authority to Issue Subpoenas. At the re-
quest of a party, the Merits Hearing Officer
may issue subpoenas for the attendance and
testimony of witnesses and for the produc-
tion of correspondence, books, papers, docu-
ments, or other records. The attendance of
witnesses and the production of records may
be required from any place within the United
States. However, no subpoena shall be issued
for the attendance or testimony of an em-
ployee or agent of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights (including but not
limited to a Board member, the Executive
Director, the General Counsel, a Confidential
Advisor, a mediator, a hearing officer, or un-
paid staff), or for the production of files,
records, or notes produced during the con-
fidential advising process, in mediation, or
at the hearing. Employing offices shall make
their employees available for discovery and
hearing without requiring a subpoena.
* * * * *
(b) Request. A request to issue a subpoena
requiring the attendance and testimony of
witnesses or the production of documents or
other evidence under paragraph (a) above
shall be submitted to the Merits Hearing Of-
ficer at least 15 days before the scheduled
hearing date. If the subpoena is sought as
part of the discovery process, the request
shall be submitted to the Merits Hearing Of-
ficer at least 10 days before the date that a
witness must attend a deposition or the date
for the production of documents. The Merits
Hearing Officer may waive the time limits
stated above for good cause.
(c) Forms and Showing. Requests for sub-
poenas shall be submitted in writing to the
Merits Hearing Officer and shall specify with
particularity the witness, correspondence,
books, papers, documents, or other records
desired and shall be supported by a showing
of general relevance and reasonable scope.
(d) Rulings. The Merits Hearing Officer
shall promptly rule on subpoena requests.

S2344 April 9, 2019
§ 6.03 Service.
Subpoenas shall be served in the manner
provided under Rule 45(b) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Service of a sub-
poena may be made by any person who is
over 18 years of age and is not a party to the
proceeding.
§ 6.04 Proof of Service.
When service of a subpoena is effected, the
person serving the subpoena shall certify the
date and the manner of service. The party on
whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall
file the server’s certification with the Merits
Hearing Officer.
§ 6.05 Motion to Quash or Limit.
Any person against whom a subpoena is di-
rected may file a motion to quash or limit
the subpoena setting forth the reasons why
the subpoena should not be complied with or
why it should be limited in scope. This mo-
tion shall be filed with the Merits Hearing
Officer before the time specified in the sub-
poena for compliance and not later than 10
days after service of the subpoena. The Mer-
its Hearing Officer should promptly rule on a
motion to quash or limit and ensure that the
person receiving the subpoena is made aware
of the ruling.
§ 6.06 Enforcement.
(a) Objections and Requests for Enforcement.
If a person has been served with a subpoena
pursuant to section 6.03 of the Rules, but
fails or refuses to comply with its terms or
otherwise objects to it, the party or person
objecting or the party seeking compliance
may seek a ruling from the Merits Hearing
Officer. The request for a ruling shall be sub-
mitted in writing to the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer. However, it may be made orally on the
record at the hearing at the discretion of the
Merits Hearing Officer. The party seeking
compliance shall present the proof of service
and, except when the witness was required to
appear before the Merits Hearing Officer,
shall submit evidence, by affidavit or dec-
laration, of the failure or refusal to obey the
subpoena.
(b) Ruling by the Merits Hearing Officer.
(1) The Merits Hearing Officer shall
promptly rule on the request for enforce-
ment and/or the objection(s).
(2) On request of the objecting witness or
any party, the Merits Hearing Officer shall—
or on the Hearing Officer’s own initiative,
the Hearing Officer may—refer the ruling to
the Board for review.
(c) Review by the Board. The Board may
overrule, modify, remand, or affirm the Mer-
its Hearing Officer’s ruling and, in its discre-
tion, may direct the General Counsel to
apply in the name of the Office for an order
from a United States district court to en-
force the subpoena.
(d) Application to an Appropriate Court; Civil
Contempt. If a person fails to comply with a
subpoena, the Board may direct the General
Counsel to apply, in the name of the Office,
to an appropriate United States district
court for an order requiring that person to
appear before the Merits Hearing Officer to
give testimony or produce records. Any fail-
ure to obey a lawful order of the district
court may be held by such court to be a civil
contempt thereof.
§ 6.07 Requirements for Sworn Statements.
Any time that the Office and/or a Hearing
Officer requires an affidavit or sworn state-
ment from a party or a witness, he or she
should refer the party or witness to a sample
declaration under 28 U.S.C. § 1746, which sub-
stantially requires:
(a) If executed within the United States,
its territories, possessions, or common-
wealths: ‘‘I declare (or certify, verify, or
state) under penalty of perjury that the fore-
going is true and correct. Executed on (date).
(Signature).’’
(b) If executed outside the United States:
‘‘I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under
penalty of perjury under the laws of the
United States of America that the foregoing
is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Sig-
nature).’’
SUBPART G—[AMENDED]
[Table of Contents Omitted]
Revise subpart G to read as follows:
§ 7.01 The Merits Hearing Officer.
This subpart concerns the duties and re-
sponsibilities of Merits Hearing Officers, who
are appointed by the Executive Director to
preside over the administrative hearings
under the Act. The duties and responsibil-
ities of Preliminary Hearing Officers are
contained in section 5.08 of these Rules.

ing Officer may exercise authority as pro-
vided in subparagraph (b) of this section
upon his or her own initiative or upon a par-
ty’s motion, as appropriate.

(1) administer oaths and affirmations;

representatives;
(3) issue subpoenas in accordance with sec-
tion 6.02 of these Rules;

evant evidence;

priate under sections 6.01 to 6.06 of these
Rules;
(6) hold prehearing conferences for simpli-
fying issues and settlement;
(7) convene a hearing, as appropriate, regu-
late the course of the hearing, and maintain
decorum at and exclude from the hearing
any person who disrupts, or threatens to dis-
rupt, that decorum;
(8) exclude from the hearing any person,
except any claimant, any party, the attorney
or representative of any claimant or party,
or any witness while testifying;
(9) rule on all motions, witness and exhibit
lists, and proposed findings, including mo-
tions for summary judgment;
(10) require the filing of briefs, memoranda
of law, and the presentation of oral argu-
ment as to any question of fact or law;
(11) order the production of evidence and
the appearance of witnesses;
(12) impose sanctions as provided under
section 7.02 of these Rules;
(13) file decisions on the issues presented at
the hearing;
(14) dismiss any claim that is found to be
frivolous or that fails to state a claim upon
which relief may be granted;
(15) maintain and enforce the confiden-
tiality of proceedings; and
(16) waive or modify any procedural re-
quirements of subparts F and G of these
Rules so long as permitted by the Act.
§ 7.02 Sanctions.
(a) When necessary to regulate the course
of the proceedings (including the hearing),
the Merits Hearing Officer may impose an
appropriate sanction, which may include,
but is not limited to, the sanctions specified
in this section, on the parties and/or their
representatives.
(b) The Merits Hearing Officer may impose
sanctions upon the parties and/or their rep-
resentatives based on, but not limited to, the
circumstances set forth in this section.
(1) Failure to Comply with an Order. When a
party fails to comply with an order (includ-
ing an order to submit to a deposition, to
produce evidence within the party’s control,
or to produce witnesses), the Merits Hearing
Officer may:
(A) draw an inference in favor of the re-
questing party on the issue related to the in-
formation sought;
(B) stay further proceedings until the order
is obeyed;
(C) prohibit the party failing to comply
with such order from introducing evidence
concerning, or otherwise relying upon, evi-
dence relating to the information sought;
(D) permit the requesting party to intro-
duce secondary evidence concerning the in-
formation sought;
(E) strike, in whole or in part, the claim,
briefs, answer, or other submissions of the
party failing to comply with the order, as ap-
propriate; or
(F) direct judgment against the non-com-
plying party in whole or in part.
(2) Failure to Prosecute or Defend. If a party
fails to prosecute or defend a position, the
Merits Hearing Officer may dismiss the ac-
tion with prejudice or decide the matter,
when appropriate.
(3) Failure to Make Timely Filing. The Mer-
its Hearing Officer may refuse to consider
any request, motion or other action that is
not filed in a timely fashion in compliance
with this subpart.
(4) Frivolous Claims, Defenses, and Argu-
ments. If a party or a representative files a
claim that fails to meet the requirements of
section 401(f) of the Act, the Merits Hearing
Officer may dismiss the claim, in whole or in
part, with prejudice or decide the matter for
the opposing party. If a party or a represent-
ative presents a pleading, written motion, or
other paper containing claims, defenses, and
other legal contentions for any improper
purpose, such as to harass, cause unneces-
sary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of
resolution of the matter, the Merits Hearing
Officer may reject the claims, defenses or
legal contentions, in whole or in part. A
claim, defense, or legal contention shall not
be subject to sanctions if it constitutes a
nonfrivolous argument for extending, modi-
fying, or reversing existing law or for estab-
lishing new law.
(5) Failure to Maintain Confidentiality. An
allegation regarding a violation of the con-
fidentiality provisions may be made to a
Merits Hearing Officer in proceedings under
section 405 of the Act. If, after notice and
hearing, the Merits Hearing Officer deter-
mines that a party has violated the confiden-
tiality provisions, the Merits Hearing Officer
may:
(A) direct that the matters related to the
breach of confidentiality or other designated
facts be taken as established for purposes of
the action, as the prevailing party contends;
(B) prohibit the party breaching confiden-
tiality from supporting or opposing des-
ignated claims or defenses, or from intro-
ducing designated matters in evidence;
(C) strike the pleadings in whole or in part;
(D) stay further proceedings until the
breach of confidentiality is resolved to the
extent possible;
(E) dismiss the action or proceeding in
whole or in part; or
(F) render a default judgment against the
party breaching confidentiality.
(c) No sanctions may be imposed under this
section except for good cause and the par-
ticulars of which must be stated in the sanc-
tion order.
§ 7.03 Disqualifying a Merits Hearing Officer.
(a) In the event that a Merits Hearing Offi-
cer considers himself or herself disqualified,
either because of personal bias or of an inter-
est in the case or for some other disquali-
fying reason, he or she shall withdraw from

the case, stating in writing or on the record
the reasons for his or her withdrawal, and
shall immediately notify the Office of the
withdrawal.
(b) Any party may file a motion requesting
that a Merits Hearing Officer withdraw on
the basis of personal bias or of an interest in
the case or for some other disqualifying rea-
son. This motion shall specifically set forth
the reasons supporting the request and be
filed as soon as the party has reason to be-
lieve that there is a basis for disqualifica-
tion.
(c) The Merits Hearing Officer shall
promptly rule on the withdrawal motion. If
the motion is granted, the Executive Direc-
tor will appoint another Merits Hearing Offi-
cer within 5 days. Any objection to the Mer-
its Hearing Officer’s ruling on the with-
drawal motion shall not be deemed waived
by a party’s further participation in the
hearing and may be the basis for an appeal
to the Board from the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer’s decision under section 8.01 of these
Rules. Such objection will not stay the con-
duct of the hearing.
§ 7.04 Motions and Prehearing Conference.
(a) Motions. Motions shall be filed with the
Merits Hearing Officer and shall be in writ-
ing except for oral motions made on the
record during the hearing. All written mo-
tions and any responses to them shall in-
clude a proposed order, when applicable.
Only with the Merits Hearing Officer’s ad-
vance approval may either party file addi-
tional responses to the motion or to the re-
sponse to the motion. Motions for extension
of time will be granted only for good cause
shown.
(b) Scheduling the Prehearing Conference.
Within 7 days after a Merits Hearing Officer
is assigned to adjudicate the claim(s), the
Merits Hearing Officer shall serve on the par-
ties and their designated representatives
written notice setting forth the time, date,
and place of the prehearing conference, ex-
cept that the Executive Director may, for
good cause, extend up to an additional 7 days
the time for serving notice of the prehearing
conference.
(c) Prehearing Conference Memoranda. The
Merits Hearing Officer may order each party
to prepare a prehearing conference memo-
randum. The Merits Hearing Officer may di-
rect that a memorandum be filed after dis-
covery has concluded. The memorandum
may include:
(1) the major factual contentions and legal
issues that the party intends to raise at the
hearing in short, successive, and numbered
paragraphs, along with any proposed stipula-
tions of fact or law;
(2) an estimate of the time necessary for
presenting the party’s case;
(3) the specific relief, including, when
known, a calculation of any monetary relief
or damages that is being or will be re-
quested;
(4) the names of potential witnesses for the
party’s case, except for potential impeach-
ment or rebuttal witnesses, and the purpose
for which they will be called and a list of
documents that the party is seeking from
the opposing party, and, if discovery was per-
mitted, the status of any pending request for
discovery. (It is not necessary to list each
document requested. Instead, the party may
refer to the request for discovery.); and
(5) a brief description of any other unre-
solved issues.
(d) At the prehearing conference, the Mer-
its Hearing Officer may discuss the subjects
specified in paragraph (c) above and the
manner in which the hearing will be con-
ducted. In addition, the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer may explore settlement possibilities and
consider how the factual and legal issues
might be simplified and any other issues
that might expedite resolving the dispute.
The Merits Hearing Officer shall issue an
order, which recites the actions taken at the
conference and the parties’ agreements as to
any matters considered, and which limits the
issues to those not disposed of by the parties’
admissions, stipulations, or agreements.
Such order, when entered, shall control the
course of the proceeding, subject to later
modification by the Merits Hearing Officer
by his or her own motion or upon proper re-
quest of a party for good cause shown.
§ 7.05 Scheduling the Hearing.
(a) Date, Time, and Place of Hearing. The Of-
fice shall issue the notice of hearing, which
shall fix the date, time, and place of hearing.
Absent a postponement granted by the Of-
fice, a hearing must commence no later than
60 days after the filing of the claim(s).
(b) Motions for Postponement or a Continu-
ance. Motions for postponement or for a con-
tinuance by either party shall be made in
writing to the Merits Hearing Officer, shall
set forth the reasons for the request, and
shall state whether or not the opposing party
consents to such postponement. A Merits
Hearing Officer may grant such a motion
upon a showing of good cause. In no event
will a hearing commence later than 90 days
after the filing of the claim form.
§ 7.06 Consolidation and Joinder of Cases.
(a) Explanation.
(1) Consolidation is when two or more par-
ties have cases that might be treated as one
because they contain identical or similar
issues or in such other appropriate cir-
cumstances.
(2) Joinder is when one party has two or
more cases pending and they are united for
consideration. For example, joinder might be
warranted when a single party has one case
pending challenging a 30–day suspension and
another case pending challenging a subse-
quent dismissal.
(b) Authority. The Executive Director (be-
fore assigning a Merits Hearing Officer to ad-
judicate a claim); a Merits Hearing Officer
(during the hearing); or the Board (during an
appeal) may consolidate or join cases on
their own initiative or on the motion of a
party if to do so would expedite case proc-
essing and not adversely affect the parties’
interests, taking into account the confiden-
tiality requirements of section 416 of the
Act.
§ 7.07 Conduct of Hearing; Disqualifying a
Representative.
(a) Pursuant to section 405(d)(1) of the Act,
the Merits Hearing Officer shall conduct the
hearing in closed session on the record. Only
the Merits Hearing Officer, the parties and
their representatives, and witnesses during
the time they are testifying, shall be per-
mitted to attend the hearing, except that the
Office may not be precluded from observing
the hearing. The Merits Hearing Officer, or a
person designated by the Merits Hearing Of-
ficer or the Executive Director, shall record
the proceedings.
(b) The hearing shall be conducted as an
administrative proceeding. Witnesses shall
testify under oath or affirmation. Except as
specified in the Act and in these Rules, the
Merits Hearing Officer shall conduct the
hearing, to the greatest extent practicable,
consistent with the principles and proce-
dures in sections 554 through 557 of title 5 of
the United States Code (the Administrative
Procedure Act).
(c) No later than the opening of the hear-
ing, or as otherwise ordered by the Merits
Hearing Officer, each party shall submit to
the Merits Hearing Officer and to the oppos-
ing party typed lists of the hearing exhibits
and the witnesses expected to be called to
testify, excluding impeachment or rebuttal
witnesses.
(d) At the commencement of the hearing,
or as otherwise ordered by the Merits Hear-
ing Officer, the Merits Hearing Officer may
consider any stipulations of facts and law
pursuant to section 7.10 of the Rules, take of-
ficial notice of certain facts pursuant to sec-
tion 7.11 of the Rules, rule on the parties’ ob-
jections and hear witness testimony. Each
party must present his or her case in a con-
cise manner, limiting the testimony of wit-
nesses and submission of documents to rel-
evant matters.
(e) Any evidentiary objection not timely
made before a Merits Hearing Officer shall,
absent clear error, be deemed waived on ap-
peal to the Board.
(f) Failure of either party to appear at the
hearing, to present witnesses, or to respond
to an evidentiary order may result in an ad-
verse finding or ruling by the Merits Hearing
Officer. At the Merits Hearing Officer’s dis-
cretion, the hearing also may be held with-
out the claimant if the claimant’s represent-
ative is present.
(g) If the Merits Hearing Officer concludes
that an employee’s representative, a witness,
a charging party, a labor organization, an
employing office, or an entity alleged to be
responsible for correcting a violation has a
conflict of interest, the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer may, after giving the representative an
opportunity to respond, disqualify the rep-
resentative. In that event, within the time
limits for hearing and decision established
by the Act, the affected party shall be af-
forded reasonable time to retain other rep-
resentation.
§ 7.08 Transcript.
(a) Preparation. The Office shall keep an ac-
curate electronic or stenographic hearing
record, which shall be the sole official record
of the proceeding. The Office shall be respon-
sible for the cost of transcribing the hearing.
Upon request, a copy of the hearing tran-
script shall be furnished to each party, pro-
vided, however, that such party has first
agreed to maintain and respect the confiden-
tiality of such transcript in accordance with
the applicable rules prescribed by the Office
or the Merits Hearing Officer to effectuate
section 416(b) of the Act. Additional copies of
transcripts shall be made available to a
party at the party’s expense. The Office may
grant exceptions to the payment require-
ment for good cause shown. A motion for an
exception shall be made in writing, accom-
panied by an affidavit or a declaration set-
ting forth the reasons for the request, and
submitted to the Office. Requests for copies
of transcripts also shall be directed to the
Office. The Office may, by agreement with
the person making the request, arrange with
the official hearing reporter for required
services to be charged to the requester.
(b) Corrections. Corrections to the official
transcript of the hearing will be permitted.
Motions for correction must be submitted
within 10 days of service of the transcript
upon the parties. Corrections to the official
transcript will be permitted only upon the
approval of the Merits Hearing Officer. The
Merits Hearing Officer may make correc-
tions at any time with notice to the parties.
§ 7.09 Admissibility of Evidence.
The Merits Hearing Officer shall apply the
Federal Rules of Evidence to the greatest ex-
tent practicable. These Rules provide, among
other things, that the Merits Hearing Officer
may exclude evidence if, among other things,
it constitutes inadmissible hearsay or its
probative value is substantially outweighed
by the danger of unfair prejudice, by confu-
sion of the issues, or by considerations of
undue delay, waste of time, or needless pres-
entation of cumulative evidence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2346 April 9, 2019
§ 7.10 Stipulations.
The parties may stipulate as to any matter
of fact. Such a stipulation will satisfy a par-
ty’s burden of proving the fact alleged.
§ 7.11 Official Notice.
(a) The Merits Hearing Officer on his or her
own motion or on motion of a party, may
take official notice of a fact that is not sub-
ject to reasonable dispute because it is ei-
ther:
(1) a matter of common knowledge; or
(2) capable of accurate and ready deter-
mination by resort to sources whose accu-
racy cannot reasonably be questioned. Offi-
cial notice taken of any fact satisfies a par-
ty’s burden of proving the fact noticed.
(b) When a decision, or part thereof, rests
on the official notice of a material fact not
appearing in the evidence in the record, the
fact of official notice shall be so stated in
the decision, and any party, upon timely re-
quest, shall be afforded an opportunity to
show the contrary.
§ 7.12 Confidentiality.
(a) Pursuant to section 416 of the Act and
section 1.08 of these Rules, all proceedings
and deliberations of Merits Hearing Officers
and the Board, including the hearing tran-
scripts and any related records, shall be con-
fidential, except as specified in sections
416(c), (d), (e), and (f) of the Act and subpara-
graph 1.08(d) of these Rules. All parties to
the proceeding and their representatives, and
witnesses who appear at the hearing, will be
advised of the importance of confidentiality
in this process and of their obligations, sub-
ject to sanctions, to maintain it. This provi-
sion shall not apply to proceedings under
section 215 of the Act, but shall apply to the
Merits Hearing Officers’ and the Board’s de-
liberations under that section.
(b) Violation of Confidentiality. A Merits
Hearing Officer, under section 405 of the Act,
may resolve an alleged violation of confiden-
tiality that occurred during a hearing. After
providing notice and an opportunity to the
parties to be heard, the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer, under subparagraph 1.08(f) of these
Rules, may find a violation of confiden-
tiality and impose appropriate procedural or
evidentiary sanctions, to include the sanc-
tions listed in section 7.02 of these Rules.
§ 7.13 Immediate Board Review of a Hearing
Officer’s Ruling.
(a) Review Strongly Disfavored. Board review
of a Merits Hearing Officer’s ruling is strong-
ly disfavored while a proceeding is ongoing
(an ‘‘interlocutory appeal’’). In general, the
Board may consider a request for interlocu-
tory appeal only if the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer, on his or her own motion or by motion
of the parties, determines that the issue pre-
sented is of such importance to the pro-
ceeding that it requires the Board’s imme-
diate attention.
(b) Time for Filing. A party must file a mo-
tion for interlocutory appeal of a Merits
Hearing Officer’s ruling with the Merits
Hearing Officer within 5 days after service of
the ruling upon the parties. The motion shall
include arguments in support of both inter-
locutory appeal and the requested deter-
mination to be made by the Board upon re-
view. Responses, if any, shall be filed with
the Hearing Officer within 3 days after serv-
ice of the motion.
(c) Standards for Review. In determining
whether to certify and forward a request for
interlocutory appeal to the Board, the Mer-
its Hearing Officer shall consider the fol-
lowing:
(1) whether the ruling involves a signifi-
cant question of law or policy about which
there is substantial ground for difference of
opinion;
(2) whether an immediate Board review of
the Merits Hearing Officer’s ruling will ma-
terially advance completing the proceeding;
and
(3) whether denial of immediate review will
cause undue harm to a party or the public.
(d) Merits Hearing Officer Action. If all the
conditions set forth in paragraph (c) above
are met, the Merits Hearing Officer shall cer-
tify and forward a request for interlocutory
appeal to the Board for its immediate con-
sideration. Any such submission shall ex-
plain the basis on which the Merits Hearing
Officer concluded that the standards in para-
graph (c) have been met. The Merits Hearing
Officer’s decision to forward or decline to
forward a request for review is not appeal-
able.
(e) Granting or Denying an Interlocutory Ap-
peal is Within the Board’s Sole Discretion. The
Board, in its sole discretion, may grant or
deny an interlocutory appeal, upon the Mer-
its Hearing Officer’s certification and deci-
sion to forward a request for review. The
Board’s decision to grant or deny an inter-
locutory appeal is not appealable.
(f) Stay Pending Interlocutory Appeal. Unless
otherwise directed by the Board, the stay of
any proceedings during the pendency of ei-
ther a request for interlocutory appeal or the
appeal itself shall be within the Merits Hear-
ing Officer’s discretion, provided that no
stay shall serve to toll the time limits set
forth in section 405(d) of the Act. If the Mer-
its Hearing Officer does not stay the pro-
ceedings, the Board may do so while an in-
terlocutory appeal is pending with it.
(g) Procedures before the Board. Upon its de-
cision to grant interlocutory appeal, the
Board shall issue an order setting forth the
procedures that will be followed in the con-
duct of that review.
(h) Appeal of a Final Decision. Denial of in-
terlocutory appeal will not affect a party’s
right to challenge rulings, which are other-
wise appealable, as part of an appeal to the
Board under section 8.01 of the Rules from
the Merits Hearing Officer’s decision issued
under section 7.16 of these Rules.
§ 7.14 Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclu-
sions of Law; Posthearing Briefs.
May be Required. The Merits Hearing Offi-
cer may require the parties to file proposed
findings of fact and conclusions of law and/or
posthearing briefs on the factual and the
legal issues presented in the case.
§ 7.15 Closing the Record.
(a) Except as provided in section 7.14 of the
Rules, the record shall close when the hear-
ing ends. However, the Hearing Officer may
hold the record open as necessary to allow
the parties to submit arguments, briefs, doc-
uments or additional evidence previously
identified for introduction.
(b) Once the record is closed, no additional
evidence or argument shall be accepted into
the hearing record except upon a showing
that new and material evidence has become
available that was not available despite due
diligence before the record closed or that the
additional evidence or argument is being
provided in rebuttal to new evidence or argu-
ment that the other party submitted just be-
fore the record closed. The Merits Hearing
Officer also shall make part of the record an
approved correction to the transcript.
§ 7.16 Merits Hearing Officer Decisions; Entry
in Office Records; Corrections to the
Record; Motions to Alter, Amend, or Va-
cate the Decision.
(a) The Merits Hearing Officer shall issue a
written decision no later than 90 days after
the hearing ends, pursuant to section 405(g)
of the Act.
(b) The Merits Hearing Officer’s written de-
cision shall:
(1) state the issues raised in the claim(s),
form, or complaint;
(2) describe the evidence in the record;
(3) contain findings of fact and conclusions
of law, and the reasons or bases therefore, on
all the material issues of fact, law, or discre-
tion presented on the record;
(4) determine whether a violation has oc-
curred; and
(5) order such remedies as are appropriate
under the Act.
(c) If a final decision concerns a claim al-
leging a violation or violations described in
section 415(d)(1)(C) of the Act, the written
decision shall include the following findings:
(1) whether the alleged violation or viola-
tions occurred;
(2) whether any violation or violations
found to have occurred were committed per-
sonally by an individual who, at the time of
committing the violation, was a Member of
the House of Representatives (including a
Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the
Congress) or a Senator;
(3) the amount of compensatory damages,
if any, awarded pursuant to section
415(d)(1)(B) of the Act; and
(4) the amount, if any, of compensatory
damages that is the ‘‘reimbursable portion’’
as defined by section 415(d) of the Act.
(d) Upon issuance, the Merits Hearing Offi-
cer’s decision and order shall be entered into
the Office’s records.
(e) The Office shall promptly provide a
copy of the Merits Hearing Officer’s decision
and order to the parties.
(f) If there is no appeal of a Merits Hearing
Officer’s decision and order, that decision be-
comes a final decision of the Office, which is
subject to enforcement under section 8.03 of
these Rules.
(g) Corrections to the Record. After a Merits
Hearing Officer’s decision has been issued,
but before an appeal is made to the Board, or
absent an appeal, before the decision be-
comes final, the Merits Hearing Officer may
issue an erratum notice to correct simple er-
rors or easily correctible mistakes. The Mer-
its Hearing Officer may do so on the parties’
motion or on his or her own motion with or
without advance notice.
(h) After a Merits Hearing Officer’s deci-
sion has been issued, but before an appeal is
made to the Board, or absent an appeal, be-
fore the decision becomes final, a party to
the proceeding before the Merits Hearing Of-
ficer may move to alter, amend, or vacate
the decision. The moving party must estab-
lish that relief from the decision is war-
ranted because: (1) of mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) there is
newly discovered evidence that, with reason-
able diligence, could not have been discov-
ered in time to move for a new hearing; (3)
there has been fraud (misrepresentation, or
misconduct by an opposing party); (4) the de-
cision is void; or (5) the decision has been
satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based
on an earlier decision that has been reversed
or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no
longer equitable. The motion shall be filed
within 15 days after service of the Merits
Hearing Officer’s decision. No response shall
be filed unless the Merits Hearing Officer so
orders. The filing and pendency of a motion
under this provision shall not relieve a party
of the obligation to file a timely appeal or
operate to stay the Merits Hearing Officer’s
action unless the Merits Hearing Officer so
orders.

SUBPART I—[AMENDED]
[Table of Contents Omitted]
1. Amend section 9.01 by:
(a) Revising paragraph (a); and
(b) Adding a new paragraph (c).
The revisions read as follows:
§ 9.01 Attorney’s Fees and Costs.
(a) Request. No later than 30 days after the
entry of a final decision of the Office, the
prevailing party may submit to the Merits
Hearing Officer who decided the case a mo-
tion for the award of reasonable attorney’s
fees and costs, following the form specified
in paragraph (b) below. The Merits Hearing
Officer, after giving the respondent an oppor-
tunity to reply, shall rule on the motion. De-
cisions regarding attorney’s fees and costs
are collateral and do not affect the finality
or appealability of a final decision issued by
the Office.
* * * * *
(c) Arbitration Awards. In arbitration pro-
ceedings, the prevailing party must submit
any request for attorney’s fees and costs to
the arbitrator in accordance with the estab-
lished arbitration procedures.
2. Amend section 9.02 by revising paragraph
(b) as follows:
§ 9.02 Ex Parte Communications.
* * * * *
(b) Exception to Coverage. The Rules set
forth in this section do not apply during pe-
riods that the Board designates as periods of
negotiated rulemaking in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Administra-
tive Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq.
* * * * *
3. Revise section 9.03 as follows:
§ 9.03 Informal Resolutions and Settlement
Agreements.
(a) Informal Resolution. At any time before
a covered employee files a claim form under
section 402 of the Act, a covered employee
and the employing office, on their own, may
agree voluntarily and informally to resolve a
dispute. Any informal resolution shall be in-
effective to the extent that it purports to:
(1) constitute a waiver of a covered em-
ployee’s rights under the Act; or
(2) create an obligation that is payable
from the account established by section
415(a) of the Act (‘‘Section 415(a) Treasury
Account’’) or enforceable by the Office.
(b) * * * * *
(c) General Requirements for Formal Settle-
ment Agreements. A formal settlement agree-
ment must contain the signatures of all par-
ties or their designated representatives on
the agreement document. A formal settle-
ment agreement cannot be approved by the
Executive Director until the appropriate rev-
ocation periods have expired and the employ-
ing office has fully completed and submitted
the Office’s Section 415(a) Account Requisi-
tion Form. A formal settlement agreement
cannot be rescinded after the signatures of
all parties have been affixed to the agree-
ment, unless by written revocation of the
agreement voluntarily signed by all parties,
or as otherwise permitted by law. All formal
settlement agreements must also:
(1) specify the amount of each payment to
be made from the Section 415(a) Treasury
Account;
(2) identify the portion of any payment
that is subject to the reimbursement provi-
sions of section 415(e) of the Act because it is
being used to settle an alleged violation of
section 201(a) or 206(a) of the Act;
(3) identify each payment that is back pay
and indicate the net amount that will be
paid to the employee after tax withholding
and authorized deductions; and
(4) certify that, except for funds to correct
alleged violations of sections 201(a)(3), 210, or
215 of the Act, only funds from the Section
415(a) Treasury Account will be used for the
payment of any amount specified in the set-
tlement agreement.
(d) Requirements for Formal Settlement Agree-
ments Involving Claims against Members of
Congress. If a formal settlement agreement
concerns allegations against a Member of
Congress subject to the payment reimburse-
ment provisions of section 415(d) of the Act,
the settlement agreement must comply with
subparagraphs 9.03(c)(1), (3) and (4) of these
Rules, and:
(1) specify the amount, if any, that is the
‘‘reimbursable portion’’ as defined by section
415(d) of the Act; and
(2) contain the signature of any individual
(or the representative of any individual) who
has exercised his or her right to intervene
pursuant to section 414(d)(8) of the Act.
(e) * * * * *
3. Revise section 9.04 as follows:
§ 9.04 Payments Required Pursuant to Deci-
sions, Awards, or Settlements under Sec-
tion 415(a) of the Act.
(a) In General. Whenever an award or set-
tlement requires the payment of funds pur-
suant to section 415(a) of the Act, the award
or settlement must be submitted to the Ex-
ecutive Director together with a fully com-
pleted Section 415(a) Account Requisition
Form for processing by the Office.
(b) Requesting Payments.
(1) Only an employing office under section
101 of the Act may submit a payment request
from the Section 415(a) Treasury Account.
(2) Employing offices must submit requests
for payments from the Section 415(a) Treas-
ury Account on the Office’s Section 415(a)
Account Requisition Forms.
(c) Duty to Cooperate. Each employment of-
fice has a duty to cooperate with the Execu-
tive Director or his or her designee by
promptly responding to any requests for in-
formation and to otherwise assist the Execu-
tive Director in providing prompt payments
from the Section 415(a) Treasury Account.
Failure to cooperate may be grounds for dis-
approval of the settlement agreement.
(d) Back Pay. When the award or settle-
ment specifies a payment as back pay, the
gross amount of the back pay will be paid to
the employing office and the employing of-
fice will then promptly issue amounts rep-
resenting back pay (and interest if author-
ized) to the employee and retain amounts
representing withholding and deductions.
(e) Attorney’s fees. When the award or set-
tlement specifies a payment as attorney’s
fees, the attorney’s fees are paid directly to
the attorney from the Section 415(a) Treas-
ury Account.
(f) Tax Reporting and Withholding Obliga-
tions. The Office does not report Section
415(a) Treasury Account payments as poten-
tial taxable income to the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) and is not responsible for tax
withholding or reporting. To the extent that
W–2 or 1099 forms need to be issued, it is the
responsibility of the employing office sub-
mitting the payment request to do so. The
employing office should also consult IRS
regulations for guidance in reporting the
amount of any back pay award as wages on
a W–2 Form.
(g) Method of Payment. Section 415(a)
Treasury Account payments are made by
electronic funds transfer. The Office will
issue an electronic payment to the payee’s
account as specified on the appropriate Sec-
tion 415(a) Treasury Account form.
(h) Reimbursement of the Section 415(a)
Treasury Account.
(1) Members of Congress. Section 415(d) of
the Act requires Members of the House of
Representatives and the Senate to reimburse
the ‘‘compensatory damages’’ portion of a
decision, award or settlement for a violation
of section 201(a), 206(a), or 207 that the Mem-
ber is found to have ‘‘committed person-
ally.’’ Reimbursement shall be in accordance
with the timetable and procedures estab-
lished by the applicable congressional com-
mittee for the withholding of amounts from
the compensation of an individual who is a
Member of the House of Representatives or a
Senator.
(2) Other Employing Offices. Section 415(e) of
the Act requires employing offices (other
than an employing office of the House or
Senate) to reimburse awards and settlements
paid from the Section 415(a) Treasury Ac-
count in connection with claims alleging
violations of section 201(a) or 206(a) of the
Act.
(A) As soon as practicable after the Execu-
tive Director is made aware that a payment
of an award or settlement under this Act has
been made from the Section 415(a) Treasury
Account in connection with a claim alleging
a violation of section 201(a) or 206(a) of the
Act by an employing office (other than an
employing office of the House of Representa-
tives or an employing office of the Senate),
the Executive Director will notify the head
of the employing office that the payment has
been made. The notice will include a state-
ment of the payment amount.
(B) Reimbursement must be made within
180 days after receipt of notice from the Ex-
ecutive Director, and is to be transferred to
the Section 415(a) Treasury Account out of
funds available for the employing office’s op-
erating expenses.

TRIBUTE TO LARA YERETSIAN—
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
WOMAN OF THE YEAR
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference
in my Congressional District. I would like to
recognize a remarkable woman, Lara
Yeretsian of Hollywood, California.
Before moving to the United States, Lara
and her family experienced hardship during
the civil war in Lebanon. Her parents, who
were wholeheartedly devoted to giving Lara
and her three sisters a good life and a loving
home, established Sasoun Bakery, a re-
nowned Armenian bakery in the Little Armenia
area of Hollywood, and enrolled Lara and her
siblings in the local Armenian school. Lara
continued her education at Southwestern Law
School in Los Angeles, and received her J.D.
degree in 1997, followed by her LL.M. degree
in International and Comparative Law from
Georgetown University Law Center in 1998.
She interned for Judge Bert Glennon of the
Los Angeles County Superior Court in Cali-
fornia, and for Judge Robert M. Takasugi of
the United States District Court for the Central
District of California.
A well-respected and successful criminal de-
fense attorney, and fluent in English, Arme-
nian and Arabic, Lara spent a decade working
on various high-profile cases at the law firm of
Geragos & Geragos. Later, she founded her
own firm, Yeretsian Law, and continues to
work as an uplifting and compassionate guide
for her clients. Recognized as a Southern
California Super Lawyer for 2019, Lara’s pro-
fessionalism and achievements have not gone
unnoticed. In addition to her many accomplish-
ments as an attorney, Ms. Yeretsian has au-
thored numerous articles regarding issues that
impact the criminal justice system.
In spite of her tremendously successful ca-
reer, Lara never lost sight of her passion to
give back, and her benevolence, leadership
and advocacy are reflected in her philan-
thropic work in the community. Currently, she
serves on the Board of Directors of the Arme-
nian Bone Marrow Donor Registry and the Los
Angeles City College Foundation, and as co-
chair of the Hollywood chapter of the Arme-
nian National Committee of America. Ms.
Yeretsian also serves as chairperson of the
Police Permit Review Panel of the Los Ange-
les Police Commission.
Lara is married to Hratch Manuelian, and
they have two sons, David and Christopher.
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Lara
Yeretsian.
HONORING THE FALLBROOK UNION
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT
FOR SERVING OUR MILITARY
FAMILIES
HON. MIKE LEVIN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the students and faculty of
Fallbrook Union Elementary School District.
Last month, my staff met with administrators
from Fallbrook Union who brought dozens of
letters and drawings from the students of Mary
Fay Pendleton Elementary School. The stu-
dents shared what they liked most about their
school. Ashton said ‘‘I love PE, when we play
tug-of-war’’ while Alina said she loves Mary
Fay ‘‘because we have a great librarian and a
big library.’’ Taelin said that ‘‘at this school I
like to help people that do not have a friend
and help people in need.’’
Mary Fay serves military-connected stu-
dents living on Camp Pendleton Marine Corps
Base. These students have parents who are
serving their country on base or deployed
abroad. Mary Fay creates a safe learning en-
vironment for its students and encourages
them to dream and succeed.
These students are benefiting from a top-
notch public education at an Impact Aid
school. School districts across the country
cross into land owned by the Federal Govern-
ment, including military bases. These schools
must operate with less local revenue because
federal lands are exempt from local property
taxes. It is our responsibility to ensure that
schools like Mary Fay have the necessary re-
sources to succeed by including sufficient
funding for Impact Aid schools in the FY2020
budget. I was proud to join my colleagues in
calling for the Appropriations Committee to
support strong and continued funding for the
Impact Aid Program.
I am honored to represent Mary Fay Pen-
dleton Elementary School and I thank them for
serving our military community. I especially
want to thank the teachers of the entire
Fallbrook Union Elementary School District for
their heroic work and for encouraging their
students to engage in the democratic process
at a young age.

OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Sasha Bailey
for receiving the Adams County Mayors and
Commissioners Youth Award.
The Youth Award focuses on teenagers who
have overcome personal adversity and cre-
ated positive changes in their lives and their
community. The program provides businesses,
the community and civic leaders an oppor-
tunity to support young people in their commu-
nities and recognize their accomplishments.
Sasha is the perfect recipient for this award
because despite adversities and challenges,
she has become an inspiration and role model
for her peers.
The dedication and leadership demonstrated
by Sasha is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and
perseverance. It is essential students at all
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will
guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Sasha Bailey for this well-deserved recogni-

IN HONOR OF NATIONAL FORMER
POW RECOGNITION DAY AND
THE JANESVILLE 99
HON. BRYAN STEIL
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, today I rise in
honor of National Former POW Recognition
Day and the 77th anniversary of capture of
U.S. soldiers on the Bataan Peninsula in the
Philippines to the Imperial Japanese Army and
the beginning of the Bataan Death March.
In November 1941, 99 soldiers from my
hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin arrived on
the Bataan Peninsula. These soldiers were
known as the ‘‘Janesville 99’’ and composed
Company A of the U.S. Army 192nd GHQ
Light Tank Battalion. Less than three weeks
after arriving to the Philippines, on December
8, 1941, Imperial Japan attacked.
For the next four months, out-gunned and
under-supplied, sick and starving, these brave
Wisconsinites fought the Battle of Bataan
against a substantial Japanese invasion force.
On April 9th, they were captured, tortured, and
subjected to the Bataan Death March.
Only 35 of the original Janesville 99 re-
turned after the War. This is a solemn re-
minder of the bravery and selfless sacrifices
our service members make for our freedom. In
Downtown Janesville, there is memorial to

honor the Janesville 99. We must never forget
our local heroes.
When President Ronald Reagan created the
permanent National Former Prisoners of War
Recognition Day on April 9, he said: ‘‘. . . It
is truly fitting that America observe April 9 in
recognition of our former prisoners of war; that
date is the 46th anniversary of the day in 1942
when U.S. forces holding out on the Bataan
Peninsula in the Philippines were captured.
Later, as prisoners of war, these gallant Amer-
icans were subjected to the infamous Bataan
Death March and to other inhumane treatment
that killed thousands of them before they
could be liberated. In every conflict, brutality
has invariably been meted out to American
prisoners of war; on April 9 and every day, we
must remember with solemn pride and grati-
tude that valor and tenacity have ever been
our prisoners’ response.’’
Today, we recognize those who the fought
the impossible and endured the unimaginable
for freedom from tyranny and oppression. I
thank all our POWs for their sacrifice. May the
Janesville 99 rest in peace.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT
COLONEL LAWRENCE M. DOANE
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
thank Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence ‘‘Larry’’ M.
Doane for his distinguished service to the Na-
tion, especially while assigned to the National
Capitol Region.
Larry served in my office as a Defense Fel-
low from January 2016 to December 2016. He
worked diligently throughout his tenure, assist-
ing in the 2016 National Defense Authorization
Act process to ensure the continuation of our
national defense. Larry built enduring relation-
ships, making him an asset in representing the
people of California’s Eighth Congressional
District. In addition to working Defense policy,
Larry became an expert on Veterans policies.
In that capacity Larry demonstrated genuine
care for every person he interacted with and
he attacked every assignment to achieve swift
resolutions.
As a Legislative Liaison in the National
Guard Bureau Office of Legislative Liaisons
from January 2017 to April 2019, Larry served
as the lead liaison during a high-profile deci-
sion regarding stationing of four Army National
Guard Apache battalions. This issue contained
massive implications for Army Guard units,
their states, and their Congressional rep-
resentatives. Through direct engagements with
senior Army leaders, the Chairmen of the
Armed Services Committees, Professional
Staff, and individual Member offices, Larry dis-
tilled the varied and complex stakeholder posi-
tions into clear, actionable courses of action
for decision-makers to consider. This was
among the most poignant displays of Larry’s
ability to bridge communication between the
Department of Defense and Congress on a
complicated issue. Larry operated with ease in
a high-visibility, stressful environment.
As Lieutenant Colonel Doane’s time in this
assignment ends, he will continue his path as
a Citizen-Soldier and assume command of 1st
Squadron, 172nd Cavalry Regiment of the
Vermont National Guard’s 86th Infantry Bri-
gade Combat Team (Mountain). Larry is sup-
ported in his military career by his wife, Me-
lissa, and their four children. Please join me in
congratulating Lieutenant Colonel Doane on
his selection as a Battalion Commander and in
expressing our gratitude for his and his fam-
ily’s service to the Nation.

TRIBUTE TO LYNN ALVAREZ—28TH
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
WOMAN OF THE YEAR
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference
in my Congressional District. I would like to
recognize a remarkable woman, Lynn Alvarez
of the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles,
California.
Ms. Alvarez has a long and distinguished
career as a philanthropist, non-profit adminis-
trator, law professor, and legal activist. She
has helped both public and private institutions
advance and govern their own respective ini-
tiatives, helping them to prosper with her
unique expertise.
After Lynn earned a Juris Doctorate at the
University of California, Berkeley, she headed
off to New York City to join the litigation de-
partment of a major law firm, but soon realized
her passion was more aligned with public in-
terest law. She worked tirelessly as the legal
director of a community-based organization
representing Central American refugees, and
subsequently worked on the national level in
major class-action lawsuits representing the
rights of immigrants. As a professor at the
University of California, Los Angeles, Ms. Al-
varez taught courses on professional ethics
and immigration law.
Having served as a Board Member of non-
profit organizations including Human Rights
Watch, Para Los Niños, the Central American
Refugee Center, and the Los Angeles Edu-
cation Partnership, Lynn is known for her con-
sistent advocacy of human rights and dignity
for all people. Lynn was appointed to the
Board of Recreation and Parks Commis-
sioners by former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio
Villaraigosa and re-appointed as President of
the Commission by Mayor Eric Garcetti in
2013. The Commission’s jurisdiction includes
oversight and management of all park and
recreation sites, annexation of public land for
recreational reasons, and implementation of
legal contracts and obligations.
Lynn and her husband, Steve Nissan along
with their three wonderful sons enjoy the out-
door splendor of the City of Los Angeles
parks; most particularly her ‘‘backyard park,’’
Griffith Park.
I ask all Members to join me in honoring an
exceptional woman of California’s 28th Con-
gressional District, Lynn Alvarez.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SALLY G.
CARROLL
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, Sally G. Car-
roll was a trailblazer in law enforcement and
past president of the Newark Branch of the
NAACP. She dedicated her life to service.
Miss Carroll passed away on April 1, 2019.
During her 97 years on this earth, Miss Car-
roll was a pillar in New Jersey’s criminal jus-
tice system. She was one of the first African-
American women to become an officer in the
Newark Police Department. Miss Carroll later
transferred to the Essex County Sherriff’s Of-
fice, where she rose to the rank of detective.
Miss Carroll then became the first woman to
serve on the New Jersey Parole Board.
Throughout her lifetime of public service,
Miss Carroll was active in the Newark Branch
of the NAACP, where she served as President
from 1967 to 1974. She was an active trustee
of the Newark Museum and member of the
National Association of Negro Business and
Professional Women. Miss Carroll’s active
service to Newark, Essex County, and New
Jersey reflected her deep devotion to improv-
ing people’s lives.
I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring

WELCOMING PASTOR MACKEY TO
PILGRIM REST
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today alongside the Phoenix community to
usher in a new chapter of spiritual leadership
with the installation of Pastor Terry E. Mackey
to Pilgrim Rest Baptist Church in Phoenix, Ari-
zona.
I stood on this floor last year to honor the
life of Bishop Alexis Thomas, who served for
eighteen years as the Senior Pastor of Pilgrim
Rest until his passing in January 2018. I
worked alongside Bishop Thomas as a part of
My Brother’s Keeper, and I witnessed first-
hand Pilgrim Rest’s boundless growth under
his guidance.
The greatest testament to that leadership is
its longevity. Phoenix still feels Bishop Thom-
as’s reach through the ‘‘Word Center’’ edu-
cational facility he constructed, and other ef-
forts he oversaw: free light rail tickets for the
homeless, food packages for low income el-
ders, and free GED courses. I congratulate
Pilgrim Rest on upholding the momentum of
Bishop Thomas’s contributions in his absence
this past year.
Today, I have the opportunity to acknowl-
edge the new life Pilgrim Rest will breathe into
the Phoenix community in the coming years
as we welcome Reverend Terry Eugene Mac-
key as the church’s 11th pastor.
In Houston, Pastor Mackey served as the
Minister to Youth and Young Adults at Wheel-
er Avenue Baptist Church, one of the nation’s
largest predominantly African American
churches. He then served as the Pastor of
Riceville Mount Olive Baptist Church, where
he tripled attendance and renewed the com-
munity’s investment in religious life.
Pastor Mackey has demonstrated a lifelong
commitment to community service and leader-
ship, and his ambitions for Pilgrim Rest’s fu-
ture role in the lives of Phoenix residents are
promising. He will continue to expand the
church’s presence by ‘‘striving for higher
heights’’ in worship and membership, and
‘‘deeper depths’’ in discipleship and relation-
ships with God and the community.
Madam Speaker, I believe the greatest rev-
erence we can show our previous leaders—
the teachers who built the foundations upon
which we carry out our good work—is to build
higher, in the spirit of the work that came be-
fore, and with an eye towards what the future
needs of us. Pastor Mackey is a leader of just
such foresight, and the people of Phoenix will
be made a more diligent, faithful, and cohe-
sive community because of his place at Pil-
grim Rest.

today in recognition of John Bayliss of Bayliss
Boatworks from Wanchese, North Carolina.
John is the leader of a team who every day
applies their experience and unique craftsmen
touch in creating perfectly crafted vessels for
their unique clientele.
Bayliss Boatworks was established in 2002.
With a fishing background, self-motivated
John, and his team built the company from the
ground up. John and friends were able to
draw up a number of contacts from the
sportfishing community to begin their brand-
new shop to create their exquisite boats used
for fishing, travel and entertainment. John
turned his passion into a profession. Since the
establishment of the company, Bayliss
Boatworks has risen to become one of the
premier boat craftsmen in the world. I am for-
tunate to have known John for many years
and be witness to the dedication he has for
his family, colleagues, and Bayliss Boatworks.
John is a visionary who is focused on the fin-
est craftsmanship and assuring that the details
of quality boatbuilding are central in the work
done in all of Bayliss Boatworks shops. Serv-
ant leadership describes John’s 17 years in
boatbuilding. He puts his employees and cus-
tomers first and is always willing to go the
extra mile to help others. Humility, honesty, in-
tegrity, work ethic and love for his family,
friends and co-workers are reflected in every
aspect of his life. He has a deep, lifelong pas-
sion for sportfishing and boatbuilding and con-
tinues to build upon this legacy every day.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
recognizing the accomplishments of John
Bayliss as he and Bayliss Boatworks celebrate
17 years in operation. May God bless John

HONORING KIRSTJEN NIELSEN
AND HER SERVICE TO OUR
COUNTRY
HON. RICHARD HUDSON
OF NORTH CAROLINA

Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Secretary Kirstjen
Nielsen and her years of service to our
country as Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security.
It is no secret that we are in un-
charted territory when it comes to our
security, both at home and abroad.
Whether in the realm of cybersecurity,
border security, or counterterrorism,
Secretary Nielsen has been integral in
protecting the lives of hundreds of mil-
lions of Americans. And while the cri-
sis at our Southern border and ter-
rorist threats grab the headlines, I
would also like to thank Secretary
Nielsen just as much for her leadership
in responding to hurricanes that have
devastated the Carolinas the past few
years.
Secretary Nielsen has shown pro-
found leadership and unwavering dedi-
cation as the Secretary of Homeland
Security. Our country is facing a hu-
manitarian and security crisis at our
Southern border Secretary Nielsen has
been dogged in taking on the Herculean
task of addressing these unprecedented
challenges. Yet, she has always con-
ducted her duties with professionalism
and poise. Secretary Nielsen’s deter-
mination to act in the country’s best
interest will be extremely tough to re-
place.
In her early career, Secretary Nielsen
served as Special Assistant to the
President as Senior Director for Pre-
vention, Preparedness and Response
under President George W. Bush. After
serving in the private sector as the
founder and president of Sunesis Con-
sulting LLC, she answered the call to
serve again and became Chief of Staff
to the then-Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, General John Kelly and then
White House Deputy Chief of Staff.
While our nation has demanded so
much of her, Secretary Nielsen has
risen to the occasion each and every
time.
Madam Speaker, please join me in
thanking Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen
for her incredible dedication and serv-
ice to our country upon her departure
as Secretary of Homeland Security.
RECOGNIZING DR. TANIA ISRAEL
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Dr. Tania Israel for her Congres-
sional Women of the Year Award and for all
the incredible work she does to improve the
quality of life on the Central Coast.
Dr. Tania Israel is a Professor of Counseling
Psychology at UCSB who has provided lead-
ership in the Santa Barbara community and
beyond for decades. In 2010, Dr. Israel col-
laborated with several Santa Barbara non-
profits to lead a community-based participatory
research project which surveyed the LGBTQ
community about their perceptions and con-
cerns, which led to a mandatory 5-hour work-
shop on LGBTQ issues for all sworn police of-
ficers in the City of Santa Barbara. The work-
shop almost immediately proved to signifi-
cantly improve relations between police and
the LGBTQ community.
Most recently, Dr. Israel has designed and
presented a two-hour interactive workshop, ti-
tled Beyond the Bubble, to help participants
engage in productive dialogues across political
lines by building their skills in active listening,
managing emotions, and perspective taking.
Hundreds of people in Santa Barbara County
have taken advantage of Beyond the Bubble
in workshops delivered to the Santa Maria-
Lompoc NAACP, the Santa Barbara Progres-
sive Coalition, Congregation B’nai B’rith, and a
League of Women Voters community forum,
among others. Dr. Israel has not charged any
of these organizations or their participants for
her time and expertise, instead describing the
workshop as her offering to our community.

SAMUEL TRUJILLO
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Samuel Tru-
jillo for receiving the Adams County Mayors
and Commissioners Youth Award.
The Youth Award focuses on teenagers who
have overcome personal adversity and cre-
ated positive changes in their lives and their
community. The program provides businesses,
the community and civic leaders an oppor-
tunity to support young people in their commu-
nities and recognize their accomplishments.
Samuel is the perfect recipient for this award
because despite adversities and challenges,
he has become an inspiration and role model
for his peers.
The dedication and leadership demonstrated
by Samuel is exemplary of the type of
achievement that can be attained with hard
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of
their education and develop a work ethic
which will guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Samuel Trujillo for this well-deserved recogni-
tion. I have no doubt he will exhibit the same
dedication and character in all of his future ac-
complishments.
HONORING THE GAY AND LESBIAN
ACTIVISTS ALLIANCE OF WASH-
INGTON, DC
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I have the
honor of representing the oldest continuously
functioning Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Transgender and Questioning (LGBTQ) orga-
nization in the United States. Today, I rise to
ask the House of Representatives to join me
in recognizing the 48th anniversary of the Gay
and Lesbian Activists Alliance of Washington,
D.C. (GLAA).
GLAA is Washington’s premier LGBTQ or-
ganization. Washingtonians know that GLAA
champions the District of Columbia’s full and
equal rights. It calls for stronger enforcement
of D.C.’s comprehensive landmark Human
Rights Act of 1977. GLAA helped form and
marshall the grassroots coalition of D.C. resi-
dents and elected officials that resulted in the
enactment of the District of Columbia Reli-
gious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality
Amendment Act. D.C. recognized same-sex
marriages five years before the Supreme
Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.
GLAA advocates on behalf of LGBTQ youth
and seniors. It demands the right of equal
treatment for transgender individuals by the
police and access to culturally competent
healthcare. GLAA educates local officeholders
and office seekers on LGBTQ issues. It also
nurtures and builds coalitions with other con-
stituencies to advance LGBTQ causes and to
defend the District’s autonomy.
At its 48th anniversary reception on April 18,
2019, GLAA will recognize the 2019 Distin-
guished Service Awards recipients:
Center Global, a program of the D.C. Center
for the LGBT Community. Matt Corso and Eric
Scharf co-founded Center Global in 2012.
Under their guidance, Center Global supported
nearly 300 asylum-seekers through this na-
tion’s immigration processes. The asylees
come from nations on the African continent,
Eastern Europe, Russia, the former Soviet
bloc, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.
Center Global follows a unique model. It
provides access to healthcare, legal assist-
ance, financial support, and most importantly,
a safe LGBTQ peer community that is often
unattainable in D.C.-area diasporas. Its pro-
gram includes case-management services;
monthly support dinner and volunteers meet-
ings; community and Capitol Hill education
and outreach initiatives; partnerships with the
Human Rights Campaign and D.C.-area social
support and asylum organizations; and the an-
nual May fundraising reception. Center Global
is a volunteer-staffed program, led by its exec-
utive committee (Tom Sommers, Chair, and
Eric Scharf, Vice Chair) under the D.C. Cen-
ter’s administrative umbrella.
Compassion & Choices led the lobbying for
the D.C. Death with Dignity Act of 2016, which
became law in 2017. Compassion & Choices
envisions a society that affirms life and ac-
cepts the inevitability of death, embraces ex-
panded options for compassionate dying and
empowers people to choose end-of-life care
that reflects their values, priorities and beliefs.
It is a nationwide organization that works to
ensure that healthcare providers honor and

Compassion & Choices works in communities,
state legislatures, Congress, courts and med-
ical settings to educate the public about the
importance of documenting end-of-life values
and priorities and about the full range of avail-
able end-of-life care. It empowers individuals
with options, information and advice for guid-
ing their care and engaging with providers.
Compassion & Choices advocates for ex-
panded choices, secure and ready access to
them and improved medical practice that puts
patients first and values quality of life in treat-
ment plans for terminal illness, and it defends
existing end-of-life options from efforts to re-
strict access.

TRIBUTE TO JOY COLLINS–BRODT-
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
WOMAN OF THE YEAR
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference
in my Congressional District. I would like to
recognize a remarkable woman, Joy Collins-
Brodt of Burbank, California.
Ms. Collins-Brodt, along with her eight sib-
lings were born and raised in Pomona, Cali-
fornia. Joy’s mother, a native Floridian, and fa-
ther, a Nigerian immigrant, taught their chil-
dren to treat all people with dignity and re-
spect. Living into the life lessons her parents
taught her, Joy traveled to countries including
Mexico and Bolivia to volunteer at local or-
phanages.
Upon graduating from high school, Joy at-
tended Azua Pacific University and received
her Bachelor of Arts Degree in Broadcast
Journalism and Documentary Film with a
minor in Communication Studies. She was the
first of her siblings to attend and graduate
from a university. After her college graduation,
Ms. Collins-Brodt moved to Burbank to begin
her career in television production and enter-
tainment.
Joy worked on a variety of television shows
including ‘‘24’’ at NBC Universal and Fox Tele-
vision. Outside of her work in television, Joy
and a team of active women launched Darling
Magazine, a women’s lifestyle magazine that
featured body-positive photographs of women
that were never photo-edited or altered. Dur-
ing this time in her professional career, she
learned about human-trafficking issues and
began volunteering for the International Jus-
tice Mission (IJM), the largest global anti-traf-
ficking organization. Her passion to combat
global human-trafficking grew and in 2015 she
left her career in television to accept the Chief
Operations Officer position at Treasures Min-
istries, an organization that serves as an out-
reach and support network for women who are
victims of sex-trafficking and in the adult enter-
tainment industry.
Ms. Collins-Brodt continues her volunteer
work for the International Justice Mission now
as the Advocacy Coordinator of Southern Cali-
fornia. Joy has lobbied in Washington, D.C. for
anti-trafficking legislation such as the Child
Protection Compact Act, which helped create
a trafficking task force in the Philippines that
saves children from trafficking. She hopes that
others use their voice and engage with policy
leaders about legislation and to see the end of
human-trafficking.
Today, Joy lives in Burbank with her hus-
band, Josh and they both enjoy long drives
along the Pacific Coast.
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Joy Collins-
Brodt.

REINTRODUCTION OF RESOLUTION
SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND
IDEALS OF JUBILEE DAY
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce a resolution supporting the
goals and ideals of Jubilee Day, which is cele-
brated on October 6th of every year by the
Fisk University community.
Just after the end of the Civil War, the Fisk
School was founded in Nashville, Tennessee
as an educational institute that would be open
to all, regardless of race or age. However, just
five years after its founding, the school faced
dire economic struggles.
In an effort to save the University from clos-
ing, a group of students formed a choral
group, the Fisk Jubilee Singers, with the goal
of raising money to fund the institution. They
took all of the funds in the university’s treasury
for travel expenses, hoping that the enormous
risk would pay off.
Despite a few initial struggles, the Jubilee
Singers eventually came to tour throughout
the United States and Europe and raised
enough funds to not only preserve the Univer-
sity, but also to pay for the construction of Ju-
bilee Hall, the first permanent structure built
for the education of African American students
in the South.
The singers performed for such notable fig-
ures as William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phil-
lips, Ulysses S. Grant, William Gladstone,
Mark Twain, Johann Strauss, and Queen Vic-
toria. Through their music they introduced the
world to the spirituals of enslaved Africans as
a musical genre.
Since its founding in 1866, Fisk University
has educated countless intellectuals, artists,
and civic leaders, and has played a pivotal
role in the advancement of education for Afri-
can American students. None of its accom-
plishments would have been possible without
the talents and sacrifices of that first group of
nine students.
Madam Speaker, as a proud alumnus of
Fisk University, I urge my colleagues to honor
the hard work, perseverance, and accomplish-
ments of the original Jubilee Singers by co-
sponsoring this resolution, and I urge its im-
mediate consideration.

and working two years on immigration cases
in New York City, Anahi Mendoza realized that
the city she grew up in, Santa Maria, is largely

many of these people are immigrants in risk of
been deported and been separated from their
families. Starting with her passion for civil
rights and immigration law coupled with the
help of generous donors, Anahi founded the
Santa Barbara County immigrant Legal De-
fense Center. The center has been helping
many immigrant families in our local commu-
nity. Anahi has been conducting Know Your
Rights presentations in Santa Barbara County
so that immigrants are informed of their rights
should they encounter Immigration and Cus-
toms Enforcement (ICE). She has worked ex-
tensively to create community clinics to screen
individuals for immigration relief, assess their
criminal record, and determine whether they
have a final order of deportation. Anahi works

IN MEMORIAM OF THE

OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to the
life and legacy of Charles Ronald Rose, Sr.
Mr. Rose served the Dallas community for
an extraordinary 39 years, holding many dif-
ferent roles along the way. He served as a
Trustee on the Wilmer Hutchins Independent
School Board, as the Dallas County Justice of
Peace for Precinct 8, Place 1, and held mem-
berships in numerous local, state and national
organizations. As Justice of Peace, Mr. Rose
was well-respected amongst his colleagues for
his fairness on the bench.
Mr. Rose collected multiple accolades rec-
ognizing his service to the community, includ-
ing the 2013 Legislative Black Caucus Texan
of the Year, the Alpha Sigma Lambda Chapter
Trailblazer Award, and the 2018 Jubilee Pro-
ductions Award of Service. However, it was
not the awards that he worked for; rather, Mr.
Rose found satisfaction in positive, tangible
change in his community.
Mr. Rose was preceded in death by his par-
ents, Homer Rose, Sr. and Dorothy Evelyn
Hollingsworth Rose; two children, Ronnie and
Nikki; five brothers, Homer, Jr., Horace,
Roger, Odell and Fred; and one sister, Marie
Conner. His memory is survived by his wife,
Gazelle; three daughters, Texas State Rep-
resentative Toni Rose, Lachon Jacobs (née
Jeffrey), and Nina Hawkins (née Everett); and
many wonderful grandchildren, great-grand-
children, nieces and nephews, and friends.
Madam Speaker, I would like to extend my
condolences to Charles Rose’s family, friends
and loved ones. The Dallas community will
miss him dearly.

HONORING CLYDE KENNETH
‘‘WINDY’’ ENGLAND
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer
these remarks in honor of Clyde Kenneth
‘‘Windy’’ England, Martinsville, Virginia’s last
hero of D-Day. Mr. England died on February
28 at the age of 103.
He was born in Brevard, North Carolina, on
May 4, 1915. After moving with his family to
Martinsville in 1933, he worked at the
Martinsville Cotton Mill and the Martinsville
Novelty Company. In Virginia, he met Mildred
Draper, whom he married on December 30,
1939 in the parlor of the old First Baptist
Church.
Amid the gathering storm that would be-
come World War II, he joined the Virginia Na-
tional Guard in 1936. His unit was activated in
1941 and later sent to Britain. On the morning
of June 6, 1944, he stormed Omaha Beach in
Normandy as a technical sergeant leading
Company H of the 116th Infantry Regiment,
29th Infantry Division.
Bad weather had delayed the invasion by a
day, and the time spent on the English Chan-
nel had made many of the men seasick. As
the landing craft carrying the soldiers ap-
proached the beach, Mr. England remembered
that the men stayed composed as they came
under German fire without panic. They had a
job to do.
When they landed on the beach, Mr. Eng-
land’s unit was several hundred yards away
from where it was supposed to be, and it be-
came mixed up with several other units. He
had to move his men across the beach while
under fire to a sea wall. With smoke providing
cover, the men moved up to the wall and were
able to breach the barbed wire. Continuing to
press onward, they arrived at their objective of
Les Moulin the next morning, having estab-
lished a beachhead. It came at a steep price
to his unit: ten of forty men were killed and
seventeen wounded, including Mr. England.
He fought across France as the Allies ad-
vanced, and a wound received by a sniper put
him in the hospital for six months. He returned
to Martinsville after the war and continued
serving in the Virginia National Guard until
1973. Retired Army Lieutenant Colonel W.C.
Fowlkes remembered him as ‘‘a soldier’s sol-
dier; everything he did was for the betterment
of his soldiers.’’
Among his many decorations, Mr. England
earned a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart with
Cluster, an American Defense Medal, the Eu-
ropean Theater of Operations Medal, a WWII
Victory Medal, an Army Reserve Medal with
two clusters, and a Virginia Service Medal with
5 clusters, as well as a Presidential Unit Cita-
tion Medal for his unit’s role in D-Day. On the
15th anniversary of D-Day, Mr. England was
one of four people representing Virginia at the
dedication of a memorial at Omaha Beach.
Mr. England enjoyed hunting, fishing, and
traveling in his retirement, and worshipped at
the First Baptist Church of Martinsville. He and
his wife Mildred remained happily married for
79 years before her death on November 12,
2018. Mr. England is survived by his daughter
Deborah Slaydon and his grandsons Matthew
and Jared Slaydon.
In his Order of the Day for June 6, 1944,
General Dwight D. Eisenhower told the men of
the Allied Expeditionary Force, ‘‘The eyes of
the world are upon you. The hopes and pray-
ers of liberty-loving people everywhere march
with you.’’ This heavy burden fell upon men
such as Clyde ‘‘Windy’’ England. All of us who
live in freedom today can be grateful that he
and his fellow heroes of D-Day bore it with
courage and honor until they achieved victory.

TRIBUTE TO JOELLE DOBROW—
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
WOMAN OF THE YEAR
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference
in my Congressional District. I would like to
recognize a remarkable woman, Joelle
Dobrow of the Echo Park neighborhood of Los
Angeles, California.
After graduating from the University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles in 1970 with a bachelor’s
degree in film and television, Ms. Dobrow be-
came a pioneering activist in Hollywood. At a
time when women simply didn’t have opportu-
nities to produce and direct films, Joelle and
five other female directors set out to make a
change. The ‘‘Original Six,’’ as they’ve come
to be known, decided to get organized in the
fight against sexism and together, they formed
the first Women’s Steering Committee of the
Directors Guild of America. Decades before
the Me Too movement forced a Hollywood
reckoning, Dobrow and the Original Six spear-
headed the first entertainment industry law-
suits against feature films studios for discrimi-
nation against women and ethnic minorities.
Ms. Dobrow and the Original Six received
the recognition for their important activism ef-
forts with the recent book Liberating Holly-
wood and upcoming documentary This
Changes Everything, which features Joelle
along with Meryl Streep and Geena Davis as
feminist crusaders in Hollywood.
Joelle’s groundbreaking leadership is appar-
ent in her television career as the first woman
Producer/Director for the bay area television
station KTEH, and later, the first woman Asso-
ciate Director/Stage Manager at KABC–TV in
Los Angeles. She continued to have an ac-
complished career as a television producer
and director, including working for Noticiero
Estudiantil—for which she won an Emmy—
and Good Morning America among many oth-
ers. She also helped produce live events such
as TV Goes to the Hollywood Bowl and Holly-
wood Remembers the Blacklist.
Fifteen years ago, Ms. Dobrow founded the
Edendale Library Friends Society (ELFS) in
her neighborhood of Echo Park and has since
led the organization as President. Joelle and
the ELFS serve as a vital bridge between the
Los Angeles Public Library, elected officials,
Echo Park Neighborhood Council, other near-
by non-profit organizations, and the local com-
munity. In addition to her volunteer service
with ELFS, Joelle also served on the success-
ful Yes on Measure L campaign, a measure
which permanently increased library funding
for the City of Los Angeles.
In 2013, Ms. Dobrow received an Executive
Master of Arts in Arts Management from
Claremont Graduate University. She was re-
cently the recipient of the Drucker Women in
Leadership Fellowship, the Ahmanson Fellow-
ship, and an Altrusa Richardson grant.
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Joelle
Dobrow.

Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to

These individuals prevailed over a number of

honors in the Massachusetts ‘We The People’
academic contest for the second year in a
row. They have accordingly earned the distinc-
tion of representing the Commonwealth in the
32nd ‘We The People’ national finals this
month in Washington, D.C.
The annual ‘We The People’ tournament is
a wonderful opportunity that brings bright
young people together to learn about and de-
bate issues of great importance in today’s
world. The students of Easthampton High
School’s team not only displayed exceptional
commitment, ability, and character in pre-
paring for and winning the statewide competi-
tion this winter, but they have also worked
even harder this spring as they have looked
forward to competing in the national competi-
tion. They have been preparing to testify at
mock congressional hearings, demonstrate
their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, issue
statements on a variety of topics related to our
country’s political and historical heritage, and
field complex questions from a panel of expert
judges. There is no doubt in my mind that they
will find this whole experience uniquely valu-
able for years to come.
This year’s Easthampton High School ‘We
The People’ team have been led by their
teachers Kelley Brown and Taylor Dadmun
who have provided crucial guidance and in-
strumental mentorship. The outstanding work
performed by this group is a testament to the
value of quality teachers in the Massachusetts
public school system. The victorious students
are Kerissa Bilski, Joseph Brough, Kunden
Chumego, Samuel Colenback, Benjamin
Dameworth, Sophia Fiordalice, Corinne
Gawle, Joseph Hwang, Madeline Kleeberg,
Kassidy Marowitz, Abigail McMahon,
Jaquelline Perez, Madison Rinker, Madison
Rodriguez, Trevor Waldron, Hanna
Wauczinski, Christopher Williams, and
Mohamed Zabir. The team’s student coaches
include Lucas Patton, Vinnie Catalano, and
Fernando Tenesaca.
Madam Speaker, I would like to once again
acknowledge Easthampton High School’s ‘We
The People’ academic team for their superb
achievements. Strong civic education is the
foundation of our democracy and these inspir-
ing students have exemplified the finest quali-
ties of informed citizenship. I am proud of this
group, and I wish them all the best in their up-
coming national competition as well as all their
other future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL FED-
ERATION OF PUBLIC AND PRI-
VATE EMPLOYEES AND ITS 25TH
ANNIVERSARY
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the National Federation of Public
and Private Employees (FOPE) as it cele-
brates 25 years of fighting for American work-
ers.
The National Federation of Public and Pri-
vate Employees represents over 15,000 public
sector employees in Florida who work for our
colleges and universities, our counties and
municipalities, and our school board and law
enforcement agencies. Additionally, FOPE
represents numerous private sector employ-
ees across the United States in the fields of
aerospace, automotive, forestry, and parking
and transportation.
The right to collective bargaining is vital for
strong labor and safety standards. Since pas-
sage of the National Labor Relations Act in
1935, employees have had the right to orga-
nize and determine whether they wish to have
unions to represent them. As a result of this
organizing, union members earn 28% more in
yearly wages, are more likely to have em-
ployer provided health insurance, and enjoy
more secure pension benefits than their coun-
terparts.
Madam Speaker, the benefits of FOPE’ s ef-
forts reach far beyond its membership, improv-
ing the working conditions and compensation
of workers across the board. For this, I ask my
colleagues to join me in congratulating and
thanking FOPE and its current President, Dan
Reynolds, on their 25 years of service to work-
ers in my district and across the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E436 April 9, 2019
Wanchese, North Carolina, a team who every
day applies their experience and unique
craftsmen touch in creating the perfect vessels
for their clientele. They are world renowned for
exceptional attention to detail and building
boats the right way. Team Bayliss Boatworks
is over 100 strong and are all experts in their
trades. Every step of designing and building
boats is done in house with total attention to
honoring their customers. They build the most
effective, efficient, and well-built sportfishing
boat in existence.
Bayliss Boatworks was established in 2002.
The team was able to immediately draw up a
number of contracts to begin their brand-new
shop to create their exquisite boats used for
fishing, travel and entertainment. Each boat is
custom made to fit the needs and preferences
of each client. These boats begin as a jig until
it surpasses benchmarks like the ‘‘Whiskey
Plank,’’ hull rollover, and engine install. From
there, the boats will have their cabins in-
stalled, flybridge and mezzanine build-out, in-
terior cabinetry construction, paint, sea trial,
and lastly, delivery to the client. The hard work
of the employees can be seen on the water
around the world. Since its establishment in
2002, Bayliss Boatworks have received men-
tions in magazines such as Marlin, being clas-
sified among the top builders in the world. It
is a prestigious honor to be considered among
the world’s best boat craftsmen. The Team at
Bayliss Boatworks is a family with each mem-
ber respecting and valuing their colleagues
that are always striving to be better and set
the standard for the boat building industry.
They are focused on building the best
sportfishing boats in the world and with assur-
ing that all of the needs of their customers are
met.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
recognizing the accomplishments of Bayliss
Boatworks as they celebrate 17 years in oper-
ation. May God bless the hardworking employ-
ees of Bayliss Boatworks, and I look forward
to seeing their excellence for many years into

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Orianna
Langill for receiving the Adams County Mayors
and Commissioners Youth Award.
The Youth Award focuses on teenagers who
have overcome personal adversity and cre-
ated positive changes in their lives and their

achievement that can be attained with hard
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of
their education and develop a work ethic
which will guide them for the rest of their lives.

RECOGNIZING BILL MCGAHAN,
FOUNDER OF GEORGIA WORKS!
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to pay tribute to Bill McGahan,
founder of Georgia Works!, for the life chang-
ing impact he has made on countless men in
the greater Atlanta area.
Bill McGahan founded Georgia Works! in
2013 based off his fundamental belief that
every life has value, and virtually every person
can be given the tools and habits to make
their lives better. With the ultimate goal of
achieving self-sufficiency, Georgia Works!
strives to end homelessness, criminal recidi-
vism and dependency among chronically
homeless men in Atlanta through programs
that ensure personal development in good
habits, work ethic and character.
By helping participants gain stable employ-
ment and housing, Georgia Works! offers
homeless men a second chance at life.
Through personal support, case management,
and workforce training, as well as AA/NA
classes, GED classes, support in obtaining a
driver’s license, help setting up a bank ac-
count, and life skill preparation courses, the
program works to set them up for long term
success.
Thanks to Bill McGahan’s leadership, Geor-
gia Works! has graduated more than 600 men.
Even more impressive is the fact that the pro-
gram has accomplished this major milestone
without accepting a single dime of government
funding.
While Georgia Works! is among his most
prominent accomplishments, Bill McGahan’s
love for and dedication to his community
stretches far and wide. Bill has been involved
in many organizations and non-profit boards
including: The State of Georgia Housing Trust
Fund for the Homeless Commission; Atlanta
Area Co-Chair of the Steering Committee for
the Governor’s Office of Transition, Support
and Reentry; From Houses to Homes; Atlanta
Academy; The Howard School, The Paces
Civic Association; and The National Founda-
tion for Facial Reconstruction.
As we celebrate Second Chance Month, I’m
incredibly proud to recognize Bill McGahan for
his dedication to providing men with an oppor-
tunity for a second chance. On behalf of the
people of Georgia, I commend him for his
service and I thank him for his steadfast com-
mitment to bettering our communities.

TRIBUTE TO SOFIYA FIKHMAN—
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
WOMAN OF THE YEAR
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference
in my Congressional District. I would like to
recognize a remarkable woman, Sofiya
Fikhman of West Hollywood, California.
Born in the Ukraine in 1939, Sofiya was two
years old when the war between the Soviet
Union and Germany began. During World War
II, she and her family, along with thirteen
strangers, lived in the Bershad ghetto in a
one-room tenement. After the Soviet army
freed the ghetto in 1944, Sofiya and her family
returned to Savran in 1945, where they lived
until 1952, thereafter moving to Moldova to
join her father’s family, where she pursued her
education at a medical college to become a
nurse.
Sofiya married her husband, Shmil, in 1958,
and they had two children. Upon completing
her degree that same year, she began work in
a children’s hospital as a supervisor until
1967; then worked in early childhood edu-
cation, retiring in 1988 to help raise her grand-
children. Ms. Fikhman was over fifty years old
when she and her family moved to the United
States in 1991, with the dream of creating a
new life in a new country. She worked as a
caregiver for the elderly, babysitter, and volun-
teered in her free time.
A tireless and dedicated volunteer, Ms.
Fikhman has always enjoyed being of service
to people in the community. She joined the
Association of Holocaust Survivors from the
Former Soviet Union in 1996, and two years
later, started volunteering for the organization
and undertook various tasks including answer-
ing telephone calls, curating events, assisting
new immigrants, and visiting survivors in care
facilities and hospitals. She expanded her vol-
unteer work by visiting several Jewish day
schools, where she educated young people
about her experience during the Holocaust.
Ms. Fikhman became a member of the City of
West Hollywood Russian Advisory Board in
2006, where she continued to plan cultural
events and assist immigrant families. Pres-
ently, Sofiya is a staunch volunteer at the City
of West Hollywood’s Russian Language Public
Library.
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Sofiya
Fikhman.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E437
April 9, 2019
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA FLOOD PREVEN-
TION ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the District of Columbia Flood Preven-
tion Act of 2019. The bill would amend the
Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972
(CZMA) to include the nation’s capital in the
definition of ‘‘coastal state.’’ Our bill would cor-
rect an apparent oversight in the omission of
the District of Columbia and would make the
District eligible to receive federal funding and
provide oversight for federally issued permits,
facilities and actions that affect the coastal
waters of the District. The District urgently
needs the protection of the CZMA because of
serious flood risks that currently affect federal
assets, residents and businesses, including
the National Mall and the cluster of downtown
federal agencies.
In an effort to reduce coastal flood risk,
Congress has authorized a number of pro-
grams to help states and territories respond to
floods and mitigate risk through resiliency
projects. Among these programs, the CZMA
provides planning and technical services to
assist states in protecting, restoring and devel-
oping coastal communities and resources.
Once the federal government approves a
state’s coastal management plan, the state
becomes eligible for grants. Federal actions
must be consistent with the state plans and
vice versa.
Even though the District is located on two
rivers and has suffered substantial coastal
floods in the past, D.C. was omitted from the
list of eligible states and territories in the
CZMA. This oversight probably occurred be-
cause the CZMA was passed in 1972—before
the District achieved home rule. Of note,
under Section 304 of the CZMA, ‘‘coastal
state[s]’’ include the states and U.S. territories
(Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, the Trust Territories of the Pacific Is-
lands and American Samoa). Absent from this
definition is the District, even though the Dis-
trict, including the federal complex, is under a
serious threat from rising sea levels. Because
territories are included in the definition of
‘‘coastal states,’’ it appears that D.C.’s omis-
sion is a mistake, which only Congress can
correct.
Scientists have predicted that the tides on
the Atlantic Coast could rise two to four feet
by the year 2100, causing property worth as
much as $7 billion in the District to be rou-
tinely under threat by floodwaters. This dam-
age not only includes private homes and busi-
nesses, but the National Mall, federal buildings
and three military bases located in the District.
The Anacostia and Potomac Rivers are both
tidally influenced, showing tangible salt water
effects (and fish), and are part of an
‘‘intertidal-zone’’ existing between high and
low maritime tides. In addition, the Maryland
and Virginia coastal zones each include the
tidal Potomac River, with Maryland’s zone
ending at the District line. Because of these
factors, the District should be eligible under
the CZMA just like the states and territories al-
ready listed in the CZMA.
I urge support for this bill.

RECOGNIZING YESSENIA
MARROQUIN
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Yessenia Marroquin for her Con-
gressional Women of the Year Award and for
all the incredible work she does to improve the
quality of life on the Central Coast.
Yessenia has been serving our community
for over 20 years through her work at Santa
Barbara Neighborhood Clinics—and she is not
even 40 years old! She came to this country
from El Salvador as a child and has excelled
ever since due to her intelligence, persever-
ance and good nature. She began at SBNC in
college as a volunteer. Over the years, she
has worked as a medical assistant, clinic man-
ager and now serves as the Director of Oper-
ations. She is an unsung hero of SBNC ac-
cording to her colleagues. She has remained
dedicated and calm through multiple chal-
lenges and the clinic almost shutting its doors.
Through it all, Yessenia and her warm smile
were a beacon for its employees and patients.
She has led numerous initiatives at SBNC that
have resulted in better patient care, coordina-
tion with other community partners and ensur-
ing SBNC is meeting the needs of the His-
panic Community. I am glad to recognize her
work to make Santa Barbara healthier, espe-
cially for the most vulnerable.

HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor a remarkable constituent of mine
named Pat Farrell. Pat enlisted in the Navy in
1968, serving as Aviation Electronics Techni-
cian until 1971. Following the Navy, Pat
worked for the U.S. Postal Service and as a
Corrections Job Coordinator. Pat has dedi-
cated a large portion of his life to working with
homeless veterans. In 2013, 2014, and 2015
Pat took the lead overseeing the Tri-State
Homeless Veterans StandDown in Bullhead
City, Arizona where he assisted 750 homeless
and at-risk veterans.
Pat has been essential to the Homeless
Veterans StandDown year after year. After a
successful 2013 StandDown, he secured
$10,300 in funding to organize the following
year’s event. Pat continues to give back to the
veteran community by volunteering with the
HUD & VA Supportive Veterans Housing
Project and numerous other programs aimed
at eradicating veteran’s homelessness. Due to
Pat’s efforts, the VA Community Outpatient
Clinic in Kingman, Arizona was also able to be
built.
Pat truly represents what it means to be
selfless. The veterans of Mohave County and
the state of Arizona are forever grateful for
Pat’s hard work. I commend him for his dedi-
cation to those who have served this country.

transit center for the Southwestern United
States. Just as the Dallas Union Station has
significantly enhanced the quality of life for the
Dallas area, so has Congresswoman EDDIE
BERNICE JOHNSON, and I cannot think of a
more deserving person to receive this monu-
mental tribute.
Congresswoman EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON is
serving her 14th term representing the 30th
Congressional District of Texas. She is the
first African-American and woman to chair the
House Committee on Science, Space, and
Technology (where she served as Ranking
Member from 2011 to 2018) and is the Dean
of the Texas Congressional delegation in addi-
tion to serving as Dean of the Texas, New
Mexico, and Arizona Democratic Congres-
sional Delegations. Congresswoman JOHNSON
is also the highest-ranking Texan on the
House Transportation and Infrastructure Com-
mittee, the first nurse to be elected to the U.S.
Congress, and a member of the Sub-
committee on Aviation and the Subcommittee
on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Mate-
rials.
Congresswoman JOHNSON was born on De-
cember 3, 1935, to the union of the late Lee
Edward Johnson and Lillie Mae White John-
son in Waco, Texas. A true intellectual, she
graduated from A.J. Moore High School at the
age of sixteen. Soon after graduating, she
began her studies in Nursing at Saint Mary’s
College of Notre Dame, where she excelled
and became a registered nurse after passing
the National Board Examination in 1955. She
continued to advance her education by earn-
ing her Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing
from Texas Christian University in 1967 and
her Master of Public Administration degree
from Southern Methodist University in 1976.
Congresswoman JOHNSON began her career
as the first female African-American Chief
Psychiatric Nurse at the V.A. Hospital in Dal-
las. In 1972, she became the first nurse ever
elected to the Texas State House and
achieved that same distinction upon her elec-
tion to the Texas Senate in 1986.
Congresswoman JOHNSON is more than a
legislator. She is a servant to all humankind.
In addition to her civic duties, she continues to
give of herself to countless causes and organi-
zations, such as her acclaimed initiative, A
World of Women for World Peace, which has
garnered national and international recogni-
tion. Dr. Maya Angelou once said that ‘‘I’ve
learned that you shouldn’t go through life with
a catcher’s mitt on both hands; you need to be
able to throw something back.’’ During the
more than 40 years that she has served as a
public servant, Congresswoman JOHNSON has
thrown a prodigious amount of love and serv-
ice back to the state and nation she loves so
dearly.
Congresswoman JOHNSON has achieved so
much in her life, but none of it would have
been possible without the love and support of
her loving son, Kirk; and her grandsons, Kirk
Jr., David, and James.
On a personal note, Congresswoman JOHN-
SON is my classmate, both of us having been
elected in 1992. Immediately upon meeting
her I was awed by her grace, dignity, class,
elegance, and eloquence. Her manner of quiet
persuasion and passion have propelled her to
numerous leadership positions, including her
election as Chair of the Congressional Black
Caucus. She is a friend of longstanding and
her deep humility and compassion reflect the
timbre of her character.
Congresswoman JOHNSON is truly a stellar
example of servant leadership. I am proud to
have served alongside her in Congress where
her friendship, leadership, and counsel are
held in high regard by many.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
my wife, Vivian; and me, along with the people
of the 30th Congressional District of Texas
and countless others all across America, in
extending our sincerest congratulations to
Congresswoman EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON on
this tremendous honor and lasting memorial to
her legacy of service to her community, state,
nation, and humankind.

Waterman, Claude L. Winfield and the Com-
mittee’s Chairperson, Michelle Winfield. Their
goal has been to gain recognition of the site
where America’s first juvenile court operated
for more than six decades.
Before the early 1900s, children under the
age of 16 who were accused of crimes were
tried and sentenced as adults. Progressive re-
formers believed young people awaiting trial in
the same jails as adult criminal suspects were
more likely to become repeat offenders than to
be rehabilitated. In 1902, an act of the New
York State legislature established the Chil-
dren’s Part within the NY Court of Special
Sessions, making New York County the first in
the United States to have a juvenile court
housed in its own building. The court, initially
located at 66 Third Avenue, near East 11th
Street, opened that summer.
The reform law also reclassified all crimes
committed by minors under the age of 16,
other than capital offenses, as misdemeanors
so as to shield children from harsh sentencing
laws. Emphasizing reform instead of detention
helped countless children avoid being labeled
as criminals. The guiding principle was, as a
1902 NY Times article put it, ‘‘to guard chil-
dren against the exposure and environment of
crime.’’
By 1912, the original building was viewed as
unsanitary, and noise from the nearby ele-
vated train line made it hard to carry out court,
proceedings. The decision was made to invest
$250,000 in a new Children’s Court building.
On July 1, 1915, the Children’s Court was offi-
cially established as a separate entity from the
Court of Special Sessions and relocated to
137 East 22nd Street, near Third Avenue. The
new site was chosen due to its proximity to
other social welfare institutions, including the
YMCA, United Charities, the Catholic Mission

House, the Manhattan Trade School for Girls,
and the Free Academy—a predecessor of City
College and the current site of Baruch Col-
lege. A testament to New York’s commitment
to reforming young people’s relationship with
the justice system, the building housed a large
main courtroom, physical and mental health
services, and its own probation department.
The Children’s Court occupied this space until
1981, at which point the Family Court, as it is
now called, relocated to 60 Lafayette Street.
Today, the Children’s Court building is home
to Baruch College’s Steven L. Newman Real
Estate Institute. More than a century later,
though, the original inscription on the build-
ing’s cornerstone still reads: ‘‘For every child
let truth spring from earth and justice and
mercy look down from heaven.’’ Like the in-
scription, the designation of this corner as
Children’s Court Way will serve as a reminder
of the advances we have made in child wel-
fare and the far-sighted reformers who dedi-
cated their lives to the protection and ad-
vancement of America’s children.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing the dedication of the 100
Committee to Commemorate the Children’s
Court and celebrating the designation of Chil-
dren’s Court Way.

RECOGNIZING DR. LEOLA DUBLIN
MACMILLAN
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Dr. Leola Dublin Macmillan for her
Congressional Women of the Year Award and
for all the incredible work she does to improve
the quality of life on the Central Coast.
Dr. Leola Dublin Macmillan serves on the
board of Just Communities Central Coast, is
on the steering committee of RACE Matters
SLO County, and is a member of the SLO Po-
lice Department’s Police And Community To-
gether (PACT) community group. She has
taught as a Lecturer at Cal Poly for the Ethnic
Studies and Women’s and Gender Studies de-
partments. Leola is deeply invested in making
our community a more just and equitable
place. She has organized and led many work-
shops on the Central Coast, sharing her ex-
tensive knowledge about how difference (in
race/class/gender/sexual orientation/
(dis)ability) is understood within U.S. contexts.
Above all, she is a passionate advocate for
her students. She has been supporting and
guiding students in pursuing their own advo-
cacy projects, including helping with orga-
nizing the UnstoPPable Conference at Cal
Poly and bringing to the attention of SLO City
Council the need for improved lighting in
neighborhoods surrounding Cal Poly campus.
She selflessly and patiently educates our com-
munities on difficult to discuss topics such as
structural racism.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Noah Falance
Martinez for receiving the Adams County May-
ors and Commissioners Youth Award.
The Youth Award focuses on teenagers who
have overcome personal adversity and cre-
ated positive changes in their lives and their
community. The program provides businesses,
the community and civic leaders an oppor-
tunity to support young people in their commu-
nities and recognize their accomplishments.
Noah is the perfect recipient for this award be-
cause despite adversities and challenges, he
has become an inspiration and role model for
his peers.
The dedication and leadership demonstrated
by Noah is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and
perseverance. It is essential students at all
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will
guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Noah Falance Martinez for this well-deserved
recognition. I have no doubt he will exhibit the
same dedication and character in all of his fu-
ture accomplishments.

NATIONAL WEEK OF
CONVERSATION
HON. JOYCE BEATTY
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to mark National Week of Conversation.
Right now, we as Americans are no longer
expressing our disagreements in a respectable
way.
Need proof? Turn on the TV or check your
Facebook and Twitter feed.
It’s gotten so bad that 75 percent of Ameri-
cans—across the political spectrum—say the
way we interact with each other has reached
a ‘‘crisis level.’’
Madam Speaker, we need to learn how to
disagree without being disagreeable—and that
begins here in Congress.
That is why Congressman STEVE STIVERS
and I launched the Congressional Civility and
Respect Caucus last year.
We are on a mission to ‘‘Revive Civility’’ and
visiting schools, civic organizations, and busi-
nesses in Central Ohio and D.C. to spread the
message.
I invite all my Democratic and Republican
colleagues to join us in this effort.
Become a member of Congressional Civility
and Respect Caucus and take time this Na-
tional Week of Conversation to ‘‘Listen First.’’
Our families, friends, constituents, and fel-
low Americans are counting on us.
TRIBUTE TO CYNTHIA HUBACH—
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
WOMAN OF THE YEAR
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference
in my Congressional District. I would like to
recognize a remarkable woman, Cynthia
Hubach of the Silver Lake neighborhood of
Los Angeles, California.
Cynthia Hubach grew up exploring nature
and observing wildlife right in her own back-
yard, in the open spaces of the 1960s San
Fernando Valley. From her father Richard, a
rocket scientist and entrepreneur, Ms. Hubach
learned to love and respect nature, developing
a lifelong commitment to protecting and pre-
serving open spaces. From her mother Gail,
who was chief of pharmacy at Canoga Park
Hospital for well over twenty years, Cynthia
learned the crucial values of hard work, self-
reliance, and caring for others.
After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in
English from the University of California,
Berkeley, her parents’ alma mater, Cynthia
took an unusual step into a career in local
news. At KCBS–TV News in Los Angeles,
Cynthia produced the 6 p.m. newscast through
historic periods of civic turmoil and natural dis-
asters. She went on to produce scores of
hours of television, from MTV’s Behind the
Music to several reality shows; most notably
The Apprentice.
In 2010, with her father in the final months
of a long battle with cancer, she decided she
needed to make more of a difference in the
world. That year, she enrolled in a master’s
program at Antioch University in Urban Sus-
tainability. The coursework emphasized the
connections among people, the economy and
the planet, and how certain ‘‘leverage points’’
can have an outsized impact on all three.
Community gardens are just that sort of lever-
age points, so in 2011, Cynthia started work to
convert a quarter acre vacant lot she owned in
Elysian Valley into a thriving community gar-
den.
Cynthia has become increasingly involved in
urban agriculture. She is an active member of
the Master Gardener program and she has
also served as co-chair of the Los Angeles
Food Policy Council’s Urban Agriculture Work-
ing Group. She is a longtime board member
and current Secretary of the Los Angeles
Community Garden Council; an organization
that supports about 40 community gardens
with administrative and programming assist-
ance.
Her love for nature and wildlife extends to
her neighborhood in Silver Lake where she is
the current Vice President of the Silver Lake
Reservoirs Conservancy, which seeks to
beautify the reservoir complex with native
plantings, and responsibly expand areas of
public access.
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Cynthia
Hubach.

Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Jill Anderson for her Congressional
Women of the Year Award and for all the in-
credible work she does to improve the quality
of life on the Central Coast.
Ten years ago, Jill Anderson and her hus-
band founded Shadow’s Fund, an organization
to help find homes for senior and difficult-to-
adopt dogs. Starting the organization with only
a few dogs, they have now grown to caring for
42 dogs on-site and even more in foster
homes. Along the way they established a
sanctuary for those dogs, as well as pigs and
wild horses. Jill has developed programs in
the Lompoc community working with local resi-
dents on dog ownership, as well as bringing
the community to their sanctuary. She also
created a program to rescue Pitbull puppies
from backyard breeders, socialize and train
them, and make them breed ambassadors. Jill
works 60 to 70 hours a week as a volunteer
for Shadow’s Fund, It’s an honor to recognize
Jill’s efforts to make the Central Coast a more
humane place for animals and a happier place
for its residents.

HONORING THE DOTHAN AREA
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
HON. MARTHA ROBY
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the Dothan Area Chamber of Com-
merce on their 100th anniversary. The Dothan
Area Chamber of Commerce is an exceptional
organization that has made enormous con-
tributions to fostering economic development
in the City of Dothan and the surrounding
Houston County area.
Founded in 1919, the organization started
as a small office that helped to establish the
prices of produce and cotton. The organization
has grown over the years and today is com-
promised of over 950 businesses, profes-
sionals, and individuals with the goal of serv-
ing as a catalyst for business and community
growth in the Dothan area.
The Dothan Area Chamber of Commerce
has been successful in their mission and has
created an environment that is attractive to
many diverse businesses and industries. The
Wiregrass region’s economic growth and sta-
bility over 100 years is very impressive and re-
flects the successes of the Dothan Area
Chamber of Commerce.
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to ac-
knowledge the Dothan Area Chamber of Com-
merce for their positive impact on the commer-
cial, financial, civic, agricultural, industrial and
general interests of the Dothan and Houston
County area. We are fortunate to have this or-
ganization in Alabama’s Second District, and I
am looking forward to many more years of
continued growth and success.

Tuesday, April 9, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference
in my Congressional District. I would like to
recognize a remarkable woman, Carrie Ann
Sutkin of the Elysian Valley neighborhood of
Los Angeles, California.
Born in Detroit, Michigan, Carrie Ann lived
there until the age of fifteen, when her step-
father was offered a job as a health agency
administrator in the counties of Alameda and
Contra Costa and her family moved to North-
ern California. After volunteering as a health
worker in the Dominican Republic, Ms. Sutkin
learned the Spanish language at the Univer-
sity of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) and also
in Mexico City where she lived and studied
Latin American politics.
Carrie Ann completed her Bachelor of the
Arts degree at UCSC in 1984 and moved to
Los Angeles in 1986 for her first professional
job in the Department of Spanish and Por-
tuguese at the University of Southern Cali-
fornia. In 1990, she received a Master’s De-
gree in Urban Planning while interning for the
City of Los Angeles Chief Legislative Analyst.
In 1989, Ms. Sutkin joined Gloria Molina’s
campaign for Los Angeles County Supervisor
and after the successful election, joined Su-
pervisor Molina’s staff. Carrie Ann began her
Doctorate in 1995 in Planning and Policy De-
velopment with her Dissertation on how her
Chicana colleagues in the county re-planned
and redeveloped the East Los Angeles Civic
Center and wrote another Dissertation in Plan-
ning and Development on Chicana feminist
planning in 2015. From 2012 to 2018, Ms.
Sutkin represented Los Angeles County on
three Redevelopment Agency Oversight Com-
mittees: Pomona, El Monte and West Covina.
She currently has a thriving consultant prac-
tice for non-profit organizations.
An Elysian Valley resident since 2010,
Carrie Ann became involved in the Elysian
Valley Neighborhood Council in 2015 and was
appointed two years later. She serves as a
member of the steering committee of the Alli-
ance for River Communities and helps the
Atwater Village Neighborhood Council on their
