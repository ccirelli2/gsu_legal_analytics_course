Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 No. 154
House of Representatives

NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
TRONE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the accomplish-
ments of more than 23 million Ameri-
cans who are in recovery.
September is National Recovery
Month. In 2019 we are celebrating 30
years of that designation. We are
marking that today in Congress with
an effort we are calling ‘‘Congress Goes
Purple’’.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my
colleagues DENVER RIGGLEMAN, ANNIE
KUSTER, and BRIAN FITZPATRICK for
partnering with me to make this hap-
pen.
Those among us who are struggling
with mental health concerns or sub-
stance use disorder need to know there
is no shame in seeking help. Their jour-
ney to recovery is something to be
celebrated.
These disorders don’t discriminate,
and neither should we in helping find
people a path back. I came to Congress
to help make recovery a real possi-
bility for more Americans.
Starting in the mid-1990s, we have
seen opioids invade and destroy fami-
lies across America. From the district
I represent in Maryland to big cities
and small towns across the country,
there is not a single community that
has not been fully spared from the dev-
astating effects of the opioid epidemic.
It is a true crisis.
For the first time in 100 years, we
have seen life expectancy decline for 3
straight years in this country. Ameri-
cans are dying sooner than their par-
ents’ generation, and we can blame the
opioid epidemic.
The numbers are staggering. Last
year, we saw over 70,000 people die of a
drug overdose. More Americans have
died in 1 year of drug overdose than
from the wars in Vietnam, Afghani-
stan, and Iraq combined.
Behind each one of those numbers is
a person. Behind each one of those
numbers is a family and a community
that feels the immense pain and loss.
My family was one of those.
In 2016, on New Year’s Eve, my neph-
ew Ian Jacob Trone died of a fentanyl
overdose. He was 24 years old, and he
died alone in his hotel room.
I worked with Ian for over 5 years
while he was struggling with addiction.
We tried treatment centers and half-
way houses and mental health special-
ists. I worked closely with him to do
everything I could to get him the help
he needed, and we still lost him.
Unfortunately, it is not just addic-
tion numbers that are staggering.
SAMHSA estimates in 2017, over 19 mil-
lion people in the U.S. experienced sub-
stance use disorder, but of that group,
8.5 million also had a co-occurring
mental illness.
This is the most important issue in
America. We must act now and stop
more people from losing their lives. I
know if we are going to make a dif-
ference, then all of us, including the
Federal Government, need to act. That
is why, as a new Member of Congress,
ending the opioid addiction epidemic is
my number one priority.
I have started a bipartisan freshman
working group, which is now composed
of 64 lawmakers from 31 States all dedi-
cated to ending this epidemic. To-
gether, we are pushing bills that will
bring consistent funding and resources
to those on the front lines who are
fighting this every day. Most impor-
tantly, we are doing this together, both
Democrats and Republicans. Every ac-
tion we take is bipartisan. We need to
work together if we are going to end
the stigma around mental health and
substance use disorders.
Right now someone suffering from
substance use disorder is being thrown
into jail instead of getting the treat-
ment they need. We need to start treat-
ing this like the disease that it is. In-
stead of locking people up in jail, we
need to reach out and give those that
are struggling a helping hand.
That is why the message of National
Recovery Month is so powerful. We can
be that village. Together, we know this
is a disease, not a crime. Together, we
can put the focus on recovery so that
no one has to do this alone.
Madam Speaker, I pledge to do every-
thing in my power to make sure we end
it. I thank the Representatives wearing
purple today for recognizing the impor-
tance of National Recovery Month.
f
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IS A
CRISIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CUELLAR). The Chair recognizes the
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.
NORMAN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor many Americans who
are forgotten: those who have gone
through difficult times that are now on
a path of recovery.
Substance abuse disorders are run-
ning rampant throughout our commu-
nities all over America. They have
crossed borders of race, ethnicity, gen-
der, and politics. This crisis knows no
bounds, and we are here to bring
awareness to the fact that there is a

way forward for each of these individ-
uals.
I have hosted substance abuse aware-
ness roundtables all across my district
regularly and have heard from folks
who have family, friends, or are them-
selves dealing with substance abuse.
Many of these people you would have
no idea they or people they knew were
struggling.
But they were, Mr. Speaker. And this
is why I rise with my colleagues, both
Democrat and Republican alike, and
wear the color purple today, to show
that through love, care, faith, family,
and community, we can help those
walking through a very, very lonely
valley.
We can uplift those who need it the
most. We are all here to help our broth-
ers and sisters in Christ.
f
THE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO
KNOW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. LEWIS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, today I
come with a heavy heart, deeply con-
cerned about the future of our democ-
racy, and I am not alone.
People approach me everywhere I go,
whether I am traveling back and forth
to Atlanta or around our country. They
believe, they truly believe, that our
Nation is descending into darkness.
They never dreamed that the United
States, once seen as a beacon of hope
and as an inspiration to people striving
for equality and justice, would be fall-
ing into such disgrace. I share their
concerns for the future of our country.
It keeps me up at night. We took an
oath to protect this Nation against all
domestic enemies and foreign enemies.
Sometimes I am afraid to go to sleep
for fear that I will wake up and our de-
mocracy will be gone and never return.
At every turn, this administration
demonstrates complete disdain and dis-
regard for ethics, for the law, and for
the Constitution.
They have lied under oath. They
refuse to account for their actions and
appear before legislative bodies who
have the constitutional right to in-
quire about their activities.
The people have a right to inquire,
they have a right to know.
The people have a right to know
whether they can put their faith and
trust in the outcome of our elections.
They have a right to know whether
the cornerstone of our democracy was
undermined by people sitting in the
White House today.
They have a right to know whether a
foreign power was asked to intervene
in the 2020 election.
They have a right to know whether
the President is using his office to line
his pockets.
Mr. Speaker, the people of this Na-
tion realize that if they had committed
even half of these possible violations,
the Federal Government would be swift
to seek justice.
We cannot delay. We must not wait.
Now is the time to act.
I have been patient while we tried
every other path and used every other
tool.
We will never find the truth unless
we use the power given to the House of
Representatives, and the House alone,
to begin an official investigation as
dictated by the Constitution.
The future of our democracy is at
stake. There comes a time when you
have to be moved by the spirit of his-
tory to take action to protect and pre-
serve the integrity of our Nation.
I believe, I truly believe, the time to
begin impeachment proceedings
against this President has come.
To delay or to do otherwise would be-
tray the foundation of our democracy.
f
THE USMCA NEEDS TO BE
RATIFIED NOW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to urge the House leaders to give
farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and
businessowners the certainty they
need, and ratify the USMCA.
Nearly 1 year ago, the United States,
Mexico, and Canada concluded their
negotiations and released the full text
of a trade agreement.
But I stand here today nearly 1 year
later, and the trade deal with our top
trading partners is stalled.
Why? Well, the Speaker objected to
the trade deal. Those objections were
addressed, and yet the American people
are still waiting.
Mr. Speaker, the USMCA will create
176,000 new American jobs. It will se-
cure open access to markets in Mexico
and Canada, markets critical to Mon-
tana farmers and ranchers.
Ratifying the USMCA should be a
priority for this Congress, not im-
peachment fever.
I again call on the Speaker to work
with the White House to get this trade
deal with our top trading partners
across the finish line.
f
PFAS CONTAMINATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER) for 5
minutes.
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Speaker, across the United States and
in my district, we are seeing more and
more communities threatened with
PFAS contamination.
The proliferation of toxic PFAS
chemicals throughout our environment
is a risk to human health, and as Con-
gress continues to act on this issue, we
must listen to the families and citizens
who have had to live with this con-
tamination.
I cannot imagine the fear of a parent
who has learned that their children’s
drinking water is contaminated with
these harmful chemicals.
That is why earlier this year, I intro-
duced legislation that would prohibit
companies from adjusting PFAS
chemicals at the molecular level to by-
pass environmental protection at the
Environmental Protection Agency.
Turning off the tap for approving new
PFAS chemicals is one step that Con-
gress can take as we work to fully un-
derstand how expansive PFAS con-
tamination is to our environment and
to human health.
Congress must act on this issue,
which is why last month, I convened a
PFAS summit with my friend and col-
league CHRIS PAPPAS to hear from envi-
ronmental advocates, impacted fami-
lies, and community leaders in New
Hampshire who are on the front lines
of cleaning up PFAS contamination.
b 1215
We also heard from experts who are
working on long-term solutions to
cleaning up these ‘‘forever chemicals,’’
and I am pleased to bring some of these
ideas back to Washington as a member
of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS
Task Force. This group has brought to-
gether Democrats and Republicans
from across the country to put the
issue of PFAS contamination front and
center in Washington, D.C.
The PFAS Task Force has already
been effective in advancing important
provisions of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act to help clean up con-
taminated sites and protect service-
members, their families, and first re-
sponders who have been exposed.
As House and Senate leaders begin
conferencing on this bill, it is critical
that the final National Defense Au-
thorization Act includes PFAS provi-
sions from the House- and Senate-
passed bills. Americans have waited
long enough.
Congress has an important oppor-
tunity to pass bipartisan legislation
that will protect veterans, current
servicemembers, firefighters occupa-
tionally exposed to PFAS, and families
in communities impacted by military
PFAS contamination.
This issue is critical to my district
and my State, and I will continue to
work across the aisle with anyone who
is willing to protect communities and
future generations from PFAS con-
tamination.

EXPAND MARKETS FOR AMERICAN
DAIRY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, last month, I had the
pleasure of hosting U.S. Secretary of
Agriculture Sonny Perdue for a dairy
and agriculture summit in Pennsylva-
nia’s 15th District at Mount Aloysius
College in Cresson, Pennsylvania.
Joining the Secretary and I was Gary
Groves, Executive Director of the
USDA Pennsylvania Farm Service

Agency; Russell Redding, Pennsylvania
Department of Agriculture secretary;
and my colleagues Representative JOHN
JOYCE and Representative FRED KEL-
LER, among others.
The purpose of the event was to learn
from our farm families about what is
working, what is not, and where they
need support the most. It was a privi-
lege to host so many hardworking
dairy farmers and to learn from their
experiences.
It is important that there are re-
sources available to help the dairy in-
dustry strengthen and grow. At the
summit, we discussed these resources,
like the USDA’s new Dairy Margin
Coverage Program. Programs like
these are strengthening the safety net
for farm families everywhere nation-
wide.
This revamped, voluntary program is
one of the many tools available to
dairy farmers around the Nation that
offers more options, more flexibility,
and a better return on investment.
Our Nation’s farmers are always
working hard. Owning and operating a
farm is a 24/7, 365-day-a-year job. No
matter where you are from, a strong
agricultural industry benefits each and
every one of our lives.
Of course, the hard work of these
men and women would be lost without
strong market opportunities. We must
do more to expand opportunities for
American dairy products, both domes-
tically and internationally.
That means making pending trade
agreements like the USMCA a reality
by bringing it to a vote in the imme-
diate future because Pennsylvania de-
serves freer markets, fairer trade, and
increased economic opportunity.
As the Commonwealth’s number one
industry, the importance of a strong
agricultural sector cannot be over-
stated. As the largest sector of the
Pennsylvania agricultural industry,
dairy production remains critical.
USMCA brings good news for dairy
farmers in Pennsylvania and across the
country, thanks to the elimination of
Canada’s class 6 and class 7 dairy pric-
ing, which has unfairly limited our ex-
port potential.
Our agricultural industry, particu-
larly our dairy farmers, are the back-
bone of Pennsylvania’s economy, and
their success directly impacts the well-
being of the Commonwealth.
Passing USMCA is long overdue. It is
time to signal to our Nation’s farmers,
manufacturers, small business owners,
and two closest trade partners that we
are serious about securing a bright fu-
ture for American exports.
f
STILL I RISE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise. I rise today with a be-
lief that the Honorable JOHN LEWIS was
eminently correct with his statement.
He does not need my commentary;
hence, I will not give commentary.
I just want the RECORD to reflect
that on September 24, shortly after the
noon hour, I had the preeminent privi-
lege of being here in this very room to
hear the Honorable JOHN LEWIS.
While I won’t comment on his com-
mentary, I will just comment on some-
thing that was on my heart as it re-
lates to people who approach and ask
questions about the state of affairs, the
status of our country.
On yesterday, a young man, 9 years
of age, his name is Alec. Alec is a vari-
ation of Alexander. Alexander means
helper of humankind.
This 9-year-old young man expressed
his concerns about our country—9
years of age. The proof of what I say
can be validated because he was at the
rally that was held right out front of
the Rayburn House Office Building—9
years of age.
People of all ages who have been
chronicling these events are asking
questions. There are many answers to
be given, but I think the Honorable
JOHN LEWIS has given us the best. I am
honored that I was here when he gave
us pearls of wisdom to facilitate our
going forward.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

Loving God, we give You thanks for
giving us another day.
As Members of the people’s House re-
turn to Washington, we ask Your bless-
ing on them that they might be all the
more focused in their work, and as
modeled by so many Americans in
their efforts these past days, prepared
to work together to address our Na-
tion’s most pressing needs.
As a community of colleagues, we
ask Your blessing upon Representative
CLYBURN and his family, who mourn
the loss of his beloved wife, Emily. May
all those who mourn the loss of their

May all that is done this day be for
Your greater honor and glory.

gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms.
KENDRA S. HORN) come forward and
lead the House in the Pledge of Alle-
giance.

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under

nounces to the House that, in light of

ber of the House is 434.

THE FAIR ACT MAKES FORCED
ARBITRATION ILLEGAL
(Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of
the FAIR Act that makes forced arbi-
tration clauses illegal.
As a member of the Armed Services
Committee, I worked to protect serv-
icemembers and their families from
negligently managed base housing and
the contracts they were forced to sign
to keep them quiet. Our servicemem-
bers should have the right to advocate
for themselves.
We cannot hold bad actors account-
able when they can hide in arbitration
proceedings. No one should have to
sign away their right to go to court
after experiencing sexual assault or
discrimination, but that is exactly
what forced arbitration clauses do.
Arbitration can be an option to solve
disagreements without going to court,
but everyone involved should get to
choose. If you downloaded an app,
signed up for a credit card, or signed an
employment contract, you may have
signed away your right to hold some-
one accountable. I don’t believe that
you can sign away your constitutional
rights.
Mr. Speaker, I voted for the FAIR
Act to level the playing field for con-
sumers, small businesses, and workers
across America, and I strongly urge the
Senate to take it up as soon as pos-
sible.

the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to remember the
late Lieutenant, Junior Grade, John
Joseph Wiley and the 129 men trag-
ically lost aboard the USS Thresher.
This submarine departed its port on
April 10, 1963, for a test dive. Unfortu-
nately, it never returned.
John Joseph Wiley of Altoona, Penn-
sylvania, was among the lost. After
graduating from the United States
Naval Academy, he was selected for the
Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit.
The USS Thresher was the first and the
last submarine to which he would re-
port.
This week, a new memorial honoring
those lost aboard the USS Thresher will
be dedicated at Arlington National
Cemetery. More than half a century
after the tragic disaster, our Nation
has not forgotten the sacrifice of Lieu-
tenant John Joseph Wiley and those
Americans who died with him.
f
PFAS CONTAMINATION
(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, in the
richest country in the world, every
American deserves clean drinking
water, but for millions of our fellow
citizens, including many in Michigan
and all across the country, this is just
not their reality.
Hundreds of communities are dealing
with PFAS chemical contamination
that pollutes their drinking water.
Congress has to act to address this
contamination to help keep American
families safe.
Earlier this year, the House and Sen-
ate both passed National Defense Au-
thorization Act bills. Both contain im-
portant provisions meant to address
PFAS chemicals were included in those
bills. These provisions would fund
cleanup of contaminated sites, stop
PFAS from polluting our drinking
water in the future, and ensure that
servicemembers, first responders, and
families exposed to PFAS have the
healthcare they need.
As the co-chair of the congressional
PFAS Caucus, a bipartisan task force
from States across the country, we
worked successfully to include many
PFAS provisions in both the House and
Senate-passed bills.
Now it is critical that the final
NDAA, which is being negotiated right
now, include very strong PFAS provi-
sions. This is what we need to do to
protect public health.
f
HONORING CHANCELLOR CLIFTON
GANUS
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life of Dr. Clif-
ton Ganus, Jr., who passed away earlier
this month at the age of 97 after dedi-
cating 73 years to his alma mater, Har-
ding University, in Searcy, Arkansas.
Dr. Ganus began his journey at Har-
ding College in 1939, majoring in Bible
and history. Soon after graduating, he
began teaching at Harding in 1946, ulti-
mately chairing the History Depart-
ment and serving as Dean.
In 1965, he was elected as Harding’s
third president, leading the then col-
lege to university status and signifi-
cant growth. He served in this role for
22 years, becoming the university’s
first chancellor in 1987 and then chan-
cellor emeritus in 2013.
Throughout this admirable life, Dr.
Ganus traveled to 117 countries, was an
Eagle Scout, and served on the Quapaw
Area Council board. He was an active
member in the Searcy Lions Club for 70
years and an elder at the College
Church of Christ.
He was admired across our State, and
I extend my prayers to his family and
friends across our great State of Ar-
kansas.
f
PFAS CONTAMINATION
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of thousands of fami-
lies in my district that have been ex-
posed to PFAS in their drinking water.
Last week, my friend Michael Hickey
testified before the House on the preva-
lence of PFAS contamination in
Hoosick Falls and in Petersburgh, two
communities in my district.
Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh are
not alone. Hundreds of communities
across the country are dealing with
PFAS contamination.
Here is what we know about these
forever chemicals. PFAS contamina-
tion can cause autoimmune disorders,
thyroid conditions or disorders, and
cancer. It is time for action.
As a named conferee for the National
Defense Authorization Act, I will force-
fully advocate for pretreatment stand-
ards and that PFAS be designated a
hazardous substance.
Too many families are living with
the consequences of PFAS contamina-
tion in our Nation, and it is due in
large part to our inaction.
f
HONORING DR. BRUCE STENDER
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Dr. Bruce Stender
for his exceptional contributions to the
State of Minnesota as an educator,
businessman, and community leader.
From 1975 to 1981, Bruce worked as
the first lay President of the College of
St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minnesota.
At the time of his appointment, he was
the youngest president of any Catholic
college in the United States.
Following his tenure at St.
Scholastica, Bruce joined Labovitz En-
terprises, serving 25 years as president
and CEO. His hard work and success
eventually earned him title of Busi-
nessperson of the Year in 2005 from the
University of Minnesota, Duluth,
Labovitz School of Business and Eco-
nomics.
Committed to the betterment of his
community, Bruce has also served on a
number of healthcare, business, and
statewide boards.
Mr. Speaker, this next month, the
College of St. Scholastica will publicly
honor Bruce’s illustrious career
through the naming of the Stender
School of Business and Technology.
The naming of this department after
Bruce will ensure generations to come
will remember his service and gen-
erosity.
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to see Bruce
receive this recognition, and cannot
think of a better way to celebrate his
life’s work.
f
HONORING MAURICE FERRE
(Ms. SHALALA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
honor my good friend Maurice Ferre,
who was considered the father of mod-
ern-day Miami. He passed away on
Thursday at the age of 84.
Born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, Maurice
championed the power of architectural
beauty and cultural diversity to re-
shape a city.
He served Miami as mayor from 1973
to 1985 and succeeded in transforming
the city into the commercial and cul-
tural center we know today.
Mayor Ferre’s vision of Miami as in-
tegrated and urban, international and
ultramodern is woven into every inch
of our community, from the high-rises
in Brickell to the bayside park that
bears his name.
He was a talented politician and in-
novative entrepreneur and a man of un-
paralleled class and elegance. He con-
tinued to advocate for our city and for
the people of Puerto Rico until his last
days.
His passion, wisdom, and loyalty to
Miami will be missed but never forgot-
ten. He was a true titan of public serv-
ice. I am proud to have called him my
friend.
Mr. Speaker, my thoughts are with
his wife, children, and grandchildren,
and with all those in Miami who will

STUDENTS NEED MORE VIRTUAL
APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1

Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today

prenticeship Tax Credit Act of 2019,
which I introduced last week.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7873
September 24, 2019
Despite booming economic growth as
a result of the American Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, nearly 7 million jobs in
America remain unfilled.
Mr. Speaker, I can’t tell you how
many employers from my district have
struggled to find workers with the
technical competencies to compete for
in-demand, good-paying jobs.
So when it comes to workforce devel-
opment, we need innovative ideas and
partnerships between businesses and
institutions of higher education. That
is why I introduced the Virtual Ap-
prenticeship Tax Credit Act of 2019,
which offers a tax credit to employers
who invest in the funding of virtual ap-
prenticeship programs. It is my hope
this will open more doors for students
from all backgrounds.
When it comes to learning and work-
force development, there shouldn’t be a
one-size-fits-all approach. Put simply,
there needs to be more virtual appren-
ticeship opportunities for our students.

INCLUDE PFAS PROVISIONS IN
NDAA
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to support hundreds of communities
across America, both rural and urban,
that are being forced to endure PFAS
contamination.
Every week, we learn more and more
about the toxicity and ever-widening
scope of this man-made crisis.
Not one but two PFAS sites have
been discovered in my own district, the
13th Congressional District, first seep-
ing from the sewers in Melvindale and
then at the construction site of the
Gordie Howe International Bridge in
Detroit.
As a representative of people living
in those areas, and from the State with
the most PFAS sites in the country, it
is my moral obligation to stand before
you all today and say time is now for
Congress to act. Include provisions to
clean up contaminated sites, to stop
PFAS from polluting our drinking
water in the future, and to protect our
servicemembers and first responders in
the final NDAA that is on its way.
We have waited long enough to help
families whose drinking water is at
risk, who have been exposed to these
toxic chemicals, and whose future is
very much threatened.
f
INCENTIVIZE INNOVATION TO
LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, there is
absolutely no doubt that Americans
pay too much for healthcare. Seventy
percent of Americans agree that low-
ering prescription drug costs should be
a major priority for the legislature.
During August, I participated in a
number of healthcare-related
roundtables with medical professionals
across Pennsylvania’s 12th Congres-
sional District. Those healthcare pro-
fessionals identified a number of ways
to help lower prescription drug costs,
including patent reform that would
help get generics to market quickly
and the need to incentivize innovation
as a means to find more cures.
As such, I am disturbed that my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
have introduced a pricing bill that is
merely for political talking points and,
if enacted, would put this country on
the road toward socialized medicine.
Rather than incentivizing innovation
and patent reform, Democrats have in-
troduced a bill that would increase
taxes and stifle innovation while rais-
ing drug prices, leading to fewer cures.
The American people have demanded
action on lowering healthcare costs.
But, Mr. Speaker, socialized medicine
is not the answer. It is time to work to-
gether on real solutions in the free
market to lower prescription drug
costs and find cures for all Americans.

CONGRATULATING DIAMONDBACK
TRUCK COVERS
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
and congratulate DiamondBack Truck
Covers, a truck bed cover company in
Philipsburg, Pennsylvania. Diamond-
Back was recently awarded the Small
Business Administration’s Pennsyl-
vania Small Business of the Year
Award.
I had the pleasure of traveling back
to Philipsburg to present Diamond-
Back founders Ethan Wendle and Mat-
thew Chverchko with a commendation
for this award. Ethan and Matt were
also recognized as the SBA Persons of
the Year for Pennsylvania.
Ethan and Matt met at Pennsylvania
State University. What started out as
an engineering class project has turned
into a flourishing business.
I am particularly proud that Ethan
and Matt chose to plant roots in
Philipsburg. This sort of commitment
to our local communities is breathing
new life into small town USA. It is
companies like DiamondBack that are
helping small towns bounce back.
The decision to manufacture, mar-
ket, sell, and ship from Philipsburg is
an investment in Pennsylvania’s fu-
ture, in local communities and busi-
nesses, and in the people who call the
Commonwealth home.
f
SUPPORT CLEAN ENERGY WEEK
(Mr. CURTIS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of Clean Energy
Week, an opportunity to celebrate bi-
partisan support for a wide variety of
clean energy sources strengthening
America’s national security while also
preserving our environment for future
generations.
Environmental stewardship doesn’t
have to mean making economic sac-
rifices. Clean energy solutions and jobs
are the future for the United States,
with clean energy powering more
homes and businesses than ever before.
The environment is, and should be, a
bipartisan issue. That is why, this
week, I am proud, with my friend Con-
gressman LOWENTHAL from California,
to offer a resolution in support of con-
gressionally supporting the designation
of Clean Energy Week.
I am proud that our effort has al-
ready gathered dozens of our col-
leagues, bipartisan, on both sides of the
aisle. This goes to show that we can
work across the aisle to be better stew-
ards of this Earth. I plan to continue
pursuit of these positive bipartisan so-
lutions in the future.

FIRST RESPONDERS PASSPORT
ACT OF 2019
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I move to suspend the rules and pass
the bill (H.R. 2229) to waive the pass-
port fees for first responders pro-
ceeding abroad to aid a foreign country
suffering from a natural disaster, as
amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2229
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘First Re-
sponders Passport Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. PASSPORTS FOR FIRST RESPONDERS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (a) of section
1 of the Act of June 4, 1920 (22 U.S.C. 214; 41
Stat. 750; commonly referred to as the ‘‘Pass-
port Act of 1920’’), is amended, in the third
sentence, by inserting after ‘‘to attend a fu-
neral or memorial service for such member;’’
the following: ‘‘at the discretion of the Sec-
retary, from an individual, including a vol-
unteer, who is operating under a contract,
grant, or cooperative agreement with the
United States Government to proceed abroad
within the first seven days after a natural
disaster to aid a foreign country suffering
from such natural disaster;’’.
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 90 days after
the end of the first full fiscal year after the
date of the enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State shall submit to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs of the House of
Representatives and the Committee on For-
eign Relations of the Senate a report on the
number of waivers of fees for the execution
and issuance of passports to first responders
under section 1 of the Act of June 4, 1920, as
amended by subsection (a) of this section, for
such fiscal year.
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS.
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the
purpose of complying with the Statutory
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of
the House Budget Committee, provided that
such statement has been submitted prior to
the vote on passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Michigan.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude in the RECORD extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 2229.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Michigan?
There was no objection.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, let me start by thank-
ing the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.
CHABOT) for his hard work on this legis-
lation. This is a good bill that passed
the House in the 114th Congress, and I
am glad we are considering an updated
version of it now.
USAID-supported search and rescue
teams have played an essential role in
the aftermath of many overseas nat-
ural disasters, including earthquakes
in Nepal, Haiti, Japan, and New Zea-
land. Just this past month, search and
rescue units from Virginia were de-
ployed to the Bahamas to assist the
victims of Hurricane Dorian.
These first responders provide spe-
cialized capabilities and demonstrate
our commitment to international part-
ners during their times of need. They
put their lives on the line to help peo-
ple around the world who are in need,
and by doing so, they demonstrate the
compassion of the American people.
This bill would authorize the Sec-
retary of State, at their discretion, to
waive passport fees for the brave Amer-
icans who mobilize quickly as part of a
U.S. Government-supported team to
help other countries when a natural
disaster strikes.
This is a commonsense fix to help en-
sure the rapid deployment of Ameri-
cans who risk life and limb to help
other countries in their times of need.
It is a good bill that I am proud to sup-
port.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in doing so, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of the First Responders Passport Act,
and I thank the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. CHABOT) for introducing this bill.
Americans who answer the call to
service in response to disasters abroad
are some of the best that America has
to offer. Often first on the scene when
calamity strikes, our fire and rescue
teams are the embodiment of the gen-
erosity of the American people. Their
commitment and sacrifice earn im-
mense goodwill toward our Nation.
This bill will help our first respond-
ers obtain the overseas travel docu-
mentation that they need in a quick
and cost-effective way.
For these reasons, it deserves our
unanimous support, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I am prepared to close, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. CHABOT), a senior member of the
Foreign Affairs Committee and the au-
thor of the First Responders Passport
Act.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
MCCAUL) for yielding, and I rise today
in support of H.R. 2229, the First Re-
sponders Passport Act, legislation I in-
troduced along with Congressman
BOYLE to exempt first responders oper-
ating on behalf of the U.S. Government
from passport fees. This legislation is
especially timely as we just witnessed
Hurricane Dorian’s destruction in the
Bahamas.
Currently, USAID contracts with
first responders to deploy them abroad
for natural disasters, like Hurricane
Dorian. For example, every 5 years,
USAID awards contracts to local fire
departments that have highly trained,
internationally certified urban search
and rescue teams, allowing USAID to
have these specialists on call. A team
of these first responders deployed to
the Bahamas as part of our recent re-
lief efforts there.
To arrive at disaster zones in time,
these teams are required to be able to
deploy the day a disaster strikes. Con-
sequently, they must maintain an ac-
tive passport while they are under con-
tract.
Unfortunately, volunteers or other
members of these teams that are not
deployed by a local or State govern-
ment have to do so at their own ex-
pense, even though they could poten-
tially be traveling on government busi-
ness. My legislation allows the Sec-
retary of State to waive passport fees
for them and other similarly situated
individuals.
Brave first responders sacrifice time
away from their families to go to dis-
aster zones on behalf of the U.S. Gov-
ernment and represent our Nation to
people who have lost everything. As
part of an official U.S. response, the
Federal Government ought to cover the
first responders’ costs.
That is why I am pleased that we
have been able to work in a bipartisan
manner, Democrats and Republicans
working together to bring this legisla-
tion to the House floor, and I urge my
colleagues to support it.
Mr. Speaker, I now turn to the
BURMA Act, legislation that Chairman
ENGEL and I introduced to sanction the
Burmese military for its gross human
rights violations against the Rohingya.
This legislation has already passed
the House twice as part of this year’s
and last year’s NDAA, the National De-
fense Authorization Act. I am pleased
that we can consider it by itself today.
Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, the Bur-
mese military drove over 700,000
Rohingya, many of them children, out
of Rakhine State and into Bangladesh.
This brutal, systematic, premeditated
campaign inflicted unspeakable hor-
rors on the Rohingya, including bar-
baric killings, gang rapes, and the
burning of hundreds and hundreds of
villages.
As a clearer picture emerged over
time, the mounting evidence led the

House to pass legislation that I au-
thored to call these atrocities what
they were—genocide.
It is extremely frustrating that, after
2 years, the Burmese military has faced
very few consequences for these crimes.
That is why we must pass the
BURMA Act today. It would provide
needed tools to ensure greater account-
ability on the Burmese military for
these atrocities.
Lastly, I would like to address any
concern that if we, the United States,
stand up for human rights in Asia, dic-
tators will go scurrying, go running to
China. This entirely misses the point.
Our competition with China is over
whose values will shape the world. If
we have to look the other way on geno-
cide, China has already won.
It is well past time that the BURMA
Act became law, either this version or
the version that this House passed
under the NDAA. Either version is very
good.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support them, and we hope that it is
done in a very timely manner. I sup-
port passage of this legislation.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close.
Mr. Speaker, America’s first respond-
ers represent to the world the human-
ity at the heart of our Nation.
I, again, thank the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) for his expression of
support for their overseas activities,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for purposes of closing.
Mr. Speaker, the First Responders
Passport Act is a good measure that
passed the House in the 114th Congress.
I am glad we are considering it again
today.
This is a straightforward and com-
monsense measure to make sure we can
rapidly deploy American search and
rescue teams to other countries when
disaster strikes.
I urge all Members to join me in sup-
porting this measure, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
LEVIN) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2229, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

SOUTHEAST ASIA STRATEGY ACT
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I move to suspend the rules and pass
the bill (H.R. 1632) to require a strategy
for engagement with Southeast Asia
and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1632
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Southeast
Asia Strategy Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Southeast Asia is the fulcrum of the
Indo-Pacific region, providing both a geo-
graphic and maritime link between East and
South Asia.
(2) The Association of Southeast Asian Na-
tions (ASEAN), a regional intergovern-
mental organization, remains central to the
Indo-Pacific region’s institutional architec-
ture and to United States foreign policy to-
ward the region.
(3) The United States has reaffirmed that
the security and sovereignty of its Southeast
Asian allies and partners, including a strong,
independent ASEAN, remain vital to the se-
curity, prosperity, and stability of the Indo-
Pacific region.
(4) The United States has committed to
continuing to deepen longstanding alliances
and partnerships with a range of Southeast
Asian nations, including by promoting our
shared values, democracy, human rights, and
civil society.
(5) Since the end of the Second World War,
United States investments in strengthening
alliances and partnerships with Southeast
Asian nations have yielded tremendous re-
turns for United States interests, as working
with and through these alliances and part-
nerships have increased the region’s capacity
and capability to address common chal-
lenges.
(6) ASEAN member states are critical
United States security partners in pre-
venting violent extremism and protecting
the freedom and openness of the maritime
domain and in preventing the trafficking of
weapons of mass destruction.
(7) ASEAN member states have contrib-
uted significantly to regional disaster moni-
toring and management and emergency re-
sponse through initiatives such as the
ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humani-
tarian Assistance on Disaster Management,
an inter-governmental organization that fa-
cilitates coordination and cooperation
among ASEAN member states and inter-
national organizations in times of emer-
gency.
(8) According to the 2018 ASEAN Business
Outlook Survey, ASEAN member states are
vital to the prosperity of the United States
economy and exports to ASEAN economies
support more than 500,000 jobs in the United
States.
(9) The United States and ASEAN have re-
cently celebrated the 40th anniversary of
their ties and established a new strategic
partnership that will enhance cooperation
across the economic, political-security, and
people-to-people pillars of the relationship.
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
It is the policy of the United States to—
(1) deepen cooperation with ASEAN and
ASEAN member states in the interest of pro-
moting peace, security, and stability in the
Indo-Pacific region;
(2) affirm the importance of ASEAN cen-
trality and ASEAN-led mechanisms in the
evolving institutional architecture of the
Indo-Pacific region; and

prehensive strategy toward the Indo-Pacific
region that articulates—
(A) the role and importance of Southeast
Asia to the United States;

relationship;
(C) the mutual interests of all parties;
(D) the concrete and material benefits all
nations derive from strong United States en-
gagement and leadership in Southeast Asia;
and
(E) efforts to forge and maintain ASEAN
consensus, especially on key issues of polit-
ical and security concern to the region, such
as the South China Sea.

Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-

clude in the RECORD extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 1632.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-

Mr. Speaker, let me start by thank-
ing the gentlewoman from Missouri
(Mrs. WAGNER), the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. CASTRO), and the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. YOHO) for intro-
ducing this legislation.
Southeast Asian states and the Asso-
ciation of Southeast Asian Nations, or
ASEAN, have been central to American
policy in Asia for decades. They are
key partners in advancing our interests
in the Indo-Pacific.
But at this point, the Trump admin-
istration still hasn’t put together a
comprehensive strategy on how to
strengthen our engagement with these
countries. This legislation would re-
quire such a strategy.
It calls on the Secretary of State,
working with the Secretaries of De-
fense and Commerce, to come up with a
plan that will make sure the United
States and our partners are working
together on some of the most critical
issues we are facing, from climate
change and human rights to security
cooperation, energy, and a growing
global economy.
A multiyear strategy for our engage-
ment with ASEAN and its member
states will help us build partnerships in
the region focused on short-term chal-
lenges, as well as longer term opportu-
nities. Many Southeast Asian countries
face the same global challenges that
we do, like terrorism and human traf-
ficking. The United States can and
should be their preferred partner to ad-
dress these issues.
This bill will help us take stock of
our ongoing and planned efforts in
these areas and determine what stra-
tegic personnel and funding resources
are necessary to make these efforts
successful.
Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straight-
forward piece of legislation. I am glad
the House is considering it today, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of Congresswoman WAGNER’s
Southeast Asia Strategy Act.
This bill will promote U.S. coopera-
tion with the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and establish a com-
prehensive interagency strategy for en-
gagement in Southeast Asia.
ASEAN is the center of Asia’s stra-
tegic and economic future and critical
to the administration’s Indo-Pacific
strategy. Southeast Asia has been a
critical global crossroads for hundreds
of years, and it is growing even more
important in the 21st century. Trillions
in trade pass through regional sea-
lanes, including vital energy supplies
for U.S. allies and adversaries.
China’s territorial aggression in the
South China Sea and its predatory Belt
and Road Initiative are central to the
region’s geopolitics. Southeast Asia’s
rising economies are becoming impor-
tant drivers of regional growth as its
developed economies begin to slow.
The Southeast Asia Strategy Act is a
welcome step to ensure that this crit-
ical region receives the interagency
focus that it deserves and that it re-
quires.
Mr. Speaker, therefore, I urge my
colleagues to support this measure, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
b 1515
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Mrs. WAGNER), the vice ranking
member of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs and the author of the Southeast
Asia Strategy Act.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the ranking member, Mr. MCCAUL, for
yielding to me and for his strong sup-
port on this piece of legislation, along
with the chairman of the full com-
mittee, Mr. ENGEL, for bringing H.R.
1632, the Southeast Asia Strategy Act,
to a vote.
I also thank Congressman CASTRO for
his persistent support of U.S.-ASEAN
relations, and I urge my colleagues to
join us in passing this important,
straightforward, and commonsense
piece of legislation.
Southeast Asia is of deep strategic
and economic importance to the United
States, and its global influence is, in
fact, growing.
In 2015, the United States and
ASEAN elevated our relationship into
a strategic partnership. To fully realize
this partnership, the U.S. needs a
proactive, coherent regional strategy
that addresses all aspects of the rela-
tionship, from trade and humanitarian
goals to diplomatic and security ar-
rangements.
The Southeast Asia Strategy Act en-
sures that it is the policy of the United
States to coordinate with ASEAN and
its member states in the interest of
promoting peace, security, and sta-
bility.
The legislation instructs the Sec-
retary of State to develop a com-
prehensive strategy for engagement
with the region, including information
on alliances and partnerships, invest-
ment, development, security coopera-
tion, energy security, human rights,
and capacity building on enforcing
international law and sanctions and
creating more open, reliable routes for
trade.
I have had many opportunities to
meet with ASEAN officials and foreign
ministers, and one message I hear re-
peatedly is that the United States
must demonstrate strength and leader-
ship.
Congress should listen closely to our
allies demanding stronger leadership,
and not just because China would be
sure to fill any vacuum in power.
ASEAN is a powerhouse and an end
in itself, and this bill will ensure that
U.S.-ASEAN engagement becomes ever
more fruitful.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the Southeast Asia Strategy
Act.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, I would like to thank Congress-
woman WAGNER, the vice ranking
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, for introducing the Southeast
Asia Strategy Act.
The administration’s national secu-
rity strategy has recommitted the
United States to great power competi-
tion, and the People’s Republic of
China is our primary strategic compet-
itor.
The Indo-Pacific region is at the cen-
ter of this competition, and Southeast
Asia is at the center of the Indo-Pa-
cific.
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge
my colleagues to support the bill, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing.
Mr. Speaker, let me first thank my
colleagues who have taken part in this
debate. I thank the gentlewoman from
Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER) and the rank-
ing member, Mr. MCCAUL, for their
leadership in this area.
I want to just close by being clear
with ourselves as a Congress, as the
United States of America. If we are not
engaged in the Indo-Pacific region, if
we are not building bridges of friend-
ship and cooperation, if we are not
bringing American leadership and
American values to this critical part of
the world, who is going to fill the void?
The answer is easy. It is China.
We can’t be muddling our way
through when it comes to our policy.
We need a smart, proactive approach
that meets current challenges and
builds the framework for successful,
long-term engagement.
Mr. Speaker, this bill will help us
meet those goals. I am pleased to sup-
port it. I urge all Members to do the
same, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
LEVIN) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1632, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.

A motion to reconsider was laid on

f
BURMA POLITICAL PRISONERS
ASSISTANCE ACT
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I move to suspend the rules and pass
the bill (H.R. 2327) to direct the Sec-
retary of State to provide assistance to
civil society organizations in Burma
that work to secure the release of pris-
oners of conscience and political pris-
oners in Burma, and assistance to cur-
rent and former prisoners of conscience
and political prisoners in Burma, and
for other purposes, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2327
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Burma Po-
litical Prisoners Assistance Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Aung San Suu Kyi and the National
League for Democracy (NLD) pledged that
they ‘‘would not arrest anyone as political
prisoners’’, but have failed to fulfill this
promise since they took control of Burma’s
Union Parliament and the Government’s ex-
ecutive branch in April 2016.
(2) As of the end of April 2019, there were
331 political prisoners in Burma, 48 of them
serving sentences, 90 awaiting trial inside
prison, and 193 awaiting trial outside prison,
according to the Assistance Association for
Political Prisoners in Burma.
(3) During its three years in power, the
NLD Government has provided pardons for
Burma’s political prisoners on six occasions.
State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi took
steps to secure the release of nearly 235 po-
litical prisoners in April 2016. On May 23,
2017, former President Htin Kyaw granted
pardons to 259 prisoners, including 89 polit-
ical prisoners. On April 17, 2018, current
President Win Myint pardoned 8,541 pris-
oners, including 36 political prisoners. In
April and May 2019, he pardoned more than
23,000 prisoners, including 20 political pris-
oners.
(4) The Burmese security forces have used
colonial-era laws to arrest and charge polit-
ical prisoners and prisoners of conscience.
These laws include but are not limited to
provisions of the Penal Code, the Peaceful
Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act, the
1908 Unlawful Associations Act, the 2013
Telecommunications Act, and the 1923 Offi-
cial Secrets Act.
(5) On December 12, 2017, Reuters reporters
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested and
charged with violating the Official Secrets
Act, continuing a trend of restricting media
and free speech and attempting to thwart
coverage of the events in Rakhine State.
(6) On September 3, 2018, Wa Lone and
Kyaw Soe Oo were convicted and sentenced
to seven years in prison. Time Magazine in-
cluded pictures of the two reporters on the
cover of its ‘‘Person of the Year’’ issue on
December 10, 2018, as two of the ‘‘Guardians
and the War on Truth’’.
(7) On May 6, 2019, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe
Oo were released after more than 500 days be-
hind bars.
(8) According to Burmese free speech orga-
nization Athan, 44 journalists and 142 activ-
ists since 2016 were charged with colonial-era
laws used to stifle dissent and restrict activ-
ist groups and have faced trial.
(9) Since December 2018, three Kachin ac-
tivists were sentenced to six months in pris-
on in connection with peaceful antiwar pro-
tests; a protester demonstrating against the
Myitsone Dam (a controversial Chinese-
backed hydropower project) was charged for
peaceful demonstrations, and police used ex-
cessive force to crack down on peaceful pro-
testers in Kayah State, with some of the
demonstrators charged under vaguely word-
ed, repressive laws.
(10) On August 18, 2017, Aung Ko Htwe was
arrested because he gave a media interview
in which he described his experience as a
child soldier, including how the Burmese
military abducted and forcibly recruited him
when he was 13 years old. He was charged
under Section 505(b) of Burma’s Penal Code.
(11) Although former Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson took Burma off the State De-
partment’s list of the worst offenders in the
use of child soldiers in 2017, the Department
reinstated Burma to the list in 2018. Accord-
ing to the United Nations, the Burmese mili-
tary and ethnic guerrilla groups remain
‘‘persistent perpetrators’ in the recruitment
and use of children in [Burma].’’.
SEC. 3. CHILD SOLDIERS.
It is the sense of Congress that no one
should be jailed for freely expressing him or
herself or for speaking against the use of
child soldiers.
SEC. 4. PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY.
It is the sense of Congress that Burma
must immediately drop defamation charges
against the three Kachin activists, Lum
Zawng, Nang Pu, and Zau Jet, who led a
peaceful rally in Mytkyina, the capital of
Kachin State in April 2018, and that the pros-
ecution of Lum Zawng, Nang Pu, and Zau Jet
is an attempt by the Burmese authorities to
intimidate, harass, and silence community
leaders and human rights defenders who
speak out about military abuses and the im-
pact on civilian populations.
SEC. 5. PRESS FREEDOM.
It is the sense of Congress that press free-
dom is a fundamental human right and
should be upheld and protected in Burma and
everywhere, and that Burmese authorities
must immediately cease the arbitrary arrest,
detention, imprisonment, and physical at-
tacks of journalists, which have created a
climate of fear and self-censorship among
local journalists.
SEC. 6. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
It is the policy of the United States that—
(1) all prisoners of conscience and political
prisoners in Burma should be uncondition-
ally and immediately released;
(2) the Administration and the Department
of State should use all of their diplomatic
tools to ensure that all prisoners of con-
science and political prisoners in Burma are
released; and
(3) the Burmese Government should repeal
or amend all laws that violate the rights to
freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, or
association, and ensure that laws such as the
Telecommunications Law of 2013 and the Un-
lawful Associations Act of 1908, and laws re-
lating to the right to peaceful assembly, all
comply with international human rights
standards.
SEC. 7. POLITICAL PRISONERS ASSISTANCE.
The Secretary of State shall continue to
provide assistance to civil society organiza-
tions in Burma that work to secure the re-
lease of prisoners of conscience and political
prisoners in Burma, and assistance to cur-
rent and former prisoners of conscience and
political prisoners in Burma. Such assistance
may include the following:
(1) Support for the documentation of
human rights violations with respect to pris-
oners of conscience and political prisoners.
(2) Support for advocacy in Burma to raise
awareness of issues relating to prisoners of
conscience and political prisoners.
(3) Support for efforts to repeal or amend
laws that are used to imprison individuals as
either prisoners of conscience or political
prisoners.
(4) Support for health, including mental
health, and post-incarceration assistance in
gaining access to education and employment
opportunities or other forms of reparation to
enable former prisoners of conscience and
political prisoners to resume a normal life.
(5) The creation, in consultation with
former political prisoners and prisoners of
conscience, their families, and representa-
tives, of an independent prisoner review
mechanism in Burma to review the cases of
individuals who may have been charged or
deprived of their liberty for peacefully exer-
cising their human rights, review all laws
used to arrest, prosecute, and punish individ-
uals as political prisoners and prisoners of
conscience, and provide recommendations to
the Burmese Government for the repeal or
amendment of all such laws.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Michigan.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include in the RECORD ex-
traneous material on H.R. 2327.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Michigan?
There was no objection.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of my bill, the Burma Political Pris-
oners Assistance Act.
Next week, I will travel to Ban-
gladesh, where I am going to spend
time in Cox’s Bazar, the site of the
world’s largest refugee settlement.
Since August of 2017, hundreds of thou-
sands of Rohingya refugees have fled to
Cox’s Bazar from Burma, where vil-
lages were burned to the ground,
women and girls were raped, and many
were massacred at the hands of Bur-
mese security forces as part of a cam-
paign that can only be described as
genocide.
When I come home to the United
States, I plan to speak openly and hon-
estly about what I saw and share the
stories of Rohingya refugees I talk to.
And, while I don’t expect everyone to
like what I have to say, I know that,
here in America, I won’t be persecuted
for exercising my right to free speech
and sharing an honest account of the
atrocities so many have experienced in
Burma.
But, if Burma was my home country,
I would not be able to rest so easy, no
matter my ethnic group or religion.
That is because colonial-era laws are
used to stifle dissent and imprison peo-
ple who dare to speak out or work to
protect human rights.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7878 September 24, 2019
Take the example of Wa Lone and
Kyaw Soe Oo, Reuters journalists who
were arrested while investigating a
massacre of Rohingya men and boys
and spent more than 500 days in prison
before being released after massive
international pressure earlier this
year; or, Aung Ko Htwe, a former child
soldier who gave an interview talking
about his experience being abducted
and forcibly recruited by the Burmese
military when he was just 13 years old.
For that offense, he was imprisoned for
2 years and just released earlier this
month.
Were it not for incredibly brave peo-
ple like Wa Lone, Kyaw Soe Oo, and
Aung Ko Htwe, the world might not
know about the horrors that have oc-
curred in Burma.
Journalists, activists, and anyone
who is willing to use their voice to call
out wrongdoing must be protected.
That is why Congresswoman ANN WAG-
NER and I introduced the Burma Polit-
ical Prisoners Assistance Act.
This bill calls for the release of polit-
ical prisoners and prisoners of con-
science in Burma and directs our State
Department to bolster its work to
achieve these ends.
We need to support efforts to amend
or repeal the unjust laws that are being
used to stifle free expression and hon-
est reporting. We should support the
creation of an independent prisoner re-
view mechanism to examine cases like
the ones I just mentioned and offer rec-
ommendations as to how the law might
better protect free expression. And we
must aid the organizations that are
working to secure the release of polit-
ical prisoners and prisoners of con-
science.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting this important
bill, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of the Burma Political Pris-
oners Assistance Act, introduced by
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
LEVIN) and the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Mrs. WAGNER).
True to our founding ideals, the
United States must continue to stand
as a beacon of hope and freedom in the
world. This includes voicing our sup-
port for political prisoners who are in
chains only because of their peaceful
dissent.
Although recent years have seen
elections in Burma, the human rights
situation there still remains grave.
Burma’s brutal military remains con-
stitutionally immune from civilian
oversight or control. It still has not
been held responsible for the unspeak-
able, bloody genocide against Burma’s
Rohingya population 2 years ago,
which displaced hundreds of thousands
of people in Bangladesh and India.
Criticizing the government remains a
dangerous business in Burma. A lot of
things can get you thrown into jail, or
worse: honest reporting about military
violence against ethnic minorities,
telling the truth about the use of child
soldiers, or expressing political dissent,
among other things.
As a result, there are hundreds of
prisoners of conscience in Burma. All
people deserve fundamental rights of
speech and political expression and to
be free from arbitrary imprisonment.
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I am
pleased to support this bipartisan bill
before us today. The brutal Burmese
military continues to exercise outsized
influence over the government in that
country and tramples the rights of
many who dare to dissent. True to
American ideals, this measure ex-
presses our solidarity and concern for
political prisoners in Burma and, real-
ly, throughout the world, and it de-
serves our full support.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague
on the other side of the aisle, Mr.
LEVIN, for his strong, bipartisan sup-
port for this measure, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing.
Mr. Speaker, I am so happy that, be-
tween the day we introduced this legis-
lation and today, Wa Lone, Kyaw Soe
Oo, and Aung Ko Htwe were released,
but there are so many other people like
them whose names we do not know but
to whom we owe tremendous gratitude
for their bravery.
For the courageous people of Burma
who have raised their voices to insist
on accountability, to demand reform
and bring justice to light, I hope this
legislation helps to bring about the
change they so richly deserve.
I want to thank Congresswoman ANN
WAGNER for her partnership on this bill
and for all her work to protect human
rights in Southeast Asia. I hope this
bill is the first of many we work on to-
gether.
And I thank Chairman ENGEL and
Ranking Member MCCAUL for
prioritizing this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to
join me in supporting this measure,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
LEVIN) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2327, as

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the

(5) WAR CRIME.—The term ‘‘war crime’’ has

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) On August 25, 2017, Burmese military
and security forces violently and dispropor-
tionately responded to an attack on security
outposts, resulting in a mass exodus of
Rohingya from the Rakhine State of Burma
into Bangladesh, which the International Or-
ganization of Migration called ‘‘unprece-
dented in terms of volume and speed’’.
(2) Between August 2017 and March 2019, in
response to the violence perpetrated by the
Burmese military and security forces, the
United Nations estimates more than 740,000
Rohingya, approximately 75 percent of whom
are women and children, have fled to Ban-
gladesh, fearing loss of life, livelihoods, and
shelter. Rohingya have continued to flee
Burma in significant numbers, including in
2019. According to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, more than 1,400
Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh since
January 1, 2019.
(3) Even after the Burmese military scaled
back attacks against Rohingya in late 2017,
security forces continued to impose restric-
tions on the basic freedoms of Rohingya in
Rakhine State, including on freedom of
movement. In November 2017, Amnesty
International determined that Rohingya re-
maining in Rakhine are ‘‘trapped in a vicious
system of state-sponsored, institutionalized
discrimination that amounts to apartheid’’.
(4) Despite the steps taken toward democ-
racy in Burma, there exists limited control
by the civilian government over civilian
agencies as well as military and security
forces that carried out the violence in
Rakhine State. The military and security
forces continue to engage in grave human
rights abuses against ethnic minorities
throughout in the country.
(5) Both government- and military-initi-
ated investigations into human rights abuses
in Burma involving violence between ethnic
minorities and Burmese security forces have
failed to yield credible results or hold per-
petrators accountable.
(6) In a public address on October 12, 2017,
State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi laid out
the following goals for the State of Rakhine:
(A) Repatriation of those who have crossed
over to Bangladesh.
(B) Effective provision of humanitarian as-
sistance.
(C) Resettlement of displaced populations.
(D) Economic development and durable
peace.
(7) Due to restrictions enforced by the
Rakhine State government and the national
military and security forces, there has been
little progress made since that time and lim-
ited ability for the international community
to support, verify, or evaluate the Govern-
ment of Burma’s efforts. There are also cred-
ible reports of Burmese military and secu-
rity forces bulldozing numerous villages
where violence occurred, thus destroying
physical evidence, and in some cases, con-
structing new military installations on top
of the bulldozed villages.
(8) On November 22, 2017, former Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson stated that ‘‘After a
careful and thorough analysis of available
facts, it is clear that the situation in north-
ern Rakhine state constitutes ethnic cleans-
ing against the Rohingya. Those responsible
for these atrocities must be held account-
able’’. He also said the violence ‘‘has a num-
ber of characteristics of certainly crimes
against humanity’’. Despite repeated re-
quests from Members of Congress, as well as
the result of its own investigation (the exec-
utive summary of which was released on Sep-
tember 17, 2018), the Department has de-
clined to make a determination if the atroc-
ities in Rakhine State constitute genocide or
crimes against humanity.
(9) On December 12, 2017, Wa Lone and
Kyaw Soe Oo, two Reuters reporters cov-
ering the crisis in Rakhine State, were en-
trapped, arrested, and charged with violating
the Official Secrets Act, continuing a trend
of restricting media and free speech and at-
tempting to thwart coverage of the events in
Rakhine State.
(10) Another barrier to the voluntary, safe,
dignified and sustainable return of the
Rohingya to Rakhine State is the refusal of
the Government of Burma to reinstate the
full citizenship of the Rohingya, as well as
the Government’s unwillingness to consider
the repeal of or amendments to the Citizen-
ship Act of 1982 that stripped the Rohingya
of their full citizenship.
(11) During 2018, the ongoing conflict in
Burma escalated in Kachin and Shan States,
reignited in Karen (Kayin) State, and spread
into Chin and Rakhine States. Along with
the increase in fighting between Burma’s se-
curity forces and several ethnic armed orga-
nizations, there was a rise in allegations of
human rights abuses perpetrated by Burmese
security forces in these conflict areas.
(12) In April 2018, thousands of civilians
fled fighting between the military and ethnic
armed groups in Kachin State, prompting
peaceful demonstrations. In December 2018,
three prominent activist in Kachin State,
Lum Zawng, Nang Pu and Zau Jet were con-
victed and sentenced to six months imprison-
ment for defaming the military.
(13) On June 6, 2018, the United Nations
Refugee Agency and the United Nations De-
velopment Programme signed a tripartite
Memorandum of Understanding with Burma.
The Office of the United Nations High Com-
missioner for Refugees and various inter-
national human rights and international re-
lief agencies agreed that conditions in
Rakhine State are not sufficient for the vol-
untary, safe, dignified, and sustainable re-
turn of the Rohingya.
(14) The United Nations Independent Inter-
national Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar,
the Department of State, and more than a
dozen human rights organizations have re-
ported and documented a campaign of vio-
lence perpetrated by the security forces of
Burma, which indiscriminately fired on and
killed civilians, raped women and girls, and
arrested Rohingya men without any cause or
charges. Satellite images obtained by Am-
nesty International reveal that, out of the
approximately 470 villages in northern
Rakhine State, nearly 300 were partially or
completely destroyed by fire since August 25,
2017, most of which were completely or par-
tially populated by Rohingya Muslims.
(15) In its report of September 17, 2018, the
United Nations Independent International
Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar deter-
mined that there was sufficient evidence of
‘‘genocidal intent’’ in the attacks against
the Rohingya in Rakhine State, and probable
‘‘crimes against humanity’’ and ‘‘war
crimes’’ in Burmese security forces assaults
on ethnic minorities in Kachin and Shan
States. The Mission recommended that the
United Nations Security Council ‘‘should en-
sure accountability for crimes under inter-
national law committed in Myanmar, pref-
erably by referring the situation to the
International Criminal Court or alter-
natively by creating an ad hoc international
criminal tribunal’’. The Mission also rec-
ommended the imposition of targeted eco-
nomic sanctions, including an arms embargo
on Burma.
(16) On September 3, 2018, Wa Lone and
Kyaw Soe Oo were convicted and sentenced
to seven years in prison and released as an
act of Presidential amnesty on May 6, 2019,
after over 500 days in jail. Time Magazine in-
cluded pictures the two reporters on the
cover of its ‘‘Person of the Year’’ issue on
December 10, 2018, as two of the ‘‘Guardians
and the War on Truth’’.
(17) According to the free-speech organiza-
tion Athan, 44 journalists and 142 activists
have faced trial since 2016 charged with colo-
nial-era laws used to stifle dissent, while
tightening restrictions on activist groups.
(18) On September 28, 2018, the United Na-
tions Human Rights Council passed a resolu-
tion that calls for an independent mecha-
nism to collect and analyze evidence in re-
gard to the serious international crimes
committed in Burma against Rohingya Mus-
lims and other minorities since 2011. The res-
olution requests that the independent mech-
anism ‘‘prepare files in order to facilitate
and expedite fair and independent criminal
proceedings, in accordance with inter-
national law standards, in national, regional
or international courts or tribunals that
have or may in the future have jurisdiction
over these crimes’’.
(19) On November 15, 2018, the Government
of Bangladesh and the Government of Burma
abandoned plans to return more than 2,000
Rohingya to Rakhine State after it was de-
termined that none were willing to volun-
tarily return given the current conditions in
Rakhine State, as well as the Government of
Burma’s failure to ensure the returnees’
safety, dignity, or sustainability of their
livelihoods.
(20) A December 2018 report by the Public
Law Interest & Policy group noted that ‘‘the
destruction of their villages, crops, and vir-
tually all infrastructure clearly points to a
strategy of ensuring the Rohingya’s perma-
nent removal. The mass killings and accom-
panying brutality, including against chil-
dren, women, pregnant women, the elderly,
and those crossing the border to Bangladesh
further suggest, however, that, at least in
the minds of some perpetrators, the goal was
not only to expel, but also to exterminate
the Rohingya . . .’’ and that ‘‘there are rea-
sonable grounds to believe that crimes
against humanity, genocide, and war crimes
have been committed against the Rohingya
in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine State’’.
(21) Despite substantial evidence of wide-
spread and systematic atrocities committed
by Burmese security forces in Rakhine
State, State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi
and Burma’s Commander-in-Chief Senior
General Min Aung Hlaing continue to main-
tain that no such widespread and systematic
atrocities occurred.
(22) On December 13, 2018, the United
States House of Representatives passed
House Resolution 1091 (115th Congress) which
expressed the sense of the House that ‘‘the
atrocities committed against the Rohingya
by the Burmese military and security forces
since August 2017 constitute crimes against
humanity and genocide’’ and called upon the

evidence and make a similar determination.
(23) On December 19, 2018, the United Na-
tions Humanitarian Coordinator requested
$202,000,000 for the 2019 Humanitarian Re-
sponse Plan for Burma.
(24) The 2019 Joint Response Plan for the
Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis asks the
international community to provide
$20,500,000 in assistance to meet needs in
Bangladesh.
(25) On May 14, 2019, the United Nations
Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar urged all
countries to cut off economic ties to Burma’s
military-owned businesses, stating ‘‘. . . due
to the gravity of past and continuing viola-
tions, attention must be given to the polit-
ical, economic and financial ties of the
Myanmar military . . . so we can cut off the
money supply as a means of increasing pres-
sure and reducing the violence.’’.

CONFLICT IN BURMA
SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
It is the policy of the United States as fol-
lows:
(1) To support a complete transition to de-
mocracy and genuine national reconciliation
in Burma, including accountability for the
atrocities committed by the Burmese mili-
tary against the Rohingya population and
other ethnic minorities throughout the
country.

calibrated engagement, which is essential to
support the establishment of a peaceful,
prosperous, and democratic Burma that in-
cludes respect for the human rights of all its
people regardless of ethnicity and religion.
(3) To ensure that the guiding principles of
such a strategy include—
(A) supporting legal reforms, removing re-
maining restrictions on civil and political
rights, and ensuring civilian governance, in-
cluding reforms to the current constitu-
tional provision reserving 25 percent of par-
liamentary seats for appointments by the
military, which provides the military with
veto power over constitutional amendments;
(B) establishing a fully democratic, plural-
istic, and representative political system
that includes free, fair, and democratic elec-
tions in which all people of Burma can vote;
(C) promoting national reconciliation and
the conclusion of a nationwide cease-fire
agreement, including the development of a
political system that is inclusive of ethnic
Rohingya, Shan, Kachin, Chin, Karen, and
other ethnic groups, measures to address
natural resource governance, revenue-shar-
ing, land rights, and constitutional change
enabling inclusive peace;
(D) ensuring accountability through inde-
pendent international investigations of
genocide, war crimes, and crimes against hu-
manity, including sexual and gender-based
violence, perpetrated against the Rohingya
and other ethnic minorities by the military
and security forces of Burma, violent ex-
tremist groups and other combatants in-
volved in the conflict;
(E) strengthening Burma’s civilian govern-
mental institutions, including support for
greater transparency and accountability;
(F) encouraging the establishment of pro-
fessional military, security, and police forces
that operate under civilian control and are
held accountable for human rights abuses,
corruption, or other abuses of power;
(G) combating corruption and illegal eco-
nomic activity, including that which in-
volves the military and its close allies;
(H) empowering local communities, civil
society, and independent media;
(I) encouraging the provision of full citi-
zenship for the Rohingya population in
Burma, as well as durable solutions for those
displaced in Bangladesh;
(J) promoting responsible international
and regional engagement;
(K) strengthening respect for and protec-
tion of human rights and religious freedom;
and
(L) promoting broad-based, inclusive eco-
nomic development and fostering healthy
and resilient communities.

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) significant and sustained international
funding, from both public and private

ing the Rohingya crisis one of its top prior-
ities in its engagement with regional institu-
tions, such as the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations.

cooperate with the ongoing international
mechanism set up by the United Nations
Human Rights Council in September 2018 and
funded by the United Nations General As-
sembly to gather evidence and other infor-

the dignified, safe, sustainable and voluntary
return of all those displaced from their
homes, especially from Rakhine State, with-
out an unduly high burden of proof; and
(D) offer compensation or restitution to
those refugees who do not want to return to
their homes.
(2) BANGLADESH.—Congress calls on the

community, including the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, to ensure
that any repatriation or resettlement of ref-
ugees be dignified, safe, sustainable and vol-
untary; and

TITLE III—GOVERNANCE OF THE BUR-
MESE MINING AND GEMSTONE SECTORS
SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE MINING
SECTOR OF BURMA.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) In 2015, the nongovernmental organiza-
tion Global Witness estimated that the value
of total production of jade in Burma in 2014
was $31,000,000,000, almost 48 percent of the
official gross domestic product of Burma. As
much as 80 percent of that jade sold is smug-
gled out of Burma.
(2) Burma’s military and associated enti-
ties, including companies owned or con-
trolled by Myanmar Economic Corporation
and Myanmar Economic Holding Limited,
their affiliated companies, and companies
owned or controlled by current and former
senior military officers or their family mem-
bers, are linked to the mining sector, includ-
ing the gemstone industry, and benefit finan-
cially from widespread illegal smuggling of
jade and rubies from Burma.
(3) Illegal trafficking in precious and
semiprecious stones from Burma, including
the trade in high-value jade and rubies, de-
prives the people of Burma and the civilian
government of critical revenue and instead
benefits military-linked entities, non-state
armed groups, and transnational organized
criminal networks.
(4) In 2016, the Government of Burma began
to take steps to reform aspects of the mining
sector, including—
(A) improving governance in the gemstone
industry, by temporarily suspending the
issuance or renewal of jade and gemstone
mining permits;
(B) commissioning an environmental man-
agement plan for some mining areas; and
(C) establishing the multi-stakeholder
Jade and Gemstone Support Committee
under the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environmental Conservation to develop rec-
ommendations for a new industry-wide pol-
icy and limited gemstone payment disclo-
sures under the Myanmar Extractives Indus-
try Transparency Initiative.
(5) In January 2019, the Government of
Burma adopted a new Gemstone Law that
does not adequately address corruption and
tax avoidance, conflicts of interest, or the
factors fueling conflict in Kachin State and
other gemstone mining areas.
(6) The lifting in October 2016 of United
States sanctions on the importation of jade
and jadeite and rubies from Burma allowed
such gemstones to legally enter the United
States market, but some retailers have re-
frained from sourcing gemstones of Burmese
origin due to governance and reputational
concerns.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) notwithstanding Burma’s ‘‘Trafficking
in Persons’’ ranking, the President should
continue to provide assistance to Burma,
pursuant to the waiver authority under sec-
tion 110(d)(4) of the Trafficking Victims Pro-
tection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7107(d)(4)), in
order to re-engage with the Government of
Burma with respect to the mining sector and
should make available technical, capacity-
building and other assistance through the
Department of State or the United States
Agency for International Development to
support the Government of Burma in efforts
to reform the gemstone industry; and
(2) companies that seek to import to the
United States gemstones or minerals that
may be of Burmese origin or articles of jew-
elry containing such gemstones should—
(A) obtain such materials exclusively from
entities that satisfy the transparency cri-
teria described in section section 302(b)(2) or
from third parties that can demonstrate that
they sourced the materials from entities
that meet such criteria; and
(B) undertake robust due diligence proce-
dures in line with the ‘‘Due Diligence Guid-
ance for Responsible Business Conduct’’ and
‘‘Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Af-
fected and High-Risk Areas’’ promulgated by
the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development.

owned enterprises operating in such sector,
including through parliamentary oversight
or requirements for independent financial

(b) ELEMENTS.—The strategy required by
subsection (a) to promote sustainable, inclu-
sive and broad-based economic development
shall include a plan with each of the fol-

sectors, including efforts to remove barriers
and increase competition, access, and oppor-

the Burmese military, former military offi-
cials, and their families, and businesspeople
connected to the military of Burma, with the
goal of eliminating the role of the military
in the economy of Burma.

closure requirements in key sectors of the
economy of Burma, to promote responsible
investment, including through—

develop and implement policy reforms re-
lated to public disclosure of the beneficial
owners of entities in key sectors identified
by the Government of Burma, specifically
by—

to require the disclosure of the ultimate ben-
eficial ownership of entities in the mining
industry and the publication of project reve-
nues, payments, and contract terms relating
to that industry; and

disclosures required to be put in place in
Burma as a result of its participation in the
Extractives Industry Transparency Initia-
tive; and

reliable, affordable, energy efficient, and sus-
tainable power, including leveraging United

power sector and electrification projects
that increase energy access, in partnership
with multilateral organizations and the pri-
vate sector.
(3) Measures to create an enabling environ-
ment for economic growth and opportunity
for all ethnic groups residing in Burma, in-
cluding through addressing issues related to
land tenure.
(4) An identification of needs and opportu-
nities to provide technical assistance to key
ministries, institutions, and organizations to
enact economic reforms, including revisions
to existing policies on public disclosure of
beneficial ownership of companies in key
sectors that will allow for identification of
those seeking or securing access to Burma’s
most valuable natural resources.

populations without meaningful consulta-
tion and consent, harm mitigation, and com-
pensation.
TITLE V—DETERMINATION OF
BUDGETARY EFFECTS
SEC. 501. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS.
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the
purpose of complying with the Statutory
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of
the Committee on the Budget of the House of
Representatives, provided that such state-
ment has been submitted prior to the vote on
passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each
will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Michigan.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include in the RECORD ex-
traneous materials on H.R. 3190.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Michigan?
There was no objection.
b 1530
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I would first like to
thank Chairman ENGEL and Mr.
CHABOT for authoring this legislation.
Since August 2017, we have seen some
of the most horrific ethnic violence in
the world at the hands of the Burmese
military in Burma’s Rakhine State.
The world has been shocked by the bru-
tality of war crimes and crimes against
humanity committed by Burmese mili-
tary and security forces.
Thousands of Rohingya civilians
have been killed. Many hundreds of
thousands more have been forced to
flee their homes and livelihoods. The
U.N. and independent investigators
have documented terrible sexual vio-
lence against women and girls.
Despite all this bloodshed, there has
been no meaningful accountability for
those responsible.
Let’s be clear: The military that car-
ried out genocide against the Rohingya
is the same military that has oppressed
and abused minority groups in Burma
for decades. It is the same military
that carries out abuse against Burmese
citizens to this day. This institution is
rotten to the core, and it is time for
change.
This bill would impose financial,
trade, and visa sanctions on those re-
sponsible for these crimes, including
the commander in chief and those who
have failed to investigate and pros-
ecute these abuses. It authorizes $220
million for humanitarian assistance to
affected communities, including com-
munities in Bangladesh. It pushes eco-
nomic reforms designed to get the mili-
tary out of the mining industry in
Burma.
This legislation passed the House be-
fore with an overwhelming vote of sup-
port. I urge my colleagues to join me
today in doing the same, once again.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.

Sincerely,
ELIOT L. ENGEL,
Chairman.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of Chairman ENGEL’s BURMA
Act of 2019. The Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee unanimously adopted this bill,
reflecting a bipartisan consensus that
the Burmese military’s atrocities
against the Rohingya people must not
go unanswered.
The committee has a decades-long
history of holding Burmese forces ac-
countable for their crimes. This is im-
portant, now more than ever after
their so-called clearance operations
against the Rohingya in August 2017.
The world watched in horror as Bur-
mese troops razed villages to the
ground, killed indiscriminately, com-
mitted unspeakable acts against
women and children, and laid land-
mines in the path of refugees as they
fled into neighboring Bangladesh.
Today, over 1 million Rohingya re-
main in Bangladesh, living in desperate
conditions, unable to return to their
home safely.
The scale and scope of this crisis
unites this whole House. Last Decem-
ber, this body adopted Congressman
CHABOT’s resolution, H. Res. 1091, de-
claring that the Burmese military is
guilty of genocide.
Chairman ENGEL’s BURMA Act of
2019 will selectively revive the sanc-
tions regime against the Burmese mili-
tary, which was recklessly scrapped
during the last administration. This
step is long overdue, and I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this
bipartisan effort.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank
Chairman ENGEL for introducing the
BURMA Act of 2019 in this Congress.
The Burmese military is responsible
for genocide, yet they continue to
wield constitutional power over Bur-
ma’s government and significant influ-
ence over Burma’s economy.
This bill is a long-overdue response
to that injustice and will reimpose
costs on the toxic influence of the Bur-
mese military.
Again, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing.
Mr. Speaker, it has been 2 years since
the massacres in Rakhine State, and
the suffering continues across the bor-
der in Bangladesh.
The House has passed this legislation
before with an overwhelming and bi-
partisan vote, sending a strong mes-
sage to perpetrators and victims alike.
I urge my colleagues to join me today
in doing the same once again.
This legislation is a necessary re-
sponse to one of the most pressing
human rights and humanitarian con-
cerns in the entire world today. I am
glad the House is considering it. I sa-
lute the gentleman from New York
(Mr. ENGEL), my chairman, and I en-
courage all Members to vote for its
passage.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
LEVIN) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3190, as
amended.
The question was taken.

ture for all of mankind;
Whereas the United States, Japan, and the
Republic of Korea are indispensable partners
in tackling global challenges and have

energy security, promote human rights, ad-
dress climate change, contribute to eco-
nomic development around the world, and
assist the victims of conflict and disaster

Whereas the United States and Japan es-
tablished diplomatic relations on March 31,
1854, with the signing of the Treaty of Peace

ples of the United States and the Republic of
Korea stretches back to Korea’s Chosun Dy-
nasty, when the United States and Korea es-
tablished diplomatic relations under the 1882
Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and
Navigation;
Whereas 2019 marks the 74th anniversary of
the end of World War II, a conflict in which
the United States and Japan were enemies,
and the strength of the United States-Japan
alliance is a testament to the ability of great
countries to overcome the past and to work
together to create a more secure and pros-
perous future;
Whereas the United States-Korea alliance
was forged in blood, with United States mili-

Whereas, the economic relationship be-
tween the United States and its sixth-largest
trading partner, the Republic of Korea, with
which we have a free trade agreement, in-
cludes 358,000 jobs in the United States that
are directly related to exports to the Repub-

Whereas Japan and the Republic of Korea
stand as strong partners of the United States
in efforts to ensure maritime security and

Whereas section 211 of the North Korea
Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of
2016 (22 U.S.C. 9231; Public Law 114–122) ex-

trilateral mechanisms for discussion and co-
ordination of policy toward North Korea be-

the Government of South Korea, and the
Government of Japan’’;
Whereas the Asia Reassurance Initiative
Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409) underscores

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res.
127.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Michigan?
There was no objection.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this
measure, and I want to start by thank-
ing Chairman ENGEL for his leadership
in bringing this measure forward today
and Mr. MCCAUL, Mr. SHERMAN, and
Mr. YOHO for their partnership in dem-
onstrating this is a bipartisan effort
aimed at strengthening the trilateral
ties among the United States, Japan,
and the Republic of Korea.
For many years now, our three coun-
tries have worked hard to lay the foun-
dation for enduring regional security
in Northeast Asia. We have found com-
mon ground in many areas: promoting
a rules-based economic order in Asia,
defending against aggression from
North Korea, and ensuring freedom of
navigation and overflight, to name a
few.
Recently, however, there has been an
alarming deterioration of relations be-
tween Seoul and Tokyo. Of particular
concern to U.S. interests has been the
decision to end the 2015 agreement, an
agreement the U.S. worked closely
with Seoul and Tokyo to reach, as well
as the politicization of bilateral trade
disputes. There is no question that we
need to get this relationship back on
track.
The United States, Japan, and Korea
have nothing to gain from the current
trajectory, but we all have a lot to
lose. American businesses lose out
when tense trade relations create un-
certainty about markets and supply
chains. American security is under-
mined when one of our greatest assets,
our alliances, are weakened. And, of
course, those who want to see the
rules-based order in Asia topple benefit
from all of this.
This resolution calls on the United
States, Japan, and the Republic of
Korea to strengthen our trilateral co-
operation in areas critical to all of us
and to safeguard and strengthen our
longstanding diplomatic, economic, se-
curity, and people-to-people ties.
This is a good measure that I am
pleased to support, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of this resolution, which Chairman
ENGEL and I introduced earlier this
year.
The U.S. alliances with Japan and
South Korea remain critical to U.S. na-
tional security interests in the Indo-
Pacific and around the world. The tri-
lateral cooperation we share with both
of these allies is essential now more
than ever, as we face China’s aggres-
sive expansion with its Belt and Road
policy and North Korea’s continued nu-
clear belligerence.
But the relationship between South
Korea and Japan continues to be bur-
dened by historical grievances sur-
rounding imperial Japan’s conduct
both before and during World War II.
These tensions have flared up since
late 2018, developing into an export
control dispute and, more recently, af-
fecting our security cooperation.
For instance, last month, South
Korea announced that it will withdraw
from the General Security of Military
Information Agreement with Japan.
This key intelligence-sharing pact is
essential to our joint responses to
North Korean missile launches and
other fast-developing military crises.
South Korea’s withdrawal will take ef-
fect in November, so it is essential that
this confrontation between the two im-
portant U.S. allies be resolved as soon
as possible.
Chairman ENGEL’s resolution is a
timely reminder of the U.S. relation-
ship with both of these critical secu-
rity partners and the enduring impor-
tance of our trilateral cooperation.
In addition, Mr. Speaker, Japan has
now banned certain products to be ex-
ported to South Korea that are used by
South Korea and Samsung, which is in
my district. They are the largest for-
eign investment in the United States.
Samsung will be hamstrung in its abil-
ity to create semiconductor chips and
bring them to the United States and its
facility out in Austin, Texas, in my
district.
For all these reasons, and national
security reasons, most importantly, I
urge my colleagues to support this
measure.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing.
Mr. Speaker, this resolution offers a
positive vision for our trilateral rela-
tionship. Its passage today reaffirms
the importance of our countries’ co-
operation on critical economic and se-
curity issues and calls on Seoul,
Tokyo, and Washington, collectively,
to develop a strategy to reverse the
current trajectory and to work to-
gether to build stronger ties.
It is a good resolution, and I urge my
colleagues to join me in supporting it.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
LEVIN) that the House suspend the
rules and agree to the resolution, H.
Res. 127, as amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Whereas June 20 is observed as World Ref-
ugee Day, a global day to acknowledge the
courage, strength, resilience, and determina-
tion of women, men, and children who are
forced to flee their homes due to conflict, vi-
olence, and persecution;
Whereas, in 2018, according to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees—
(1) there were more than 70,800,000 dis-
placed persons worldwide, the worst displace-
ment crisis in global history, including more
than 25,900,000 refugees, over 41,300,000 inter-
nally displaced persons, and 3,500,000 people
seeking asylum;
(2) on average, 37,000 people were forced
from their homes each day in the absence of
peace and reconciliation in countries where
armed conflict, violence, and persecution
continue to reign;
(3) 13,600,000 new individuals and families
were displaced, the majority of whom were
displaced within the borders of their own
countries;
(4) 60 percent of preventable maternal
deaths occur in situations of conflict and dis-
placement, and 1 in 5 refugees or displaced
women in situations of humanitarian crisis
suffer sexual violence, a figure which is like-
ly underestimated;
(5) children accounted for about half of all
refugees, only half of them attend school;
(6) refugee children were five times more
likely to be out of school than children who
are not displaced, with refugee girls having
less access to school than refugee boys;
(7) 67 percent of all refugees came from
Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar,
and Somalia, including 6,654,000 refugees
from Syria alone;
(8) there were more than 13,000,000 forcibly
displaced Syrians, including 6,654,000 refu-
gees, 6,184,000 internally displaced people,
and 140,000 asylum-seekers; and
(9) 84 percent of all refugees were hosted by
developing nations, and less than 1 percent
of vulnerable refugees in need of resettle-
ment had the opportunity to resettle because
sufficient numbers of places do not exist; and
Whereas the United States resettlement
program is a life-saving solution critical to
global humanitarian efforts, which serves to
strengthen global security, advance United
States foreign policy goals, and support re-
gional host countries while serving individ-
uals and families in need: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives—
(1) reaffirms the bipartisan commitment of
the United States to promote the safety,
health, education, and well-being of the mil-
lions of refugees and displaced persons up-
rooted by war, persecution, and violence in
search of peace, hope, and freedom;
(2) supports those who have risked their
lives, working either individually or for non-
governmental organizations or international
agencies such as the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, to provide life-
saving assistance and protection to those
displaced around the world;
(3) underscores the importance of the
United States refugee resettlement program
as a critical tool for United States global
leadership to leverage foreign policy,
strengthen national and regional security,
and encourage international solidarity with
host countries;
(4) calls upon the United States Secretary
of State and United States Ambassador to
the United Nations to—
(A) continue supporting robust funding for
refugee protection and humanitarian re-
sponse overseas and resettlement to the
United States;
(B) uphold the United States international
leadership role in responding to displace-
ment crises with humanitarian assistance,
and restore its leadership role in the protec-
tion of vulnerable refugee populations that
endure sexual violence, human trafficking,
persecution and violence against religious
minorities, forced conscription, genocide,
and exploitation;
(C) work in partnership with the inter-
national community to find solutions to ex-
isting conflicts, promote peace and reconcili-
ation, and prevent new conflicts from begin-
ning;
(D) continue supporting the efforts of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
gees and to advance the work of nongovern-
mental organizations to protect refugees re-
gardless of their country of origin or reli-
gious beliefs;
(E) continue to alleviate pressures on
frontline refugee host countries that absorb
the majority of the world’s refugees through
humanitarian and development support; and
(F) respond to the global refugee crisis by
meeting robust refugee admissions goals; and
(5) reaffirms the goals of World Refugee

There was no objection.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-

I want to start by thanking the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. TED LIEU)
and the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
DIAZ-BALART) for introducing this reso-
lution, which affirms the importance of
U.S. leadership to assist the unprece-
dented number of refugees and dis-
placed persons around the world.
Our country has a rich history of ac-
cepting refugees from all walks of life.
It is the cornerstone of what makes
America so special and why so many of
us are actually standing here today.
For decades, the United States ad-
mitted more refugees than any other
country. As a nation of immigrants,
Americans have always felt a special
obligation to take in people fleeing vio-
lence and danger.
But now, precisely when we are fac-
ing a worldwide refugee crisis, with the
numbers of displaced people at a record
high, the Trump administration has
drastically cut admissions. They are
rejecting our traditions of openness
and willingness to help people facing
great peril by slamming the door on
these innocent men, women, and chil-
dren.
There are 70.8 million people who are
displaced around the globe, and the
Trump administration has cut the
number we are allowing into our coun-
try to 30,000. It is a Band-Aid on a bul-
let wound, and it is a moral stain on
this country.
This resolution emphasizes the need
for the U.S. to lead on the global ref-
ugee crisis and calls on the Secretary
of State and the U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations to continue sup-
porting refugees and displaced persons.
It is a good measure that I urge my
colleagues to support.

worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees.
Sincerely,
JERROLD NADLER,
Chairman.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of this bipartisan resolution focusing
on refugees and displaced persons, and
I want to thank the gentleman from
California (Mr. TED LIEU) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZ-
BALART) for introducing the resolution.
Today, conflict, violence, and natural
disasters have displaced more than 70
million people around the world, the
highest levels in history. We see these
traumas in Syria, in Venezuela, in sub-
Saharan Africa, in Burma and many
other places.
These huge movements of vulnerable
people and populations are not just hu-
manitarian crises, but also strategic
challenges to the stability of many
critical regions.
The United States is and will con-
tinue to be a leader in confronting this
reality. We remain the largest single
donor supporting the needs of refugees
and displaced persons around the
world. But, as the need is increasing,
we must also push our partners and
other responsible nations to contribute
more to these important efforts.
This resolution also, appropriately,
recognizes the men and women who
risk their lives to provide lifesaving as-
sistance and protection to refugee pop-
ulations. Without their bravery and
dedication, none of this work would be
possible.
In closing, I want to urge all my col-
leagues to support this important reso-
lution.
Let me also say, on a point of per-
sonal privilege, I have enjoyed this ex-
change, this debate today with my
good friend from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN),
carrying on what I consider to be what
the Foreign Affairs Committee is most
proud of, and that is we are the most
bipartisan committee in the House and,
I would argue, in the Congress, and it
is a great tradition to carry forward. I
look forward to working with Mr.
LEVIN in the future.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing.
Mr. Speaker, 80 years ago, at the be-
ginning of World War II, a ship called
the St. Louis neared America’s shores.
937 passengers, almost all Jewish refu-
gees of the Nazis, asked for the United
States to allow them entry.
We easily could have absorbed all
these people and more, but instead we
turned them away. Many were taken in
by Western European countries, but
254, more than a quarter of them, died
in the Holocaust. We could have pre-
vented these deaths, but we didn’t.
So as we consider this resolution,
let’s remember the lessons of the St.
Louis. I remain committed to undoing
the devastation done to America’s tra-
dition of admitting refugees. Our coun-
try’s ceiling for refugee admissions is
already at a historic low. We must do
more to provide safe haven for the 70.8
million innocent people who are dis-
placed all around this world.
This administration’s crackdown on
refugees is irresponsible. It leaves a
moral stain on our Nation and will con-
tribute to national security threats
stemming from global instability.
I urge my colleagues to support the
good, bipartisan measure offered by
Mr. LIEU and Mr. DIAZ-BALART.
I echo my colleague from Texas Mr.
MCCAUL’s remarks. It is a deep honor
to be here debating this measure with
Mr. MCCAUL, and I look forward to
working with him in a bipartisan man-
ner that is really a unique and a proud
tradition of the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE
CONSIDERED AS FIRST SPONSOR
OF H.R. 464
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that I may
hereafter be considered as the first
sponsor of H.R. 464, a bill originally in-
troduced by Representative Walter
Jones of North Carolina, for the pur-
poses of adding cosponsors and request-
ing reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of
rule XII.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Ohio?
There was no objection.
HONORING DR. EMILY CLYBURN
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I would
like to take a moment to honor Dr.
Emily England Clyburn, the wife of
Majority Whip JAMES E. CLYBURN,
after her passing on September 19.
It is often said that behind every
great man is an even greater woman.
Certainly, this was true of Dr. Clyburn.
She was a great woman who supported
a great man.
Known affectionately as Miss Emily
or Dr. Em, Dr. Clyburn was a kind,
compassionate, and incredibly gen-
erous woman.
She spent most of her career as a li-
brarian, first in public schools and then
for almost 30 years at the Charleston
Naval Base and Dorn VA Medical Cen-
ter in Columbia, South Carolina. Her
love of learning led her to raise mil-
lions of dollars to create more need-
based scholarships for her alma mater,
South Carolina State University.
Mrs. Clyburn knew the importance of
a good education, and she wanted to
create more opportunities for students
of color throughout the State. It was
part of her strong commitment to
equality.
We will remember her as a dedicated
fighter for civil rights. She was a
model of class and character through-
out her life.
My thoughts and prayers are with
Mr. CLYBURN; his daughters, Mignon,
Jennifer, and Angela; the family; and
all the people of South Carolina during
this time of loss.

WELCOMING PRIME MINISTER
MODI
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, on Sunday, I was
grateful for the opportunity to partici-
pate in the ‘‘Howdy, Modi’’ welcome
celebration for Prime Minister
Narendra Modi of India in Houston at-
tended by over 50,000 Indian Americans.
With President Donald Trump at-
tending, this event was historic for
being the largest such welcome for a
world leader in the history in the
United States. It was an extraordinary
day to appreciate India as the world’s
largest democracy, with America being
the world’s oldest democracy.
The Prime Minister praised President
Trump as a true friend in the White
House, describing the President as
‘‘warm, friendly, accessible, energetic,
and full of wit.’’ Mr. Trump praised Mr.
Modi for doing a truly exceptional job
for India. He also paid tribute to the
Indian American community for its dy-
namic contributions with success in
America.
I appreciate being invited by Presi-
dent KV Kumar of the Indian American
International Chamber of Commerce
and being hosted by Ambassador Harsh
Shringla and Consul General Swati
Kulkarni.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism
with the leadership of President Don-
ald Trump.

INSPIRE TODAY’S INNOVATORS
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker,
last week, I was proud to support the
Christa McAuliffe Commemorative
Coin Act. There is no better way to
honor an educator, explorer, and trail-
blazer like Ms. McAuliffe than to edu-
cate the next generation of learners.
The explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger was a heartbreaking trag-
edy, but Ms. McAuliffe gave her life in
pursuit of discovering the next fron-
tier. She was not afraid of dreaming
big. She boldly went out to test our
knowledge of what is possible and
pushed humanity forward.
The commemorative coins created
through this act will inspire and sup-
port the same passion in the young
people who participate in the FIRST
Robotics Program today.
Founded by Dean Kamen—the inven-
tor of my chair, the iBot—FIRST uses
science, technology, engineering, art,
and math, or STEAM, to get young
people excited about learning and inno-
vating.
In Ms. McAuliffe’s memory, FIRST
competitions are inspiring the next
generation of scientists, explorers, and
leaders who we will need to solve the
problems of today and tomorrow.

RECOGNIZING HARRY W.
SWEEZEY, JR.
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chief
Warrant Officer Harry W. Sweezey, Jr.,
as we celebrate his 80th birthday on
September 27.
Mr. Sweezey is a true American hero
who served for more than 20 years in
the United States Navy and Coast
Guard, earning numerous awards for
his valiant service.
Born in Malden, Massachusetts, in
1939, Mr. Sweezey’s father served in the
Navy during World War II but passed
away in an aircraft accident after the
war. Nevertheless, Mr. Sweezey’s pas-
sion for serving our Nation persisted,
and he enlisted in the U.S. Navy upon
graduation from high school.
After transferring to serve in the
U.S. Army, he fulfilled his lifelong
dream of becoming a helicopter pilot,
serving all over the world, including in
the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the

Czech Republic-Germany border, and in

Rising to the rank of chief warrant
officer, Mr. Sweezey retired from the
Army in 1991 and was awarded the Le-
gion of Merit.
Mr. Sweezey continues to serve, hav-
ing joined the U.S. Coast Guard Auxil-
iary in his retirement community of
Panama City, Florida, rising to the
rank of flotilla commander.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr.
Sweezey for his service to our country.
He is an inspiration to us all.
f
RECOGNIZE CONSTITUTIONAL
DUTY
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I was speaking to one of our colleagues
who indicated that he held a town hall
meeting where he was explaining, as a
civics matter, the Constitution of the
United States and the role of the
United States Congress in holding the
executive accountable. He said his con-
stituents relished the opportunity to
understand the process.
I am going to remind our colleagues
that any time we move toward a proc-
ess that is constitutionally based, it is
somber and respectful, detailed and ef-
ficient.
So I want to read from Article I, Sec-
tion 2, Clause 5, which indicates that
the House of Representatives ‘‘shall
have the sole power of impeachment.’’
Article II states that the President
‘‘shall be removed from office on im-
peachment for, and conviction of, trea-
son, bribery, or other high crimes and
misdemeanors.’’ Article II also requires
that the President ‘‘take care that the
laws be faithfully executed.’’
With that in mind, I believe it is im-
portant that this Congress recognizes
its duty to work in an efficient man-
ner; that all committees work and in-
vestigate, and all committees do their
work in a somber manner; and that we
continue to educate our constituents
about the value of the Constitution,
the beauty of this Nation, and the rule
of law. That would mean that we are
doing our job as Members of the United
States Congress.
The Constitution governs the order of our
nation and it dictates the work of the Con-
gress. Article I details the powers of the
House and the exercising of these powers as
they relate to the coordinate, coequal
branches of government, codified in Articles II
and Articles III: three equal branches of gov-
ernment coexisting and cohesively working to
provide oversight to the respective actions of
the Congress, the Executive and Judiciary.
This has worked, with challenges of course,
since 1789, and the situation which we are
now currently facing is directed by three provi-
sions of the Constitution.
Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 indicates that
the ‘‘House of Representatives . . . shall
have the sole power of impeachment.’’ Arti-
cle II states that the ‘‘The President . . .
shall be removed from Office on Impeach-
ment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Brib-
ery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors.; Article II also requires that the
‘‘President take care that the laws are faith-
fully executed.’’
That language is stark and clear—and
throughout our history it has been used in
varying periods where the assessment was
that the law has been breached. Sometimes
Congresses are concerned that the weight
and view of the American people should be
considered. Sometimes they are moved by the
urgency of the matter. We now have an urgent
matter: that matter involves the President of
the United States speaking to a sovereign for-
eign nation and conspicuously and overtly
asking for an investigation of his opponent in
a presidential election, forthcoming in 2020. In
addition to this request for an overt investiga-
tion of an American citizen, within close prox-
imity to this, the president directed a staff
member to deny the directives of the United
States Congress to provide foreign aid to this
sovereign nation—Ukraine—an act that is
without comparison in our knowledge in the
history of the United States, and an act that
falls within the language of the law of the Con-
stitution, abuse of power and certainly one
that violates Article II’s dictate that the Presi-
dent ensure that the laws are faithfully exe-
cuted.
Let us be very clear: monies were stalled,
denied and delayed to a sovereign nation in
the backdrop of a directive of Congress to
issue funds to a sovereign nation as leverage
in order to investigate a private citizen of the
United States. Further, the series of acts of
obstruction involving Congress has been bold
and continuous. The House Judiciary Com-
mittee effectively has brought forth witnesses,
and sought witnesses that were then directed
by the President to not appear, in violation of
the three equal branches of government. In
spite of that, the committee has meticulously
continued its work in building a case for im-
peachment.
Last week, we prepared extensively for the
testimony of Corey Lewandowsky, who is not
and has never been a federal employee, was
not employed by the White House at any time,
and not employed by the federal government
at any time and also who was directed by the
President to rebuff, stall and thwart; and who
also was, in essence, directed to stain the
constitutional process, by his responses, and
the authority of the Congress.
Article I gives the Congress, and the House
of Representatives in particular, its authority to
proceed to hold the President of the United
States accountable. There is no room for any
other process. There is no other action. There
is no other time. With a heavy heart, it is im-
perative that the impeachment inquiry begin
and that the Articles of Impeachment are filed
expeditiously; and that the Constitution works
with the full authority of the United States
Congress. That the Article I works with Article
III courts to ensure an orderly response and
respectful approach to this somber, sacred
and high calling of the Congress and the Na-
tion.

RECOGNIZING JOHN WOOD’S
LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, it is very fitting that John
Wood receive a lifetime achievement
award from the Career Colleges &
Schools of Texas.
He and his wife, Victoria, have
worked tirelessly to make the Ocean
Corporation a place where students
gain the skills they need to lead suc-
cessful and productive lives in a vari-
ety of occupations that benefit not
only the student but also the State of
Texas and, indeed, the country and the
world.
Their focus is always on ensuring
that the programs are of the highest
quality and that students are career-
ready when they leave their various
programs.
Having visited the Ocean Corporation
myself, I can testify to the dedication
of the faculty and staff that John and
Victoria have assembled. In addition to
their dedication to high-quality pro-
grams, they have maintained their en-
thusiasm for the value of career edu-
cation and the choices that it presents.
John is deserving of the award, and I
commend all who are responsible for
recognizing him and his true lifetime
achievement.
f
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST
COMPLY
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today as co-chair of the Congressional
Ukraine Caucus. Like so many Ameri-
cans, I am alarmed by President
Trump’s repeated betrayal of American
national security interests in favor of
Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.
This President, President Trump, has
put efforts forward to coerce Ukraine’s
new President Zelensky, an allied lead-
er, into helping Trump win reelection
by using congressionally supported
military aid as leverage.
That is not only a dramatic betrayal
of the President’s oath of office; it is
also the latest example of Trump doing
Putin’s bidding.
I am certain this President’s rela-
tionship with Vladimir Putin didn’t
start with his veiled support for
Putin’s election meddling, inviting the
Russians to hack the DNC, or even lob-
bying for inviting Russia to be re-
admitted to the G7, for heaven’s sake.
So, who benefits when Ukraine loses
military assistance and Zelensky is hu-
miliated? Russia: the country that has
waged a bloody war in Ukraine for over
5 years, leaving over 13,000 dead, 30,000
injured, and over 1.5 million people dis-
placed.
Who is to say Putin wasn’t listening
in when Trump blackmailed Zelensky?

CONGRATULATING BAYLOR, SCOTT
& WHITE THE HEART HOSPITAL
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today
I rise to congratulate Baylor, Scott &
White The Heart Hospital for being
named Physician Hospital of the Year
by Physician Hospitals of America.
Located in my hometown of Plano,
Texas, The Heart Hospital ranks as one
of the top-performing cardiac surgical
programs in the entire country and
provides Collin County with the high-
est level of cardiac healthcare.
Since opening in 2007, The Heart Hos-
pital has worked day in and day out to
save lives and ensure compassion to ev-
eryone who enters there.
Our community is proud to be the
home of this state-of-the-art facility
and its many astounding healthcare
providers and staff.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to join me in congratulating The Heart
Hospital of Plano on their recent suc-
cess and thanking them for all their
hard work.
f
VETERANS’ ISSUES
(Mr. COX of California asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. COX of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to speak on two
significant issues that affect the brave
individuals who have fought for our
Nation.
First, almost a quarter of all vet-
erans in the United States—approxi-
mately 4.7 million—reside in rural
communities. While veterans may
enjoy the benefits of rural living, they
also experience unique challenges in
accessing the healthcare they need and
deserve.
Currently, through reauthorization,
the Department of Veterans Affairs
grant program for the transportation
of highly rural veterans appropriates $3
million for the Department to provide
transportation in rural areas. This pro-
gram should not need annual reauthor-
ization; it should be made permanent.
Second, the Veterans Benefits Ad-
ministration has moved to electroni-
cally process over 99 percent of com-
pensation claims since the implemen-
tation of the Veterans Benefits Man-
agement System. This transition has
been key in reducing the backlog of
claims, modernizing the Federal Gov-
ernment, and improving efficiency.
I propose amending title 38 of the
United States Code to assist the VA as
they modernize and utilize today’s
technological advancements in order to
best serve our veterans.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in working on legis-
lation that will fix these oversights
and to further support every person
who serves our Nation.
f
THANKING YORK COUNTY
ECONOMIC ALLIANCE
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to thank the York County
Economic Alliance for their work to
promote opportunity zones in York
County.
Madam Speaker, we know that the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is work-
ing for the American people, allowing
families to keep more of their hard-
earned dollars in their paychecks.
Businesses are expanding and cre-
ating jobs across York and Lancaster
Counties, creating an economy with
more opportunity for everyone.
One of the strongest tools created by
the TCJA is opportunity zones, a way
to spur development and job creation
in economically distressed commu-
nities.
In fact, I look forward to hosting the
Small Business Administration for an
opportunity zone roundtable in the
near future to share with our commu-
nity the potential advantages of in-
vestments in their neighborhoods.
The YCEA, led by President and CEO
Kevin Schreiber and Silas Chamberlin,
the Vice President of Economic and
Community Development, has done an
incredible job through its website,
‘‘opportunityyork.org,’’ sharing how
opportunity zones can positively trans-
form our communities. This is a great
example of a local chamber helping
businesses build and invest for the ben-
efit of our shared community.
Madam Speaker, York County is
open for business with the help of the
YCEA. I thank them for being a reli-
able and hardworking partner for York
County’s economic growth and pros-
perity.

CONGRATULATING BARBARA KIM-
HAGEMANN, NEW JERSEY VFW
STATE COMMANDER
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, on
June 22, Barbara Kim-Hagemann be-
came the first woman—the very first
woman—to be installed as State com-
mander for New Jersey’s Veterans of
Foreign Wars.
Barbara is a U.S. Army veteran who
served in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait dur-
ing Desert Shield and during Desert
Storm.
When she returned to America, she
joined a VFW, and the VFW post was in
Jackson, New Jersey. There, she be-
came the first female post commander
in Ocean County and then the first fe-
male district commander, where she
served for two terms.
Now, as VFW State commander, Bar-
bara’s project for this year focuses on
veteran suicide prevention and mental
health awareness, a subject that is so
important and needs so much work.
She also works on strengthening net-
works of support, communication, and
care for veterans across New Jersey’s
communities.
We are incredibly lucky to have Bar-
bara. I thank her for her service abroad
and the continued service she brings to
our south Jersey community. Her
State is proud of her, south Jersey is
proud of her, and the United States of
America is proud of her.
May God bless Barbara Kim-Hage-
mann.

National Suicide Prevention Month.
This is not an easy subject to talk
about, especially since each person’s
circumstances differ. Yet, as the num-
ber 10 cause of death in the U.S., it is
vital that people understand the issues
concerning suicide and mental health
so that anyone can help a person in cri-
sis.
That is the focus of the advocacy
message surrounding National Suicide
Prevention Month this year, which is
‘‘Be the one to.’’ Be the one to, because
we can all follow the five action steps
to make an impact on someone’s life:
Be the one to ask.
Be the one to keep them safe.
Be the one to be there.
Be the one to help them connect.
Be the one to follow up.
The National Suicide Prevention
Lifeline website also provides tips to
better identify potential warning signs
before applying these five steps, as well
as other resources.
For those in crisis, know that you
are not alone and help is available. The
lifeline is run 24/7 and can be reached
at 1–800–273–8255.
f
SUICIDE TRENDS
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I, too,
rise on the issue of suicide.
Every day in America, 129 people die
by suicide. Over a single year, that is
more than 47,000 souls, each an irre-
placeable loss.
Even more troubling, suicide is on
the rise among teens, vets, and law en-
forcement. Between 2001 and 2017, the
suicide rate increased by 31 percent.
That year, 2017, saw 1.4 million suicide
attempts in this country.
These trends have many causes, and
we must get to the bottom of them, but
we can start saving lives today.
Congress recently passed the STOIC
Act, and the President signed it into
law. This bipartisan bill will fund sui-
cide prevention programs for law en-
forcement, where deaths by suicide
now outstrip line-of-duty deaths.
Gun safety legislation will also make
a difference. Firearms kill 40,000 people
each year, including 60 percent to sui-
cide.
Background checks and red flag laws
save lives, but the Senate and the
President have refused to act. We must
call out their absence of action. Our
country needs them to stand up.
Our own colleague, Representative
SUSAN WILD, recently lost her partner
to suicide and has bravely described its
devastating effects and now lifts her
strong voice so that others will not suf-
fer the same.
Madam Speaker, it is time for us to
act.
f
CONTINUING PRAYERS FOR
DEPUTY BRAD SULLIVAN
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, on Sep-
tember 5, 2019, the Madison County
Sheriff’s Department responded to a
hostage situation near Canton, Mis-
sissippi.
Upon arrival, the suspect fled and led
deputies on a high-speed chase
throughout the northeastern part of
the county before spike strips were de-
ployed to stop the suspect’s vehicle.
Once immobilized, the suspect began to
fire on deputies, striking two officers.
Deputy Brad Sullivan was shot mul-
tiple times as he arrived on the scene
and was later transported to the Uni-
versity of Mississippi Medical Center.
Deputy Sullivan remains in serious
condition as our community unites
with prayer, donations, and medical
skill to save the life of this brave offi-
cer.
On behalf of Mississippi’s Third Con-
gressional District, I would like to ex-
tend my sincerest gratitude and re-
spect for Deputy Sullivan, the other
deputies who responded, and the entire
Madison County Sheriff’s Department.
We ask all Mississippians to continue
to pray for Brad’s recovery and for
God’s hand of protection on all our law
enforcement officers.

FIRE DANGER MITIGATION
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
rise tonight to commend Vicki
Christiansen, the Forest Service Chief,
for proposing a new rule to add to our
fire danger mitigation that we need to
do in California and across the West.
Building upon my bill from a year
and a half ago, the Electricity Reli-
ability and Forest Protection Act, this
allows the streamlining of the process
to clear trees and brush, et cetera,
around power lines, that make it a fire
hazard.
We have certainly suffered enough
fire loss in California. I had the Camp
fire right in my own district, the Carr
fire last year as well and, this year, al-
ready 54,000 acres burned in Plumas
County.
As it is right now, our utilities have
a hard time being able to get out and
do the work because the permit process
can be difficult. So they resort to late-
ly, right in the middle of my district,
what is known as the public safety
power shutoff as a precaution, with the
wind conditions and heat perhaps being
able to cause additional wildfire.
We shouldn’t put the utilities in that
position of being cursed if they do or
cursed if they don’t for a possible fire.
We need to get the work done around
the power lines. So I hope this rule put
through by the U.S. Forest Service will
help us accomplish that.
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from the
Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of
the majority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and include
any extraneous material on the subject
of this Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the Virgin Islands?
There was no objection.
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I
rise as a member of the Congressional
Black Caucus to speak to this body
about the issues that are important to
Americans, everyday Americans.
The Congressional Black Caucus is
the conscience of the Congress, and we
feel that it is our responsibility in our
Special Order Hours to address those
issues and concerns that are of most
importance to the people of America.
We represent 70 million Americans in
our caucus, 55 Members strong, and we
are using this time to address this Con-
gress on the issues of agriculture and
the Black community.
Agriculture and the Black commu-
nity, it is more than just SNAP for us.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
DAVID SCOTT).
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I come before you as
the chairman of the Agriculture Sub-
committee on Commodity Exchanges,
Energy, and Credit.
Madam Speaker, I rise at this mo-
ment to speak out against the United
States Department of Agriculture’s
food and nutrition service proposed
rule to change the eligibility require-
ments for SNAP; and let me tell you
why, Madam Speaker.
It is because this proposed rule, num-
ber one, it would eliminate broad-based
categorical eligibility for SNAP, and
effectively end all SNAP benefits for
more than 3 million seniors, veterans,
working families with children, and in-
dividuals with disabilities.
Current eligibility simply allows low-
income families and children to receive
SNAP benefits if they have already
qualified for other anti-poverty pro-
grams. That’s it.
But, Madam Speaker, in fiscal year
2016 alone, over 10,000 Georgia house-
holds were helped to meet their basic
needs as a direct result of current eligi-
bility.
This proposed change is founded upon
an unfortunately common, but incor-
rect assumption of ‘‘bad actors’’ wast-
ing government funds. Nothing could
be further from the truth. It is not
about that.
In reality, these programs have prov-
en to both encourage work and in-
crease savings in order to transition
out of the program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7893
September 24, 2019
Madam Speaker, millions of Ameri-
cans are just one lost job, just one
health crisis, or another emergency,
maybe the bread winner passed on.
These things happen unexpectedly and
any other emergency issues that may
arise, it keeps them from becoming
food insecure.
Madam Speaker, there are a lot of
things that we can do without, but food
we cannot ever do without. So it is up
to us Members of Congress to look out
for the most vulnerable among us.
If implemented, this rule would not
only remove food from the tables of
Americans, but also reduce their poten-
tial for economic success and financial
security.
Ultimately, eliminating the ability
of States to use categorical eligibility
would mean jeopardizing the very fu-
tures of many hardworking Americans.
So I urge my colleagues to join us
within the Black Caucus—it is about
all of us—and speak out against this
proposed change in order to protect the
health and well-being of all of our
American people.
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for that enlight-
ening information that he has shared
with us. We know that the years of ex-
perience and seniority that the gen-
tleman has gained on the Agriculture
Committee have given him not only a
passion, but a real understanding of
the issues that are important, not only
to Americans who utilize SNAP, but to
those farmers and those in our agricul-
tural community who are supportive of
the things that we are trying to push
forward and that this administration
is, in fact, trying to impede.
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, that is correct. And
that is why we are here tonight, with
great compassion, with great fairness,
asking our Members of Congress, on a
unanimous basis, to join in this fight.
It is not just our fight. This is a fight
that appeals to the basic nature and
purpose of the American people. That
is us. And I appreciate the gentle-
woman inviting me to share in making
this appeal.
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I
think of all the money that America
spends on foreign aid, foreign food pro-
grams; and the fact that we, as Ameri-
cans, are squabbling over feeding our
own, of providing nutrition and assist-
ance to those families, to veterans, to
our elders, to our children who need
these programs, it is astounding that
we even have to have this conversa-
tion.
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman is
right. And I leave you with the words,
the eloquent words, of Thomas Jeffer-
son when he gave us the meaning of
our great Nation: ‘‘Life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.’’
One thing is for certain, we can’t be
happy without food because we can’t
live without food. There is no greater
meaning for the implementation of
Thomas Jefferson’s words: ‘‘Life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness.’’
That means food.
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, as
you can see, I am here alongside my
colleagues of the Congressional Black
Caucus in strong opposition to the ad-
ministration’s proposal to severely re-
strict broad-based categorical eligi-
bility, or cat-el.
This rule would kick millions of peo-
ple struggling with hunger from the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program, most commonly known as
SNAP, as well as approximately 250,000
children from preschool meals; 250,000
children who rely on this program to
provide them with lunch, with break-
fast, allowing them to be able to utilize
their skills in school, allowing them to
be able to learn on a daily basis.
Many of these children, we know,
without this program are unable to
eat, are unable to be able to stay
awake in school because of the hunger
that is within them, right here in this
country. And so we are fighting to
make sure that those children are not
removed; that those millions of Ameri-
cans are not removed from this pro-
gram.
SNAP provides nutrition benefits to
supplement the food budget of needy
families so they can purchase healthy
food and move toward self-sufficiency;
providing food assistance that averages
just $1.40 per person per meal, $1.40 per
meal.
SNAP is a modest benefit, with near-
ly half of the participants running out
of benefits before the end of the month.
If anything, policymakers should be de-
bating how much to increase this sup-
plemental benefit, given that there is
no room for cuts.
What’s more, Trump’s tax law gave
more in tax breaks to the top 1 percent
than SNAP costs in its entirety. And if
the Trump administration is looking
for strategies to achieve savings in
SNAP, while actually helping workers,
it need look no further than raising the
Federal minimum wage. Raising the
Federal minimum wage to $12, not even
the $15 proposed in the Raise the Wage
Act, would save $53 billion over the
next 10 years, nearly four times as
much as the proposed rule, by ensuring
that workers earn more so that they
are better able to afford food, instead
of punishing labor market struggles
with hunger.
The Trump administration’s pro-
posed rule would recalculate how we
measure poverty, a move that would
more than likely result in reducing the
eligibility criteria for individuals and
removing people off certain Federal
programs that are meant to assist poor
and low-income families.
Recently, the Trump administration
proposed a rule that would recalculate
how we measure poverty, a move that
would more than likely result in reduc-
ing the eligibility criteria for individ-
uals and removing people off certain
Federal programs that are meant to as-
sist poor and low-income families.
The proposed rule would change how
the Census measures poverty in a man-
ner that will artificially drive down the
number of people counted as officially
poor. Because eligibility for a range of
basic supports is calculated based on
the poverty threshold, each year, as
costs go up, many working people with
low pay would gradually be stripped of
SNAP, WIC, Medicaid, parts of Medi-
care, Head Start, school lunch, legal
services, even tax credits under the Af-
fordable Care Act.
In my own district, due to Hurricanes
Irma and Maria, the Virgin Islands De-
partment of Human Services Division
of Family Assistance executed Disaster
SNAP, D-SNAP, and regular SNAP si-
multaneously. The Virgin Islands pro-
vided this Disaster SNAP to approxi-
mately 30,000 households, and SNAP to
approximately 29,000 households.
There are approximately now 22,000
people on SNAP in the Virgin Islands,
where we have a 33 percent child pov-
erty rate.
As a member of the House Agri-
culture Committee, and a conferee on
the 2018 farm bill, I am proud of the
work we did on that bill. This proposal
flies in the face of everything we
worked on to build a bipartisan bill, a
bipartisan consensus around the proc-
ess of SNAP, and the funding, and the
support we recognize that American
families need.
House Democrats and our colleagues
in the Senate expressly rejected
changes to cat-el; the end result was
the most overwhelmingly bipartisan
farm bill in history. This is only an at-
tempt by an ideological White House at
an end-run around congressional in-
tent. The White House is trying to take
away the authority of this body, and
we will not stand by and allow that to
happen.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE),
who has worked extensively on this
issue, as well as poverty issues and
issues on how to increase healthcare
benefits to American families. I yield
to the gentleman to speak about those
issues.
b 1945
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from the U.S.
Virgin Islands for yielding and for her
continued leadership on issues that im-
pact Americans throughout the dias-
pora and also issues that the CBC finds
necessary to continue to raise. We are
known as the conscience of the Con-
gress, and although we are the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, we represent
78 million Americans of all stripes.
That is something that I think is very
important for people to understand.
I am not surprised that the gentle-
woman once again has raised an issue
for the caucus that impacts so many
people in this Nation and, if President
Trump has his way, negatively impacts
so many people in this Nation.
I am very concerned about Trump’s
latest attack on low-income Ameri-
cans. His administration would like to
make drastic changes to the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program,

or SNAP. The program, which used to
be called food stamps, has helped mil-
lions of working parents, disabled
Americans, and seniors afford a more
nutritional diet.
Traditionally, SNAP benefits were
assigned based on a standard income
level. If you made less than 130 percent
of the Federal poverty level, roughly
$2,300 per month, you were eligible. If
you made more than that, you were
not. However, there was an important
clause in how the State governments
assessed that income.
If you had a more prosperous year,
say you made an extra $100 or $200 per
month thanks to a side job, you could
still be eligible for the benefits. States
knew that such income might be tem-
porary, and they did not want to pun-
ish hardworking Americans for seeking
a better life.
The system worked because it en-
couraged nutritious eating for lower
income citizens, a group that studies
show have less nutritious diets across
the board. And it allowed them to save
a little money for the future.
In addition, it saved time because it
allowed recipients to enroll automati-
cally and provided a new market for
American farm products. It was a win-
win for everyone involved.
So, naturally, Trump wants to
change that. He wants to impose a hard
cap on the income levels for recipients,
and he wants to eliminate eligibility
for people with more than $2,300 in a
bank account.
If the rule is enacted, it could be dis-
astrous for our country’s lower income
workers, disabled citizens, and the el-
derly. Millions of them could lose their
benefits and return to unhealthy eat-
ing, because that is all they would be
able to afford.
Study after study shows the costs to
our Nation’s healthcare from patients
with poor diets. The Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention estimates
that unhealthy eating costs about $1
trillion, with a T, per year in extra
healthcare and contributes to the
death of almost 700,000 citizens annu-
ally, the size of a congressional dis-
trict. These are costs we do not need,
especially at a time when many econo-
mists say a recession is looming.
There are several other problems
with this proposed rule. It promotes
the belief that lower income Americans
should stay lower income because it
punishes people who want to save a lit-
tle money. If you save too much, you
could lose your benefits.
The greatest harm would be done to
innocent schoolchildren. The free
school meal programs across the coun-
try use SNAP eligibility to determine
whether children can qualify for the
meals. If their parents get eliminated
from the system, at least 265,000 stu-
dents could go hungry during the
school day. If they lose those meals,
academic studies show that their per-
formance in school will drop signifi-
cantly. You cannot think about math
when you are thinking about an empty
stomach. They will have lower stand-
ardized test scores, and they are more
likely to come to school late, if they
come at all.
These children feel the shame of
being in the Free and Reduced Meal
Program already. This rule would re-
duce that shame by making sure they
do not have any meals at all.
These are students who need support
the most, so we need to support them
the most. What we do not need are
rules designed to keep them in poverty
from an administration dedicated to
enriching the wealthy and themselves.
We need to give States the freedom
to assess their SNAP eligibility in a
way that empowers them to empower
their citizens. We need to promote
healthy living with proper diet and nu-
trition choices. We need to protect our
schoolchildren and do everything pos-
sible to make sure that they get every
educational benefit possible.
That is why we need to fight this pro-
posed rule change to the SNAP pro-
gram.
Our farmers are struggling, thanks to
Trump’s trade wars, and our students
are struggling from inequality already.
We do not need to make both of those
problems worse.
We are mortified but not surprised by
the actions of a callous administration
toward people of need. It is not sur-
prising that the administration has
looked into how it could once again pe-
nalize poor people, struggling children,
and the elderly, who have paid their
dues, played by the rules, and now need
a little assistance, but they just don’t
matter.
This is not the country I was led to
believe that I was growing up in. This
is not what I learned in school. What
we see here is a disassembling of a na-
tion. Everything that we have stood for
is falling apart around us because of
this President and his administration.
We will continue to fight. I think our
Nation is stronger than one man. We
will come together as a great Nation
once again and take care of the least of
us. It is our obligation.
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for the great in-
formation, the statistics, the science
that is there that explains to us what
happens when SNAP is denied to young
people, as well as his heartfelt words
about where our Nation is going when
we are unable to feed our own.
I have some remarks from another
Member of the Congressional Black
Caucus, Congresswoman MARCIA
FUDGE, who is the chairperson of the
Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight,
and Department Operations of the Ag-
riculture Committee.
Madam Speaker, over 40 States and
territories use broad-based categorical
eligibility, or BBCE, to streamline the
administration of SNAP and provide
critical assistance to households re-
ceiving benefits and services through
the Temporary Assistance to Needy
Families block grant.
BBCE is proven to help millions of
working poor families move toward fi-
nancial security by easing the benefits
cliff as their earnings increase.
On July 24, 2019, USDA published a
proposed rule to restrict the use of
BBCE and eliminate SNAP benefits for
an estimated 3.1 million Americans.
This includes children, working fami-
lies, military veterans, disabled indi-
viduals, and our seniors.
Most shameful is the proposal’s im-
pact on hungry school-age children. By
USDA’s own estimates, the new policy
would take away direct access to free
school meals for at least 500,000 school-
children. Nearly half a million children
would be left to go hungry during the
school day, shifting the burden to
strapped school districts.
In her State of Ohio, according to the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, over
61,000 SNAP households would lose
their benefits. USDA reports that, in
2017, the prevalence of food insecurity
among those in Ohio was higher than
the national average. 13.7 percent of
Ohioans were food insecure in 2017 com-
pared to 12.3 percent nationally.
Even USDA admits the proposed
changes to SNAP would make food in-
security worse and make it hard for
millions of Americans to get by. Most
notably, it would remove the current
flexibility for States and territories to
use BBCE to tailor SNAP to best meet
the food needs of their own popu-
lations.
Republicans love to talk about
States’ rights when it suits them, but
when it comes to the flexibility of
States to meet the needs of food-inse-
cure populations, then they want some-
thing very different.
As the economy continues to leave
working families and our most vulner-
able behind, programs like SNAP are
needed more than ever.
Congress already debated these
issues. We came together and rejected
this policy in both the 2014 and 2018
farm bills with a record bipartisan
vote.
This proposed rule is shameful, cruel,
and contrary to the will of Congress.
This unilateral action by the adminis-
tration only complicates legitimate bi-
partisan efforts to make programs like
SNAP more effective and efficient for
millions of people who rely on it to put
food on the table.
I thank Congresswoman FUDGE for
her remarks, and she will include the
remainder of her remarks in the
RECORD.
I would note that on May 22, 2019, I
sent my own Governor of the Virgin Is-
lands a letter reminding him of the
need for us to speak out on the pro-
posed rule that would recalculate how
we measure poverty, a move that
would make it more than likely to re-
sult in reducing the eligibility criteria
for individuals and removing people off
certain Federal programs that are
meant to assist poor and low-income
families. I include that letter in the
RECORD.

September 24, 2019
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Washington, DC, May 22, 2019.
Governor ALBERT BRYAN Jr.,
Christiansted, VI.
GOVERNOR BRYAN: Recently, the Trump
Administration proposed a rule that would
recalculate how we measure poverty, a move
that would more than likely result in reduc-
ing the eligibility criteria for individuals
and removing people off certain federal pro-
grams that are meant to assist poor and low-
income families.
The proposed rule would change how the
Census measures poverty in a manner that
that will artificially drive down the number
of people counted as officially poor. Because
eligibility for a range of basic supports is
calculated based on the poverty threshold,
each year as costs go up, many working peo-
ple with low pay would gradually be stripped
of SNAP (formerly food stamps), WIC, Med-
icaid, parts of Medicare, Head Start, school
lunch, legal services, and even tax credits
under the Affordable Care Act.
Due to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the
Virgin Islands Department of Human Serv-
ices Division of Family Assistance executed
both Disaster SNAP—D-SNAP—and regular
SNAP simultaneously. The Virgin Islands
provided D-SNAP to approximately 30,000
households and SNAP to approximately
29,000 households territory-wide. As a result,
members of the community were able to pur-
chase desperately needed food. There are now
approximately 22,000 people on SNAP in the
Virgin Islands.
This is an important a vital program for
Virgin Islanders. There is a 45-day window to
comment on the proposal and the deadline is

ors, that have written in during the

and in opposition to the proposed rule

Re FNS–2018–0037, Revision of Categorical
Eligibility in the Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program (SNAP).
PROGRAM DESIGN BRANCH,
Program Development Division, Food and Nutri-
tion Service, USDA, Alexandria, VA.
AARP, on behalf of its nearly 38 million
members and all older Americans nation-
wide, welcomes the opportunity to submit
comments on the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture’s (USDA) proposed rule to revise cat-
egorical eligibility in the Supplemental Nu-
trition Assistance Program (SNAP). Ensur-
ing that older Americans experiencing food-
related hardship have access to nutrition as-
sistance is a priority for AARP. SNAP pro-
vides critical food assistance for millions of
people, including 8.7 million households with
at least one adult age 50 or older.
AARP BELIEVES THE PROPOSED REVISION TO
CATEGORICAL ELIGIBILITY IN SNAP WILL HARM
LOW INCOME SENIORS AND RECOMMENDS THAT
THE ADMINISTRATION WITHDRAW ITS PRO-
POSAL.
We are deeply concerned that the Adminis-
tration’s proposal would harm older Ameri-
cans’ health and financial security. The pro-
posed rule undermines the intent of SNAP to
alleviate hunger and food insecurity among
low-income households. Additionally, in an
attempt to restrict eligibility for SNAP, the
proposed changes would make low-income
households more financially vulnerable and
more likely to rely on public benefit pro-
grams. According to USDA’s regulatory im-
pact analysis, the proposed rule may ‘‘nega-
tively impact food security and reduce sav-
ings rates among those individuals who do
not meet the income and resource eligibility
requirements for SNAP or the substantial
and ongoing requirements for expanded cat-
egorical eligibility.’’ Similar efforts to limit
broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE) in
the House-passed version of the 2018 Farm
Bill were ultimately rejected on a bipartisan
basis.
USDA estimates that the proposed regula-
tion would eliminate SNAP eligibility for 3.1
million people, disproportionately impacting
households with one or more elderly indi-
vidual(s). Households with elderly members
represent more than one-third of the 1.7 mil-
lion households the Administration esti-
mates would lose SNAP eligibility; mean-
while, those households make up only 24 per-
cent of current program participants. The
eligibility cut would affect 13 percent of
households with seniors, 7 percent of house-
holds with children, and 9 percent of house-
holds overall. Since the cuts would dis-
proportionately harm elderly individuals,
USDA determined that there is a potential
for ‘‘civil rights impacts,’’ which is alarming
to AARP.
SNAP IS CRITICAL TO THE FOOD SECURITY AND
HEALTH OF MILLIONS OF OLDER AMERICANS.
SNAP is the primary source of nutrition
assistance for many people who are strug-
gling to put food on the table. While the pro-
gram provides a modest benefit ($125 a
month on average for households with mem-
bers age 60 or older), it helps recipients meet
their basic food needs. SNAP is an especially
important program for older Americans be-
cause many face challenges to employment,
live on fixed incomes, live alone, and have
limited financial resources to spend on ne-
cessities like food, housing, and essential
medicine.
Unfortunately, food insecurity among
older Americans is already all too common.
An estimated 5.5 million Americans age 60
and older were food insecure in 2017. House-
holds with grandchildren are nearly three
times as likely to be food insecure. The pro-
posed rule would lead to even greater food
insecurity among older Americans.
Older adults who are food insecure are at
increased risk for many negative health out-
comes. They are over twice as likely to re-
port being in fair or poor health relative to
older adults who are food-secure. Compared
to food-secure older adults, they are also 53
percent more likely to report a heart attack,
52 percent more likely to develop asthma, 40
percent more likely to have congestive heart
failure, 22 percent more likely to face limita-
tions of Activities of Daily Living, and 60
percent more likely to experience depres-
sion.
Food insecurity among older adults also
results in significant costs to the American
public, particularly through increased ex-
penditures on health care. Experts widely
agree that nutrition is one of the most im-
portant factors influencing our health.
SNAP participation has been linked to re-
duced hospital and nursing home admissions
among older adults. Research examining
older adults who were dually eligible for
Medicare and Medicaid in Maryland found
that SNAP participants were 23 percent less
likely to enter a nursing home and those du-
ally enrolled were 4 percent less likely to be
hospitalized in the year after receiving
SNAP in comparison to nonparticipants. En-
rolling the millions of seniors eligible but
not enrolled in SNAP could result in billions
of dollars in health care savings.
BBCE ALLOWS LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO
SAVE FOR EMERGENCIES AND BECOME SELF-
SUFFICIENT.
The law governing SNAP, determined by
Congress, sets the income limit and asset
limit for the program, and offers important
options provided to state administrators.
For more than 20 years, states have had the
flexibility to lift the asset tests under SNAP
allowing families to purchase groceries with-
out having to spend down their limited sav-
ings. This allows them to maintain a cushion
that can help them weather future financial
emergencies caused by unexpected health
emergencies, natural disasters, or an unfore-
seen job loss. A basic level of savings can
prevent severe hardship as a result of a fi-
nancial shock and can ultimately reduce the
likelihood that a household will need public
benefits like SNAP.
Currently, 23 states and jurisdictions using
BBCE have no asset limit for SNAP. Under
the proposed rule, states would lose this
flexibility, and SNAP applicants would be
held to the restrictive federal asset limits.
Asset tests disqualify families and individ-
uals from food assistance if they have man-
aged to save as little as $2,250—or $3,500 for
households with elderly or disabled mem-
bers—who may struggle with replenishing
any assets they spend down. This would dis-
courage low-income households from accu-
mulating small but meaningful assets, jeop-
ardizing their financial security and making
it more likely that they will need to turn to
SNAP or other public assistance programs
for support. A recent study found that BBCE
increases the likelihood that a SNAP recipi-
ent has at least $500 in a bank account by 8
percent. By allowing SNAP recipients to
build a reasonable level of preventive savings
under BBCE, households are more likely to
set aside some money and become more self-
sufficient.
THE PROPOSED RULE WOULD INCREASE ADMINIS-
TRATIVE BURDEN FOR STATES AND HOUSE-
HOLDS.
The rule would significantly limit states’
flexibility and make eligibility for SNAP
benefits more restrictive for people in 39
states, Washington D.C., Guam and the Vir-
gin Islands. According to USDA, BBCE re-
duces administrative burdens for State agen-
cies and households and particularly benefits
working households. Under the proposed
rule, 17.2 million households that remain eli-
gible for SNAP, as well as new SNAP appli-
cants, would face additional burdens associ-
ated with the application process. Research
has demonstrated that policies that add bur-
dens to SNAP participation contribute to a
decline in program participation. Instead of
increasing burdens on SNAP applicants, we
call for changes that would make enrollment
in SNAP easier and as seamless as possible.
Application forms, procedures, and program
notices should be shortened, simplified, and
integrated with other government benefit
programs. BBCE currently helps reduce the
complexity of the SNAP application process
and helps to improve state administration
while lowering administrative costs.
Despite the benefits of SNAP, older adult
participation rates in SNAP are the lowest
of any age group. In FY 2017, 84 percent of all
eligible individuals were enrolled in SNAP.
However, only 48 percent of eligible elderly
individuals were enrolled in the program, in-
cluding just 29 percent of elderly individuals
living with other people. A number of factors
already keep eligible older Americans from
receiving benefits, including the complicated
and time-consuming application and enroll-
ment processes. Processes that make enroll-
ment and reporting easier and help overcome

the barriers that keep older Americans from
accessing the food assistance they need are
important for reducing food insecurity
among older adults.
CONCLUSION
We are committed to reducing hunger and
food insecurity among older Americans and
therefore urge the Administration to with-
draw its proposal. SNAP provides important
nutritional support, promotes healthy aging,
and is associated with reduced health care
costs. The BBCE policy in particular also
helps people save and improve their financial
wellbeing. Instead of reducing eligibility for
the program while increasing administrative
burdens, we should be working to further
strengthen SNAP and improve participation
in the program, particularly among eligible
older adults who underutilize the program
more than any other age group. If you have
any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Thank you for your consideration of our
comments.
Sincerely,
DAVID CERTNER,
Legislative Counsel
and Legislative Pol-
icy Director, Govern-
ment Affairs.
THE UNITED STATES CONFERENCE
OF MAYORS,
Washington, DC, September 23, 2019.
Ms. JESSICA SHAHIN,
Associate Administrator, Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program, Program Design
Branch, Program Development Division,
Food and Nutrition Service, USDA, Alexan-
dria, VA.
DEAR ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR SHAHIN:
On behalf of the US Conference of Mayors
(USCM), we are writing to express our strong
opposition to the proposed revision of ‘‘broad
based categorical eligibility’’ in USDA’s
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP) published in the Federal Register on
July 23, 2019. As noted in the proposal’s regu-
latory analysis, this far reaching executive
action will escalate food insecurity and hun-
ger for an estimated 3.1 million individuals—
including children, seniors, and people with
disabilities in our states, regions and cities
nationwide. Furthermore, this proposal will
put children’s health and development at
risk by removing their access to healthy
school meals; and harm our economy by re-
ducing the amount of SNAP dollars available
to spur regional and local economic activity.
As Mayors, we serve as the CEOs of the na-
tion’s cities; and remain most concerned
about any proposal that will reduce improve-
ments to the health of our residents, weaken
nutrition programs, deteriorate advances to
healthy food access, and spur declines in
local and regional economies. USCM has sup-
ported and adopted policies over many years
to eliminate hunger, combat food insecurity
and improve health disparities to build a
stronger society for all residents in our com-
munities. Equally, we have vigorously op-
posed the proposed revision of broad based
categorical eligibility of USDA’s Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program and
rejected this proposal most recently
throughout deliberation of the Farm Bill in
2018.
SNAP remains one of our nations’ key re-
sources in the fight against hunger and is
particularly important to vulnerable popu-
lations in our cities. For instance, 80 percent
of SNAP households include a child, an el-
derly person, or a person with disabilities;
and 85 percent of all SNAP benefits go to
such households. Furthermore, SNAP is not
only a critical resource in the fight against
hunger and food insecurity, but also lifts
people out of poverty. Per the 2017 Supple-
mental Poverty Measure Report, SNAP lift-
ed 3.4 million people—including 1.5 million
children out of poverty in 2017. So, we stand
united and reject any proposal to restrict eli-
gibility to vulnerable adults, children, sen-
iors, and people with disabilities in our cit-
ies.
Research has found that receipt of SNAP
in early childhood improved high school
graduation rates, adult earnings, and adult
health. Mayors recognize that solving child
hunger and poverty is critically important
to also creating a future where all children
thrive. Regular access to healthy and afford-
able meals is one of the strongest predictors
of improved school performance, better
health, and sound childhood development.
Lastly, the proposed rule will harm local
and regional economies, as it is well docu-
mented that the economic gains from public
benefits are even greater than the volume of
direct assistance due to a ‘‘multiplier’’ ef-
fect. USDA has estimated that during times
of economic downturn, every additional $5
dollars in SNAP benefits generates up to $9
dollars of economic activity, and every $1
billion increase in SNAP benefits results in
8,900 full-time equivalent jobs.
Executive action should not be used to
hurt individuals, families and communities;
and we urge you to abandon this proposal.
Our nation cannot remain globally competi-
tive if our children do not have enough to
eat; if our citizens do not have access to af-
fordable health care; if housing and other
basic needs are priced out of reach; and if
adults who are willing and able to work can-
not find jobs that will help them support
their families.

Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker,
may I ask how much time I have re-
maining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from the Virgin Islands has
32 minutes remaining.
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker,
President Trump’s latest attempt to
slash SNAP would be harmful to Amer-
icans across the country, but certain
communities face particular risks. Six
of the groups that Trump’s proposed
rules would hit hardest include rural
communities, Black and Latinx Amer-
ica, people with disabilities, people
with criminal records who are trying
to move on, those in the LGBTQ com-
munity, and women.
Given that 76 percent of rural adults
report that good jobs are scarce in
their areas, rural communities will be
among the hardest hit by Trump’s pro-
posed rule, as it would tie States’
hands and remove the flexibility they
need to help residents of high-unem-
ployment areas put food on the table.
Indeed, while urban areas experi-
enced a net gain of 3.6 million jobs
from 2007 to 2015, rural areas lost
400,000 jobs during that time, meaning

that many rural areas have struggled
to recover from the Great Recession.
b 2000
Additionally, Black and Hispanic
households are especially likely to be
food insecure and thus disproportion-
ately rely on SNAP to help them meet
basic needs, accounting for about 30
percent, and nearly 20 percent of SNAP
benefits in 2016, respectively.
This is due in large part to the sys-
tematic barriers that African Ameri-
cans and Latinx Americans face to
building wealth, purchasing homes, ac-
cessing education, and escaping pov-
erty.
Poverty rates in these communities
are more than double those of White
Americans, and the Black unemploy-
ment rate is still more than twice that
of White workers, despite what is spo-
ken of in the White House. In 2016,
Black Americans’ median wealth was
only $13,460, compared with $142,000 for
White Americans.
People with disabilities:
The proposed rule purports to apply
only to ‘‘able-bodied adults without de-
pendents.’’ What does that mean?
Many of the more than 11 million peo-
ple with disabilities who receive SNAP
assistance could lose that assistance
under the rule, as people who face lim-
ited work capacity due to disability or
poor health are regularly misclassified
as able-bodied for the purposes of
SNAP.
In fact, based on analysis by the Cen-
ter on Budget and Policy Priorities,
the author estimates that 12 percent of
SNAP recipients ages 18 to 59 have at
least one physical, functional, or work
limitation but are not counted as dis-
abled under SNAP.
People with criminal records:
The proposed rule particularly harms
people who come into contact with the
criminal justice system. Nearly nine in
ten employers use criminal background
checks in hiring. This means that even
an old, minor criminal record can serve
as a life sentence to poverty and job-
lessness. As a result, the unemploy-
ment rate among formerly incarcer-
ated individuals is approximately 27
percent. What is more, one study shows
that 60 percent of formerly incarcer-
ated individuals remain unemployed 1
year following their release.
By helping people put food on the
table while they get back on their feet,
SNAP is a powerful tool for supporting
reentry and preventing recidivism. In
fact, one study shows that when for-
merly incarcerated people are sub-
jected to harsher SNAP requirements,
compounded by the substantial bar-
riers they already face, recidivism
rates increase.
Taking SNAP away from workers as
they struggle to rebuild their lives and
reenter the labor market would thus
directly undercut the bipartisan gains
that the President and Congress say
they support in the FIRST STEP Act.
The LGBTQ people:
Trump’s proposed rule would also be
particularly burdensome for the
LGBTQ community. According to a
2017 nationally representative CAP sur-
vey, LGBTQ people are more than
twice as likely as non-LGBTQ people to
receive SNAP benefits, with 26 percent
of LGBTQ women and 18 percent of
men reporting that they or their fami-
lies received SNAP.
The disproportionate receipt of bene-
fits is just one reason that this rule
would be particularly burdensome for
the LGBTQ community. The rule
would especially harm workers because
they are especially likely to face labor
market barriers that make it more dif-
ficult for them to find employment.
Women:
Women make up two-thirds of the
low-wage workforce, making them es-
pecially likely to face the unstable
schedules that would be punished by
the Trump proposal’s punitive time
limits.
In addition to the challenges of low-
wage work, women are disproportion-
ately likely to be caregivers, including
caring for people who may not be con-
sidered dependents under Trump’s pro-
posed SNAP rule. For example, women
are literally 1.4 times more likely than
men to provide unpaid care and help to
people who live outside of their home.
While women struggle to manage the
challenges of unstable low-wage work
and caregiving, they are also more
likely to face workplace discrimination
than men. For example, nearly 36 per-
cent of women who filed sexual harass-
ment charges from 2012 to 2016 claimed
that they faced retaliation as a result,
such as their employers forcing them
out of their jobs or reducing their
hours. Therefore, women who face dis-
crimination may be more likely to be
subject to the proposed rule.
African Americans on average have
the lowest household incomes among
all racial/ethnic groups except Native
Americans. The poverty rate for Afri-
can Americans is almost two times
greater than the general U.S. popu-
lation. These are, in fact, issues that
we all face and should be aware of.
SNAP is a powerful anti-poverty pro-
gram for all people. In a typical month
in 2017, SNAP helped about 13 million
African Americans put sufficient food
on the table. Its benefits lifted about
2.1 million African Americans, includ-
ing 1 million children, above the pov-
erty line in 2015. SNAP also kept 1.2
million African Americans out of deep
poverty—above half of the poverty
line—that year.
Approximately $20 billion in SNAP
benefits, about 30 percent of the total,
went to African American households
in fiscal year 2016.
On average, African American house-
holds that participate in SNAP receive
$260 in SNAP each month, just $260.
A typical participating African
American family of three has an aver-
age monthly income of $940, or 56 per-
cent of the poverty line. When their
$390 SNAP benefit, the average for a
family of three, is added to their cash
income, total monthly income rises by
29 percent, to $1,330.
But this is just an example of what
this administration is doing. One,
going against what this Congress has
already proposed and agreed to, bipar-
tisan support, getting something
across the line, bringing it to the
President’s desk, he signs it, and then
through the administration, agencies,
or executive order, attempting to slash
at the authority of this body, of this
first branch of government, who in
fact, makes laws.
I know that firsthand, as that is ex-
actly what is happening right now in
the Virgin Islands with the disaster re-
lief funding that this body came up
with.
We recall that this body decided that
it was, in fact, going to give the terri-
tories money for disaster relief, and
now we are facing FEMA guidance
delays on new resiliency and rebuilding
provisions.
Additionally, FEMA denying local
administration of FEMA permanent
housing reconstruction programs;
FEMA not willing to advance funding
for major recovery projects, taking too
long to improve major worksheets;
HUD delaying releasing CDBG recovery
funding and segregating it from the
rest of the country; action plan for
unmet needs was approved on March 1,
but still no grant agreement 6 months
later, 2 years after the hurricanes;
FEMA administrations denying cost
share waivers on FEMA aid, which was
given to the Katrina area; refusal to
exercise clear statutory authority to
do this for the Virgin Islands.
This is what this administration ap-
pears to be doing: allowing Congress to
come up with bipartisan legislation,
whether it be SNAP, assistance to
farmers, food programs, disaster relief,
having bipartisan support in both
chambers, getting it across the line,
signing it and then undercutting it, un-
dermining this body, undermining the
democratic process that is in place. We
must do something about it.
In January of 1865, when Union Gen-
eral William T. Sherman issued an
order to allocate 40 acres to each freed-
man, the Black ministers who lobbied
for the policy envisioned vibrant, self-
governed Black agrarian communities
dotting the southern countryside. Un-
fortunately, President Andrew John-
son’s revocation of this order later that
year and the institution of the Jim
Crow regime after reconstruction left
rural Black Americans to build their
farming communities from scratch.
It wouldn’t be the first time the U.S.
Government worked to undermine
Black farmers, and it certainly wasn’t
the last. We are seeing that even today.
Yet, even in the face of broken prom-
ises, not to mention the violence and
discrimination aimed at Black farmers
and Black Americans by White land-
owners and lenders, those farms se-
cured a foothold in American agri-
culture.
At the height of Black farming in
1920, Black farmers operated 925,710
farms, about one-seventh of all farm

operations in the United States. Today,
going from one-seventh, as of 2012,
Black farmers make up less than 2 per-
cent of all farmers.
In the Virgin Islands, we recognize
this. The U.S. Department of Agri-
culture has a long and well-docu-
mented history of discrimination
against Black farmers. The unequal ad-
ministration of government farm sup-
port programs, crucial to protecting
farmers from an inherently risky en-
terprise, has had a profound impact on
rural communities of color.
We have got to stay on this adminis-
tration to make sure that all Ameri-
cans have a fair shot, not only at food
and food security through SNAP, but
also to ensure that those farmers,
American farmers, particularly minor-
ity farmers, have a fair shot at being
part of that food production.
We know that in the Virgin Islands,
our farmers farm very small acreages
of land, but we are hoping and looking
for the support of the USDA to live up
to their example and the ideal that
they are there to support farmers, not
to undermine them; they are there to
support not just the commodities, but
to those specialty crop workers, those
smaller farmers who are providing food
and sustenance to Americans here in
this country.
We know that fresh food is the best
food for our children as part of the
school lunch program, and we must ex-
pand support for the farm-to-the-
schoolroom programs, those programs
that allow local farmers to be the ones
to provide the food for those school
programs that are in place, and not
allow the administration to undercut
any part of the process.
We know that the Congressional
Black Caucus will be vigilant at ensur-
ing that this administration does not
cross the line, and we will be vigilant
at bringing to the American people the
message that this Congress will not sit
back and allow any administration,
Democrat, Republican, anybody, to
shirk their responsibility to the Amer-
ican people.
As the conscience of the Congress,
that is our charge, and we will con-
tinue to do that work.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I
thank my colleague, Congresswoman
PLASKETT for anchoring this Special Order on
support of the Supplemental Nutrition Assist-
ance Program.
I want to express my significant concerns
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s pro-
posed rule to change the determination quali-
fications for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program.
Currently, nearly 36 million people receive
monthly SNAP benefits.
To be eligible for assistance, gross monthly
income must be at or below 130 percent of
the poverty line.
44.4 percent of residents in Houston live at
or below 185 percent of the federal poverty
line.
In the Houston metropolitan area house-
holds with children, 19.3 percent struggled
against food hardships in 2014–2015.
In February of 2018, SNAP served 304,542
households in Houston, bringing in
$82,374,563 of 100 percent federally funded
benefits, generating approximately $147.5 mil-
lion in economic activity.
In Harris County alone, 599,928 people are
eligible for SNAP benefits.
In August of 2019 Harris County received a
total of $70.9 million in totally SNAP pay-
ments.
As a result of the proposal 3 million people
may lose their eligibility for food assistance.
States currently have the flexibility to not cut
off benefits as soon as a family’s gross in-
come exceeds a certain level, but to more
slowly phase out the food aid.
This is to ensure that those who are at or
slightly above the poverty line do not risk fall-
ing below that line.
Additionally, these benefits reduce food in-
security and help alleviate poverty.
The proposed changes would limit this and
cause many families to be abruptly cut off.
The new proposal jeopardizes access to
free school meals for 500,000 low-income stu-
dents.
Not only does this significantly affect fami-
lies but also retired populations that rely on a
fixed income.
This would adversely affect food banks
around the nation as people look for food
elsewhere.
Forcing families to choose between placing
food on the table and covering other important
expenses is unacceptable.
This proposal shows the Republicans’ spe-
cial interest agenda that gives billion-dollar
handouts to big corporations and the wealthy
few, and then steals from children, veterans,
seniors and working families to make up the
difference.
It is both cruel and counterproductive, ignor-
ing the positives that SNAP puts into the
economy by creating $1.79 for every dollar in
benefits.
This proposed rule change does not help
and support low-income individuals and fami-
lies meet their basic human needs.
The current Administration is rejecting the
overwhelmingly bipartisan passage of the
2018 Farm Bill, which made smart improve-
ments that strengthened the safety net for
food-insecure families.
This Administration must commit to imple-
menting the bipartisan agreement to make
anti-hunger initiatives more effective.
House Democrats will always stand firm for
the health, well-being and dignity of America’s
working families, and will continue to advance
our For The People agenda to deliver lower
health care costs, bigger paychecks and
cleaner government that fights for the public
interests, not the special interests.
Thus, I urge the administration to reconsider
this proposal and look at the adverse effects
that it will have on our society.

The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal God, give our lawmakers the
power to live with purity. Remind
them that for each test and tempta-
tion, You have provided a way of es-
cape. When they stumble, help them to
receive the forgiveness of Your abound-
ing grace. May they permit Your spirit
to control their minds and hearts, con-
tinually delivering them from evil.
Lord, we cannot live with integrity
in our strength alone, so keep us
united with You.
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to address the
Senate as in morning business for 1

f
THE UNITED STATES SENATE
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President,
we have been hearing from the other
body a lot about how the Senate isn’t
taking up House bills. Now, that seems
to be as though the Senate is supposed
to somehow be a rubberstamp for the
other body.
Well, we just celebrated Constitution
Day last week, and the Constitution
doesn’t provide for the Senate to auto-
matically take up bills from the other
body. Maybe it is time for a reminder
about how the Founding Fathers in-
tended the Senate to work, so I am
going to give a short quote by James
Madison in the Federalist Papers, No.
62, entitled ‘‘The Senate’’:
The necessity of a senate is not less indi-
cated by the propensity of all single and nu-
merous assemblies, to yield to the impulse of
sudden and violent passions, and to be se-
duced by factious leaders into intemperate
and pernicious resolutions.
I am not saying that the House of
Representatives passes intemperate
and pernicious resolutions, but at least
the Founding Fathers thought that
could happen, and they had the Senate
to be a check on the House of Rep-
resentatives, just as the House of Rep-
resentatives can be a check on any-
thing that we do.
There are now over 80 bills that have
passed both Houses, but there are some
that can’t pass the Senate, and there
are probably some the Senate feels
shouldn’t even be brought up. The dif-
ference between the House and Sen-
ate—and some contemplation by the
Senate to be very cautious—is how the
Constitution meant the Senate was
supposed to work. I hope leaders of the
House of Representatives will be re-
minded of that from time to time. That
is my purpose today.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
HONORING CHRIS HULSEY
Mr. MCCONNELL. First, this morn-
ing, I join the Kentucky families and
first responders in Meade County in
mourning the loss of volunteer sheriff’s
deputy Chris Hulsey, who was killed in
the line of duty over the weekend. Ac-
cording to reports, on Saturday
evening, Deputy Hulsey was attacked
while investigating a suspect and pro-
nounced dead at the hospital hours
later.
Deputy Hulsey proudly answered the
call of public service with a decades-
long career that also included time as
a firefighter and a paramedic. His serv-
ice left his community safer, and his
sacrifice left it in grief. I stand with
them in mourning his loss and hon-
oring his service. The community will
hold a candlelight vigil tonight to
honor this Kentucky hero. The prayers
of the Senate will be with them.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on an entirely different matter, the
Senate continues making headway in
the personnel business.
It is still too bad that our Demo-
cratic colleagues continue to insist on
cloture votes, floor time, and rollcall
votes for the kinds of uncontroversial
nominees who have ordinarily traveled
by voice vote for past administrations
of both parties. Yet the Senate hasn’t
been deterred by this novel campaign
of systematic obstruction from our
Democratic friends. We will keep right
on getting these talented public serv-
ants on the job, where they belong.
Later today, we will confirm a Dep-
uty Under Secretary of the Treasury.
Then we will confirm an ambassador, a
solicitor of a Cabinet department, and
a deputy commissioner of Social Secu-
rity. They aren’t the only nominees we
will confirm this week. Before our
work is finished, we will also have con-
firmed our next Vice Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs and, pending the com-
mittee action of our colleagues, our

f
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
this week, we will also address our re-
sponsibility to keep the Federal Gov-
ernment funded.
The Republicans regret that our
Democratic colleagues have chosen to
back away from the agreement we all
reached just last month to ensure a
smooth, bipartisan funding process. We
regret that the Democrats chose to
block funding for the national defense,
including a pay raise for our men and
women in uniform, in order to pick a
partisan fight with the White House.
Yet, for the sake of the country, our
near-term priority is that of passing a
continuing resolution so the govern-
ment can stay open while work con-
tinues. I am glad the continuing reso-
lution on the table earned significant
bipartisan support across the Capitol
and has also earned the green light
from the White House. The Senate will
vote on it this week. As Chairman
SHELBY and Senator LEAHY continue
their work on regular order appropria-
tions, I hope the cooperation that has
surrounded this CR can carry over and
that we can get the appropriations
process back on track.
f
THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on yet another matter, the productive,
bipartisan work that needs to happen
in the Senate will stand in stark con-
trast to the choices made by the House
Democrats across the Capitol.
Over there, it seems as though a far-
left socialist ideology is increasingly
becoming mainstream Democratic
Party doctrine, and rather than roll up
their sleeves and work with the Repub-
licans and with the White House on
proposals that could actually become
law, the House continues to promote
one dangerous leftwing policy after an-
other.
The Senate has already voted on the
Green New Deal, the Democrats’ social-
ist wish list that seeks to outlaw af-
fordable energy and transportation,
eliminate the jobs many Americans
rely on, and even empower government
bureaucrats to redesign families’
homes. Needless to say, it didn’t do too
well. Here in the real world, out of the
college campus atmosphere that seems
to characterize the House Democrats,
the Senate voted it down. I have al-
ready discussed the recent House-
passed bill that would have cut down
on our domestic energy and American
energy independence.
We also all know about Medicare for
None, which is the plan the Democrats’
Presidential candidates are rushing to
embrace, that would literally outlaw
the existing health insurance 180 mil-
lion Americans currently get on the
job and throw everyone into an untest-
ed, one-size-fits-all government plan.
Just last week, Speaker PELOSI ex-
panded on the Democrats’ Medicare for
None philosophy by introducing a bill
to micromanage Americans’ medicine
and start trying to have Washington,
DC, run the prescription drug industry
because, if there is anything that has
been proven to increase competition
and affordability for American fami-
lies, it is huge, new doses of heavy-
handed Washington, DC, interference.
No, we will not let the Democrats
take us down the path that embraces
the socialist concept of starting to na-
tionalize an industry with people de-
voted to finding cures and saving lives.
The life sciences sector is driving the
search for cures to Alzheimer’s, Par-
kinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and count-
less other diseases that impact mil-
lions of Americans.
The Speaker and her caucus may be
content to spend their majority pass-
ing leftwing messaging bills, but in
this Senate, we take the American peo-
ple’s priorities more seriously, and we
will stick to getting their business
done.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE
AGREEMENT
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in
just a few days, we will mark the 1-
year anniversary of the President’s
concluding negotiations on the United
States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade
Agreement. It is time for Congress to
ratify this agreement now.
The United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement will benefit pretty much
every sector of the U.S. economy: the
automobile industry, textiles, digital
trade and e-commerce, services, manu-
facturing, and yes, of course, agri-
culture.
As the representative of a State
whose lifeblood is agriculture, farmers
and ranchers are always at the top of
my mind, and a huge focus of mine
right now is helping our struggling ag-
ricultural economy.
Low commodity and livestock prices,
natural disasters, and protracted trade
disputes have made a tough few years
for our Nation’s farmers. One of the
most important things we can do to
help our agricultural economy recover
is to open new markets for American
agricultural products.
During August, I spent a lot of time
talking to farmers back home in my
State of South Dakota. Again and
again, they emphasized that they need
action on trade from Washington. With
so many trade deals currently up in the
air, farmers and ranchers are strug-
gling with a lack of certainty about
what international markets are going
to look like.
While they share the President’s goal
of addressing trade imbalances and se-
curing more favorable conditions for
American products, they also believe
that we need to conclude the agree-
ments that we are negotiating as soon
as possible. The longer negotiations
drag on, the tougher their situation
gets. That is why I have repeatedly
stressed the need to bring these agree-
ments to a swift conclusion, and I em-
phasize that point to the President
nearly every time I talk to him.
However, there is one deal we don’t
need to wait for, and that is the United
States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade
Agreement. As I said earlier, negotia-
tions on this agreement concluded a
year ago, and it is high time for Con-
gress to take it up and pass it so that
farmers and ranchers can start seeing
the benefits.
The United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement is a big win for farmers and
ranchers. Of particular interest to
South Dakota are the agreement’s
dairy provisions. Dairy is an important
and rapidly growing industry in South
Dakota. Drive the I–29 corridor north
of Brookings, SD, and you can see first-
hand the massive dairy expansion that
we have experienced over the past sev-
eral years.
The United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement will preserve U.S. dairy
farmers’ role as a key dairy supplier to
Mexico, and it will substantially ex-
pand market access in Canada, where

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5637
September 24, 2019
U.S. dairy sales have been restricted.
The U.S. International Trade Commis-
sion estimates that the agreement will
boost U.S. dairy exports by more than
$277 million.
The agreement will also expand mar-
ket access for U.S. poultry and egg pro-
ducers, and it will make it easier for
U.S. producers to export wheat to Can-
ada, and so much more.
Above all, this agreement will pro-
vide farmers and ranchers with cer-
tainty about what the Canadian and
Mexican markets are going to look like
going forward. American farmers de-
pend upon these markets to sell their
products, and it is vital that farmers
have a clear idea of what these mar-
kets are going to look like in the fu-
ture.
Republicans in the Senate are ready
to take action on the United States-
Mexico-Canada Agreement at any
point. I hope House Democrats will
quickly work out their remaining
issues and indicate their willingness to
vote on this deal. The administration
has made addressing Democrats’ con-
cerns a priority throughout the nego-
tiation process, and it is time for
Democrats to bring this process to a
swift conclusion.
As I mentioned, we are almost a year
now past the time when the President
signed this agreement, and it has been
available for consideration by the
House of Representatives for that en-
tire time. It is high time that we act
on this trade deal and get it over here
to the Senate, where we can vote on it
and get it to the President for his sig-
nature.
Last week, seven former U.S. Agri-
culture Secretaries, from both Demo-
cratic and Republican administrations,
sent a letter to House and Senate lead-
ership stating their strong support for
the United States-Mexico-Canada Free
Trade Agreement.
The Secretaries noted:
With farmers facing one of the lowest net
farm incomes in the last decade, USMCA
would create enhanced export opportunities
and help fully capitalize on increased global
demand for food products. Furthermore,
USMCA would significantly boost farm in-
comes and create jobs both on and off the
farm in rural communities.
Again, that is from seven former U.S.
Agriculture Secretaries, serving both
Republican and Democrat Presidents.
Life hasn’t been easy for our Nation’s
farmers and ranchers over the past few
years, and I can certainly attest to
that, as I have looked at what the
economy in South Dakota has been
like in these last several years. The
surest way that we can stabilize and
boost farm income and help farm coun-
try is to conclude agreements like the
USMCA. I urge my Democrat col-
leagues in the House of Representa-
tives to make getting this deal done in
the House, over to the Senate, and
across the finish line their No. 1 pri-
ority.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
UKRAINE
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we
continue to read reports containing ad-
ditional information about the nature
of President Trump’s phone calls with
Ukrainian President Zelensky and his
administration’s conduct in the weeks
and months before and after those com-
munications.
Ignoring for a moment the political
reporting, we know that someone in-
side the intelligence community found
the President’s conduct alarming
enough to warrant an official whistle-
blower complaint. The complaint was
so alarming that the inspector general
of the intelligence community, ap-
pointed by President Trump, said that
it was credible and urgent and a com-
plaint that by law must be submitted
to Congress. This is not one of those
discretionary moments; the law says
this must be transmitted to Congress.
We still have not received the whis-
tleblower complaint, and Congress has
been advised in writing by the inspec-
tor general of the intelligence commu-
nity that the Trump administration is
preventing us from getting this report.
So later today, I will request the unan-
imous consent of the Senate to pass a
resolution calling for the whistleblower
complaint to be provided to the Senate
and House Intelligence Committees, as
prescribed by law. Let me repeat that.
Later today, I will request the unani-
mous consent of the Senate to pass a
resolution calling for the whistleblower
complaint to be provided to the Senate
and House Intelligence Committees, as
prescribed by law.
It is our job in the Congress to pro-
vide the necessary oversight of the ex-
ecutive branch, to take these matters—
matters of foreign policy, national se-
curity, and constitutional integrity—
with the utmost gravity, to seek the
facts, and then grapple with them.
I made several requests of the major-
ity leader yesterday in an effort to col-
lect the facts, to which I have received
no response. Today, I will seek ap-
proval for a simple resolution calling
for the whistleblower complaint to be
transmitted to the relevant commit-
tees in Congress. I hope the majority
leader and Senate Republicans will not
block it. I hope they will rise to the oc-
casion and realize that this is their
constitutional duty and realize that
this involves the security of the United
States.
I will have more to say on the matter
before requesting my colleagues’ con-
sent to pass this resolution later today.
DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Madam President, on the national
emergency—another issue that in-
volves rule of law and the President’s
overreach—this week, as early as to-
morrow, the Senate will vote on wheth-
er to terminate the President’s na-
tional emergency declaration, which he
has used to steal from our military to
build the border wall—a wall President
Trump promised over and over again
that Mexico would pay for; not Amer-
ican taxpayers, not American troops,
not their families—Mexico. That was
the President’s promise to the Amer-
ican people. It is a promise he broke.
But that is what it has come to.
If my Republican friends choose to
stand with President Trump on this
vote, they will be supporting the Presi-
dent’s taking money from our military
and their families to fund a border
wall. I imagine that even many of
those who support the wall—and that is
not a majority or close to a majority of
Americans—would not want the money
to come from the military.
Later this morning, Democrats will
have a press conference where we will
talk about this. We will remind people
that the consequences of the Presi-
dent’s emergency declaration are far-
reaching. He is taking money away
from military readiness, military fami-
lies, and the children of servicemem-
bers. He is taking money from military
medical facilities in North Carolina
and hurricane recovery projects in
Florida, money from programs we use
to combat Russian cyber aggression
and money to upgrade storage facilities
that are decrepit and pose a risk be-
cause of the munitions that are stored
there.
What the heck are we doing here?
Congress appropriated these funds with
a specific purpose. In our Constitution,
the President doesn’t get to decide
where the money goes; we do. He gets
veto power. He tried to shut down the
government and failed. If he can get
around the constitutionally sanctioned
balance of power—that is what a dic-
tator does, not someone who believes
in democracy and rule of law.
What he has done here far exceeds
any overreach that my Republican col-
leagues complain about that President
Obama did. But, remarkably, too many
are silent. Too many are willing to go
along. The fear of this President, who
many of my colleagues know privately
does not have the honor, morality,
honesty, and actually competence to
do this job—they know that, but they
go along with just about everything he
does.
On a policy basis, you can shrug your
shoulders. That is the differences be-
tween the parties. But when it comes
to defending the Constitution and rule
of law and not letting the Executive
overreach—the No. 1 fear of the Found-
ing Fathers—we are above that. Where
are our Republican colleagues?

I am sure if the shoe were on the
other foot and a Democrat were Presi-
dent and declared an emergency to re-
appropriate funds, my Republican col-
leagues would be up in arms. As I men-
tioned, when President Obama did far
less, they were screaming bloody mur-
der. But now they are remarkably si-
lent.
So it is about time our Senate Re-
publicans stand up for the rule of law,
stand up for our Constitution, and
stand up to the President when he is
wrong. It is time to reassert the powers
of the legislative branch, the people’s
branch of government. Senate Repub-
licans will have that opportunity this
week, likely tomorrow, and the Amer-
ican people will clearly be able to see
whose side each Republican is on—the
people’s side, the Constitution’s side,
or the President’s side.
NOMINATION OF DANIEL HABIB JORJANI
Madam President, finally, on the
Jorjani nomination, later today, the
Senate will vote on the confirmation of
Daniel Jorjani to serve as Solicitor of
the Department of the Interior. By all
rights, Leader MCCONNELL should with-
draw this vote from the floor. Mr.
Jorjani’s career is out of step with the
agency’s mission, and it has come to
light that Mr. Jorjani likely lied to
Congress about his role in the Depart-
ment’s adherence to transparency laws.
Under President Trump, the Interior
Department has been mired in several
investigations about the ethical con-
duct of its political appointees, includ-
ing former Secretary Zinke. It is obvi-
ous that the Interior Department sore-
ly needs transparency and public ac-
countability, especially when the stew-
ardship of our public lands is at stake.
But at the Department of the Interior,
political appointees have instituted
policies to stonewall and squash trans-
parency. It is likely that Mr. Jorjani
played a key role in shaping these poli-
cies and is at this moment one of the
subjects of an Interior Department in-
spector general investigation.
Despite his sworn testimony claim-
ing no role in reviewing public records
requests, public documentation has
shown that Mr. Jorjani was regularly
made aware of FOIA requests involving
high-level political appointees. If con-
firmed, Mr. Jorjani would play an even
larger role in overseeing the Interior
Department’s public releases.
The President said he would clean
the swamp. Nomination after nomina-
tion that he makes, makes the swamp
even filthier, stinkier. He seems to
have no morality. He seems to have no
honor. This is a man who is loaded with
conflicts of interest, ethical concerns,
and is likely an ideologue opposed to
the very missions of the agency to
which he is nominated. Mr. Jorjani is
another bright red example of the lack
of honor, of decency, of morality, and
of honesty in Trump appointees. I urge
Senate Republicans to join Democrats
in voting to reject this sordid nomina-
tion.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois.
ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President,
there are certain elements of this re-
sponsibility of serving in the Senate
that have been tested from time to
time in our history.
As Members of the Senate, each of us
stands in the well right over in that
corner, raises our right hand, and
swears to uphold and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States. Those
words are almost a cliche because they
are used so often. Yet here today we
are being called on to really reflect on
that responsibility. We are called on to
reflect on it because of things that
have happened that have come to light
in the last several days that raise seri-
ous constitutional questions.
I will say that in the 21⁄2 to 3 years
that Donald Trump has been President
of the United States, I think our Na-
tion has been rocked by this Presi-
dent’s approach to the highest office in
the land. He has said things and done
things no other President has ever
done.
Members of his own political party
have been uncharacteristically silent
when it comes to criticizing this Presi-
dent for his wrongdoing. The litany of
things he has done is long and trou-
bling. But there is one thing that we,
as both political parties, need to main-
tain as the bedrock of this democracy,
the bedrock of our commitment to this
Constitution; that is, that in this Na-
tion of the United States, the people
govern.
Ultimately, the people of the United
States have the last word—in our elec-
tions. In those elections, they make
their choices, whether you like them or
not. I wasn’t particularly enamored
with the Presidential choice in 2016,
but I accepted it as the constitutional
verdict of the American people. It real-
ly is the bedrock of who we are and
what we are. That is why the notion
that some other nation would interfere
in our election is so repugnant.
The thought that the American peo-
ple would not have the last word, that
there would be other factors and other
people, other countries engaged in our
election, is as reprehensible under our
Constitution as any concept I can
think of.
We are sworn to defend the Constitu-
tion of the United States against all
enemies, foreign and domestic—an-
other group of words we have heard
over and over again. But reflecting on
those for a moment—sworn to defend
the Constitution of the United States
against all enemies, foreign and domes-
tic—is a nation that tries to interfere
in our political process an enemy of the
United States? Of course. That is obvi-
ous on its face. Those who would en-
courage a nation to be engaged in our
political process, to try to tip the
scales one way or the other, are they
enemies of the United States? Well,
they are certainly not acting con-
sistent with that constitutional prin-
ciple.
This seems like a pretty straight-
forward constitutional interpretation.
You don’t need a Ph.D. or a law degree
to understand, if a foreign country
tries to interfere in the U.S. election
process, that foreign country is an
enemy in that action. Those who would
encourage a foreign country or foreign
agents to engage in our election, they,
too, have crossed the line.
As I consider the revelations that
President Trump is using his office to
extort Ukraine to support his political
reelection campaign, I wonder why
there is so much silence on the other
side of the aisle. This is an outrageous
development.
Months before the 2016 election, our
Nation’s top intelligence officials told
key congressional leaders about the ef-
forts of Russia to interfere in the 2016
election, the election where the Amer-
ican people were choosing the Presi-
dent. Our top intelligence officials
were understandably concerned. At
that time, President Obama asked our
congressional leaders for a bipartisan
message condemning Vladimir Putin’s
efforts on behalf of Russia. President
Obama wanted to make sure it was bi-
partisan before that 2016 election and
showed a unified resistance to the in-
terference by any foreign country in
America’s election process.
What was the response of the Repub-
lican majority leader, Senator MCCON-
NELL, after hearing this bombshell, this
threat from a former Communist KGB
official, Vladimir Putin, against Amer-
ica’s democratic process of election?
He answered that he didn’t want to get
involved, and he didn’t.
Then, for months after the election,
not a single Republican Senator spoke
on the Senate floor about the mount-
ing and devastating evidence of Rus-
sia’s attack on our election in 2016. I
know that, personally, because the
first casualty in that attack was the
voter file of my State of Illinois. The
Russians found a way, through their
trolls, to get into the voter file of my
home State, into the voting records of
70,000 or more Americans who live in Il-
linois. What did they do with that in-
formation? It appears little or nothing,
but they could have changed it, and
they could have had a dramatic impact
on the right of these American citizens
to make their legitimate constitu-
tional choice in the election.
For months, the silence was deaf-
ening as well, as President Trump de-
fended Vladimir Putin’s brazen denials
of these attacks. President Trump took
the word of Vladimir Putin over that of
his own American intelligence profes-
sionals. Senate Republicans blocked
election security measure after elec-
tion security measure, and despite fi-
nally relenting last week when Senator
MCCONNELL said we could come up with
$250 million for election security
grants, they still continue to block
substantive legislation, despite ongo-
ing attacks and U.S. vulnerability.
The country spent much of the
Trump Presidency asking serious, nec-
essary questions about Candidate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5639
September 24, 2019
Trump’s open solicitation of Russian
help in his Presidential campaign and
if such cooperation actually ran deep-
er. While unable to establish a formal
conspiracy between the Trump cam-
paign and the Russians, in nearly 200
pages, the Mueller report described
‘‘numerous links between the Russian
government and the Trump Cam-
paign.’’
The Mueller report also laid out, in
detail, how the Russians brazenly and
systematically interfered in our elec-
tion in 2016 and tried to shape the out-
come. You would think that after such
a sobering set of findings, any Amer-
ican President would take the matter
seriously and reassure the Nation that
he really does put America, not a for-
eign power, first when it comes to our
electoral process, but, no, shortly after
the Mueller report was released, Presi-
dent Trump told ABC’s George
Stephanopoulos he would still accept a
foreign government’s offer to share
damaging information about a political
rival, echoing similar remarks he made
in his original Presidential campaign.
In short, President Trump learned
nothing from the experience of the 2016
election. The silence of my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle seems to
indicate the same.
Now we have reports that President
Trump is at it again, trying to strong-
arm the leader of Ukraine to join him
in attacking one of President Trump’s
political rivals, Joe Biden. It is not to
advance American interests, not to
serve the American people, not to help
an ally in Ukraine, not to uphold
American values but to serve the Presi-
dent’s own reelection campaign inter-
est.
Last week, I offered an amendment
in the Appropriations Committee to
address $250 million which had been ap-
propriated by Congress to help protect
Ukraine from Russian aggression and
was never released. Last Thursday, I
had this amendment coming before the
committee, and it basically said to the
administration: If you don’t release the
money we have appropriated, you are
going to pay a price for it.
Occasionally, that is all you can do
as a Member of Congress to get money
spent that was appropriated and ap-
proved by the President. It was a curi-
osity. Why in the world were we hold-
ing back $250 million that was supposed
to help the Ukrainian people stop the
aggression of Vladimir Putin?
I went to the committee hearing on
Thursday morning. Before it started,
one of my staff members said: Oh, the
Trump administration released the
money last night.
Last night? Why did they wait until
2 weeks before the end of the fiscal
year to release the money?
Oh, they were reviewing this to de-
termine whether there was any prob-
lem with releasing the money to
Ukraine.
It was a curious answer. It didn’t
make much sense. The President had
signed this appropriations bill.
For months, as President Trump,
through his personal attorney Rudy
Giuliani, tried to pressure Ukrainian
President Zelensky to further his polit-
ical agenda, the money that was sup-
posed to go to Ukraine was withheld.
We learned in this morning’s Wash-
ington Post the President had in-
structed his Chief of Staff to notify the
appropriate agencies to withhold the
money while he bargained with
Zelensky over salacious, negative in-
formation about Joseph Biden and his
family.
Now we are learning there was a
whistleblower complaint, reportedly
about the same issue. Apparently,
someone in the administration who
learned what President Trump was try-
ing to do in strong-arming Ukrainian
President Zelensky decided it over-
stepped the bounds and needed to be re-
ported on officially. The congressional
Intelligence Committees that get ac-
cess to the information provided by
this whistleblower are still waiting for
that information—information the
Trump-appointed inspector general for
the intelligence community, Michael
Atkinson, a Trump appointee, has de-
termined to be credible and urgent. In
other words, something happened at
the highest levels of our government
which led a professional in the intel-
ligence agency, the inspector general,
to make a whistleblower complaint for
the record.
The law requires that complaint to
be shared with committees of Congress.
It wasn’t. It turns out that the Attor-
ney General of the United States, Wil-
liam Barr, may have played some role
in diverting that from its ordinary
statutory course. The President may
not want anyone to see it, but the law
is clear and must be respected: This in-
formation in the whistleblower com-
plaint must be transmitted to Con-
gress.
Is there anyone in the Senate, any-
one who took the oath to protect the
Nation against enemies foreign and do-
mestic, who thinks any of us, regard-
less of political party, should solicit
help from a foreign power to make sure
we get elected or reelected?
This abdication of responsibility by
the other party is remarkable. I want
to salute one Senator, and I hesitate to
mention any direct reference to him,
but one Senator on the Republican side
who has spoken out. He understands
the gravity of the situation, the con-
stitutional issues at stake in this de-
bate, and the fact that, ultimately, his-
tory must stand in judgment of all of
us of whether we have spoken up.
If this President of the United States
can attempt to extort a foreign leader
to withhold security funds that would
have been given by the United States
to his country in order to pursue and
promote his own political agenda, we
have reached a new low in the United
States. If this whistleblower’s claim
goes into detail, it is only right and ap-
propriate, under the statute, that this
information be shared with the appro-
priate committees of the U.S. Senate
and House. The whistleblower’s claim
needs to be released to the appropriate
congressional committees and evalu-
ated according to the law, and congres-
sional Republicans—House and Sen-
ate—need to make it clear once and for
all that no President—not this Presi-
dent, no President—can solicit or
strong-arm a foreign country to fur-
ther his own campaign. That is unac-
ceptable under the Constitution of the
United States, which I remind my col-
leagues we are sworn to uphold and de-
fend.
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF DANIEL HABIB JORJANI
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, over the
past 21⁄2 years, we have seen a remark-
able pattern emerge in the types of
people Donald Trump nominates to
serve in his administration. His nomi-
nees have extensive conflicts of inter-
est. They work to advance the interest
of foreign clients, financial patrons, or
other special interests. In doing so,
they are actively hostile to the very
departments in which they have been
nominated to serve.
Daniel Jorjani—the President’s
nominee to serve as Solicitor of the De-
partment of the Interior—is a classic
example of this pattern. The DOI Solic-
itor is a critically important position
in the Department. In addition to being
the chief legal adviser to the Sec-
retary, the Solicitor is intimately in-
volved in developing the legal justifica-
tions for Department policies, defend-
ing DOI positions in court, and over-
seeing compliance with the Freedom of
Information Act, FOIA.
Given the influence the Department’s
Solicitor has on issues, such as the im-
plementation of the Endangered Spe-
cies Act, stewardship of public lands,
and holding companies accountable for
their impacts on the environment, it is
essential that whoever occupies this
job can execute his or her duties in a
manner that upholds the public trust.
With the nomination of Daniel
Jorjani, Donald Trump has once again
shown that he prioritizes exploiting
our environment for the benefit of fos-
sil fuel companies over the very real
interests of the American people and
protecting our environment.
Prior to joining the Trump adminis-
tration, Mr. Jorjani spent 7 years
working in organizations throughout
the Koch brothers’ sprawling empire.
In positions such as the general coun-
sel of Freedom Partners, Mr. Jorjani
assisted the Koch brothers in pursuing
a relentlessly pro-fossil fuel agenda. He
fought against the Obama administra-
tion’s actions to combat climate
change and protect the environment.
It was with precisely this experience
in mind that Donald Trump appointed
Mr. Jorjani as the Principal Deputy
Solicitor and Acting Solicitor of DOI in
2017. During his tenure in these roles,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5640 September 24, 2019
which did not require Senate confirma-
tion, Mr. Jorjani wasted little time be-
fore mounting a full frontal assault on
Obama-era environmental regulations,
to the delight of his former patrons. Of
the eight Solicitor’s legal opinions that
Mr. Jorjani authored, seven roll back
Obama-era environmental regulations.
Let me focus on one example that
certainly sticks out. In a stunning re-
versal of a 2017 opinion issued by then-
Solicitor Hilary Tompkins, Mr. Jorjani
pushed to shield companies from liabil-
ity for killing birds protected under
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act as long
as it was not the company’s intended
action.
That is like saying BP shouldn’t have
to pay to clean up the Deepwater Hori-
zon oilspill because they didn’t intend
to release nearly 5 million barrels—200
million gallons—of oil into the Gulf of
Mexico. Clearly, companies should not
be shielded from their negligence.
Mr. Jorjani’s reversal of the opinion
overturned existing Department en-
forcement practices that had been in
place for the past 40 years. The oil and
gas industry had been complaining
about this rule for years precisely be-
cause it held them accountable for
their actions.
When I asked Mr. Jorjani directly at
his confirmation hearing about which
industry benefited most from this re-
versal decision of his, he claimed: ‘‘I’m
not aware of any particular industry
that benefits from this.’’
Who is he trying to kid? My reaction
to Mr. Jorjani’s shibai—or BS—answer
is that the oil and gas industries are
the biggest beneficiaries. He knew it,
and I knew it.
Mr. Jorjani’s actions are particularly
alarming in light of a new study that
found that North America has lost 3
billion birds—nearly 30 percent of our
total bird population—in the past 50
years.
In normal times, we expect leaders of
the Interior Department to pursue poli-
cies to mitigate the harm being done to
our ecosystems and environment, not
to do things that will actually make
big problems even worse. But these are
not normal times.
Instead, we have yet another Trump
nominee with extensive conflicts of in-
terest, pursuing policies that help his
former employers in a manner that is
fundamentally hostile to the Depart-
ment in which he or she serves.
Fitting the Trump administration’s
normal pattern of corruption should be
more than enough to deny him con-
firmation to this critical job, but Mr.
Jorjani—just like his boss, Interior
Secretary David Bernhardt—is also
currently under investigation by the
DOI inspector general.
Mr. Jorjani is under investigation for
potential misconduct related to his
management of the Department’s com-
pliance with the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act, or FOIA, and its so-called
supplemental review policy.
Under this policy, political ap-
pointees at the Department are noti-
fied about the public release of any
documents containing their names or
email addresses. This policy can be
problematic even in normal times. It
could result in political interference in
the FOIA process to delay the release
of potentially damaging information,
but DOI allegedly has an additional in-
ternal review policy that goes even fur-
ther. It allows Mr. Jorjani and the De-
partment’s Deputy Chief of Staff 5 days
before release to review requested
records that involve senior staff in the
Secretary’s office. This review process
not only opens up the possibility for in-
appropriate delays but also allows for
willful and blatant withholding of im-
portant information the public has re-
quested.
In response to questions at his con-
firmation hearing and questions for the
record, Mr. Jorjani asserted that he
‘‘typically did not review records prior
to their release under the FOIA.’’ How-
ever, internal documents released by
the DOI paint a very different picture,
one in which Mr. Jorjani was regularly
involved in reviewing FOIA documents.
At best, Mr. Jorjani was not forth-
coming or candid. In fact, it appeared
that he lied under oath.
With a position as important as this
one, the American people deserve, at
the very least, an ethical Solicitor de-
voted to the mission of the Depart-
ment, one who is not compromised by
or catering to the narrow interests of
his former employers or one who
doesn’t tell his staff, as Mr. Jorjani
told his staff, that ‘‘at the end of the
day our job is to protect the Sec-
retary.’’ Protecting the Secretary is
nowhere in Mr. Jorjani’s job descrip-
tion. He is yet another Trump nominee
who should not be confirmed by the
Senate.

NO BUDGET NO RECESS ACT AND END-OF-YEAR
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT
Mr. President, ‘tis the season in
Washington. Government agencies are
going on their ‘‘Christmas in Sep-
tember, use-it-or-lose-it’’ shopping
spree. If not spent by midnight on Sep-
tember 30, leftover dollars expire and
can no longer be used.
Rather than returning the money to
taxpayers, binge-buying bureaucrats
are wasting billions of taxpayer dollars
needlessly. Frankly, folks, this is
Washington’s most notorious tradition
at the end of our fiscal year.
Let me tell you, folks, Iowans and
hard-working folks across the country
really should be appalled by many of
the last-minute purchases our tax dol-
lars are paying for. I will just give you
some examples.
There was $4.6 million spent on lob-
ster tail and crab; $2.1 million spent on
games, toys, and wheeled goods; over
$53,000 on china and tableware; more
than $40,000 on clocks; and nearly
$12,000 for a commercial foosball table.
Yes, that is right, folks, a commercial
foosball table, 12,000 of your dollars.
What are we, as Congress, doing
about this wasteful spending? Nada,
nothing. Congress is sitting idly by,
letting Washington bureaucrats waste
the hard-earned dollars of folks in my
home State of Iowa.
Failing to pass the bills necessary to
fund the government on time makes it
difficult for agencies to thoughtfully
plan and allocate billions of dollars.
That is why I fought hard to make sure
Congress completes its job of appro-
priating and budgeting on time.
Through my No Budget No Recess
Act, Members of Congress would be
prohibited from leaving Washington if
we fail to pass a budget by April 15 or
if we fail to approve regular spending
bills by August 1.
The way we are doing business is
incentivizing Federal agencies to rush
and spend the rest of their money as
quickly as possible, and it makes it all
the more likely that they will waste
money on unnecessary goods and serv-
ices.
As Iowa taxpayers know, it is never
smart to rush into a big purchase. Un-
fortunately, it seems Washington bu-
reaucrats don’t agree, especially when
it is the tax dollars of hard-working
Americans that they are dealing with.
Washington’s spending disorder gets
more expensive every year. The $97 bil-
lion rung up in September 2018 is 15
percent more than was spent the same
month the previous year and a stag-
gering 39 percent more than that time
in 2015. But if the Federal agencies fol-
lowed the President’s directive to trim
their budgets by 5 percent, an easy
place to start is simply by cutting the
dollars they have been unable to spend.
Federal agencies end every year with
leftover money in their budgets. This
year, it is estimated the government
will end up with more than $825 billion
in unspent funds that have not been
committed by contract or otherwise
obligated to be spent. Last year’s $804
billion budget deficit could have been
wiped out and turned into a surplus if
the unobligated balance being held in
the Federal coffers had been canceled.

September 24, 2019
Instead, Federal agencies ordered lob-
ster tail and tons of—get this—tater
tots—tons of tater tots, as Washington
amassed its largest shortfall since 2012.
Folks, we have to put an end to this
madness. Seriously, someone has to be
the Grinch on behalf of our taxpayers.
That is why earlier this year I intro-
duced the End-of-Year Fiscal Responsi-
bility Act.
My bill would limit an agency’s
spending in the last 2 months of the
year to no more than the average of
the previous 10 months. This bill will
not end all wasteful spending, but it
will force agencies to put more thought
into long-term planning and curtail the
bad habit of out-of-control impulsive
spending.
Folks, Washington spending is out of
control. With our national debt now
surpassing $22 trillion, Washington
should be looking for ways to save by
canceling or delaying unnecessary ex-
penses rather than splurging on end-of-
the-year wish lists.
I would like to recognize the great
work of the nonpartisan group
OpenTheBooks, which is working to
put every dime the government spends
online in real time to hold Washington
accountable. The group issued a report
on this very subject in March.
I would also like to note that Iowans
sent me to the Senate with a specific
mission: Cut wasteful spending, and
make Washington squeal. To prevent
buyer’s remorse, I am giving everyone
in Washington fair warning. My office
will be reviewing your last-minute pur-
chases and asking you to justify them
to the taxpayers.
It is time to put an end to this reck-
less behavior. Billion-dollar binge buy-
ing is no way to budget.
Thank you.

NOMINATION OF DANIEL HABIB JORJANI
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there is
a job opening at the Interior Depart-
ment, and that can mean only one
thing: another Trump nominee who, in-
credibly, is already under investigation
for misconduct, even before his first
day on the job. This time, it is Daniel
Jorjani, a long-serving Trump Interior
official who is up for a powerful role as
the Department’s Solicitor.
I say to the Presiding Officer and col-
leagues, I have put a hold on this nomi-
nee. If anything, the case for with-
holding action on this nominee has
gotten greater in the last few days.
Just in the last few days, the Depart-
ment’s inspector general has made it
clear that this is an individual he is
going to investigate. I will tell my col-
leagues that, if you are putting some-
body already under investigation on a
fast track to the Interior Department
corruption hall of fame, right up there
with Ryan Zinke, I believe that is a
mistake the Senate is going to regret.
It probably doesn’t take an inspector
general investigation to uncover why
this is a mistake. I am going to explain
it this morning, briefly.
First, I believe it is important to
start with an honest assessment of
what Donald Trump appointees have
done at the Interior Department.
Under this President, it is often dif-
ficult for one agency’s corruption to
stand out above the rest, but somehow
Interior Department officials manage
to do that again and again.
Mr. Jorjani, a former industry ad-
viser for Koch Industries, is an example
of just this type of behavior. The Office
of the Interior Solicitor is in charge of
legal issues and ethics for the Depart-
ment. It is a big team with a lot of
power. Mr. Jorjani has been a key
member of the Solicitor’s office.
His own words indicate that he
doesn’t believe that his primary func-
tion at Interior is to protect public
lands and uphold ethical standards. We
have already heard discussion earlier
this morning that he wrote to agency
colleagues—and we have been quoting
it—saying ‘‘our job is to protect the
Secretary.’’ Those are his words, not
the words of anybody here in the Sen-
ate. What Senators may not know is
that Mr. Jorjani was talking about
Ryan Zinke, who brought on a category
5 ethical hurricane during his brief
time as Interior Secretary.
In the same email, Mr. Jorjani boast-
ed about having impeded inspector gen-
eral investigations into the misuse of
taxpayer funds for travel. It wasn’t
just talk. The record shows that cov-
ering up dirty ethics and potential
lawbreaking is routine for Mr. Jorjani.
By my count, there are at least four in-
vestigations into wrongdoing at the In-
terior Department that were closed or
found inconclusive due to a lack of co-
operation or records production on Mr.
Jorjani’s watch.
These investigations covered a mul-
titude of issues, from the potential
misuse of expensive chartered travel to
a halted study on the crucial health
impacts of potentially dangerous Inte-
rior Department energy policies.
Then there is the issue of the Interior
Department’s new policy under the
Trump administration with respect to
the Freedom of Information Act. The
new policy—and again, this is a retreat
from public interest standards—gives
political appointees unprecedented
control over the Department’s response
to Freedom of Information Act re-
quests. In my view, it looks like an ef-
fort to conceal the fact that Trump In-
terior officials are spending their days
doing the bidding of a host of special
interests.
There is clear evidence that this new
secretive Freedom of Information Act
policy was implemented under the
Trump administration, that Mr.
Jorjani knew about it, and that he was
up to his eyeballs in putting this in
motion.
When I asked Mr. Jorjani about the
Freedom of Information Act policy
during an Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee hearing, Mr.
Jorjani actually claimed it didn’t
exist. He later told one of our col-
leagues, the distinguished Senator
from Maine, Mr. KING, that he had no
involvement in Freedom of Informa-
tion Act responses.
I want it understood that I believe
Mr. Jorjani lied to the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee and perjured
himself to that body.
Colleagues, I know that Members on
both sides are concerned about what
has happened with the Freedom of In-
formation Act under this administra-
tion. I want to commend the several
Republican Senators who have said
that they are troubled about what this
administration is doing with the Free-
dom of Information Act—the so-called
‘‘awareness reviews’’ by appointees
that really aren’t hard to figure out. It
is about secretive political inter-
ference.
What we are seeing with the Freedom
of Information Act is inconsistent with
the intent of Congress, and it is wrong.
The importance of government open-
ness and honesty with the American
people ought to be a bipartisan propo-
sition. It is in the interest of every-
one—Democrats and Republicans—to
protect the Freedom of Information
Act from evasion and protect it from
abuse. That is part of why this new In-
terior policy on the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act is so troubling.
As I mentioned, on Friday, the Inte-
rior inspector general confirmed to me
that Mr. Jorjani is currently under in-
vestigation for his role in this Freedom
of Information Act policy. For col-
leagues who may be following this,
let’s just understand what is going on:
We are getting ready to vote on wheth-
er to advance somebody who is under a
formal inspector general investigation.
The fact that the inspector general is
investigating such a serious matter
ought to be enough all by itself to stop
this nomination from going forward.
Certainly, Mr. Jorjani’s own words
about how he views the job—not about
protecting the public but about pro-
tecting someone like Ryan Zinke—
ought to be disqualifying. If Mr.
Jorjani is confirmed, the person who
will be in charge of ethics at the Inte-
rior Department told colleagues his job
was to protect a crook. That is what he
said.
Colleagues, this administration in
too many instances has made deceit
and unethical conduct the norm at the
Interior Department. Trump officials
have sidelined the Department’s core
purpose, which is to protect our treas-
ured public lands on behalf of all Amer-
icans. Too often, it seems, they side
with special interests that will pollute
America’s air, poison the drinking
water, fuel climate change, and destroy
the treasures that Americans all love.
At some point the U.S. Senate ought
to draw the line. I think the Jorjani
nomination is such a place.
I urge my colleagues to oppose the
nomination. I urge my colleagues to
join me in voting no.
I yield the floor.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE
AGREEMENT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
want to address an issue for my col-
leagues, something a lot of Senators
have been talking about more recently,
and none too soon—the Mexico-Canada
agreement with the United States, a
very important trade agreement.
President Trump and the leaders of
Mexico and Canada signed the USMCA
on November 30, 2018, which was 43
weeks ago. More than 3 months have
passed since Mexico ratified the
USMCA, and Canada’s ratification is
well underway. However, the U.S. Con-
gress must do its part, and time is run-
ning short.
We have a limited opportunity to rat-
ify the USMCA before election politics
get in the way of securing this very
critical win for literally every broad
industry sector in America. I therefore
urge the administration and House
Democrats not only to intensify discus-
sions on the USMCA but also to expe-
dite those discussions and to present
USMCA to the Congress.
By now, everyone should know very
well that Mexico and Canada are by far
America’s most important trading
partners. In 2017, America sold more
than a half trillion dollars of exports to
Mexico and Canada. Those were more
exports than we sold to the next 11
largest export markets combined. For
Iowa, my State, 130,000 jobs were sup-
ported by the $6.6 billion of exports to
Mexico and Canada in the same year of
2017.
These numbers are not just academic
statistics. During the August State
work period, I completed my 39th year
holding Q and A’s in every one of
Iowa’s 99 counties, and I consistently
heard from Iowans that passing the
USMCA ought to be a very top priority
for the Congress.
I joined the former Governor of Iowa
and former U.S. Secretary of Agri-
culture, Tom Vilsack, at a dairy proc-
essing plant in Des Moines. This meet-
ing, with one Republican and one Dem-
ocrat appreciating the great contribu-
tions of Iowa agriculture to our Nation
and to exports, demonstrated what I
heard at my town meetings—that pass-
ing the USMCA should be a bipartisan
priority.
In Cedar Falls, IA, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture Under Secretary,
Bill Northey, and I held a roundtable
discussion with various commodity
groups about the farm economy and
the certainty that passing USMCA
would bring to the agricultural com-
munity, particularly to the family
farmers.
USMCA was also a focal point when I
held meetings at manufacturing plants,
such as Altec in Osceola, IA, and AIM
Aerospace in Orange City, IA. I can
state firsthand that people in the real
world—people living outside of the
Washington Beltway—want Congress
to pass the USMCA as soon as possible.
My county meetings help me better
represent Iowans, and it is clear to me
that Iowans support the USMCA. We
can’t squander this opportunity to up-
date NAFTA, which has been critical
to American farmers and businesses
but is now a quarter century old. Issues
negotiated in the USMCA were not
issues 25 years ago, showing just how
out of date NAFTA is, as well as the
importance of the USMCA.
USMCA will bring greater market ac-
cess for agriculture and important new
commitments in areas such as cus-
toms, digital trade, intellectual prop-
erty, labor, the environment, currency,
and nontariff trade barriers. These up-
dates and upgrades will translate into
higher wages, greater productivity, and
consequently more jobs for Americans.
In fact, the independent U.S. Inter-
national Trade Commission found that
USMCA will create nearly 176,000 new
American jobs while adding more than
$68 billion to America’s GDP.
Let’s not forget, USMCA was a hard-
fought negotiation. For Mexico, two
Presidents worked across opposing ad-
ministrations to get this job done. Can-
ada initially held out of the agreement
altogether, only to sign on at the last
possible opportunity.
It is easy for Members of Congress to
talk about how we would have nego-
tiated the agreement differently. There
is some talk like that going on. That
would be true whether you are a Re-
publican or Democrat. However, as the
U.S. International Trade Commission
report made very clear, USMCA is a
major advancement from the 25-year-
old NAFTA agreement. This is cer-
tainly true for labor and the environ-
ment, which were mere side agree-
ments to NAFTA 25 years ago. Now
these issues addressed in USMCA are
some of the strongest obligations ever
to have been included in any U.S. trade
agreement. Simply put, we can’t let
the perfect be the enemy of the good,
and calling the USMCA ‘‘good’’ would
be a serious understatement.
The administration did its job and
brought us a modernized trade agree-
ment. Nevertheless, the administration
has listened to the concerns of House
Democrats and has proposed actions to
address those concerns. For my part, I
have kept an open mind throughout
this process, and I welcome any work-
able, bipartisan solutions. However,
given the political calendar that lies
ahead, I need those solutions promptly.
We simply don’t have any more time to
spare.
Iowans and all Americans deserve
some much needed certainty on access
to our half-trillion-dollar export mar-
kets in Mexico and Canada, and it is
the job of this Congress to deliver. The
time for USMCA is right now.
I yield the floor.

ator from Wyoming.
BUDGET DEFICIT
Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to
call attention to our Federal Govern-
ment’s unsustainable fiscal path.
Earlier this month the Congressional
Budget Office reported that Federal
VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:38 Sep 25, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24SE6.003 S24SEPT1

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5644 September 24, 2019
revenues are up 3 percent, or $102 bil-
lion, compared to the same time period
last year. The problem is that Federal
spending grew by 7 percent, or $271 bil-
lion, over that same period. CBO
projects the deficit for this year to
reach $960 billion, which means that 22
cents of every dollar the government
spends is borrowed.
All of that borrowing doesn’t come
cheap. In the first 11 months of the
year, net interest payments on the
public debt totaled $391 billion. That is
up $48 billion, or 14 percent, over the
previous year.
To put that in context, $391 billion is
roughly 21⁄2 times what we spend each
year on the U.S. Air Force. It is more
than 12 times the size of the budget of
the entire U.S. Department of Justice
and more than 5 times the size of the
budget for the U.S. Department of Edu-
cation. That is $391 billion spent with
nothing to show for it. It is just like
running up credit card debt and owing
a whole bunch of interest without get-
ting anything for it. That is what our
future generation is really going to
have to worry about.
What is worse, unless something is
done to change our current trajectory,
annual net interest costs are projected
to more than double in the next 10
years. CBO projects that over the next
decade we will spend more than $5.8
trillion on net interest costs. All the
while, our debt will continue to mount.
That doesn’t pay down anything; that
just pays the interest, and that is cal-
culated at a pretty low interest rate.
We could be faced with higher interest
rates, which could easily double what
we are paying right now.
We have been fortunate that despite
Congress’s spendthrift ways, the U.S.
dollar remains the dominant global re-
serve currency, which allows our gov-
ernment to borrow more cheaply than
anybody else. But what if that
changes? What if foreign interests de-
cide that our fiscal dysfunction is sim-
ply too great and the dollar is no
longer a safe bet?
The threat of a fiscal crisis is not
something anyone should take lightly.
Last month, the CBO—that is the Con-
gressional Budget Office, which does
all the calculations—warned: ‘‘If Fed-
eral debt as a percentage of [gross do-
mestic product] continued to rise at
the pace the Congressional Budget Of-
fice projects that it would under cur-
rent law . . . [t]hat debt path would
[ultimately] pose significant risks to
the fiscal and economic outlook.’’
While the Congressional Budget Of-
fice notes that those risks are not cur-
rently apparent in financial markets,
it goes on to warn that the projected
path of rising debt would increase ‘‘the
risk of a fiscal crisis . . . in which the
interest rate on federal debt rises
abruptly because investors have lost
confidence in the U.S. government’s
fiscal position.’’
As a father and a grandfather, this is
a concern that keeps me up at night.
What kind of burden are we placing on
our children and on our grandchildren?
They could face a future of less growth
and economic opportunity as a result
of our refusal to make difficult fiscal
decisions.
What if we actually had to make
massive cuts? We don’t make cuts at
all. What if we had to do massive cuts?
Of course, we could raise revenue, but
there is always the side effect of rais-
ing revenue, which costs jobs and then
reduces revenue. There are a lot of
tricky balances that have to be done.
This problem didn’t arise overnight,
and it will not be fixed overnight ei-
ther. Congress should be working to-
gether with the administration now to
begin the long process of fiscal course
correction. Unfortunately, we are not
off to a great start.
Prior to the August State work pe-
riod, Congress passed the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2019, which increased dis-
cretionary spending caps for fiscal
years 2020 and 2021 by a combined $322
billion. That is the increase. This es-
sentially marks the end of the Budget
Control Act period of federal budg-
eting. In a form that was all too com-
mon, a tool that was meant to bring
fiscal constraint met its end with a
whimper, when it probably should have
been a scream.
The last cap deal—which CBO tells us
will cost nearly $2 trillion over the
next 10 years if we continue spending
at those levels over that time period—
featured $77 billion in offsets.
What is an offset? That is finding
some money to cover the amount of
spending. I think you heard correctly
there. The cap deal put us on a path to
spend nearly $2 trillion over the next 10
years with $77 billion—billion with a
‘‘b’’—in offsets, which is money to
cover the debt. To make matters
worse, those offsets will not even begin
to kick in until the latter part of the
next decade. In other words, we are
saying there is a little patch of money
out there that we haven’t spent in the
future yet, and it isn’t going to come
in for 10 years, but let’s go ahead and
spend it right now, and we will call
that an offset to reduce the amount of
debt we are creating. Boy, everybody
wishes they could do that with their
own spending, I am sure.
The offsets—the money to cover the
debt, which is the mere $77 billion on $2
trillion—will not come in until the lat-
ter part of the next decade. In other
words, we are spending money from 10
years down the road right now and
calling it payment on the money we
are spending.
Even with this turn of events, every-
one seems to agree that discretionary
spending is not the main source of our
budget challenge. The Congressional
Budget Office projects America’s debt
will continue to increase rapidly over
the next several decades because of
mandatory spending.
What is mandatory spending? That is
spending we don’t make a decision on
at all. Those payments go on no matter
what, and they are pretty important
ones because they include things like
Social Security and the major health
programs and interest on the debt.
That is mandatory. We can’t bankrupt
on paying the interest, so Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest
on the debt are some of the main ex-
penditures we make, and we never
make any decisions on them. We do not
change them. We don’t improve them.
For decades, nonpartisan experts
warned of budget pressures we would
face as baby boomers aged and began to
retire. That is already happening, but
that crisis is always tomorrow. We
only handle today’s crises. I can’t
imagine how tomorrow’s people are
going to handle the crisis that is being
created at the present time. The com-
bination of aging population, longer
lifespans, and rising per beneficiary
healthcare costs put enormous pressure
on our budget.
These warnings from the Congres-
sional Budget Office, the actuaries, and
many other people, you name it, con-
tinue to be ignored. We are now in a
world where these pressures are very
real and something we will need to face
before we go off the cliff in a few short
years.
We know the Social Security trust
fund and Medicare’s Hospital Insurance
Trust Fund are now paying out more
than they are taking in. We also know
Social Security’s combined trust funds
will be exhausted in 2032. ‘‘That is way
down the road.’’ No, it is not. The
Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust
Fund—which covers inpatient hospital
services, hospice care, skilled nursing
facilities, and home health services—is
projected to be depleted in 2026. That is
not very far. If we continue to do noth-
ing once their respective trust funds
are exhausted, these programs will still
be able to pay out some money, but
they will only be able to pay out as
much in benefits as they have coming
in. I mentioned that we have a lot less
coming in than we are paying out. For
Medicare, that means we will only be
able to pay 86 percent of hospital-re-
lated Medicare spending. For Social
Security, revenue is projected to cover
only 76 percent of scheduled benefits. I
don’t know many seniors who can af-
ford a 24-percent cut.
I want to make sure Social Security
and Medicare are able to provide bene-
fits to current beneficiaries, as well as
those who need them in the future.
That will require being clear-eyed
about the problem and working to-
gether in a bipartisan manner to en-
sure that these programs are solvent.
The normal technique on trying to
solve any of these problems is to point
the finger at the other side and say it
is their fault and they are not doing
anything about it. Well, we are all
going to have to do something about it.
We are talking about a 24-percent cut
in Social Security.
The longer we wait to address the im-
balance, the more severe the changes
will be and the fewer options we will
have. I remember looking at these

problems in the year 2000, and at that
time there were quite a few options,
but all were rejected. Today there are a
lot less options and a bigger cliff. We
need to change the way we do things in
Washington. We simply cannot afford
to continue ignoring the challenges our
country faces.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia.
Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I
rise to talk about a topic that is boring
at times but is absolutely critical, as
you just heard in the last few minutes.
My good friend from Wyoming, Senator
ENZI, is a certified public account. He
lived in the real world before he came
here, like I did. He is chairman of the
Budget Committee. When he speaks
about this, he speaks with the level of
experience and current information
that we all should listen to.
I want to highlight some things he
has already talked about but then talk
about the potential we are looking at
this week in terms of having our 187th
continuing resolution since the 1974
Budget Act was put into law. Why is
this important? As Senator ENZI just
pointed out, our problem in America is
twofold; one, we have a global security
crisis, and we have a financial crisis. I
use the word ‘‘crisis’’ in both because
the world has never been more dan-
gerous in my lifetime.
Today we have $22 trillion in debt.
Let me put a little history behind it. In
the year 2000, we had $6 trillion on
about a $12 trillion economy. At the
end of President Bush’s time, it went
to $10 trillion of debt—again, on some-
thing like a $14 trillion or $15 trillion
economy. At the end of President
Obama’s term, it went to $20 trillion.
Under that administration, this gov-
ernment doubled America’s debt to $20
trillion. After just a couple of years of
President Trump, we are now at $22
trillion.
The projection is very draconian over
the next decade, even though, by grow-
ing the economy in the last couple of
years, the Trump administration has
actually lowered the debt curve by an
estimate that CBO says is about $3 tril-
lion over the next decade. That is not
good enough. That is only a fraction of
our problem.
This chart on the right talks about
the problem. I call it the LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER chart because when we talked
about it 2 years ago, we started bring-
ing this chart up. Working on the budg-
et process is one of the ways we deal
with this. This burgeoning debt that we
have to talk about is really made up of
one major contributing factor; that is,
mandatory expenses.
This chart tries to explain that. It
shows that the top line here is total
U.S. spending. Today we spend about
$4.5 trillion—a little bit more—but
about $4.5 trillion funding the Federal
Government. That includes everything:
Military, Medicare, Social Security,
Medicaid—the whole bit. The Federal
Government spends about $4.5 trillion
on everything.
The red line is today. Today, how-
ever, we only spend $1.3 trillion on dis-
cretionary spending. Yet in terms of
the total, in 2000 we spent less than $2
trillion. Now we are spending more
than $4 trillion. That has doubled in
the last two decades. These are con-
stant 2019 dollars.
In the next 20 years, this is projected
to go from $4 trillion to $12 trillion per
year, each year. In 1 year projected out
here, we would almost double the
amount of debt we have. This is unten-
able under anybody’s estimate. It can’t
happen. It will not happen. Here is
why. The world can’t let it happen.
Today we have about $200 trillion in
total debt. Only $60 trillion of that is
sovereign debt, which is government
debt. We have one-third of that. This
says that because of mandatory spend-
ing, primarily, we will go to almost
half of the world’s debt with 5 percent
of the population. That is not going to
happen.
Yet what will happen to keep us from
doing that or becoming that will be
really draconian unless we act today.
Senator ENZI is right. The sooner we
act, the more alternatives and options
we have. Let me try to explain the sit-
uation. We are actually spending less
today in discretionary spending at $1.3
trillion as a percentage of our economy
than we did in 2011. In 2011, we were
spending 9 percent of our total GDP on
discretionary spending.
What is in discretionary spending?
That is the military, most of the VA,
and all discretionary spending, such as
Health and Human Services, Labor, Ag-
riculture, Justice Department, Treas-
ury. All of the above are included in
that. That is $1.3 trillion today, which
is about 6 percent. We have gone from
9 percent GDP to 6 percent GDP. Dis-
cretionary spending has actually been
brought down.
What is the problem? The problem is
in mandatory. What is in mandatory?
As Senator ENZI just said, mandatory
is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,
pension benefits on Federal employees,
and the interest on the debt. Just in
the next 2 years alone, mandatory
spending goes up $420 billion. I can
project that. That is within range of
understanding. What I don’t under-
stand is how this really explodes out of
control. This is because the baby
boomers are maturing and going into
the later years of their lives. As you
just heard, both Social Security and
Medicare—major trust funds—go to
zero in a very short period of time.
Medicare happens in 2026 and Social Se-
curity in 2032.
I am here to tell you this is the crisis
of our time, and we have to deal with
it. Yet today we are about to go into
our 187th continuing resolution. Why?
Because we don’t have an agreement to
fund the government. We are at the end
of our fiscal year, which is September
30. We have 2 working days left, the
way the Senate works, before that hap-
pens. It could still be fixed, but the re-
ality of today is that we have not ap-
propriated one dime for the Federal
Government yet.
Last year, going into August break
on July 31, we had only funded 12 per-
cent of the Federal Government. Be-
cause we stayed here in August, we
funded up to 75 percent of the govern-
ment. That was the first time in 22
years that we had gotten that far. As a
matter of fact, in the last 45 years, this
Congress has only funded the Federal
Government on time four times. We
have actually shut the government
down 21 times because of the lack of
funding. That is almost once every 2
years. It is unbelievable.
This year, in July, we had an agree-
ment. We did a caps deal between the
Democrats and Republicans. It was a
bipartisan deal. Everybody went
kumbaya and said: Yes, this is what we
agreed to. We agree to this topline
number. Appropriators had already
been working all year. We had agree-
ments in committee. All we had to do
was come back in September and ap-
propriate these bills, go to conference
on the NDAA, and get the Defense De-
partment funded along with the other
major departments and go ahead down
the road and get the government fund-
ed.
Here we are at the end of September.
That obviously did not happen. Why?
Our good friends across the aisle vio-
lated what we thought was a good-faith
agreement in July that there would be
no poison pills when we started appro-
priating. We see clearly now that
wasn’t the case. They are holding this
up over $5 billion that the President
wants to move from military spending
over to border security spending. It is
almost like they want open borders. I
just don’t understand this.
We know President Obama built 135
miles of wall, and we know one thing
now. We know that where President
Obama built a wall, where President
Bush built a wall, where President
Clinton built a wall, where President
George H. W. Bush—in every single
case, illegal crossings at the border
went down 95 percent.
By voting no on this spending bill, we
are now getting into a situation where
we have to go into a continuing resolu-
tion. Last week, we voted on the De-
fense bill, and Democrats voted it
down. They voted against a 3.1-percent
pay increase for our military brethren.
What is even worse than that, by
going into a continuing resolution and
by voting no last week, the Democrats
are encouraging the Defense Depart-
ment to actually spend $4 billion. We
did an audit last year. It was the first
one in the history of the United States.
President Trump ordered it. We had a
law in 1991 that required it. Now we
had that audit. This is the first pass.
This is the tip of the iceberg. Because
of that, we know that we found at least
$4 billion that they don’t want to con-
tinue spending, yet are going to be
obliged to continue to spend against
those obsolete programs under a con-
tinuing resolution, in addition to not

getting a pay raise to our people in the
military.
We should not have been here in the
first place. We had a joint select com-
mittee last year, and we have been
working on this for 5 years. It is time
to fix this budget process once and for
all. We have to hold Congress account-
able, though. In most States, we don’t
have this problem. In 44 States, No. 1,
you have a balanced budget law, but
more importantly than that, in States
like Georgia, if the legislature doesn’t
fund the government by the end of the
legislative session, by law, the legisla-
tors don’t go home.
Senator LANKFORD and I and others
have bills that would require the same
thing here. As a matter of fact, some of
us have actually put in bills that would
stop the pay for staff and employees
and would stop Members’ compensation
until we get this done. A requirement
of our job here is to get the govern-
ment funded.
It is very simple. It is time for Con-
gress to do its job. I am chagrined that
we face another continuing resolution
that we have educated people about
and will cost hundreds of billions of
dollars over a decade because of the
damage it will do to the supply chain
when we are trying to get readiness
and recapitalization back in our U.S.
military and talk about rationaliza-
tion. It keeps us from doing each of
those three things right now.
Anybody in the military who is be-
fore us in committee tells us over and
over and over of the damaging effects a
continuing resolution has on our mili-
tary at the very time when we are try-
ing to stand up to peer pressures in a
unique, new way. We have five threats
across five domains. We have never
faced that before. Yet here we are,
hamstringing our military once again.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
SAUDI ARABIA
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President,
last weekend, the world watched as an
attack was launched on the oil proc-
essing infrastructure of the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia. The attack initially re-
duced Saudi Arabia’s daily output ca-
pability by half, and that represents
about 5 percent of the daily global pro-
duction. Oil prices around the globe
spiked by as much as 19 percent before
starting to fall on the news that there
was enough oil in reserves around the
world to deal with any short-term re-
duction from Saudi Arabia. One of
those reserve nations they were talk-
ing about, of course, included this
great Nation, the United States.
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is
important to maintain. I think we all
recognize that, especially in light of
the attack on Saudi Arabia. Yet I have
always believed and had the mindset
that we need long-term energy supply
solutions in this country. As the at-
tack on Saudi Arabia has displayed,
there is no foreign substitute for Amer-
ican energy.
Should this attack on Saudi Arabia
have happened before our Nation’s en-
ergy renaissance, we would have been
in a much worse situation. The near
monopolistic control other nations
once had on the oil and gas market no
longer exist—a credit to American in-
genuity and innovation. Over the last
decade, we have had a turning point in
this country on energy, which is some-
thing that leaders around the world
talk to and point to in the United
States. We have produced more oil and
gas, we have improved energy con-
servation, and we have diversified our
energy sources.
In 2015, we got rid of another hand-
cuff to securing energy independence.
We lifted the export ban on oil. That
policy change both boosted America’s
domestic energy industry and is help-
ing today to settle markets after the
attack in Saudi Arabia. Lifting the ban
has unleashed millions of barrels of oil
into the marketplace, which has kept
prices steady and reduced the influence
of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and
Russia. Think about that, what the
United States has done to reduce that
influence.
According to the U.S. Energy Infor-
mation Administration, U.S. petroleum
and natural gas production increased
by 16 percent and 12 percent respec-
tively in 2018. These totals combined
established a new production record.
The United States surpassed Russia in
2011 to become the world’s largest pro-
ducer of natural gas and surpassed
Saudi Arabia in 2018 to become the
world’s largest producer of petroleum.
Last year’s increase in the United
States was also one of the largest abso-
lute petroleum and natural gas produc-
tion increases in history from a single
country.
The United States continues this
trend toward energy independence, and
that is a good thing. Yet, despite these
successes, there are those who want to
not just stop this trend but who fully
intend to reverse our energy independ-
ence. Some of my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle have endorsed a
Federal fracking ban. They want to
ban the very production that gave us
energy independence, that gave us
independence from OPEC and Russia.
They have endorsed ending fossil fuel
exports, and they have endorsed elimi-
nating energy development on Federal
land. Yet, tell me, do any of these poli-
cies actually result in more affordable
energy prices? Do these policies make
energy more reliable? Do these policies
keep the price at the pump down? Do
these policies keep our allies across the
globe safer? Do these policies keep our
troops safer?
Let’s take gas prices. If my Demo-
cratic colleagues were truly concerned
about the impact of gas prices on their
constituents’ pocketbooks, I am curi-
ous if any of them would come up with
a calculation of what gas prices would
be after the ban of hydraulic frac-
turing, the stopping of exporting fossil
fuels to the global market, and the
stopping of energy development on
Federal land. What would the price be?
I guarantee you that there wouldn’t be
very much opportunity or at least very
much comfort for their constituents.
Over 20 percent of the crude oil pro-
duced in this country in 2018 came from
Federal land. There is little doubt that
eliminating 20 percent of the supply of
oil would have a significant impact on
gas prices. Yet that is exactly what
several have called for. Fracking has
extended the productive life and re-
source recovery at the Bakken, Eagle
Ford Shale, Marcellus Shale, Niobrara,
and Permian Basin formations, just to
name a few.
As a matter of fact, the U.S. Geologi-
cal Survey published an updated as-
sessment of the Permian Basin’s re-
sources in 2018. By itself, the Permian
already produces one-third of the Na-
tion’s oil, and the updated assessment
estimates that over 46 billion barrels of
oil, 280 trillion cubic feet of gas, and 20
billion barrels of natural gas liquids
are trapped in these low-permeability
shale formations. The Nation’s supply
of oil and gas reserves essentially dou-
bled in the blink of an eye, according
to that report.
Colorado’s Western Slope is home to
the Piceance Basin. In 2016, the USGS
issued a similarly larger reassessment
of the recoverable resources in the
Piceance. The USGS estimated mean
volumes of 66.3 trillion cubic feet of
gas, 74 million barrels of oil, and 45
million barrels of natural gas liquids.
The Uinta-Piceance Basin that cov-
ers western Colorado and eastern Utah
has an abundant supply of natural gas
that could be exported through a west
coast liquefied natural gas terminal,
like Jordan Cove, to our allies in the
Pacific.
We have enough energy resources to
meet our domestic needs and to meet
the needs of energy overseas. So let’s
relish that fact. Rarely do we have a
chance to provide economic opportuni-
ties here at home, to provide energy se-
curity to our partners abroad and
make sure our allies have those oppor-
tunities as well, and to use the innova-
tion and the investments we have made
here to weaken our enemies all in one
area, like in energy production.
Let’s think about what the world
would look like if we had not moved in
the direction of increased domestic
production in recent years.
The decline of Venezuela’s oil pro-
duction over the last 12 years and the
resulting political instability in the
country would have hurt the import
ability of the United States. OPEC and
Russia would have a significantly larg-
er role than they do today in deter-
mining the global production levels,

and we have seen how that has played
out for the United States in the past.
We could very well be where China is
today—overly dependent on imports
from Saudi Arabia and terrified at the
slightest hiccup in its production abil-
ity, which could have far-reaching con-
sequences for our economy or, rather,
we would find ourselves exactly where
we were in 1973.
That is where we will end up if my
colleagues get their way and ban en-
ergy production, hydraulic fracturing,
or pass the Green New Deal, as they
would like. These policies would make
us once again dependent on foreign
sources of energy and make us vulner-
able to the geopolitical manipulation
that comes with that dependence.
As recently as 2005, we were depend-
ent on imports for two-thirds of our oil
consumption—more than twice what
we were reliant on in 1973 when we had
a supply crisis during the embargo. If
that were still true today, this attack
on Saudi Arabia would be a significant
cause of concern for the United States
and for the U.S. oil supply. Yet, be-
cause of the pursuit of energy inde-
pendence in the United States and the
security we have achieved through
these innovations and developments,
we are confident that we can weather
short-term supply disruptions in the
global market.
Banning production, banning the de-
velopment of energy in Colorado, or
implementing policies like the Green
New Deal would kill not only our op-
portunity to be energy independent and
weather the storm of a global supply
crisis, but it would also kill millions of
jobs around the United States that pay
far above average wages. The oil and
gas industry supports over 10 million
jobs in the United States, and it ac-
counts for almost 8 percent of the gross
domestic product of the United States.
The jobs have an average salary of over
$100,000 a year. These are good-paying
jobs that enable people to provide for
their families, contribute to domestic
energy security and our goal of energy
independence, and they will allow us
the ability to send a responsibly devel-
oped resource to our allies overseas
who want a dependable trade partner.
Many of my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle, though, simply want
to do away with this industry, those
jobs, those salaries, that freedom, the
independence, and the prosperity that
it brings.
Instead of talking about putting our
traditional energy sources out of busi-
ness, why don’t we talk about hard-
ening our energy infrastructure, pro-
tecting these critical assets, and con-
tinuing to responsibly produce those
resources for us, the environment, and
for the world? Doing so is a win for the
United States. It is also a win for our
communities and those who wish to
partner with us in order to fuel the
world’s economy.
It is incredibly important that we
have energy independence, and I can’t
think of a more disruptive crisis the
world could have faced had this hap-
pened in a country in which we no
longer had the production that we do
today. I hope we can work together on
energy policies that continue to create
jobs and grow the American economy.
I yield the floor.

BLACKBURN). The Senator from Colo-

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. CON. RES. 10
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President,
several months ago, members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
had the opportunity to sit down with
the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo,
to talk about a number of concerns
around the globe, including our con-
cerns about Huawei and ZTE and the
fact that Huawei and ZTE pose serious
threats to the national security of the
United States and its allies.
At the time, there had been a lot of
discussion about what was happening
in Europe and other places around the
globe and about whether Huawei would
be allowed to participate in our allies’
networks and what that could mean for
U.S. national security and our ability
to continue to engage in national secu-
rity conversations, intelligence oper-
ations, sharing of information, and the
like.
In that conversation, Secretary
Pompeo said—and this was the entire
group of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, both Republican and
Democratic Members—in that con-
versation, Secretary Pompeo said that
what would help would be to let
Congress’s voice be heard when it
comes to Huawei and ZTE and that we
should send a strong message to our al-
lies that our concern with Huawei and
ZTE is not a Republican issue, it is not
a Democratic issue, it is not just a one-
term-of-Congress concern, but it is an
ongoing concern that we have with the
security of our systems, our informa-
tion, the lack of security and the vul-
nerability that Huawei and ZTE net-
works and equipment pose to the
United States; that we send a message
to our allies in a bipartisan, bicameral
fashion that if they go forward and
allow Huawei or ZTE to have access to
their critical infrastructure networks,
then that is going to pose problems for
the United States; that we may have to
tell them: Look, this kind of action
could have consequences; that perhaps
we don’t share as much information
with them as we otherwise would, or it
could mean that certain facilities we
were going to build together won’t be
built but all because of our concern
over Huawei and ZTE.
I want to thank my colleagues, Sen-
ators COONS, MARKEY, CRUZ, and RUBIO,
who have joined me in cosponsoring
this resolution.
I want to thank Chairman RISCH and
Ranking Member CARDIN for working
with my office to get this resolution
condemning and making a very strong
statement against the actions of
Huawei and ZTE back in July.
Again, Huawei and ZTE pose a seri-
ous threat to the United States and our
allies around the globe. This resolution
makes clear many of the longstanding
and bipartisan efforts we have made to-
gether to warn about the threats these
companies pose to our critical tele-
communications infrastructure. It fur-
ther makes clear that the United
States should reiterate to countries
choosing to incorporate Huawei or ZTE
into their new telecommunications in-
frastructure that the United State will
seek to limit the risks posed to our
government and military from use of
such compromised networks.
This is an issue that shouldn’t be
bound by partisanship; it ought to cut
across the Members of this Chamber
who agree on condemning the actions
of Huawei and ZTE and standing up for
our national security. That is why I
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 136, S. Con. Res.
10. I further ask that the committee-re-
ported substitute amendment be agreed
to; the concurrent resolution, as
amended, be agreed to; the Gardner
amendment at the desk to the pre-
amble be considered and agreed to; the
committee-reported amendment to the
preamble, as amended, be agreed to;
the preamble, as amended, be agreed
to; and the motions to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the
table with no intervening action or de-
bate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President,
Huawei presents a very real threat to
the security of every American, both
individually and collectively. I have
long been concerned that the Trump
administration was going to let Huawei
off the hook in order to get a politi-
cally useful trade deal. As the ranking
Democrat on the Senate Finance Com-
mittee, which has jurisdiction over
trade matters, that concerns me great-
ly. In addition, I am concerned that the
resolution being offered does not go far
enough to protect America’s national
security and hold the Trump adminis-
tration accountable.
Tomorrow there will be another bi-
partisan measure offered that, in my
view, will better address the concerns I
have just mentioned, and therefore I
must object this afternoon.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Colorado.
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President,
tomorrow I plan to vote for the motion
to instruct, which is in regard to lan-
guage within the Defense Authoriza-
tion Act that talks about the impor-
tance of protecting our national secu-
rity interests against Huawei and ZTE.
But when we are objecting to resolu-
tions that are bipartisan because of
motions to instruct that have no bind-

Chamber.
So I hope, as I come back to this
floor again to consider S. Con. Res. 10,
to warn our allies that if they use
Huawei or ZTE, there will be repercus-
sions.
The resolution itself is bipartisan. I
hope we can come together as a Senate
and recognize that motions to instruct
are fine, but actual messages, con-
demnation, and understanding of our
allies that actions will be taken are
important.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
SAUDI ARABIA
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
come to the floor today to discuss the
need to bolster our Nation’s energy se-
curity following the recent attacks on
Saudi Arabian oil.
Having read the classified briefing in
full, I am convinced that Iran is abso-
lutely behind the attacks. Now, Iran
wants to drive up world oil prices to
hopefully, in their mind, increase the
amount of revenue they would get from
selling their oil. Basically, they need
the money, and that is because the
sanctions that the United States has
imposed on Iran have worked. They
have been punishing. That is why
President Trump, I believe, made the
right call in adding even tougher sanc-
tions. The sanctions have been biting,
and Iran’s currency has been signifi-
cantly devalued. Now is the time to
step up our own American energy pro-
duction.
Since my Senate arrival in 2007, I
have worked to advance pro-growth en-
ergy policies throughout that entire
time. My goal has always been to pro-
mote American energy, to safeguard
U.S. workers, and to protect this great
Nation.
Today, the United States is the
world’s top energy producer. We are a
global leader in oil, as well as in nat-
ural gas. In fact, the United States is
poised to become the world’s top en-
ergy exporter, as well, and my home
State of Wyoming has been a key driv-
er in all of this success.
To reach this goal, we are going to
need to leverage our energy sources.
This includes zero-emission nuclear
power, as well as renewable energy. We
need it all. In the Senate, I believe
both parties want Americans to use
more carbon-free energy. So both par-
ties should embrace sensible, scientific
solutions. Yet Democrats, once again,
are pushing more of their radical pro-
posals. That is what we have to deal
with.
Two weeks ago, House Democrats
passed several anti-energy bills. These
measures would lock up key offshore
and Alaskan oil reserves. The majority
of House Democrats have cosponsored
these scary schemes that would dam-
age our economy.
If the House Democrats’ anti-energy
bills ever were to become law—and I
assure you that the Republican Senate
and President Trump will never allow
that to happen—they would be a real
gift to our foreign enemies and to our
adversaries, like Russia, because Rus-
sia routinely uses natural gas as a geo-
political weapon.
Still, 2020 Presidential candidate
ELIZABETH WARREN, a Member of our
Senate, recently unveiled a plan to ban
hydraulic fracturing. This revolu-
tionary technique has led to a renais-
sance for American energy production,
and she wants to ban it.
Last year, Senator WARREN’s home
State of Massachusetts imported Rus-
sian natural gas. Where did they im-
port it from? People all across the
country and the world saw the Russian
natural gas tanker in Boston Harbor.
Let me repeat. Let me be very clear.
Last year, Senator WARREN’s home
State of Massachusetts imported Rus-
sian natural gas through the Boston
Harbor. At the same time, the Senator
has denounced U.S. pipelines and other
U.S. energy infrastructure projects—
this, as her own State pays one of high-
est utility rates anywhere in the coun-
try.
Not only do the Democrats’ politi-
cized policies dramatically increase
Americans’ energy costs, but they are
also a threat to our national security.
No matter, Senator WARREN also wants
to ban nuclear power. She doesn’t like
fracking. She doesn’t like natural gas.
She now wants to ban nuclear power.
Has she forgotten that nuclear energy
is America’s chief carbon-free power
source? Twenty percent of U.S. elec-
tricity comes from nuclear power.
These reckless Democrat proposals
would make the United States more de-
pendent on unstable foreign energy
markets.
Working families here in the United
States should never overpay on their
energy bills due to foolish policies—
and that is what they are, foolish poli-
cies that make us all vulnerable. The
American public is not going to stand
for it.
According to a recent Washington
Post-Kaiser Foundation poll, more
than 70 percent of Americans have said
they don’t want to pay even $10 more
on their monthly electric bills to lower
carbon emissions. We want to lower
carbon emissions. How much are fami-
lies willing to pay? Seventy percent
say not $10 a month. How about $2 a
month? A majority said, no, that is too
much to pay.
So we need to pursue a commonsense
energy strategy—one that keeps work-
ing families’ costs down, one that
keeps the economy strong, and one
that helps keep our Nation safe.
Republicans are committed to pro-
tecting and advancing America’s en-
ergy independence. President Trump
understands how important this is. In
the wake of the attacks on Saudi Ara-
bia, not only is the President working
to expand sanctions, but he is moving
to approve major pipeline projects as
well.
One of the energy issues I am ad-
dressing now in the Senate is reform-
ing the permit process for American
energy exploration. Earlier this Con-
gress, I introduced a piece of legisla-
tion called the ONSHORE Act. It
stands for Opportunities for the Nation
and States to Harness Onshore Re-
sources for Energy. The ONSHORE Act
will simplify the process for Federal
onshore oil and gas permits. Whether
we are talking about promoting energy
exploration, utilities, carbon cap-
turing, or nuclear power, we must engi-
neer our way to American energy solu-
tions.
Republicans recognize our Nation’s
unique ability to fill in the gaps from
global supply disruptions. So our focus
needs to be on promoting American en-
ergy independence. It is time to reject
the Democrats’ extreme schemes once
and for all. What the Democrats are
proposing is a real threat to our U.S.
energy security, and they are offering a
gift to American enemies.
We need to continue our America-
first energy policy. That is what we are
going to continue to do to keep us
strong, to keep us safe, and to keep us
prosperous as a nation.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f
EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE
SENATE THAT THE WHISTLE-
BLOWER COMPLAINT RECEIVED
ON AUGUST 12, 2019, BY THE IN-
SPECTOR GENERAL OF THE IN-
TELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
SHOULD BE TRANSMITTED IM-
MEDIATELY TO THE SELECT
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
OF THE SENATE AND THE PER-
MANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE OF THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in
August a public servant inside the in-
telligence community found the con-
duct of the President of the United
States alarming enough to file an offi-
cial whistleblower complaint. The in-
spector general of the intelligence
community found this whistleblower
complaint both credible and urgent. By
law, the Director of National Intel-
ligence must forward such a complaint
to the congressional intelligence com-
mittees within 7 days of receiving it.
Congress has been informed by the in-
spector general of the intelligence
community in writing that the Trump
administration is preventing that com-
plaint from being sent to the relevant
committees in Congress.
Those are the facts. The situation
they describe is unacceptable. We know
that the executive branch is blocking
the legislative branch—a coequal
branch of our government—from per-
forming its constitutional oversight
duties. The fact that the whistleblower
complaint concerns our national secu-
rity, our foreign policy, and potential
misconduct by the President makes the
situation even more serious.
In a short time, I will ask my col-
leagues’ consent to pass a simple reso-
lution. It essentially says ‘‘that the
whistleblower complaint received on
August 12, 2019, by the Inspector Gen-
eral of the Intelligence Community
shall be transmitted immediately to
the Select Committee on Intelligence
of the Senate and the Permanent Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence of the
House of Representatives.’’
I cannot imagine any legitimate or
straight-faced reason for an objection
to this unanimous consent request. The
only reason for any Senator to object
would be to shield the President’s con-
duct from scrutiny by the public and
the representatives they elect to rep-
resent them; that is, to protect the
President from accountability.
In a moment, I hope this resolution
will pass without a single dissenting
Senator, and it should.
The request, despite its non-
controversial nature, speaks to the
issues that go back to the founding
days of our Republic: checks and bal-
ances, the separation of powers, and
the constitutional duty of the Presi-
dent and the executive branch to faith-
fully execute the laws of the United
States. The Senate, today—right now—
should speak with one unified voice to
reaffirm those time-honored principles
and defend the grand traditions of our
democracy.
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the
Senate proceed to the consideration of
S. Res. 325, submitted earlier today.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the resolution by
title.
The legislative clerk read as follows:
A resolution (S. Res. 325) expressing the
sense of the Senate that the whistleblower
complaint received on August 12, 2019, by the
Inspector General of the Intelligence Com-
munity should be transmitted immediately
to the Select Committee on Intelligence of
the Senate and the Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded to consider the resolution.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
reserving the right to object, all of us
share the concern for protecting whis-
tleblowers who use appropriate, estab-
lished channels to raise legitimate con-
cerns. The Senate’s obligation is to
treat such allegations in a responsible
and deliberate manner, to avoid racing
to judgment based on media leaks, and
to not fuel media speculation with
reckless accusations.
There is much we do not know about
the complaint lodged with the intel-
ligence community’s inspector general,
including whether the complaint in-
volves intelligence activities at all.
Before the Democratic leader elected
to go to the media yesterday, the
chairman and vice chair of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence had
already been working together in a bi-
partisan manner—free from
politicization—to get more informa-
tion from both the Acting Director of
National Intelligence and the intel-
ligence community’s inspector general.
Given the progress the committee was
making, I don’t believe this made-for-
TV moment was actually necessary. I
would have preferred the committee be
allowed to do its work in a quiet and
methodical manner. It doesn’t serve
the committee or its goals to litigate
its business here on the floor or for the
television cameras.
Nevertheless, I agree that the DNI
should make additional information
available to the committee so it can
evaluate the complaint consistent with
the statute and other procedures that
exist to safeguard classified and sen-
sitive information.
I also want to express my apprecia-
tion for President Trump’s announce-
ment that the White House will release
tomorrow the ‘‘complete, fully-declas-
sified, and unredacted transcript of
[his] phone conversation with Presi-
dent Zelensky.’’ I hope this will help to
refocus the conversation away from
reckless speculation and back toward
the facts.
So, stipulating that our objective
here is simply to conduct the kind of
bipartisan oversight of intelligence
matters that the committee has suc-
cessfully conducted in the past, I have
no objection to the Senator’s request.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
three brief points. First, this resolu-
tion is not aimed at the Senate Intel-
ligence Committees. Senators BURR
and WARNER do a diligent job in trying
to figure out what is going on. It is
aimed at a thus far recalcitrant execu-
tive branch which has blocked the abil-
ity for the committees to see the com-
plaint even though law requires it.
Second, it is welcomed that we can
join together to do our job of oversight.
I want to thank the majority leader for
not blocking this request, because I
think every one of us in this Chamber
realizes the importance of oversight
and the need to prevent an over-
reaching executive from going that far.
Getting the transcript is a good step,
but it is the complaint we need.
That is the gravamen of this resolu-
tion. It is the whistleblower’s com-
plaint, not the transcript, that we need
and are asking for in this resolution.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent that the resolution be agreed
to and the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table
with no intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The resolution (S. Res. 325) was
agreed to.
(The resolution is printed in today’s
RECORD under ‘‘Submitted Resolu-
tions.’’)

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

The senior assistant bill clerk read
the nomination of Daniel Habib
Jorjani, of Kentucky, to be Solicitor of
the Department of the Interior.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
want to address a matter relating to
the nomination of Daniel Jorjani to be
Solicitor at the Department of Inte-
rior. In March, I joined a bipartisan, bi-
cameral letter to Interior raising con-
cerns about proposed updates to its
Freedom of Information Act, FOIA,
regulations. These changes appeared to
shift the burden of identifying the loca-
tion of agency hold records from the
agency to the public, set limits on re-
quests when they involve processing a
‘‘vast quantity of material,’’ and im-
posed a monthly limit on the proc-
essing of records for a given re-
quester—all of which have no identifi-
able basis in the FOIA statute. Since
then, reports indicated other con-
cerning FOIA policies at Interior that
could result in unlawful delays of FOIA
responses—policies that were in place
while Mr. Jorjani served as Deputy So-
licitor, with key FOIA responsibilities.
Over the weekend, Interior’s inspector
general confirmed an investigation
into the FOIA process at Interior. I
look forward to reading the results of
this investigation and learning more
about the development of these poli-
cies. If confirmed as Solicitor at Inte-
rior, Mr. Jorjani would oversee and re-
solve FOIA appeals, among other criti-
cally important transparency policies.
As we have seen in successive adminis-
trations, FOIA requests are often
viewed as the skunk at the picnic. But
the government’s business is the peo-
ple’s business. Going forward, Mr.
Jorjani would do well to consult with
Congress on any FOIA policy matters
at Interior to ensure compliance with
the law. I intend to vote for Mr.
Jorjani today, but let me be clear: I
will be holding him—and any others
under any administration—accountable
to faithful compliance with both the
letter and spirit of FOIA.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
question is, Will the Senate advise and
consent to the Jorjani nomination?

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the next nomination.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read the nomination of David Fabian
Black, of North Dakota, to be Deputy
Commissioner of Social Security for a
term expiring January 19, 2025 (Re-
appointment).
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
oppose the nomination of David Black
to be Deputy Commissioner of Social
Security. I have longstanding concerns
about how management at the Social
Security Administration has treated
the unions representing their work-
force, and I am concerned about the
role that Mr. Black may have played in
these anti-union practices.
SSA was especially hostile towards
its workers when it implemented the
anti-union Executive orders that Presi-
dent Trump issued on May 25, 2018. SSA
was one of the few agencies to evict
unions from office space pursuant to
the Executive orders, in the brief time
before a Federal district court issued
an injunction blocking key parts of the
Executive orders. SSA also abrogated
its unexpired contract with adminis-
trative law judges who are represented
by the International Federation of Pro-
fessional and Technical Engineers,
which even the Executive orders them-
selves expressly prohibited.
After the Executive orders were
blocked in court, SSA went to the Fed-
eral Service Impasses Panel to impose
a contract on workers represented by
the American Federation of Govern-
ment Employees, and the terms of this
contract were highly similar to provi-
sions of the Executive orders. SSA is
now using similar tactics against
workers represented by National Treas-
ury Employees Union.
We need to stop a bad situation from
getting worse. The Senate should de-
mand stronger commitments to im-
prove labor relations from President
Trump’s nominees for leadership posi-
tions at SSA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5651
September 24, 2019
When SSA took these anti-union ac-
tions, Mr. Black was the White House
senior adviser at the Social Security
Administration. Despite Mr. Black’s
responsibility for SSA, he claimed in a
letter to me that, ‘‘I was not involved
in SSA’s implementation of the EOs.’’
It is my understanding, however,
that there is a pending Freedom of In-
formation Act request that may shed
new light on Mr. Black’s involvement
with the Executive orders. SSA has
stated that an email records search
generated thousands of emails that
need to be reviewed for pertinence and
disclosure in response to the request,
and that review is still ongoing. I cer-
tainly hope that SSA’s response will
confirm Mr. Black’s statement that he
was not involved with the Executive
orders, but the Senate should wait
until all the facts are in before moving
forward with his confirmation.
For those reasons, I will oppose Mr.
Black’s nomination at this time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
question is, Will the Senate advise and
consent to the Black nomination?

PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on Sun-
day I had the great honor of joining
President Trump in welcoming Prime
Minister Modi to the Lone Star State
in an event that was appropriately
named ‘‘Howdy, Modi.’’
When his trip was announced, people
on the west coast and the east coast
wondered, ‘‘Why Texas?’’ They
thought, maybe, he would go to Silicon
Valley to talk to Big Tech executives
or spend some time in Washington hob-
nobbing with diplomats and legislative
leaders. Those are great places to visit,
but Houston is the energy capital of
the world. It is providing literal fuel
for our growing relationship with the
Nation of India.
After nearly a four-decade ban on
U.S. crude oil exports was lifted, Texas
sent the first American crude oil to
India, and today India is increasingly
running on American natural gas. The
reason that is important is, when I vis-
ited India for the first time in 2004, I
witnessed a country that is a study in
contrast—some highly populated areas
like Delhi and others, and then rural
areas on the way to the Taj Mahal in
Agra, you can see people literally liv-
ing off the land and using dried cow
manure as fuel for their food and for
warmth. Obviously, India needs access
to affordable energy that America—and
Texas, in particular—can provide to
help improve their standard of living.
This trade is also vital to our econ-
omy in Texas, and we will keep export-
ing our greatest natural resource to
our friends in India and around the
world as a result of the energy renais-
sance we have seen and as a result of
the use of unconventional extraction
techniques like fracking and horizontal
drilling.
Those must sound like foreign words
to people in Washington, DC, who
think we ought to be able to live on
solar panels and windmills exclusively,
but I always say, as important as re-
newable energy is—and it is impor-
tant—Texas generates the most elec-
tricity for any State in the Nation
from wind turbines. The wind doesn’t
always blow and the Sun doesn’t al-
ways shine, and you need some sort of
baseload to try to keep the electricity
flowing so people can be afforded the
comforts of life and particularly in hot
Texas summers make sure the air-con-
ditioner continues to work.
For as deep as our economic ties are,
our cultural ties are just as strong.
Texas is home to a vibrant Indian dias-
pora, with more than 150,000 Indian
Americans living in the Houston area
alone and perhaps about half a million
across our entire State. I was glad the
Prime Minister had a chance to witness
the Indian culture that is woven into
the fabric of our State and meet a
number of proud Indian Americans, in-
cluding the 50,000 who showed up for
the ‘‘Howdy, Modi’’ events in Houston
on Sunday, from 48 States, I am told.
Knowing the importance of a strong
U.S.-India relationship, 15 years ago I
cofounded the U.S.-India Caucus in the
Senate. That was at the request of one
of my constituents who founded one of
the Indo-American Chambers in the
metroplex in Dallas, TX, years ago. He
is the one who encouraged my wife and
I to travel to India in the first place,
where I learned a lot about the coun-
try—the study in contrasts I men-
tioned but also that this is the world’s
largest democracy, and we shared so
many values with that country because
of our common English heritage and
particularly our respect for the rule of
law and use of the English language
predominantly.
We also saw the advantage of collabo-
rating with India economically—1.3 bil-
lion people—a great market for the
things we make and grow in the United
States and a great way to raise the
standard of living in India as we deepen
our ties militarily and from a national
security standpoint. The difference be-
tween today and what things were like
as recently as 2008, in terms of trade, is
just like night and day.
In 2016, the United States designated
India as a ‘‘major defense partner,’’
with the goal of elevating our partner-
ship with India to the same level as
those of our other closest allies.
Since then, we have taken a number
of steps to strengthen our defense rela-
tionship, such as establishing ministe-
rial dialogue, increasing arms sales to
India, and the first U.S.-India
triservice exercise later this year. We
have made real progress, but there is
more we can do to ensure that our ef-
forts are aligned, just as our interests
are aligned. Particularly as China is on
the march, having a strong and vibrant
economy and a strong defense partner
in India is more important than ever.
Earlier this year, I also introduced
an amendment to the National Defense

Authorization Act, which requires the
Secretary of Defense to submit a report
on U.S.-India defense cooperation in
the Western Indian Ocean within 180
days of enactment.
It will allow us to get a clearer pic-
ture of current military activities and
will enable the Secretary of Defense to
enter into military cooperation agree-
ments and conduct regular joint mili-
tary training and operations with India
in the Western Indian Ocean. This
would be a major step to bolster our re-
lationship and strengthen our defense
cooperation.
I am hopeful this provision will ulti-
mately be included in the Defense au-
thorization bill that is now going

am optimistic we will be able to get
the President’s signature and see this

TROPICAL STORM IMELDA
Madam President, briefly, on one
other matter, Tropical Storm Imelda
made landfall in Southeast Texas last
week and dumped massive amounts of
rain all across the region.
It is just 2 years after Hurricane Har-
vey, which is a more familiar name to
people up here in DC, but the scenes
are heartbreakingly similar. It wasn’t
the high winds so much as it was the
incredible amount of water that was
dumped into the Houston area and the
surrounding counties. Neighborhood
streets began to look more like rivers
than roads. Folks were wading in the
water, carrying children on their
shoulders, and personal belongings
washed away with raging floodwaters.
We have learned before, and we were
reminded again, that these storms
aren’t only disruptive; they are incred-
ibly dangerous. Five people have died
as a result of the storm, and hundreds
more remain displaced.
Imelda was the fifth wettest tropical
cyclone in the continental United
States, with some areas receiving more
than 31⁄2 feet of rain in a very short pe-
riod of time. But as we have learned be-
fore, these trying times seem to some-
how bring out the best in people.
A group of residents in the small
community of Cheek, TX, waded
through chest-high water to rescue
nine horses. Furniture store owner Jim
McIngvale, known to all of us as ‘‘Mat-
tress Mack,’’ once again opened up his
stores as a shelter for victims. His em-
ployees were running rescue oper-
ations, taking furniture trucks out to
pick up those who had been stranded
by high water. There was even a 21-
year-old college student who worked
all night alone at a Beaumont hotel for
32 hours straight. Not only did he sin-
glehandedly manage a hotel, he and
other guests ventured out into the
flood to help distribute food and water
to truckers stranded in their trucks.
I am grateful to the countless people
who have helped their neighbors in big
and small ways alike and who will no
doubt continue supporting their com-
munities in the months ahead.
For many Texans, this is the second
time in 2 years they have had to re-
cover from extraordinary flooding. The
storm completely devastated commu-
nities throughout the southeast part of
my State, and folks are just now begin-
ning what will undoubtedly be a major
cleanup effort.
With waters receding, local officials
are now taking stock of the damage
and moving from response to recovery.
These rain events—these huge floods—
are often more than any one city or
one county can manage alone. It is an
all-hands-on-deck moment that brings
together local, State, and Federal offi-
cials, as well as nongovernmental orga-
nizations.
Governor Abbott declared a state of
disaster in several counties to ensure
State resources are available to local
government agencies.
Last week, I spoke to many of the
county judges who have jurisdiction
over much of these flooded areas, the
hardest hit areas, and I offered my sup-
port. I want to assure everyone who
has been impacted by the storm that
they are not alone and that we are
committed to working together as
State, local, and Federal officials to
ensure that they have what they need
to recover from this devastating Trop-
ical Storm Imelda.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to express to the Senator
from Texas our concern and our
thoughts for all of those who have been
so impacted.
DIGITAL RESPONSIBILITY
Madam President, the Senator from
Texas mentioned the floods and the im-
pact that had happened. I found out
about some of the good work of the
Good Samaritans in the area by watch-
ing what was taking place on social
media, and I am certain millions of
Americans saw firsthand some of the
generosity and the help that was given
there.
Indeed, the internet and social media
platforms have transformed the way we
communicate, the way we send out in-
formation, and many times the way we
receive it. Correspondence that, just a
few years ago, would have taken pen,
paper, and postage is now sent and re-
ceived with a simple click of a mouse.
Everything happens online, from
communicating about disasters to
shopping to party planning and to cam-
paigning. We share photos and mile-
stones with our ‘‘friends.’’ We let peo-
ple know that we are OK in times of
disasters or that we need help. We
share all of this not only with our
friends, but we are also sharing it with
companies that have built multibil-
lion-dollar empires based on their abil-
ity to convince us to surrender just one
more little piece of unique data about
us or about our families.
Beyond social media, we live our ev-
eryday transactional lives online also.
We bank via apps. We sign up for credit
cards using codes we have received in
an email and manage our finances with
cloud-based software. Information we
once would have locked securely in a
desk drawer, we now plug into an on-
line forum without ever giving it a sec-
ond thought.
We have contributed to our own, as I
call it, ‘‘virtual you’’; that is, our per-
sonal online footprint unique to us,
unique only to us. We have done this
by trusting these platforms to keep our
data secure. In a way, this level of
connectivity and trust has made life a
lot easier and more convenient, but it
has also made us vulnerable to exploi-
tation and exposure.
I have spoken before about con-
sumers’ justifiable expectation of a
right to privacy online. This year, I in-
troduced the BROWSER Act, which I
had previously introduced when I was
in the House. It is an effort to codify
this right to privacy that consumers
expect. BROWSER gives Big Tech basic
guidelines to follow when collecting
and selling user data, and that user is
you.
It has become understood that you
are the product when you are using
these social media apps and experi-
encing this connectivity. You are the
product. You have the right to know
that you are that product, and you
have the right to decide what is shared
about your life. But protecting an indi-
vidual’s data is only part of this pic-
ture.
Last week, the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Technology
held a hearing to address the role that
digital services play in the distribution
of violent and extremist content. We
welcomed testimony from Facebook,
Twitter, and Google, detailing what
they are doing to remove extremist
content on platforms.
I will tell you, before we talk about
policing content, we, as Members of
this body, need to make sure we under-
stand how the American people view
their use of social media and the inter-
net.
Whether social media platforms
should be regulated under the First
Amendment is beside the point. Ameri-
cans view these services as open public
forums, where they can speak their
minds on everything from defense fund-
ing to the Emmy Awards. These con-
sumers don’t want the Wild West, nor
do they want to be censored based on a
content reviewer’s subjective opinion.
What they want is an objective cop on
the beat—just as in the public square,
an objective cop on the beat who is
equipped to properly identify incite-
ment, threats, and other types of
speech that could put lives at risk.
This, of course, is easier said than
done. In the case of Facebook, for ex-
ample, that translates to creating a set
of standards that 30,000 in-house engi-
neers and analysts and 15,000 content
reviewers will be able to apply—45,000
people, and that is just one platform.
There is a reason that time and again
Big Tech executives look at Congress

and say ‘‘Oh, more regulatory control
over the way we do business,’’ and it is
this: Policing legitimately dangerous
content is a big job, and policing
‘‘awful but lawful’’ content as
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg likes
to call it, is an even bigger, more
daunting task.
It takes 45,000 people to do a bare-
minimum job for one company. Imag-
ine trying to create easy-to-under-
stand, bright-line standards that 45,000
employees will be able to digest and
apply quickly enough to keep up with
the flow of content. That has to be an
intimidating task.
I will tell you, if those executives
think the government could do a better
job of deciding down to the letter what
those standards should be, I think they
are mistaken. Only the engineers and
innovators know their companies well
enough to set their own internal poli-
cies for acceptable uses of their plat-
form, but that is not to say that I will
not be taking an interest in their ideas.
We need to have a Federal standard
of privacy and data security. We need
to review censorship and prioritization,
competition, and antitrust.
For example, Facebook is in the
process of putting together a content
oversight board to adjudicate users
whose posts have been deemed in viola-
tion and taken down. They have
pledged to make the identities of the
moderators and their decisions public—
barring any safety risks—and to choose
a diverse panel. The biggest unan-
swered questions here are these: Will
the moderators really reflect the
American political spectrum? How will
they be chosen? The American people
will demand more than a promise to be
fair and impartial.
As I said, government cannot make
these decisions in total for Big Tech,
but we can help guide them along the
way by passing privacy and data secu-
rity standards. This is where working
groups like the Judiciary Committee’s
Tech Task Force come into play.
Last week, I was speaking to a group
of private sector tech gurus, and I told
them that the only way we will be able
to move forward is if the government
does more listening and they do more
talking and work with us on setting
these basic standards.
I stand by what I said. It is not—and
should not be—Congress’s job to decide
in retrospect what sort of culture com-
panies like Facebook and Twitter
meant to create. It is imperative that
these companies understand the Amer-
ican public views them as a public
square, an online public square, and it
is up to them to be certain that there
is an objective cop on the beat.
I yield the floor.

DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. UDALL. Madam President,
thank you for the recognition.
The Constitution demands that ‘‘No
Money shall be drawn from the Treas-
ury but in Consequence of Appropria-
tions made by Law.’’
Like any other matter, it is
Congress’s power and responsibility to
determine how much taxpayer money
is spent on the President’s request for
a border wall.
Like most Presidents, he didn’t get
every dollar he wanted. Now the Presi-
dent, through a sham national emer-
gency declaration, is taking $3.6 billion
of funds we appropriated for military
construction projects to pay for his
wall. The real question is not whether
the President is usurping our article I
power to appropriate; he is, no doubt
about it. The real question is, Will we
do something about it?
Today I urge all my colleagues to
vote in favor of our resolution termi-
nating the President’s national emer-
gency declaration.
Madam President, starting off the de-
bate, I ask unanimous consent to have
printed in the RECORD the following
materials: a joint declaration from
former national security officials out-
lining why the President’s border
emergency does not qualify under the
National Emergencies Act and a Sep-
tember 18, 2019, Washington Post arti-
cle outlining the dire outcomes warned
by the Pentagon if the military con-
struction projects don’t go forward.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

2. On February 15, 2019, the President de-
clared a ‘‘national emergency’’ for the pur-
pose of diverting appropriated funds from
previously designated uses to build a wall
along the southern border. We are aware of
no emergency that remotely justifies such a
step. The President’s actions are at odds
with the overwhelming evidence in the pub-
lic record, including the administration’s
own data and estimates. We have lived and
worked through national emergencies, and
we support the President’s power to mobilize
the Executive Branch to respond quickly in
genuine national emergencies. But under no
plausible assessment of the evidence is there
a national emergency today that entitles the
President to tap into funds appropriated for
other purposes to build a wall at the south-
ern border. To our knowledge, the Presi-
dent’s assertion of a national emergency
here is unprecedented, in that he seeks to ad-
dress a situation: (1) that has been enduring,
rather than one that has arisen suddenly; (2)
that in fact has improved over time rather
than deteriorated; (3) by reprogramming bil-
lions of dollars in funds in the face of clear
congressional intent to the contrary; and (4)
with assertions that are rebutted not just by
the public record, but by his agencies’ own
official data, documents, and statements.
3. Illegal border crossings are near forty-
year lows. At the outset, there is no evidence
of a sudden or emergency increase in the
number of people seeking to cross the south-
ern border. According to the administra-
tion’s own data, the numbers of apprehen-
sions and undetected illegal border crossings
at the southern border are near forty-year
lows. Although there was a modest increase
in apprehensions in 2018, that figure is in
keeping with the number of apprehensions
only two years earlier, and the overall trend
indicates a dramatic decline over the last fif-
teen years in particular. The administration
also estimates that ‘‘undetected unlawful en-
tries’’ at the southern border ‘‘fell from ap-
proximately 851,000 to nearly 62,000’’ between
fiscal years 2006 to 2016, the most recent
years for which data are available. The
United States currently hosts what is esti-
mated to be the smallest number of undocu-
mented immigrants since 2004. And in fact,
in recent years, the majority of currently
undocumented immigrants entered the
United States legally, but overstayed their
visas, a problem that will not be addressed
by the declaration of an emergency along the
southern border.
4. There is no documented terrorist or na-
tional security emergency at the southern
border. There is no reason to believe that
there is a terrorist or national security
emergency at the southern border that could
justify the President’s proclamation.
a. This administration’s own most recent
Country Report on Terrorism, released only
five months ago, found that ‘‘there was no
credible evidence indicating that inter-
national terrorist groups have established
bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug
cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into
the United States.’’ Since 1975, there has
been only one reported incident in which im-
migrants who had crossed the southern bor-
der illegally attempted to commit a terrorist
act. That incident occurred more than
twelve years ago, and involved three broth-
ers from Macedonia who had been brought
into the United States as children more than
twenty years earlier.
b. Although the White House has claimed,
as an argument favoring a wall at the south-
ern border, that almost 4,000 known or sus-
pected terrorists were intercepted at the
southern border in a single year, this asser-
tion has since been widely and consistently
repudiated, including by this administra-
tion’s own Department of Homeland Secu-
rity. The overwhelming majority of individ-
uals on terrorism watchlists who were inter-
cepted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol
were attempting to travel to the United
States by air; of the individuals on the ter-
rorist watchlist who were encountered while
entering the United States during fiscal year
2017, only 13 percent traveled by land. And
for those who have attempted to enter by
land, only a small fraction do so at the
southern border. Between October 2017 and
March 2018, forty-one foreign immigrants on
the terrorist watchlist were intercepted at
the northern border. Only six such immi-
grants were intercepted at the southern bor-
der.
5. There is no emergency related to violent
crime at the southern border. Nor can the
administration justify its actions on the
grounds that the incidence of violent crime
on the southern border constitutes a na-
tional emergency. Factual evidence consist-
ently shows that unauthorized immigrants
have no special proclivity to engage in
criminal or violent behavior. According to a
Cato Institute analysis of criminological
data, undocumented immigrants are 44 per-
cent less likely to be incarcerated nation-
wide than are native-born citizens. And in
Texas, undocumented immigrants were
found to have a first-time conviction rate 32
percent below that of native-born Ameri-
cans; the conviction rates of unauthorized
immigrants for violent crimes such as homi-
cide and sex offenses were also below those of
native-born Americans. Meanwhile, overall
rates of violent crime in the United States
have declined significantly over the past 25
years, falling 49 percent from 1993 to 2017.
And violent crime rates in the country’s 30
largest cities have decreased on average by
2.7 percent in 2018 alone, further under-
mining any suggestion that recent crime
trends currently warrant the declaration of a
national emergency.
6. There is no human or drug trafficking
emergency that can be addressed by a wall at
the southern border. The administration has
claimed that the presence of human and drug
trafficking at the border justifies its emer-
gency declaration. But there is no evidence
of any such sudden crisis at the southern
border that necessitates a reprogramming of
appropriations to build a border wall.
a. The overwhelming majority of opioids
that enter the United States across a land
border are carried through legal ports of
entry in personal or commercial vehicles,
not smuggled through unauthorized border
crossings. A border wall would not stop these
drugs from entering the United States. Nor
would a wall stop drugs from entering via
other routes, including smuggling tunnels,
which circumvent such physical barriers as
fences and walls, and international mail
(which is how high-purity fentanyl, for ex-
ample, is usually shipped from China di-
rectly to the United States).
b. Likewise, illegal crossings at the south-
ern border are not the principal source of
human trafficking victims. About two-thirds
of human trafficking victims served by non-
profit organizations that receive funding
from the relevant Department of Justice of-
fice are U.S. citizens, and even among non-
citizens, most trafficking victims usually ar-
rive in the country on valid visas. None of
these instances of trafficking could be ad-
dressed by a border wall. And the three
states with the highest per capita trafficking
reporting rates are not even located along
the southern border.
7. This proclamation will only exacerbate
the humanitarian concerns that do exist at
the southern border. There are real humani-
tarian concerns at the border, but they
largely result from the current administra-
tion’s own deliberate policies towards mi-
grants. For example, the administration has
used a ‘‘metering’’ policy to turn away fami-
lies fleeing extreme violence and persecution
in their home countries, forcing them to
wait indefinitely at the border to present
their asylum cases, and has adopted a num-
ber of other punitive steps to restrict those
seeking asylum at the southern border.
These actions have forced asylum-seekers to
live on the streets or in makeshift shelters
and tent cities with abysmal living condi-
tions, and limited access to basic sanitation
has caused outbreaks of disease and death.
This state of affairs is a consequence of
choices this administration has made, and
erecting a wall will do nothing to ease the
suffering of these people.
8. Redirecting funds for the claimed ‘‘na-
tional emergency’’ will undermine U.S. na-
tional security and foreign policy interests.
In the face of a nonexistent threat, re-
directing funds for the construction of a wall
along the southern border will undermine
national security by needlessly pulling re-
sources from Department of Defense pro-
grams that are responsible for keeping our
troops and our country safe and running ef-
fectively.
a. Repurposing funds from the defense con-
struction budget will drain money from crit-
ical defense infrastructure projects, possibly
including improvement of military hospitals,
construction of roads, and renovation of on-
base housing. And the proclamation will
likely continue to divert those armed forces
already deployed at the southern border
from their usual training activities or mis-
sions, affecting troop readiness.
b. In addition, the administration’s unilat-
eral, provocative actions are heightening
tensions with our neighbors to the south, at
a moment when we need their help to ad-
dress a range of Western Hemisphere con-
cerns. These actions are placing friendly
governments to the south under impossible
pressures and driving partners away. They
have especially strained our diplomatic rela-
tionship with Mexico, a relationship that is
vital to regional efforts ranging from critical
intelligence and law enforcement partner-
ships to cooperative efforts to address the
growing tensions with Venezuela. Addition-
ally, the proclamation could well lead to the
degradation of the natural environment in a
manner that could only contribute to long-
term socioeconomic and security challenges.
c. Finally, by declaring a national emer-
gency for domestic political reasons with no
compelling reason or justification from his
senior intelligence and law enforcement offi-
cials, the President has further eroded his
credibility with foreign leaders, both friend
and foe. Should a genuine foreign crisis
erupt, this lack of credibility will materially
weaken this administration’s ability to mar-
shal allies to support the United States, and
will embolden adversaries to oppose us.
9. The situation at the border does not re-
quire the use of the armed forces, and a wall
is unnecessary to support the use of the
armed forces. We understand that the admin-
istration is also claiming that the situation
at the southern border ‘‘requires use of the
armed forces,’’ and that a wall is ‘‘necessary
to support such use’’ of the armed forces.
These claims are implausible.
a. Historically, our country has deployed
National Guard troops at the border solely
to assist the Border Patrol when there was
an extremely high number of apprehensions,
together with a particularly low number of
Border Patrol agents. But currently, even

with retention and recruitment challenges,
the Border Patrol is at historically high
staffing and funding levels, and apprehen-
sions—measured in both absolute and per-
agent terms—are near historic lows.
b. Furthermore, the composition of south-
ern border crossings has shifted such that
families and unaccompanied minors now ac-
count for the majority of immigrants seek-
ing entry at the southern border; these indi-
viduals do not present a threat that would
need to be countered with military force.
c. Just last month, when asked what the
military is doing at the border that couldn’t
be done by the Department of Homeland Se-
curity if it had the funding for it, a top-level
defense official responded, ‘‘[n]one of the ca-
pabilities that we are providing [at the
southern border] are combat capabilities. It’s
not a war zone along the border.’’ Finally, it
is implausible that hundreds of miles of wall
across the southern border are somehow nec-
essary to support the use of armed forces. We
are aware of no military- or security-related
rationale that could remotely justify such an
endeavor.
10. There is no basis for circumventing the
appropriations process with a declaration of
a national emergency at the southern bor-
der. We do not deny that our nation faces
real immigration and national security chal-
lenges. But as the foregoing demonstrates,
these challenges demand a thoughtful, evi-
dence-based strategy, not a manufactured
crisis that rests on falsehoods and
fearmongering. In a briefing before the Sen-
ate Intelligence Committee on January 29,
2019, less than one month before the Presi-
dential Proclamation, the Directors of the
CIA, DNI, FBI, and NSA testified about nu-
merous serious current threats to U.S. na-
tional security, but none of the officials
identified a security crisis at the U.S.-Mex-
ico border. In a briefing before the House
Armed Services Committee the next day,
Pentagon officials acknowledged that the
2018 National Defense Strategy does not
identify the southern border as a security
threat. Leading legislators with access to
classified information and the President’s
own statements have strongly suggested, if
not confirmed, that there is no evidence sup-
porting the administration’s claims of an
emergency. And it is reported that the Presi-
dent made the decision to circumvent the ap-
propriations process and reprogram money
without the Acting Secretary of Defense
having even started to consider where the
funds might come from, suggesting an ab-
sence of consultation and internal delibera-
tions that in our experience are necessary
and expected before taking a decision of this
magnitude.
11. For all of the foregoing reasons, in our
professional opinion, there is no factual basis
for the declaration of a national emergency
for the purpose of circumventing the appro-
priations process and reprogramming bil-
lions of dollars in funding to construct a wall
at the southern border, as directed by the
Presidential Proclamation of February 15,
2019.

PENTAGON HAS WARNED OF DIRE OUTCOMES IF
MILITARY PROJECTS CANCELED FOR WALL
DON’T HAPPEN
(By Aaron Gregg and Erica Werner)
The Pentagon warned of dire outcomes un-
less Congress paid for urgently needed mili-
tary construction projects nationwide—the
same projects that have now been canceled
to fund President Trump’s border wall.
The warnings are contained in Defense De-
partment budget requests sent to lawmakers
in recent years. They include potentially
hazardous living conditions for troops and
their families, as well as unsafe schools that
would impede learning. In numerous cases,
the Defense Department warned that lives
would be put at risk if buildings don’t meet
the military’s standards for fire safety or
management of explosives.
Even before $3.6 billion in construction
funding was pulled to support a wall along
the U.S.-Mexico border, military buildings
across the country often had been neglected
in favor of other priorities. The defense
spending limits that took effect after a 2013
budget deal designed to end a government
shutdown starved the military’s construc-
tion budget for years, officials and analysts
say, meaning many construction projects are
long overdue.
The details in the budget documents—an-
nual requests the Pentagon sends to Capitol
Hill that are mostly public—underscore the
risky trade-offs Trump made in declaring a
national emergency that allowed him to di-
vert funding for the wall.
A Pentagon spokesman did not imme-
diately respond to a message seeking com-
ment.
In requests to Congress over the past three
years, military officials describe dilapidated
World War II-era warehouses with ‘‘leaking
asbestos panel roof systems,’’ a drone pilot
training facility with sinkholes and a bat in-
festation, explosives being stored in build-
ings that didn’t meet safety standards and a
mold-infested middle school. In numerous in-
stances, Defense Department officials wrote
that the infrastructure problems were hurt-
ing the military’s readiness and impeding
the department’s national security mission.
Democrats and some Republicans strongly
oppose the emergency declaration. The Sen-
ate is expected to vote for a second time in
the coming weeks to overturn it, but Con-
gress does not appear to have enough votes
to overcome Trump’s veto of such a dis-
approval resolution.
A list of the military construction projects
being defunded to pay for the wall was re-
leased in early September. But it did not
contain details of the Pentagon’s expla-
nations to Congress about why the projects
were needed—and what would happen if they
were not completed. The Washington Post’s
review of the budget documents is the first
attempt to detail those Pentagon warnings.
The Post uncovered budget documents per-
taining to 29 of the 43 military construction
projects in the mainland United States—not
including those in territories such as Puerto
Rico and Guam—that are being canceled to
pay for the wall. The review excluded two
projects that had been canceled before the
emergency authorization. Many of these doc-
uments are publicly available but have not
been previously reported.
The Pentagon insists that the projects are
merely being delayed, not canceled, and Re-
publicans say they will try to ‘‘backfill’’ the
money in question, but Democrats oppose
that strategy. In recent days, the fight over
the border wall money has caused angry divi-
sions among lawmakers trying to write an-
nual spending bills to keep the government
running, raising the specter of another shut-
down this year. Last winter’s record-long 35–
day partial government shutdown ended only
after Trump declared a national emergency
because Congress wouldn’t give him all the
money he wanted for his wall. (During his
campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed that
Mexico would pay for the construction.)
Congressional Democrats have rallied
around the issue, decrying unsafe conditions
in their home districts and nationwide.
‘‘We see across the country—communities,
military bases and people in the military—
saying, ‘Taking away this money hurts us,’ ’’
Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.)
said on the Senate floor this week. ‘‘All the
Democrats are asking for is to protect the
troops from having their resources robbed
for a border wall—resources that Congress
said should go to the military.’’
Sen. Tim Kaine (D–Va.) said ‘‘it shocks me
that, as commander in chief, [Trump] now
insists that it’s got to be our troops, our
military families and our nation’s security
that have to be sacrificed for his foolish-
ness,’’ noting that $77 million had been
‘‘raided’’ from projects in his state.
OMINOUS WARNINGS
This month, the Pentagon announced that
127 military construction projects stood to
lose funding to pay for Trump’s wall. Al-
though Pentagon officials have expressed
confidence that the projects ultimately will
go forward, there is no guarantee that they
will.
In many cases, the Pentagon has been omi-
nous in describing the potential outcomes
should the projects not happen.
The Air Force has been seeking a new
training facility for drone pilots at
Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico be-
cause the current training facility had sink-
holes and a bat infestation.
It also prevents pilot trainees from oper-
ating in a classified environment, the Air
Force wrote in its publicly accessible budget
request. This means trainees could not use a
safety system designed to alert drone pilots
to the location of ground-based personnel, as
well as a separate system designed to pre-
vent aircraft from crashing into one another.
The Air Force has been seeking a new con-
trol center at Hill Air Force Base in Utah,
designed to replace a pair of ‘‘dilapidated
WWII-era warehouses’’ used for air traffic
control and mission control operations even
though they have been labeled ‘‘structurally
deficient’’ and don’t meet regulations. The
Air Force noted in its budget request that
air traffic control equipment is at risk of
being destroyed by ‘‘roof leaks from failing
asbestos panel roof systems.’’
If the $28 million project is not finished,
the Air Force warned in 2017, service mem-
bers will continue to operate in ‘‘aging dilap-
idated buildings that were never intended for
the purpose they are now serving.’’
The Air National Guard has been seeking
to replace the aircraft parking ramp at a
New Orleans facility, which abuts a public
roadway. This means munitions-loaded air-
craft—which are kept on alert so they can be
scrambled quickly in the event of a terrorist
attack—expose the public to the ‘‘unaccept-
able risk’’ of being affected by an explosive
accident, the Air Force wrote in 2018. An Air
Force analysis calculated that members of

the public are inside the jets’ ‘‘explosive arc’’
for about 3,800 hours per year as they pass by
the base.
In addition, the shelters that hold the air-
craft when they aren’t parked on the runway
are on concrete slabs that are sinking, caus-
ing pipes and electrical connections to pull
loose. The shelters also did not have fire pro-
tections, the Defense Department wrote in
2018.
The Defense Department also warned that
overly decentralized weapons maintenance
buildings in Anniston, Ala., would continue
to increase the risk of accidents because of
the ‘‘unnecessary movement of artillery
pieces.’’
The Air Force has been seeking $41 million
to repair a central heat power plant boiler at
Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. The Air
Force warned in its budget justification to
Congress that the boiler, installed in 1951, is
expected to fail within the next several years
at a base where winter temperatures can
plunge as low as 65 degrees below zero. That
outcome ‘‘would be devastating to facilities
and the missions housed in those facilities,’’
the Air Force said. The base could be forced
to evacuate, and the facilities would then
freeze and require ‘‘many millions of dol-
lars’’ to make them usable again.
The system in question is one of two 1950s-
era boilers that require urgent replacement
at Eielson. The failure of the other one is de-
scribed as ‘‘imminent’’ and also could force
an evacuation, followed by a deep freeze that
would cost millions of dollars to recover
from, according to the Air Force’s descrip-
tion from 2017.
‘SUBSTANDARD,’ ‘UNSAFE’
A different issue looms at Camp Lejeune,
N.C., where medical and dental care is pro-
vided in ‘‘substandard, inefficient, decentral-
ized and uncontrolled facilities,’’ according
to the military, which has sought congres-
sional approval to build a new ambulatory
care center on the base. Not doing so ‘‘will
result in compromised readiness, uncoordi-
nated care delivery, and inappropriate use of
medical resources,’’ the Pentagon said.
At Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in
South Carolina, the military sought funding
to build a satellite fire station, without
which ‘‘personnel . . . will continue to work
from a significantly undersized and unsafe
facility.’’
In another example, the military is seek-
ing to repair a middle school at Fort Camp-
bell in Kentucky, a project that has been
championed by Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell (R–Ky.) and that he has
vowed to protect even after its appearance
on the list of installations at risk of being
canceled to pay for Trump’s wall.
The Pentagon described conditions at the
middle school as ‘‘substandard’’ and told
lawmakers in requesting $62.6 million to re-
pair it that ‘‘the continued use of deficient,
inadequate, and undersized facilities that do
not accommodate the current student popu-
lation will continue to impair the overall
education program for students.’’
At Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, mean-
while, construction of a much-needed new
child-care center has been put on hold in
favor of Trump’s wall. The Pentagon notes
that the facility ‘‘has suffered from sewage
backups, heating, ventilation and air condi-
tioning failures and mold and pest manage-
ment issues.’’ The upgraded facility is sup-
posed to accommodate 165 children and staff
members. As of February 2018, 115 children
were on a waiting list to get in.
Joint Base Andrews is also home to the
hangar that holds Air Force One. That hang-
ar is being relocated at a cost of $154 million
to accommodate a larger Boeing model now
being used for Trump. But the new hangar
displaces a specialized area designed for un-
loading hazardous cargo and a separate dis-
posal range where Air Force officials could
be trained to defuse bombs. The Air Force re-
quested $37 million for a new hazardous-
cargo pad and explosive-ordnance center, but
that project has been included on the list of
those being canceled to pay for the barrier
along the border. The Air Force One hangar
project was left untouched.
As a result, a temporary facility will be
provided. But not replacing the hazardous-
cargo pad would cause ‘‘enduring systemic
weaknesses’’ at the base, while the lack of an
explosive-ordinance range would ‘‘adversely
impact’’ training, which would have to hap-
pen somewhere off the base at greater cost,
the military said.
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, with
that, I yield to Senator MURRAY.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I
join my Democratic colleagues on the
floor to once again speak out against
this President and his administration’s
outrageous abuses of Executive power.
While, unfortunately, there is a myr-
iad of Presidential abuses to which I
could be referring, today, this evening,
I am here to discuss two of his most re-
cent and most egregious actions that
have not only run afoul of Congress’s
authority and our constitutional sys-
tem of checks and balances but also
compromise our national security.
It began with the President making a
phony national emergency declaration
to bypass Congress and steal money to
build his border wall under the aus-
pices of a ‘‘crisis’’—one of the Presi-
dent’s own making—in pursuit of ad-
vancing the most anti-immigrant agen-
da this country has seen in genera-
tions, all manufactured to secure Fed-
eral funds to build his often-touted
vanity wall on our southern border.
This is a wall the American people
were not supposed to pay for and that
we, time and again, have indicated we
do not want.
Now, one would think this extreme
overreach of Executive authority alone
would get our colleagues on the other
side of the aisle riled up enough to de-
fend the Constitution’s system of
checks and balances, but in declaring
his national emergency, President
Trump took his overreach one step fur-
ther, ransacking critical Federal
funds—taxpayer dollars—that were ap-
propriated by Congress to fund impor-
tant military construction projects and
national security priorities across the
country. To do what with? To put
money toward building his border wall.
To be clear, instead of Federal funds
going toward military infrastructure
priorities such as a new pier and main-
tenance facility at Naval Base Kitsap
in my home State of Washington that
would help guide and protect our
Navy’s vital nuclear submarines, those
funds are now going to pay for Trump’s
border wall.
Instead of our military using Federal
funds already authorized by Congress
to increase access to childcare for our
servicemembers and their families,
those funds are now going into paying
for Trump’s wall.
While this behavior from our Presi-
dent is predictable, it is no less wrong,
underhanded, and unacceptable, and I
know I am not the only one who thinks
that way.
Since the President’s rash move to
reprogram billions of dollars from our
military construction budget toward
his border wall, I have heard repeatedly
from constituents who are upset by
this President’s brazen acts of reckless-
ness and are wondering how the Presi-
dent of the United States can just step
over Congress to do whatever he wants
with our Federal budget, especially
when it is on the backs of our troops
and their families.
I refuse to stand by and do nothing
while this President hurts my State
and so many others. Why? Because he
cares more about his vanity project
than our troops, the military commu-
nity, or the American people.
That is why, in the coming days, I
plan to introduce new legislation that
will not only recoup the military con-
struction funds that were shamefully
raided for Trump’s border wall but put
in place new safeguards to make sure
no President today or in the future can
so effortlessly bypass the will of Con-
gress to loot the Federal budget.
We need to put a check on this Presi-
dent, plain and simple. Right now, we
can do so by standing up for Congress
and our constitutional authority to set
the Federal budget and pay our Na-
tion’s bills.
So I urge my colleagues to join
Democrats in voting to rescind Presi-
dent Trump’s bogus national emer-
gency declaration, taking that first
step to roll back the President’s plun-
der and hold him accountable because
as a coequal branch of our Federal Gov-
ernment, it is not just our job, it is our
sworn duty and one this body and our
Republican colleagues cannot ignore.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont.
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I
agree with my distinguished colleagues
from Washington State and New Mex-
ico for what they have said.
Sometimes casting a vote on the Sen-
ate floor is just a matter of course. It
is something we do routinely, often
without considering the impact of that
vote on the Senate as an institution,
let alone our constitutional Republic
as we know it, but this week’s vote on
President Trump’s national emergency
declaration is different. It is a pivotal
moment in this body’s history. It is a
stress test of the very notion of separa-
tion of powers. The Constitution
speaks of Congress as being a coequal
branch of government. Well, this is
going to be viewed as a moment when
Congress either asserted itself as a co-
equal branch of government or surren-
dered as a subordinate to the will of a
President who now claims his powers
are absolute.
This is a President who has said out
loud that the Constitution gives him
the right to do ‘‘whatever I want as

President.’’ It makes one wonder if the
President has ever actually read the
Constitution of the United States. This
President is attempting to ignore the
explicit will of Congress by simply de-
claring a national emergency to fund
his ‘‘big, beautiful’’ wall. That is after,
time and time and time again, he gave
us his word that Mexico would pay for
the wall.
For 3 years, he failed to convince
Congress that the wall was a good idea.
Even when his own party controlled
both the House of Representatives and
the U.S. Senate, his tweets and tan-
trums could not convince enough Mem-
bers that his cynical campaign promise
was worthy of tens of billions of dollars
of taxpayers’ money. He could not con-
vince anybody, Republican or Demo-
crat, that he was telling the truth
when he said Mexico would pay for it.
So when Congress did not comply, he
directed his yes-people to tell them he
could fund his pet project, nonetheless,
by declaring a national emergency out
of thin air and stealing the money from
our troops and their families.
He even admitted his national emer-
gency declaration was a matter of po-
litical expediency rather than justified
by facts. I remember him standing in
the Rose Garden. He said he did not
‘‘need’’ to invoke a national emer-
gency; he could ‘‘build the wall over a
longer period of time,’’ but he just
wanted to do it ‘‘faster.’’ Once again,
the whims and tweets of the President
were used to trample our Constitution.
President Trump’s declaration of a
national emergency to build his wall
should offend all 100 Senators—Repub-
licans and Democrats alike—in this
body. First and foremost, he is using it
to steal $3.6 billion from critical mili-
tary construction projects that would
benefit our men and women in uniform
and their families. This impacts 127
military construction projects, includ-
ing a child development center, an ele-
mentary school, a fire and rescue sta-
tion—all falling victim to his fixation
on the wall. He is telling the families
of our military who are living in sub-
standard housing—some of it with
mold and other damaging health condi-
tions—that, no, you are not going to
get that money you need to fix that up.
I am going to put it toward my wall.
We already ask our military families
to sacrifice so much to keep our coun-
try safe. Now they have to sacrifice,
yet again, and to what end? To keep
this President’s ego safe.
Furthermore, I would note that his
national emergency declaration is a
transparent end-run around Congress’s
constitutional power of the purse. Arti-
cle I, section 9 of the Constitution,
which I doubt the President has ever
bothered to read, states that Con-
gress—and Congress alone—decides
how to spend Americans’ hard-earned
tax dollars. That has been the case
from the time of the founding of this
country until today. It is one of the
most critical checks and balances in
our constitutional system. In our de-
mocracy, Presidents must respect—and
normally do—the appropriations deci-
sions of Congress but, for the first
time, not this President.
I was here when Congress enacted the
National Emergencies Act of 1976.
When we passed it then, we assumed
that any President would have enough
respect for the office to invoke the ex-
traordinary powers granted under it ju-
diciously and only in times when there
was, in fact, an emergency to be ad-
dressed.
But not this President. Where the
world sees women and children seeking
refuge at our southern border, he sees
criminals and terrorists invading our
country. Where the world sees declin-
ing border crossings—crossings have
dropped steeply since June—he sees an
escalating border crisis that only his
wall can fix. Facts may not matter to
a President willing to invent a hurri-
cane path with a sharpie marker, but
they should matter to us. We must not
allow this President to invoke such
sweeping powers—powers we granted to
him for real emergencies—simply to
address some emergency he has con-
cocted in his head.
So this week I hope all Senators, no
matter what their political background
is, will think carefully about their vote
on the President’s national emergency
declaration. I hope each of us thinks
long and hard about what it would
mean for our role as a coequal branch,
for the separation of powers, for the
Constitution, which has protected our
country all these years, and what
would it mean if we fail to reject this
naked power grab by President Trump.
In March, 12 of my Republican
friends joined Democrats in rejecting
the President’s emergency declaration,
forcing him to override our vote with a
veto. I hope every one of us tonight
will go home and read the Constitution
and realize what we must do. I hope
more Republicans will join Democrats
this time in voting aye on the joint
resolution of disapproval. We must
send this President a veto-proof mes-
sage that Congress will rise above
party to protect what is most precious
in our American democracy; the Sen-
ate will stand for the Constitution
above all else; that the Senate will be
the conscience of the Nation, as we
should be.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire.
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I
am pleased to join my colleagues and
very much appreciate Senator UDALL’s
leadership on the joint resolution we
are speaking to today. This is the reso-
lution that would end the President’s
unconstitutional emergency declara-
tion, which is diverting money from
critical military construction projects
to fund a costly and ineffective border
wall.
Congress has made it abundantly
clear that we did not provide funding
for the President’s border wall and that
we don’t approve of raiding military re-
sources to fund his campaign promise—
which, by the way, the President vowed
Mexico would pay for.
It is important to note that Congress
works on a bipartisan basis to provide
funding to secure the southern border.
According to the Constitution, it is
Congress and not the President who
holds the power of the purse. Just 6
months ago, in a strong bipartisan
vote, a majority of this body—59 Sen-
ators—successfully passed the resolu-
tion disapproving of the President’s
emergency declaration. Unfortunately,
President Trump chose to veto that
legislation, which is why we have
brought it to the floor again for a vote.
It is imperative that this legislative
body—this Senate—defend its author-
ity as derived from the Constitution
and protect funding that is vital to our
troops and to our national security.
I think it is difficult to overstate the
critical role military construction
projects play in maintaining military
readiness and supporting our national
defense. Yet this administration is
treating funding set aside for our na-
tional security like a slush fund.
Take military construction, for in-
stance. At the Portsmouth Naval ship-
yard in New Hampshire and Maine—it
is on the border between New Hamp-
shire and Maine—any disruptions for
funding in construction projects can
result in costly delays to our military’s
carefully crafted plans to upgrade
aging infrastructure. Delays in projects
that support the shipyard’s mission
threaten to exacerbate the Navy’s al-
ready high demand for submarine
maintenance and the projected sub-
marine shortfall in the coming years.
In addition, New Hampshire’s Na-
tional Guard readiness centers are in
desperate need of modernization, and
they can’t afford further delays to
readiness center improvements. All
those projects are funded through the
military construction program.
While New Hampshire’s and Maine’s
shipyard and National Guard were
spared from President Trump’s latest
money grab, the same can’t be said for
127 other important military construc-
tion projects across this country.
The 552 middle school children at
Fort Campbell in the majority leader’s
home State of Kentucky will have to
wait for a new school as President
Trump diverts construction funding to
the border.
Critical projects in Virginia that
would improve a cyber operations facil-
ity and replace hazardous materials in
warehouses are another casualty of
President Trump’s political games.
The Child Development Center in
Maryland, the missile field in Alaska,
the weapon maintenance shop in Ala-
bama—the list of projects that are af-
fected by the President’s unconstitu-
tional mandate just goes on and on. It
includes hundreds of millions of dollars
for critical infrastructure to support
the Defense Department’s European
Deterrence Initiative. What message
does that send to our European allies

on our efforts to deter Russian aggres-
sion?
The impact of the President’s actions
and Congress’s own complacency is
painfully real to the men and women
who serve our Nation. These are the
same men and women who are being
deprived of the resources they need to
complete their mission.
Perhaps not surprising, there are now
reports indicating that the Trump ad-
ministration is again planning to take
military construction funds appro-
priated by Congress to build the border
wall. According to the Washington
Post, you can see this pretty clearly.
The administration plans to pitch its
appropriations request to Congress as
replenishment money to the Depart-
ment of Defense for the money they
took this year to fund the border wall.
A Trump administration official said:
The plan is to sell it as replenishment
money. . . . Then once they got it from Con-
gress, they would take it again.
This isn’t just a one-time deal. We
are talking about the administration
setting us up to do this again and again
and again. This type of deception from
the administration makes funding the
government extremely difficult for
Congress because we can’t trust—we
don’t know if the President is negoti-
ating in good faith.
The Members of the legislative
branch are endowed by the Constitu-
tion with the power to fund the govern-
ment. We must be sure that the re-
sources we provide in spending legisla-
tion are being used as they were in-
tended by the Congress. This constitu-
tional duty is particularly salient when
the President has shown such a fla-
grant disregard for congressional in-
tent and the constitutional separation
of powers. The authority of the Con-
gress is very clear: The power of the
purse is held by the legislative branch.
Those powers were enumerated for the
very reason that we are here today—to
shield against an overreaching Execu-
tive.
This isn’t about Democrat versus Re-
publican; this is about whether Con-
gress votes to uphold its powers and re-
sponsibilities—powers and responsibil-
ities that are enshrined in the Con-
stitution. We must take action now in
defense of both our Constitution and
our national security.
I would urge my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to protect our con-
stitutional authority as Members of
Congress, to defend our national secu-
rity, and to support the resolution to
terminate President Trump’s emer-
gency declaration.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico.
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I very
much appreciate being joined on the
floor by my colleagues at this critical
time in history. Senator SHAHEEN just
spoke. We also had Senator MURRAY
and Senator LEAHY down here.
This issue will come to a head tomor-
row. We are really at a crossroads. This
body can continue to allow the Presi-
dent to subvert our constitutional au-
thority to appropriate, or we can take
back our power of the purse and exer-
cise it as the Founders intended. The
issue before us is not partisan; it is
constitutional. If we don’t put the Con-
stitution above party, above politics,
we might as well pack up our bags and
go home. The voters did not send us
here to shirk our responsibilities. His-
tory will not be kind to us if we allow
the Executive to run roughshod over
our constitutional authority.
For the second time, we have intro-
duced a bipartisan resolution to termi-
nate the President’s national emer-
gency declaration along our southern
border. I thank Senators COLLINS and
SHAHEEN for once again joining this
resolution and affirming their commit-
ment to the Constitution.
Our first vote on this resolution in
March passed 59 to 41. We had strong
bipartisan support because the Presi-
dent’s emergency declaration is clearly
an end run around Congress. We have
the power to bring this resolution back
every 6 months. I hope we can add to
our majority this time because what
were once fears about a so-called emer-
gency in March have become a stark
reality in September.
While I firmly oppose the President’s
approach on immigration, this vote is
not about whether you oppose or sup-
port that approach. In March, a Repub-
lican Senator wrote in conviction
about the President’s emergency dec-
laration:
It is my responsibility to be a steward of
the article I branch, to preserve the separa-
tion of powers and to curb the kind of execu-
tive overreach that Congress has allowed to
fester for the better part of the past century.
I stood by that principle during the Obama
administration, and I stand by it now.
We all have another opportunity to
stand with the Constitution and to ob-
ject to a President actively diverting
billions in defense funding for a polit-
ical purpose. Congress, not the Presi-
dent, was given the power of the purse
to make sure taxpayer money was
spent on projects with broad public
support.
We have different views in Congress,
but as a whole, we have responded to
the American people, and we have not
appropriated all the funds the Presi-
dent has sought for his wall. But in-
stead of allowing Congress to decide on
spending, which is what the Constitu-
tion envisions, the President caused
the longest shutdown in American his-
tory to get his wall. That 35-day shut-
down caused a lot of pain and anxiety
for many Federal workers and contrac-
tors and their families in New Mexico
and across the Nation. When the shut-
down didn’t work, the President issued
his emergency declaration.
If we allow this President to issue an
emergency declaration to get funding
for his wall, we will be setting a dan-
gerous precedent—a precedent that
could be used by future Presidents on
issues my Republican colleagues surely
wouldn’t like.
The President is now taking $3.6 bil-
lion from 127 military construction
projects that we have approved and
funded. We all know the rigor with
which these projects have been vetted,
scrutinized, and approved. According to
the Pentagon, these projects are nec-
essary for national security and mili-
tary readiness, necessary to ensure the
safety of our men and women in uni-
form and their children. In other
words, they are not projects simply de-
signed to fulfill a campaign slogan.
Two projects in New Mexico are on
the chopping block, and both are crit-
ical. One is an $85 million drone pilot
training center at Holloman Air Force
Base to replace a facility that is falling
apart, and the other is a $40 million se-
cure information technology facility at
White Sands Missile Range. Both of
those are gone.
In Utah, the Air Force has sought a
new control center at Hill Air Force
Base to replace ‘‘structurally deficient,
dilapidated World War II-era ware-
houses’’ for mission control.
In Louisiana, the Air National Guard
sought to replace an aircraft parking
ramp in a New Orleans facility that ex-
poses the public to ‘‘unacceptable
risks’’ of being impacted by an explo-
sive accident.
In Indiana, Army servicemembers
have worked in violation of safety
standards for handling explosives and
need additional space from munitions.
In Kentucky, the military seeks to
repair substandard, deficient, inad-
equate, and undersized facilities at a
majority school at Fort Campbell that
impairs the overall education program
for the children of servicemembers.
Back in March, we worried that this
would happen, but now it is a reality.
Our men and women in uniform and
their children are paying for the wall.
And if we do not stand up and stop it
today, it will happen again and again.
This is unacceptable, and I believe it is
unlawful and unconstitutional. We here
in the Senate have decided to fund
these projects and others in 23 States
instead of a border wall, and with good
reason.
Some in Congress are calling for us
to backfill 127 projects and reappro-
priate the funds for them. Backfilling
does not solve the problem. It does not
repair the constitutional violation. It
only gives license to the President to
continue raiding funds we have already
appropriated for military construction
projects. Unless we stop the emer-
gency, the backfilled money will be
subject to being raided again. If your
house is robbed, it is foolish to buy new
valuables without putting a new lock
on the door.
Canceling these 127 projects is not
just a one-off; we all know the Presi-
dent fully intends to keep it. It has al-
ready been reported that if the Presi-
dent doesn’t get the $5 billion he has
requested for his wall in 2020, the ad-
ministration plans to take another $3.6
billion from the Pentagon’s construc-
tion budget.

f
THE PHILIPPINES
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President,
killings of environmental defenders are
shockingly common in Latin America,
Africa, and Asia. The assassination of
Berta Caceres in Honduras 3 years ago,
orchestrated by top officials of a hy-
droelectric company and carried out by
retired and Active-Duty soldiers who
had received training from the United
States, was emblematic of the wide-
spread use of harassment, threats, and
murder to silence those who coura-
geously call for changes in policies and
practices to protect the environment.
According to a report released today
by Global Witness, the Philippines has
the highest number of killings in Asia
of people who oppose illegal logging,
destructive mining, and corrupt agri-
business, with at least 30 cases docu-
mented in 2018. The total number is
likely higher, as some investigations
are ongoing. Many of the victims sim-
ply wanted a say in how their land and
the country’s natural resources are
used. The perpetrators are almost
never arrested or prosecuted.
On July 25, 2016, the Philippines’
newly elected President Rodrigo
Duterte delivered his first state of the
nation address. He promised to safe-
guard the country’s rural and indige-
nous communities, tackle corruption,
and protect the environment. The re-
sults since then paint a very different
and distressing picture. If President
Duterte meant what he said, he has
failed miserably. According to Global
Witness, in the 3 years before Duterte
took office at least 65 land and environ-
mental defenders were murdered. That
was appalling enough. But in the 3
years since he came to power, that
number rose to 113. At least 31 of those
murders were reportedly committed by
the Philippine Armed Forces, whose
soldiers and officers act with near total
impunity.
The Philippines is a major recipient
of U.S. military aid, and we are per-
ceived by the families of the victims to
be enablers of these crimes. In addition
to increasing support for local environ-
mental defenders, the Secretary of
State and Administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development
should urge the Duterte government to
ensure that the right to free, prior, and
informed consent of those impacted by
policies and practices that threaten
their land and natural resources is re-
spected. This is necessary not only to
prevent the destruction of forests and
farms, the pollution of watersheds, and
the extinction of species, but to avoid
confrontations and violence that result
when extractive industries, supported
by the Armed Forces and police, run
roughshod over local communities.
The Secretaries of State and Defense
should also ensure that those in the
Philippine Armed Forces who receive
our aid respect the rights of civilians
and are accountable to the rule of law.
When abuses occur they should be thor-
oughly investigated and the individuals
responsible brought to justice. The
Leahy Laws require that, and it is the
responsibility of U.S. officials to en-
sure that they are enforced.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, sec-
tion 36(b) of the Arms Export Control

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Thailand—AH–6i Helicopters
The Government of Thailand has requested
to buy eight (8) AH–6i light attack recon-
naissance helicopters; fifty (50) AGM–114R
Hellfire missiles; and two-hundred (200) Ad-
vance Precision Kill Weapon System
(APKWS) Rockets. Also included are ten (10)

ten (10) AN/ARC 201E–VHF–FM; ten (10) AN/
ARC–231 w/ MX–4027; ten (10) LN–251 Inertial
Navigation System/Global Positioning Sys-
tem (EGI); Aircrew Trainer (ACT); Pilot
Desktop Trainer (PDT); Virtual Maintenance
Trainer (VMT;, contractor provided pilot and
maintainer training peculiar ground support
equipment; spares; publications; integrated
product support; technical assistance; qual-
ity assurance team; transportation; and
other related elements of logistics and pro-
gram support. The total estimated program
cost is $400 million.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security objectives of
the United States by helping to improve the
security of a Major Non-NATO ally in INDO-
PACOM. Thailand is a strategic partner com-
mitted to contributing to regional security.
The proposed sale of the AH–6i helicopter
will improve the Royal Thai Army’s (RTA)
light attack capability to strengthen its
homeland defense and deter regional threats.
These AH–6i helicopters will replace the
RTA’s aging fleet of seven AH–IF Cobra heli-
copters. As part of a broader military mod-
ernization effort, these AH–6i helicopters
will provide light attack reconnaissance for
close air support to special operations forces,
Stryker infantry soldiers and border guard
units. Thailand will have no difficulty ab-
sorbing this equipment into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region,
The principal contractor for the AH–6i is
Boeing Company, Mesa, Arizona. There are
no known offset agreements proposed in con-
nection with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
not require the assignment of any permanent
additional U.S. Government or Contractor
representatives to Thailand.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness s a result of this proposed
sale.

Annex Item No. vii
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The AH–6i Light Attack Helicopter is a
commercial-off-the-shelf, light attack/recon-
naissance helicopter to include AN/APX–123
Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode S
Transponder, AN/ARC 201E–VHF/FM Radio,
AN/ARC–231 w/MX–4027 Radio and LN 251
Embedded GPS/INS (EGI). The helicopter
will be equipped with the WESCAM MX–lODi
Sight/Targeting Sensor to ensure com-
monality and interoperability with the other
aircraft platforms. The airframe itself does
not contain sensitive technology.
2. Identification and security classification
of sensitive technological information and/or
restricted information contained in the
equipment, major components, subsystems,
software, technical data (Performance,
Maintenance, R&M, etc.) documentation,
training devices and services to be conveyed
with the proposed sale. Also a brief expla-
nation of why information is sensitive:
a. The AN/APX–123, Identification Friend
or Foe (IFF) Transponder, is a space diver-
sity transponder and is installed on various
military platforms. When installed in con-
junction with platform antennas and the
RCU ( or other appropriate control unit), the
transponder provides identification, altitude
and surveillance reporting in response to in-
terrogations from airborne, ground-based
and/or surface interrogators. The trans-
ponder provides operational capabilities for
Mark XII Identification IFF capabilities of
Modes 1, 2, 2/ A, C and 4&5 and Modes S (lev-
els 1, 2, and 3 capable).
b. The LN–251 INS/GPS is a satellite based
positioning system coupled to the aircraft
inertial navigation system to provide air-
craft position and navigation. The INS/GPS
has an embedded SAASM and has gyro and
accelerometers that have been evaluated as
MTCR Category II controlled items, specifi-
cally items 9.A.6 and 9.A.8.
c. The WESCAM MX–10Di is a small Multi-
Sensor, Multi-Spectral Imaging System with

bination of AGM–114 missiles. The launcher
provides electronic functions required for
the missile and launcher to communicate
with the platform through MIL–STD–1760
and MIL–STD–1553 interfaces. The produc-
tion quad-rail configuration was designed for
use on the AH–640 Apache Longbow but is
also commonly used on a wide variety of
other rotary-wing platforms across all serv-
ices. The M299 launcher has also been suc-
cessfully re-configured into a dual rail

TRIBUTE TO ESTHER CODY SPLITT
Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President,
today I wish to recognize and honor Es-
ther Cody Splitt, on the occasion of her
100th birthday.
Her incredible life of ‘‘firsts’’ and ex-
traordinary service to her community
and country began with her birth in
the historic year of 1919, the year
women earned the right to vote. With
encouragement from her smart and
strong-willed Irish mother, Cody grew
up in Wausau during the Great Depres-
sion, when money for entertainment
was nonexistent. Instead of sending
Cody to the movies, she told her to go
to the county courthouse and watch
the lawyers for free. ‘‘Enchanted’’ by
what she saw, Cody returned home and
told her mother she had decided to be-
come a lawyer. Her mother supported

her dreams and told her there was ‘‘no
reason she could not be a wife, mother
and a lawyer, just as a man is a hus-
band, father and lawyer.’’ That pre-
scient inspiration became reality when
Cody graduated from the University of
Wisconsin Law School, one of only five
women in the class of 1949.
Before attending law school, Cody al-
ready had a successful career as one of
the first women to serve in the U.S.
Navy. She said the day she was admit-
ted to the WAVES—Women Accepted
for Volunteer Services—was the turn-
ing point of her life. Fascinated by pol-
itics, Cody was disappointed to learn
she was assigned to Wright Patterson
Air Force Base in Ohio. She said to the
assigning officer, ‘‘That’s lovely, but I
really would like to go to Washington,
D.C. What do you suppose?’’ She was
granted assignment to a naval intel-
ligence unit in Washington, DC, where
she worked on cracking the Japanese
code during World War II. She was
quickly promoted to lead her fellow
WAVES in Washington, a post where
she oversaw the careers and well-being
of 200 women. At the end of the war,
Cody heard the GI bill would pay for
her tuition to law school, a fact she
confirmed by going to the Library of
Congress and reading the entire bill.
Cody married her husband, Harley,
also a UW law student, and moved to
Appleton after graduation to open the
second woman-owned law firm in
Outagamie County. It was not easy for
even a highly skilled female attorney
to attract clients in the 1940s. In fact,
her first client walked out of her office
upon learning ‘‘Cody Splitt’’ was a
woman. The scarcity of a client base
forced her to close her practice after a
year. Undaunted, Cody dedicated her-
self to her community, serving as a su-
pervisor on the Outagamie County
Board, president of the Outagamie
County Bar Association, and a member
of the American Association of Univer-
sity Women, the Fox Valley Human
Rights Council, and the Alliance for
the Mentally Ill. She also held various
leadership roles in the Republican
Party. She built a thriving law prac-
tice from which she retired at the age
of 75.
Cody has received many well-de-
served accolades for her work, includ-
ing a Lifetime Achievement Award
from the Wisconsin Law Journal and a
Woman of the Year Award from the Na-
tional Organization for Women. Her
legacy will live on for decades to come
through her scholarship and other
charitable funds with the Appleton
Community Foundation.
I am privileged to acknowledge the
life and work of Cody Splitt, and on the
occasion of her 100th birthday, I wish
her good health and happiness for
many years to come.

TRIBUTE TO DR. GAIL
ZIMMERMAN
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President,
today I wish to celebrate the St. An-
thony Tri-Parish Catholic School
Foundation’s 2019 honoree, Dr. Gail
Zimmerman.
The foundation supports the wonder-
ful work of the St. Anthony Tri-Parish
Catholic School in Casper, WY. The
school is dedicated to achieving aca-
demic excellence in a faith-filled com-
munity and living a life committed to
Christian service. Since 1927, the school
and staff have provided a high standard
of academic achievement while instill-
ing Christian values. The schools
strong religious and educational lead-
ership to Casper students from pre-
school through eighth grade.
On October 10, 2019, the foundation
will host their annual Joy Breakfast.
The foundation honors individuals who
make outstanding contributions to St.
Anthony School and provide excep-
tional support to the Casper commu-
nity. Dr. Gail Zimmerman is the per-
fect choice for this honor. Gail, with
his late wife Anne, has a long history
of personal beneficence and public serv-
ice. The community looks forward to
this breakfast and recognizing the an-
nual honoree’s invaluable contribution
and dedication to the St. Anthony’s
Tri-Parish Catholic School Founda-
tion.
Gail is an accomplished academic, a
selfless servant, and an avid sports-
man. His father was a farmer and pas-
tor, contributing greatly to Gail’s
work ethic and Christian values. Gail
attended high school in Nebraska, then
served in the U.S. Army. While serving,
Gail met his wife, Lois. The ceasefire
in Korea occurred while he was in
training, enabling him to return to Ne-
braska for his undergraduate edu-
cation.
Gail received his master’s at the Uni-
versity of Montana while teaching in
Torrington, WY, and earned his Ph.D.
in physiology and microbiology at the
University of Wyoming while teaching
in Casper, WY. He taught nurses and
premedical students at Casper College
for 23 years before furthering his edu-
cation and becoming a broker. Dr. Zim-
merman was elected to the Wyoming
House of Representatives in 1985, then
to the Wyoming Senate in 1989. He
served a total of 14 years in our State
legislature.
In 1975, Lois passed away. Together
they had four children: Rhonda, Mitch-
ell, Michael, and Renee. Five years
later, Gail married Anne Templeton, a
surgeon with whom I worked. They
spent 24 happy years until her passing
in 2004.
Gail’s community involvement, phil-
anthropic engagements, and hobby in-
terests are extensive. He has been in-
fluential with the Casper Petroleum
Club, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation,
National Rifle Association, Safari Club
International, Polestar Outdoors, the
Dallas Safari Club Wyoming Chapter,
and the Wyoming Water Quality and
Pollution Control Association. He also
served as the Director of the Werner
Wildlife Museum and Wyoming State
Wastewater Training Center, Chairman
and CEO of the Wyoming Employee Re-
source Capital & Service, and Trustee
of the John Templeton Foundation as
well as the Zimmerman Family Foun-
dation. He somehow finds time to at-
tend collector car shows and Alaskan
fishing trips. Gail is also a member of
the Casper Rotary Club.
Gail and his wife Anne generously
contributed their time and resources to
Wyoming’s schools and spiritual
growth. They promoted human rights
and supported fellow Christians around
the world. The Zimmerman Science
Awards and Zimmerman Family Foun-
dation helped countless Wyoming stu-
dents and people in need to further
their education. They provided a much
needed lift to those seeking to unlock
their true potential. Gail is a pillar of
the Casper community. He exemplifies
Christian values and is a testament to
the Code of the West.
Madam President, it is with great
honor that I recognize this outstanding
member of our Wyoming community.
My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending
our congratulations to Dr. Gail Zim-
merman upon his selection for this spe-
cial award.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
CENTENNIAL OF JOHN BROWN
UNIVERSITY
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President,
today I wish to honor John Brown Uni-
versity’s centennial anniversary.
On September 29, 1919, John E.
Brown, Sr., founded a school in Siloam
Springs, AR, to educate young men and
women of any means ready to dedicate
themselves to a life of public service.
Guided by one fundamental belief,
‘‘Christ over all,’’ education at JBU
has never been merely academic. The
school’s founder was committed to the
holistic development of students and
sought to form an institution that
would serve as a place to learn, as well
as a place to worship and work with
emphasis placed equally on the head,
heart and hands.
In its early days, JBU offered an as-
sociate’s degree program and consisted
of three colleges: Siloam Springs
School of the Bible, John E. Brown Vo-
cational College, and John E. Brown
College. Students were required to
choose an academic major, attend
classes half the day, and work the
other half.
In 1934, JBU expanded into a 4-year
university with degree programs in
construction, engineering, agriculture,
and education, along with a core of lib-
eral arts and Bible classes. By 1962, it
was nationally accredited. Since then,
academic emphasis and growth have
continued to flourish with the estab-
lishment of an honors program, a de-
gree completion program, and a grad-
uate school. JBU now has an enroll-
ment of nearly 2,500 undergraduate and
graduate students from 38 States and 53
foreign countries.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RENO
+ SPARKS CHAMBER OF COM-
MERCE
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I come forward today to recog-
nize the 100th anniversary of the Reno
+ Sparks Chamber of Commerce. In
1890, the Reno Commercial Club and
Reno Business League were born out of
a need to enhance the city of Reno as
a commercial center. In 1919, the two
merged to form the Reno Chamber of
Commerce, and in 1970, the chamber ex-
panded to include the city of Sparks. In
2018, the Latino Chamber of Commerce
merged with the Reno + Sparks Cham-
ber of Commerce to provide wider rep-
resentation for the community’s diver-
sity of businesses and people.
Today, the Reno + Sparks Chamber
of Commerce is the largest business or-
ganization in northern Nevada with
over 1,800 registered businesses that
employ over 85,000 individuals in
Washoe County. The Chamber has 42
ambassadors, as well as volunteers
from a wide variety of industries who
meet monthly to celebrate success sto-
ries and aid in event planning. The
chamber also delivers more than 4 mil-
lion annual leads and referrals through
its online directory and offers free edu-
cational programs, training events, and
countless opportunities for member
connectivity. Through the Reno +
Sparks Leadership Program, now in its
34th year with 1,100 alumni, the cham-
ber cultivates leaders by providing op-
portunities to volunteer and support
the community while immersing par-
ticipants in the issues and challenges
of the region. It also hosts elected offi-
cials and issues its public policy plat-
form each State legislative session to
advocate on behalf of free enterprise
and a robust economy.
Since 1919, the Reno + Sparks Cham-
ber of Commerce has advocated on be-
half of all businesses, provided re-
sources and support to its members,
and connected its members with new
customers and partners. The northern
Nevada economic landscape is stronger
and more diverse because of the Reno +
Sparks Chamber of Commerce’s many
efforts to support local leaders and
small businesses throughout the re-
gion.
Through booms and busts, the Reno +
Sparks Chamber of Commerce has been
a steadfast force in our community.
From ribbon-cutting ceremonies to its
long-running leadership program, the
Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce
has been a reliable and valuable re-
source for northern Nevadans. Its dedi-
cation to economic prosperity and
communal inclusivity for northern Ne-
vada has stood for a century, and I am
excited to see what they have in store
for the next 100 years.∑

TRIBUTE TO MARK DUFFIN
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, along
with my colleagues Senator James
Risch, Representative Mike Simpson,
and Representative Russ Fulcher, I
congratulate Mark Duffin on his retire-
ment from the Idaho Sugarbeet Grow-
ers Association, after serving as the as-
sociation’s executive director for the
past more than 28 years.
We have greatly valued Mark’s in-
sight and partnership on agricultural
and related issues over the years. Mark
has not only been an Idaho agricultural
leader, but also a national agricultural
leader, given the high profile of the
sugarbeet industry and the crucial role
Idaho plays in supplying the market.
Mark has been a stalwart advocate for
Idaho’s sugarbeet growers and provided
essential guidance on Federal policy
matters impacting the industry, par-
ticularly trade, transportation and
labor. From sharing the growers’ per-
spective on multiple farm bill reau-
thorizations, international trade agree-
ment negotiations, natural resource
management, and much more. Mark
has provided helpful perspective on
Federal policy over the years.
Throughout, his judicious, considerate,
and experienced approach has been in-
strumental.
His understanding of the challenges
of agricultural production and appre-
ciation for those he represents is ap-
parent in his thoughtful advocacy.
Mark grew up on a farm in south-
eastern Idaho and farmed with his
brother before leading the association.
The majority of this Idaho congres-
sional delegation had the honor of serv-
ing with him in the Idaho State Legis-
lature, as Mark served in the legisla-
ture from 1984–1990. Mark also served
as the Power County Farm Bureau
president, president of Food Producers
of Idaho, and president of the Univer-
sity of Idaho College of Agriculture’s
Agricultural Consulting Council.
We thank Mark for his assistance on
behalf of Idahoans and the producers he
has represented and wish him well on
his retirement. We hope Mark enjoys
his retirement, but should he find him-
self with some spare time, he can al-
ways find work driving trucks for his
friends and neighbors in the Idaho sug-
arbeet industry.∑

TRIBUTE TO JERI BARR
∑ Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President,
today, I am honored to recognize in the
RECORD Mrs. Jeri Barr of Marietta, GA,
who announced earlier this year that
she would step down from the Center
for Family Resources and whose serv-
ice to the community will soon be cele-
brated at a special event in her honor.
The Center for Family Resources pro-
vides service to families and individ-
uals who are homeless or who are in
danger of becoming homeless. Through
short-term housing, job-hunting help,
food assistance, and other services, the
organization accomplishes much for
the community.
Jeri Barr has been at the helm of the
Center for Family Resources in Cobb
County, GA, for 35 years. Cobb is my
home county, and I have been glad to
watch this organization grow under her
leadership.
When Jeri took over in 1984, the orga-
nization had a staff of 11 and a budget
of $350,000. Today, the Center for Fam-
ily Resources owns and operates the
Mansour Center, a $10 million, 60,000-
square-foot facility that offers space to
other nonprofits and conference space
for the public, allowing for additional
revenue to benefit the center’s mission.
Now, there are 25 staff members, and
the organization’s budget is nearly $3.5
million.
For many years, Jeri has given back
to the community. She served the
United Way, including as the director
of their Volunteer Cobb service. She
also led the East Cobb Newcomers
Club, Cobb Christmas, Cobb County
Rape Crisis Center, and Cobb County
Community Council. Numerous other
organizations have also benefitted
from her work on their boards. Thanks
to her leadership, each of these organi-
zations has benefitted.
While she will be missed by the staff
and all those involved with the Center
for Family Resources, I am confident
that she has prepared the organization
well for the future. As Jeri and her
husband, former U.S. Representative
Bob Barr, prepare for this next exciting
chapter, I congratulate them and wish
them much happiness enjoying their
children and grandchildren.∑

sadly, the State of Georgia has said
goodbye to one of its finest sons, COL

Bonnie and I offer our deepest condo-

colleagues.
Gary served as a member of my Geor-

where he provided me and my staff
with valuable insight, advice, and en-
couragement.
I first met Gary during a visit to
Fort Benning in 2016, and I had the
good pleasure of meeting him many
times after that. I was always struck
by Gary’s warmth, his wisdom, and his
stalwart dedication to service. No mat-
ter who you are, Gary treated you like
a friend. He always went out of his way
to help.
Gary was the epitome of a servant
hero.
Like many brave Americans, Gary
heeded the call of duty and entered the
Armed Services. While in the Army, he
received many prestigious awards, in-
cluding the Silver Star, for his bravery
and dedication to service. In 2018, Gary

Gary’s dedication extended far be-
yond his time in the military. He was
always a tireless advocate for his com-
munity, holding leadership positions in
organizations like the Greater Colum-
bus Chamber of Commerce, the His-
toric Chattahoochee River Club, and
the Columbus Uptown Board, among
many others. In addition, Gary was a
leader in his local church.
The Columbus area and the entire
State of Georgia have been made better
thanks in large part to people like
Gary.
As we mourn Gary’s passing, we
should recognize his incredible legacy.
It is one of warmth, decency, service,
and honor.∑

NATING SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, AS
‘‘NATIONAL URBAN WILDLIFE
REFUGE DAY’’
Mr. GARDNER (for himself and Mr.
BENNET) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary:
S. RES. 324
Whereas over 80 percent of people in the
United States live in or near cities, which
typically have limited opportunities for resi-
dents to access nature and experience out-
door recreation;
Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge Sys-
tem under the United States Fish and Wild-
life Service manages 567 national wildlife
refuges that constitute a national network
of land and water managed for the conserva-
tion of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United
States;
Whereas national wildlife refuges provide
opportunities for people to discover and ap-
preciate nature;
Whereas there is a refuge located within a
1-hour drive of every metropolitan area in
the United States;
Whereas the Urban Wildlife Conservation
Program under the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service—
(1) focuses on introducing people living in
densely populated areas to the more than 100
national wildlife refuges near urban areas;
and
(2) promotes wildlife conservation and the
enjoyment of hunting, fishing, and other
wildlife-dependent recreational activities
close to where people live;
Whereas the Urban Wildlife Conservation
Program focuses on public-private partner-
ships—
(1) to improve wildlife conservation; and
(2) to promote access to recreation on and
off national wildlife refuges, including rec-
reational activities such as hunting and fish-
ing; and
Whereas by exploring community-centered
approaches to address local needs, engaging
the next generation of anglers and hunters,
and providing infrastructure and safe access,
the Urban Wildlife Conservation Program
helps local organizations, cities, and towns
across the United States engage in conserva-
tion activities: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates September 29, 2019, as ‘‘Na-
tional Urban Wildlife Refuge Day’’;
(2) encourages the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service to increase access to out-
door recreational opportunities for urban
communities; and

S. RES. 326
Whereas the spirit of service has defined
the United States and strengthened the
bonds of community for nearly 250 years;
Whereas September 12, 2019, will mark the
25th anniversary of the first class of
AmeriCorps members, who pledged to ‘‘get
things done’’;
Whereas, since 1994, more than 1,100,000 in-
dividuals of all ages and backgrounds have
joined AmeriCorps, serving more than
1,500,000,000 hours and improving the lives of
countless people in the United States;
Whereas AmeriCorps members address the
most pressing challenges facing the United
States by educating students for jobs of the
21st century, expanding economic oppor-
tunity, addressing the needs of military fam-
ilies and a generation of veterans returning
from war, helping communities rebuild after
natural disasters, supporting communities
combatting the opioid epidemic, and pre-
serving the parks and public lands of the
United States;
Whereas approximately 75,000 AmeriCorps
members serve each year in more than 21,000
locations nationwide and, along with more
than 200,000 Senior Corps volunteers serving
in more than 23,000 locations, bolster the
civic, neighborhood, and faith-based organi-
zations that are so vital to the well-being of
the United States;
Whereas AmeriCorps expands opportunities
for AmeriCorps members by providing expe-
rience, career skills, and support for higher
education, and, since 1994, AmeriCorps mem-
bers have earned more than $3,700,000,000 in
Segal AmeriCorps Education Awards to
repay qualified student loans or pay for
other higher education expenses;
Whereas AmeriCorps is a model public-pri-
vate partnership that generates hundreds of
millions of dollars of nongovernmental re-
sources each year to strengthen community
impact and increase return on taxpayer dol-
lars;
Whereas AmeriCorps, working hand-in-
hand with its network of Governor-appointed
State service commissions, has developed an
efficient and effective structure for engaging
individuals in results-driven service that is
poised for further growth and success in the
future;
Whereas AmeriCorps was built upon dec-
ades-old legacies of citizen service estab-
lished by the Peace Corps, the Civilian Con-
servation Corps, the Volunteers in Service to
America (VISTA) program, the Senior Com-
panion Program, the Foster Grandparent
Program, and the Retired and Senior Volun-
teer Program (RSVP);
Whereas national service programs create
understanding that unites citizens and
bridges gaps across races, generations, social
classes, and geographic boundaries;
Whereas national service brings tangible
benefits to the communities being served as
well as to individuals providing the service,
including improved health, expanded eco-
nomic opportunity, and increased civic par-
ticipation;
Whereas AmeriCorps members and Senior
Corps volunteers demonstrate commitment,
dedication, and patriotism by making an in-
tensive commitment to service and, after
their terms of service, remain engaged in our
communities as volunteers, public servants,
and civic leaders at disproportionately high
rates; and
Whereas the Corporation for National and
Community Service has led efforts to im-
prove lives, strengthen communities, and
foster civic engagement through service and
volunteering in the United States for the
last quarter century: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) acknowledges the significant impact
and value of AmeriCorps members, alumni,
and community partners over the past 25
years;
(2) recognizes the legacy of service of Sen-
ior Corps volunteers and all of the national
service members in the United States; and
(3) encourages citizens of all ages to find
ways to give back to their communities and
the United States through AmeriCorps and
Senior Corps programs.

September 24, 2019
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. HAWLEY, Ms. WAR-
REN, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. JONES, Mr. SCOTT
of Florida, Ms. SINEMA, and Ms. ROSEN)
submitted the following resolution;
which was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 327
Whereas individuals who are 65 years of
age or older (referred to in this preamble as
‘‘older adults’’) are the fastest growing seg-
ment of the population in the United States,
and the number of older adults in the United
States will increase from approximately
52,000,000 in 2018 to an estimated 95,000,000 by
2060;
Whereas approximately 30 percent of older
adults in the United States fall each year,
with each 5-year increment in age increasing
the risk of falls;
Whereas falls are the leading cause of both
fatal and nonfatal injuries among older
adults;
Whereas, in 2018, approximately 3,000,000
older adults were treated in hospital emer-
gency departments for fall-related injuries,
and nearly 870,000 of those older adults were
subsequently hospitalized;
Whereas, in 2017, more than 31,000 older
adults died from injuries related to uninten-
tional falls, and the death rate from falls of
older adults in the United States is expected
to continue to sharply rise to more than
100,000 per year by 2030;
Whereas, in 2015, the total direct medical
cost of fall-related injuries for older adults,
adjusted for inflation, was approximately
$50,000,000,000;
Whereas, if the rate of increase in falls is
not slowed, the annual cost of fall injuries
will surpass $100,000,000,000 by 2030; and
Whereas evidence-based programs reduce
falls by utilizing cost-effective strategies,
such as exercise programs to improve bal-
ance and strength, medication management,
vision improvement, reduction of home haz-
ards, and fall prevention education: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates September 23, 2019, as ‘‘Na-
tional Falls Prevention Awareness Day’’;
(2) recognizes that there are proven, cost-
effective falls prevention programs and poli-
cies;
(3) commends the 72 member organizations
of the Falls Free Coalition and the falls pre-
vention coalitions in 43 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia for their efforts to work
together to increase education and aware-
ness about preventing falls among older
adults;
(4) encourages businesses, individuals, Fed-
eral, State, and local governments, the pub-
lic health community, and health care pro-
viders to work together to raise awareness of
falls in an effort to reduce the incidence of
falls among older adults in the United
States;
(5) recognizes the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention for its work developing
and evaluating interventions for all mem-
bers of health care teams to make falls pre-
vention a routine part of clinical care;
(6) recognizes the Administration for Com-
munity Living for its work to promote ac-
cess to evidence-based programs and services
in communities across the United States;
(7) encourages State health departments
and State units on aging, which provide sig-
nificant leadership in reducing injuries and
related health care costs by collaborating
with organizations and individuals, to reduce
falls among older adults; and
(8) encourages experts in the field of falls
prevention to share their best practices so
that their success can be replicated by oth-
ers.

NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT TO
PROCEEDING
I, Senator RON WYDEN, intend to ob-
ject to proceeding to S. 1273, a bill to
amend title 17, United States Code, to
establish an alternative dispute resolu-
tion program for copyright small
claims, and for other purposes, dated
September 24, 2019 for the reasons as
stated in the RECORD.
OBJECTION TO THE COPYRIGHT ALTERNATIVE IN
SMALL-CLAIMS ENFORCEMENT (CASE) ACT OF 2019
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, our laws
and rules don’t work unless they work
for everyone. Individuals and small
businesses should have the same
rights—and the same ability to enforce
those rights—as big corporations. I
agree that individual creators are less
likely than Disney or Sony to reap the
full benefits of the copyright system
when their creations are stolen for un-
fair commercial gain. That is a prob-
lem. However, the Copyright Alter-
native in Small-Claims Enforcement
Act (CASE Act) of 2019 is not the right
solution.
The CASE Act would create an
extrajudicial, virtually unappealable
tribunal that could impose statutory
damages of $30,000 on an individual who
posts a couple of memes on social
media, even if the claimant sustained
little or no economic harm. Even the
threat of such a judgment could stifle
the legitimate fair use of content and
be a boon to copyright trolls who har-
ass and threaten innocent internet
users to win settlements. That is a ter-
rible result for freedom of expression,
and it isn’t even the type of activity
the supporters of this bill are trying to
target.
Our copyright system is a careful
balance between protecting our First
Amendment values and ensuring that
authors, photographers, graphic de-
signers, and other creators can protect
their works and earn a living. The
CASE Act does not get the balance
right, and that is why I am placing a
hold on this bill.
For these reasons, I will object to
any unanimous consent agreement to
take up or pass the CASE Act by unan-
imous consent.

DECLARATION OF NATIONAL
EMERGENCY
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, we
are at a crucial point in our democ-
racy, with a big decision to be made.
Tomorrow, we can correct this uncon-
stitutional violation by the President
of the United States of taking military
money, military readiness money, na-
tional security money, and moving it
over for a border wall.
Canceling these 127 projects is not
just a one-off. Let’s remember that. We
all know the President fully intends to
keep at it. It has already been reported
that if the President doesn’t get the $5
billion he has requested for his wall in
2020, the next budget year, the adminis-
tration plans to take another $3.6 bil-
lion from the Pentagon’s construction
budget. This President will not stop
raiding funds we have appropriated, un-
less we stop him and terminate his
sham emergency declaration.
The careful planning for the 127 can-
celed projects contrasts sharply with
the administration’s haphazard rush to
build the President’s wall. The Presi-
dent wants 500 miles of wall before the
2020 election. To do so, the administra-
tion may need to skirt the Federal pro-
curement process and aggressively
take lands away from private land-
owners through eminent domain.
Don’t worry, says the President to
his staff: I will pardon you if you break
any laws.
This is no way to run a government,
and, certainly, no way to spend tax-
payer dollars.
Don’t get me wrong. I support strong
border security. We need well-trained
officers, mobile assets, surveillance
technology, and adequate resources.
But a multibillion dollar wall is waste-
ful, ineffective, and offensive.
Now, I know some in this Chamber
disagree with that opinion. The place
to debate and decide how we spend tax-
payer dollars to keep our border secure
is in the Appropriations Committee, its
various subcommittees, and on the
floor of the Senate. That is what the
Constitution says.
James Madison wrote in Federalist
84: ‘‘An elective despotism was not the
government we fought for; but one in
which the powers of government should
be so divided and balanced . . . that no
one could transcend their legal limits
without being effectually checked and
restrained by the others.’’
It is time for this body to check and
restrain the executive branch. The
President is invading our constitu-
tional prerogative. He is not a despot.
His constitutional powers are limited.
It is up to us to support and defend the
Constitution of the United States, as
we swore an oath to do, and to do the
work we were elected to do.
Madam President, I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.

REMEMBERING MARY GAUTREAUX
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President,
scores and scores of my friends and
neighbors at home in Oregon have been
grieving since they learned the sad
news about the passing of a remarkable
woman, Mary Gautreaux, who died at
her home over the weekend.
Mary Gautreaux was an astounding
bundle of energy and passion. She had
an incandescent smile, a huge heart for
people who didn’t have any power and
clout, and the ability to make just
about everybody she met more opti-
mistic about the policies, opportuni-
ties, for the days ahead.
Mary came to our office back in the
1990s, after working at the U.S. Forest
Service, planting trees and fighting
fires. I can tell you that no resume or
job title could have ever captured what
Mary Gautreaux was all about or how
hard she worked to protect the quali-
ties that make Oregon different—the
very special place she was proud to call
home.
Mary Gautreaux, simply stated, was
an all-star Oregonian. She loved her
family and her coworkers with fierce
loyalty. All of Mary’s friends and
neighbors knew, up close and personal,
what an indomitable force she was. It
didn’t matter where you lived—from
Portland to Burns and everywhere in
between, Democrats, Republicans,
Independents, the left, the right, may-
ors, county officials, everybody liked
being with Mary. They liked working
with Mary. They admired her profes-
sionalism, and they were so impressed
that she always tried to involve every-
body. She always wanted everybody to
believe that they were special, that
they counted. That is something we
will always remember.
My office saw her as an anchor, as I
did personally. For the better part of
two decades, she and I traveled to hun-
dreds of townhalls and community
meetings in every nook and cranny of
our State.
Mary and I always shared a kind of
special joke. At one of these town
meetings, somebody invariably would
ask me something that I didn’t know a
lot about, and I would always say the
same thing. I would say: Folks, I want
you to know I am really digging into
that issue, but Mary Gautreaux is one
of the leading authorities on the sub-
ject.
She would be rolling her eyes. Then I
would say: Well, feel free to call Mary
on nights and weekends. She is always
available for people.
My sense is that she got a kick out of
it the first hundred times I did that. It
was a special kind of bond we had, and
that was vintage Mary Gautreaux.
But the fact is, she really did make
herself available—always, any time,
any day. She was always ready to pick
up the phone and travel the State to
solve a problem.
If I were to talk about all of the ac-
complishments and all of the results
she produced for the people of Oregon,
we would be here until New Year’s Eve
2020. But I do want to talk about a
handful that stand out for their excep-
tional breadth and impact.
Mary Gautreaux was an early advo-
cate of reopening the Willamette River
for the benefit of everybody in Port-
land. She knew it had the potential to
be a treasure for the community. She
was out there swimming every chance
she could get, and she loved every time
she could get out into the Willamette.
But she recognized that not everybody
had her physical abilities. So as was al-
ways her way, when Mary recognized a
problem that needed fixing, she got to
work. She pushed locally with the city
and community activists to get a lad-
der installed at a popular swim spot.
As a result of this kind of effort and,
frankly, her imagination—I don’t know

that finding ladders is always in the
job description, she just figured out
how more people could have the oppor-
tunity to get in and out of the Willam-
ette safely and take a swim in one of
the country’s most impressive urban
rivers.
The whole metropolitan area of my
hometown has her to thank for other
important achievements. We have ex-
ceptional drinking water. Mary was in-
strumental in the creation of Port-
land’s Bull Run water reserve being
still, I believe, the only urban water
source closed to people, entirely, for its
protection. Everybody in Oregon, as
they learn about this—because Mary
never sought any publicity for herself—
really has to thank Mary Gautreaux
for that effort.
She really went to bat for rural Or-
egonians. She recognized, because I
lived in southeast Portland and she
lived in northeast, we loved Portland,
but we didn’t have the job of rep-
resenting the ‘‘state of Portland.’’ Our
job is to get into every nook and cran-
ny of our State, and, particularly,
when so many rural communities are
so hard-hit, Mary would be there, help-
ing small airports, tiny airports get
bigger, helping veterans who couldn’t
get over icy roads to get to healthcare
in the urban areas. She would help,
from food pantries to rural hospitals.
She did everything to make sure that,
in those small communities, they
would understand that they counted.
Sometimes people would point out to
her: A lot of those communities had
more cows than people. I always
thought to myself: I probably didn’t
have the cows with me half the time,
either.
That wasn’t Mary’s measure of public
service. Mary’s measure was to make
sure that nobody was left behind.
One of her recent accomplishments
for rural Oregon is also going to be
treasured for a long time: the designa-
tion of the Frank and Jeanne Moore
Wild Steelhead Special Management
Area.
Frank Moore and Mary had a wonder-
ful bond. Frank is a World War II hero.
After the war, he came home to the
Umpqua River. He has guided genera-
tions of fishing families on the river for
years and years. Now he is 96. Mary
made a judgment a few years ago. She
was concerned that Frank might not
get the designation and recognition he
deserved while he was alive.
Mary basically pushed and pushed
and pushed in order to make sure that
the legislation I just mentioned would
pass and actually get done. What a
wonderful party we had for Frank
Moore. If there was something Mary
Gautreaux loved, it was a good party.
You will hear a little more about that
in just a moment.
On the national level, in southern Or-
egon, Mary’s work on the designation
of the Cascade-Siskiyou National
Monument created unique wilderness
protections, unique protections for
ranchers and environmental folks. It is
something that is going to be a model
for generations to come. She was the
key to the creation of the Badlands
Wilderness. I remember when Mary
Gautreaux pulled it off, people said: Be-
cause of Mary, it was a good day for
the Badlands.
It is a wonderful accomplishment for
folks in Central Oregon. In eastern Or-
egon, Mary’s work on the East
Moraines in the Wallowas was signifi-
cant. She helped Oregonians every-
where, and she always tried to look
ahead. Mary was one of the first who
recognized in our State that recreation
would be a powerful economic engine
for years to come, billions of dollars
coming into the State. There would be
jobs for everybody from kayakers, to
guides, to craft brewers. It was a huge
economic multiplier.
What did we get out of it? We also
got a chance to have a new focus on
recreation. We have seen the creation
of Oregon’s Office of Recreation. It is a
State office borne out of Mary’s tire-
less work, organizing people all over
the State to highlight the 7 Wonders of
Oregon. I am here to say tonight that
Mary Gautreaux, for lots of us, was the
8th Wonder of Oregon.
All of these achievements are part of
her enduring legacy in our State,
places people will visit, lands that are
protected, ranchers, environmentalists.
They are people who, before Mary
showed up, might hardly ever talk to
each other, let alone work together.
She figured out a way to find common
ground and achieve what I have just
described.
I want to talk a little bit about trav-
els with Mary, the laughs that we had
on the long car rides, bouncing around
ideas, occasionally a passionate debate
on something that was important to
Mary. She always recognized—like Pat-
ton, Mary knew that an Army marches
on its stomach. She generously stocked
our car with apples and oranges and
fruits and every manner of snacks—
some healthy, some perhaps not so
healthy—as we drove around Oregon.
Let me tell you something, when
Mary Gautreaux saw hungry folks as
we made our way through the State of
Oregon, what she did along the way is
made sure the car—because she didn’t
want anybody to go hungry—got a
whole lot lighter because she gave
away so much healthy food to hungry
folks who were hurting.
No task seemed trivial or thankless.
I will tell you, when you rode around in
a car with her—and, you know, most of
the time in government, people are
talking about bills and amendments or
polls and the like. What Mary was al-
ways talking about was how it might
be possible to help more people at the
next stop. The key was, at the end of a
trip, she would always say to a person
or two: Give me your phone number. I
want to be able to stay in touch. I want
to check in.
That is the way she was, and some-
times, she would ask them to give her
a name or two of somebody else they
were worried about who had fallen on
hard times—and Mary would reach out
to them.
Another memory I wanted to share is
a little bit raw, and the Senate may
know how it is going to play out in the
months ahead. A few months ago, while
she lay in her hospital bed coming to
terms with a fresh diagnosis of ter-
minal cancer, she learned that a group
of young doctors at the Oregon Health
and Sciences University had been in
training to do a rotation in Ontario,
OR, in Malheur County—a city of 11,000
people, the gateway to the Owyhee
Canyonlands, spectacular high desert
landscapes that were near and dear to
Mary’s heart. But it seemed these
young doctors never got to go outside.
Mary said: We better do something
for all these young doctors. So she
began asking for their supervisor so
she could help these young doctors get
out into the landscape.
I do want people to know that there
is going to be an opportunity to enjoy
that landscape, work in that landscape,
particularly in traditional industries
like agriculture, to a great extent be-
cause of what Mary inspired in
Malheur County. She dedicated her last
days talking to anyone and everyone
who she thought could come together
and help stabilize the small commu-
nity in eastern Oregon.
I want people to be able to picture it
because Nancy and I went to Mary’s
home in northeast Portland over these
last difficult weeks. Mary always man-
aged to cheer us up, rather than vice
versa. One of the things that finally
made us smile—and the hospice folks
nearby—her whole room was built
around the maps of the Owyhee, where
she was looking at places for various
uses that would be appropriate, how to
protect the beauty of this extraor-
dinary part of Oregon.
You would talk to her about the
beauty. She would always say that the
first time she saw it, it brought tears
to her eyes when she viewed it, and she
so wanted to help the ranchers and
folks in that area. She was dedicated to
preserving this part of the world.
It was Mary Gautreaux’s dying wish
that we could make this possible. Many
of my colleagues may have seen me
waiting on the floor of the Senate over
the last few hours. Our chair, Senator
MURKOWSKI, has had a busy schedule
today. When I chaired the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, we
worked very close together. LISA MUR-
KOWSKI has a big heart too. She is al-
ways interested in trying to bring peo-
ple together.
I told Chair MURKOWSKI that, very
shortly, I was going to be introducing
legislation to recognize Mary’s extraor-
dinary work in Malheur County. We
were going to have a community board,
a community board to empower the
ranchers and the small businesses and
the families that had been there for
years and wanted to know that there
was a future. We wanted to call it the

munity Empowerment for Owyhee Act,

or the Mary Gautreaux Malheur Coun-

Stay tuned because you are going to
hear me talk more about Mary’s ex-
traordinary efforts in this regard.
In the meantime, this weekend, we
are going to do what Mary Gautreaux
wanted us to do. We talked to her
about it. We said: Mary, we want to
make sure that we tell Oregon—and in
this case, the country—about your life
and your accomplishments and how
much we loved you.
The way we are going to show her
how much we loved her, this weekend,
we are going to do what she wanted.
We are going to have one heck of a
giant party in her neighborhood, at her
home, in northeast Portland. We are
bringing together friends and family.
She has so many of them.
I am looking down this row. I guess
we broke most of the rules of the Sen-
ate because you are only supposed to
have a couple of people here. As far as
I can tell, the people I am honored to
represent in the U.S. Senate—there are
more than 4 million of them—half of
them would have showed up and sat
with the folks on that row if they could
have.
This weekend, we are going to have a
chance to tell each other stories. We
are going to have a chance to talk
about all of the people Mary helped. I
am working now—because Mary loved
bright colors—to make sure that her
home and everybody there really sees
what she wanted, was a lot of color and
a lot of passion and a lot of friends and
a lot of people talking about what a
special place Oregon is and all these
young people, who have done so much,
are building on her approach for bring-
ing people together, her values of car-
ing, standing up for people who didn’t
have very much and were outside the
power circle of Washington.
This is a hard talk to give, but it is
sure easy to always remember what a
wonderful person Mary Gautreaux was,
how she represented the very best our
State has been able to offer.
I told her privately right before she
died: Mary, we love you. We will al-
ways be thinking of you.
I yield the floor.

CONGRATULATING MR. PATRICK
CERMAK FOR RECEIVING THE
LEWIS UNIVERSITY SIGNUM
FIDEI AWARD
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Mr. Patrick Cermak, President and
Chief Operating Officer of Wight and Com-
pany, for receiving the Lewis University
Signum Fidei Award. The Signum Fidei
Award, meaning ‘‘sign of faith,’’ honors a dis-
tinguished member of the community that em-
bodies the Lasallian mission of faith and serv-
ice to the community.
Throughout his career, Pat has taken on
many roles to help others succeed. Since join-
ing Wight and Company in 2001, he has led
the company’s daily operations and overseen
its financial management. Under his leader-
ship, Wight and Company has experienced
steady growth and instituted numerous initia-
tives including the Wight Sustainability Forum.
The broad base of support for Pat’s leadership
demonstrates his credentials as an effective
leader and his ability to work collaboratively to
build long-term partnerships.
Pat Cermak has always strived to serve oth-
ers unconditionally. He has been deeply in-
volved with the Metropolitan Planning Council
and Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce. His
tireless work has helped ensure that
Chicagoland remains vibrant and sustainable.
In another role, Pat serves as an Executive
Board Member of the Design Futures Council.
His work through this organization continues
to shape the future of the architecture, engi-
neering, and construction industry to benefit
the people that it serves.
But in talking about all that Pat Cermak has
done and achieved, it is essential to mention
that what is most important to him is his faith
and his family, and all who know him know
what a kind and caring man he is.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring
Mr. Patrick Cermak on this tremendous honor.
He is a man who lives out the values of faith
and service to the community in all that he
does. I thank him for his service and wish him
and his family the best.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of the 50-year anniversary
of the El Paso Community College in El Paso,
Texas. Since opening in 1969, El Paso Com-
munity College has provided students with
quality and affordable education.
With 28 students graduating in 1971, the
ELCC has since graduated over 80,000. It
boasts 5 campuses in the El Paso area, in-
cluding its first campus at Fort Bliss Army
Base. The college’s more than 130 distinct
programs give their average of 29,000 enroll-
ees per semester a diverse array of career op-
tions to choose from.
Under President William Serrata, I know El
Paso Community College will continue to
thrive and benefit the members of the El Paso
community for years to come, living true to
their motto as the ‘‘Best Place to Start—and
Finish.’’ I ask my colleagues to join me in
celebrating their 50th anniversary.

HONORING DR. ERIC HOLMES FOR
HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO YORK
CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND
PUBLIC EDUCATION
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor former York City School District
Superintendent Eric Holmes, who retired ear-
lier this year after over thirty years of excep-
tional service with the district.
Beginning as a high school social studies
teacher, Dr. Holmes served in a number of
leadership capacities for the York City School
District, before being named the district’s 14th
superintendent on July 1, 2013.
Dr. Holmes led the district to success during
challenging times, including seeing the district
through a state-mandated financial recovery
plan. The district added a STEAM-science,
technology, engineering, arts and math-acad-
emy through 10th grade and improved its
benchmarks for student achievement.
Following the announcement of his retire-
ment, Dr. Holmes said during an interview
that: ‘‘It’s a team effort, and that’s the only
way we would be able to accomplish our
goals.’’
We know that good teams have great lead-
ers and that is true of Dr. Holmes and his
leadership with the York City School District. I
thank him for his many years of service im-
proving the lives of countless students in York
County.

HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF CHARIS BIBLE COL-
LEGE
HON. DOUG LAMBORN
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to honor the 25th Anniversary of
Charis Bible College. It is nothing short of mi-
raculous to observe the growth that has taken
place within the past quarter-century. Charis
was founded as Colorado Bible College in
1994 and was originally located in Colorado
Springs.
Charis has grown from its first graduating
class of 33 people in 1996, to include 26 cam-
puses in the United States and 22 inter-
national locations. Charis’s main campus has
moved from the Springs to Woodland Park
and is located on a beautiful piece of property
overlooking Pikes Peak.
In my district, the Charis campus provides
multiple programs of Bible-based education in-
cluding a practical government degree. It also
hosts faith-based events throughout the year
with discussions on Christian art, culture, and
politics.
Charis Bible College was created by An-
drew Wommack, who has been a pioneer in
Christian education and ministry. His vision to
have men and women steeped in scripture
has changed countless lives in my district and
around the world.
It was not Andrew’s original plan to create
a college, but he was inspired by 2 Timothy
2:2 which says ‘‘And the things that you have
heard from me among many witnesses, com-
mit these to faithful men who will be able to
teach others also.’’ 25 years after receiving an
answer to his prayer, Andrew is continuing to
innovate and inspire new students.
Charis students and graduates have in-

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Judy Preston of Ronan, for
serving her community and her leadership of
the Bread Basket in Ronan.
An experienced project manager, Judy un-
derstands the importance of building effective

Leadership Montana program which helps en-
hance participants’ leadership skills.
Judy recently concluded her two-year term

nonprofit organization that has provided food
to neighbors in need for more than 30 years.
Under her leadership, the emergency food

Before her departure, The Montana Food
Bank Network presented Judy with the Glacier
Award: For Moving Mountains to End Hunger
for reducing hunger in Montana and promoting
food security through her work with the Ronan
Bread Basket.
As chair of the board, Judy also imple-
mented the BackPack Program in the Ronan
school district. The program provides students
with nutritious foods before weekends and
holidays so they can have proper nutrition
when school is out of session. During her term
as chair, Judy led the fundraising efforts that
enabled over 4,500 meals to be distributed to
students in Ronan.
Madam Speaker, for her leadership of the
Ronan Food Basket and her dedication to
making sure no family or student in Ronan
went hungry, I recognize Judy Preston for her
spirit of Montana.

HONORING IAN PATRICK
SCHWARBER, A TRUE SON OF
AKRON, OH
HON. TIM RYAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor my friend, Ian Patrick Schwarber, who
passed away on September 17, 2019. Ian was
a loving husband, son, brother, uncle, and
friend who devoted his life to creating a vi-
brant and prosperous community for the next
generation.
Ian was born on October 31, 1980, in
Akron, Ohio to Donald and Patricia
Schwarber. Ian attended St. Vincent de Paul
Catholic Primary School and graduated from
Archbishop Hoban High School. During his
time at Hoban, Ian was a multi-sport athlete,
lettering in both football and baseball. Ian was
involved in a severe accident that damaged
his leg and left him bedridden for nearly a
year. Ian’s strong faith and his perseverance—
two of his most defining characteristics—
brought him through this time and would ulti-
mately guide the course of his life.
Upon graduation from Hoban, Ian left Akron
to attend the University of Charleston where
his passion for music and songwriting mani-
fested itself into his band Blue Flashing Light.
Along with his brother, Joshua, and his
bandmates, Ian shared his talent and gifts with
the world. Ian would later return to his home-
town to finish college and earn his master’s
degree in Applied Politics from the University
of Akron. Anyone who knew Ian recognized
his brilliant light and his unwavering commit-
ment to serving others. Whether it was his in-
volvement with community nonprofit organiza-
tions like Project Learn Summit County and
the Autism Society of Greater Akron, or to
broader issues like expanding STEM opportu-
nities to underserved youth and entrepreneur-
ship, Ian gave one thousand percent of his
time, energy, and talent.
Ian is most known for his entrepreneurial
and innovative spirit that drove him into his
next venture as the co-founder of the Univer-
sity of Akron’s EXL Center, an initiative de-
signed to help students emerge as civically-
engaged, adaptable leaders, ready to join in
the enterprise of building strong and sustain-
able communities. After launching the EXL
center, Ian transitioned into the IT landscape,
becoming the Chief Strategy Officer and a co-
owner of DriveIT, a Tech-centric adult training
center. Ian would later become Executive Vice
President and Chief Strategy Officer at Akron-
based IT services company CenterLink Tech-
nologies. Aside from his professional contribu-
tions, Ian was most proud of the family he cre-
ated with his wife, Mackenzie Justice. Their
children, Mary Justice and Jack, were the
most precious gifts in his life.
Madam Speaker, Ian Schwarber was a true
son of Akron. He was relentless in the pro-
motion of any effort to amplify Akron and was
a wellspring of ideas to move the community
forward. Ian was willing to work with anyone to
see a dream grow wings and take flight. May
we all redouble our own efforts to love and
serve others the way Ian so generously did
during his life.

SIMPLE FAFSA ACT
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO
SABLAN
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Simple FAFSA Act.
Because today FAFSA, the Free Application
for Federal Student Aid, is anything but sim-
ple.
In fact, the 108-question application can be
so daunting that as many as 40 percent of
students and parents simply cannot complete
it.
And that means they cannot get the help
they need to make college more affordable,
even though we have money available for
them.
In fact, $2.6 billion went unclaimed for the
2018–2019 academic year.
So, let us do something to help these stu-
dents and their families.
The Simple FAFSA Act reduces the number
of supporting documents and many of the
questions on the current FAFSA.
Verifying income will be much easier as par-
ents will be able to retrieve and use the pre-
vious year’s income data when applying under
the bill.
Low-income students and families—like
many in the Marianas—just need to file the
FAFSA once, as opposed to annually, to auto-
matically qualify for a full Pell Grant and at-
tend Northern Marianas College debt-free.
The process is even faster for families re-
ceiving a means-tested benefit, like Medicaid,
who will be able to skip all financial questions
on the form.
And the legislation opens FAFSA to
DREAMers and students with prior drug of-
fenses so our country can fully benefit from
their potential.
By simplifying the FAFSA, we help more
students and their families receive the aid they
need to succeed in their education and future
careers.
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion to make college more accessible and af-
fordable for all Americans.
RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT
OF JANE DIFLEY FROM THE SO-
CIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF
NH FORESTS
HON. ANN M. KUSTER
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jane Difley
on the event of her retirement as President of
the Society for the Protection of New Hamp-
shire Forests.
A licensed forester, Jane’s esteemed career
included time at the American Forest Founda-
tion and the Vermont Natural Resources
Council before joining the Society for the Pro-
tection of New Hampshire Forests in 1996. In
addition, Jane was the first woman elected to
serve as the President of the Society of Amer-
ican Foresters. During her 23 years with the
Forest Society, Jane has been a tireless advo-
cate for land conservation in the Granite State.
At the helm of the Forest Society, Jane suc-
cessfully heightened the pace of land con-
servation efforts in the face of increasing de-
velopment. Under her direction, the Forest So-
ciety more than doubled the size of its con-
served Forest Reservations to 56,000 acres
and played a role in the conservation of over
290,000 acres overall. She advocated for the
important role of Granite State forests in com-
munity recreation, wildlife habitat, and environ-
mental health.
The important work accomplished during
Jane’s tenure at the Forest Society will serve
as an enduring testament to her commitment
to New Hampshire’s forests. On behalf of my
constituents in New Hampshire’s Second Con-
gressional District, I thank Jane for her service
and wish her the best of luck in her new chap-
ter.

BOWIE STATE UNIVERSITY DR.
SAMUEL L. MYERS, SR.
HON. STENY H. HOYER
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to ex-
press my heartfelt congratulations to Dr. Sam-
uel L. Myers, Sr. on reaching his milestone
centennial birthday this past April 18, which is
being celebrated on September 27 at a gath-
ering of friends, family, and community and
national leaders at National Harbor in Mary-
land. From speaking out against segregation
in the military as an Army captain during the
Second World War to becoming one of the
first African Americans to earn a doctorate in
economics from Harvard University, from his
efforts as part of the Civil Rights Movement to
expand access to higher education to his
championing of Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCU) for more than half a cen-
tury, Dr. Myers’ life has been one of blazing
trails and breaking down barriers.
In 1967, Dr. Myers assumed the position of
President of Bowie State University, the oldest
HBUC in Maryland and one of the oldest in
the country. Under his administration, enroll-
ment increased 200 percent and tensions be-
tween the student body and officials were

calmed by his skilled diplomacy and deter-
mination to ensure that high-quality education
always came first. After ten years at Bowie
State, Dr. Myers began an eighteen-year ten-
ure as President of the National Association
for Equal Opportunity (NAFEO). Representing
117 HBCUs, Dr. Myers fought tirelessly to se-
cure much-needed funding for these colleges
and universities to expand and offer more
courses and degrees. I am proud, Madam
Speaker, to be a member of the Congres-
sional HBCU Caucus and to support Bowie
State University and other HBCUs as they
work hard to carry out their important mission
of making educational achievement and career
success more equitable in our country.
Even after his retirement from NAFEO, Dr.
Myers has been a force for good in the com-
munity, working since 1995 as Chairman of
the Board of Directors of Minority Access, Inc.,
an organization that works to expand the ac-
cess of under-represented groups to institu-
tions of higher education, federal and state
governments, and private corporations. Dr.
Myers has spent decades fighting for the pub-
lic good, for equality, for justice, and for oppor-
tunity. His impact on education in my home
state of Maryland and in our country cannot
be measured and will surely be long-lasting. I
hope my colleagues will join me in thanking
Dr. Myers for his lifetime of service and wish-
ing him a very happy 100th birthday.

RECOGNIZING THE NAMING OF
THE VERMONT AVENUE EXIT ON
STATE HIGHWAY ROUTE 10 IN
HONOR OF THE EL SALVADOR
COMMUNITY CORRIDOR
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the El Salvador Community Corridor
(Corridor), the first designated Salvadoran
community in the City of Los Angeles.
This vibrant Corridor, located in the Pico
Union area in the southern region of down-
town Los Angeles, honors the rich history, her-
itage and contributions of the Salvadoran
American community. Murals throughout the
Corridor depict the cultural pride, struggles
and dreams of Salvadoran Americans.
Forty years of internal political turmoil forced
individuals from the Republic of El Salvador to
flee the country and seek peace and security
in the United States. Today, it is estimated
that nearly one million Salvadorans reside in
Los Angeles, making Los Angeles home to the
largest population of Salvadorans outside of El
Salvador.
You cannot tell the story of Los Angeles
without telling the stories of the Salvadoran
American community—and of the community
leaders, public servants, artists, teachers,
neighbors, family members and friends who
enrich Los Angeles in countless ways.
In 2012, the City of Los Angeles declared a
section of Vermont Avenue as the El Salvador
Community Corridor, a long over due recogni-
tion of the economic and cultural contributions
of Salvadoran American individuals, families,
and organizations. This designation—an im-
portant step for the community—created a
special place for residents to celebrate their
culture through businesses, retail, colorful art,
food, clothing, and traditions.
This year, we celebrate the naming of the
Vermont Avenue exit on State Highway 10 in
honor of the Corridor. Another important step
in honoring the integral role of the Salvadoran
American community in the economy, culture
and identity of Los Angeles.
I ask all Members to join me in commending
the countless contributions of the Salvadoran
American community to Los Angeles and rec-
ognizing integral economic and cultural role of
the El Salvador Community Corridor.

IN RECOGNITION OF ALBERT N.
BULLOCK, POSTHUMOUSLY
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Albert N. Bullock ‘‘Al’’ who passed away
at the age of 96 on August 16, 2019 in Daly
City after a remarkable life. Al was an
unflappable photographer who filmed the at-
tack on Pearl Harbor and covered many
events that shaped the Bay Area, including
the Patti Hearst kidnapping, the assassina-
tions of Mayor Moscone and Harvey Milk and
the Jonestown mass murder where I met him.
He will always have a special place in my
heart.
Al was born in Utica, New York on March 5,
1923. He joined the U.S. Navy at age 17
which changed his life. His first job was wash-
ing airplanes and working in a photo lab
where he discovered his talent and love for
taking pictures. When a place in the Navy
photography school opened, he was picked
and received what he called the best edu-
cation possible in photography, motion pic-
tures and navigation. He graduated as a sec-
ond class photographer’s mate and was im-
mediately hired by the government. He was
shipped to Pearl Harbor and as fate would
have it, the year was 1941. On December 7th,
Al was on Ford Island and as the Japanese
were dropping bombs right on top of him, he
filmed the carnage with a hand-cranked 16mm
camera. Ford Island was the strategic center
of operations for the U.S. Navy in the Pacific,
the location of Battleship Row. Assigned as a
flag cameraman on the USS Santa Fe, he
spent the entire war moving from one cam-
paign to the next. In March 1945, he shot his-
toric photos and footage of the burning and
listing USS Franklin 50 miles off the coast of
Japan. The USS Santa Fe rescued many sail-
ors and helped put out the fires on the Frank-
lin. Al was 22.
In 1950, Al moved to San Mateo in my Con-
gressional District and held a variety of jobs
selling China and silverware, taking photos
and filming car races. One day in the 60s, he
was filming a race that ended in a fiery crash.
Roger Grimsby, an anchor and the news di-
rector at KGO–TV, watched him as he kept
filming. He approached Al asking, ‘‘You have
any blood in your veins?’’ He bought the foot-
age for $25 and used it on the air that day.
Thus began Al’s pursuit to become a camera-
man for KGO. In 1962, Grimsby, known as
‘‘Grim Grimsby’’ for his gruff no-nonsense de-
livery of the news, finally relented and hired
him. Al stayed at KGO for 30 years covering
the John F. Kennedy assassination, the Viet-
nam War, the birth of the free speech move-
ment, the kidnapping of newspaper heiress
Patricia Hearst, and the Loma Prieta earth-
quake.
He also covered a story that shaped my life
and cemented my commitment to public serv-
ice. Al flew to Guyana with my mentor and
boss Congressman Ryan who took a delega-
tion there to investigate the commune Jim
Jones had built in Jonestown. Relatives and
friends of Jones’ followers suspected that he
was holding them against their will. They were
right and some 40 followers were ready to de-
fect with our delegation. What unfolded was
one of the deadliest mass murders in history.
Congressman Ryan was assassinated on the
airstrip in Port Kaituma, shot 45 times. Three
journalists and one defector were shot dead. I
was shot five times, left for dead but survived.
In the commune, more than 900 followers
were murdered with cyanide-laced Kool-Aid. Al
was on a plane back to the Bay Area. Upon
hearing the news he immediately returned to
Guyana to cover the aftermath. Just nine days
later, back in San Francisco, Al was sent to
cover the assassinations of Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. He wit-
nessed and captured one of the most tumul-
tuous and trying periods in Bay Area history.
Al’s superb work was recognized with many
awards including the California Press Photog-
rapher of the Year and the prestigious Silver
Circle of the National Academy of TV Arts and
Sciences in 2003.
Al Bullock is preceded in death by his ex-
wife Edythe and survived by their three chil-
dren, Candace, Bob and Georgette, their six
grandchildren, Stephanie, Lindsey, Sean, Erin,
Matthew, and four great-grandchildren, Kelly,
Katie, Tyler and Adam.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to rise with me to honor Albert N.
Bullock who served our country and led by ex-
ample. He was a devoted husband, father,
grandfather and great-grandfather, a mentor to
many, Mr. KGO to his colleagues, and one of
a kind. He will be deeply missed.

Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker,
it’s my honor to recognize Max Disposti,
founder of the North County LGBTQ Resource
Center, as my next Constituent of the Month.
A longtime North County resident, Max’s tire-
less work to open the Center filled a void in
support services and resources for LGBTQ
families and has made a positive impact on
countless lives in our community.
Before Max founded the Center in 2011,
many lesbian, gay, transgender, bisexual, and
questioning youth and families had nowhere to
turn in North County, lacking a sense of com-
munity that was desperately needed. With the
help of others in the community like Maria Al
Shamma, who now serves as Board Chair for
the Center, Max is able to provide our LGBTQ
neighbors with a safe place to receive re-
sources and feel more comfortable in their
community. Max and many others at the Cen-
ter provide critical services such as support

groups for youth, seniors, and military service
members, HIV and AIDS testing and preven-
tion, counseling and assistance with housing
and meals. They also provide civil rights advo-
cacy, classes, and workgroups.
Ultimately, one of the most significant bene-
fits of the Resource Center is its ability to
make the LGBTQ community more visible in
North County. Everyone in our community
should feel safe and welcome. Unfortunately,
that has not always been the experience of
our LGBTQ neighbors. There is much more
that we need to do to ensure that LGBTQ indi-
viduals have the same rights and protections
as anyone else. That’s why I was proud to
help introduce and pass the Equality Act to fi-
nally, fully end discrimination against LGBTQ
Americans. I’m proud to stand with Max and
so many others in North County’s LGBTQ
community in fighting for equality.
I launched a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize individuals who have gone
above and beyond to make our region a
stronger place for everyone to live and thrive.
Max’s contributions to our community are ex-
traordinary, but I also want to recognize every-
one else who helped launch the North County
LGBTQ Resource Center and work to keep its
doors open every single day. I thank them for
everything they have done and will continue to
do for the community.

RECOGNIZING ST. PETER LU-
THERAN CHURCH FOR ITS 150
YEARS AS A CONGREGATION
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
acknowledge the St. Peter Lutheran Church
for 150 years of unfaltering service to its com-
munity. The church began in 1869 with a con-
gregation of 26; the growing number of
attendees quickly surpassed the capacity of
the small church, and a new building was con-
structed across the street. In 1894, a commu-
nity formed around the church, which became
known as the town of Saint Peter. In 1971 a
parochial school was added to the church
grounds which still operates today.
To celebrate this historic occasion, the
church will be holding honorary services dedi-
cated to the anniversary on Sunday, Novem-
ber 10, 2019, at 9 AM. Immediately after the
service there will be a presentation of the
church’s history, featuring memorabilia col-
lected throughout the last 150 years.
I extend my well wishes to Reverend Ryan
Meyer, the congregation, and the church anni-
versary committee as they celebrate this excit-
ing event.
Madam Speaker, I would like to congratu-
late the St. Peter Lutheran Church and their
entire congregation for their service and com-
mitment to their community and to their faith
throughout the past 150 years. I look forward
to seeing the Saint Peter Lutheran Church
continue to prosper.

today to congratulate the Farmer’s Daughters’
Drive-In for 50 years of business in Saratoga
Springs, NY.
Farmer’s Daughters’ was founded in 1969
by Mr. Eddie Winslow and was run by his
daughter Glenda Clausen and her husband
Tom until 2006. It was then that Annette
Osher bought the community staple. Ms.
Osher has kept the community favorite alive
and well. Small businesses like Farmer’s
Daughters’ form the backbone of our North
Country communities. They generate employ-
ment and job creation, while driving invest-
ment. Beyond that, small businesses become
a part of the social fabric that makes our com-
munities unique. Most small businesses sur-
vive fewer than five years so the 50th anniver-
sary of a business is a momentous achieve-
ment.
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional
District, I want to congratulate Annette Osher
for reaching to this milestone. Annette is a
great example of the entrepreneurial and com-
munity spirit that defines New York’s 21st Dis-
trict. I look forward to her continued success.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RAY
GREEN
HON. DARIN LaHOOD
OF ILLINOIS

Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like
to honor and remember the life of Ray Green,
who passed away on August 7, 2019, at age
91.
Born in Cascade, Iowa in 1927, Ray dis-
played a natural gravitation towards leader-
ship. Ray Green began his studies at my alma
matter, Loras College, in Dubuque, Iowa. Not
long after he started his education at Loras,
Ray left to serve in the United States Army,
where he fought in Italy during World War II.
After returning from war, Ray finished his
schooling and went on to start his long career
in the automotive industry.
While working in auto sales, Ray advanced
quickly at every stop that he made. In 1964,
Ray Green was able to purchase his first car
dealership in Monmouth, Illinois. Over the
years, Ray owned and managed several car
dealerships throughout Central Illinois. Ray
also worked to improve his industry by serving
as a director on many national auto retailer
boards. All of Ray’s hard work cemented his
place as an inductee into the Automotive Hall
of Fame.
Ray Green was a small and cunning busi-
nessman, but he was also known for his gen-
erosity and community service. He was heav-
ily involved with the Knights of Columbus, Ro-
tary Club, and the America Legion. Ray was
also known for supporting those seeking a
Catholic education. He helped to raise millions
of dollars for Loras College and Routt Catholic
High School, in Jacksonville, Illinois.
We mourn the passing of Ray Green, a
friend and hero to many. He left a lasting im-
pact on those who had the pleasure of know-
ing him.

Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor and pay tribute to an individual
whose dedication and contributions to our re-
gion have been exceptional. After serving ten
years on the Murrieta City Council, my good
friend Randon Lane recently stepped down to
take a position with the U.S. Department of
Transportation, here in Washington, D.C.
After graduating from college, Randon
began a career in business working for For-
tune 500 companies including AT&T
Broadband, Nextel and Sprint. Until recently,
Randon served as a Public Affairs Manager
for The Southern California Gas Company, the
largest natural gas provider in the nation. In
addition to his business career, Randon has
long been active in public service. In 2003, he
was appointed to the Murrieta Planning Com-
mission. In the following years Murrieta wit-
nessed an incredible 70 percent population
explosion, one of the largest population in-
creases in the nation during that period.
In 2008 Randon was elected to the Murrieta
City Council. While successfully leading
Murrieta as Mayor in 2011 and 2016, he along
with the City Council continued to prioritize in-
vestments in infrastructure and public safety.
Forbes named Murrieta the No. 1 post-reces-
sion ‘‘boom town’’ in America and FBI statis-
tics rank Murrieta the third safest city in the
Nation among cities with populations over
100,000 residents. Randon’s strong leadership
led his council colleagues to appoint him to
represent them on agencies locally, regionally,
statewide and nationally. Randon and his wife,
Bridget ‘‘Bo’’, have been married for 21 years,
17 of those in Murrieta. Together they have a

HON. DWIGHT EVANS
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Archbishop Mary Floyd Palmer, affec-
tionately known as Bishop Mary. On March
16, 2019, Bishop Mary was installed as the
first woman Presiding Prelate of the Philadel-
phia Council of Clergy, Inc.
The Philadelphia Council of Clergy, Inc. is a
non-profit organization founded in 1994 as an
ecumenical group of multi-cultural faith-based
leaders who desire to alleviate suffering, over-
come oppression and foster justice and peace,
not only in Philadelphia but in all communities
nationwide.
Bishop Mary is the eldest daughter of Rev.
Dr. Melvin and the late Mrs. Elizabeth Floyd.
Bishop Mary is a graduate of the Philadelphia
High School for Girls and has obtained a Doc-
tor of Ministry. In July 2009, Bishop Mary was
ordained and consecrated to the Episcopal Of-
fice of Bishop in Atlanta, Georgia. In May
2011, Bishop Mary was selected by the Phila-
delphia Chapter of the National Congress of
Black Women to receive their prestigious
‘‘Woman of the Year in Ministry’’ award.
In 2006, Bishop Mary entered full-time min-
istry as a Motivational Speaker. She is pas-
sionate about prison ministries and she serves
as a volunteer instructor teaching a weekly
Reality Life Skills Class for male inmates since
1988. In October 2011, she became Founder
and Pastor of The Samaritan Temple, a place
where hope exists. Bishop Mary serves as the
Corresponding Secretary for the National Con-
gress of Black Women, Philadelphia Chapter
and actively serves in several capacities on
several committees.
On behalf of the 3rd Congressional District
of Pennsylvania, I am pleased to offer my sin-
cere congratulations to Archbishop Mary Floyd
Palmer in achieving this historic appointment
as the first woman Presiding Prelate of the
Philadelphia Council of Clergy, Inc.

HONORING DR. MICHAEL
CHERINGTON
HON. KEN BUCK
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and celebrate Dr. Michael Cherington
for his 85th birthday.
Dr. Michael Cherington of Castle Rock, Col-
orado was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in
1934. He graduated from the University of
Pittsburgh and later attended the University of
Pittsburg School of Medicine. As such, he was
destined to continue his career on the East
Coast until a mentor directed him to take a
year for residency. Shortly thereafter, he
moved to Colorado Springs with his first wife,
and that same year, he was drafted into the
United States Army.
While in Colorado, Dr. Cherington opened
his own private practice in neurology and he
taught at the University of Colorado Medical
School. He served his community very well in
both capacities while helping thousands of pa-
tients across the state. He most notably cared
for patients with varying degrees of neuro-
logical damage from lighting strikes. As a mat-
ter of fact, towards the end of his practice, he
wrote an article about lightning strikes and the
injuries they can cause, and it was published
in ‘‘SportsMedicine.’’
Later, he became known as ‘‘The Lightning
Doctor’’ after publishing many articles about
lightning injuries and how to avoid such inju-
ries. This eventually led to the creation of the
Lightning Data Center in Denver, which
brought together many lightning experts
across several different areas of expertise and
discipline. As ‘‘The Lighting Doctor,’’ he was
featured on many local television stations, as
well as, ABC’s 20/20, National Geographic,
and Unsolved Mysteries.
To this day, Dr. Cherington still lives happily
in Colorado, almost sixty years later. In his
spare time, he greatly enjoys spending time
with his wife Nancy, his children, and nine
grandchildren. I would like to thank Dr.
Cherington for all his contributions and wish
him a very Happy Birthday.

CONGRATULATING INDIANA HIGH
SCHOOL PRINCIPAL OF THE
YEAR BRUCE D. JENNINGS
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Bruce D. Jennings on
being named the 2018 Indiana High School
Principal of the Year.
Annually since 1992, the Indiana Associa-
tion of School Principals has recognized out-
standing principals across our great state of
Indiana. In his 12 years as principal at Bremen
High School, Mr. Jennings has truly been an
extraordinary educator, and it is clear this high
honor is well-deserved. However, his impact
goes far beyond the walls of Bremen High
School.
In addition to his role as principal, Mr. Jen-
nings has served his community in compas-
sionate and philanthropic ways that have
helped to advance educational opportunities
for the next generation. As a member and ad-
visor of organizations like the Marshall County
Community Foundation, the Bremen Dollars
for Scholars Organization, and Indiana Univer-
sity’s Educational Leadership Program, Mr.
Jennings works hard to build a bright future for
Hoosier students and lead by example for
educators across the country. His record of
leadership and dedication reflects positively on
Bremen High School and the northern Indiana
community, and I am grateful for his innova-
tive ideas that promote creativity, confidence,
and discovery.
Mr. Jennings’ ability to connect with stu-
dents and teachers and share his passion for
learning empowers everyone at Bremen High
School to reach the next level of success. He
is a true inspiration and valuable role model to
us all, and I have no doubt Bremen students
are well-equipped for whatever their futures
may hold.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of 2nd District
Hoosiers, I want to thank Bruce Jennings for
all he has done to educate, guide, and support
his students and faculty. It is a privilege to
represent principals like Mr. Jennings who
help make our schools vibrant and our stu-
dents’ futures bright.

CELEBRATING THE 200TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE OLD
MCKENDREE CHAPEL
HON. JASON SMITH
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the Old McKendree Chapel
in Jackson, Missouri on the occasion of its bi-
centennial. The Old McKendree Chapel was
built in 1819 and held their first services on
September 14th, a year and a half before Mis-
souri was granted statehood.
The chapel was constructed by Methodist
pioneers, who had been meeting at the site
since 1809. It was named for the circuit-riding
preacher, William McKendree, who visited the
congregation in 1818. McKendree went on to
become the first native-born bishop of the
Methodist Church in the United States. The
chapel was actively used until 1888. By the
1920s, the chapel was in disrepair and faced
the threat of demolition.
Through the efforts of Rev. William Stewart,
then pastor of New McKendree Church in
Jackson, the historic chapel was saved. Res-
toration was completed in 1933 and the
McKendree Chapel Memorial Association was
founded to preserve the landmark for the en-
joyment of future generations.
Today the chapel continues to serve as a
holy place in the community. It is a national
Methodist shrine visited by families from
across the country each year.
For its contributions to the Jackson commu-
nity and its place in Missouri history, it is my
great pleasure to celebrate the Old
McKendree Chapel today before the U.S.
House of Representatives.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL
DUMPLING DAY
HON. NYDIA M. VELÁZQUEZ
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor National Dumpling Day. Na-
tional Dumpling Day was inaugurated back in
2015 in Brooklyn, NY and is now celebrated
across America every year on September 26.
Dumplings made their humble beginnings in
Ancient China, almost 1,800 years ago, where
they were known as jiaozi. In America, dump-
lings were introduced in the mid-1800s by Chi-
nese laborers building the transcontinental rail-
road. From Korean mandu and Chinese soup
dumplings, to the Indian samosa and Tibetan
momo, dumplings have become a world deli-
cacy and bear tremendous cultural signifi-
cance in our Asian Pacific American commu-
nities. Today, families come together across
our country to the table to wrap, cook and
enjoy this delightful treasure.
In the 7th Congressional District of New
York, we are proud to have CJ TMI Foods, a
part of CJ America, as one of the country’s
largest dumpling manufacturers and the found-
er of National Dumpling Day. Since 1989, CJ
TMI Foods has been a minority-owned busi-
ness, creating fresh and tasty dumplings and
noodles. The company has grown exponen-
tially over the years by expanding into new fa-
cilities and employing over 400 people. I ad-
mire their trailblazing mission of connecting
and inspiring individuals of all cultural identi-
ties through exposure to Asian food.
Dumplings are more than just delicious
comfort food, they are a bonding experience
among many of our families. I ask my col-
leagues in the 116th Congress to join me in
celebrating National Dumpling Day and recog-
nizing the value these ubiquitous and delicious
pockets of dough carry, unifying neighbors
and sparking joy.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE BUDDHIST
CHURCH OF FLORIN
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, it is with de-
light that I rise to honor the 1OOth Anniver-
sary of the Buddhist Church of Florin as the
congregation and greater community gathers
for this historic occasion. This historical
Church has served as the heart of the Florin
Japanese-American community and a hub for
social and religious gatherings alike.
In the 1890’s, the Issei arrived in Florin and
thrived in our region. In 1919, a few decades
after the Issei’s arrival, Japanese-American
strawberry and grape farmers from Florin,
Mayhew, and Elk Grove gathered to form the
Buddhist Church of Florin. Tragically, World
War II brought turmoil to our community and
the church with Executive Order 9066. Be-
cause of the order of the relocation of all per-
sons of Japanese ancestry, the church was
locked and not in use until residents returned
to the region after release.
Since the return of the congregation, the
Buddhist Church of Florin has flourished and
is now dedicated to sharing the wisdom and
compassion of the Buddhist teachings, re-
membering the history of the Issei and Florin,
and most importantly, provide a space for the
community to connect. The Church provides
social and cultural events, monthly low-cost
lunches for seniors, and youth athletics such
as basketball and martial arts.
Madam Speaker, as Florin residents and the
greater community gather to celebrate this
momentous day, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the 100th Anniversary of the
Buddhist Church of Florin.

Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise today

munity. During his time in human services, Jim
worked as the former Director of the Adult

he implemented and chaired the Adult Com-
munity Resource and Coordination Group, the
North Texas Behavioral Health Authority Pro-
vider Advisory Council, and the Collin County

Most recently, Jim has served as the Chief

Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor and celebrate Dr. Lewis
Squires, a West Michigan resident who was
recently named Chiropractor of the year by the
Michigan Association of Chiropractors.
This prestigious award perfectly captures
Dr. Squires’ 41 years of leadership, service,
and dedication to Communities in West Michi-
gan and beyond. Through his outstanding
work, Dr. Squires has improved the lives of
countless Michiganders, reducing chronic pain,
providing rehabilitative care, and encouraging
a holistic approach to one’s well-being.
Dr. Squires has dedicated his life to ele-
vating the chiropractic profession, both directly
to people and within the health care industry
itself. He has played a crucial role in unifying
chiropractors across Michigan, where his lead-
ership earned him a spot on the Michigan As-
sociation of Chiropractors Board of Directors.
Receiving the Chiropractor of the Year
award is the culmination of numerous recogni-
tions that Dr. Squires has earned. Dr. Squires
has also been presented with the Outstanding

LILLIAN STEWART
HON. BARBARA LEE
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life and legacy of Ms.
Lillian Stewart and to extend my deepest con-
dolences to her family upon her passing at the
blessed age of 95. Ms. Stewart was a devoted
mother, grandmother, and community activist.
I am also privileged to have been able to call
Ms. Stewart my friend.
Born in Mecklenberg County, North Caro-
lina, in 1923, Ms. Stewart was born the middle
of five children. She spent her formative years
in Washington, D.C., where she attended Gar-
net-Patterson Junior High School and Cardoza
High School.
After graduating from high school, Ms.
Stewart went on to continue her education,
completing a post-graduate course in Cosme-
tology at Madame CJ Walker’s College of
Beauty Culture; a foreign language course at
the University of the District of Columbia; and
medical secretary training by the District of
Columbia Medical Society; and earning a
Montgomery Ward Consumer Education ‘‘Art
of Interior Decorating Home Fashion Forum’’
certificate.
Ms. Stewart spent much of her professional
career at Howard University Hospital, where
she served in several support and junior man-
agement positions. She retired from the hos-
pital as Hospital Utilization Review Coordi-
nator. Upon retirement, Ms. Stewart dedicated
her time to a range of community activities
and small business ventures. She was active
in the AARP Shepherd Park Chapter No.
2667, chair of the Southwest Advisory Coun-
cil-Southwest Health Clinic and was a DC
Public Notary. Ms. Stewart was also an out-
spoken activist. She actively protested the
planned closure of DC General Hospital, lo-
cated in a predominately African American
neighborhood, in 2001.
As a mother, Ms. Stewart encouraged a
pursuit of education in her children. She was
privileged to live to witness her three chil-
dren’s professional accomplishments in com-
munications, medicine, and photography. She
also leaves behind six grandchildren and six
great-grandchildren.
On a personal note, I had the honor of
spending private time with Ms. Stewart thanks
to her loving son Dwight who has been a dear
friend for decades. I loved being with her. She
brought me joy and made me laugh. Her
colorful descriptions and deep insights were
remarkable. I attended mass with her on sev-
eral occasions and she demonstrated in words
and deeds her belief in God, who she knew
was all merciful and loving. I will deeply miss
Ms. Stewart, but her indomitable spirit will en-
dure forever.
Today, I join Ms. Stewart’s family in cele-
brating her life and enduring legacy. May she
rest in power and in peace.

BLACKWELL
HON. MARK MEADOWS
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and service of Helen
Blackwell. Mrs. Blackwell was a tireless cham-
pion for conservative principles.
Mrs. Blackwell served as the Virginia State
Chairman of Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagle Forum for
25 years. She was also the director of the Vir-
ginia Conservative Alliance and the Voting In-
tegrity Project, of which she was the original
chairman. A dedicated political activist, Mrs.
Blackwell was elected chairman of the Arling-
ton County, Virginia Republican Committee
three times and was the Republican captain of
the Lyon Village precinct in Arlington for 41
years. She served on the State Central Com-
mittee of the Republican Party of Virginia and
was a Delegate from Virginia to the 2008 Re-
publican National Convention.
Mrs. Blackwell was born in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana. She attended one year at Ran-
dolph-Macon Womans College and received
her B.A. in History of Art and M.B.A. from Lou-
isiana State University, where she was the co-
founder and secretary of Students for Con-
servative Government. She was a volunteer
docent for many years at the National Gallery
of Art.
Since 1972, Mrs. Blackwell resided with her
family in Arlington, Virginia. She was a be-
loved wife, mother, and grandmother who
lived out her conservative principles every day
of her life. Mrs. Blackwell was an active mem-
ber of Columbia Baptist Church in Falls
Church and the Eleanor Wilson Chapter of the
Daughters of the American Revolution.
Her activism has left an indelible impact on
the conservative movement, and she leaves a
legacy of dedication, kindness, and boldness
for years to come. Helen Blackwell will be
dearly missed by many in this Chamber.

IN HONOR OF ERIC LARSON’S
SERVICE TO THE SAN DIEGO
COUNTY FARM BUREAU
HON. DUNCAN HUNTER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, the success
of any organization is entirely dependent upon
its leadership. The San Diego County Farm
Bureau (SDCFB) is a strong and effective ad-
vocate for our local agriculture industry, not
only in San Diego County, but throughout Cali-
fornia. At the helm for the past 23 years has
been Eric Larson as its Executive Director.
Eric recently announced his retirement from
this position and I rise today and ask the
House to join me in thanking him for his dedi-
cated service and in congratulating him on this
new chapter in his life.
Like many young people, Eric was first intro-
duced to agriculture in school as a member of
the Encinitas 4–H Club and San Dieguito High
School Chapter of the Future Farmers of
America. This would lead to a 48-year career
that included everything from cut flower and
nursery crop production to serving as General
Manager of the California Floriculture Growers
Association for 13 years to eventually leading
the SDCFB.
Eric’s standing in the agriculture industry
grew with his positions on the Board of Direc-
tors with the Living Plant Growers Association,
the San Diego County Flower and Plant Asso-
ciation, and the San Diego County Water Au-
thority. Simultaneously, dedication to local

community was also an important aspect to
Eric’s character where he served the City of
Carlsbad as a Parks & Recreation Commis-
sioner, Planning Commissioner and twice
being elected to the City Council.
For over 100 years, the SDCFB has suc-
cessfully championed our local agriculture in-
dustry and Eric came to the Bureau in 1996
immediately continuing this legacy of leader-
ship. During Eric’s tenure as Executive Direc-
tor, the SDCFB was honored as the California
Farm Bureau ‘‘County of the Year’’ three
times, successfully relocated and acquired in-
come property, launched San Diego Grown
magazine, established the San Diego Farm &
Nursery Expo, kept members informed on all
important issues, defeated two countywide
ballot measures opposed by farmers, shielded
farmers from the State of California’s drought
water use restrictions, created the San Diego
Regional Irrigated Lands Group, initiated stra-
tegic planning to better serve members, and
elevated the standing of local farmers and the
Farm Bureau in the eyes of elected officials,
regulatory agencies and the public as a whole.
Eric’s strong reputation of mastering com-
plex issues and helping create successful
strategies toward achieving goals is well-
earned. On many occasions, my office has
used Eric as a resource to not only ensure we
had a full understanding of matters affecting
our agriculture community, but to also help us
effectively communicate on a broad range of
policy issues. Eric’s retirement is well-de-
served and, while he will definitely be missed,
I am confident Eric’s leadership and advocacy
will continue in new and exciting ways.

IN RECOGNITION OF EDDIE
AGUERO
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, today I rise
to honor the service Eddie Aguero has pro-
vided to the residents of the State of California
and to our nation. Today, Mr. Aguero is being
recognized for his twenty-five years of service
to California Volunteers. I ask my colleagues
to stand with me in celebration of his commit-
ment to our community.
Made at Sacramento State and a U.S. Air
Force veteran, Mr. Aguero has dedicated his
life to service. Prior to his last twenty-five
years with California Volunteers, he worked at
the Sacramento Job Corps as Recreation Su-
pervisor and Counselor to the young people
attending for academic and technical training.
He later served as the CalSERVE Program
Manager for the California Conservation
Corps. In this capacity, he implemented and
managed grants. He also served in other ca-
pacities where he oversaw projects from start
to finish for 150 corps members.
In 1994, Mr. Aguero began his career at
California Volunteers, which was known as the
California Commission at the time. During his
time with the organization, he served as an
Assistant Director of Programs, Training and
Technical Assistance Director, Disability Coor-
dinator, and Manager of Program Operations.
Mr. Aguero has also been at the forefront of
disaster release efforts. In response to Hurri-
cane Katrina, he oversaw the deployment of
AmeriCorps members and most recently for
the Camp Fire in Paradise. Over the years, he
has partnered closely with AmeriCorps pro-
grams, providing them with essential training
and technical assistance, focused on devel-
oping the capacity of program associates to
oversee programs, and much more. Mr.
Aguero’s efforts have not gone unnoticed. The
legacy of his work garnered him the honor as
one of twenty AmeriCorps Trailblazers in
2014.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Eddie
Aguero for his successful career and his tire-
less advocacy for service programming and
engaging Californians in service. Mr. Aguero is
a true California treasure and a leader in our
community. I ask all my colleagues to join me
in wishing him congratulations for the past
three decades of service and best wishes for
his continued service.

IN HONOR OF THE EXTRAOR-
DINARY LIFE AND LEGACY OF
MRS. JUANITA ABERNATHY
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the remarkable life and
legacy of Mrs. Juanita Abernathy, a selfless
and determined leader in the struggle for civil
rights, whose direction and tireless engage-
ment were integral to the progress of the
movement. From the Montgomery bus boycott
to the marches from Selma to Montgomery
and on Washington, D.C., and beyond, Mrs.
Abernathy played a key role in our nation’s
proudest instances of citizen activism. She
fought boldly alongside her husband, the Rev-
erend Dr. Ralph Abernathy, and their dear
friends and fellow architects of the movement,
the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and
Mrs. Coretta Scott King, to enact necessary
and meaningful change, whose effects rever-
berated throughout our country. While many
male leaders of the civil rights movement have
rightfully become household names, the
women whose struggles and sacrifice were
equal and whose participation was necessary,
have not enjoyed the same recognition. Mrs.
Juanita Abernathy was a brilliant, courageous
leader in her own right, and today we recog-
nize her remarkable and distinct contributions.
Mrs. Abernathy was born on December 1,
1931 in Uniontown, Alabama, the youngest of
Alexander and Ella Gilmore Jones’ eight chil-
dren. Mr. and Mrs. Jones, who made their liv-
ing as dairy, beef and cotton farmers, did well
for themselves, and were named the most
successful farmers in the Black Belt by
Tuskegee Institute in the 1940s. At an early
age, Mrs. Abernathy was sent to live with her
older sister to attend an African American
boarding school, Selma University Prep
School, from kindergarten through graduation.
In the ninth grade, she met her future hus-
band, the Rev. Dr. Ralph Abernathy, who
wrote in his memoir that he was impressed by
her audacious spirit and inherent dignity. Both
were on display at the local grocery store
when a white clerk refused to carry Mrs.
Abernathy’s groceries to her car. She replied
that if he was unable to carry her groceries to
the car, he should instead go ahead and re-
turn the groceries to the shelves. In 1952,
after Mrs. Abernathy completed her B.S. in
business education at Tennessee State Uni-
versity in Nashville, she and Dr. Abernathy
were married.
Mrs. and Dr. Abernathy moved to Mont-
gomery, Alabama, where she became a sec-
retary for the Alabama chapter of the NAACP
and taught high school courses on business
education, while Dr. Abernathy served as pas-
tor of the First Baptist Church on Ripley St. In
1954, the couple hosted a new pastor, who
had been brought in to lead the Dexter Ave-
nue Baptist Church, Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., and his wife, Coretta Scott King. In 1955,
around the family dining room table, Mrs.
Abernathy wrote the business plan for the
Montgomery bus boycott, a plan which later
served as a blueprint for the Civil Rights
Movement. Meant to last only one day, the
boycott went on for 381 days, eventually lead-
ing to the courts desegregating public transit
and the country. In retaliation to the success
of the Montgomery bus boycott, the Abernathy
house was bombed while Dr. Abernathy was
in Atlanta with Dr. King, establishing the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
Thankfully, Mrs. Abernathy, who was home
with her oldest daughter Juandalynn, and
pregnant with her youngest, Donzaleigh, was
safe, though firefighters said that if the bomb
had landed only a foot away, it would have ex-
ploded the house’s main gas line. That same
night Dr. Abernathy’s church was bombed.
Over the years, Mrs. Abernathy endured ter-
ror, harassment and unbridled hatred from
white supremacists in her community and be-
yond; and yet, in the face of unimaginable
threats, Mrs. Abernathy maintained her innate
dignity and bravery.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1203
September 24, 2019
In 1961, Mrs. Abernathy and her husband
moved to Atlanta, Georgia where she worked
closely with the Kings to integrate Atlanta’s
public schools. Upon learning that Spring
Street Elementary School was the school fa-
vored by the children of Georgia Tech profes-
sors, Mrs. Abernathy sent her children
Donzaleigh, Juandalynn and their late brother
Ralph Abernathy III, who became some of the
first children to integrate, alongside two of the
Kings’ children. Mrs. Abernathy took great
pride in her children’s cultural and classical
education, bringing them to Europe and, in At-
lanta, to attend the opera. At this same time,
understanding the inextricable link between ra-
cial and economic inequality in this country,
Mrs. Abernathy fought to establish a National
Food Stamp Program for low-income families
and a National Free Meal Program for public
school children.
Mrs. Juanita Abernathy was perhaps the
last living member of Dr. King’s inner circle,
but her legacy supersedes even such promi-
nent relationships. In addition to her work dur-
ing the Civil Rights Movement, Mrs. Abernathy
has travelled around the world three times on
peace missions, served on the board of
MARTA for over a decade and became a na-
tional sales director for Mary Kay Cosmetics,
ranking second in the nation in recruitment. A
true servant leader, Mrs. Abernathy’s brilliant
mind, full heart and resilient spirit should serve
as a reminder to us all of what constitutes a
life well lived. When she sat at President
Barack Obama’s inauguration, it was in a
place of honor, directly behind former Presi-
dent Bill Clinton.
On a personal note, I was honored to get to
know Mrs. Abernathy during her many pilgrim-
ages to my hometown of Selma, Alabama for
the annual commemorations of ‘‘Bloody Sun-
day’’ and the March from Selma to Mont-
gomery. She was a powerful force for change
and a proud product of Alabama’s Black Belt,
who passionately protected the legacy of her
husband and their lifelong work to advance
civil rights in this nation. Mrs. Abernathy gra-
ciously encouraged me to run for Congress
and honored me with her presence in Selma
on election night when I won in November
2010. I saw in her face that night the pride
she felt witnessing the election of Alabama’s
first black Congresswoman. It was a time that
had come because of her personal courage
and sacrifices to pave the way for future gen-
erations of black children like me to succeed.
I know there comes great responsibility in
standing on her broad shoulders and I seek to
honor that privilege every day in my efforts to
protect and further the progress made and
legacy of the Freedom Fighters for Justice like
Mrs. Juanita Abernathy. To her family, I thank
them for sharing their parents with the world.
Their mother’s passion, courage and deter-
mination will always live on in the hearts and
actions of those she touched.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in paying tribute and honor to Alabama na-
tive Mrs. Juanita Jones Abernathy on the
passing of this Civil Rights icon and true
American heroine whose tremendous efforts
helped this nation on its path towards a more
perfect union.
HONORING THE 10TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF JOINT BASE MCGUIRE-
DIX-LAKEHURST
HON. ANDY KIM
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the 10th anniversary of Joint Base
McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. The Joint Base, and
the tens of thousands based there who serve
our country, is a critical part of the fabric of
our community, economy, and national secu-
rity.
Bases McGuire, Dix and Lakehurst have
stood as a unified base for a decade, but each
has a rich history. Fort Dix was established
during World War I, and trained soldiers that
helped liberate Europe During World War II.
McGuire Air Force Base was a hub for oper-
ations during the Cold War, and Lakehurst
Naval Air Station was home to some of the
Navy’s most historic missions.
Today, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst
continues in that proud tradition of serving at
the vanguard of our nation’s defense. The
servicemen and women training and operating
at the Joint Base continue to be deployed
overseas to project American security and pro-
tect America’s interests.
Furthermore, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-
Lakehurst is an absolutely critical part of New
Jersey’s economy. The Joint Base is one of
our state’s largest employers and generates
billions in income to support our communities.
It is also a point of incredible pride for the
people of Burlington and Ocean Counties.
I appreciate the work that those stationed at
Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst do on a
daily basis to keep our nation safe and sup-
port families living in New Jersey. On behalf of
my neighbors in Burlington and Ocean Coun-
ties, I congratulate our base leadership and
servicemembers for a successful ten years
serving our community and country, and look
forward to continuing that work in the years
and decades to come.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF HARRINGTON LIBRARY
HON. VAN TAYLOR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise
to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Harrington
Public Library in Plano, Texas. The first library
to ever call Plano Home, Harrington opened
its doors in 1969.
With a collection of over 15,000 volumes,
Harrington offers our community a multitude of
classes ranging from languages, Test prep,
money management, and much more.
I would like to thank the library, their staff,
and volunteers for all of their hard work in cul-
tivating a strong appreciation for literacy,
learning, and imagination.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating the Harrington Public Library on 50
years of serving the city of Plano.
TRIBUTE HONORING SHAWN B.
HARLEY
HON. HAROLD ROGERS
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to pay tribute to Shawn B. Harley
upon his retirement as Meteorologist-In-
Charge after dedicating 31 years to the Na-
tional Weather Service, including more than
two decades in Jackson, Kentucky.
Meteorologists provide the first line of de-
fense for residents to prepare and seek safe
shelter during severe weather events. When a
violent and historic storm produced a deadly
tornado outbreak in Eastern Kentucky on
March 2, 2012, the Jackson Weather Service
provided the most accurate and vital storm
tracking information and urgent local warnings
that undoubtedly saved countless lives. That
fateful day was just one of many that required
fast, accurate and minute-by-minute tracking
of the meteorological team in Jackson, led by
Shawn Harley. I want to commend Shawn for
dedicating his time and talents to help protect
the people of Southern and Eastern Kentucky
for 23 years.
In addition to his career in meteorology,
Shawn has extended his heart of service by
volunteering with the Red Cross and becom-
ing a board member. He also works with the
youth group at the First United Church of
Jackson and dedicates time to help the Holy
Cross Catholic Church. Shawn and his wife,
Susan, have also cooked and served hearty
meals for the Haven House, a homeless shel-
ter in Breathitt County, and assisted with
projects for local senior citizens. It is clear that
Shawn’s courage of conviction has impacted
families and individuals who are most-in-need,
and I applaud his spirit of philanthropy and
goodwill for the people of our region.
Finally, I want to congratulate Shawn on his
retirement from the National Weather Service,
including assignments that have spanned
across Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana. My wife,
Cynthia, and I wish Shawn and his family a re-
tirement filled with many years of joy and hap-
piness.

RECOGNITION OF KAZIMIR
PULASKI
HON. DUNCAN HUNTER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and honor a Polish and American
hero: Kazimir Pulaski. Kazimir Pulaski was
born in Warsaw, Poland on March 6, 1745, to
Polish nobility. At only 15 years old, he joined
the Polish resistance fighting against the Rus-
sian and Prussian forces that were threatening
Poland’s freedom. Forced into exile by the
Russians, he left Poland for France and met
Benjamin Franklin who was on a diplomatic
mission in Paris securing support for the colo-
nies in their revolutionary war against the Brit-
ish. Benjamin Franklin’s description of how the
colonies were rising up, fighting to be a new
and independent nation, inspired Pulaski, and
he volunteered to go fight alongside the colo-
nists. When in America, Pulaski distinguished
himself as a courageous fighter and military
tactician. Congress appointed him Brigadier-
General in charge of mounted brigades, and
that lead to Congress, in 1778, establishing
the Cavalry and appointing General Pulaski as
its leader. General Pulaski was known as a
strong taskmaster, asking much of his men,
and yet was also known to use his own per-
sonal money to ensure they had the finest
equipment when Congress was slow in pro-
viding funds. On October 9, 1779, General Pu-
laski was mortally wounded while riding into
the Battle of Savannah, hit by cannon fire.
Please join me in honoring General Pulaski,
who came to the United States with one pur-
pose, to fight for our cause of independence,
and who died on foreign soil, defending not
just our liberty and justice, but also the greater
principle of freedom.

NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to voice my support for National
Recovery Month.
Every September, we recognize the impor-
tance of increasing awareness and under-
standing of mental and substance use dis-
orders as well as to honoring the individuals,
over 23 million in the United States, who are
in recovery.
My experience as the first registered nurse
elected to Congress and a former chief psy-
chiatric nurse allows me to examine our na-
tion’s healthcare priorities with experience and
foresight. We must ensure that our families,
communities, and health care systems have
the necessary resources and support to effec-
tively address mental health and substance
use in our country.
There is much to be done to improve our
country’s access to treatment services for
mental and substance use disorders, and I am
determined to continue my work with my col-
leagues in Congress.
I urge my colleagues to support National
Recovery Month.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SAINT
LAWRENCE SEAWAY RENAMING
BILL
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, today, our
nation celebrates the 60th Anniversary of the
opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Devel-
opment Corporation. On this anniversary, I am
introducing legislation to add ‘‘Great Lakes’’ to
the name of the Seaway.
This new name, the ‘‘Great Lakes’’ Saint
Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation
will now reflect the Seaway’s enormous role
for connecting commerce, promoting economic
development, and protecting national security
across the nation.
In 1959, Great Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II
and U.S. President Eisenhower presided over
festivities that marked the opening of the mod-
ern Great Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway.
Sixty years later, the role of the seaway is
just as crucial. A 2018 analysis by the Saint
Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation
found that commercial navigation that transits
the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario sus-
tains 92,661 jobs in the US, Canada, and sup-
ports almost $13 billion in economic activity.
It is imperative that the United States con-
tinues to support the mission of the Seaway
and ensure that it receives the recognition it
deserves.

PUERTO RICO’S MEDICAID
PROGRAM
HON. JENNIFFER GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN
OF PUERTO RICO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto Rico.
Madam Speaker, on September 19 the House
passed a Continuing Resolution to give us ad-
ditional time to agree on a funding package for
Fiscal Year 2020 without the disruption
caused by a government shutdown.
I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle for including a provision to extend
the application of the 100 percent FMAP to
Puerto Rico’s Medicaid Program for the next 7
weeks. We know that action was taken in rec-
ognition of the unfairness in which the Ameri-
cans who live in the territories are treated by
under our Medicaid program.
Federal spending for Puerto Rico’s Medicaid
program will likely reach the $374 million-dol-
lar cap before the expiration of the Continuing
Resolution. Because of this, we must act
quickly to approve H.R. 2328, which aligns the
statutory spending cap with the actual pro-
gram expenditures, in order to provide a more
long-term solution for such an important fed-
eral program for our fellow Americans who de-
pend on it.
