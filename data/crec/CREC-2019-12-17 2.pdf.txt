DIVISION A—DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2020
The following is an explanation of the ef-
fects of this Act, which makes appropria-
tions for the Department of Defense for fis-
cal year 2020. Unless otherwise noted, ref-
erences to the House and Senate reports are
to House Report 116–84 and Senate Report
116–103, respectively. The language contained
in the House and Senate reports warrant full
compliance and carry the same weight as
language included in this explanatory state-
ment unless specifically addressed to the
contrary in the bill or this explanatory
statement. While repeating some language
from the House or Senate reports for empha-
sis, this explanatory statement does not in-
tend to negate the language referred to
above unless expressly provided herein.
DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND
ACTIVITY
For the purposes of the Balanced Budget
and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985
(Public Law 99–177), as amended by the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–
119), and by the Budget Enforcement Act of
1990 (Public Law 101–508), the terms ‘‘pro-
gram, project, and activity’’ for appropria-
tions contained in this Act shall be defined
as the most specific level of budget items
identified in the Department of Defense Ap-
propriations Act, 2020, the related classified
annexes and explanatory statements, and the
P–1 and R–1 budget justification documents
as subsequently modified by congressional
action.
The following exception to the above defi-
nition shall apply: the military personnel
and the operation and maintenance ac-
counts, for which the term ‘‘program,
project, and activity’’ is defined as the ap-
propriations accounts contained in the De-
partment of Defense Appropriations Act.
At the time the President submits the
budget request for fiscal year 2021, the Sec-
retary of Defense is directed to transmit to
the congressional defense committees budget
justification documents to be known as the
‘‘M–1’’ and the ‘‘O–1’’ which shall identify, at
the budget activity, activity group, and sub-
activity group level, the amounts requested
by the President to be appropriated to the
Department of Defense for military per-
sonnel and operation and maintenance in
any budget request, or amended budget re-
quest, for fiscal year 2021.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR BASE AND
OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS FUNDING
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
continue to follow the reprogramming guid-
ance for acquisition accounts as specified in
the report accompanying the House version
of the Department of Defense Appropriations
bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–
279). The dollar threshold for reprogramming
funds shall be $10,000,000 for military per-
sonnel; operation and maintenance; procure-
ment; and research, development, test and
evaluation.
Also, the Under Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller) is directed to continue to pro-
vide the congressional defense committees
annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and
II and quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form
1416 reports for Service and defense-wide ac-
counts in titles III and IV of this Act. Re-
ports for titles III and IV shall comply with
guidance specified in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying the Department of De-
fense Appropriations Act, 2006. The Depart-
ment shall continue to follow the limitation
that prior approval reprogrammings are set
at either the specified dollar threshold or 20
percent of the procurement or research, de-
velopment, test and evaluation line, which-
ever is less. These thresholds are cumulative
from the base for reprogramming value as
modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if
the combined value of transfers into or out
of a military personnel (M–1); an operation
and maintenance (O–1); a procurement (P–1);
or a research, development, test and evalua-
tion (R–1) line exceeds the identified thresh-
old, the Secretary of Defense must submit a
prior approval reprogramming to the con-
gressional defense committees. In addition,
guidelines on the application of prior ap-
proval reprogramming procedures for con-
gressional special interest items are estab-
lished elsewhere in this statement.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in the ta-
bles for each appropriation account shall be
provided only for the specific purposes indi-
cated in the tables.
CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been
provided or items for which funding is spe-
cifically reduced as shown in the project
level tables or in paragraphs using the
phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ are congres-
sional special interest items for the purpose
of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form
1414). Each of these items must be carried on
the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount, as
specifically addressed in the explanatory
statement.

CLASSIFIED ANNEX
Adjustments to classified programs are ad-
dressed in the accompanying classified
annex.
JOINT ENTERPRISE DEFENSE INFRASTRUCTURE
The agreement notes that the Chief Infor-
mation Officer of the Department of Defense
has provided the report required in House
Report 116–84 regarding the Department’s
plans to transition to a multi-cloud environ-
ment and satisfied the conditions that pro-
hibited the obligation and expenditure of
funds to migrate data and applications to
the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure
cloud.
The agreement retains a requirement in
House Report 116–84 requiring the Chief In-
formation Officer of the Department of De-
fense to submit quarterly reports on the im-
plementation of its cloud strategy.
MILCLOUD 2.0
It is understood that the Department of
Defense is currently operating milCloud 2.0,
a commercially-owned and operated cloud
that is housed in two Defense Information
Systems Agency data centers, that offers
cloud-based infrastructure, platform, and
software as-a-service solutions. In May 2018,
the Chief Information Officer of the Depart-
ment of Defense distributed a memorandum
directing all Fourth Estate agencies to mi-
grate to milCloud 2.0. Per this direction, the
Department of Defense is encouraged to
complete migration to milCloud 2.0 by the
end of fiscal year 2020.
SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND OBLIGATION
AND EXPENDITURE PLANS
The existing budget justification and quar-
terly execution data lack certain details to
analyze trends and program office perform-
ance. To facilitate appropriate oversight, the
Commander of the United States Special Op-
erations Command is directed to provide the
House and Senate Appropriations Commit-
tees detailed spend plans at the project level
for the procurement and research and devel-
opment appropriations accounts. The spend
plans shall include all active fiscal years,
with monthly obligation and target bench-
marks. The first spend plan should be pro-
vided not later than 45 days after the enact-
ment of this Act, and subsequent spend plans
should be provided annually with the sub-
mission of the budget request.
CIVILIAN PAY RAISE
The agreement recognizes the value of the
Department of Defense civilian workforce
and acknowledges the 3.1 percent federal pay
raise for all federal civilian employees.
F–15EX
The agreement includes $1,052,900,000 for
eight F–15EX fighters and transfers
$364,400,000 from Aircraft Procurement, Air
Force to Research, Development, Test and
Evaluation, Air Force for the procurement of
two test aircraft and half of the requested
amount for non-recurring engineering. Of the
funds provided in Aircraft Procurement, Air
Force for the remaining six F–15EX aircraft,
no more than $64,800,000 for long-lead mate-
rials may be obligated until the Secretary of
the Air Force submits a report to the con-
gressional defense committees with the fol-
lowing documentation, or the milestone C-
equivalents under Section 804 middle tier ac-
quisition authority, to include an approved
program acquisition strategy; a capability
production document; a life-cycle cost esti-
mate; a life-cycle sustainment plan; a test
and evaluation master plan; and a post-pro-
duction fielding strategy. Additionally, the
Secretary of the Air Force is directed to in-
clude F–15EX program updates and progress
towards critical milestones in the Section
804 triannual reports to Congress. Finally,
the Secretary of the Air Force is directed to
submit to the congressional defense commit-
tees not later than 60 days after the enact-
ment of this Act a report with a comprehen-
sive review of options to address the Air
Force fighter capacity shortfall. This lan-
guage replaces the language under the head-
ing ‘‘F–15EX’’ in Senate Report 116–103.
TITLE I—MILITARY PERSONNEL
The agreement provides $150,262,882,000 in

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SPECIAL
INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been
provided or have been specifically reduced as
shown in the project level tables or in para-
graphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only
to’’ in the explanatory statement are con-
gressional special interest items for the pur-
pose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD
Form 1414). Each of these items must be car-
ried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated
amount as specifically addressed in the ex-
planatory statement. Below Threshold
Reprogrammings may not be used to either
restore or reduce funding from congressional
special interest items as identified on the DD
Form 1414.
90/10 RULE
The agreement adopts the reporting re-
quirements contained under the heading ‘‘90/
10 Rule’’ in House Report 116–84 but changes
the submission date to not later than 180
days after the enactment of this Act. Fur-
ther, the Secretary of Defense is directed to
work collaboratively with the Secretaries of
Education and Veterans Affairs on an au-
thoritative data set that includes the total
funding level to each for-profit institution
for the most recent academic year from all
sources provided by the Departments of Edu-
cation, Veterans Affairs, and Defense to
more accurately derive estimates for the re-
porting requirement to the congressional
committees.
DEFENSE PERSONAL PROPERTY PROGRAM
The agreement supports the desire and
commitment of the United States Transpor-
tation Command (USTRANSCOM) to im-
prove the current system for the movement
of personal effects within the Department of
Defense. However, concerns over
USTRANSCOM’s plan to award a single
source contract remain. Therefore, in addi-
tion to any other requirements, this agree-
ment directs that no such single source
award may be signed before April 1, 2020; and
before the Commander of USTRANSCOM has
provided the congressional defense commit-
tees with a description of anticipated cost
savings broken out by Service across the Fu-
ture Years Defense Program.
WIND ENERGY
The agreement does not adopt the lan-
guage under the heading ‘‘Wind Energy’’ in
House Report 116–84.

PRIVATE CONTRACTED SHIP MAINTENANCE
The agreement includes a pilot program to
fund the private contract ship maintenance
planned for the Pacific Fleet in fiscal year
2020 in Other Procurement, Navy, as pro-
posed in Senate Report 116–103. The funding
in Other Procurement, Navy line 23x Ship
Maintenance, Repair and Modernization
shall only be for such activities executed in
the United States and is hereby designated a
congressional special interest item. The Sec-
retary of the Navy shall provide the congres-
sional defense committees the following in
relation to the pilot—
1. An execution plan for the funding in
Other Procurement, Navy line 23x, Ship
Maintenance, Repair and Modernization.
This shall be submitted to the congressional
defense committees prior to the execution of
funding and shall include the following data
points for each ship included in the pilot pro-
gram:
a. Ship class, hull number and name of
each ship;
b. Type of availability;
c. Location of the work;
d. Execution plan start date;
e. Execution plan end date; and
f. Execution plan funded amount (in thou-
sands).
2. Not later than 15 days after the end of
each fiscal quarter, an updated plan to the
first report showing:
a. Ship class, hull number and name of
each ship;
b. Type of availability;
c. Location of the work;
d. Actual or current estimate of start date;
e. Actual or current estimate of end date;
f. Actual funded amount and estimate to
complete (in thousands); and
the quarterly update shall also include an
execution review of the funding in line 1B4B
Ship Depot Maintenance in Operation and
Maintenance, Navy.
ANALYSIS OF AIRCRAFT CARRIER, SURFACE
SHIP, AND SUBMARINE MAINTENANCE DELAYS
Completing maintenance on time is inte-
gral to supporting fleet readiness, meeting
strategic and operational requirements, and
ensuring the Navy’s ships reach their ex-
pected service lives. From numerous reports,
the Navy continues to face persistent main-
tenance delays that affect the majority of its
maintenance efforts and threaten its at-
tempt to restore readiness. Since fiscal year
2014, Navy ships have spent over 27,000 more
days in maintenance than expected, with 70
percent of maintenance periods on average
experiencing delays. There is some prelimi-
nary evidence that the Navy has begun pilot
efforts to analyze maintenance challenges
for some elements of the fleet. However,
these efforts are not comprehensively exam-
ining the root causes of delays across the en-
tire fleet. Further, absent such an analysis,
the Navy is not well positioned to develop a
plan to address its persistent maintenance
delays.
To address these issues, the Secretary of
the Navy is directed to assign responsibility
to conduct a comprehensive and systematic
analysis to identify the underlying causes of
aircraft carrier, surface ship, and submarine
maintenance delays and submit a report on
its findings not later than 180 days after the
enactment of this Act to the congressional
defense committees and to the Government
Accountability Office. This report shall in-
corporate results-oriented elements, includ-
ing analytically-based goals; metrics to
measure progress; and the identification of
required resources, risks, and stakeholders
to achieve those goals. The Secretary of the
Navy shall update the congressional defense
committees annually thereafter on its
progress to achieve the goals set forth in the
plan. Further, the Comptroller General of
the United States is directed to submit a re-
view of the report to the congressional de-
fense committees not later than 90 days after
receiving the report from the Navy.
JET NOISE
Communities situated around military in-
stallations with airfields have expressed con-
cerns of the negative effects that jet noise
may have on them. It is acknowledged that
modeling aircraft noise, as opposed to meas-
uring it, provides the most accurate assess-
ment of impacts on a community. Therefore,
the Secretary of the Navy is directed to
model the level of jet noise generated by
Navy aviation assets and to make that data
available to the public.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,
MARINE CORPS
The agreement provides $7,868,468,000 for
Operation and Maintenance, Marine Corps,

DEFENSE LANGUAGE AND NATIONAL SECURITY
EDUCATION OFFICE
The Defense Language and National Secu-
rity Education Office provides critical col-
lege accredited training for service members
and government officials in a number of lan-
guages and strategic cultures in partnership
with universities across the country. A re-
port provided by the Department of Defense
in response to language included in the re-
port accompanying the Department of De-
fense Appropriations Act, 2019 (Public Law
115–245) regarding the Department’s ability
to fill positions requiring high level stra-
tegic language capability reflects the clear
and demonstrable need for increased re-
sources. The Secretary of Defense is encour-
aged to place a higher priority on the Lan-
guage Training Centers and the Language
Flagship strategic language training pro-
gram. The agreement designates the funding
included in the fiscal year 2020 budget re-
quest for the Language Training Centers as a
congressional special interest item.
It is further noted that funding for the
Language Flagship program has not been in-
creased since its inception in 2003 and the
Secretary of Defense is urged to provide ad-
ditional resources to the Language Flagship
program that ensure both military and civil-
ian personnel receive the language and cul-
ture training needed to effectively complete
missions. Additionally, the Secretary of De-
fense is directed to identify additional re-
sources that may be required to address ex-
isting shortfalls in this skillset.
SECURITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
Prior to the initial obligation of funds
made available in Title II and Title IX of
this Act for the Defense Security Coopera-
tion Agency (DSCA), the Director of DSCA is
directed to submit a spend plan by budget
activity and sub-activity to the House and
Senate Appropriations Committees. For
funds planned for the Security Cooperation
Account, the Director shall, in coordination
with the geographic combatant commanders,
include amounts planned for each combatant
command and country, and a comparison to
such amounts provided in the previous three
fiscal years. Amounts in the plan shall only
reflect those amounts designated in the fis-
cal year 2020 budget justification materials
and modified by fiscal year 2020 appropria-
tions adjustments in this Act and in the
table under this heading for DSCA. The plan
shall be updated and submitted to the House
and Senate Appropriations Committees upon
notification of funds under this heading to
include a justification for changes made. A
similar plan shall be provided to such Com-
mittees outlining funds requested for fiscal
year 2021 with the submission of the fiscal
year 2021 budget request.
INDO-PACIFIC STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AND PLAN
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
submit a copy of the Indo-Pacific Strategic
Framework and the Indo-Pacific Implemen-
tation Plan to the congressional defense
committees not later than 30 days after the
enactment of this Act.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION
ACCOUNTS
(INCLUDING BASE AND OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY
OPERATIONS FUNDING)
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
continue to follow the reprogramming guid-
ance as specified in the report accompanying
the House version of the Department of De-
fense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008
(House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dol-
lar threshold for reprogramming funds shall
be $10,000,000 for procurement and research,
development, test and evaluation.
Also, the Under Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller) is directed to continue to pro-
vide the congressional defense committees
quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416
reports for Service and defense-wide ac-
counts in titles III and IV of this Act. Re-
ports for titles III and IV shall comply with
the guidance specified in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of
Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The De-
partment shall continue to follow the limita-
tion that prior approval reprogrammings are
set at either the specified dollar threshold or
20 percent of the procurement or research,
development, test and evaluation line,
whichever is less. These thresholds are cu-
mulative from the base for reprogramming
value as modified by any adjustments.
Therefore, if the combined value of transfers
into or out of a procurement (P–1) or re-
search, development, test and evaluation (R–
1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the
Secretary of Defense must submit a prior ap-
proval reprogramming to the congressional
defense committees. In addition, guidelines
on the application of prior approval re-
programming procedures for congressional
special interest items are established else-
where in this statement.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in these ta-
bles shall be provided only for the specific
purposes indicated in the tables.
PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been
recommended or items for which funding is
specifically reduced as shown in the project
level tables detailing recommended adjust-
ments or in paragraphs using the phrase
‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory
statement are congressional special interest
items for the purpose of the Base for Re-
programming (DD Form 1414). Each of these
items must be carried on the DD Form 1414
at the stated amount, as specifically ad-
dressed elsewhere in the explanatory state-
ment.
JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PRIOR YEAR SAVINGS
The recent Lot 12–14 contract agreement
for procurement of the F–35 Joint Strike
Fighter resulted in substantial savings from
prior year appropriations due to declining
unit costs. The agreement preserves
$250,400,000 of this savings within the Air-
craft Procurement, Navy and Aircraft Pro-
curement, Air Force accounts for fiscal years
2018 and 2019 in order to fund the alternate
sourcing of F–35 parts manufactured in the
Republic of Turkey. In addition, the agree-
ment preserves $322,563,000 in the same ac-
counts for reinvestments identified by the
Director of the F–35 Joint Program Office to
support future cost reductions and more effi-
cient sustainment and to convert F–35As,
previously designated for Turkey, for United
States Air Force use.
JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER SPARES DATA
The agreement provides $757,471,000 in ad-
ditional spares for all three variants of the
Joint Strike Fighter. The Secretary of De-
fense is directed to not obligate or expend
more than 50 percent of these funds until 15
days after the Director of the F–35 Joint Pro-
gram Office submits to the congressional de-
fense committees a certification that the De-
partment of Defense has submitted a formal
request for proposal (RFP) for provisioning
and cataloguing data to the F–35 prime con-
tractor, and that the RFP has been coordi-
nated with the prime contractor for delivery
of a proposal by the end of calendar year
2020. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense
is further directed to include the costs of ac-
quiring these data, as applicable, in future
budget exhibits and briefing materials for
the congressional defense committees begin-
ning with the fiscal year 2021 budget submis-
sion. This language replaces the language
under the heading ‘‘Positioning the F–35 Pro-
gram for Continued Success’’ in House Re-
port 116–84.
AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT, ARMY
The agreement provides $3,771,329,000 for
Aircraft Procurement, Army, as follows:

FFG(X) FRIGATE PROGRAM
There remain concerns with the depend-
ence of the Department of the Navy to
source surface ship components from foreign
industry partners rather than promote a ro-
bust domestic industrial base. The agree-
ment amends a legislative provision included
in H.R. 2740 to allow the Secretary of the
Navy to procure certain components for the
FFG(X) Frigate program from non-United
States suppliers with the direction that
United States manufactured propulsion en-
gines and propulsion reduction gears must be
incorporated into the program not later than
with the eleventh ship of the Frigate class.
Furthermore, the Secretary of the Navy is
directed to conduct a study on the impacts
of incorporating United States manufactured
propulsion engines and propulsion reduction
gears into the FFG(X) Frigate program prior
to the eleventh ship, and to submit the study
to the congressional defense committees not
later than 180 days after the contract award
of the FFG(X) Frigate. The study shall in-
clude estimates of potential changes to the
acquisition schedule and any associated
costs with incorporating domestically pro-
duced propulsion equipment into the FFG(X)
Frigate program with the fourth, sixth,
eighth, tenth, and eleventh ship of the pro-
gram.
Additionally, the Secretary of the Navy is
encouraged to support a robust domestic in-
dustrial base with more stringent contract
requirements in future surface ship classes.
OTHER PROCUREMENT, NAVY
The agreement provides $10,075,257,000 for
Other Procurement, Navy, as follows:

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION
ACCOUNTS
(INCLUDING BASE AND OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY
OPERATIONS FUNDING)
The Secretary of Defense is directed to
continue to follow the reprogramming guid-
ance as specified in the report accompanying
the House version of the Department of De-
fense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008
(House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dol-
lar threshold for reprogramming funds shall
be $10,000,000 for procurement and research,
development, test and evaluation.
Also, the Under Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller) is directed to continue to pro-
vide the congressional defense committees
quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416
reports for Service and defense-wide ac-
counts in titles III and IV of this Act. Re-
ports for titles III and IV shall comply with
the guidance specified in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Department of
Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The De-
partment shall continue to follow the limita-
tion that prior approval reprogrammings are
set at either the specified dollar threshold or
20 percent of the procurement or research,
development, test and evaluation line,
whichever is less. These thresholds are cu-
mulative from the base for reprogramming
value as modified by any adjustments.
Therefore, if the combined value of transfers
into or out of a procurement (P–1) or re-
search, development, test and evaluation (R–
1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the
Secretary of Defense must submit a prior ap-
proval reprogramming to the congressional
defense committees. In addition, guidelines
on the application of prior approval re-
programming procedures for congressional
special interest items are established else-
where in this statement.
FUNDING INCREASES
The funding increases outlined in these ta-
bles shall be provided only for the specific
purposes indicated in the tables.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND
EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS
Items for which additional funds have been
recommended or items for which funding is
specifically reduced as shown in the project
level tables detailing recommended adjust-
ments or in paragraphs using the phrase
‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory
statement are congressional special interest
items for the purpose of the Base for Re-
programming (DD Form 1414). Each of these
items must be carried on the DD Form 1414
at the stated amount, as specifically ad-
dressed elsewhere in the explanatory state-
ment.
JOINT HYPERSONICS TRANSITION OFFICE
Hypersonic weapons pose a dangerous new
class of threat to national security. They op-
erate at exceptionally high speeds and can
maneuver unpredictably, making them chal-
lenging to track and difficult to intercept.
Potential adversaries, such as Russia and
China, have recognized the value of
hypersonic weapons to offset United States
military capabilities and hold United States
forces at risk. Adversaries have made alarm-
ing progress in developing and dem-
onstrating such weapons, far outstripping
the pace of United States advancements. The
agreement supports efforts aimed at devel-
oping capabilities to hold adversaries at
risk, as well as capabilities to defend against
growing hypersonic threats.
The agreement strongly supports increased
emphasis on research, development, testing,
and demonstration of hypersonics tech-
nologies and systems. However, there are
concerns that the rapid growth in hypersonic
research has the potential to result in stove-
piped, proprietary systems that duplicate ca-
pabilities and increase costs.
The agreement includes $100,000,000 for the
Joint Hypersonics Transition Office to de-
velop and implement an integrated science
and technology roadmap for hypersonics and
to establish a university consortium for
hypersonics research and workforce develop-
ment to support Department efforts to expe-
dite testing, evaluation, and acquisition of
hypersonic weapons systems, and to coordi-
nate current and future research, develop-
ment, test, and evaluation programs across
the Department of Defense.
The Under Secretary of Defense (Research
and Engineering) is directed to submit a re-
port to the congressional defense commit-
tees not later than 90 days after the enact-
ment of this Act, and quarterly updates
thereafter, on its integrated science and
technology roadmap describing the short-
term, mid-term, and long-term goals of the
Department; progress toward achieving the
goals; associated investment needed to
achieve the goals; and plans for a university
consortium.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPONENTS SUPPLY
CHAIN
The Under Secretary for Defense (Acquisi-
tion and Sustainment) is directed to provide
a report to the congressional defense com-
mittees not later than 180 days after the en-
actment of this Act which evaluates the risk
to the supply chain for fiber and related opti-
cal telecommunications components, and if
appropriate, recommends risk mitigation
strategies for Department of Defense acqui-
sition programs.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND
EVALUATION, ARMY
The agreement provides $12,543,435,000 for
Research, Development, Test and Evalua-
tion, Army, as follows:

OPTIONALLY MANNED FIGHTING VEHICLE
The agreement provides $205,620,000 for the
Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle
(OMFV), a reduction of $172,780,000 from the
budget request. It is directed that none of
the funds provided may be obligated for mid-
dle tier acquisition rapid prototyping until
the Secretary of the Army has provided a
brief to the congressional defense commit-
tees which includes the results of the source
selection process; an explanation of how pro-
gram requirements were built, their
traceability to the national defense strategy
and multi-domain operations, and the capa-
bility gaps they address; and an updated ac-
quisition strategy and program schedule.
Given the significance of the OMFV program
in support of Army modernization, it is im-
perative that the congressional defense com-
mittees receive timely schedule and cost in-
formation in order to make informed deci-
sions.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND
EVALUATION, NAVY
The agreement provides $20,155,115,000 for
Research, Development, Test and Evalua-
tion, Navy, as follows:

LARGE UNMANNED SURFACE VESSELS
The agreement recommends $209,200,000 to
fully fund two Large Unmanned Surface Ves-
sels (LUSVs), as requested in the fiscal year
2020 budget. The Secretary of the Navy is di-
rected to comply with the full funding policy
for LUSVs in future budget submissions.
Further, the agreement recommends
$50,000,000 for the design of future LUSVs
without a vertical launch system capability
in fiscal year 2020. Incremental upgrade ca-
pability for a vertical launch system may be
addressed in future fiscal years. It is directed
that no funds may be awarded for the con-
ceptual design of future LUSVs until the As-
sistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, De-
velopment and Acquisition) briefs the con-
gressional defense committees on the up-
dated acquisition strategy for unmanned sur-
face vessels.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND
EVALUATION, AIR FORCE

COMBAT RESCUE HELICOPTER
The agreement provides $247,047,000, the
same as the budget request, for the contin-
ued development of the Combat Rescue Heli-
copter. It is noted that the Air Force will use
some of the funds provided to procure an ad-
ditional test asset to support a moderniza-
tion program that includes upgrades to ad-
dress an evolving threat environment. The
Secretary of the Air Force is directed to
modify future budget exhibits and briefings
to the congressional defense committees to
clearly separate and identify funding for the
modernization program and provide greater
detail on both modernization requirements
and the planned use of funds.
NEXT GENERATION OVERHEAD PERSISTENT
INFRARED
The agreement retains language included
in Senate Report 116–103 which designates
the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent In-
frared program as a congressional special in-
terest item. The Secretary of the Air Force
is directed to provide quarterly reports to
the congressional defense committees on the
program.
OVERHEAD PERSISTENT INFRARED ENTERPRISE
ARCHITECTURE
The Department of Defense lacks con-
sensus on its space architecture plans to
meet requirements for strategic and tactical
missile warning, missile defense, and
battlespace awareness mission areas. Cur-
rently, the Air Force, Missile Defense Agen-
cy, Space Development Agency, and others,
are planning to spend tens of billions of dol-
lars pursuing various potential satellite con-
stellations, with a variety of sensor types,
constellation sizes, and orbits ranging from
proliferated low-earth to geosynchronous
and others. The Department has yet to syn-
chronize or harmonize these proposals into a
clearly articulated executable and affordable
integrated enterprise space architecture.
While the Air Force’s Next-Generation
Overhead Persistent Infrared Block 0 is an
important near-term step for the missile
warning mission area, an enterprise archi-
tecture strategy is needed to inform deci-
sions on plans, programs, and investments to
address the spectrum of overhead persistent
infrared mission areas. Without such an en-
terprise architecture strategy there is poten-
tial for inefficiencies, duplication, and un-
necessary overlap. The lack of an integrated
strategy also risks missing opportunities to
integrate sensors and capabilities to increase
performance and improve survivability
against increasing threats.
Therefore, the Secretary of Defense is di-
rected to develop an integrated overhead
persistent infrared enterprise architecture
strategy to carry out these mission areas.
The strategy shall define the Department’s
proposed reference architecture, acquisition
strategy, identification of lead agency or
Service for each element, estimated cost,
schedule of key milestones, and transition
plans. The Secretary of Defense is directed
to provide the strategy to the congressional
defense committees not later than 270 days
after the enactment of this Act.
WEATHER ENTERPRISE STRATEGY
The agreement notes concerns about the
Air Force’s weather acquisition strategy and
commitment to provide accurate and timely
weather data, a mission with a profound im-
pact on daily worldwide military operations.
Therefore, the Secretary of the Air Force is
directed to provide the congressional defense
committees, not later than 180 days after the
enactment of this Act, with a strategy, in-
cluding proposed acquisition plans, esti-
mated cost, and schedule of key milestones,
for a weather enterprise architecture to
meet all twelve validated space-based envi-
ronmental monitoring requirements and re-
lated Joint Requirements Oversight Council
requirements though at least 2030.
LOW COST ATTRITABLE AIRCRAFT TECHNOLOGY
The agreement provides an additional
$100,000,000 to further develop Low Cost
Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT).
The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to
submit to the congressional defense commit-
tees a spend plan for this additional funding,
plus any LCAAT funding in the underlying
fiscal year 2020 budget request, not later
than 90 days after the enactment of this Act.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND
EVALUATION, DEFENSE-WIDE
The agreement provides $25,938,027,000 for
Research, Development, Test and Evalua-
tion, Defense-Wide, as follows:

REDESIGNED KILL VEHICLE PROGRAM TERMI-
NATION AND UNITED STATES HOMELAND DE-
FENSE
Subsequent to the submission of the fiscal
year 2020 budget request, the Under Sec-
retary of Defense (Research and Engineering)
terminated for convenience the Redesigned
Kill Vehicle (RKV) program. It is noted that
the Administration is evaluating several po-
tential interceptor options for improving the
Nation’s homeland defense, to include a Next
Generation Interceptor (NGI) that would
field several years from now. Therefore, the
agreement recommends several adjustments,
as delineated in the project level tables in
this explanatory statement, to initiate the
competitive development of NGI while main-
taining and enhancing existing homeland de-
fense capabilities against near- and mid-
term threats prior to the fielding of NGI.
It is expected that with submission of the
fiscal year 2021 budget request, the Adminis-
tration will have concluded its evaluation of
interceptor options. Therefore, the Director
of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is di-
rected to submit to the congressional defense
committees, with the submission of the fis-
cal year 2021 budget request, MDA’s strategy
for the Nation’s homeland defense in the
near-, mid-, and far-term, to include acquisi-
tion strategies for each element of the archi-
tecture, manufacturing and technology read-
iness levels, contract-type determinations
and rationales therefor, plans for technical
data management, sustainment strategies,
integrated master test plans and integrated
master schedules, as well as cost estimates.
Further, the Secretary of Defense is di-
rected to select an appropriate entity out-
side the Department of Defense to conduct
an independent review and assessment of the
current and planned United States homeland
defense architecture against near-, mid-, and
far-term threats. At a minimum, such review
shall address operational effectiveness and
reliability of the current system; force struc-
ture and inventory levels necessary to
achieve the planned capabilities; the strat-
egy for the development, production, testing,
deployment, modernization and sustainment
of the architecture; technology and manufac-
turing readiness levels required to imple-
ment the architecture; and industrial base
readiness to support this architecture. It is
further directed that such review shall be
submitted to the congressional defense com-
mittees not later than 180 days after the en-
actment of this Act. In addition, the Direc-
tor, Cost Assessment and Program Evalua-
tion is directed to submit to the congres-
sional defense committees an independent
cost assessment of this architecture not
later than 30 days after submission of the re-
view to the congressional defense commit-
tees.
This language replaces language under the
header ‘‘Redesigned Kill Vehicle Program
Termination and Development of Next Gen-
eration Interceptor’’ in Senate Report 116–
103.

REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR THE DEFENSE
HEALTH PROGRAM
(INCLUDING BASE AND OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY
OPERATIONS FUNDING)
The agreement directs that the In-House
Care and Private Sector Care budget sub-ac-
tivities remain designated as congressional
special interest items. Any transfer of funds
into or out of these sub-activities requires
the Secretary of Defense to follow prior ap-
proval reprogramming procedures. The Sec-
retary of Defense is further directed to pro-
vide a report to the congressional defense
committees not later than 30 days after the
enactment of this Act that delineates trans-
fers of funds and the dates any transfers oc-
curred from the Private Sector Care budget
sub-activity to any other budget sub-activity
in fiscal year 2019.
The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health
Affairs) is directed to provide quarterly
briefings to the congressional defense com-
mittees on budget execution data for all of
the Defense Health Program budget activi-
ties not later than 30 days after the end of
each fiscal quarter and to adequately reflect
changes to the budget activities requested by
the Services in future budget submissions.
The agreement recognizes the shortfall in
excess of $700,000,000 experienced in the exe-
cution of Private Sector Care in fiscal year
2019 and consequently includes only modest
reductions to the fiscal year 2020 Private
Sector Care budget request. This language
replaces the language under the headings

ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS
The agreement highlights legislative lan-
guage directing the Secretary of Defense to
provide quarterly reports to the congres-
sional defense committees on the status of
the deployment of the electronic health
record. These reports, directed to be sub-
mitted not later than 30 days after the end of
each fiscal quarter, shall include the cost
and schedule of the program, to include
milestones, knowledge points, and acquisi-
tion timelines, as well as quarterly obliga-
tion reports. These reports should also be
provided to the Government Accountability
Office. It is expected that the House and Sen-
ate Appropriations Committees continue to

formance reviews by providing the Comp-
troller General with regular and in-depth ac-
cess to the program.
The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisi-
tion and Sustainment) is directed to brief
the congressional defense committees not
later than 30 days after the full deployment
decision on the results of the Full Oper-
ational Test and Evaluation. Additionally,

AIR FORCE FLYING HOUR FUNDING EXECUTION
FOR OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS
The review of the fiscal year 2020 budget
request uncovered some disturbing data
points that have called the budget formula-
tion process for flying hours in the overseas
contingency operations (OCO) request into
question. Budget execution data revealed
that the Air Force moved approximately
$594,000,000 in fiscal year 2018 and $695,000,000
in fiscal year 2019 from OCO flying hours to
other OCO expenses. It is acknowledged that
budgetary requirements change, perhaps
even more so with the dynamic nature of
overseas contingency operations. Accord-
ingly, the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees provide flexibility for these
emerging requirements by providing proce-
dures on how the Services are able to make
budgetary realignments. However, the Air
Force has chosen to apply these procedures
differently than intended. This means that
over $1,289,000,000 of OCO funding has been
spent by the Air Force over the past two fis-
cal years on unbudgeted expenses. Frustrat-
ingly, it was only after the fact that the con-
gressional defense committees found out
what was purchased with the asset provided
from the flying hour account.
The fact that the Air Force has moved
roughly 25 percent from the OCO flying hour
funding request for each of the past two
years indicates more of a fundamental issue
with the initial request as opposed to an
anomaly. Therefore, the agreement includes
a new reduction to the Air Force OCO flying
hours funding request to more closely align
with historical execution.
COUNTER-ISIS TRAIN AND EQUIP FUND
The agreement continues support under
this heading for the Iraqi Security Forces,
Kurdish Peshmerga, and the Syrian Demo-
cratic Forces to participate in activities to
counter ISIS and their associated groups.
The agreement does not include funding for
Iraqi security forces that are not engaged in
such activities and continues the require-
ment that the Secretary of Defense ensure
elements are appropriately vetted and re-
ceiving commitments from them to promote
respect for human rights and the rule of law.
The Secretary of Defense has not fully
complied with the quarterly reporting re-
quirements under this heading in the Depart-
ment of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019 (di-
vision A of Public Law 115—245) and is di-
rected to submit all overdue reports not
later than 45 days after the enactment of
this Act.
JORDAN
The agreement includes funding at levels
consistent with prior years for Jordan.
PROCUREMENT
The agreement provides $11,793,461,000 for
Procurement, as follows:

PROPRIATIONS ACT, 2020
Report language included in House Report
116–101 (‘‘the House report’’) or Senate Re-
port 116–127 (‘‘the Senate report’’) that is not
changed by this explanatory statement or
the Act is approved. The explanatory state-
ment, while repeating some language for em-
phasis, is not intended to negate the lan-
guage referred to above unless expressly pro-
vided herein. In cases where both the House
report and the Senate report address a par-
ticular issue not specifically addressed in the
explanatory statement, the House report and
the Senate report should be read as con-
sistent and are to be interpreted accordingly.
In cases where the House report or the Sen-
ate report directs the submission of a report,
such report is to be submitted to both the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions (‘‘the Committees’’).
Each department and agency funded in this
Act shall follow the directions set forth in
this Act and the accompanying explanatory
statement, and shall not reallocate resources
or reorganize activities except as provided
herein. Reprogramming procedures shall
apply to: funds provided in this Act; unobli-
gated balances from previous appropriations
Acts that are available for obligation or ex-
penditure in fiscal year 2020; and non-appro-
priated resources such as fee collections that
are used to meet program requirements in
fiscal year 2020. These procedures are speci-
fied in section 505 of this Act.
Any reprogramming request shall include
any out-year budgetary impacts and a sepa-
rate accounting of program or mission im-
pacts on estimated carryover funds. Any pro-
gram, project, or activity cited in this ex-
planatory statement, or in the House report
or the Senate report and not changed by this
Act, shall be construed as the position of the
Congress and shall not be subject to reduc-
tions or reprogramming without prior ap-
proval of the Committees. Further, any de-
partment or agency funded in this Act that
plans a reduction-in-force shall notify the
Committees by letter no later than 30 days
in advance of the date of any such planned
personnel action.
When a department or agency submits a
reprogramming or transfer request to the
Committees and does not receive identical
responses, it shall be the responsibility of
the department or agency seeking the re-
programming to reconcile the differences be-
tween the two bodies before proceeding. If
reconciliation is not possible, the items in
disagreement in the reprogramming or
transfer request shall be considered unap-
proved. Departments and agencies shall not
submit reprogramming notifications after
July 1, 2020, except in extraordinary cir-
cumstances. Any such notification shall in-
clude a description of the extraordinary cir-
cumstances.
In compliance with section 528 of this Act,
each department and agency funded in this
Act shall submit spending plans, signed by
the respective department or agency head,
for the Committees’ review not later than 45
days after enactment of this Act.

prospective grantees with the goal of ensur-
ing increased quality and quantity of appli-
cations for assistance aimed at benefitting
residents of persistent poverty counties or
high-poverty areas, as defined in the House
language. The agreement further modifies
this language to direct the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO), in coordination
with EDA, to provide a report to the Com-
mittees on the percentage of funds allocated
by each program in fiscal years 2017, 2018,
and 2019, and estimates for fiscal year 2020,

ditional Business Center program and Spe-
cialty Project Center program. The agree-
ment provides $7,000,000 for the Broad Agen-
cy Announcements (BAA) program. Senate
language on BAAs is not adopted. However,
the Committees are concerned about the
scope of the 2019 BAA topic areas and direct
MBDA to submit a spend plan, which in-

the Committees for these funds 30 days prior

In lieu of House report language regarding
the Bureau’s anticipated report on the feasi-
bility of including Puerto Rico in additional

the Bureau to provide a supplement to this
report, not later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act, containing an overall cost
estimate and implementation plan for Puer-
to Rico’s inclusion in these surveys and

rent Surveys and Programs account of the
Bureau of the Census, to include funds to
continue the level of effort for the Survey of

scribed in the House report. The agreement

The bill provides $7,284,319,000 for the Peri-

2020 Decennial Census.—In July 2019, the
Census Bureau provided an update to the
Committees on its 2020 Census Life Cycle
Cost Estimate. While the total estimates for
the overall Decennial costs remain un-
changed, the Census Bureau assumes effi-
ciencies in the program allow for a greater
contingency reserve to support potential
risks. The agreement provides $6,696,000,000
for the Decennial Census and does not adopt
House recommended levels for the key oper-
ational frames, as described in the House re-
port. The agreement includes $669,000,000
dedicated towards Secretarial contingency
needs that may arise during the Census oper-
ation such as major disasters or other un-
foreseen risks realized, and $263,000,000 in ad-
ditional sensitivity risks to support addi-
tional pay increases and any reduction in
self-response rates beyond the current pro-
jections of the Census Bureau. The agree-
ment clarifies a previous requirement re-
garding the notification to the Committees
on the obligation of funds within the Bu-
reau’s contingency reserve and directs the
Census Bureau to report to the Committees
no later than 15 days after any obligation of
such funds. Such report shall include a de-
scription of the work funded from this re-
serve during the fiscal year. The agreement
also supports no less than the level of effort
for outreach and communications that was
utilized in preparation for the 2010 Decennial
Census, adjusted for inflation.
Mobile Questionnaire Assistance Centers.—
Within funds provided, the agreement directs
the Census Bureau to support this new ini-
tiative aimed at increasing response in his-
torically undercounted and hard to count
communities. As part of the report on out-
reach activities in hard to count commu-
nities as directed by the House, the Census
Bureau shall include details on how the Mo-
bile Questionnaire Assistance Centers will be
utilized as a part of these efforts.
Quarterly Briefing.—The agreement con-
tinues the requirement for quarterly updates
from the Census Bureau to ensure the Com-
mittees are regularly apprised of the status
of the 2020 Decennial operations, Census sys-
tems readiness, Census Enterprise Data Col-
lection and Processing, implementation of
GAO recommendations, and the American
Community Survey. As part of these brief-
ings, the Census Bureau should also include
updates on actions it is taking, along with
the Department of Homeland Security, to se-
cure the online platform and personal data,
as described in the House report, as well as
work the agency has done to mitigate risks
identified by GAO, as referenced in the Sen-
ate report.
NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND
INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $40,441,000 for the

Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions.—In
lieu of House report language regarding OLC,

rect OLC to publish all legal opinions and

ceedings in detention facilities and ensure
court appearances by non-detained individ-
uals. EOIR shall continue to hire the most
qualified IJs from a diverse pool of can-
didates to ensure the adjudication process is
impartial and consistent with due process. In
lieu of the House language on alternatives to
detention programs, the Committees believe
that consistent policies regarding docket
management and case adjudication will re-
duce the impending backlog. EOIR is di-
rected to continue to prioritize cases that
are scheduled on the detained docket.
EOIR shall continue to submit monthly
performance and operating reports detailing
the backlog of cases and the hiring of new IJ
teams in the same format and detail pro-
vided in Senate Report 115–275 and codified
in Public Law 116–6. These reports shall con-
tinue to include statistics regarding the

evant factor and the median days pending for
both detained and non-detained cases. These
reports shall also list IJs who are tempo-
rarily deployed away from their permanent
courtrooms, noting the permanent and tem-
porary duty stations of each IJ and the
length of such temporary duty assignments.
To the extent that EOIR has adopted new
performance measures related to the effi-
cient and timely completion of cases and
motions, statistics reflecting those measures
shall be included in the report. Finally, these
reports shall now also include the cost break
out for IJ teams, as detailed in the Senate
report.
Videoteleconferencing (VTC) Data and Re-
porting.—The Committees direct EOIR to
collect real-time data indicating each time a
master calendar or individual merits hearing
is conducted via VTC to allow for better sta-
tistical data collection to help determine
whether VTC has an outcome determinative
impact. This information is to be provided in
the quarterly reports submitted to the Com-
mittees and should include the number and
type of hearings conducted by VTC, includ-
ing data on appeals cases related to the use
of VTC, and the number of in-person hearing
motions filed. EOIR shall make publicly
available all policies and procedures related
to EOIR’s use of VTC, including policies and
procedures for EOIR’s new immigration adju-
dication centers. Any deviations from
EOIR’s VTC standard policy and procedures
shall be noted and justified in the EOIR’s
quarterly report to the Committees.
Legal Orientation Program (LOP).—The
agreement includes $18,000,000 for services
provided by the LOP, of which $3,000,000 is
for the Immigration Help Desk. LOP funding
is also provided for LOP for Custodians

ibly troubling to learn about the new restric-
tion to not fund more than two discretionary
awards to one entity as either the lead or
sub-recipient grantee as part of OVW’s grant
solicitations for fiscal year 2020. This change
will severely disadvantage small states;
rural communities; tribal communities; and
organizations providing services to special-
ized populations, which could limit access to
critical victim services. While the Depart-
ment has been directed to reduce program
duplication, this restriction is not the appro-
priate way to accomplish that goal, and

H10990 December 17, 2019
DIVISION C—FINANCIAL SERVICES AND
GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIA-
TIONS ACT, 2020
The joint explanatory statement accom-
panying this division is approved and indi-
cates congressional intent. Unless otherwise
noted, the language set forth in House Re-
port 116–122 and Senate Report 116–111 carries
the same weight as language included in this
joint explanatory statement and should be
complied with unless specifically addressed
to the contrary in this joint explanatory
statement. While some language is repeated
for emphasis, it is not intended to negate the
language referred to above unless expressly
provided herein.
Reports.—Where the House or Senate has
directed submission of a report, that report
is to be submitted to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of the House and Senate. Agen-
cies funded by this Act that currently pro-
vide separate copies of periodic reports and
correspondence to the chairs and ranking
members of the House and Senate Appropria-
tions Committees and Subcommittees on Fi-
nancial Services and General Government
are directed to use a single cover letter
jointly addressed to the chairs and ranking
members of the Committees and Subcommit-
tees of both the House and the Senate. To
the greatest extent feasible, agencies should
include in the cover letter a reference or
hyperlink to facilitate electronic access to
the report and provide the documents by
electronic mail delivery. These measures
will help reduce costs, conserve paper, expe-
dite agency processing, and ensure that con-
sistent information is conveyed concurrently
to the majority and minority committee of-
fices of both chambers of Congress.
Pursuant to section 608, agencies funded by
this bill are required to consult the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of the House and the
Senate prior to any significant reorganiza-
tion, restructuring, relocation, or closing of
offices, programs, or activities. These deci-
sions have the potential to impact funding
needs in future years and may conflict with
the rationale behind the appropriated levels
in the current year; therefore, these actions,
particularly those that entail out-year im-
pacts, merit advanced engagement with the
Committees. Should any questions arise re-
lating to the applicability of these provi-
sions to a potential action or decision, agen-
cies are expected to confer with the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of the House and Sen-
ate prior to completing the decision-making
process. The agreement also clarifies that re-
organizations or consolidations of programs
or offices that entail relocating a material
number of employees to a different locality
pay area are significant for the purposes of
section 608.
The agreement notes concerns regarding
excessive spending on Federal furniture in
previous fiscal years by executive agency
heads without proper notification to the
Committees on Appropriations of the House
and the Senate. Federal agencies are ex-
pected to comply with the provisions in sec-
tion 710 of this bill.

LAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT,
2020
The following is an explanation of Division
D, which makes appropriations for the De-
partment of Homeland Security (DHS) for
fiscal year 2020. Funding provided in this
agreement not only sustains existing pro-
grams that protect the nation from all man-
ner of threats, it ensures DHS’s ability to
improve preparedness at the federal, state,
local, tribal, and territorial levels; prevent
and respond to terrorist attacks; and hire,
train, and equip DHS frontline forces pro-
tecting the homeland.
Unless otherwise noted, references to the
House and Senate reports are to House Re-
port 116–180 and Senate Report 116–125, re-
spectively. The language and allocations
contained in the House and Senate reports
carry the same weight as the language in-
cluded in this explanatory statement unless
specifically addressed to the contrary in the
bill or this explanatory statement. While
this explanatory statement repeats some
language from the House or Senate reports
for emphasis, it does not negate the language
contained in those reports unless expressly
stated. When this explanatory statement re-
fers to the Committees or the Committees on
Appropriations, these references are to the
House Appropriations Subcommittee on
Homeland Security and the Senate Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Homeland Secu-
rity.
This explanatory statement refers to cer-
tain laws, organizations, persons, funds, and
documents as follows: the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act, Public Law 93–288, is referenced as the
Stafford Act; the Department of Homeland
Security is referenced as DHS or the Depart-
ment; the Government Accountability Office
is referenced as GAO; and the Office of In-
spector General of the Department of Home-
land Security is referenced as OIG. In addi-
tion, ‘‘full-time equivalents’’ are referred to
as FTE; ‘‘full-time positions’’ are referred to
as FTP; ‘‘Information Technology’’ is re-
ferred to as IT; the DHS ‘‘Working Capital
Fund’’ is referred to as WCF; ‘‘program,
project, and activity’’ is referred to as PPA;
any reference to ‘‘the Secretary’’ should be
interpreted to mean the Secretary of Home-
land Security; ‘‘component’’ should be inter-
preted to mean an agency, administration,
or directorate within DHS; any reference to
SLTT should be interpreted to mean State,
Local, Tribal, and territorial; and ‘‘budget
request’’ or ‘‘the request’’ should be inter-
preted to mean the budget of the U.S. Gov-
ernment for fiscal year 2020 that was sub-
mitted to Congress on March 11, 2019.
TITLE I—DEPARTMENTAL MANAGE-
MENT, OPERATIONS, INTELLIGENCE,
AND OVERSIGHT
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY AND EXECUTIVE
MANAGEMENT
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
The agreement includes an increase for Op-
erations and Support of $27,498,000 above the
budget request, including increases of:
$2,900,000 for the Office for Civil Rights and
Civil Liberties for the Compliance Branch;
$7,500,000 for the Office of Strategy Policy
and Plans for a community awareness and
training program and activities related to
targeted violence and terrorism prevention
grants funded through Federal Assistance;
$10,000,000 for the establishment of a new Of-
fice of Immigration Detention Ombudsman;
and $7,548,000 to sustain fiscal year 2019 oper-
ational levels, including adjusted personnel
costs and the Immigration Data Integration
Initiative.
Chief Medical Officer (CMO).—As the pri-
mary DHS medical authority, the CMO has
oversight responsibility for the Depart-
ment’s medical and public health policies
and operations. As such, DHS is directed to
ensure that the CMO reviews all contracts
that broadly impact how the Department de-
livers healthcare to individuals in its cus-
tody and to departmental personnel. In co-
ordination with operational components, the
CMO shall develop departmental require-
ments for medical services, to include profes-
sional healthcare system administration;
disease surveillance, reporting, and outbreak
response; and measurable performance
standards for current and future healthcare
record systems. The CMO, in conjunction
with operational component leadership as
appropriate, is directed to brief the Commit-
tees within 90 days of the date of enactment
of this Act on these efforts.
Medical Strategy.—In fiscal year 2019, near-
ly 1,000,000 migrants were apprehended by
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, result-
ing in an unprecedented medical screening
and healthcare crisis. As the Department re-
sponded, it became clear that a more cohe-
sive strategy was necessary to address emer-
gent medical conditions of detainees, as well
as the health of its own workforce. Based on
lessons learned from this experience, the
Secretary shall develop a DHS-wide medical
response strategy for emergent cir-
cumstances, including surges in migration,
National Special Security Events, Special
Event Assessment Rating events, and Staf-
ford Act-declared disasters. The strategy
should also clarify the roles and responsibil-
ities of DHS medical personnel; the need for
any new legal authorizations; and any reor-
ganization requirements, as appropriate.
Office of Immigration Detention Ombuds-
man.—The agreement establishes an Immi-
gration Detention Ombudsman position and
provides $10,000,000 for an Office of Immigra-
tion Detention Ombudsman, as described in
the House Report. The bill withholds $500,000
from the Office of the Secretary for Execu-
tive Management (OSEM) until the Sec-
retary approves the Ombudsman.
Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans.—The
agreement includes a realignment of
$2,800,000 from the Office of Partnership and
Engagement for the new Office of Terrorism
Prevention Partnerships (OTPP). OTPP is di-
rected to brief the Committees within 30
days of the date of enactment of this Act on
its programs and activities, including its
plans for carrying out local community
awareness and training, and for the use of
funding provided under Management Direc-
torate—Federal Assistance for targeted vio-
lence and terrorism prevention grants.
Public Complaint and Feedback System Work-
ing Group.—The Department has not fulfilled
a requirement in House Report 116–9 to pro-
vide semi-annual updates to the Committees
on the Public Complaint and Feedback Sys-
tem Working Group. The Department is di-
rected to begin providing such updates not
later than 60 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act. The bill withholds $500,000
from OSEM until the Department provides
the first such update, which must address
the requirements detailed in House Report
114–668.
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $10,000,000 for tar-
geted violence and terrorism prevention
grants, to be transferred to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency for pur-
poses of administration.
MANAGEMENT DIRECTORATE
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
The agreement includes an increase for Op-
erations and Support of $6,152,000 above the
budget request to sustain fiscal year 2019
operational levels, including personnel cost
adjustments.
The Department is directed to refrain from
initiating new PPAs for which funds have
not been provided in an appropriations act,
either explicitly or based on a funding re-
quest, if such PPAs would have significant
resource requirements beyond the budget
year. When emergent circumstances other-
wise require the initiation of significant
PPAs, the Department is directed to provide
advance notification to the Committees,
along with a detailed justification for why
they are required.
PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND
IMPROVEMENTS
The agreement provides the requested ap-
propriation for the proposed activities under
Procurement, Construction, and Improve-
ments.
INTELLIGENCE, ANALYSIS, AND OPERATIONS
COORDINATION
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
The agreement provides an increase of
$7,500,000 above the budget request for elec-
tion security. A total of $68,579,000 is avail-
able until September 30, 2021.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
The agreement includes an increase for Op-
erations and Support of $20,000,000 above the
budget request for increased monitoring and
oversight of border security and immigration
enforcement activities.
TITLE I—ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
Section 101. The agreement continues a
provision requiring the Inspector General to
review grants and contracts awarded by
means other than full and open competition
and report the results to the Committees.
Section 102. The agreement continues a
provision requiring the Chief Financial Offi-
cer to submit monthly budget execution and
staffing reports within 30 days after the close
of each month.
Section 103. The agreement continues a
provision directing the Secretary to require
contracts providing award fees to link such
fees to successful acquisition outcomes.
Section 104. The agreement continues a
provision requiring the Secretary, in con-
junction with the Secretary of the Treasury,
to notify the Committees of any proposed
transfers from the Department of Treasury
Forfeiture Fund to any agency at DHS. No
funds may be obligated prior to such notifi-
cation.
Section 105. The agreement continues a
provision related to official travel costs of
the Secretary and Deputy Secretary.
Section 106. The agreement includes a pro-
vision establishing an Immigration Deten-
tion Ombudsman.
Section 107. The agreement continues a
provision requiring the Secretary to submit
a report on visa overstay data and to post
border security metrics on the Department’s
website.
TITLE II—SECURITY, ENFORCEMENT, AND
INVESTIGATIONS
U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION
OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT
The agreement provides $12,735,399,000 for
Operations and Support of U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP), which includes
$203,000,000 of prior year emergency funding
and of which $500,000,000 is available until
September 30, 2021. This emergency funding
is fully offset by the rescission of unneeded
prior year balances of emergency funding.
The bill includes increases above the budget
request, including the following: $99,774,000
to sustain prior year initiatives and for per-
sonnel cost adjustments; $13,000,000 for Bor-
der Patrol Processing Coordinator positions;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H11016 December 17, 2019
$56,656,000 for Office of Field Operations staff;
$19,651,000 for agriculture specialists;
$25,000,000 for innovative technology;
$1,500,000 for comprehensive testing of im-
ported honey; $5,000,000 for tribal roads;
$2,000,000 for rescue beacons; $2,000,000 for en-
terprise geospatial improvement services;
$20,000,000 for port of entry technology;
$3,000,000 for trade enhancements; $2,000,000
for NAFTA Centers; $5,000,000 to increase Air
and Marine flight hours, bringing the total
to $15,000,000 and to include the use of con-
tracted pilots; and $21,000,000 for body worn
cameras. The agreement includes a reduc-
tion below the request of $45,000,000 associ-
ated with administrative contract savings
for Enterprise Services, $82,218,000 for hu-
manitarian care to be offset with prior year
emergency funding and provides no funding
for additional Border Patrol agents.
The account total reflects a rescission and
re-appropriation of prior year discretionary
and emergency funds, which shall be obli-
gated for humanitarian care, to include
consumables and medical care, electronic
health records, and to address health, life
and safety issues at existing Border Patrol
facilities, including construction and for im-
proved video recording capabilities.
The agreement includes technical budget
realignments, as requested by DHS.
Border Patrol Processing Coordinators.—The
bill includes $13,000,000 for Border Patrol
processing coordinators. Prior to the execu-
tion of funds, CBP shall brief the Commit-
tees on the training requirements for these
new positions, which should include but not
be limited to emergency medical and mental
health care; migrant legal rights; Traf-
ficking Victims Protection Reauthorization
Act requirements; and how to identify child
abuse and neglect. The briefing should also
address the total cost of such training and
identify the location where training will
occur.
Custody and Transfer Metrics.—The agree-
ment requires data reporting on migrants in
CBP custody, including data on utilization
rates for all short term holding facilities and
on the designated removal mechanisms for
migrants. CBP shall publish on a publicly ac-
cessible website the following on a semi-
monthly basis: the number of migrants de-
tained in CBP facilities broken out by sec-
tor, field office, temporary spaces, humani-
tarian care centers, and central processing
centers; and the utilization rates of all such
facilities. On a monthly basis, CBP shall
publish the number of migrants transferred
out of CBP custody, delineated by transfer
destination and, in the case of removal, the
removal mechanism.
Electronic Visa Update System (EVUS).—The
bill restores $13,850,000 of the $27,661,000 re-
duction in the budget request to EVUS. CBP
is strongly encouraged to work with the ap-
propriate authorizing committees to get fee
authority for EVUS. Non-immigrant visa
holders who benefit from this program, not
U.S. taxpayers, should pay for EVUS.
Gordie Howe International Bridge.—The
funding level for Gordie Howe International
Bridge is funded at the requested level, and
shall be obligated as proposed in the request,
in the Operations and Support account and
in Procurement, Construction, and Improve-
ments.
Innovative Technology.—At least 15 days
prior to the obligation of funds for innova-
tive border security technology, CBP is di-
rected to brief the Committees on the
planned obligation of funds. The briefing
shall also identify the component sponsor
and plans for transitioning technologies to
the field. Funding in the bill for such tech-
nology shall not exceed $5,000,000 for any in-
dividual project.
Intelligent Enforcement and Opioids.—The
funding levels for Intelligent Enforcement
and opioids are funded at the requested lev-
els and shall be obligated as proposed in the
budget request.
Medical Guidance.—The CBP Commissioner
issued an interim directive on enhanced
medical care to help address the growing in-
flux of migrants crossing the southern bor-
der. In conjunction with the DHS CMO, CBP
is directed to issue a permanent medical di-
rective and implementing guidance, which
shall include the following:
∑ Clear definitions, metrics, automated re-
porting requirements, and formal mecha-
nisms for coordinating with the CMO on
making determinations that conditions at
the border constitute a public health crisis,
which should take into consideration: time
in custody; holding facility capacity limits;
emerging disease outbreaks, such as influ-
enza; and the readiness of each U.S. Border
Patrol and Office of Field Operations facil-
ity. These metrics shall be reported on a
common operating picture such as the Uni-
fied Immigration Portal;
∑ Response plans for public health crisis
conditions that include: a convalescence cen-
ter concept, executed in concert with the
CMO and the U.S. Public Health Service; the
provision of vaccinations when deemed ap-
propriate by the CMO; and emergency mech-
anisms to address overcrowding at Border
Patrol and port of entry facilities through
custodial transfers to Immigration and Cus-
toms Enforcement, and the Office of Refugee
Resettlement, as appropriate; and
∑ A peer review process for deaths in cus-
tody, including: first level review by the CBP
Senior Medical Advisor; second level review
convened by the CMO; and external review,
as appropriate through an enterprise-level
contract executed by the CMO.
Not later than 90 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the CMO, in conjunction
with appropriate CBP leadership, shall brief
the Committees on an implementation plan
for the permanent directive. Additionally,
the final guidance and associated imple-
menting guidance shall be made available on
a publicly accessible website not later than
15 days after such guidance is finalized.
Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).—DHS
shall establish goals and metrics for assess-
ing the effectiveness of the MPP Program.
Metrics shall include the following daily
data for migrants entering the United
States, by location: the total number of en-
tering migrants apprehended or deemed in-
admissible; the number of such migrants
amenable to MPP; the number of amenable
migrants who assert a fear of returning to
Mexico; the number of migrants assigned to
MPP appearing at a port of entry to attend
immigration adjudication proceedings and
the outcomes of such proceedings, including
data on the number of removals ordered in
absentia; the number of migrants assigned to
MPP who remain overnight in the United

was requested to sustain prior year initia-
tives that were not funded in the fiscal year
2019 appropriation, nor does it include

Further, ICE is directed to provide its offi-
cers with guidance and training for engaging
with victims of crime and witnesses of crime,

ing an increase of $93,382,000 for personnel
cost adjustments. The agreement rejects the
airline passenger fee increase proposed by
TSA, which would have offset the total ap-
propriation by an estimated $550,000,000, thus
making the net increase in discretionary
spending above the request $1,115,370,000.

Elizabeth City Air Station.—The bill does
not provide funding for enhancements to the
runway at the Elizabeth City Coast Guard
Air Station. The Coast Guard has estimated
the total project cost would exceed
$23,000,000, far above the level recommended
in the Senate bill. The Coast Guard shall
work with state and local partners, including
institutions of higher learning, to determine
the full scope and cost of mutually beneficial
enhancements to Runway 1/19, and explore
the potential for sharing costs necessary to
ensure the project is completed in an effi-

of enactment of this Act on the scope, costs,
and benefits of the project, including the via-
bility of a financial partnership with non-

construct the OPC was recently amended to
address increased cost estimates after the
Acting Secretary determined that relief per-
mitted under Public Law 85–804 was appro-
priate and necessary to the national defense.
An associated delay in delivery of the first
two hulls reduced the fiscal year 2020 re-
quirement for the OPC by $145,000,000. Funds
included in the agreement continue nec-
essary program requirements. The agree-

request for CISA to expedite national cyber-
security education, training, and workforce
development efforts to build a cybersecurity
workforce as a national security asset. CISA
is directed to develop a consolidated plan
that defines a path to educate the cybersecu-
rity workforce of the future and develop con-
tent that includes partnering with at least
two academic institutions of higher edu-
cation to cultivate a non-traditional work-
force, focused on reaching rural, minority,
gender diverse, and veteran populations.
These efforts could include cybersecurity
competitions and associated costs to identify
cyber excellence throughout the nation and
within the Federal government. The plan
should also clearly articulate measurable
outcomes for how efforts comply with Execu-
tive Order 13800 and its resulting rec-
ommendations. This program is subject to
the briefing requirements described above.
To address the requirements described in
the House and Senate Reports, a briefing
shall be provided in collaboration with the

brief the Committees on its plan for the pro-
gram, to include: its process for choosing
which vendors, if any, will be used to support
the program; its process for choosing which
industrial control system owner operators
will be selected to participate in the pro-
gram; and the performance measures that
will be used to evaluate the program. Fur-
ther, CISA is directed to include as a part of
its program, an assessment of the state of
the market to meet the capabilities sought
by this pilot program and an evaluation of
any market advancements required to meet
such demands.

input provided by SLTT has been incor-
porated; how the needs of mitigation part-
ners will be met; and how innovation and in-
centives will be incorporated into the pro-
gram. Further, the briefing shall include a
timeframe for documenting a clear policy on
how FEMA will account for variations in
funding levels based on the nature of
NPIPMA being a percentage of disaster
spending. The policy should ensure SLTT
can plan for effective projects by avoiding
disruptive fluctuations in funding levels.
Last, the briefing shall include a clear plan
for how FEMA can best use funds recovered
from previous PDM projects, with a clear de-
scription of the amount and source of the

ments.
The Department must notify the Commit-
tees on Appropriations prior to each re-
programming of funds that would reduce pro-
grams, projects, activities, or personnel by
ten percent or more. Notifications are also
required for each reprogramming of funds
that would increase a program, project, or

cent, whichever is less. The Department
must submit these notifications to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations at least 15 days in
advance of any such reprogramming.

cific purpose in this statement. Also, for pur-
poses of reprogramming notifications, the
creation of a new program, project, or activ-
ity is defined as any significant new activity
that has not been explicitly justified to the
Congress in budget justification material
and for which funds have not been appro-
priated by the Congress. For further guid-
ance when determining which movements of
funds are subject to section 503, the Depart-
ment is reminded to follow GAO’s definition
of ‘‘program, project, or activity’’ as detailed
in the GAO’s A Glossary of Terms Used in the
Federal Budget Process. Within 30 days of the
date of enactment of this Act, the Depart-
ment shall submit to the Committees a table
delineating PPAs subject to section 503 noti-
fication requirements, as defined in this
paragraph.

accounts by more than five percent or in-
crease accounts by more than ten percent.
The Committees on Appropriations must be
notified not fewer than 30 days in advance of
any transfer.
To avoid violations of the Anti-Deficiency
Act, the Secretary shall ensure that any
transfer of funds is carried out in compliance
with the limitations and requirements of
section 503(b). In particular, the Secretary
should ensure that any such transfers adhere
to the opinion of the Comptroller General’s
decision in the Matter of: John D. Webster, Di-
rector, Financial Services, Library of Congress,
dated November 7, 1997, with regard to the def-
inition of an appropriation subject to trans-
fer limitations.
The Department shall submit notifications
on a timely basis and provide complete ex-
planations of the proposed reallocations, in-
cluding detailed justifications for the in-
creases and offsets, and any specific impact
the proposed changes would have on the
budget request for the following fiscal year
and future-year appropriations require-
ments. Each notification submitted to the
Committees should include a detailed table
showing the proposed revisions to funding
and FTE – at the account, program, project,
and activity level – for the current fiscal
year, along with any funding and FTE im-
pacts on the budget year.
The Department shall manage its pro-
grams, projects, and activities within the
levels appropriated, and should only submit
reprogramming or transfer notifications in
cases of unforeseeable and compelling cir-
cumstances that could not have been pre-
dicted when formulating the budget request
for the current fiscal year. When the Depart-
ment submits a reprogramming or transfer
notification and does not receive identical
responses from the House and Senate Com-
mittees, it is expected to reconcile the dif-
ferences before proceeding.
The Department is not to submit a re-
programming or transfer notification after
June 30 except in extraordinary cir-
cumstances that imminently threaten the
safety of human life or the protection of
property. If an above-threshold reprogram-
ming or a transfer is needed after June 30,
the notification should contain sufficient
documentation as to why it meets this statu-
tory exception.
Deobligated funds are also subject to the
reprogramming and transfer limitations and
requirements set forth in section 503.
Section 503(f) authorizes the Secretary to
transfer up to $20,000,000 to address immigra-
tion emergencies after notifying the Com-
mittees of such transfer at least five days in
advance.
Section 504. The agreement continues a
provision by reference, prohibiting funds ap-
propriated or otherwise made available to
the Department to make payment to the
WCF, except for activities and amounts al-
lowed in the President’s fiscal year 2020
budget request. Funds provided to the WCF
are available until expended. The Depart-
ment can only charge components for direct
usage of the WCF and these funds may be
used only for the purposes consistent with
the contributing component. Any funds paid
in advance or for reimbursement must re-
flect the full cost of each service. The De-
partment shall submit a notification prior to
adding a new activity to the fund or elimi-
nating an existing activity from the fund.
For activities added to the fund, such notifi-
cations shall detail the source of funds by
PPA. In addition, the Department shall sub-
mit quarterly WCF execution reports to the
Committees that include activity level de-
tail.
Section 505. The agreement continues a
provision providing that not to exceed 50 per-
cent of unobligated balances from prior-year
appropriations for each Operations and Sup-
port appropriation, shall remain available
through fiscal year 2021, subject to section
503 reprogramming requirements.
Section 506. The agreement continues a
provision that deems intelligence activities
to be specifically authorized during fiscal
year 2020 until the enactment of an Act au-
thorizing intelligence activities for fiscal
year 2020.
Section 507. The agreement continues a
provision requiring notification to the Com-
mittees at least three days before DHS exe-
cutes or announces grant allocations; grant
awards; contract awards, including contracts
covered by the Federal Acquisition Regula-
tion; other transaction agreements; letters
of intent; task or delivery orders on multiple
contract awards totaling $1,000,000 or more;
task or delivery orders greater than
$10,000,000 from multi-year funds; or sole-
source grant awards. Notifications shall in-
clude a description of the project or projects
or activities to be funded and the location,
including city, county, and state. If the Sec-
retary determines that compliance would
pose substantial risk to health, human life,
or safety, an award may be made without
prior notification but the Committees shall
be notified within 5 full business days after
such award or letter is issued.
Section 508. The agreement continues a
provision prohibiting all agencies from pur-
chasing, constructing, or leasing additional
facilities for federal law enforcement train-
ing without advance notification to the Com-
mittees.
Section 509. The agreement continues a

provision regarding the oath of allegiance re-
quired by section 337 of the Immigration and

Section 513. The agreement continues a
provision that precludes DHS from using
funds in this Act to carry out reorganization
authority. This prohibition is not intended
to prevent the Department from carrying
out routine or small reallocations of per-
sonnel or functions within components, sub-
ject to section 503 of this Act. This section
prevents large-scale reorganization of the
Department, which should be acted on legis-
latively by the relevant congressional com-
mittees of jurisdiction. Any DHS proposal to
reorganize components that is included as
part of a budget request will be considered
by the Committees.
Section 514. The agreement continues a
provision prohibiting funds for planning,
testing, piloting, or developing a national
