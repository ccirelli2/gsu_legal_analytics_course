Today, Lord, on the 75th anniversary
of D-Day, we remember the sacrifices
that were made for our freedom.
Lord, we thank You that during
times of uncertainty Your loving hands
guide us and equip us that we might
know what to do.
In the midst of orchestrating the de-
tails of the universe, we thank You for
valuing our individual lives. You are
not too busy for us.
Your word says, ‘‘You are the God
who sees me.’’ What a joy it is to know
that. You not only know us, but You
know just what we should do to better
ourselves and to better our world.
Speak to us today and give us the
courage to trust You. Shine Your light
in dark places that the truth might be
visible and let hearts that know You be
mindful of You today.
I pray all this in the mighty name of
Jesus.
Amen.

RECOGNIZING THE 125TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF LOWELL OBSERVATORY
HON. TOM O’HALLERAN
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, on May
28, 1894 Percival Lowell arrived in Flagstaff,
Arizona Territory and officially began oper-
ations at his new astronomical observatory.
This was one of the first permanent scientific
establishments in the western United States
and one of the most storied centers for sci-
entific research and outreach in the world. As
we celebrate Lowell Observatory’s 125th anni-
versary this year, we not only look back to
honor its rich heritage, but also look ahead to
a future in which the sky is not the limit but
the starting point.
Percival Lowell was the scion of a Boston
Brahmin clan steeped in the traditions of pub-
lic service and community leadership. His sib-
lings alone included brother Abbott Lawrence,
president of Harvard University for 24 years,
and Pulitzer-Prize-winning poet Amy. Percival
Lowell established his observatory initially to
study Mars and the possibility of intelligent life
there. He transcended science into pop culture
by writing several popular books and lecturing
widely. His provocative ideas triggered much
discussion and debate—both within and out-
side of scientific circles—about extraterrestrial
life. This standard set by Lowell to not only
carry out research but to share the wonder
and awe of space with the public led to the
observatory’s dual mission of research and
education.
Some significant contributions made at Low-
ell Observatory:
V.M. Slipher detected the first evidence of
the expanding universe in 1912.
Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto in 1930.
At the urging of Lowell scientists, Flagstaff
enacted the world’s first dark skies ordinance
in 1958. This laid the path for future regula-
tions that culminated in the community’s des-
ignation as the first International Dark Sky
City, in 2001.
Flagstaff continues to serve as a model for
dark skies protection.
The second class of astronauts, the so-
called ‘‘Next Nine’’ that included Neil Arm-
strong, and Jim Lovell, visited Lowell Observ-
atory in 1963 to learn about the lunar mapping
efforts going on here. This was part of a train-
ing exercise in northern Arizona that proved
an important step in preparing the astronauts
for their missions to the Moon.
A team of scientists, including many from
Lowell, discovered the rings of Uranus in
1977.
Using observations with several research in-
struments, including Lowell Observatory’s Per-
kins Telescope, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford
confirmed the existence of dark; matter in
1978.
A team of scientists, including many from
Lowell, discovered Pluto’s atmosphere in
1988.
Lowell scientist Will Grundy served as a
team leader on the New Horizons mission’s
2015 exploration of Pluto. This mission re-
turned stunning images of the only planet in
our solar system discovered in the United
States.
Today, scientists at Lowell use a variety of
ground-and space-based instruments for re-
search—including Lowell Observatory’s flag-
ship Discovery Channel Telescope, one of the
most versatile telescopes in the world. Mean-
while, the visitor program welcomes more than
100,000 guests per year and in the fall will
complete construction of the Giovale Open
Deck Observatory, the first stage of a multi-
year master plan that will greatly increase the
observatory’s educational reach.
In recognition of Lowell’s heritage of
science, education, culture, and history, the
observatory was designated a Registered Na-
tional Historic Landmark by the National Park
Service in 1965 and identified as an Arizona
Treasure in 2005 by Governor Janet Napoli-
tano. In 2011 Time magazine named it one of
‘‘The World’s 100 Most Important Places.’’
Also, Astronomy magazine Editor Dave Eicher
recently nicknamed Lowell Observatory
‘‘America’s Observatory’’ because of its
‘‘unique combination of astronomical history
and famous discoveries’’.

AMERICAN DREAM AND PROMISE
ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. HENRY CUELLAR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I include in the
RECORD the following letter in support of H.R.
6, The American Dream and Promise Act of
2019.
ASSOCIATION OF JESUIT
COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (AJCU),
May 31, 2019.
Hon. HENRY CUELLAR,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE CUELLAR: I write to
you, an alum of one of our nation’s Jesuit
colleges and universities, in support of H.R.
6, the Dream and Promise Act of 2019, as it
was amended by the House Judiciary Com-
mittee earlier this month. This is important
legislation that clearly reflects the values of
Jesuit institutions across the country.
The Association of Jesuit Colleges and
Universities (AJCU) stated in 2016:
‘‘Grounded in our Catholic and Jesuit mis-
sion, we are guided by our commitment to
uphold the dignity of every person, to work
for the common good of our nation, and to
promote a living faith that works for justice.
We see our work of teaching, scholarship and
the formation of minds and spirits as a sa-
cred trust.
That calls us to labor for solidarity among
all people, and especially with and for the
poor and marginalized in our society. That
trust calls us to embrace the entire human
family, regardless of their immigration sta-
tus or religious allegiance. And experience
has shown us that our communities are im-
measurably enriched by the presence, intel-
ligence and contributions of undocumented
students, as well as of faculty and staff of
every color and from every faith tradition.’’
That statement went on to reaffirm our
commitment to the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Like-
wise, its principles lead us to strongly sup-
port passage of H.R. 6, which would finally
provide lawful permanent resident status,
and a pathway toward citizenship for the
Dreamers who are very much a part of Jesuit
campus communities across the nation. The
presence of those young people on our cam-
puses has enabled us to come to know and
admire them. They have long considered the
United States their home and, in fact, many
of them have hardly any recollections of the
countries where they were born. These indi-
viduals are pursuing or have successfully
completed at least two years of higher edu-
cation, served in our military or been stead-
ily employed.
Simply put, we cannot imagine not want-
ing these individuals to remain a part of our
country. Under provisions of H.R. 6, those
who qualify for the program cannot have
committed a felony or other serious crimes
and can pose no threat to national security
or public safety. These individuals are con-
tributing to our society and our economy.
They work and pay taxes. Indeed, they have
lived their lives as Americans, but with the
exception of having the legal status that
they well deserve. For too long, they have
had to live with uncertainty. With your help,
by voting for H.R. 6, Congress will have
taken a major step to remedy that situation.
Sincerely,
MICHAEL J. SHEERAN, S.J.,
President, Association of Jesuit
Colleges and Universities.

TARY SERVICE OF WORLD WAR
II VETERAN, JOSEPH LEON MER-
RITT
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the life and military
service of World War II Veteran Joseph Leon
Merritt. Mr. Merritt has always placed God and
family first in his life, offering friendship and
brotherly love to all those who crossed his
path.
Mr. Merritt was born on May 27, 1919, in
Sturgis, Mississippi. He spent his early life in
ltawamba County with his parents, Frank and
Lula Lee Merritt, and his seven siblings. After
the war, Mr. Merritt moved to Louisville, Mis-
sissippi where he still resides to this day.
From 1942 to 1946, Mr. Merritt answered
the call to serve our great nation in the U.S.
Marines. Serving as a driver and bulldozer op-
erator, Mr. Merritt rose to the rank of Corporal
and was recognized for participating in actions

against the enemy in Tarawa, Saipan, and
Tinian. Mr. Merritt founded Merritt Plumbing
Company in Louisville and worked there until
his retirement in 1983.
In 1945, Mr. Merritt married Gladys Taylor,
and they remained together for almost 70
years. Upon Mr. Merritt’s return from military
service, the family grew to include two chil-
dren, Joe Merritt and Carol Higginbotham. Mr.
Merritt now has six grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.
Throughout his life and to this day, Mr. Mer-
ritt set an example for his children to follow.
Mr. Merritt, a lifelong Christian, was an active
member of Poplar Flat Baptist Church, where
he served as Music Director for 50 years and
was chosen to be a deacon of the church.
On Memorial Day of 2019, Mr. Merritt cele-
brated his 100th birthday. Mr. Merritt is an
American patriot who served our great nation
and continues to set an example for others to
follow. We wish him many more years of good
health.

RECOGNIZING MS. YNETTE LOPEZ
OF PIPER HIGH SCHOOL CLASS
OF 2020
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Ms. Ynette Lopez, a student at
Piper High School and Class of 2020 in Sun-
rise, Florida. This remarkable young lady has
a current weighted GPA of 3.4, while taking a
rigorous schedule of all Honors classes. Addi-
tionally, she is passionate about her extra-
curricular activities, hobbies, and volunteer
work. She is a six-year professional clarinetist
and currently occupies the 1st chair position
with the Bengal Band of Pride.
Ynette has volunteered at the Department of
Veterans Affairs since 2017. Her father is a
disabled veteran with post-traumatic stress
disorder. Growing up and learning so much
about his disability, she was inspired to give
back in the best way possible. She has ac-
crued more than 200 hours of volunteer work
in her many different capacities. Ynette has
gained valuable experience by scheduling ap-
pointments, communicating with others, and
delivering important documents to various of-
fices at the Broward County Veterans Hos-
pital.
She is currently preparing to take the next
step in her future and will apply early admis-
sion in November of this year. Ynette plans to
attend Florida Agricultural and Mechanical
University in Tallahassee, where she will study
Sociology with a Psychology minor. Ynette’s
persistence, dedication, and ambition has car-
ried her far and I wish her much success in
the future.

IN HONOR OF MASTER SERGEANT
ELVIN TRUSTY, III FOR HIS EX-
EMPLARY SERVICE
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Master Sergeant Elvin
Trusty, III for his dedicated service. His com-
mitment to country and community is worthy of
commendation.
Born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland,
MSG Elvin Trusty attended Dunbar Sr. High
School prior to completing Basic Combat and
Advanced Individual Training at Fort Sill in
Oklahoma. He became the Battalion Oper-
ations Sergeant on the Wolf Team at the Na-
tional Training Center at Fort Irwin and later
assumed duties as Operations Group First
Sergeant. MSG Trusty completed two full
tours and one extended tour in Iraq and a tour
in Afghanistan, earning numerous medals and
awards for his service. MSG Trusty currently
attends the University of Louisville pursuing a
Bachelor of Science in Organizational Leader-
ship and Learning. He is also a military
science instructor and assistant chair of the
Army Officer Education Program at the Univer-
sity of Michigan.
MSG Trusty has shown a tremendous love
for his country and community. His years as
an educator and a member of the United
States Military exemplify the selflessness of
public service and stand as a testament to
duty, honor, and country. We thank Master
Sergeant Elvin Trusty, III for his commitment
to protecting the American people and we
congratulate him on his retirement. His dedi-
cated leadership will be missed, but we wish
him good health and every happiness in his
retirement years.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Master Sergeant Elvin Trusty,
III for his exemplary service. He has effectively
served Michigan and its residents through his
selflessness and leadership.

HONORING GUNNERY SERGEANT
HENRY L. BAUL, FOUNDER OF
MONTFORD POINT MARINES OF
AMERICA, INC.
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, it is with great
honor that I recognize Gunnery Sergeant
Henry L. Baul, the 5th African-American Ma-
rine in the nation to be inducted into the U.S.
Marine Corps in 1942 following President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Executive Order
8802, which ended discrimination in the armed
forces.
Although the executive order may have in-
tended to end all discrimination, it did not end
segregation. Between 1942 and 1949, ap-
proximately twenty thousand Black Marines
trained at a segregated facility named Camp
Montford Point, New River, Marine Corps
Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The
Montford Marine Corp is derived from the
name of the facility and Mr. Baul trained there.
In 2011, President Barack Obama and the
112th U.S. Congress passed legislation to
award the Congressional Gold Medal to the
Montford Marine Corp at a special ceremony
at the U.S. Capitol and Marine Corps Barracks
here in D.C.
Mr. Baul, age ninety-six, is a resident of the
city of Detroit. He is also Founder and Presi-
dent-Emeritus of the Montford Point Marines
of America, Inc. non-profit.
I am proud to recognize Mr. Baul for his
work and service. Mr. Baul and so many oth-
ers decided to serve this country even in the
face of adversity and discrimination right here
at home. Today, I lift up the veterans across
the 13th Congressional District and the great
state of Michigan in recognition of their service
and commitment.

AMERICAN DREAM AND PROMISE
ACT (H.R. 6)
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate alongside the hundreds of thou-
sands of DACA recipients and TPS holders on
the historic passage of the American Dream
and Promise Act. I was proud to join my
House colleagues this week in passing H.R.
6—and thereby marking a critical milestone in
the long fight to protect those who have
known only this country as their home.
For too long, DACA recipients have been
left wondering and waiting, not knowing what
will happen with their immigration status. It is
time we end that. TPS recipients remain living
year-by-year—wondering if their TPS status
will be extended. It is time we end that.
Dreamers and TPS recipients are our neigh-
bors and friends; they contribute to our com-
munities, pay taxes, fight for our country and
our freedoms, and live and work toward the
American dream.
The Trump Administration’s approach to im-
migration has been cruel, unjust, and vicious.
Its decision to dismantle the DACA program
and terminate TPS designations for several
countries is inhumane and an abandonment of
American values and principles. Instead of
working toward a future that creates hope and
opportunity for Dreamers, and TPS and DED
recipients, the Administration has relentlessly
sought to further drive them into the shadows
and close the door on their dreams and aspi-
rations.
DACA has enabled 800,000 Dreamers who
came to the United States as children, through
no decision of their own, to get an education,
to get jobs, and to meaningfully contribute to
the economy of the only country they have
ever called home. They have shown incredible
potential and achievement. For instance, Jin
Park, one of my constituents from Queens,
NY, is the first DACA recipient to be awarded
the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship, and he
will begin his studies this fall at the University
of Oxford in England. Instead of having the
usual worries of living and studying abroad,
Jin fears he may not be allowed to return to
the United States. We need the American
Dream and Promise Act for Jin.
Furthermore, with respect to TPS, I think
about my constituents, the Nepali community
of Queens, who were deeply impacted by the
April 2015 massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake
that devastated Nepal and destroyed over half
a million homes. Today, we have 400,000 for-
eign nationals living in the U.S. with TPS,
some of whom have lived in the U.S. for dec-
ades. And I am proud to have fought in Con-
gress for Nepal’s TPS designation and exten-
sion. TPS is not a decision that is made light-
ly, but it is a decision that is made compas-
sionately. We need the American Dream and
Promise Act for the Nepali community, and all
the other TPS recipients.

gress to protect these individuals who, for too
long, have lived in limbo and in the shadows.
I am proud to have voted in for the American
Dream and Promise Act which would provide
vital and humane protections for Dreamers,
TPS, and DED recipients. After all, they are
integral members of our community, they each
have an American story, and they are deeply
woven into the fabric of this nation.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MRS.
NANNIE E. WILKINS
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to celebrate the life of Mrs. Nannie E. Wil-
kins, a matriarch of CA–24’s NAACP Chapter.
Mrs. Wilkins was described as ‘‘a social justice
and human and civil rights champion,’’ be-
cause of her hard work fighting for equal rights
in the Central Coast.
Nannie Elizabeth Browning was born in
Mebane, North Carolina on March 13, 1927 to
John Henry Browning and Annie Pearl Rich-
mond. As a young woman, she studied at
North Carolina AT&T and earned a bachelor’s
degree in Business Administration and Com-
mercial Education—an extraordinary accom-
plishment for women of color at the time. In
1951, Nannie E. Browning married Smiley Ed-
ward Wilkins, a member of the U.S. Air Force.
Nannie was an ambitious go-getter; she en-
couraged Smiley to become an officer and
used her education and fiscal know-how to
raise and run the family.
In 1972, after Smiley retired from the mili-
tary, the Wilkins family moved to Lompoc,
where Nannie continued her life in community
and public service. She selflessly served as a
hospice volunteer and on the Executive Com-
mittee of the Santa Maria-Lompoc Branch of
the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP) for more than
forty-three years.
Alongside her husband, former President of
the NAACP, she tackled race-based discrimi-
nation in their community. She was a Silver
Life and Golden Heritage member of the
NAACP, serving as the Communication, Press
& Publicity Chair. Among her valiant strides to-
wards justice, she also served as a Diaconate
at the Valley of the Flowers United Church of
Christ for thirty years and was a dedicated
member of Lompoc Alpha Club for twenty-five
years.
Nannie passed away on May 9, 2019 at her
home in Lompoc, California at the age of nine-
ty-two. Her soul and legacy as a Civil Rights
champion lives on in her loving family, her
friends, and every community member liber-
ated and inspired by her courageous efforts.
Madam Speaker, I am honored to join the
nation and the Wilkins Family in celebrating
the special life of Nannie Elizabeth Wilkins.
CELEBRATING THE 100TH
BIRTHDAY OF MR. SID STAFFORD
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize World War II veteran Sid Stafford, in
celebration of his 100th birthday and for his
service to the United States of America.
Mr. Stafford was born and raised in South
Texas before joining the U.S. Army in 1941.
His military service took him across the world
to serve his country in the European Cam-
paign during World War II. Mr. Stafford was in
a tank platoon where he worked as a me-
chanic. Across much of North Africa and Eu-
rope, he courageously fought for the safety of
Americans and people around the globe
against the Nazi regime.
After being honorably discharged from the
military in September of 1945, Mr. Stafford
settled down on his farm in Hallsville, Texas,
where he met his wife, Mrs. Nitalene Waldron.
Together, they raised two beautiful daughters
in East Texas. Mrs. Stafford passed away on
March 15th of this year, and they would have
celebrated their 68th anniversary yesterday,
June 4th. Throughout his life, Mr. Stafford has
made a positive impact on his East Texas
community and it is an honor to call him my
friend. No matter what life has in store for him,
he has always made one thing clear: the im-
portance of trusting in the Lord with all of your
heart.
Madam Speaker, it is because of the sac-
rifices made by men and women like Mr. Sid
Stafford that we are able to enjoy the free-
doms which we all hold so dear. Let us not
forget this great generation. We thank Mr.
Stafford for the contribution he has made in
preserving our liberty and we wish him a very
happy 100th birthday.

CELEBRATING THE BICENTENNIAL
OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE
HOUSE
HON. ANN M. KUSTER
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 200th
birthday of the New Hampshire State House,
also known as the ‘‘People’s House.’’
Standing in beautiful downtown Concord,
the State House was designed in 1814 by ar-
chitect Stuart Park and opened on June 2,
1819. It is the oldest state capitol in which
both houses of the legislature meet in their
original chambers and is home to the largest
legislative body in our nation, with 400 mem-
bers. As the first significant granite building in
New Hampshire, the State House was a sym-
bol of the growing granite industry in Concord
and our state.
While additions and updates have been
made over the years to accommodate govern-
ment entities such as the General Court, the
Secretary of State, and the State Treasurer,
the State House remains a focal point in Con-
cord and a source of pride for New Hampshire
two centuries after opening.
On behalf of my constituents across New
Hampshire’s Second Congressional District, I
thank the State House Bicentennial Commis-
sion for organizing this 200th birthday celebra-
tion and I send my deepest appreciation to ev-
eryone who maintains this historic, beautiful
building.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF DR. ISAAC JOSEPH
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND
OF LOUISIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the life and legacy of Dr. Isaac Joseph,
a veteran educator and the first African-Amer-
ican superintendent of the Jefferson Parish
Public School System. Dr. Joseph passed
away on Monday, June 3, 2019 at the age of
64.
Dr. Joseph was a graduate of Southern Uni-
versity at Baton Rouge, where he earned a
B.S. degree in Health and Physical Education
and a Master of Education in Guidance and
Counseling. He completed all coursework to-
wards a doctoral degree in educational leader-
ship from the University of New Orleans.
Dr. Joseph led Louisiana’s largest school
district from 2015 to 2018. In 2018, Dr. Joseph
resigned as the leader of Jefferson schools.
In 1986 Dr. Joseph began his career in edu-
cation as a teacher in Jefferson Parish.
Throughout his career he served in a variety
of roles including principal, assistant super-
intendent of human resources, and executive
director of grants and federal programs.
In 1987 and 1989, Dr. Joseph was be-
stowed the Waggaman School Teacher of the
Year award. Less than a decade later, Dr. Jo-
seph was named Educator of the Year by the
National Council on Educating Black Children.
Dr. Joseph loved the city and the people of
New Orleans. His legacy will forever be a part
of the city and his dedication to community
embodies the spirit of New Orleans. We can-
not match the sacrifices made by Dr. Joseph,
but surely, we can try to match his sense of
service. We cannot match his courage, but we
can strive to match his devotion.
Dr. Joseph is survived by a wife, Faith. The
couple had a son and Dr. Joseph had two
other sons and daughters.
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and
legacy of Dr. Isaac Joseph.

IN HONOR OF KAREN HANRAHAN

OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Ms. Hanrahan, the retiring Head of
School at Mercy High School Burlingame. Ms.
Hanrahan has been a strong leader of this
school for the past six years and is beloved on
campus. I deeply admire her and feel privi-
leged to call her a great friend.
During her time at Mercy, the school has
benefitted greatly through her leadership.

tremendous role model. When she arrived, the
school’s enrollment was declining. She re-
versed the trend. Her interactions with stu-
dents are a joy to observe. Smiles break out,
sometimes hugs ensue, but students also
know that she has high standards. Ms.
Hanrahan stresses the belief of the Sisters of
Mercy that every student is capable of improv-
ing herself and that every student should give
back to the community. She imbues the value
of social justice in the students through hands-
on experiences. For example, a few years ago
several Mercy girls joined me and a group of
Rosie the Riveters at a rally to ratify the Equal
Rights Amendment.
While at Mercy, the budget has been placed
on sound footing. She’s now raising funds for
a $12 million gymnasium and activities center,
the first building on campus where all students
will be able to assemble at once. In just eight
months, $2.3 million has been pledged. She
once calmly explained to my staff that it would
certainly require work to raise $12 million but
that it was doable, and then briefly explained
the nuts and bolts of raising this extraordinary
sum. She is demonstrating great leadership
even now as she has been working over many
months to train her replacement. It is apparent
that the transition will go smoothly.
She emphasized to parents that science
and technology play a big role in Mercy’s cur-
riculum, while also stressing the importance of
a broad education. Mercy offers 37 AP
courses ranging from biology to calculus to
history and even studio art in 3D. There are
18 honors courses in sciences and the hu-
manities. Ms. Hanrahan works with depart-
ment heads to ensure that Mercy’s curriculum
offers a breadth of study that allows each stu-
dent to reach her fullest potential. As an en-
thusiastic sports fan, she celebrates when
Mercy’s teams excel, as they often do. As the
Head of School, Ms. Hanrahan is remarkably
down to earth and models for the students
that no one should take him or herself too se-
riously. During Mercy week, she dyed a streak
of her hair royal blue, one of the school colors.
Karen Hanrahan began her career as the
Director of Development at yet another Catho-
lic school for girls, Cornelia Connelly School in
Anaheim, California. As she would in several
other later positions, Ms. Hanrahan raised
funds to bring facilities up to date and to close
budget deficits. For example, at Bishop
Hendricken High School in Warwick, Rhode
Island, she supervised admissions and alum-
nae, and was responsible for the annual fund
and handled all communications. She then
moved on to numerous other accomplish-
ments in Catholic schools, and at one private
school, throughout the country.
However, it was in Baltimore that she met
her pre-Mercy community and education chal-
lenges that would prepare her for her years at
Mercy. In Baltimore, she became the Execu-
tive Director of the Baltimore City Police Me-
morial Fund. She spent two years raising
funds to ensure that fallen officers would
never be forgotten. She then became the
President and CEO of two Catholic schools,
one a co-ed pre-K to 8th and the other an all-
girls high school.
At Seton Keough High School and Holy An-
gels Catholic School, Ms. Hanrahan was the
Energizer Bunny who did it all. She was in-
volved in marketing, communications, and
fundraising. She supervised all finances, de-
veloped budgets and strategic plans, and was
the face of the school in the community. She
reduced the deficit of the two schools by 50
percent and reinvigorated the curriculum. She
did everything imaginable to give the students
of these two schools an outstanding edu-
cation.
As Ms. Hanrahan came onboard from Balti-
more, she knew that Mercy Burlingame also
needed help. Ever the optimist, she dove right
in, and she delivered through extraordinary
self-discipline and an engaging personal style.
Today, the banner on the school’s website
says, ‘‘Be known. Be Challenged. Be Trans-
formed.’’ This could describe Ms. Hanrahan.
She’s known, been challenged, and has trans-
formed the school into a stronger and better
Mercy. She deserves a rest, but it would be
unwise to call it a retirement because leaders
like Ms. Hanrahan neither retire nor fade
away. They listen closely to the next great
calling, and then patiently re-engage in the ex-
citing enterprise of creating a better tomorrow.
We all await the day when we learn that Ms.
Hanrahan has again set her sights upon a
goal because it will likely be in service to a
cause that enriches both us and our nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF PETER J.
MURDOCK’S LIFE AND LEGACY
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Peter J. Murdock’s lifetime
of service. Mr. Murdock passed away on May
4, 2019 which greatly saddened our commu-
nity. His lifetime of service to the Ypsilanti
community is worthy of commendation.
Mr. Murdock was a fixture of the Ypsilanti
community. He moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan
from his hometown of Boston, Massachusetts
in the 1960s. Immediately after arriving, he be-
came involved with the Ypsilanti Tenants’
Union. He was employed at Motor Wheel and
the Ford Rawsonville plant and was a key
member of the local UAW chapter. For the re-
mainder of his career, Mr. Murdock worked
with the Ypsilanti Recycling Project and Recy-
cle Ann Arbor. Mr. Murdock was elected to the
Ypsilanti City Council from 1978 to 1982 and
became the Mayor of the City of Ypsilanti in
1982 where he served for three consecutive
terms. After his tenure as Mayor, he returned
to the Ypsilanti City Council from 1991 until
1993, and from 2008 until his passing. During
that time, he attended Eastern Michigan Uni-
versity and graduated with a Bachelor’s de-
gree in Political Science in 1996.
Mr. Murdock and his wife Grace Sweeney
were dedicated to historical preservation,
founding the Ypsilanti East Side Neighborhood
Association and supporting the revitalization of
Depot Town. He was a champion for the envi-
ronment, supporting solar power, crafting
plans for city-wide recycling, invigorating com-
munity parks, and promoting sustainability.
During his over 25–year tenure in Ypsilanti
government he implemented policies that have
positively affected the lives of all Ypsilanti resi-
dents.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the legacy of Peter J. Murdock
and his lifetime of service. We are truly grate-
ful for his numerous contributions to the Ypsi-
lanti community and to the County of
Washtenaw. He will be dearly missed.

HONORING NADINE WHITTED, RE-

BUSHWICK 14TH ANNUAL PA-
RADE
HON. NYDIA M. VELÁZQUEZ
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Nadine Whitted, life-time
resident of the Bushwick community and
former Brooklyn Community Board 4 District
Manager. Ms. Whitted retired in 2016 but her
leadership and advocacy efforts continue
today. She is considered a model civil servant
by her community and colleagues in govern-
ment. Her career spans an impressive 30
years of public service.
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Nadine is the
second child born to Rose Rucker and Emer-
son Whitted. According to her family, Nadine
exemplified leadership qualities and an inter-
est for public service at a young age. In 1977
during the New York City fiscal crisis, Ms.
Whitted was hired as an Administrative Aide
for Community Board 4 approximately three
days prior to the Black Out of July 1977. This
event detrimentally impacted the quality of life,
infrastructure and Bushwick’s economic devel-
opment for decades. Ms. Whitted was deter-
mined to be part of her neighborhood’s revital-
ization.
Within two years she was promoted to the
position of Assistant District Manager, under
this new role she strengthened her skills and
diligently fostered relationships with city agen-
cies, elected officials and stakeholders to help
craft a community led revitalization project.
The neighborhood’s distinction as the poorest
community district in the city fueled Ms.
Whitted. Her efforts resulted in her promotion
to District Manager in 1986. From 1986 to
2016 she served as District Manager with dis-
tinction. Her effective management skills and
leadership were instrumental in the success of
major projects ranging from the delivery of es-
sential services, street lighting along commer-
cial corridors and the development of large
scale affordable housing and open space.
Nadine Whitted remains a champion of the
Bushwick, Brooklyn community. I thank her for
dedication and decades of public service. It is
my honor to recognize her on this special oc-
casion of the Shape Up Bushwick 14th Annual
Parade.

June 6, 2019
Mr. Gonzales was born and raised in the
small town of Santa Paula, CA. For a few
years, he and his wife lived in Santa Barbara
before permanently moving to Lompoc in
1984, where he dedicated thirty-three years of
his life to helping youth and preaching the
word of God.
While in Lompoc, Mr. Gonzales had a rep-
utation for his ability to mentor troubled and
at-risk youth, earning the nickname of
Lompoc’s ‘‘Kid Whisperer.’’ Most of his work in
Lompoc was carried out at the church he
founded, Cornerstone Church, and at the Boys
& Girls Club. During the thirteen years that Mr.
Gonzales directed and oversaw Lompoc’s
Boys & Girls Club teen program, he expanded
it from a small group of 25 kids to around 400
strong.
As a result of his work, Mr. Gonzales had
received numerous accolades during his life.
One of those being the renaming of the teen
center at the Boys & Girls Club to the ‘‘The
Conrad Gonzales Teen Center.’’ Other honors
included being the first recipient of the Valley
of Flowers Peace Prize Award as well as
being the recipient of a Distinguished Service
Award from the Kiwanis Club of Lompoc.
Mr. Gonzales passed away on December
27, 2018, after a bout with Lou Gehrig’s dis-
ease, but his soul lives on in his loving family,
his friends, and every troubled and at-risk teen
he aided and inspired along the way.

the nation and the Gonzales Family in cele-
brating the special life of Conrad Gonzales.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHAIRMAN H.
CARL MCCALL ON HIS RETIRE-
MENT FROM THE STATE UNI-
VERSITY OF NEW YORK’S BOARD
OF TRUSTEES AND CELEBRA-
TION OF HIS FIFTY YEARS OF
PUBLIC SERVICE
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, for more
than five decades, H. Carl McCall has always
been a steward for public good and will go
down in New York’s history as a monument to
public service.
Before he turned thirty, McCall worked as a
school teacher, served in the U.S. Army, and
opened a church. This is a testament to his
character and unbridled work-ethic. Born in
the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massa-
chusetts, McCall eventually made New York
City his home, where his indelible impact is
seen to this day.
Spanning multiple administrations, McCall
has been elevated to positions of greater and
greater import. It is not lost on New Yorkers or
observers of his body of work that he has
risen to meet many daunting challenges and
emerged successful. During his career in pub-
lic service, McCall has served as New York
State Senator, a delegate to the United Na-
tions, Commissioner of the New York Division
of Human Rights, President of the New York
City Board of Education, and Commissioner of
the Port Authority of New York and New Jer-
sey. With his long list of roles and accolades,
we cannot speak of H. Carl McCall without
recognizing his groundbreaking achievement
as the first African American to hold statewide
office in New York State as Comptroller serv-
ing from 1993 to 2002.
But for all his accomplishments, we all know
that public education has always been a pas-
sion and priority since McCall was a teacher
himself. As president of the New York City
Board of Education under Mayor David
Dinkins from 1991 to 1992, his vision guided
policy for one of the largest public-school sys-
tems in the U.S.
It was always his belief that public education
was the incubator for personal growth and
scholastic enrichment. This was exemplified in
his leadership as the chairman of the Public
Higher Education Conference Board and later
member and chairman of the State University
of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees. He
has served on the board since 2011 and has
presided over a significant expansion of
SUNY’s academic curriculum and the diver-
sification of its administration, faculty and stu-
dent body.
Over his long and distinguished career,
McCall has been awarded nine honorary de-
grees, in addition to his own degrees from
Dartmouth College, the University of Edin-
burgh and Master of Divinity from Andover
Newton Theological School. He has also re-
ceived the Nelson Rockefeller Distinguished
Public Service Award from the University of
Albany.
On behalf of the New York Congressional
Delegation in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives in the 116th Congress, we want to con-
gratulate H. Carl McCall on his retirement after
ten years of service with the State University
of New York Board of Trustees and thank him
for his half-century of public service to New
York and our nation.

RECOGNIZING THE TALENT OF
LACI KAYE BOOTH
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Laci Kaye Booth of Livingston,
Texas. She is a musician with an incredible
God-given talent, which she has so graciously
shared with her community, state, and coun-
try.
Laci Kaye Booth was born in Livingston,
Texas on August 28, 1995. Surrounded by
sixty acres of land, Laci grew up playing in the
woods and creeks of East Texas. Music was
a big part of her life from the beginning,
whether it was singing at home or church. In-
spired by her upbringing she began singing at
the age of three and learned to play the guitar
at the age of eight. She has become a tal-
ented musician and song writer who finds joy
in sharing her talents with others.
Booth attended Sam Houston State Univer-
sity in pursuit of a degree in healthcare. While
in college, she used her musical talent to help
with expenses. Earlier this year, Laci was se-
lected as a candidate on the competitive tele-
vision show, American Idol, where she se-
cured a spot in the top five. She sang herself
into the hearts of many Americans. It has
been said by hit vocal artists that she has a
beautiful, ‘‘unique timbre voice,’’ and is a ‘‘dia-
mond in the rough.’’ Livingston and the entire
36th Congressional District are proud of Laci’s
accomplishments and are looking forward to
supporting her musical pursuits in the future.
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to
recognize Laci Kaye Booth. May God continue
to bless Laci and the voice He has given her,
so that she may continue to share it with
America and the world.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E724 June 6, 2019
Day and honor Staff Sergeant Arnold Ray-
mond ‘‘Ray’’ Lambert, a World War II veteran
and Moore County constituent.
There are American heroes, and then there
are American giants. Ray—along with other
men and women of the Greatest Generation—
is a giant. At 98-years-old, he is one of the
few surviving warriors who stormed the beach-
es of Normandy on June 6, 1944.
Seventy-five years ago, 160,000 Allied
troops landed along a heavily fortified French
coastline and established a foot-hold in Nazi-
occupied France—though that one sentence
hardly does the invasion any justice. D-Day
was a major turning point in WWII and the be-
ginning of the end for Nazi Germany.
Ray served as a medic in the 16th Infantry
Regiment of the army’s storied First Division,
the ‘‘Big Red One.’’ Facing intense fire from
German forces, his medical unit landed with
the first assault wave at Omaha Beach. Sol-
diers were killed and wounded all around him,
and Ray pressed on—rescuing troops from
drowning, attending to countless wounds,
hauling soldiers to safety, and always serving
his fellow men in uniform. He was wounded
and in immense pain himself, but he per-
severed after giving himself a shot of mor-
phine. That’s incredible and selfless service at
its finest.
Ray sacrificed on that beach. He saved
countless men on that beach. And he never
once gave up. After breaking his back and los-
ing consciousness, he was picked up and
evacuated by a landing craft. On that same
landing craft was another heroic medic who
was wounded—his brother, Bill. They were
taken to safety in England and began the long
journey back home and to recovery.
Before Normandy, Ray served in North Afri-
ca with the Big Red One and earned his first
Silver Star for rescuing wounded soldiers
under fire in 1943. He continued to risk his life
to save his fellow men in uniform, next in Sic-
ily. A Purple Heart, Bronze Star and Silver
Star recipient, Ray continues to serve our
country and our community and he recently
published a memoir titled ‘‘Every Man a Hero.’’
I admire Ray not only for his service, but
also for his desire to memorialize his fallen
comrades and his efforts to pass on the great
values of his generation. As he said recently,
‘‘Perhaps they should teach a little more in
schools about World War II and how the gen-
eration at that time, my generation, loved the
country and respected the flag and was willing
to fight for our families and our country.’’ I
agree and believe every generation owes an
enormous debt to Ray and the Greatest Gen-
eration.
I applaud Ray for his tremendous service,
and I thank him for his courageous and self-
less actions. I am so proud to represent him
in Congress, and I wish him and his wife Bar-
bara and their family all the best.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
honoring Staff Sergeant Ray Lambert and his
service to our country.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF TOM
JOYNER ON HIS RETIREMENT
HON. ANDRÉ CARSON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to honor and recognize Tom
Joyner, of the Tom Joyner Morning Show,
who is an iconic DJ and radio legend, and
plans on retiring at the end of this year.
Tom has entertained and inspired millions of
people throughout his career. He is a brilliant
individual and a hard worker, earning the nick-
name ‘‘The Fly Jock’’ by flying between a
morning show in Dallas, Texas and an after-
noon show in Chicago, Illinois earlier in his ca-
reer. In 1994, The Tom Joyner Morning Show
was syndicated, and it has aired on the WTLC
airwaves in the Indianapolis community for
more than 25 years. Tom is also the founder
of The Tom Joyner Foundation, Reach Media
Inc., and BlackAmericaWeb.com. His tireless
work and influence was honored in 1998 when
he was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame.
Tom grew up in Alabama, and his father
served as a Tuskegee Airman. True to these
roots, he has a deep commitment to civil
rights, and has used his platform to serve oth-
ers. He has raised millions of dollars through
the Tom Joyner Foundation to provide schol-
arships, endowments, and capacity building
enhancements for Historically Black Colleges
and Universities and their students. Tom has
also been a champion for voting rights. He
has tirelessly promoted voter engagement—in-
spiring listeners not only to register to vote but
to be better informed about the issues and the
candidates. His efforts are credited for helping
to turn out a record number of voters in the
African American community during the his-
toric 2008 election.
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in
wishing Tom Joyner a happy retirement. His
work has informed and inspired countless indi-
viduals in our community, and he leaves a leg-
acy of service to be followed for all Americans.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SERVICE,
DEDICATION, AND SACRIFICE OF
SERGEANT CHEEXENG LEE
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to welcome home Sergeant Cheexeng
Lee from his service in the United States Ma-
rine Corps.
Sgt Lee enlisted into the Marine Corps in
May 2009. Upon graduating from Appleton
West High School in June 2010, he went to
boot camp at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San
Diego. Pvt Lee was stationed at Camp Pen-
dleton north of San Diego, and after additional
training, checked into his first unit, 3rd Bat-
talion 1st Marines. He was reassigned from
his original role as Rifleman to Machine Gun-
ner under Weapons Platoon, India Company
3/1. He later deployed with the 11th Marine
Expeditionary Unit from November 2011 to
June 2012.
While on the MEU, Lance Corporal Lee
served in Malaysia, Singapore, Djibouti, Bah-
rain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan, and Hong
Kong. After this deployment, he attended Ad-
vanced Machine Gunners Course and was se-
lected to join 3/1’s elite Scout Sniper Platoon.
From October 2013 to April 2014, he deployed
to Okinawa, Japan. He was then stationed in
Thailand to participate in Operation Cobra
Gold, a major multinational military exercise.
After completing his second deployment,
Corporal Lee attended Scout Sniper Course
(SSC), completing the grueling course in April
2015. Afterwards, he deployed with the 15th
MEU from May 2015 to December 2015,
where he served in Hong Kong, Bahrain,
Dubai, and Kuwait.
After his third deployment, he was trans-
ferred to Division School Pre-Scout Sniper
Course at Camp Pendleton from March 2016
to June 2018. During that time, he trained
hundreds of Marines from various units to bet-
ter prepare them for SSC. Sgt Lee also
trained Japanese Snipers from the Japanese
Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF). He trav-
elled to Washington, D.C. to provide subject
matter expertise as the Marine Corps tested a
new sniper rifle, a model that is now currently
in use by Marine Snipers deployed around the
world.
Words cannot adequately thank Sgt Lee for
his years of service to our country. May his
service, dedication, and sacrifice be remem-
bered by a grateful nation. It is truly an honor
to welcome him home.

IN RECOGNITION OF DAVID ‘‘GINO’’
GASPARINI
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Gino Gasparini of Redwood City upon
his retirement after 47 years in the recycling
and solid waste industry. His career is an ex-
ample of how private enterprise and public
service can merge to create great benefits for
the entire community.
Gino is the son of a man rooted in the solid
waste industry. His father, Gino Sr., worked on
a truck. Gino Jr.’s fondest memory was of
hanging off the back of a garbage truck and
of making tags with his father. Fifty years ago,
garbage bills were collected door-to-door and
the tags were used in those collections.
He graduated from high school having start-
ed a proud tradition at San Carlos High—the
‘‘Nude Relays’’—an event that remained for
years after he graduated. His reputation, how-
ever, was districtwide. At another high school
in the district his sister, Dani, had to endure
the ever-present question from teachers, ‘‘Are
you related to Gino Gasparini?’’ His sister,
wisely, conceded the relationship and noted
that she was, indeed, Gino Sr.’s daughter.
Gino attended community college for two
years and then entered the solid waste busi-
ness. From 1972 to 1988, he collected gar-
bage along residential and business routes
from Burlingame to East Palo Alto. He began
his career in management in 1995 as the
manager in charge of day-to-day operations of
drivers and supervisory staff. He was a great
manager, often getting into the cab of a truck
to stay in touch with the challenges faced by
front-line employees.
Solid waste management on the San Fran-
cisco Peninsula has long been an advanced
form of industrial processing. When I served
on the San Mateo County Board of Super-
visors in the 1980’s, I organized the first
household hazardous waste pickup day. We
invited residents to drop off pesticides and
chemicals at the waste transfer station. A
chemist working for the county glanced into
the back of a station wagon and immediately

ordered that all persons in the vicinity pull
back 100 feet. The vehicle owner had placed
two potentially explosive chemicals next to
each other. Today, the operations of Recology
and its partner agencies manage a waste
stream that potentially includes waste oil, e-
waste, light bulbs of various types, household
batteries, paint, construction debris, and such
relatively benign products as cardboard,
paper, glass and metals.
Gino Gasparini was at the forefront of these
recycling efforts. Just a few years after my
well-intentioned event resulted in a small-scale
evacuation, Gino initiated voluntary recycling
at the curbside. In 1989, Gino’s effort was the
largest multi-jurisdictional residential recycling
program in the nation, Today, that effort is
mandatory, involves three large containers,
and diverts millions of tons of household and
commercial waste to the recycling stream.
This enterprise requires a knowledge of chem-
istry to avoid explosions and fires, and ‘‘adher-
ence to strict standards to avoid cross-con-
tamination of materials.
Gino participates regularly at city council
meetings, community meetings, and in leader-
ship positions at the Chamber of Commerce.
He is often at charitable fundraisers. From the
police athletic leagues to ‘‘walk for life’’ events
to environmental cleanups. Recology and Gino
Gasparini are both inseparable and unavoid-
able. They really care about the community.
Gino was honored as the Redwood City/San
Mateo County Chamber Person of the Year in
1996, the Redwood City PAL Citizen of the
Year in 2006 and received numerous other
awards over several decades. For over 20
years, Gino helped with the annual Redwood
City creek and neighborhood cleanup.
As he enters retirement, Gino will not be
alone. He will be joined by his wife, Jenny,
and he will be able to watch his four children
more closely: Adrianna, Daniel, Michael, and
Nicholas. One child is a teacher and the other
followed in the family tradition by entering the
solid waste industry.
Let me close by saying that to know Gino
Gasparini is to know a smile set amidst a
whirling dervish of activity. He can be relied
upon to think of his family and neighbors first.
He can be relied upon to use fairness to in-
fuse his judgment. He can be relied upon to
think of new ways to accomplish longstanding
objectives. He can be relied upon for a
straight answer to any question. In short, Gino
Gasparini is the man that everyone wants to
call when there is a problem, but he is also
the man everyone readily agrees to recognize
when tough jobs get done well.
I salute Gino upon his retirement. Civic fo-
rums will be different without him. Our streets
will be cleaner because of him. Our environ-
ment will benefit for years to come because of
the standards of performance that he created.
Good luck (Buona fortuna), Gino.

RECOGNIZING VICKI MASSIE OF
BILLINGS
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Vicki Massie of Billings for de-
veloping a program to provide computers to
students and organizations that need them,
and for recently setting up two needed com-
puter labs in a rural Montana school.
Vicki is the executive director of St. Vincent
de Paul in Billings, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to providing personalized service to
those in need. Four years ago, as the volun-
teer coordinator, she developed Project
R.E.B.O.O.T., or ‘‘Refurbished Electronics
Bringing Out Opportunities Together.’’ Project
REBOOT refurbishes donated computers and
distributes them to schools, students, and or-
ganizations in need. Since its inception,
Project REBOOT has given nearly 100 com-
puters to Montana students.
This spring, Vicki’s project helped fill a tre-
mendous need for students of the Northern
Cheyenne Tribal School. Elementary and high
school students at the small, rural school
shared one computer lab. Students faced an-
other challenge: the high school curriculum re-
quired supplemental work online, and there
were only nine laptops for 78 high school stu-
dents.
I one day, that changed.
Through Project REBOOT, Vicki brought 50
computers to the Northern Cheyenne Tribal
School. Vicki and her two sons, who work in
information technology at a nearby school dis-
trict, set up two new computer labs for stu-
dents at the school.
With greater resources and access to tech-
nology, the students of Northern Cheyenne
Tribal School, and all students Vicki has
helped through Project REBOOT, can improve
their skills and further open the doors of op-
portunity, be it in higher education or in the
workforce.
Madam Speaker, for her vision and dedica-
tion to expanding access to technology for
Montana students, I recognize Vicki Massie for
her spirit of Montana.

HONORING THE LIFE OF W.T.
JOHNSTON
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Newton Championship Coach,
community leader, teacher, preacher, hus-
band, father, grandfather, and father figure
W.T. Johnston, who went home to be with the
Lord on May 11, 2019, at the age of 54.
William T. (W.T.) Johnston was born on
March 28, 1965 in Poteau, OK. He attended
Henderson State University in Arkansas where
he played for the Reddies as a defensive end
from 1986–1988. His distinctions on and off
the field were noticed, and in 2019 he was
awarded with the Sporty Carpenter Award,
which is given in honor of Henderson State’s
legendary head football coach.
He moved to Newton in the early 1990’s
where he coached and taught. For the last
eight years, he was an outstanding head
coach for the Newton Eagles football team,
where he successfully led the Eagles to a 97–
15 record. Even later in his career, battling
Graft-versus-host disease, W.T. coached the
Newton Eagles to a victory win as Texas State
Champions in both 2017 and 2018.
W.T. married the love of his life Debra Short
on August 3, 1985 and together they raised
their two sons, Drew and Shaw. He had two
grandchildren, Jax and Reece. On April 22,
2019 Newton ISD announced that Drew would
be taking his father’s position as head coach.
William T. Johnston not only instilled the
message of God in his students and athletes,
but also inspired millions around the country
with his courageous message of never giving
up and hope. He has truly left a legacy, and
will be remembered for generations to come.
The Johnston Family will continue to be in my
prayers.

IN HONOR OF STEVE AND BECKY
RIGGLE
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today I rise in recognition of Steve and Becky
Riggle’s 50th wedding anniversary. Together,
this couple has been a blessing to the Hous-
ton area. I am proud to call them my friends
and recognize this significant milestone in their
lives.
Now a seasoned pastor, Steve first became
a licensed minister in 1969. Steve and Becky
later joined Grace International Churches and
Ministries, eventually starting a church in
Livermore, California. For almost a decade
they proudly served their church and grew the
ministry into the largest Protestant church in
the city—a truly incredible accomplishment.
After years of teaching others about God’s
mercy, Steve and Becky experienced it first
hand. While ministering at a remote prison in
the Philippines in 1978, they were attacked
and held hostage by four prisoners. The situa-
tion escalated when Steve was stabbed seven
times and Becky was shot and stabbed mul-
tiple times along her arms. Miraculously,
through God’s grace, the couple was able to
leave the hospital and head back to California
in just 18 days after the near fatal assault.
Becky subsequently had five major surgeries,
spent nine months in a body cast, and nine
more learning how to walk again. As
harrowing as this event was, Steve and Becky
held steadfast in their faith, and have since
praised God for his mercy for helping them
survive and continue to serve.
Fortunately, for our community, the Riggle
family made their way to the Lone Star State
in 1983, where they started the Grace Com-
munity Church in Houston, Texas. After many
years of growth, Grace Community Church
now has four thriving campuses and is the
church home to over 17,000 devoted individ-
uals.
Steve currently holds the title of Founding
Pastor at Grace, and serves as the Senior
Pastor at the Grace Woodland’s campus.
Steve’s service to our community does not
stop at the pulpit. He also sits on the execu-
tive team of the Houston Area’s Pastor Coun-
cil, is a Board member of The King’s Univer-
sity, and currently serves as the President of
Grace International—a group of 3,500 church-
es with ministries in over 100 nations. Becky
is also incredibly active in our community, and
leads a local women’s ministry and bible
study. A gifted motivational speaker, she
speaks at a variety of conferences for women,
both across the country and internationally.

their greatest accomplishment is their wonder-
ful family, which includes two children, five
grandchildren, and three great grandchildren. I
am proud to join their family, colleagues, and
friends in congratulating them on their golden
anniversary. I wish Steve and Becky all the

INTRODUCING SENATOR LUGAR
POST OFFICE BILL
HON. ANDRÉ CARSON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 6, 2019
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I
rise to introduce a bill to name a U.S. Post Of-
fice in Indianapolis in honor of Senator Rich-
ard Lugar. Senator Lugar, who served as
mayor of Indianapolis from 1968 to 1975, also
represented Indiana honorably in the U.S.
Senate from 1977 to 2013. He was a brilliant
scholar, a brave member of our armed forces,
and a dedicated public servant who cham-
pioned people and principle over party.
His distinguished life demonstrates the type
of leader that Indiana cultivates, and his public
service is an unquestionable example of his
deep commitment to our country. He was not
only a pillar of strength in his local community,
but he was also a trusted, unfailing personi-
fication of excellence in national leadership.
That excellence pervaded everything that
Senator Lugar achieved in life, beginning early
in his youth. He participated in youth organiza-
tions, reaching the highest achievement attain-
able in the Boy Scouts of America—the rank
of Eagle Scout.
After completing his studies at Denison Uni-
versity, he studied at Oxford as a Rhodes
Scholar. Following graduation, he served in
the United States Navy as an intelligence offi-
cer.
His political career began shortly thereafter,
upon his return to Indianapolis. He promptly
began contributing to the well-being of the
community in Indianapolis, serving on the local
school board and then becoming mayor in
1968.
Following his mayoral service, Lugar ran for
the United State Senate, and he was elected
in 1976. It was in the Senate where Richard
Lugar truly became the resilient and formi-
dable political leader that we have come to
recognize. He served as the Chairman of the
Senate Agricultural Committee, where he gar-
nered bipartisan support for farm program re-
forms, initiated the biofuels research program,
reformed the food stamp program, and pre-
served the federal school lunch program. He
also served 34 years on the Senate Foreign
Relations committee, including two terms as
chair. In this capacity, he was a leader in re-
ducing the threat of nuclear, chemical, and bi-
ological weapons through the passage and im-
plementation of the Nunn-Lugar program. He
also played an essential role in enactment of
sanctions against the Apartheid government of
South Africa and the U.S. recognition of
democratic government in the Philippines. He
contributed to the expansion of the NATO Alli-
ance, the implementation of the U.S. Presi-
dent’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
(PEPFAR) to end the global AIDS epidemic,
and the ratification of anti-terrorist treaties. For
all he accomplished, he was awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013. He
was awarded 47 honorary degrees and re-
ceived numerous other awards. When he
passed away, he was the President of the
Lugar Center, a non-profit organization focus-
ing on global food security, Weapons of Mass
Destruction proliferation, aid effectiveness, and
bipartisan governance.
His commitment to good governance and di-
plomacy, particularly his tireless efforts on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made
our world a better, safer place. He won the re-
spect of people across the political spectrum
and earned that Presidential Medal of Free-
dom in 2013 from President Obama—our na-
tion’s highest civilian honor.
In our increasingly divided society, everyone
can help his legacy live on by pledging to ad-
vance the Hoosier values of bipartisanship
and cooperation that defined Senator Richard
Lugar’s life.
This bill is supported by the entire Indiana
delegation, and I urge all my colleagues to join
me in supporting this effort.
