PRAYER
Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Cap-
itol Hill United Methodist Church,
Washington, D.C., offered the following
prayer:
God of love and truth, thank You for
each servant in the people’s House,
Members and staff alike, and all they
sacrifice to serve.
On the eve of Dr. King’s holiday, fill
us with the faith of Your servant Mar-
tin when he proclaimed, ‘‘I believe that
unarmed truth and unconditional love
will have the final word. . . .’’
So Lord, disarm us today. Help us
hand over our weapons of word and ac-
tion that intend to wound our per-
ceived opponents. Then help us hear
the deep truths of all our constituents,
especially the most vulnerable among
us, and of Your children in need around
the world.
Remove the conditions we impose on
what we believe is possible so that
today Your unconditional love will
lead us not only to a just resolution of
the shutdown and the end of the pain it
is causing, but to becoming a country
and a globe that looks more like Your
kingdom, so that we, like Dr. King,
leave this world better because of our
courageous actions today.
Amen.

CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIA-
TIONS ACT, 2019
The following is an explanation of
the Consolidated Appropriations Act,
2019.
This Act includes 6 regular appropriations
bills for fiscal year 2019. The divisions con-
tained in the Act are as follows:
∑ Division A—Agriculture, Rural Develop-
ment, Food and Drug Administration, and

∑ Division D—Department of the Interior,
Environment, and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Act, 2019
∑ Division E—Department of State, For-
eign Operations, and Related Programs Ap-
propriations Act, 2019
∑ Division F—Transportation, Housing and
Urban Development, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 2019
∑ Division G—Other Matter
Section 1 of the Act is the short title of the
bill.
Section 2 of the Act displays a table of con-
tents.
Section 3 of the Act states that, unless ex-
pressly provided otherwise, any reference to
‘‘this Act’’ contained in any division shall be
treated as referring only to the provisions of
that division.
Section 4 of the Act states that this ex-
planatory statement shall have the same ef-
fect with respect to the allocation of funds
and implementation of this legislation as if
it were a joint explanatory statement of a
committee of conference.
Section 5 of the Act provides a statement
of appropriations.
Section 6 of the Act states that each
amount designated by Congress as being for
Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War
on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) is contingent on
the President so designating all such OCO/
GWOT amounts and transmitting such des-
ignations to Congress. The provision is con-
sistent with the requirements in the Budget
Control Act of 2011.
The Act includes language in Division G to
provide departments and agencies funded in
the Act with the necessary authorities to
provide backpay to employees as soon as
practicable in accordance with section
1341(c) of title 31, United States Code (as
added by the Government Employee Fair
Treatment Act of 2019). It is the Committee’s
intent to cover all required obligations for
Federal employees for the period which
began on or about December 22, 2018 during
which there occurred a lapse in appropria-
tions. In addition, Division G includes lan-
guage to reimburse State, or other Federal
grantees consistent with prior precedent fol-
lowing a lapse in appropriations.
The Act does not contain any congres-
sional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or lim-
ited tariff benefits as defined by clause 9 of
rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
DIVISION A—AGRICULTURE, RURAL DE-
VELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINIS-
TRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES AP-
PROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019
CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVES
The statement is silent on provisions that
were in both the House Report (H.Rpt. 115–
706) and Senate Report (S.Rpt. 115–259) that
remain unchanged, except as noted herein.
The statement notes that executive branch
wishes cannot substitute for Congress’s own
statements as to the best evidence of con-
gressional intentions, which are the official
reports of the Congress. The statement fur-
ther points out that funds in this Act must
be used for the purposes for which appro-
priated, as required by section 1301 of title 31
of the United States Code, which provides:
‘‘Appropriations shall be applied only to the
objects for which the appropriations were
made except as otherwise provided by law.’’
The House and Senate report language
that is not changed by the statement is ap-
proved and indicates congressional inten-
tions. This statement, while repeating some
report language for emphasis, does not in-
tend to negate the language referred to
above unless expressly provided herein.
In cases in which the House or the Senate
have directed the submission of a report,
such report is to be submitted to both the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions no later than 60 days after enactment
of this Act, unless otherwise directed.
Hereafter, in division A of this statement,
the term the Committees’ refers to the Com-
mittees on Appropriations of the House of
Representatives and the Senate.
For the appropriations provided by this
Act and previous Acts, the departments and
agencies funded by this bill are reminded
that the Committees use the definitions for
transfer, reprogramming, and program,
project, and activity as defined by the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO) in
GAO–04–261SP Appropriations Law—Vol. I
and GAO–05–734SP Budget Glossary.
A transfer is the shifting of funds between
appropriations. It applies to (1) transfers
from one agency to another, (2) transfers
from one account to another within the same
agency, and (3) transfers to an interagency
or intra-agency working fund. In each in-
stance, statutory authority is required.
Reprogramming is the utilization of funds
in an appropriation account for purposes
other than those contemplated at the time of
appropriation. It is the shifting of funds from
one object to another within an appropria-
tion.
A program, project, or activity (PPA) is an
element within a budget account. PPAs are
identified by reference to include the most
specific level of budget items identified in
the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food
and Drug Administration, and Related Agen-
cies Act, 2019, accompanying Committee re-
ports, explanatory statements, the State-
ment of Managers, and budget justifications.
Program activity structures are intended to
provide a meaningful representation of the
operations financed by a specific budget ac-
count by project, activity, or organization.
For fiscal year 2019, the Committees con-
tinue to include bill language requiring ad-
vanced notification of certain agency ac-
tions. Notification will be required at least
30 days in advance of any action if (1) a
major capital investment is modified; (2) an
office is realigned or reorganized; and (3) ac-
tivities are carried out that were not de-
scribed in the budget request.
The statement directs the Office of Budget
and Program Analysis (OBPA) of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to pro-
vide an organizational chart for each agency
funded by this Act to the division and sub-
division level, as appropriate, by March 1,
2019.
The statement also directs the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and the Farm
Credit Administration (FCA) to provide an
organizational chart of each agency respec-
tively to the division and subdivision level,
as appropriate, by March 1, 2019.
Further, USDA and FDA should be mindful
of Congressional authority to determine and
set final funding levels for fiscal year 2020.
Therefore, the agencies should not pre-
suppose program funding outcomes and pre-
maturely initiate action to redirect staffing
prior to knowing final outcomes on fiscal
year 2020 program funding. The statement di-
rects OBPA to provide the Committees with
the number of staff years and employees on
board for each agency funded by this Act on
a quarterly basis.
TITLE I
AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS
PROCESSING, RESEARCH AND MARKETING
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The bill provides $46,603,000 for the Office
of the Secretary.
In addition to updates provided to the
Committees, the Department is directed to
include in its fiscal year 2020 Congressional
Justification, as a single exhibit, a table list-
ing all deliverables, with a column for due
dates if applicable.
The bill includes continued investment to-
wards providing access to high-speed
broadband infrastructure and services to
rural areas of the United States. The bill
continues to provide resources for broadband
deployment through the Broadband Loan
program, Community Connect grant pro-
gram, Distance Learning and Telemedicine
program and an additional $550,000,000 for the
broadband pilot program established in sec-
tion 779 of division A of the Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2018 (Public Law 115–141).
To ensure these investments are maximized,
the Department is reminded to avoid efforts
that could duplicate existing networks built
by private investment or those built
leveraging and utilizing other federal pro-
grams; the Secretary of Agriculture is di-
rected to coordinate with the Federal Com-
munications Commission (FCC) and the Na-
tional Telecommunications Information Ad-
ministration (NTIA) to ensure wherever pos-
sible that broadband loans and grants issued
under the broadband programs are targeted
to areas that are currently unserved. In par-
ticular, USDA is directed to utilize the
NTIA’s assessment of the current state of
broadband access nationwide, which includes
the identification of existing infrastructure,
gaps, and opportunities for more efficient de-
ployment.
In implementing a strategy for broadband
deployment to unserved communities, the
Department shall explore utilizing all tech-
nologies, including but not limited to, fiber,
cable modem, fixed wireless, and television
white space as a means of building sustain-
able rural infrastructure for the modern
economy. The amounts made available for
the broadband pilot program, as with the
Rural Economic Development Loan Program
shall remain available until expended.
The Secretary is encouraged to work with
stakeholders to develop accepted remedi-
ation protocols that will allow for the
repurposing of poultry growing facilities into
controlled environment agriculture facilities
safe for food production.
There is bill language authorizing a law
enforcement protection operation for the
Secretary and other officials of the Depart-
ment, reflecting a finding that the Depart-
ment has a bona fide security concern rel-
ative to providing a law enforcement protec-
tion operation, including secure transpor-
tation for both official and personal pur-
poses.
There is concern about the unknown costs
associated with the proposed move of the Na-
tional Institutes of Food and Agriculture
and the Economic Research Service to a new
location outside of the National Capital Re-
gion. In submitting the fiscal year 2020 budg-
et justification, the Department is directed
to include all cost estimates for the proposed
move of the two agencies, as well as a de-
tailed analysis of any research benefits of
their relocation. There is an expectation
that this process will be followed in the fu-
ture for any other potential proposed agency
relocations by the Department.
The Department is directed to delay indefi-
nitely the proposed transfer of ERS to the
Office of the Chief Economist. At this time,
it is appropriate for ERS to remain under
the Research, Education and Economics mis-
sion area, as several questions remain about
the merits of the proposed transfer as well as
the proposed relocation of ERS outside of
the National Capital Region. Insufficient in-
formation and justification relating to the
reorganization and relocation make moving
forward on these proposals premature at this
time.

January 18, 2019
The cost-benefit analysis of the National
Finance Center and accompanying suffi-
ciency review by the Comptroller General of

ing of any changes to remove or relocate any

AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The bill provides $1,303,266,000 for the Agri-
cultural Research Service (ARS), Salaries
and Expenses.
The President’s budget request regarding
the termination of research programs, redi-
rections of research programs, or closure of
research locations is not accepted. Extra-
mural research shall be funded at no less
than the fiscal year 2018 levels. There are
funding increases for cotton ginning, alfalfa,
small grains genomics, postharvest dairy re-
search, marine aquaculture seedstock, sugar-
cane, high performance computing, sugar
beets, salmonella, the Pollinator Center,
warmwater aquaculture, poultry, fruit fly

silient dryland research, wheat and sorghum,
shellfish genetics, sudden oak death, indus-
trial hemp, oats, cranberry and blueberry re-
search, whitefly research, and human nutri-
tion.
It is recognized that the Department pro-
poses to transfer the responsibility for oper-
ational planning, and future operations of
the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility
(NBAF) to USDA and support the fiscal year
2019 funding request to allow NBAF to be
fully operational by December 31, 2022. The
efforts of the joint DHS/USDA transition
team working to identify and outline transi-
tion activities to address all requirements
for the timely operational stand-up of NBAF
are appreciated. The bill provides $10,600,000
to address one-time costs associated with the
transfer of the science program from the
Plum Island Animal Disease Center to NBAF
and $42,000,000 to address stand-up activities
and other initial costs to operate and main-
tain the facility.
NBAF will provide the U.S. with expanded
capacity to implement a comprehensive bio-
defense research program to protect against
foreign animal diseases that pose the great-
est threats to animal agriculture and public
health. The bill provides an additional
$5,000,000 for ARS to increase research efforts
on foreign animal diseases and emerging dis-
eases with high consequence to animal and
public health.
The Committees have read the quarterly
reports on animal welfare issues submitted
by ARS. While providing helpful informa-
tion, on some issues, ARS did not report a
single specific negative finding by APHIS in-
spectors, despite the fact that numerous vio-
lations have been found involving the death
of numerous animals and serious health
issues of many more. The failure to report
these problems to the Committees is unac-
ceptable. ARS is directed to submit a single
report covering all violations found by
APHIS to date and the specific actions taken
to prevent them from recurring within 60
days of enactment. It is also directed to con-
tinue to submit quarterly reports that in-
clude all violations found by APHIS during
that quarter and the specific actions that
will be taken to prevent their recurrence.
The quarterly reports shall also include each
issue found by APHIS inspectors at the pre-
compliance inspections of newly-covered re-
search activities and the remedial actions
taken.
The need for advancements in dryland pro-
duction practices, cropping, and equipment
to increase profitability, conserve the soil,
enhance soil water storage, promote soil
health, and decrease reliance on herbicides is
recognized. The bill provides an additional
$2,000,000 to expand research focused on resil-
ient dryland farming.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
The bill provides $381,200,000 for ARS
Buildings and Facilities for the next highest
priorities identified on the 2012 USDA ARS
Capital Investment Strategy and 2015 ARS
Co-located Cooperator Facility Report.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND
AGRICULTURE
RESEARCH AND EDUCATION ACTIVITIES
The bill provides $927,649,000 for the Na-
tional Institute of Food and Agriculture, Re-
search and Education Activities.
There is bill language providing $5,000,000
for grants to the three Centers of Excellence
established at the 1890 Land Grant Univer-
sities on the occasion of the 125th anniver-
sary of the Second Morrill Act of 1890.

The marketplace continues to develop in-
novative technologies, such as third-party
mobile applications, which can assist nutri-

benefits. USDA is encouraged to ensure that
these new technologies have a secure system
in place to protect personal account infor-
mation; do not sell, distribute or make avail-
able personal account information for com-
mercial marketing purposes; and that par-
ticipants have consistent access to their ac-
count information regardless of the means in
which they choose to access it.
Retailer SNAP sales data should be treated
as proprietary and confidential information.
Should such information be made publicly
available, USDA is directed to make every
effort to protect confidential business infor-
mation likely to cause harm to the competi-
tive position in the retail industry, espe-
cially small grocery stores and small grocery
stores in rural areas. Personal information
about individual SNAP participants should
also remain confidential.

technologies, including telemedicine, that
support breastfeeding mothers through ac-
cess to professional breastfeeding and nutri-

vides $5,000,000 for telehealth competitive
grants to supplement the nutrition edu-
cation and breastfeeding support offered in

The work of the National Academies of
Science (NAS) to review and make rec-

packages to reflect current science and cul-
tural factors is recognized. It is noted, how-
ever, that while all revised packages now
allow some fish, the amounts remain low
compared to the recommendations of other
authoritative health agencies. The Depart-
ment is strongly encouraged to consider the
health and cultural benefits of fish consump-
tion as the NAS recommendations are re-
viewed and used to inform the Department’s
next course of action. The Department is
strongly encouraged to continue to allow
states to submit cultural food package pro-
posals to respond to the cultural preferences
of WIC participants in states like Alaska.

H764 January 18, 2019
DIVISION B—COMMERCE, JUSTICE,
SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES AP-
PROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019
Report language included in House Report
115–704 (‘‘the House report’’) or Senate Re-
port 115–275 (‘‘the Senate report’’) that is not
changed by this explanatory statement or
the Act is approved. The explanatory state-
ment, while repeating some language for em-
phasis, is not intended to negate the lan-
guage referred to above unless expressly pro-
vided herein. In cases where both the House
report and the Senate report address a par-
ticular issue not specifically addressed in the
explanatory statement, the House report and
the Senate report should be read as con-
sistent and are to be interpreted accordingly.
In cases where the House report or the Sen-
ate report directs the submission of a report,
such report is to be submitted to both the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions (‘‘the Committees’’).
Each department and agency funded in this
Act shall follow the directions set forth in
this Act and the accompanying explanatory
statement, and shall not reallocate resources
or reorganize activities except as provided
herein. Reprogramming procedures shall
apply to: funds provided in this Act; unobli-
gated balances from previous appropriations
Acts that are available for obligation or ex-
penditure in fiscal year 2019; and non-appro-
priated resources such as fee collections that
are used to meet program requirements in
fiscal year 2019. These procedures are speci-
fied in section 505 of this Act.
Any reprogramming request shall include
any out-year budgetary impacts and a sepa-
rate accounting of program or mission im-
pacts on estimated carryover funds. Any pro-
gram, project, or activity cited in this ex-
planatory statement, or in the House report
or the Senate report and not changed by this
Act, shall be construed as the position of the
Congress and shall not be subject to reduc-
tions or reprogramming without prior ap-
proval of the Committees. Further, any de-
partment or agency funded in this Act that
plans a reduction-in-force shall notify the
Committees by letter no later than 30 days
in advance of the date of any such planned
personnel action.
When a department or agency submits a
reprogramming or transfer request to the
Committees and does not receive identical
responses, it shall be the responsibility of
the department or agency seeking the re-
programming to reconcile the differences be-
tween the two bodies before proceeding. If
reconciliation is not possible, the items in
disagreement in the reprogramming or
transfer request shall be considered unap-
proved. Departments and agencies shall not
submit reprogramming notifications after
July 1, 2019, except in extraordinary cir-
cumstances. Any such notification shall in-
clude a description of the extraordinary cir-
cumstances.
In compliance with section 533 of this Act,
each department and agency funded in this
Act shall submit spending plans, signed by
the respective department or agency head,
for the Committees’ review not later than 45
days after enactment.
TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION
OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
The agreement includes $495,000,000 in total
resources for the International Trade Admin-
istration (ITA). This amount is offset by
$11,000,000 in estimated fee collections, re-
sulting in a direct appropriation of
$484,000,000. The agreement provides no less
than $88,500,000 for Enforcement and Compli-
ance and no less than $320,000,000 for Global
Markets. The agreement adopts Senate re-
port language regarding SelectUSA.
U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service
(US&FCS).—The agreement rejects the pro-
posed cuts to the US&FCS and provides no
less than the amount provided in fiscal year
2018. ITA shall submit quarterly reports to
the Committees, due not later than 30 days
after the end of each quarter, detailing staff-
ing levels within the US&FCS, including a
breakout of Foreign Service Officers, Locally
Engaged Staff, and U.S. field staff. These re-
ports shall also include obligations by object
class for the US&FCS for the given quarter,
and shall include a comparison of staffing
and obligation levels for the same quarter in
the past three fiscal years along with an ex-
planation of any significant variances com-
pared to the prior year quarters. The first
such report shall include a discussion of the
reasons for ITA not maintaining Foreign
Service Officer staffing within the funding
provided for the US&FCS over the last three
fiscal years.
BUREAU OF INDUSTRY AND SECURITY
OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement includes $118,050,000 for the
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).
The agreement does not adopt House re-
port language relating to the division of
funds between Export Administration, Ex-

new independent cost estimate, the Sec-
retary’s estimate includes additional as-
sumptions to enhance the robustness and re-
liability of the program. For example, the
new estimate assumes the need for addi-
tional in-person follow-up visits due to fewer
households expected to initially respond to
the Census. In addition, the Census Bureau is
directed to provide the Committees with no-
tification 15 days before any spending it in-
tends to incur in fiscal year 2019 that is
above the amounts included in the October
2017 life-cycle cost estimate for fiscal year
2019.

Ocean Exploration and Research.—The
agreement adopts House and Senate report
language regarding ocean exploration and re-
search. The agreement supports the use of
existing tele-presence technology, and ap-
plied exploration, to map critically impor-
tant mineral deposits within America’s ex-
clusive economic zone and sites of sub-
merged human history, particularly in the
Pacific.
Multi-Function Phased Array Radar (MPAR)
Program.—The fiscal year 2018 appropriations
Act directed NOAA to maintain its leader-
ship in the Spectrum Efficient National Sur-
veillance Radar (SENSR) Program. There is
frustration with the decision to de-scope the
SENSR program by removing the high-reso-
lution weather sensing requirements, and
concern that NOAA is unprepared to execute
a weather radar follow-on program. In lieu of
Senate language, the agreement directs
OAR, in coordination with the National
Weather Service, to develop and submit to
the Committees, within 90 days of enactment
of this Act, a weather radar follow-on re-
search-to-operations transition plan, in ac-
cordance with the requirements for agency
transition plans set forth under NOAA Ad-
ministrative Order 216–105B, section 3.06.
Oceanographic Research Partnership Pro-
gram.—$5,500,000 is for NOAA to advance
ocean science research through the program
established under 10 U.S.C. 7901. Senate guid-
ance for this funding and support for Ocean
Joint Technology Transfer Initiative
projects funded in fiscal year 2018 is adopted.
Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI).—
House language regarding JTTI is adopted.
Of the amount provided for JTTI, up to
$5,000,000 shall be available to pursue innova-
tive, modern techniques to accelerate the
transition of weather research to operations.
Highly Migratory Species.—In lieu of House
and Senate language under NMFS, the agree-
ment provides up to $2,000,000 within OAR for
the Sea Grant program to partner with State
agencies, academia, and the fishing industry
to research highly migratory fish species in
the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic. This
should include examining the impact of off-
shore oil platforms on the biology of highly
migratory species, such as yellow fin tuna.
Highly migratory species, and the coastal
communities that rely on the health of these
stocks, could greatly benefit from improved,
science-based management and conservation.

Quarterly Briefings.—The fiscal year 2018
appropriations Act directed the NWS to pro-
vide quarterly briefings to the Committees
on all NWS management and budget issues.
The agreement adopts House and Senate lan-
guage regarding such reporting. However,
there is frustration and disappointment that
the NWS was unable to provide any quar-
terly briefings during fiscal year 2018. The
American people entrust the NWS with more
than $1,000,000,000 each year to provide accu-
rate weather forecasting. It is unacceptable
that the NWS is unwilling or unable to re-
port to the Committees on its operations.
The leadership of the Department of Com-
merce and NOAA shall ensure NWS improves
the transparency of its operations and pro-
vides quarterly briefings on management and
budget issues to the Committees.
National Mesonet Program.—The agreement
adopts Senate report language on the Na-
tional Mesonet Program and provides
$19,000,000 for these activities.
Advanced Weather Interactive Processing Sys-
tem (AWIPS).—Within the increased funding
for Central Processing, the agreement fully
funds the request for the AWIPS Cyclical Re-
freshment.
Facilities Maintenance.—Within funding for
Analyze, Forecast, and Support, the agree-
ment provides $8,000,000 for the National
Weather Service’s highest priority facilities
repair and deferred maintenance require-
ments at Weather Forecast Offices. Thirty
days prior to obligating any of these addi-
tional facilities repair and deferred mainte-
nance funds, NWS shall submit a report pro-
viding: (1) a prioritized list of NWS deferred
facilities maintenance needs, based on the
facilities condition assessment; and (2) an es-
timate of the total amount and composition
of deferred facilities maintenance. In subse-
quent fiscal years, NOAA shall request re-
sources in line with the September 2017 NWS
Facilities Strategic Plan.
Dissemination.—House report language re-
garding the Integrated Dissemination Pro-
gram system is not adopted.
National Water Center (NWC) Operations.—
The agreement adopts Senate language
under NWS for the NWC and provides an ad-
ditional $1,500,000 within Analyze, Forecast,
and Support to expedite hiring within the
NWC Water Prediction Operations Division.
The increasing prevalence and severity of
flooding events results in loss of life and bil-
lions of dollars of property damage. While
NOAA has made progress in developing next-
generation water modeling capabilities, such
as the National Water Model, it is impera-
tive that these technologies be transitioned
into operations to enable more accurate and
longer range flood forecasts. Objective 3.3 of
the Department of Commerce’s Strategic
Plan directs NOAA to begin demonstrating
these capabilities. Therefore, NWS should
also simultaneously be preparing to
operationalize these capabilities. NWS is di-
rected to develop and make public, by the
end of fiscal year 2019, an operations and
services policy directive that defines na-
tional instructions on operations at the
NWC, and the content and provision of NWC
products and services. Further, such policy
should establish the NWC as the operational
center of excellence for water prediction and
related decision support services within
NOAA.
National Environmental Satellite, Data and
Information Service (NESDIS).—$242,666,000 is
for National Environmental Satellite, Data
and Information Service Operations, Re-
search, and Facilities.

TITLE III
SCIENCE
OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY
The agreement includes $5,544,000 for the
Office of Science and Technology Policy
(OSTP).
Emerging Contaminants.—OSTP submitted
the ‘‘Plan for Addressing Critical Research
Gaps Related to Emerging Contaminants in
Drinking Water’’ in October 2018. Within 90
days of the enactment of this agreement,
OSTP shall update the implementation plan
included in that report, including identifying
budgetary resources required, by agency, for
fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021.
NATIONAL SPACE COUNCIL
The agreement includes $1,965,000 for the
activities of the National Space Council.
Execution of Space Programs.—Under Execu-
tive Order 13803, the National Space Council
(the Council) is directed to, among other du-
ties, ‘‘develop recommendations for the
President on space policy and space-related
issues’’ and ‘‘foster close coordination, co-
operation, and technology and information
exchange among the civil, national security,
and commercial space sectors.’’ In executing
these duties, the Council is reminded that, in
recent years, poor workmanship, poor over-
sight, and poor performance (e.g., flawed
welding techniques, component tube con-
tamination, incorrect cleaning methods,
using the wrong voltage in testing, unreli-
able launch vehicle bolt cutter assembly,
mishandling of rocket stages during trans-
port, and substandard strut components)
have led to costly delays and even loss of
mission. Overly ambitious technology devel-
opment, optimistic scheduling, and poor cost
estimation have become common. No type of
contract vehicle seems immune, whether
traditional cost-plus contracts or firm, fixed-
price contracts are used. These are inherent,
systemic problems that cannot continue. Na-
tional security, technology development, sci-
entific discoveries, and improved weather
forecasting are too important to the future
of the Nation and require the Council to ad-
dress these issues.
NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE
ADMINISTRATION
The agreement includes $21,500,000,000 for
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration (NASA). The agreement includes
substantial new resources for activities re-
lated to Moon exploration and retains lan-
guage regarding submission of a detailed re-
port prior to obligating certain funds. As
noted elsewhere in this statement, the lack
of progress across science and exploration
programs despite continued significant and
sustained investments in these programs is
dismaying. Reports by the NASA Inspector
General (IG), the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO), and independent ex-
perts point to a number of deficiencies that
NASA and its private sector partners must
address. During fiscal year 2019, NASA is ex-
pected to show marked success in addressing
the myriad deficiencies identified by over-
sight bodies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H774 January 18, 2019
Planetary Science.—The agreement includes
$2,758,500,000 for Planetary Science. The
agreement adopts House language regarding
the Europa Clipper and Lander missions
modified to reflect launch dates of 2023 for
the Clipper and 2025 for the Lander. The
agreement includes $97,000,000 for the Double
Asteroid Redirection Test and no less than
the fiscal year 2018 level for NEOcam. The
agreement includes up to $218,000,000 for the
Lunar Discovery and Exploration program,
including $21,000,000 for the Lunar Recon-
naissance Orbiter. The agreement adopts
Senate language regarding the helicopter
technology demonstration planned for Mars
2020.
Astrophysics.—The agreement includes
$1,191,600,000 for Astrophysics, including
$98,300,000 for Hubble Space Telescope oper-
ations and $45,000,000 for Education and Pub-
lic Outreach activities. The agreement does
not adopt House language regarding certain
work with private sector or philanthropic or-
ganizations.
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope
(WFIRST).—The agreement includes no less
than $312,200,000 for WFIRST. The agreement
emphasizes and reiterates House and Senate
language regarding cost overruns, schedule
delays, and adherence to the $3,200,000,000
cost cap. The agreement also includes
$10,000,000 for starshade technology develop-
ment and $10,000,000 for search for life tech-
nology development.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).—The
agreement includes $304,600,000 for JWST.
There is profound disappointment with both
NASA and its contractors regarding mis-
management, complete lack of careful over-
sight, and overall poor basic workmanship
on JWST, which has undergone two signifi-
cant reviews because of failures on the part
of NASA and its commercial sector partner.
NASA and its commercial partners seem to
believe that congressional funding for this
project and other development efforts is an
entitlement, unaffected by failures to stay
on schedule or within budget. This attitude
ignores the opportunity cost to other NASA
activities that must be sacrificed or delayed.
The agreement includes a general provision
to adjust the cap for JWST to $8,802,700,000,
an increase of $802,700,000 above the previous
cap. NASA should strictly adhere to this cap
or, under this agreement, JWST will have to
find cost savings or cancel the mission.
NASA and its contractors are expected to
implement the recommendations of both the
most recent independent review and the pre-
vious Casani report and to continue coopera-
tion with JWST’s standing review board. The
agreement does not adopt the reorganization
of JWST into Astrophysics, and the JWST
Program Office shall continue the reporting
structure adopted after the Casani report
and reiterated by the recent Webb Inde-
pendent Review Board.
Heliophysics.—The agreement includes
$720,000,000 for Heliophysics, including
$15,000,000 for a Space Weather Science Ap-
plications Project.
AERONAUTICS
The agreement includes $725,000,000 for
Aeronautics, including no less than
$35,000,000 for hypersonic research activities
as directed by the House. The agreement
modifies House language regarding air mo-
bility and automation and directs that this
report be submitted within 90 days of enact-
ment of this agreement.
SPACE TECHNOLOGY
The agreement includes $926,900,000 for
Space Technology. The agreement reiterates
House and Senate language regarding the
need to maintain an independent research
and technology portfolio to support both
science and human exploration programs. It
is understood that NASA has further refined
internal oversight responsibility for pro-
grams within this account and the Explo-
ration account and directs NASA to make
adjustments as necessary in the fiscal year
2019 spending plan. The agreement includes
$180,000,000 for RESTORE-L; $20,000,000 for
the Flight Opportunities Program; $35,000,000
for additive manufacturing; $48,100,000 for
solar electric propulsion activities; $5,000,000
for NASA’s regional economic development
program; $5,000,000 for innovative use of
nanomaterials; $2,000,000 to address chal-
lenges associated with high-speed crosslink
and downlink communications for low Earth
orbit small satellite constellations; and not
less than $100,000,000 for the development of
nuclear thermal propulsion, of which not less
than $70,000,000 shall be for the design of a
flight demonstration by 2024 for which a
multi-year plan is required by both the
House and the Senate within 180 days of en-
actment of this agreement.
EXPLORATION
The agreement includes $5,050,800,000 for
Exploration. The recommendation includes
$2,150,000,000 for the Space Launch System,
including no less than $150,000,000 to ensure
continued work developing the Exploration
Upper Stage (EUS). The bill also provides
$48,000,000 for launch capabilities and infra-
structure associated with constructing a sec-
ond mobile launch platform. There is strong
support for the development of the EUS in
order to ensure that NASA has sufficient
heavy lift capabilities to support a regular
cadence of heavy lift science and human ex-
ploration missions. NASA shall allocate suf-
ficient funding to ensure that both the EUS
and the second mobile launch platform will
be ready for flight no later than 2024. The
agreement provides not less than $145,000,000
for the Human Research Program;
$176,200,000 for habitation, airlock for dock-
ing vehicles and other logistics activities as
requested; adopts House and Senate direc-
tion regarding lunar lander-related language
and provides up to $116,500,000 for Advanced
Cislunar and Surface Capabilities; and
$450,000,000 for the Lunar Orbital Platform.
SPACE OPERATIONS
The agreement provides $4,639,100,000 for
Space Operations, and includes $40,000,000 for
commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) develop-
ment, as recommended by the Senate, for
LEO port implementation analysis and other
activities to enable future commercial ac-
tivities at the International Space Station.
The agreement maintains 21st Century Space
Launch Complex language as directed by the
Senate. The agreement includes up to
$60,000,000 for test facilities as directed by
the House. In lieu of House or Senate direc-
tion regarding launch vehicles for small pay-
loads, the agreement encourages NASA to
work as appropriate to increase opportuni-
ties for improved access to space.
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND
MATHEMATICS ENGAGEMENT
The agreement includes $110,000,000 for
Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics Engagement, including
$21,000,000 for the Established Program to
Stimulate Competitive Research; $44,000,000
for Space Grant; $33,000,000 for the Minority
University Research and Education Project;
and no less than $5,000,000 for the Competi-
tive Program for Science Museums, Plan-
etariums, and NASA Visitor Centers within
the STEM Education and Accountability
Projects. The agreement reiterates House
and Senate direction regarding administra-
tive costs.
SAFETY, SECURITY AND MISSION SERVICES
The agreement includes $2,755,000,000 for
Safety, Security and Mission Services. The
agreement modifies House language regard-
ing submission of reports from NASA pursu-
ant to National Academy of Public Adminis-
tration, GAO, and NASA IG reviews of NASA
security compliance protocols and foreign
national access management and directs
that these reports be provided annually. The
agreement adopts House language in this ac-
count and Senate language from the Science
account regarding cloud computing services
and directs that this report be submitted
within 90 days of enactment of this agree-
ment.

bill notes that the bipartisan Satellite Tele-
vision Extension and Localism Reauthoriza-
tion (STELAR) Act of 2014 was enacted to
promote consumers’ access to television
broadcast station signals that originate in
their state of residence, with an emphasis on
localism and the cultural and economic im-
portance of local programming. Congress’s
intent was to ensure Americans have access
to local broadcast and media content. The
bill notes that many broadcast stations do
not neatly conform to Nielsen-measured des-
ignated market area boundaries, preventing
many satellite television viewers from ac-
cessing local news, politics, sports, and
emergency programming. The bill notes that
despite the reforms made in STELAR, many
communities continue to struggle with mar-
ket modification petitions. The FCC should
provide a full analysis to ensure decisions on
market modification are comprehensively
reviewed and STELAR’s intent to promote
localism is retained. The FCC is directed to
adhere to statutory requirements and con-
gressional intent when taking administra-
tive action under STELAR.

H818 January 18, 2019
DIVISION D—DEPARTMENT OF THE INTE-
RIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED
AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019
The following statement is an explanation
of the effects of Division D, which provides
appropriations for the Department of the In-
terior, the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy (EPA), the Forest Service, the Indian
Health Service, and related agencies for fis-
cal year 2019.
The explanatory statement accompanying
this Act is approved and indicates congres-
sional intent. Report language contained in
House Report 115–765 and Senate Report 115–
276 providing specific guidance to agencies
regarding the administration of appropriated
funds and any corresponding reporting re-
quirements carries the same emphasis as the
language included in this explanatory state-
ment and should be complied with unless
specifically addressed to the contrary herein.
This explanatory statement, while repeating
some language for emphasis, is not intended
to negate the language referred to above un-
less expressly provided herein.
In cases where the House report, Senate re-
port, or this explanatory statement direct
the submission of a report, such report is to
be submitted to both the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations. Where this
explanatory statement refers to the Commit-
tees or the Committees on Appropriations,
unless otherwise noted, this reference is to
the House Subcommittee on Interior, Envi-
ronment, and Related Agencies and the Sen-
ate Subcommittee on Interior, Environment,
and Related Agencies.
Each department and agency funded in this
Act is directed to follow the directions set
forth in this Act and the accompanying
statement and to not reallocate resources or
reorganize activities except as provided here-
in or otherwise approved by the House and
Senate Appropriations Committees through
the reprogramming process as referenced in
this explanatory statement. This explana-
tory statement addresses only those agencies
and accounts for which there is a need for
greater explanation than provided in the Act
itself. Funding levels for appropriations by
account, program, and activity, with com-
parisons to the fiscal year 2018 enacted level
and the fiscal year 2019 budget request, can
be found in the table at the end of this divi-
sion.
Unless expressly stated otherwise, any ref-
erence to ‘‘this Act’’ or ‘‘at the end of this
statement’’ shall be treated as referring only
to the provisions of this division.
Arts and Humanities Advocacy.—The dec-
ades of arts and humanities advocacy by the
late Rep. Louise M. Slaughter is acknowl-
edged and appreciated. In her memory, the
National Endowment for the Arts and the
National Endowment for the Humanities are
encouraged to expand grant-making activi-
ties in a manner that honors her advocacy,
especially in rural and under-served areas, so
more Americans are able to benefit from the
economic, social, and educational effects of
the arts and humanities.
Delivery of Reports and Correspondence.—All
reports, correspondence, and reprogramming
requests from the agencies to the Commit-
tees shall be provided in both physical and
electronic formats.
Directives.—The Department of the Interior
and Forest Service are directed to continue
the directions included in the explanatory
statement accompanying the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115–31) relat-
ing to Vacant Grazing Allotments; State
Wildlife Data; Bighorn Sheep; Land Grants,
Acequias, and Community Ditches; and Pub-
lic Access.
Harassment-Free Workplace.—It is the ex-
pectation that all Federal employees, espe-
cially those in leadership positions, at the
agencies funded by this Act will create and
maintain harassment-free workplaces and
remind the agencies of the directives in
House Report 115–765 and Senate Report 115–
276.
Making Litigation Costs Transparent.—The
Department of the Interior, EPA, and the
Forest Service are directed to provide to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions, and to make publicly available no
later than 60 days after enactment of this
Act, detailed Equal Access to Justice Act
(EAJA) fee information as specified in the
explanatory statement accompanying Divi-
sion G of the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2017 (Public Law 115–31).
Multi-Agency Transparency.—Increasing
transparency within all agencies of the De-
partment of the Interior, the Forest Service,
and EPA is supported. These agencies are en-
couraged to disclose costs associated with
analyses required by the National Environ-
mental Policy Act.
Paper Reduction Efforts.—The Department
of the Interior, EPA, Forest Service, and In-
dian Health Service are urged to work with
the Office of Management and Budget to re-
duce printing and reproduction costs and
each agency is directed to report to the Com-
mittees within 90 days of enactment of this
Act on steps being undertaken to achieve
this goal and how much each agency expects
to save by implementing these measures.
Recreation Fee Authority.—A one-year ex-
tension of recreation fee authority for the
Department of the Interior and the Forest
Service was included in Public Law 115–245.
Twenty-first Century Conservation Service
Corps.—Consistent with the direction in
House Report 115–765 and Senate Report 115–
276, the Department of the Interior and the
Forest Service are expected to continue con-
servation partnerships with the 21st Century
Conservation Service Corps and Public Lands
Corps.
Water Rights.—The Department of the Inte-
rior and the Forest Service are reminded of
the States’ jurisdiction over water law and
expect that all applicable laws will be fol-
lowed when considering a request for a per-
mit or permit renewal.
White Nose Syndrome.—The agencies funded
by this Act are reminded of the directive in-
cluded in Senate Report 115–276.
Land and Water Conservation Fund.—The
bill includes $435,000,000 derived from the
Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF)
for programs consistent with chapter 2003 of
title 54 of the United States Code, as identi-
fied in the table below.

The agencies are expected to move forward
with all projects specifically identified and
funded through this bill; to utilize funding in
a timely manner; and to seek congressional
approval for reprogramming unobligated bal-
ances if applicable. It is expected that the
agencies will provide timely information on
project status and available balances. Agen-
cies are directed to continue their long-
standing process of identifying and
prioritizing potential Federal land acquisi-
tion projects in anticipation of program ap-
propriations as consistent with previous
years. Within 30 days of the submission of
the fiscal year 2020 budget or by March 1,
2019, whichever comes first, each agency is
directed to submit to the Committees a
prioritized list of projects for fiscal year 2020
consideration.
Increasing access to our public lands for
hunting, fishing, and other recreational ac-
tivities is important and this bill includes
funding for these projects. The agencies are
expected to work with their respective re-
gions, State offices, and/or management
units to identify potential recreation access
projects and to inform the Committees on
project selections prior to proceeding.
REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
The following are the procedures governing
reprogramming actions for programs and ac-
tivities funded in the Department of the In-
terior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act. The agencies funded in
this Act are reminded that these reprogram-
ming guidelines are in effect, and must be
complied with, until such time as the Com-
mittees modify them through bill or report
language.
Definitions.—‘‘Reprogramming,’’ as defined
in these procedures, includes the realloca-
tion of funds from one budget activity, budg-
et line-item, or program area, to another
within any appropriation funded in this Act.
In cases where either the House or Senate
Committee report displays an allocation of
an appropriation below that level, that more
detailed level shall be the basis for re-
programming.
For construction, land acquisition, and for-
est legacy accounts, a reprogramming con-
stitutes the reallocation of funds, including
unobligated balances, from one construction,
land acquisition, or forest legacy project to
another such project.
A reprogramming shall also consist of any
significant departure from the program de-
scribed in the agency’s budget justifications.
This includes proposed reorganizations, espe-
cially those of significant national or re-
gional importance, even without a change in
funding. Any change to the organization
table presented in the budget justification
shall be subject to this requirement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H819
January 18, 2019
The agencies funded by this Act have indi-
cated that they are currently working to im-
plement Executive Order 13781, a Comprehen-
sive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive
Branch, and have included in the fiscal year
2019 budget request a number of significant
reorganization proposals for the Committees’
consideration. There have been reports that
agencies funded by this Act may be weighing
additional organizational changes during the
remainder of this fiscal year. Agencies are
reminded that this bill continues long-
standing General Guidelines for Reprogram-
ming that require agencies funded by this
Act to submit reorganization proposals for
Committee review prior to their implemen-
tation. It is noted that such reprogramming
guidelines apply to proposed reorganizations,
workforce restructure, reshaping or transfer
of functions presented in the budget jus-
tifications, or bureau-wide downsizing, espe-
cially those of significant national or re-
gional importance, and include closures, con-
solidations, and relocations of offices, facili-
ties, and laboratories presented in the budg-
et justifications. In addition, no agency shall
implement any part of a reorganization that
modifies regional or State boundaries for
agencies or bureaus that were in effect as of
the date of enactment of this Act unless ap-
proved consistent with the General Guide-
lines for Reprogramming procedures speci-
fied herein. Any such reprogramming request
submitted to the Committees on Appropria-
tions shall include a description of antici-
pated benefits, including anticipated effi-
ciencies and cost-savings, as well as a de-
scription of anticipated personnel impacts
and funding changes anticipated to imple-
ment the proposal.
General Guidelines for Reprogramming.—
(a) A reprogramming should be made only
when an unforeseen situation arises, and
then only if postponement of the project or
the activity until the next appropriation
year would result in actual loss or damage.
(b) Any project or activity, which may be
deferred through reprogramming, shall not
later be accomplished by means of further
reprogramming, but instead, funds should
again be sought for the deferred project or
activity through the regular appropriations
process.
(c) Except under the most urgent situa-
tions, reprogramming should not be em-
ployed to initiate new programs or increase
allocations specifically denied or limited by
Congress, or to decrease allocations specifi-
cally increased by the Congress.
(d) Reprogramming proposals submitted to
the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations for approval shall be considered ap-
proved 30 calendar days after receipt if the
Committees have posed no objection. How-
ever, agencies will be expected to extend the
approval deadline if specifically requested by
either Committee.
Criteria and Exceptions.—A reprogramming
must be submitted to the Committees in
writing prior to implementation if it exceeds
$1,000,000 annually or results in an increase
or decrease of more than 10 percent annually
in affected programs or projects, whichever
amount is less, with the following excep-
tions:
(a) With regard to the tribal priority allo-
cations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), there
is no restriction on reprogrammings among
these programs. However, the Bureaus shall
report on all reprogrammings made during a
given fiscal year no later than 60 days after
the end of the fiscal year.
(b) With regard to the EPA, reprogram-
ming requests associated with the States and
Tribes Partnership Grants, or up to a cumu-
lative total of $30,000,000 from carryover bal-
ances among the individual program areas
delineated in the Environmental Programs
and Management account are not required.
No funds, however, shall be reallocated from
individual Geographic Programs.
Assessments.—‘‘Assessment’’ as defined in
these procedures shall refer to any charges,
reserves, or holdbacks applied to a budget
activity or budget line item for costs associ-
ated with general agency administrative
costs, overhead costs, working capital ex-
penses, or contingencies.
(a) No assessment shall be levied against
any program, budget activity, subactivity,
budget line item, or project funded by the In-
terior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act unless such assessment
and the basis therefor are presented to the
Committees on Appropriations in the budget
justifications and are subsequently approved
by the Committees. The explanation for any
assessment in the budget justification shall
show the amount of the assessment, the ac-
tivities assessed, and the purpose of the
funds.
(b) Proposed changes to estimated assess-
ments, as such estimates were presented in
annual budget justifications, shall be sub-
mitted through the reprogramming process
and shall be subject to the same dollar and
reporting criteria as any other reprogram-
ming.
(c) Each agency or bureau which utilizes
assessments shall submit an annual report to
the Committees which provides details on
the use of all funds assessed from any other
budget activity, line item, subactivity, or
project.
(d) In no case shall contingency funds or
assessments be used to finance projects and
activities disapproved or limited by Con-
gress, or to finance programs or activities
that could be foreseen and included in the
normal budget review process.
(e) New programs requested in the budget
should not be initiated before enactment of
the bill without notification to, and the ap-
proval of, the Committees on Appropria-
tions. This restriction applies to all such ac-
tions regardless of whether a formal re-
programming of funds is required to begin
the program.
Quarterly Reports.—All reprogrammings be-
tween budget activities, budget line-items,
program areas, or the more detailed activity
levels shown in this explanatory statement,
including those below the monetary thresh-
olds established above, shall be reported to
the Committees within 60 days of the end of
each quarter and shall include cumulative
totals for each budget activity, budget line
item, or construction, land acquisition, or
forest legacy project.
Land Acquisitions, Easements, and Forest
Legacy.—Lands shall not be acquired for
more than the approved appraised value (as
addressed in section 301(3) of Public Law 91–
646), unless such acquisitions are submitted
to the Committees on Appropriations for ap-
proval in compliance with these procedures.
Land Exchanges.—Land exchanges, wherein
the estimated value of the Federal lands to
be exchanged is greater than $1,000,000, shall
not be consummated until the Committees
have had a 30-day period in which to examine
the proposed exchange. In addition, the Com-
mittees shall be provided advance notifica-
tion of exchanges valued between $500,000
and $1,000,000.
Budget Structure.—The budget activity or
line item structure for any agency appro-
priation account shall not be altered without
advance approval of the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations.
TITLE I—DEPARTMENT OF THE
INTERIOR
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT
MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND RESOURCES
Bureau of Land Management Directives.—
The Bureau is reminded of the importance of
the directives included in House Report 115–
765 and Senate Report 115–276 not addressed
herein, as well as the new directives in this
explanatory statement, including the front
matter. The innovative use of technology to
improve the timeliness and accuracy of per-
mitting decisions is supported and the Bu-
reau is directed to provide a report within 90
days of enactment as directed by House Re-
port 115–765. The direction related to Chaco
Canyon included in Senate Report 115–276 is
reiterated.
Management of Lands and Resources
(MLR).—The bill provides $1,198,000,000 for
MLR. Within this amount, the Colorado
Basin Salinity Control Program is funded at
$2,000,000. Unless noted herein, the bill does
not accept the proposed funding decreases;
specific funding allocation information is lo-
cated at the end of this explanatory state-
ment.
MLR Budget Restructuring.—The Bureau’s
request to restructure several budget line
items to increase efficiency in the delivery
of programs is accepted. In fiscal year 2019,
Soil, Water and Air Management moves into
Rangeland Management. Riparian Manage-
ment moves into Wildlife and Aquatic Habi-
tat Management. Within the new Wildlife
and Aquatic Management budget line item,
the specific funding for Threatened and En-
dangered Species is maintained to ensure
transparency of funding for these activities
and it is expected these changes will improve
the Bureau’s ability to report expenditures
and performance as required by the Endan-
gered Species Act (ESA). The proposal to
consolidate Hazardous Materials and Aban-
doned Mine Lands is also accepted.
Budget Restructuring Report Requirement.—
It is expected that the restructuring will im-
prove program delivery and provide better
on-the-ground results for Burea-managed
lands and direct the Bureau to provide a re-
port with evidence of this improvement
within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
Wild Horse and Burro Management.—The
bill provides $80,555,000 for wild horse and
burro management. The financial and polit-
ical challenges of controlling wild horse and
burro populations are fully recognized and it
is noted that significant management
changes need to be made within the near fu-
ture in order to control costs, improve range
conditions, and humanely manage wild horse
and burro populations. As such, appreciation
for the Bureau’s April 26, 2018, report titled
‘‘Management Options for a Sustainable
Wild Horse and Burro Program’’ is noted, but
it is believed that additional analysis is
needed as directed by House Report 115–765.
This analysis should be provided to Congress
no later than 180 days after enactment of
this Act. The Bureau is expected to continue
evaluating its internal policies, procedures,
and regulations to reduce costs and adminis-
trative burdens, as well as researching and
developing appropriate, humane protocols
for fertility control methods, including steri-
lization, and improve its contracting for off-
range holdings. It is incumbent upon the Bu-
reau to request the funding necessary to ad-
dress this growing problem; better manage-
ment of this program now will result in
fewer dollars necessary in the future to re-
store the lands that wild horses, burros, and
other wildlife depend upon. Therefore, the
Bureau is expected to include in its fiscal
year 2020 budget request a proposal that out-
lines its proposed strategy and the funding
necessary for implementation, including an-
ticipated out-year estimates. Current prohi-
bitions on destruction and sale authority
contained in the bill are continued.

UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
The bill provides $1,292,078,000 for Resource
Management. All programs, projects, and ac-
tivities are maintained at fiscal year 2018 en-
acted levels unless otherwise specified below
or in the table at the end of this explanatory
statement. For this and all other Service ac-
counts funded in this bill, the Service is ex-
pected to comply with the instructions and
requirements at the beginning of this divi-
sion and in House Report 115–765 and Senate
Report 115–276, unless otherwise specified
below. Additional details, instructions, and
requirements follow below and in the table
at the end of this division.
Planning and Consultation.—The bill in-
cludes $3,000,000 to avoid permitting delays
and to achieve compliance with other stat-
utes, which should be apportioned in accord-
ance with workload needs nationwide rather
than by region. In addition, $4,000,000 is pro-
vided for Gulf Coast Restoration activities to
ensure that the Service has the resources
necessary to avoid delays in projects related
to the Deepwater Horizon incident. This is
consistent with the amount provided in fis-
cal year 2018. Because substantial resources
are provided to the Service for Gulf Coast
Restoration, the Service is expected to move
forward with project reviews in a timely
manner.
Lesser Prairie Chicken.—There is concern
that by listing the lesser prairie chicken
(LPC) under the ESA in spite of the unprece-
dented level of voluntary conservation ef-
forts in the habitat area, the Service signifi-
cantly reduced the incentive for stake-
holders to pursue future initiatives to pre-
serve the LPC and other species. It is noted
that if the listing of a species is viewed as in-
evitable, stakeholders lose the incentive to
invest in private, voluntary conservation ef-
forts. Therefore, the Service is directed to
collaborate with local and regional stake-
holders on improving voluntary solutions to
conserve the species with the goal of avoid-
ing the necessity of listing the LPC under
the ESA.
Recovery.—The bill includes: a $2,000,000
general program increase; $1,000,000 to imple-
ment the Prescott Grant Program as author-
ized by section 408(e) of the Marine Mammal
Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1421f–1(e)); and
$6,000,000 for Recovery Challenge matching
grants to enhance and increase partnerships
with agencies and organizations imple-
menting highest priority recovery actions as
prescribed in recovery plans, and in par-
ticular for genetically-sound breeding,
rearing, and reintroduction programs. Long-
standing partnerships, including for the
northern aplomado falcon, California condor,
and Steller’s eider, should be funded at not
less than $2,500,000, and partner contribu-
tions should be not less than their current
amounts. The remaining funds should be
dedicated to new partnerships and should re-
quire a 50:50 match, which may include in-
kind services. Unless an affected State is a
partner on the project, none of the funds
may be awarded to a project until the
project partners have consulted with such
State. The Service is expected to explore en-
tering into an agreement with the National
Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) for the
purpose of administering the program and
leveraging the funds with corporate and non-
profit contributions, in full consultation
with the Service, and to brief the Committee
within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
None of the funds may be used for indirect
costs.
Five-Year Reviews.—The Service is directed
to complete all five-year reviews within the
period required by law, and, for any deter-
mination on the basis of such review whether
a species should be delisted, downlisted, or
uplisted, promulgate an associated regula-
tion and complete the rulemaking process
prior to initiating the next status review for
such species.
Gray Wolf.—The Service’s recent commit-
ment to work closely with Federal, State,
Tribal and local partners to assess the cur-
rently listed gray wolf entities in the Lower
48 States using the best available scientific
information, and if appropriate, to publish a
proposal to revise the wolf’s status in the
Federal Register by the end of the calendar
year, is recognized.
Grizzly Bear.—The Service is directed to
work with ranchers, conservation groups,
local governments, and other local partners
to reduce conflicts between grizzly bears and
livestock. These efforts should draw upon
lessons learned with the Wolf Livestock Loss
Demonstration Program to improve con-
servation outcomes while limiting effects to
agricultural producers. Not less than 30 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, and
for a duration of not less than 90 days, the
Service and the National Park Service are
directed to re-open the public comment pe-
riod regarding the draft environmental im-
pact statement with proposed alternatives
for the restoration of grizzly bears to the
North Cascades Ecosystem. Any member of
the public in attendance at any of the associ-
ated public forums and wishing to voice their
opinion must be afforded the opportunity to
do so.
Preble’s Meadow Jumping Mouse.—The Serv-
ice is urged to address consultations and per-
mitting of public and private projects re-
lated to the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse
as one of the highest priorities.
Marbled Murrelet.—There is concern that
the draft Long Term Conservation Strategy
for the marbled murrelet is focused pri-
marily on inland nesting habitat when more
than 90 percent of the life cycle of this spe-
cies is spent in the marine environment. It is
also recognized that while the relationship
between nesting habitat and marbled
murrelet abundance is well documented,
there is comparatively little known about
factors linked to the marine environment,
including environmental conditions, prey
availability and bycatch mortality, that
may be contributing to recent population de-
clines in Washington, Oregon, and California.
Therefore, the Service is urged to partner
with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration to pursue additional studies
to determine the full range of factors linked
to the marine environment that may affect
marbled murrelet populations and to develop
a comprehensive set of recommendations to
address those factors. In addition, the Serv-
ice is directed to work collaboratively with
local communities, elected officials, and
other stakeholders in the development of the
final Long Term Conservation Strategy for
the marbled murrelet.
National Wildlife Refuge System.—The bill
includes a general program increase of
$1,000,000 for Wildlife and Habitat Manage-
ment, and the Service is encouraged to
prioritize invasive species eradication activi-
ties. The subsistence program is continued

at $2,835,000. In addition, $55,000,000 is pro-
vided for Refuge Maintenance Support.
Refuge Law Enforcement.—Adequate refuge
law enforcement is critical to protect our
natural resources, staff, and more than 53
million visitors at refuges. The Service
should request adequate funding so no refuge
is without law enforcement at any time.
Trapping on Refuges.—The Service website
includes information on trapping on refuges
at https://www.fws.gov/refuges/visitors/trap-
ping.html and has instituted signage at
those refuges. Trapping information for indi-
vidual refuges can be found on their web
pages under Resource Management.
Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.—
The Service is expected to follow the direc-
tive from fiscal year 2018 that prohibits a
caribou hunt on Kagalaska Island and efforts
to remove cattle on Chirikof and
Wosnesenski Islands in the State of Alaska.
Urban Wildlife Refuges.—Funding has been
provided to continue the Urban Wildlife Ref-
uge Partnership program at the fiscal year
2018 enacted level and to support efforts to
promote conservation in urban areas.
Green River National Wildlife Refuge.—The
Service is reminded of the direction included
in Senate Report 115–276 to establish the
Green River National Wildlife Refuge.
Rio Mora National Wildlife Refuge.—The
Service is expected to continue to support
staffing and educational programming at Rio
Mora National Wildlife Refuge and to con-
tinue dialogue with nonprofit and Tribal
partners on the Service’s plan for long-term
operations of the refuge. The Service shall
brief the Committees within 60 days of en-
actment of this Act on the status of the op-
erations plan.
Migratory Bird Management.—The bill pro-
vides $3,237,000 as requested for aviation
management, which is transferred to the
General Operations activity to more accu-
rately reflect the program’s responsibilities
across the Service.
Law Enforcement.—The bill includes
$2,000,000 for combating violations of the In-
dian Arts and Crafts Act, and the Service is
directed to brief the Committees within 60
days of enactment of this Act on the pro-
posed distribution of the funds.
International Affairs.—The bill provides
$15,816,000 for International Affairs with the
expectation that the Service will spend
above the fiscal year 2018 enacted funding
level for Wildlife Trafficking. Arctic Council
Support is continued at $550,000.
National Fish Hatchery System Operations.—
The bill provides $4,000,000 for Klamath Basin
Restoration Agreement activities, of which
at least $3,500,000 is to support rearing and
population monitoring, and of which
$3,000,000 is transferred from Habitat Assess-
ment and Restoration. None of the funds
may be used to terminate operations or to
close any facility of the National Fish
Hatchery System. None of the production
programs listed in the March 2013 National
Fish Hatchery System Strategic Hatchery
and Workforce Planning Report may be re-
duced or terminated without advance, infor-
mal consultation with affected States and
Tribes.
Aquatic Habitat and Species Conservation.—
The bill includes $6,000,000 to implement the
Delaware River Basin Conservation Act,
$9,554,000 for the subsistence program, and
$500,000 for the Lake Champlain sea lamprey
program.
Asian Carp.—The importance of the work
conducted by the Service to combat the seri-
ous threat of Asian carp is recognized and
$11,000,000 is provided for Asian carp activi-
ties, of which $2,000,000 is for contract fishing
and deterrents to extirpate Asian carp, in-
cluding grass carp. Funding should be used
to control Asian carp in the Mississippi and
Ohio River Basins, including in Kentucky
Lake, Lake Barkley, Tennessee river sys-
tems, and the Ohio River, and to prevent
Asian carp from entering and establishing in
the Great Lakes. The Service should con-
sider the utility of creating a dedicated fund-
ing source to increase the intensity and geo-
graphic scope of efforts to prevent entry into
the Great Lakes.
Cooperative Landscape Conservation.—The
bill provides $12,500,000 for Cooperative Land-
scape Conservation to support partnerships
of Federal, State, Tribal, and other organiza-
tions to develop shared conservation prior-
ities as outlined in the congressional budget
justifications provided to the Committees on
Appropriations. Any deviation from that jus-
tification must be transparent and officially
presented to the Committees on Appropria-
tions, and there must be opportunities for
public review and comment before any
changes are instituted. Funding for Gulf
Coast Restoration is continued at $1,000,000.
General Operations.—The bill includes
$5,516,000 for annual maintenance needs of
the National Conservation Training Center
(NCTC).
CONSTRUCTION
(INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
The bill provides $55,613,000 for Construc-
tion, including $39,873,000 for the backlog of
deferred maintenance principally at national
fish hatcheries and national wildlife refuges,
and rescinds $1,500,000 from prior year unob-
ligated balances, of which $300,000 was made
available by Public Law 111–8. The Service is
directed to provide a spend plan to the Com-
mittees within 120 days of enactment of this
Act for the deferred maintenance funding.
The detailed allocation of funding by activ-
ity is included in the table at the end of this
explanatory statement. For line-item con-
struction, the Service is expected to follow
the project priority list in the table below.
When a construction project is completed or
terminated and appropriated funds remain,
the Service may use those balances to re-
spond to unforeseen reconstruction, replace-
ment, or repair of facilities or equipment
damaged or destroyed by storms, floods,
fires, and similar unanticipated events.

LAND ACQUISITION
The bill provides $65,189,000 for Land Ac-
quisition. The amounts provided by this bill
for projects are shown in the table below,
listed in priority order pursuant to the
project list received for fiscal year 2019. Fur-
ther instructions are contained under the
Land and Water Conservation Fund heading
in the front of this explanatory statement.
In a time when budgetary constraints
allow for only a limited number of new land
acquisition projects, the Committees are en-
couraged by programs that leverage public/
private partnerships for land conservation
like the Highlands Conservation Act, which
has a record of more than a 2 to 1 ratio in
non-Federal matching funds. Therefore, the
bill includes $20,000,000 for the Highlands
Conservation Act Grants and the Service is
directed to work with the Highlands States
regarding priority projects for fiscal year
2019.
Revised bill language is included that pro-
vides appropriations for land acquisition and
removes unnecessary language regarding the
use of funding for Highlands Conservation
Act activities. The language included in this
bill provides sufficient authority to enable
the use of funds appropriated in the Service’s
land acquisition account to meet the re-
quirements of the Highlands Conservation
Act (P.L. 108–421).

rangers; $830,000 for increased law enforce-
ment training costs; $1,200,000 for the U.S.
Park Police helicopter replacement;
$1,300,000 for public health officers; $150,000
for unmanned aircraft services expertise;
$400,000 for Katahdin Woods and Waters;
$965,000 for new parks such as Ste. Genevieve,
Birmingham Civil Rights, and Freedom Rid-
ers; and $400,000 for Captain John Smith Na-
tional Heritage Trail to manage the new
land acquisition of Werowocomoco. The bill
also includes $500,000 for the
Semiquincentennial Commission to be ex-
pended in accordance with the United States
Semiquincentennial Commission Act of 2016.
Funding for the Roosevelt-Campobello Inter-
national Park is maintained at the fiscal
year 2018 level. Funding requested for the
agency’s reorganization efforts is provided
subject to the guidance included at the front
of this explanatory statement.
It is noted there are concerns regarding
the Service’s current inventory of hand-held
equipment supporting global positioning sys-
tems. These systems are at end-of-life and
have operating systems that are no longer
supported by the developer. The Service is
directed to brief the Committees on these
issues within 90 days of enactment of this
Act.
External Administrative Costs.—The bill in-
cludes $184,925,000 for external administra-
tive costs, including required fixed costs.
Quagga and Zebra Mussel Control.—Concern
remains about the spread of quagga and
zebra mussels in the West and $3,000,000 is
provided for continued containment, preven-
tion, and enforcement efforts, equal to the
fiscal year 2018 enacted level.
Blackstone River Valley National Historical
Park.—The bill includes requested funding
for the Blackstone River Valley National
Historical Park with the expectation that
the Service will continue to make funds
available to the local coordinating entity to
maintain staffing and capacity to assist in
management of the park as authorized in
Public Law 113–291.
Captain John Smith National Historic Trail.—
There is strong disagreement with the Serv-
ice’s decision to proceed with management
changes that affect the Service’s Chesapeake
Bay Office, the Captain John Smith Chesa-
peake National Historic Trail, and the
Werowocomoco site despite congressional
concerns. The Service is directed to produce
the report required by Senate Report 115–276
that details the Service’s legal authorities to
make the change and the steps it plans to
take to ensure that the management changes
do not weaken the Service’s commitment to
Chesapeake Bay Program partnerships.
Denali National Park Road.—There is par-
ticular concern regarding the condition of
the Denali National Park road and the Serv-
ice is directed to follow the guidance con-
tained in Senate Report 115–276 concerning
the road.
Everglades Restoration.—The progress made
toward restoration of the Everglades eco-
system is noted and support is continued for
this multi-year effort to preserve one of the
great ecological treasures of the United
States.
Oklahoma City National Memorial & Mu-
seum.—The Service’s submission of the re-
port required by the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2018 concerning Federal funds allo-
cated for the Oklahoma City Memorial is ac-
knowledged. The Service should continue to
work with all interested stakeholders to de-
termine options for providing the fully au-
thorized level of $5,000,000 for the memorial.
Point Reyes National Seashore.—It is noted
that multi-generational ranching and dairy-
ing is important both ecologically and eco-
nomically for the Point Reyes National Sea-
shore and the surrounding community.
These historic activities are also fully con-
sistent with Congress’s intent for the man-
agement of Point Reyes National Seashore.
There is awareness that the Service is con-
ducting a public process to comply with a
multi-party settlement agreement that in-
cludes the preparation of an environmental
impact statement to study the effects of
dairying and ranching on the park. The in-
clusion of alternatives that continue ranch-
ing and dairying is strongly supported, in-
cluding the Service’s Initial Proposal to
allow existing ranch families to continue
ranching and dairying operations under agri-
cultural lease/permits with 20-year terms,
and expect the Service to make every effort
to finalize a General Management Plan
Amendment that continues these historic ac-
tivities.
Trestles Historic District.—It is recognized
that Trestles Beach plays a vital role in the
training and readiness of the United States
Marine Corps and note that amendments to
the National Historic Preservation Act in-
cluded in National Park Service Centennial
Act (P.L. 114–289) modified the nomination
and approval process for the listing of Fed-
eral properties on the National Register of
Historic Places. It is also noted that the De-
partment has taken the position that it does
not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal alleg-
ing a failure of the Department of the Navy
to nominate the Trestles Historic District to
the National Register and do not expect the
Department to take any further action on
this issue.
NATIONAL RECREATION AND PRESERVATION
The bill provides $64,138,000 for national
recreation and preservation programs and in-
cludes the following additional instructions.
Heritage Partnership Program.—The bill in-
cludes $20,321,000 for the Heritage Partner-
ship Program. Individual heritage areas are
encouraged to develop plans for long-term
sufficiency. The Alliance of National Herit-
age Areas is commended, in response to con-
gressional direction, for developing an allo-
cation model that maintains core services of
more established areas while proposing addi-
tional resources to newer areas. This
progress is noted and the Service is directed
to work with heritage areas to further de-
velop consensus toward a sustainable fund-
ing distribution. As this effort continues, the
Service is expected to distribute funds in the
same manner as fiscal year 2017 with the in-
crease above the enacted level to be equally
distributed to Tier I areas or Tier 2 areas
currently receiving the minimum funding
levels of $150,000 and $300,000 respectively.
Natural Programs.—The bill maintains
funding for Natural Programs, including the
Chesapeake Gateways and Trails program
and Rivers, Trails, and Conservation, at the
fiscal year 2018 enacted level.
Cultural Programs.—The bill includes
$25,562,000 for cultural programs, an increase
of $500,000 above the enacted level. The in-
crease above the enacted level is provided
pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 4451(b) for grants to
nonprofit organizations or institutions for
the purpose of supporting programs for Na-
tive Hawaiian or Alaska Native culture and
arts development at a total program level of
$1,000,000 to be utilized consistent with the

direction outlined in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying Public Law 115–141. This
program is a good example of a multi-state,
multi-organizational collaboration as envi-
sioned under the American Indian, Alaska
Native, and Native Hawaiian Culture and Art
Development Act. Other cultural programs,
including grants to preserve and interpret
Japanese American Confinement Sites, are
continued at their fiscal year 2018 levels.
Grants Administration.—The bill does not
include the proposed transfer of grants ad-
ministration to cultural programs as pro-
posed in the request.
Native American Graves Protection and Repa-
triation Grants.—The bill supports the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatri-
ation Grant Program and maintains funding
at the fiscal year 2018 enacted level.
American Battlefield Protection Program As-
sistance Grants.—Funding is provided at the
fiscal year 2018 enacted level. The impor-
tance of public-private partnerships to main-
tain the preservation of America’s battle-
fields is recognized and the Service is urged
to give priority to projects with broad part-
ner support. The timely review and proc-
essing of grants continues to be encouraged.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION FUND
The bill provides $102,660,000 for the His-
toric Preservation Fund. Within this
amount, $49,675,000 is provided for grants to
States and $11,735,000 is provided for grants
to Tribes. The bill also includes $15,250,000
for competitive grants, of which $750,000 is
for grants to underserved communities and
$14,500,000 is for competitive grants to docu-
ment, interpret, and preserve historical sites
associated with the Civil Rights Movement.
The bill also includes $8,000,000 for competi-
tive grants to Historically Black Colleges
and Universities and $13,000,000 for the Save
America’s Treasures competitive grant pro-
gram for the preservation of nationally sig-
nificant sites, structures, and artifacts.
The bill continues $5,000,000 for preserva-
tion grants to revitalize historic properties
of national, State, and local significance in
order to restore, protect, and foster eco-
nomic development of rural villages and
downtown areas. Grants shall be made avail-
able to States, local governments, Tribes, or
community or statewide non-profit organiza-
tions for the purpose of making sub-grants
to eligible projects. Priority shall be given
to applicants with a demonstrated capacity
for allocating similar awards for preserva-
tion of such sites. To ensure that limited
funds are targeted in the most effective man-
ner, it is recommended that the Service give
priority to applicants that cap their admin-
istrative costs at no more than five percent.
The Service shall confer with the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations prior
to finalizing a grant announcement for these
funds and shall distribute grants expedi-
tiously.
CONSTRUCTION
The bill provides $364,704,000 for Construc-
tion and includes a general program increase
of $127,151,000 above the request to address
longstanding deferred maintenance and
major construction related requirements of
the Service. The Service is directed to pro-
vide, no later than 60 days after enactment
of this Act, an operating plan for the alloca-
tion of funds, including Line Item Construc-
tion projects. Requests for reprogramming
will be considered pursuant to the guidelines
included at the beginning of this explanatory
statement. No funds are provided for project
number 16, entitled ‘‘Rehabilitate Historic
Main Parade Ground Barracks’’ at the Fort
Vancouver National Historic Site. It has
been indicated that the proposed project is
intended as part of a future plan to relocate
the Service’s Pacific West Regional Office
from its current location in California. How-
ever, the budget request does not indicate
any such plans, and the Department subse-
quently implemented new regional bound-
aries for the Service as of August, 2018.
Therefore, it is premature to fund this
project during fiscal year 2019. It is further
noted with concern that the Service decided
to move the current regional office without
first consulting stakeholders and Congress.
The Service is reminded that major organi-
zational proposals like this should be dis-
closed as part of the annual budget proposal
so that Congress and the public have the op-
portunity to vet them.
Gustavus Intertie, Glacier NP.—The Service
is directed to consult regularly with the City
of Gustavus as it issues the RFP, prospectus,
and design/build contracts for the intertie at
Glacier Bay National Park.
LAND ACQUISITION AND STATE ASSISTANCE
The bill provides $168,444,000 for Land Ac-
quisition and State Assistance. The amounts

CENTENNIAL CHALLENGE
The bill provides $20,000,000 for the Centen-
nial Challenge matching grant program. The
program provides dedicated Federal funding
to leverage partnerships for signature
projects and programs for the national park
system. The Service is expected to use these
funds to address projects that have a de-
ferred maintenance component in order to
alleviate the sizeable deferred maintenance
backlog within the national park system. A
one-to-one match is required for projects to
qualify for these funds. The Service is urged
to give preference to projects that dem-
onstrate additional leveraging capacity from
its partners. From amounts in the Centen-
nial Challenge account, the Department is
encouraged to make $5,000,000 available for
critical programs and projects, pursuant to
54 U.S.C. 1011 Subchapter II, subject to terms
and conditions outlined in Title VI of Public
Law 114–289. It is noted that amounts appro-
priated for the Centennial Challenge are now
supplemented by additional mandatory reve-
nues from sales of Federal Recreational
Lands Senior Passes, as authorized by the
National Park Service Centennial Act (P.L.
114–289).

The bill provides $2,414,577,000 for Oper-
ation of Indian Programs. All programs,
projects, and activities are maintained at
fiscal year 2018 levels, except for requested
fixed cost increases and transfers, or unless

lished new regional boundaries for all of its
bureaus except for those which fall under the
leadership of the Assistant Secretary of In-
dian Affairs. Recognizing that many of the
specific details of the reorganization are still
in development, it is reiterated that the De-
partment must develop a concrete plan for
how it will reshape its essential functions,
taking into account its relationships with
the Tribes, State and local governments, pri-
vate and nonprofit partners, the public, and
the Department’s workforce. Transparency
must be an essential element of the reorga-
nization process, and the Department is ex-
pected to continue engaging external stake-
holders and conducting robust Tribal con-
sultation as it develops its expected organi-
zational changes.
The commitment of Departmental leader-
ship, through an exchange of formal letters,
to regularly consult with the Committees

TITLE II—ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION AGENCY
The bill provides $8,058,488,000 for the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA). The
bill does not support reductions proposed in
the budget request unless explicitly noted in
the explanatory statement.
Congressional Budget Justification.—The
Agency is directed to continue to include the
information requested in House Report 112–
331 and any proposals to change State alloca-
tion formulas that affect the distribution of
appropriated funds in future budget jus-
tifications.
Reprogramming and Workforce Reshaping.—
The bill does not include any of the re-
quested funds for workforce reshaping. Fur-
ther, it is expected that the Agency will not
consolidate or close any regional offices in
fiscal year 2019. The Agency is held to the re-
programming limitation of $1,000,000 and
should continue to follow the reprogram-
ming directives as provided in the front of
this explanatory statement. It is noted that
such reprogramming directives apply to pro-
posed reorganizations, workforce restruc-
ture, reshaping, transfer of functions, or
downsizing, especially those of significant
national or regional importance, and include
closures, consolidations, and relocations of
offices, facilities, and laboratories.
Further, the Agency may not use any
amount of de-obligated funds to initiate a
new program, office, or initiative, without
the prior approval of the Committees. Within
30 days of enactment of this Act, the Agency
is directed to submit to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations its annual
operating plan for fiscal year 2019, which
shall detail how the Agency plans to allocate
funds at the program project level.
Other.—It is noted that the current work-
force is below the prior year levels, there-
fore, the bill includes rescissions in the
Science and Technology and Environmental
Programs and Management accounts that
capture expected savings associated with
such changes. The Agency is directed to
apply the rescissions to reflect efficiency
savings in a manner that seeks, to the extent
practicable, to be proportional among pro-
gram project areas. Amounts provided in
this Act are sufficient to fully fund Agency
payroll estimates, and the Agency’s fiscal
year 2019 FTE target is expected to be no less
than the fiscal year 2018 levels. It is under-
stood that the Agency routinely makes fund-
ing payroll requirements a top priority and
it is expected that the Agency will continue
to do so as it executes its fiscal year 2019 ap-
propriation and applies the rescissions.
It is not expected that the Agency will un-
dertake adverse personnel actions or incen-
tive programs to comply with the rescis-
sions, nor is it expected that the Agency will
undertake large-scale adverse personnel ac-
tions or incentive programs in fiscal year
2019. As specified in the bill language, the re-
scissions shall not apply to the Geographic
Programs, the National Estuary Program,
and the National Priorities funding in the
Science and Technology and Environmental
Programs and Management accounts. The
Agency is directed to submit, as part of the
operating plan, details on the application of
such rescissions at the program project level.
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
(INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
For Science and Technology programs, the
bill provides $717,723,000 to be partially offset
by a $11,250,000 rescission for a net discre-
tionary appropriation of $706,473,000. The bill
transfers $15,496,000 from the Hazardous Sub-
stance Superfund account to this account.
The bill provides the following specific fund-
ing levels and direction:
Indoor Air and Radiation.—The bill provides
$5,997,000 and funding for the radon program

Agency is directed to allocate up to $3,000,000
to continue supporting the Partnership Re-
search as outlined in the explanatory state-
ment accompanying Public Law 115–141. This
jointly funded, multi-year government-in-
dustry research initiative should be used to
produce credible science of national scope on
such development, including review of exist-
ing exposure and health studies already un-
derway, and future research. The Agency is
encouraged to submit a report updating the
Committees on the implementation of this
partnership within 90 days of enactment of
this Act.
Research: Chemical Safety and Sustain-
ability.—The bill provides $126,930,000 for Re-
search: Chemical Safety and Sustainability.

atory statement accompanying Public Law
115–141 and House Report 115–765, EPA also is
directed to include advancement of methods
to better separately evaluate chemical haz-
ards and exposures and that take into con-
sideration harm to potentially exposed and
susceptible subpopulations.
Research: National Priorities.—The bill pro-
vides $5,000,000, which shall be used for extra-
mural research grants, independent of the
Science to Achieve Results (STAR) grant
program, to fund high-priority water quality
and availability research by not-for-profit
organizations that often partner with the
Agency. The Agency shall continue to allo-
cate the grants in accordance with the direc-
tion provided in the explanatory statement
accompanying Public Law 115–141.
Additional Guidance.—The following addi-
tional guidance is included:
Alternatives Testing.—The Agency is di-
rected to follow the guidance contained
under this heading in House Report 115–765
and to ensure that any future plans identify
and address potential barriers or limitations
on the use of alternative test methods, par-
ticularly as they relate to susceptible popu-
lations.
Enhanced Aquifer Use.—The Agency is di-
rected to continue following the guidance

contained in Senate Report 114–281 in addi-
tion to the guidance contained in House Re-
port 115–765 directing the Agency to coordi-
nate with other Federal research efforts in
this area.
Harmful Algal Blooms.—It is recognized that
there are increasing challenges many com-
munities face from harmful algal blooms
(HABs) in freshwater and coastal eco-
systems. The Agency is encouraged to fund
research grants that help promote scientific
progress towards preventing and controlling
HABs, including research to: (1) determine
the effectiveness of existing nutrient treat-
ment technologies; (2) evaluate the scale-up
of emerging nutrient treatment technologies
and develop new technologies; and (3) de-
velop best management practices to help
both rural and urban communities control
nutrients in their watersheds. Additionally,
$5,000,000 is made available to investigate
health effects from exposure to HABs and
cyanobacteria toxins and to develop methods
to monitor, characterize, and predict blooms
for early action.
STAR Grants.—The bill provides funds to
continue the Science to Achieve Results
(STAR) program, and the Agency is directed
to distribute grants consistent with fiscal
year 2018.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AND MANAGEMENT
(INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
For Environmental Programs and Manage-
ment, the bill provides $2,658,200,000 to be
partially offset by a $60,201,000 rescission for
a net discretionary appropriation of
$2,597,999,000. The bill provides the following
specific funding levels and direction:
Clean Air.—The bill provides $273,108,000 for
Clean Air. There is continued support for the
EnergySTAR program for both appliances
and buildings at the fiscal year 2018 enacted
level and the proposed shift to fee-based
funding, is not recommended. There is con-
cern that litigation over non-compliance of
voluntary EnergySTAR efficiency standards,
which can be the result of a standard that
has changed, may lead some participants to
avoid participating in the program. There is
Committees also awareness of the need for
products carrying the EnergySTAR label to
achieve the required efficiency levels to best
benefit consumers. The Agency is directed to
evaluate how the Agency may balance these
interests to ensure that the EnergySTAR
program is both fair to voluntary partici-
pants and reliable for consumers and to re-
port back to the Committees within 180 days
of the enactment of this Act. The bill also
funds both program areas related to strato-
spheric ozone at not less than the fiscal year
2018 enacted level.
Environmental Protection: National Prior-
ities.—The bill provides $15,000,000 for a com-
petitive grant program for qualified non-
profit organizations, excluding institutions
of higher education, to provide technical as-
sistance for improved water quality or safe
drinking water and adequate waste water to
small systems or individual private well
owners. The Agency shall provide $12,300,000
for Grassroots Rural and Small Community
Water Systems Assistance Act, for activities
specified under section 1442(e) of the Safe
Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j–1(e)(8)).
The Agency also is directed to provide
$1,700,000 for grants to qualified not-for-prof-
it organizations for technical assistance for
individual private well owners, with priority
given to organizations that currently pro-
vide technical and educational assistance to
individual private well owners. The Agency
is directed to provide, on a national and
multi-State regional basis, $1,000,000 for
grants to qualified organizations for the sole
purpose of providing on-site training and
technical assistance for wastewater systems.
The Agency shall require each grantee to
provide a minimum 10 percent match, in-
cluding in-kind contributions. The Agency is
directed to allocate funds to grantees within
180 days of enactment of this Act.
Concern remains that the Agency made a
decision to put out a multi-year Request for
Applications for fiscal year 2017 and 2018
without the expressed approval of the Com-
mittees. The Agency is directed to obtain ap-
proval from the Committees for any similar
activity in the future.
Geographic Programs.—The bill provides
$456,958,000, as described in the table at the
end of this division, and includes the fol-
lowing direction:

ban, and agricultural lands.
Gulf of Mexico.—The bill provides $14,542,000
for the Gulf of Mexico Geographic Program
where hypoxia is a growing cause for con-
cern. The Agency is directed to coordinate
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the
Gulf States, and State, local, and private
partners to leverage additional resources for
conservation projects on working lands with-
in the Gulf Region and Mississippi River
Basin. The Agency is directed to distribute
funds in the same manner as fiscal year 2018.
Lake Champlain.—The bill provides
$11,000,000 for the Lake Champlain program.
From within the amount provided, $4,399,000

necessary to implement the EPA’s 2016 Phos-
phorus Total Maximum Daily Load Plan for
Lake Champlain for projects and work iden-
tified in the State implementation plan.
Puget Sound.—The bill provides $28,000,000.
The Agency shall follow the direction under

tains funding to support the Northwest For-
est program at not less than the fiscal year
2018 funding level.

mit to the Committees on Appropriations
and Environment and Public Works of the
Senate and the Committees on Appropria-
tions and Energy and Commerce of the
House of Representatives a report explaining
why the Agency did not implement the rec-
ommendation, as well as identifying specific
actions the Agency is implementing to ad-
dress the concerns raised in the report.
Lead and Other Hazardous Materials.—The
Agency is directed to follow directives in-
cluded in Senate Report 115–276 regarding

tory surrounding the CWA indicates that
Congress intended for groundwater pollution
to be regulated through the CWA’s nonpoint
source program and other Federal and State
laws.
Small Refinery Relief.—The directive con-
tained in Senate Report 114–281 related to
small refinery relief is continued. The Agen-

ernization.—The bill includes language that
will enable EPA to collect and spend new
fees to conduct additional chemical reviews,
consistent with TSCA modernization legisla-
tion. Those fees are expected to be $27,000,000
per year once the program is fully imple-
mented. The Congressional Budget Office es-
timates that in fiscal year 2019 fee collec-
tions will begin several months after the be-
ginning of the fiscal year and will total
$5,000,000.

opment of a long-term, multi-year plan to
guide needed investments in buildings, facili-
ties, transportation systems, and other in-
frastructure by December 30, 2018. There is
interest in reviewing the plan and it is ex-
pected that the Service will utilize the plan
in formulating future budget requests. The
annual budget justification documents
should detail the amounts requested for new
construction, maintenance, decommis-
sioning, and other activities for the Facili-
ties, Roads and Trails programs.

INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES
The bill provides a total of $5,804,223,000 for
the Indian Health Service (IHS), of which
$4,103,190,000 is for the Services account as
detailed below. All programs, projects, and
activities are maintained at fiscal year 2018
enacted levels unless otherwise specified
below. The Service is expected to comply
with the instructions and requirements at
the beginning of this division and in House
Report 115–765 and Senate Report 115–276, un-
less otherwise specified below. Additional de-
tails, instructions, and requirements follow
below and in the table at the end of this divi-
sion.
Staffing for New Facilities.—The bill in-
cludes $103,931,000 for staffing newly opened
health facilities, which is the full amount
based upon updated estimates provided to
the Committees. Funds for the staffing of
new facilities are limited to facilities funded
through the Health Care Facilities Construc-
tion Priority System or the Joint Venture
Construction Program that have opened in
fiscal year 2018 or will open in fiscal year
2019. None of these funds may be allocated to
a facility until such facility has achieved
beneficial occupancy status.
Hospitals and Health Clinics.—The bill pro-
vides $2,147,343,000 for hospitals and health
clinics, and includes $36,000,000 for operations
and maintenance of village built and tribally
leased clinics, and $4,000,000 for domestic vio-
lence prevention. There is awareness of ongo-
ing litigation between the Cherokee Nation
and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee
Indians. The bill is neutral on this matter
and provides the requested $1,969,000 for new
Tribes. The agency is expected to consult
with both parties before disbursing funds.
Dental Health.—The bill provides
$204,672,000 for dental health and includes the
requested transfer of $800,000 from direct op-
erations. The Service is directed to backfill
vacant dental health positions in head-
quarters.

includes $6,946,000 to continue behavioral
health integration and $3,600,000 to continue

vides $245,566,000 for alcohol and substance

$1,800,000 for the youth pilot project; and
$2,000,000 to fund essential detoxification and
related services provided by the Service’s
public and private partners to IHS bene-
ficiaries. The Service is expected to continue
its partnership with the Na’ Nizhoozhi Cen-
ter in Gallup, New Mexico, as directed by the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, and
to distribute funds provided for detoxifica-
tion services in the same manner as in fiscal
year 2017. It is believed that Service and
Tribally operated facility participation in
state prescription drug monitoring programs
can help to combat the abuse of drugs like
opioids and direct the agency to provide the
report required by Senate Report 115–276 on
this issue.
Opioid Grants.—To better combat the
opioid epidemic, the bill includes an increase
of $10,000,000 and instruct the Service, in co-
ordination with the Assistant Secretary for
Mental Health and Substance Use, to use the
additional funds provided above the fiscal
year 2018 level to create a Special Behavioral
Health Pilot Program modeled after the Spe-
cial Diabetes Program for Indians. This Spe-
cial Behavioral Health Pilot Program for In-
dians shall be developed after appropriate
Tribal consultation and should support the
development, documentation, and sharing of
more locally-designed and culturally appro-
priate prevention, treatment, and aftercare
services for mental health and substance use
disorders in Tribal and urban Indian commu-
nities. The Director of the Indian Health
Service, in coordination with the Assistant
Secretary for Mental Health and Substance
Use, shall award grants for providing serv-
ices, and provide technical assistance to
grantees under this section to collect and
evaluate performance of the program.
Purchased/Referred Care.—It is recognized
that there is a strong need for Purchased/Re-
ferred Care funding across Indian Country,
particularly in areas that lack Indian Health
Service facilities. The Service’s continued
pro rata allocation of any increases provided
for population growth and inflation, regard-
less of any population growth or cost-of-liv-
ing differences among areas, as documented
by the Government Accountability Office
(GAO–12–466) is further recognized. Con-
sistent with GAO recommendations, the
Service is encouraged to consider allocating
any future budget increases using the alloca-
tion formula established in consultation
with the Tribes.
Urban Indian Health.—The bill provides
$51,315,000 for urban Indian health and in-
cludes a $2,000,000 general program increase.
The Service is expected to continue to in-
clude current services estimates for urban
Indian health in future budget requests.
Indian Health Professions.—The bill pro-
vides $57,363,000 for Indian health professions
and includes bill language allowing up to
$44,000,000 for the loan repayment program.
The bill provides an increase of $195,000 to
expand the Indians into Medicine program to
four sites. Funding for the Quentin N. Bur-
dick American Indians into Nursing Program
and the American Indians into Psychology
Program is continued at no less than the fis-
cal year 2018 enacted levels.
Maternal and Child Health.—The hiring of a
national maternal/child health coordinator
as a top priority for the Office of Clinical and
Preventive Services and await the report re-
quired in House Report 115–765 is supported.
CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS
The bill continues language from fiscal
year 2018 establishing an indefinite appro-
priation for contract support costs estimated
to be $822,227,000, which is equal to the re-
quest. By retaining an indefinite appropria-
tion for this account, additional funds may
be provided by the agency if its budget esti-
mate proves to be lower than necessary to
meet the legal obligation to pay the full
amount due to Tribes. It is believed that
fully funding these costs will ensure Tribes
have the necessary resources they need to
deliver program services efficiently and ef-
fectively.
INDIAN HEALTH FACILITIES
The bill provides $878,806,000 for Indian
Health Facilities. All programs, projects,
and activities are maintained at fiscal year
2018 enacted levels unless otherwise specified
below.
Staffing for New Facilities.—The bill in-
cludes $11,302,000 for staffing newly opened
health facilities, which is the full amount
based upon updated estimates provided to
the Committees. The stipulations included
in the ‘‘Indian Health Services’’ account re-
garding the allocation of funds pertain to
this account as well.
Health Care Facilities.—There is continued
dedication to providing access to health care
for IHS patients across the system. IHS is
expected to aggressively work down the cur-
rent Health Facilities Construction Priority
System list. In addition, within 180 days of
enactment of this Act, the Service is di-
rected to publish the gap analysis directed
by House Report 115–238 so that the Commit-
tees can more accurately determine facili-
ties needs across the IHS system.
Indian Health Care Improvement Act Dem-
onstration Authorities.—The Service is di-
rected to provide a report within 180 days of
enactment of this Act identifying the cri-
teria the agency will use for ranking projects
funded through demonstration authorities
provided in the most recent reauthorization
of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act
should funds become available in future fis-
cal years. The Service is encouraged to con-
sider as one factor the location of existing or
proposed facilities and the distance that pa-
tients must travel to receive the same or
similar services.
Health Facilities Requirements in Alaska.—
The Service is directed to work with appro-
priate Tribal organizations and submit a re-
port to the Committees within 180 days of
this Act that includes an assessment of up-
dated facilities needs in the State of Alaska
as well as recommendations for alternative
financing options which could address the
need for additional health care facilities
space suitable to meet the current and fu-
ture health care needs of IHS beneficiaries in
the State.
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL
HEALTH SCIENCES
The bill provides $79,000,000 for the Na-
tional Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences. This includes an increase of
$1,500,000 for the Superfund Research Pro-
gram and $151,000 for the Worker Training

ating the need for a public health assess-
ment. The Agency is encouraged to maintain
professional and scientific independence re-
garding its selection of sites for assessment
while following its statutory mandate to
work with communities.
Areas with High Incidence of Pediatric Can-
cer.—Within 180 days of enactment, ATSDR,
in consultation with other components of
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices (HHS), is directed to submit to the Sen-
ate Appropriations and Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions Committees and House
Appropriations and Energy and Commerce
Committees a report that provides details on
the geographic variation in pediatric cancer
incidence in the United States. Such report
must include: (1) the types of pediatric can-
cer within each of the 10 States with the
highest age-adjusted incidence rate of cancer
among persons less than 20 years old; (2) geo-
graphic distribution of pediatric cancer
types within each such State, in accordance
with Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion guidelines; and (3) an update on current
activities related to pediatric cancer, includ-
ing with respect to carrying out section
399V–6 of the Public Health Service Act (42
U.S.C. 280g–17). In addition, HHS is encour-
aged to conduct public outreach, in collabo-
ration with State departments of health,
particularly in the 10 States with the highest
age-adjusted incidence rate of cancer among
persons aged less than 20 years old, to im-
prove awareness by residents, clinicians, and
others, as appropriate, of possible contrib-
uting factors to pediatric cancer, including
environmental exposures, in a manner that
is complementary of, and does not conflict
with, ongoing pediatric cancer-related ac-
tivities supported by HHS. Finally, the Sec-
retary of HHS is directed to ensure that all
information with respect to patients that is
contained in the reports under this section is
de-identified and protects personal privacy
of such patients in accordance with applica-
ble Federal and State privacy law.

In implementing this bill, Federal depart-
ments, agencies, commissions, and other en-
tities are directed to comply with the direc-
tives, reporting requirements, and instruc-
tions contained in H. Rept. 115–829 (House re-
port) accompanying H.R. 6385 (House bill)
and S. Rept. 115–282 (Senate report) accom-
panying S. 3108 (Senate bill) as though stated
in this explanatory statement, unless specifi-
cally directed to the contrary.
This explanatory statement, while repeat-
ing some House and Senate report language
for emphasis or clarification, does not ne-
gate language in such reports unless ex-
pressly provided herein. Language expressing
an opinion or making an observation in the
House or Senate reports represents the view
of the respective committee unless specifi-
cally endorsed in this explanatory state-
ment. In cases in which the House and Sen-
ate reports provide contradictory directives
or contradictory instructions that are not
addressed in this explanatory statement,
such directives or instructions are negated.
Reports required to be submitted pursuant
to the Act, including reports required by this
explanatory statement and the House and
Senate reports, may not be consolidated to
include responses to multiple requirements
in a single report, except following consulta-
tion with the Committees on Appropriations.
In lieu of the tables and allocations of
funding contained in the House and Senate
reports, the tables and such allocations con-
tained in this explanatory statement shall
guide departments, agencies, commissions,
and other entities when allocating funds.
Section 7019 of the Act requires that
amounts designated in the respective tables
referenced in this explanatory statement for
funds appropriated in titles III through V,
including tables in title VII, shall be made
available in such designated amounts, unless
otherwise provided for in the Act, and shall
be the basis of the report required by section
653(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961
(FAA) (the 653(a) report), where applicable.
The section also includes limited authority
to deviate from such specified amounts and
continues language similar to prior years in-
cluding exceptions to the application of the
requirements of such section for amounts
designated in tables included in this explana-
tory statement for International Military
Education and Training, Global Health Pro-
grams, and Economic Support Fund/Global
Programs, funds for which the initial period
of availability has expired, amounts des-
ignated by the Act as minimum funding re-
quirements, and funds made available for a
country pursuant to sections 7043(c), 7047(d),
and 7071(b) of the Act.
Proposed deviations from tables in titles I
and II in this explanatory statement are sub-
ject to the regular notification procedures of
the Committees on Appropriations, unless an
exception or deviation authority is specifi-
cally provided herein.
For the purposes of this explanatory state-
ment, the term ‘‘prior Acts’’ means prior
Acts making appropriations for the Depart-
ment of State, foreign operations, and re-
lated programs. In addition, any reference to
‘‘division K of Public Law 115–141’’ means the
Department of State, Foreign Operations,
and Related Programs Appropriations Act,
2018, and any reference to ‘‘division J of Pub-
lic Law 115–31’’ means the Department of
State, Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams Appropriations Act, 2017.
For purposes of the Act and explanatory
statement, the term ‘‘regular notification
procedures of the Committees on Appropria-
tions’’ means such Committees are notified
not less than 15 days in advance of the obli-
gation of funds. The Secretary of State and
USAID Administrator are directed to submit
notifications for the obligation of funds
made available by the Act and prior Acts not
later than 60 days prior to the expiration of
such funds.
Congressional notifications submitted by
the Secretary of State and USAID Adminis-
trator for funds that are being reallocated
prior to initial obligation, reprogrammed, or
reobligated after deobligation, shall, to the
maximum extent practicable, contain de-
tailed information about the sources of the
funds and why such funds are no longer in-
tended to be used as previously justified.
For purposes of the Act, the term ‘‘prior
consultation’’ means a pre-decisional en-
gagement between a relevant Federal agency
and the Committees on Appropriations dur-
ing which the Committees are provided a
meaningful opportunity to provide facts and
opinions to inform: (1) the use of funds; (2)
the development, content, or conduct of a
program or activity; or (3) a decision to be
taken. Direction to consult with the ‘‘Com-
mittee’’ in either the House or Senate re-
ports shall mean to consult with the Com-
mittees on Appropriations.
In the Act, the term ‘‘stabilization assist-
ance’’ has the same meaning as defined by
the Stabilization Assistance Review in ‘‘A
Framework for Maximizing the Effectiveness
of U.S. Government Efforts to Stabilize Con-
flict-Affected Areas, 2018.’’
As in prior fiscal years, additional funding
designated as Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT)
pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emer-
gency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA)
is contained in title VIII of the Act. Such
funds are intended to address the extraor-
dinary costs of operations and assistance in
countries in conflict and areas of instability
and violence, particularly in the Middle
East, South Asia, and Africa; security, sta-
bilization, and peacekeeping programs; hu-
manitarian activities; and counterterrorism
and counterinsurgency efforts.
The Secretary of State shall comply with

scribed.

plement a public-private partnerships pro-
gram to accelerate a coherent approach to
development in fragile states and states
threatened or adversely impacted by eco-
nomic and political instability or violent ex-
tremism, which shall be in addition to other
bilateral assistance for such states.
In implementing such public-private part-
nership program, the Secretary of State and
the USAID Administrator shall: (1) ensure
the program is fully integrated and con-
sistent with the development strategy for re-
cipient countries; (2) require the central gov-
ernment to commit to implementation of
such program in a transparent and account-
able manner; (3) prioritize the participation
of local organizations in participating as im-
plementers and provide for the training and
mentoring of such organizations; and (4) co-
ordinate and ensure complementarity with
other bilateral and regional programs funded
by the Act and prior Acts, and with other de-
velopment and security programs conducted
by other Federal agencies and international
donors.
Prior to the obligation of funds made
available by the Act for such program, the
Secretary of State and USAID Administrator
shall jointly submit a report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations detailing: (1) the
states potentially eligible for the program;
(2) the requirements of the central govern-
ments for participation in the program and
program conditionality, if any; and (3)
benchmarks to measure the effectiveness of
such program.

USAID’s Regional Development Mission for

Appropriations on the design and implemen-
tation of programs to counter violent extre-
mism in Asia, including within, and among,
Buddhist communities in Burma, Cambodia,
Laos, Sri Lanka, Tibet, Thailand, and Viet-
nam.
Section 7072. United Nations Population Fund
(unchanged)
Section 7073. Reorganization and Information
Technology (modified)
Funds made available by the Act are pro-
vided in the amounts necessary for, and for
the purposes of, maintaining the on-board
Foreign Service and Civil Service staff levels
of the Department of State and USAID at
not less than the levels as of December 31,
2017. This assumes such levels reflect min-
imum necessary hiring, and the Secretary of
State and USAID Administrator should work
with the Committees on Appropriations to
increase hiring above such levels, as appro-
priate. The explanatory statement accom-
panying division K of Public Law 115–141 con-
tains a similar directive, with which the De-
partment of State and USAID have not com-
plied.
The bill assumes sufficient funding for in-
troductory classes for the Department of
State Foreign Service (A–100 classes) at the
pre-fiscal year 2017 rate, and the Secretary of
State shall continue such classes in such
manner. The Secretary shall report to the
appropriate congressional committees not
later than 45 days after enactment of the Act
on the schedule for the A–100 classes.
Pursuant to subsection (a)(1), the notifica-
tion shall include: (1) a detailed description
of, and justification for, the proposed action,
including any policies or procedures cur-
rently or expected to be used to implement
Executive Order 13781; (2) the current organi-
zational chart, showing the operating units
of the respective department, agency or or-
ganization and a brief description of each op-
erating unit; the number of employees for
each operating unit; the proposed new orga-
nizational chart with descriptions of each
new operating unit; and the number of em-
ployees once the proposed reorganization is
complete; (3) an assessment of how the pro-
posed action will improve the efficiency, ef-
fectiveness, performance, and accountability
(including through modernizing information
technology platforms and streamlining ad-
ministrative functions) of the department,
agency, or organization; (4) an analysis of
the impact of any such change on the ability
to advance the national interest of the
United States through diplomacy and devel-
opment, and to conduct adequate monitoring
and oversight of foreign assistance programs,
and any legislative change necessary to im-
plement such proposals; (5) the estimated
cost, including for design, implementation,
facilities, and personnel for fiscal years 2019
and 2020; (6) the estimated timeline to com-
plete the proposed action; and (7) an assess-
ment of any cost savings and efficiencies
achieved through implementation of each
element of the proposed action.
The USAID Administrator shall update, as
appropriate and in writing, the Committees
on Appropriations if implementing the rec-
ommendations and conclusions of the For-
eign Assistance Review (FAR) would affect
the information or proposed changes in
USAID ‘‘Reorg CNs #1–9’’.
In addition, not later than 60 days after
completion of the FAR, the Secretary of
State and USAID Administrator shall sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Appro-
priations detailing the anticipated impact of
the FAR on Department of State and USAID
programs and operations in future fiscal year
budget requests.
Pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(A), the report
shall include the following information on a
quarterly basis: (1) actual obligations to date
for all implementation costs associated with
‘‘Reorg CNs #1–9’’ by the categories detailed
in USAID’s response to the Committees on
Appropriations on October 30, 2018, to in-
clude the salaries and benefits of United
States Direct Hire employees working di-
rectly on implementation of each reorga-
nization and the source of such funding; (2) a
project status and projected timeline for
each of the reorganizations based on the
milestones and timelines provided to the
Committees on Appropriations on October
30, 2018; and (3) actual and anticipated
United States Direct Hire workforce level
changes by bureau and operating unit as a
result of the reorganizations, including staff-
ing shifts between functions.
Not later than 60 days after completion of
the zero-based budgeting and personnel staff-
ing exercise being conducted in support of
USAID’s transformation initiative, the
USAID Administrator shall submit to the
Committees on Appropriations a detailed re-
port that includes: (1) a summary of the op-
erating and personnel costs, including such
costs that are paid from program funds, of
each operating unit, overseas mission, or
overseas office prior to transformation; (2)
an estimate of such costs for each operating
unit, overseas mission, or overseas office
after transformation; and (3) a comparison of
the total operating cost of the Agency prior
to, and after, transformation detailed by
Overseas Missions costs, Washington Sup-
port costs, and Central Support costs, and
their subcategories.
The USAID Administrator shall regularly
consult with the appropriate congressional
committees and development stakeholders
on efforts to transition nations from assist-
ance recipients to enduring diplomatic, eco-
nomic, and security partners, which shall in-
clude any changes to the guiding principles
and metrics to support such efforts, and on
other matters related to the implementation
plan required by section 7069(b) of division K
of Public Law 115–141.
Not later than 180 days after enactment of
the Act, the Secretary of State and USAID
Administrator shall submit to the appro-
priate congressional committees an updated
implementation plan on country transitions
from assistance, as required by section
7069(b)(2) of division K of Public Law 115–141.
The waiver authority and notification re-
quirement of section 7015(e) of this Act shall

this subsection.

against itself is brought to desolation;
and every city or house divided against
itself shall not stand.’’ Lord, give our

GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise
today to discuss where we stand as a
nation and as a Senate on day 28 of the
longest shutdown in the history of the
United States. Following my com-
ments, I will offer by UC to pull one of
the House bills up, and I understand
the Senator from Oklahoma will be
here to respond to that.
We were not scheduled to be in ses-
sion today. We were supposed to ad-
journ yesterday and then reconvene on
Monday, January 28, but I objected to
the adjournment, just as I did last
weekend, because our government is
closed. So we will be in today and to-
morrow, off Sunday and Monday in
honor of Martin Luther King, Jr., and
then return on Tuesday, January 22.
I offer a partial apology to my col-
leagues and to our professional Senate
staff for any inconvenience they expe-
rience because we will be in session
during a time when there had been a
scheduled recess. I have never objected
to the normal weekly adjournment be-
fore last week, and I cannot imagine
doing so under normal circumstances.
But my apology is only partial because
the inconvenience experienced by any-
one in this Chamber—Senate or profes-
sional staff—pales in comparison to the
pain that this shutdown inflicts upon
workers who are not getting paid, citi-
zens who are not being served, and a
nation whose reputation is being dam-
aged. We are made to look like a laugh-
ing stock by this needless shutdown,
and the enemies of America around the
world are enjoying this immensely,
just as our allies are deeply worried
about us.
Despite what some believe and de-
spite the impression that some may
draw from recent history in the article
I branch, I do not believe the shut-
tering of the government of the United
States is a normal circumstance, and I,
for one, will do anything I can to fight
against the normalization of the status
we find ourselves in today. That is why
I am here today. That is why I will be
here tomorrow. That is why I will be
here all next week. If our government
is closed, I will be here trying to open
it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S300 January 18, 2019
I am only one Senator, and I lack the
power to compel anyone else to be here
with me other than the Presiding Offi-
cer. I lack the power to force a floor
vote to reopen government. I lack the
power to call up any legislative matter
for a vote, save the two House bills
that we have agreed may be called up
pursuant to the UC rules.
I do have the power to talk every day
with my colleagues and the adminis-
tration officials to encourage the re-
opening of our government, and I do
have the power to stand on the floor
and describe the circumstances of my
constituents and all Americans who
are being needlessly hurt.
Only a few will hear me as I describe
their pain, but describe it I will, and
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD will record
for all history their stories. If you
want me to share your story in the
days to come as I take the floor, please
reach out to my office at
kaine.senate.gov, where you will see a
way to share your shutdown story, and
I will try to share as many of these as
I can in the days to come.
Today, before I offer the UC on the
homeland security short-term bill, I
want to do two things. I want first to
elaborate on a point I made briefly yes-
terday about the cardinal illogic of this
shutdown, and, second, I want to share
stories just from meetings that I had
yesterday with affected Federal em-
ployees and veterans.
The cardinal illogic of this shutdown
has at least three levels. The cause of
the shutdown is clear. President Trump
does not believe $1.3 billion for border
security funding contained in a bipar-
tisan appropriation bill is sufficient.
He says ‘‘I want more,’’ and he is will-
ing to shut down massive sections of
the American government to get more.
President Trump is not only willing to
do this; he says that he is proud to do
this, even for weeks and months, and
he invited cameras into a meeting with
congressional leaders and told America
that he is the sole responsible party for
it.
The first level of illogic to the shut-
down is this: Most of the employees
and citizens affected by the shutdown
have absolutely nothing—nothing—to
do with the debate over the right ap-
propriations level for border security.
What does the debate about border se-
curity have to do with the food stamp
program and those who work for it?
What does it have to do with the Na-
tional Park Service? What does it have
to do with the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, with the Internal Rev-
enue Service, with the chemical safety
board, with national forests, with men-
tal health services, domestic violence
programs funded through Department
of Justice grants, or with affordable
housing programs administered by
HUD? Hundreds of thousands of work-
ers and millions of citizens who are
served by the affected Agencies are
being punished—locked out of their
jobs, deprived of paychecks, turned
away from services because the Presi-
dent believes that if he punishes
enough people, even those unconnected
with the legitimate issue at hand, he
will get what he wants. This is tyrant
behavior, not Presidential behavior.
The illogic of this form of punish-
ment struck me most vividly yester-
day, when I moved to reopen these af-
fected Agencies and Leader MCCONNELL
objected to my UC request. One of the
Agencies covered by my UC request
was the Executive Office of the Presi-
dent of the United States. At the White
House, many of the President’s own
chosen staff are furloughed or they are
working without pay during the shut-
down, so I stood on the floor as a Dem-
ocrat to ask that the President’s own
staff be allowed to return to work to
serve him, to serve the country, and to
be paid.
The majority leader, having pre-
viously described his motivation as
trying to support the President, stood
and objected to the motion that would
have returned the President’s own staff
to work. You can’t make this stuff up.
The second level of illogic of this
shutdown concerns the core of the pol-
icy dispute: the appropriations level for
border security. The UC request that I
will offer in a few minutes deals with
that part of the dispute that is pending
before the body. I will offer in a few
minutes the UC on the House bill that
would reopen for a short term the
Homeland Security Agencies that pro-
vide security while Congress tries to
find a bipartisan deal that can pass
both Houses and earn the President’s
signature, and Senate Republicans,
again, in a few minutes—at the request
of President Trump, who does not yet
want this to happen—will object to
that request as well.
If the issue in dispute is border secu-
rity or, as President Trump often says,
‘‘the safety and security of the Amer-
ican people’’—he says that in speeches;
he says in tweets that is the issue—
then why punish the very people who
are providing that safety and security?
How does it help promote safety and
security to not pay the very Border Pa-
trol agents charged with protecting the
border? How does it promote safety and
security to not pay FBI agents, DEA
agents, Federal prosecutors, ATF
agents, and U.S. marshals? How does it
promote safety and security to not pay
members of the Coast Guard, who help
interdict drugs and also rescue Ameri-
cans endangered at sea? How does it
promote safety and security to not pay
TSA agents, who keep dangerous peo-
ple off planes, or air traffic controllers,
who keep air traffic safety safely co-
ordinated in American skies?
The President has proudly taken pay-
checks away from the very profes-
sionals whom we ask to guard the safe-
ty and security of the American public
every day, and in doing so, he has made
our citizens and our country less safe
and less secure.
The third level of illogic is a con-
sequence of actions that were taken by
Congress and the President in the last
week. For this, I want to offer thanks
to my colleagues. I was able, through
use of my adjournment objection last
week, to negotiate a successful vote on
a bill guaranteeing backpay to all
workers affected by this or any future
shutdown. I appreciate the cooperation
of all my Senate colleagues—the ma-
jority leader, the minority leader and
others and the House—in this effort
and appreciate that President Trump
signed the bill in the last few days.
Having guaranteed backpay, we are
now faced with an unusual question
about continuing the shutdown. Now
that we know the Federal Treasury
will stroke checks to all affected work-
ers to make them whole at least for the
salary they have lost, wouldn’t we
rather have them at work serving their
fellow Americans rather than locked
out of their offices and unable to serve
them? What sense does it make to
guarantee payment or prohibit them
from doing the work for which they are
paid? These workers want to go back to
work because they want to serve their
fellow citizens.
That brings me to the second part of
my remarks before I offer the UC. I had
three meetings yesterday with large
groups of Virginians where I listened to
them talk about the shutdown. Two of
the meetings were actually specifically
designed to hear from Federal employ-
ees about the shutdown. One was an an-
nual coffee that Senator WARNER and I
have for veterans to celebrate their
service to the country, and as they
were waiting in line and taking pic-
tures, they were talking to us a lot
about the shutdown.
In these three instances, I heard an
awful lot. Just as I will share stories
next week, let me now summarize a few
of the things I heard from those I
interacted with yesterday and tell you
about them.
The mother of a newborn, 6 months
old, who works as an air traffic con-
troller and can’t afford to pay her
babysitter, is working but getting no
salary. She started to cry because, she
said: I have to go to work and can’t pay
a babysitter. So the only thing I can do
is—I am not calling in sick. The only
thing I can do is send my baby to my
mother who lives in another State.
She started to cry.
My baby is 6 months old. I have never
been away from my baby for more than
8 hours. I don’t want to be away from
my child. How long is it going to go
on? I may be away from my child for
weeks.
She teared up as she told us about
this.
There was a Federal employee who
said: ‘‘I signed up to serve Americans
but didn’t realize that I was being
drafted into a political war I had no in-
terest in being part of,’’ a war in which
Federal employees are used as hos-
tages.
There was a young married couple,
both Federal employees, working with-
out pay, holding their newborn, a tiny
baby in their arms, and tearing up as

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S301
January 18, 2019
they talked about their uncertainty
over paying their mortgage and other
bills.
There was a furloughed Federal em-
ployee whose wife is a disabled veteran
with PTSD but is postponing her men-
tal health appointments because of her
inability to pay copays or pay for
medications.
The two Federal-employee couple
whose 4- and 6-year-old children, hear-
ing in the background the news on TV
and hearing their parents’ anxious dis-
cussions at night, came up to them the
day after Christmas, each holding their
piggy banks and giving them to their
parents, saying: Maybe you guys need
these piggy banks now more than we
do.
There was a veteran who has success-
fully created an entrepreneurial gov-
ernment contracting business and has
hundreds of employees who are out of
work because of the shutdown.
All of these people express this: their
love for public service, their desire to
continue public service, and their per-
sonal pain at feeling disrespected just
because they want to provide public
service.
A repeated concern expressed by so
many of them about the backlog that
is on their desks—they think they will
be back at some point, but it was real-
ly interesting: Sitting on my desk was
this piece of work that I really wanted
to get done and how much more is
going to be there? It will be hard to
serve people, and they will be mad be-
cause the backlog is so big.
They are having anxiety about not
being able to serve people well because
the backlog will grow during the 4
weeks of the shutdown.
Then, a deep concern shared by so
many: Why would any young person
want to go into public service? Why
would any young person, with a heart
for public service, want to do that as a
Federal employee?
Before I offer the UC—I see my col-
league from Oklahoma is here—I want
to tell one last story that, for some
reason, of all the ones yesterday, this
is the one that stuck with me. There
were others that might have been more
dire, but this one stuck with me be-
cause I think it exemplifies a spirit I
see in so many of our Federal workers.
There was an employee of the Na-
tional Park Service who has been with
the park service for about 10 years, and
his job is to physically maintain the
space around the White House:
groundskeeping, trash removal, any-
thing, as he says, he can do to make
those grounds around the White House
look really fantastic. He described why
he loves his job, and it wasn’t sort of
the tasks that he does.
He said: I want schoolchildren vis-
iting Washington, DC, and I want
international visitors visiting Wash-
ington, DC, when they come to the
White House, to be able to look at this
and see it and feel impressed with the
United States of America. It makes me
feel proud when I see the reaction on
people’s faces as they are there in front
of the White House.
That is how he described his work.
He is furloughed and without pay, so
he is home. There are news accounts
about trash overflowing at national
parks and things like that, and that
kind of causes him angst, obviously. He
is angry about the situation. He didn’t
mince any words with me as he de-
scribed it.
Last Sunday morning he got a call. It
was: Hey, we need you to come shovel
snow.
We had snow last weekend in DC. We
had a lot of snow, 10 inches of snow.
You have to come in and shovel
snow. You are not being paid. I know
you feel the disrespect of being fur-
loughed, and we are not going to be
able to pay you for shoveling snow, but
can you come in and shovel snow on
Sunday so that at least the walkways
are clear in front of the White House?
He said: Boy, I really had something
I wanted to say on that call. I wanted
to say no, but then I thought about
this: What if somebody because of the
snow, like a kid, falls and breaks their
leg or there is an accident or some-
thing because the sidewalks aren’t
clear or there is ice that causes some
problem?
He started to think about the people
he cares about that he wants to be im-
pressed by the White House because he
wants them to be impressed by the
country, and he said: Well, I guess I
better go shovel the snow.
I kid you not. We were having this
conversation about 11:45 yesterday
morning, and some of you had seen
there is a weather report this weekend
that is a little bit iffy in DC. During
the middle of his telling me his story,
his phone rang, and he looked at it and
said: Yeah, that is my boss. I am not
going to answer it. I know why he is
calling.
I said: Did you just time this for a
stage effect because you knew you were
meeting with me right now? Did you
tell him not to call at 10:30 but to call
at 11:30?
He said: No, I know what the call is
about. They need me this weekend,
even though I am being disrespected,
even though I am not being paid, no
matter what I want to say, I know
what I am going to say. I am going to
say: Yes, I will come in and make sure
this White House, this Capitol, this
country looks as beautiful as it can
look for these schoolchildren and these
visitors.
I think we have to up our game, all of
us. I know we can do this. We owe it to
our citizens. We owe it to our workers.
We owe it to our Nation’s reputation.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.J. RES. 1

imous consent that the Senate proceed

endar No. 6, H.J. Res. 1, making further

S. 181
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today,
along with my colleague Senator CAR-
PER, I am introducing the Comprehen-
sive National Mercury Monitoring Act.
This bill would ensure that we have ac-
curate, detailed information about the
extent of mercury pollution in the
United States.
The issue of mercury emissions is
growing in importance around the
world. In 2013, the United States was
the first country to join and sign the
Minamata Convention on Mercury, a
global agreement to reduce mercury
pollution. The Minamata Convention
has since been signed by more than 125
countries, demonstrating the wide-
spread concern that mercury poses a
global threat to human health. At
present, however, scientists must rely
on limited information to understand
the critical linkages between mercury
emissions and environmental response
and human health. Successful design,
implementation, and assessment of so-
lutions to the mercury pollution prob-
lem require a comprehensive long-term
solution. It requires much more infor-
mation. A system for collecting such
information, such as we have for acid
rain and other pollution, does not cur-
rently exist for mercury, a much more
toxic pollutant.
Mercury is a potent neurotoxin of
significant ecological and public health
concern, especially for children and
pregnant women. It is estimated that
approximately 200,000 children born in
our country each year have been ex-
posed to levels of mercury in the womb
that are high enough to impair their
neurological development. Mercury ex-
posure has gone down as U.S. mercury
emissions have declined, and over the
last decade coal-fired power plants in
the United States have reduced their
mercury emissions by nearly 90 per-
cent, but emission levels remain far
too high, given how potent a
neurotoxin mercury is.
A comprehensive national mercury
monitoring network is needed to pro-
tect human health, safeguard our fish-
eries, and track the effect of emissions

reductions. This tracking is important
in light of increasing mercury emis-
sions from other countries, including a
substantial amount of mercury emis-
sions from China. Mercury can be
transported around the globe, meaning
emissions and releases can affect
human health and environment even in
remote locations.
This network is particularly impor-
tant after the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency’s recent proposal on the
Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.
Last month, the EPA released a pro-
posal that determined it is no longer
‘‘appropriate and necessary’’ to regu-
late mercury and toxic air pollution
from coal- and oil-fired plants. I just do
not understand why EPA would send
that signal. While the EPA has not pro-
posed to change the current emission
standards on mercury and the toxic air
pollutants in this regulation, the
EPA’s action has put the standards in
legal jeopardy and could block future
efforts to strengthen this standard that
is so important to protecting human
health and our environment.
By accurately quantifying regional
and national changes in atmospheric
deposition, ecosystem contamination,
and bioaccumulation of mercury in fish
and wildlife in response to changes in
mercury emissions, a monitoring net-
work would help policymakers, the
EPA, scientists, physicians, and the
public to better understand the
sources, consequences, and trends in
mercury pollution in the United
States. We must have more comprehen-
sive information and data. Otherwise,
we risk making misguided policy deci-
sions.
Specifically, our legislation would di-
rect the EPA, in conjunction with the
Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Ge-
ological Survey, the National Park
Service, the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration, and other
appropriate Federal Agencies to estab-
lish a national mercury monitoring
program to measure and monitor mer-
cury levels in the air and watersheds,
water and soil chemistry, and in ma-
rine, freshwater, and terrestrial orga-
nisms across the Nation.
Second, it would establish a sci-
entific advisory committee to advise
on the establishment, site selection,
measurement, recording protocols, and
operations of this monitoring program.
Third, our bill would establish a cen-
tralized database for existing and
newly collected environmental mer-
cury data that can be freely accessed
on the internet and is comprised of
data that are compatible with similar
international efforts.
The bill would also require a report
to Congress every 2 years on the pro-
gram, including trends, and an assess-
ment of the reduction in mercury rates
that need to be achieved in order to
prevent adverse human and ecological
effects, and that report would be re-
quired every 4 years.
Finally, the bill authorizes $95 mil-
lion over 3 years to carry out the Act.
I am pleased to report that this legis-
lation—this bipartisan bill—has earned
the endorsement of the American Lung
Association, the Biodiversity Research
Institute, the Environmental Health
Strategy Center, the League of Con-
servation Voters, and the Natural Re-
sources Defense Council. A comprehen-
sive, robust national monitoring net-
work for mercury would provide the
data needed to help make the decisions
to protect the people—particularly,
pregnant women and babies and chil-
dren—and the environment of Maine
and the entire United States.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I

LINS). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I
am here today to talk about the ongo-
ing partial government shutdown, the
crisis along the southern border, and
how we can resolve this in a respon-
sible way.
We are now on day 28 of the govern-
ment shutdown, and I am more dis-
couraged now than I have been during
this entire impasse. We are better than
this. We are stuck. Eight hundred
thousand workers have missed a pay-
check, and there is no end in sight.
NASA workers in Cleveland, TSA em-
ployees at our airports across Ohio,
Coast Guard officers on Lake Erie—
they have all contacted me, as have
others. But the harm being done to
these families and these workers isn’t
the only thing that is happening with
the shutdown.
I have been through five of these
shutdowns since I worked in the White
House for the first President Bush. I re-
member in 1990 when we had a weekend
shutdown, and everybody thought that
was dramatic. Here we are with the
longest shutdown in our history. I
don’t like government shutdowns. I
don’t think they are good for tax-
payers. Every shutdown, we always end
up paying more as taxpayers. I don’t
think anybody likes them—at least not
anybody outside the beltway. Some in
both parties seem to like to use shut-
downs, but they are not good for fami-
lies who are affected, and they are not
good for the economy. They cost the
taxpayers more.
On the economy, we now have a re-
port from the Council of Economic Ad-
visers, who tell us this week that the
shutdown is going to reduce quarterly
economic growth by 0.13 percent for
every week it lasts. In other words,
every week the shutdown continues,
the economy is hurt more. We have a
great economy right now. Thanks to
the tax cuts and the regulatory relief
and other things this Congress has
done, we have record levels of employ-
ment. More people are employed than
ever in our history. We have histori-
cally low unemployment. We are bring-
ing people out of the shadows, back
into work, off the sidelines.
There is a lot of positive out there,
but this is taking us the wrong way. It
is partly the impact on Federal em-
ployees, because their purchasing
power is less. We are told that of the
$312 billion for fiscal year 2019 that
hasn’t been appropriated by this Con-
gress—and that is what the shutdown
is; about 25 percent of government is
not being funded. That is hundreds of
millions of dollars each workday that
are not going out to Federal employ-
ees. So part of the economic impact is
that people have less spending power,
and part of it is that contractors and a
lot of small businesses are not getting
paid, so it has an impact on the econ-
omy in that way. Again, what happens
in the end is that everybody gets paid
back, but in the meantime, services are
disrupted. It is a very inefficient way
to run government, and taxpayers end
up spending more, not less.
I am not big on shutdowns, having
lived through five of them, but I have
to say I have never been more frus-
trated than with this shutdown. I am
frustrated for a very simple reason:
The solution is right before us. The
reason we are in this shutdown is that
both sides are unwilling to sit down
and talk. That makes this shutdown
particularly stupid.
The issue before us is what to do with
regard to border security where, in
fact, there is a lot of agreement. Bor-
der security is one where we don’t have
these fundamental disagreements, as
we might on, let’s say, tax cuts or
healthcare policy. This is about wheth-
er we should be securing our southern
border. I think my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle, when pressed, will
say: Yes, of course we should.
If you look at the specifics, we are
not that far apart. That is what is most
frustrating to me about this one—that
we can bring people together and
achieve a result here. I am going to
talk about what that might mean.
I have been working with some col-
leagues, including the Presiding Offi-
cer, on trying to figure out a way for-
ward. We haven’t been successful yet.
There are plenty of folks who want to
get to yes in this Chamber, and we
have to figure out a way to provide a
forum to do that, to make it happen.
I am not here today on the floor to
assign blame, to point fingers. There
are plenty of people doing that. That is
easy to do because there is lots of
blame to go all around. I am here to
talk about how to find that common
ground.
Of course, we have to do more to se-
cure our southern border. I consider it
a crisis. Some of my colleagues say it
is not a crisis. Some say it is a crisis.
Forget the words. We have a problem
on the southern border.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S303
January 18, 2019
Here is some of the data. During Sep-
tember and October of last year, Cus-
toms and Border Protection agents ap-
prehended more than 100,000 people try-
ing to enter the country illegally. This
has nearly doubled the number from
the same months in 2017. In the most
recent data we have—October and No-
vember, just a couple of months ago—
there is double the number of people
apprehended between the ports of entry
as we had the year before.
The big increase is families and kids.
This is a very tough issue. According
to the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, there has been a 50-percent in-
crease in the number of families com-
ing across the border illegally and a 25-
percent increase in the number of un-
accompanied children.
Along with that, there has been a
2,000-percent increase in asylum claims
over the last 5 years—a 2,000 percent
increase in asylum claims over the last
5 years.
The largest growth is coming, as we
know, from three Central American
countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, and
Honduras. While 9 out of 10 of these
claims are ultimately rejected by the
immigration courts, the applicants
have long since been released into the
interior of the United States. That is a
problem. We should all be working on
that.
How do we address this problem?
There are some constructive ideas on
both sides of the aisle on how to deal
with that, but it is a real problem. In
fiscal year 2018, Customs and Border
Protection referred nearly 50,000 ac-
companied minors—almost all of whom
came across the southern border to
seek asylum—to the Department of
Health and Human Services for care.
I have done a lot of work on this
issue in the Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations of the Homeland Se-
curity Committee and found out about
some of the care these kids have gotten
and some of the trauma these kids
have gone through. HHS is currently
housing more than 11,000 of these chil-
dren. Many have experienced vio-
lence—as I say, serious trauma—on
their journey to the United States and
need significant help.
Furthermore, the Drug Enforcement
Administration has reported that the
southwest border ‘‘remains the pri-
mary entry point for heroin into the
United States.’’ There is no disagree-
ment about that. I am told that 90 per-
cent of the heroin that we are experi-
encing in our communities here comes
across the southern border.
Fentanyl comes primarily from
China. We made some progress there
because it comes primarily through the
post office from China. We just passed
legislation to deal with that. Fentanyl
is the most powerful drug out there—50
times more powerful than heroin on av-
erage—causes most of the overdoses in
my State of Ohio and around the coun-
try.
Guess what. More and more of that
fentanyl is coming across the southern
border. Last year, seizures of
fentanyl—a synthetic heroin that is
causing all these deaths and
overdoses—increased by 135 percent
last year compared to 2017.
Part of what is happening is that it
comes from China to Mexico and from
Mexico into the United States, we are
told by law enforcement. Then, over
the last year, we have seen the sci-
entists in Mexico—evil scientists in
Mexico—cook up in these ‘‘super labs’’
crystal meth—methamphetamines,
crystal meth, pure crystal meth—that
is coming into our communities.
In the last couple of weeks, I have
been at three meetings where I bring
together the people on the drug abuse
task forces of different parts of our
State, and I have talked a lot about the
opioid crisis, where I spent a lot of
time and effort. What they tell me is
that we are making progress on
opioids, finally—thank God—for the
first time in 7 years.
Guess what the new scourge is—crys-
tal meth. It is more pure than ever,
more powerful than ever.
So that is coming from where? It is
coming from Mexico. It is a 135-percent
increase, as we talked about, from
fentanyl. We have also seen a 38-per-
cent increase in methamphetamine
trafficking across the southern border
just from 2017 to 2018.
This drug issue is a big deal as well,
and we need to do more. By the way,
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle agree with that. They would like
to see more funding immediately for
better screening at ports of entry, as
an example. Most of these drugs come
in through cars and trucks that cross
our border.
While we have been paying attention
to this China issue with fentanyl, what
is happening in our southern border
continues with very little interdiction
on our part.
I met with the Customs and Border
Protection Commissioner last month
in my office. I asked him: How many of
these drugs are you intercepting?
He had to acknowledge: We don’t
know, of course, but very few.
They need better equipment. They
need better technology. They need
more people.
I don’t think these numbers are sus-
tainable—the number of families, the
number of children coming in, the
number of asylum claims, the number
of drugs coming across our border—for
our Border Patrol, for our judicial sys-
tem, for our education and health sys-
tems, and for our communities.
Because of all these problems, we
need a broad solution at the border.
Experts tell us that our solutions
should include more physical barriers,
which the President talks about a lot,
but, also, more Border Patrol agents,
more technology, more surveillance,
more drones, more cameras, more
screening at our ports of entry, and
more technology there to stop this ille-
gal flow of drugs.
There was a time when all this
wasn’t all that controversial. In 2006,
Congress enacted on a bipartisan basis
legislation called the Secure Fence
Act. You have probably heard about it.
It authorized 700 miles of additional
fencing or physical barriers along the
border. Then-Senator Barack Obama
voted for the Secure Fence Act. Then-
Senator Hillary Clinton voted for the
Secure Fence Act. Senator CHUCK
SCHUMER voted for this bill. It passed
by 80 to 19, an overwhelming bipartisan
approval.
As recently as 2013, all of the Senate
Democrats and two Independents voted
for a broader immigration reform plan
that called for no fewer than 700 miles
of border fencing. That measure ulti-
mately failed in the House. Let me re-
peat that. Every single Democrat in
the Senate voted for that bill. Who was
the lead sponsor? Senator CHUCK SCHU-
MER, the minority leader.
So asking for additional barriers and
fencing along the border as part of a
broader strategy to make it more se-
cure shouldn’t be that controversial. Is
it the only answer? No, it is not.
Having said all of that, when you re-
move the partisan politics and political
symbolism, I continue to believe that
we are not that far apart. If you look
at the January 6 letter the Trump ad-
ministration sent to the Congress, say-
ing, ‘‘Please fund these priorities,’’ you
will see that the response to what is
happening along our border that they
are proposing is not that far from
where we are in the Congress.
Yes, it asks for more barriers. I
would think from hearing, frankly,
from both sides—from the administra-
tion and from the Democrats in Con-
gress—that it would be a wall across
2,000 miles of the border. It is not. That
is not the proposal. The proposal is—
and I am reading from it—234 miles of
new barriers and fencing—not 2,000
miles but 234 miles of additional bar-
riers of some kind.
As you know, the President has now
made clear that he is prepared to con-
struct these barriers not as a cement
wall but as a fence, what he calls a
steel barrier. The White House also
made clear in their submission that
these barriers would be constructed in
a manner consistent with the existing
language in the Senate committee-
passed bipartisan Homeland Security
appropriations bill. That means the
definition of the border barrier that
Republicans and Democrats have long
voted for would be the definition used
for the construction of these new bar-
riers.
It is $5.7 billion in funding for the
construction of additional physical
barriers along the southern border,
consistent with what the experts say
we ought to use—both in terms of the
type of barrier and where the barrier
ought to be.
Again, based on the 2006 law, more
than 500 miles of fencing have already
been built in California, in Arizona,
and in New Mexico. Based on the
data—the actual data—they are mak-
ing a difference. If you talk to folks in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S304 January 18, 2019
those communities and you talk to
Customs and Border Protection, they
like having those barriers. At a min-
imum, it slows people down, and it
keeps vehicles from going across some
of that desert landscape. This is part of
a broader strategy that is primarily
used now in California, Arizona, and
New Mexico.
The 2006 law resulted in 105 miles of
fencing in California, 211 miles in Ari-
zona, and 107 miles in the sector that
spans both Arizona and California. This
also includes 166 miles of fencing in a
sector that spans New Mexico and
Texas, though most of this is in New
Mexico. In Texas, in total, there is less
than 100 miles of fencing. This is where
the priority is now for the Border Pa-
trol, in Texas. Why? Because Texas has
1,200 miles of the 2,000-mile border. Yet
they only have 100 miles of barriers.
The new fencing that the administra-
tion has requested, as we understand it,
is particularly necessary in the most
populated parts of the Rio Grande Val-
ley on the Texas-Mexico border. By the
way, that is where 40 percent of the
crossings occur. You would think it
makes sense to have more barriers
there.
Again, it is not all about barriers. It
has to be an all-of-the-above strategy.
The $5.7 billion in barriers, which is
about $4 billion more than the bipar-
tisan Senate Homeland Security appro-
priations bill, is what they are pro-
posing. It is about $4 billion more—$4.1
billion, I think, to be exact—than what
is in the bill that has already been
agreed to on a bipartisan basis.
In December, Democrats proposed
$1.3 billion for the same purpose, which
is actually a reduction in the amount
they initially proposed in November,
the month before, of $1.6 billion.
Folks, there is a way to find common
ground here, especially if you include,
with this 234 miles of additional bar-
riers to be determined by the experts
as to what kind of barrier and where it
goes, other immigration policies that
many on the other side of the aisle
strongly support—and some of us do
too—like dealing with DACA. This has
been talked about, and it has become a
political football. Let’s resolve it.
These are young people who came
here as children through no fault of
their own. Their families brought them
here as kids. They were minors. They
are not responsible for breaking immi-
gration laws.
Now they are young people. Some of
them are working, some of them are in
school, and some of them are in the
military. They are looking for some
certainty.
I think the Congress can provide
that. As part of an overall package
here, it makes sense to include some-
thing on DACA. A lot of Democrats
who talked about this over the years
strongly agree with that.
The President has also asked, in ad-
dition to looking at DACA, that in the
context of overall immigration reform,
we would look at this issue of Tem-
porary Protected Status, or TPS. This
is something that many Democrats feel
very strongly about. TPS allows the
government to provide protection for
individuals who come from particu-
larly trouble-stricken countries. There
are now 10 countries on that list. The
Secretary of Homeland Security has
the ability to provide harbor for those
individuals from those 10 countries.
Sometimes it is because of a natural
disaster. Sometimes it is because of a
war. Sometimes it is because of vio-
lence in those countries. They simply
have to present themselves at ports of
entry and begin the application process
and go through a legal process to
apply. Some of these temporary visas
that these individuals under TPS cur-
rently have are expiring.
Again, there are a lot of Senators,
particularly on the other side of the
aisle, who feel strongly about this.
Senator KAINE has been a champion for
these individuals. There are tens of
thousands of them in his State of Vir-
ginia. Senators would like to see im-
mediate relief there. I think that could
be part of a mix here.
The President has also requested $675
million to help stop drug smuggling at
our ports of entry; $211 million to hire
another 750 Border Patrol agents; $800
million for humanitarian needs to fund
enhanced medical support, transpor-
tation, and temporary facilities for
those who are detained at our border.
The Homeland Security appropriations
bill already includes funding for all of
those purposes, but the President has
requested additional funds to help deal
with this influx we talked about—more
families, more unaccompanied chil-
dren, in particular. He has also re-
quested $563 million for 75 additional
immigration judges and support staff
so that we can help reduce the case
backlog of nearly 800,000 pending immi-
gration cases.
Again, a lot of Democrats and Repub-
licans, including me, have talked about
the need for this. This backlog is part
of our problem because people are typi-
cally in the communities, and many of
them don’t show up for their court
cases. Part of the problem is the back-
log, the amount of time it takes—
months. That can be reduced.
Finally, the President has requested
an additional $631 million for counter-
narcotics and weapons technology.
Again, this is one I feel strongly about.
I know a lot of my colleagues do. Sen-
ator SCHUMER has talked eloquently in
the past about needing better screening
at ports of entry to try to stop some of
these drugs from coming in. I believe
these are reasonable requests.
Where there is disagreement, let’s
have a debate over it, and let’s come to
a compromise. But we have to have a
real adult conversation for that to
occur.
The irony for me, for those of us who
support a stronger presence on the
southern border, is that this shutdown
is hurting our efforts to secure the bor-
der and to make our immigration sys-
tem work better.
First, U.S. Border Patrol agents and
Customs and Border Protection officers
are continuing to work without pay.
We want to increase the morale of
those brave officers along the border. It
is hard to increase morale when they
are working without pay.
More than 40,000 immigration hear-
ings have been canceled. Think about
that. There are 40,000 immigration
hearings that have already been can-
celed, contributing to this backlog that
already totals 800,000 cases.
E-verify, the government system
used to verify the immigration status
of workers to determine whether they
are illegal, to allow employers to reject
people who are not legally in this coun-
try—that e-verify system is incredibly
important because, ultimately, those
jobs are the magnet. Right? That is
what is pulling people across the bor-
der more than anything else. Now that
system is shut down because the gov-
ernment is shut down—that part of
government—meaning employers
across the United States are unable to
effectively know who is legal or not.
That doesn’t help us with regard to the
border.
For all of these reasons, we need to
come together and negotiate a solu-
tion. We are not that far apart.
Last week, out of frustration that no
progress was being made, my colleague
JERRY MORAN of Kansas and I intro-
duced legislation that would establish
a $25 billion border trust fund over the
next 5 years to enhance border security
across the board—all the things we
have talked about.
The legislation would also codify pro-
tections for the DACA population we
talked about. Again, it is very impor-
tant to so many in this Chamber, par-
ticularly on the other side of the aisle.
In my view, this is a fair and reason-
able solution for all sides, and I believe
we could get the necessary votes if it
were brought to the floor.
Others have better ideas, I am sure.
Let’s hear them. Let’s have a negotia-
tion on all of these issues, but let’s get
to a resolution.
It has been reported in the media
that I have been working with Senator
GRAHAM, Senator COLLINS, Senator
ALEXANDER, Senator MURKOWSKI, Sen-
ator GARDNER, along with Senator
COONS, Senator KAINE, Senator CARDIN,
Senator MANCHIN, and others. This has
been in the press. I am not reporting
anything to you today that is not al-
ready known. It has been said that we
are trying to figure out a way forward,
and we are.
Democrats have insisted that there
can’t be a negotiation until the govern-
ment shutdown has ended. So a bunch
of us have said: Well, what if we do
this? One, let’s get a commitment from
Democrats that they will seriously ne-
gotiate based on the President’s re-
quest. I think it is a reasonable re-
quest.
Having received that commitment,
then let’s have a short-term cessation
here of the shutdown—maybe for a few

weeks, maybe for a couple of weeks—to
give us the space and the time to be
able to work out an agreement.
There are a substantial number of
Members from our side and the other
side who have agreed to sign a letter
along those lines. I am hopeful that
can provide at least one opportunity to
move forward. It is the only one I see
right now.
If there is a better idea, I am eager to
hear it, and I know my colleagues are
too. More importantly, I know the peo-
ple I represent are, both those who are
directly impacted and those who are
watching and saying: Why can’t Wash-
ington get its act together? This makes
no sense.
Yes, we should provide additional se-
curity for our southern border. Why
can’t we agree to that?
We are not that far apart.
Why can’t we end the government
shutdown in the process and allow the
normal operations to go back into
place so that families, government
workers are not put in this position
where, working paycheck to paycheck,
they now don’t have a paycheck and
where taxpayers can get the services
they have paid for and not end up pay-
ing more money after the fact, which is
what typically happens in these shut-
downs.
By the way, I do hope we can stop
using government shutdowns alto-
gether. I don’t like them, as I said, and
last week, I introduced legislation,
along with eight of my Republican col-
leagues, that is called the End Govern-
ment Shutdowns Act. It is pretty
straightforward. I have introduced it
every single Congress since I was elect-
ed in 2010.
What it says is, if you get to the end
of the process and the appropriations
bill is not funded by Congress—and our
fiscal yearend is September 30, so we
have been living since then on these
continuing resolutions. But if you end
up with not getting an appropriations
bill done or if you get to the end of a
continuing resolution and there is no
resolution—you have this impasse—in-
stead of having the government shut
down, what you do is just continue the
spending from the previous year. Then,
after 120 days, you reduce it by 1 per-
cent, and then, after another 90 days,
you reduce it by another 1 percent.
Why? To give Congress the incentive
to get their act together and to actu-
ally fund the government appro-
priately, to pass these appropriations
bills, which should provide not just
funding but reforms to government
programs. That is the idea. We should
every year be looking at all of the gov-
ernment and saying: What is working?
What is not working? What are we
going to fund more? What are we going
to fund less? What are we going to
eliminate? What are we going to cre-
ate? Something new and good for our
country and our constituents. So that
is what we want to incentivize by the
End Government Shutdowns Act.
I hope that Members on both sides of
the aisle can support this and that,
looking forward, we will not have gov-
ernment shutdowns. We wouldn’t be in
this mess today if that legislation were
law.
The bottom line is, we have the op-
portunity before us to reach a fair
agreement. Both sides are going to
have to move some. The President is
going to have to negotiate, and he says
that he will.
The Speaker of the House is going to
have to move some. According to news
reports, Speaker PELOSI flat-out told
the press she would not support $1 dol-
lar for any new barriers, even if the
government were reopened and every-
thing that she asked for was granted.
That is not serious. That is not the
way to have a successful negotiation,
especially when Democrats, as I laid
out earlier, have long supported more
barriers and fencing along the southern
border.
So let’s act in good faith. Let’s move
forward to a responsible resolution.
That means, yes, we reopen govern-
ment, but we also secure the southern
border. We are not that far apart. We
just need to have the will to get it
done.
I yield the floor.

HONORING MAYOR JIM WEST
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 18, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the memory of the late Mayor of San
Juan Bautista, Jim West, for his outstanding
career in public service and his commitment to
the people of the central coast of California.
His professional accomplishments and leader-
ship in the community have profoundly
touched the lives of many.
Mayor West served his community in San
Benito County for over 20 years in multiple ca-
pacities. He was appointed to San Benito
County Parks and Recreation Commission,
served as vice chairman of San Benito Coun-
ty’s General Plan Update Committee, served
on the United Way Board of Directors, and
was the recipient of many honorable awards
commemorating his outstanding character. In
addition to his heavy involvement in the com-
munity, Mayor West also honorably served our
country in the United States Marine Corps.
Throughout his ten years in public office,
Mayor West served the City of San Juan
Bautista as a dynamic and effective leader.
Colleagues and friends alike praised his ability
to compromise and put community needs at
the forefront of his priorities. Mayor West was
the recipient of two National Philanthropy
Awards, the Gavilan College Community Spirit
Award, and the San Benito Community Lead-
ership Award. His presence in the community
transformed many lives, and he will be re-
membered as a distinguished community
member, mayor, and friend.
Mayor Jim West’s legacy is defined by his
invaluable work as a public servant. His dedi-
cation to the community and to the people in
his life serves as an inspiration to the Central
Coast of California. He is survived by his
daughter, granddaughter, and great-grand-
daughter, and his legacy will live on with them
and in the memories of those of us who had
the honor to know him. Madam Speaker, I ask
that my colleagues in the House join me in
honoring Mayor Jim West.
