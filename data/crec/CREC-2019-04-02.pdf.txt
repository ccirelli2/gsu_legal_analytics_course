BROKEN PROMISES FOR
HURRICANE MICHAEL RELIEF
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr.
Speaker, on October 10, 2018, a Cat-
egory 3 storm, Hurricane Michael, en-
tered my State of Georgia with a dev-
astating force.
It was harvest time for the 2018 crop,
and it was the best yield, especially for
cotton, that we had seen in years.
Farmers who had been suffering in the
midst of low commodity prices, unfair
trade prices, labor shortages, and con-
secutive years of storms now had relief
in sight. Then entered Hurricane Mi-
chael, and it was all gone in a matter
of hours. Not just the commodity crops
like cotton, but the orchards, too.
Since day one post-Hurricane Mi-
chael, I have worked side by side with
my friend and my colleague, Congress-
man SANFORD BISHOP. Hurricane Mi-
chael didn’t discriminate between our
district lines. I want to thank him for
his help and his support of our State
and our agricultural producers in Geor-
gia.
Soon after the storm, the President,
Vice President PENCE, and Secretary
Perdue met with the two of us, our
farmers, and our community leaders
and promised to help them rebuild.
Members of both parties, in both
Chambers of Congress, echoed the same
support. Six months later, and those
promises of support have been broken.
Never before have we seen commu-
nities that were wrecked with catas-
trophes neglected like this.
Those votes in the Senate yesterday
showed a lack of honor and dignity and
how truly ugly and partisan politics
have become. The truth is, if Hurricane
Michael had hit Americans who
weren’t farmers or farmers who aren’t
Americans, the stories of yesterday’s
cowardice would be the front page of
every paper.
Whether the press likes it or not and
whether the Senators from New York
or Vermont like it or not, we are
Americans, too. And what happened
yesterday was cowardly, partisan poli-
tics and truly un-American.
f
IMMIGRANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO
NEW JERSEY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
honor the hard work and dedication of
immigrant communities across New
Jersey and across this country.
Earlier this month, the New Jersey
Policy Perspective issued a report con-
firming something we have known for a
long time in my district and in New
Jersey: immigrants continue to serve
as the backbone of Main Street.
Immigrants make up 22 percent of
the total State population, and immi-
grants own 47 percent of Main Street
businesses. Immigrant communities
own 81 percent of household mainte-
nance services, 79 percent of laundry
businesses, and nearly 50 percent of
child care centers and clothing stores.
According to the study, immigrants
contribute $4.4 billion a year to just
the New Jersey economy, employing
thousands and driving economic
growth.
This study is just another reminder
that toxic rhetoric against immigra-
tion is a misguided attack against our
neighbors, our teachers, our fire-
fighters, and local shop owners. As a
first generation American, I can attest
firsthand to the grit and determination
needed to succeed in this country.
These brave families sacrifice every-
thing to work hard in America and pro-
vide opportunities for their loved ones.
Supporting immigrant communities
is the right thing to do to advance
American values and boost job growth
across the country.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say
thank you to the immigrants working
hard across the State of New Jersey
and across this country.
f
FULL PROTECTION FOR BABIES
BORN ALIVE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to address the House on an im-
portant issue, and maybe the most im-
portant issue, Mr. Speaker, and that is
the issue of life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2942 April 2, 2019
We brought a bill forward, H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act. This is a bill, Mr. Speaker,
that many wonder why is it even nec-
essary that we need a law to say that
if a baby is born alive, outside of the
womb, we need to give it the full pro-
tections under law.
Many people ask, Mr. Speaker, why
isn’t that already protected? If a baby
is born alive, it should have the full
protections of anybody else. And yet,
as we see in States like New York and
other States around the country, they
allow, in those States, the baby, even
after it is born alive, to be killed. To
me, Mr. Speaker, that is murder, and
yet, in many States, they don’t have
the full protection that all of us enjoy.
How could that be, in the United
States of America, that a baby born
alive can still be killed after it is born
outside of the womb?
This issue transcends the abortion
debate. In fact, people across every
spectrum—Republicans, Democrats,
and Independents, even people who
align themselves as pro-choice—believe
it is wrong to murder the baby after it
is born alive, and yet it is still allowed.
There should be no reason that this is
a gray issue.
Today, Mr. Speaker, I will be joining
my colleague, ANN WAGNER, the lead
author of this bill, to start a discharge
petition: an opportunity for every
Member of Congress to make their
voices heard loud and clear that this
bill ought to come to this floor for a
full debate and, ultimately, for a vote.
We ought to pass this law, Mr.
Speaker. There should be no doubt. It
shouldn’t be a partisan issue. It
shouldn’t be an issue that we have dis-
agreement over, and yet we do. For
whatever reason, the Speaker will not
allow this bill, though, to come up for
a vote. We have tried time after time
to move unanimous consent to bring
this bill to the floor and, for months,
that motion has been denied.
The most vulnerable among us
should no longer be denied that protec-
tion under the law. Mr. Speaker, this
bill has to come up for a vote. This bill
has to be debated by the people’s
House.
Why not allow people all across the
country to participate in this debate?
As they find out about it, the reaction
I get is not a debate on political lines,
it is shock that this isn’t already law.
Every baby born alive, Mr. Speaker,
ought to have the full protection under
law that is currently provided to all of
us. H.R. 962 should be one of the easiest
things that we pass through this
House, yet, unfortunately, it has be-
come one of the most difficult. But
that is okay, Mr. Speaker. We know
that it is the difficult things that we
come here to do, not the easy, because
it would have already been done.
So we are going to be leading the
charge today, standing with people all
across the country. And, in fact, we are
actually bringing in people, Mr. Speak-
er, who survived an attempted abor-
tion. It happens all across this country.
And when that baby is born alive, that
baby ought to have the full protection
under the law. We will start the proc-
ess today to ensure that that full de-
bate happens and, ultimately, that the
vote happens to pass the Born Alive
Act.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to sign on to this discharge pe-
tition.

AMERICANS DEPEND ON CLEAN
WATER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO) for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, as
the chair of the Transportation and In-
frastructure Subcommittee on Water
Resources and Environment, I rise to
celebrate Clean Water Week. I would
like to take this opportunity to high-
light the importance of water for our
communities, not only in my home
State of California, but across the
country. Americans depend on clean
water for their health, the health of
their communities, and the health of
the economy.
Our water resources are precious, and
every drop matters, which is why we
need significant Federal investment in
our Nation’s infrastructure and strong
Federal protections for our Nation’s
water resources.
We need to protect our waterways,
large and small, from pollution; ensure
we conserve our water resources; recy-
cle water where we can; and protect
our groundwater resources for long-
term reliance.
There are tremendous clean water in-
frastructure needs facing our country.
Our communities, large and small,
urban and rural, and tribal, as well as
our American families are facing great
challenges in meeting these needs.
Today, our Nation’s network of sew-
ers, stormwater conveyances, and
treatment facilities are aging, often
very outdated, and, in many places all
over the country, not meeting the
needs of our communities or water
quality standards.
We, in Congress, need to do more, not
only to renew the Federal financial
commitment to repair, replace, and up-
grade our water-related infrastructure,
but also to ensure that this work re-
mains affordable to all of our commu-
nities.
Today, too many Americans are un-
certain whether their drinking water is
safe for themselves and for their fami-
lies. Now is not the time to cut back on
the protections of our Nation’s clean
water. Yet, this administration is pro-
posing to do just that.
For more than 45 years, the Clean
Water Act has helped to protect our
streams, our rivers, our wetlands, and
our lakes, and provided States with the
tools to keep our waters clean. This ad-
ministration has proposed eliminating
longstanding protections for small
streams and wetlands, which play a
very important role in feeding our
drinking water resources. They also
help store water during storms and al-
leviate flooding, which, in turn, pro-
tects communities. These small
streams and wetlands help recharge
our groundwater supplies. They also
filter pollution and provide habitat for
fish and wildlife.
Clean and safe water is a very basic
human need. Unfortunately, this ad-
ministration has made it a priority to
dismantle the Clean Water Act, regard-
less of what the science or the law pro-
vides. The President’s
#DirtyWaterRule puts our water and
health at risk and must be stopped.
Our drought cycle in southern Cali-
fornia continues, even though we have
had repeated rain in March. We must
continue to conserve. This must be the
new norm for us in the West.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH
ANNIVERSARY OF EASTERSEALS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
Easterseals on its 100th anniversary.
Easterseals is a network of more
than 70 leading nonprofit organizations
that provide local services and support
to children and adults with disabilities,
veterans, and older adults.
Founded in 1919 in Ohio, Easterseals
works nationwide, in almost every
State, to help Americans achieve mile-
stones, live independently, and be ac-
tive members of their communities.
Easterseals employs more than 30,000
professional staff across the country,
including therapists, nurses, employ-
ment specialists, and direct support
professionals who deliver high-quality
services.
Over the past century, Easterseals
has helped millions of individuals and
families by assisting children who have
disabilities; helping them access early
intervention, including physical and
speech therapies, to help prepare them
for successful learning; providing in-
home and community adult day serv-
ices for seniors and people with disabil-
ities; helping individuals with disabil-
ities, veterans, and seniors find mean-
ingful employment; and providing
camping and recreational opportuni-
ties to youth and adults with disabil-
ities.
Mr. Speaker, Easterseals provides au-
tistic individuals early education, em-
ployment, camping, caregiving, trans-
portation, and other services to sup-
port Americans of all ages.
The number of children in the U.S.
with developmental delays is on the
rise. A recent study found that ap-
proximately 13 percent of infants and
toddlers have a developmental delay.
Research has also shown that one in

three children who receive early inter-
vention services will not require spe-
cial education in preschool.
Mr. Speaker, we know that the first
few years of a child’s life will lay the
foundation for his or her long-term
well-being and overall success. That is
why I am a strong proponent of Head
Start and Early Head Start programs.
We can’t guarantee that every child
will be successful in life, but we can
give them the same access to early
educational opportunities. This is just
one of many reasons why I introduced
H.R. 1695, the Community Services
Block Grant Reauthorization Act of
2019. This legislation renews our Na-
tion’s commitment to reducing poverty
through locally driven comprehensive
approaches.
Head Start and early education pro-
grams are operated through commu-
nity action agencies and promote
school readiness through enhancing the
cognitive, physical, behavorial, and so-
cial-emotional development of children
from low-income families. Easterseals
specializes in early childhood develop-
ment where children with and without
disabilities can learn together.
Another piece of legislation I am co-
sponsoring is H.R. 1878, the IDEA Full
Funding Act. This would ensure that
individuals with disabilities are receiv-
ing an appropriate education.
In the 1970s, Congress promised to
cover 40 percent of the extra cost of
special education, but we never come
close to fulfilling that promise. In fact,
current funding remains only at 14 per-
cent of the targeted amount. This bill
would mandate gradual increases in
IDEA funding to reach the full commit-
ment—40 percent, a commitment made
by Congress—by fiscal year 2029 and
each subsequent fiscal year after that.
Easterseals is also supportive of this
legislation.
In the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania, three Easterseals affiliates serve
67 counties. They employ almost 700
people, and they serve nearly 27,900 in-
dividuals. Mr. Speaker, these are just
some of the incredible services
Easterseals works to provide to Amer-
ican families.
For the past 100 years, it has lever-
aged its network of nonprofits to im-
prove the lives of others. In schools,
workplaces, and communities,
Easterseals has fostered environments
where everyone is included and valued,
regardless of age or ability.
I congratulate Easterseals for its
contributions to improving so many
lives over the past 100 years.
f
LET MY FARMERS GROW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I sel-
dom come to this floor to stand in this
well. To me, it is almost a sacred place
where the great orators like Webster
debated. But I have got to talk about
this because it is something that is im-
pacting thousands and thousands of
people I represent in my district.
In a recent letter from the President
of the Missouri Soybean Association,
farmers expressed their concerns re-
garding President Trump’s ongoing
statements on tariffs and the U.S.-
China trade relationships, stating:
‘‘Missouri farmers have invested time
away from their farm, family, and mil-
lions of dollars in developing their for-
eign markets, and it’s imperative that
we don’t jeopardize these investments.
. . .’’
At what point do we call on one an-
other to address the inevitable det-
riment these farmers are routinely
placed in under this administration?
In Missouri alone, the restricted ac-
cess to China, which is the number one
trading partner for U.S. soybean farm-
ers, has created a $2 drop in soybean
prices, resulting in nearly $212 million
in lost earnings, over 3,000 fewer jobs,
and an estimated $726.6 million annual
reduction in State and local economic
activity—for the State of Missouri
alone. Imagine the combined impact
this has had on other States that are
major producers and exporters.
Using America’s farmers as collateral
in a trade war is wrong, and hard-
working farmers, their families, and
our communities deserve much better.
Farmers in Missouri and across this
country working to not only provide
for their families deserve market sta-
bility and access to the opportunity to
forge trade relationships abroad. They
deserve to have the backing of a Fed-
eral Government that supports and ad-
vocates for their success.
Simply put, farmers deserve not to be
caught in the crossfire or become col-
lateral damage in an imposed and im-
practical trade war.
Farming is a risky endeavor, and
Mother Nature may at any time bring
drought, flooding, hail, and other disas-
ters. The last thing farmers should
worry about is a reactionary trade and
policy decision made by the President,
whom most of the farmers supported.
Moreover, though farmers have been
patient holding out for the situation to
improve, each passing day that we fail
to take into consideration the interest
of American farmers only contributes
to a mounting problem that we must
not ignore any longer. Enough is
enough.
As the Representative of a geographi-
cally diverse district that encompasses
several rural communities, I fear what
a continued, retaliatory imposition of
tariffs on China would mean for the
farmers in my district: that this is
going to hurt.
Now, making a bad decision, Mr.
President, is understandable, but not
correcting it is untenable and
unfertile.
Last Friday, the President decided to
hit below the belt with his threats to
shut down the southern border with
Mexico. A border shutdown would
wreak havoc on the U.S. economy. I
didn’t say this. This comes from just
about every major economist in the
country.
A border shutdown is not in the best
interests of the Midwest or this coun-
try. This is another blow to our farm-
ers, and they cannot afford it. They
will be forced to tap out.
Missouri farmers depend on foreign
trade to market their crops. In my
State, we have an $80 billion industry
called agriculture. When it is dis-
rupted, the whole State is disrupted.
We have the largest export market,
after China and Canada, to Mexico. The
U.S. shipped $19 billion worth of agri-
cultural products to Mexico in 2018.
Mexico is our top market for corn and
our third largest market for U.S. beef.
Missouri pork producers cannot af-
ford the loss of the Mexican market on
top of all the financial losses from re-
taliatory tariffs from Mexico and
China.
The very threat of a border closure
creates uncertainty and depresses the
trade of $1.7 billion in goods and serv-
ices, daily, that cross the border.
Missouri’s economy has a direct con-
nection to Mexico through Kansas City
Southern Railroad.
Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by just
saying we have a 2,000-mile border be-
tween the United States and Mexico. If
we shut that down, we are shutting
down the U.S. economy.

NAZIS WERE EVIL SOCIALISTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, for 75 years, America has been the
greatest nation in world history. Amer-
ica’s standard of living is envied by
most. America’s military is un-
matched. America is a beacon of free-
dom for all.
Unfortunately, America’s founda-
tional principles are under attack—not
by a foreign foe, but from within our
own country.
Socialist Democrats oppose the rule
of law that is essential to peace and
prosperity by supporting open border
policies that consume hundreds of bil-
lions in tax dollars and kill tens of
thousands of Americans each year.
Socialist Democrats’ spending sprees
put America $22 trillion in debt, thus
risking a debilitating national insol-
vency and bankruptcy.
Socialist Democrats support dictato-
rial and guaranteed-to-fail socialism
over the free enterprise economy that
has created our prosperity.
If the Mueller report is accurate, for
2 years, socialist Democrats and fake
news media allies used the big lie prop-
aganda tactic to undermine our elec-
tions’ legitimacy and falsely accuse
President Trump of colluding with
Russia.
History’s most famous evil and hor-
rific use of big lie tactics is by the Na-
tional Socialist German Workers’
Party, or Nazis, for short.
Not surprisingly, socialist Democrats
and their fake news media allies re-
cently objected to my quoting Adolf

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2944 April 2, 2019
Hitler’s ‘‘Mein Kampf’’ to explain what
the big lie propaganda tactic is and
how horrific the consequences can be
for those seduced by it.
Germany’s Socialist Party’s big lie
killed tens of millions of people in the
Holocaust and World War II, making it
the most horrific and deadly big lie in
history.
Also, not surprisingly, today’s social-
ists tried to revise history by falsely
claiming the Nazis were not socialists.
Bunk.
Mr. Speaker, America can either
learn from history or be doomed to re-
peat it.
By way of background, freedom and
liberty are the essence of free enter-
prise, wherein supply and demand mar-
ket forces determine which goods and
services are offered and at what prices.
Citizens who produce goods and serv-
ices better, faster, or cheaper thrive,
and everyone benefits from that.
Conversely, socialism is the mortal
enemy of free enterprise. Socialist
economies reject liberty, freedom, and
market forces, artificially dictate eco-
nomic activity, and determine which
businesses and industries prosper and
which do not. In a fully socialist econ-
omy, government owns and controls all
means of production.
So was Germany’s Socialist Party so-
cialists? The founders thought so be-
cause they called themselves socialists.
They certainly acted like socialists.
Germany’s Socialist Party’s
foundational 25 point platform stated,
in part:
Plank 13: ‘‘We demand the national-
ization of all previous associated agen-
cies, trusts.’’
Plank 14: ‘‘We demand a division of
profits of all heavy industries.’’
Plank 16: ‘‘We demand the . . . imme-
diate communalization of the great
warehouses.’’
Plank 17: ‘‘We demand a land reform
. . . for the free expropriation of land
for the purposes of public utility.’’
Communalization, land seizure with-
out compensation, nationalization and
government ownership of industry—
those are all socialist policies.
Further, the German Socialist Party
hated capitalism and free enterprise.
Nazi propaganda posters stated: ‘‘The
maintenance of a rotten industrial sys-
tem has nothing do with nationalism. I
can love Germany and hate cap-
italism.’’
Nazi propaganda minister Joseph
Goebbels wrote: ‘‘In the final analysis,
it would be better for us to go down
with Bolshevism than live in eternal
slavery under capitalism.’’
Mr. Speaker, Germany’s socialist
Nazis are a heinous example of the
marriage between big lie propaganda
tactics and socialism, but they are not
alone. Soviet Union and Chinese-style
socialism also subjugated or
exterminated tens of millions of peo-
ple.
Mr. Speaker, America must learn
from history. Socialism must lose and
free enterprise must win if America is
to remain a free, prosperous, and great
nation.

HUMANITARIAN CRISIS CANNOT
BE SOLVED BY A WALL ALONE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise. I rise with love of coun-
try in mind and liberty and justice for
all in heart.
I rise to remind us of the words of the
great French intellectual, Voltaire,
who reminded us that those who can
make us believe absurdities can cause
us to commit atrocities.
Mr. Speaker, I have been to the bor-
der. I have seen the security people
who are there, the Border Patrol offi-
cers. They are victims, Mr. Speaker,
victims of policies that, unfortunately,
do not respect the humanity of many
people. I have seen the children
stacked in cages. I have seen the par-
ents grieving.
Mr. Speaker, I know why people are
fleeing the countries south of the bor-
der. They are doing so because they
are, literally, many of them, running
for their lives. They are seeking safe
harbor in the United States of America
because we have extended an informal
invitation by and through our Statue
of Liberty.
We have, with our words and our
deeds, said to the world that we are
people who you can trust and who you
can depend on.
Mr. Speaker, I rise with liberty and
justice for all in mind because those
who would want us to believe that ba-
bies who are coming here are an invad-
ing army, if you will, they are wrong.
Those babies are coming because their
mothers believe that they can find
safety in our country.
Mr. Speaker, would anybody deny
that a mother who would send her
child to this country or some distant
place, possibly understanding that the
child could be harmed along the way,
can anybody deny that this is being
done because that mother has such
great love for that child that she wants
her child to have the opportunity to
have life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness?
Can anybody deny that these parents
who come, traversing harm’s way, are
doing so because they are trying to
leave a circumstance that has greater
harm?
Mr. Speaker, I rise with the under-
standing that Voltaire was right. It is
an absurdity to believe that women
and children and people who are fleeing
harm’s way are invaders.
I also would remind us of other words
of Voltaire. He also reminded us that,
‘‘It is difficult to free fools from the
chains they revere.’’ I would not utilize
the word ‘‘fools,’’ but I will say that it
is difficult to free people from chains
that they revere. Those who want to
separate us from the rest of the world,
especially the world of color, they re-
vere these chains that bind and bond
them to this notion. I think it is going
to be difficult to separate them, but
not impossible.
I believe that people of goodwill can
always win and that we of goodwill
must continue to preach the message
and gospel of liberty and justice for all.
I believe that we can make a dif-
ference in the lives of people who we
will never meet and greet. Those per-
sons who are trying to get here will
probably never vote for me. There is no
reason for me to do this other than I
believe in my heart that an injustice is
being perpetrated at the border.
Mr. Speaker, it is my belief that this
problem at the border requires greater
scrutiny and greater attention from
the American people and from those of
us who represent them. It is my belief
that if we want to do something about
this problem, we have to acknowledge
that it is a humanitarian crisis that we
are dealing with and that the humani-
tarian crisis cannot be solved with a
wall alone.
We cannot conclude that, if we leave
the world alone, it will leave us alone.
We are a part of this great world of hu-
manity. There is but one race and that
is the human race. We must do our part
to protect all within the human race,
especially our neighbors to the south.

Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to express my strong support
for the reauthorization of the Violence
Against Women Act.
Since it was first enacted in 1994, the
Violence Against Women Act has saved
countless lives and supported millions
of domestic violence and assault vic-
tims and survivors by funding critical
programs.
In February 2019, the Violence
Against Women Act expired. This is
unacceptable. It is imperative that we
fully reauthorize the Violence Against
Women Act. A stopgap Violence
Against Women Act does not address
critical issues within the legislation
and would seriously impact the life-
saving programs needed across Indian
Country.
Domestic violence affects every com-
munity in America. Tribal commu-
nities, though, face it at an alarmingly
high rate. According to Federal data,
at least 55 percent of American Indian
and Alaska Native women have experi-
enced physical violence at an intimate
partner’s hands.
We are here to make visible the unac-
ceptable and glaring disparities that
women and families across Indian
Country face when it comes to vio-
lence, assault, and abuse. We are here
to demand action because there are
things we can and should do to help
survivors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2945
April 2, 2019
In 2013, the reauthorization of the Vi-
olence Against Women Act created spe-
cial domestic violence criminal juris-
diction. This was critical to holding
perpetrators accountable on Indian
Country, but it didn’t go far enough.
The special jurisdiction limits Tribes
to prosecuting only crimes committed
against intimate partners, not kids or
police officers.
As a former law enforcement officer
and homicide detective, I can tell you
that responding to these types of calls
was extremely and is extremely dan-
gerous for police officers. Within the
past 3 years alone, the Navajo Nation
has lost three officers responding to do-
mestic violence calls. We must honor
their sacrifice with action.
Further, these gaps in jurisdiction
put children who are victims or wit-
nesses to violence in harm’s way. It af-
fects families dramatically. It affects
our communities. It affects our coun-
try.
This reauthorization of the Violence
Against Women Act includes my legis-
lation, the Native Youth and Tribal Of-
ficer Protection Act. This lifesaving
provision would fix these jurisdictional
gaps and expand current law regarding
special jurisdiction. It would allow
Tribes to prosecute and convict non-In-
dian offenders who harm children and
law enforcement officers responding to
domestic violence cases, as any town
outside Indian Country can already do.
Few things have shaped my life more
than the 13 years I served as a police
officer. My first call as an officer in-
volved domestic violence. I still re-
member it and other domestic violence
and sexual assault cases. There are too
many to remember. Our society has to
change if we are to make life and our
families successful.
We must protect children and other
survivors of domestic violence and sex-
ual assault. I join my colleagues in de-
manding a full reauthorization of the
Violence Against Women Act. I am a
proud cosponsor of this legislation and
urge all my colleagues to support its
passage. It is long overdue.

PRAYER
Dr. Lora F. Hargrove, Mount Calvary
Baptist Church, Rockville, Maryland,
offered the following prayer:
Let us draw nigh unto God that God
may also draw nigh unto us.
O God, author of all mercy and the
provider of all peace, in times of uncer-
tain and sometimes unrelenting na-
tional and global difficulties, look with
favor upon these women and men who
seek to serve with integrity from the
people’s House and bless them.
As the diligent work to silence ideo-
logical stalemates, to give voice to
Ubuntu—shared humanity toward oth-
ers—concretize concerns for all Ameri-
cans, especially the multitude of the
marginalized.
Help us all to understand the clarion
call to be unified, not uniform; to em-
brace diversity, despite racial, reli-
gious, and gender differences, knowing
that difference is never synonymous
with deficience.
Grant that all who are downcast and
downtrodden be uplifted by Your uni-
fying and amazing grace.
We ask this in the name of the One
who is the creator of us all.
Amen.

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

WELCOMING DR. LORA F.
HARGROVE
The SPEAKER. Without objection,
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
TRONE) is recognized for 1 minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, it was
a true honor to hear the wisdom of Dr.
Lora Hargrove this afternoon. Her call
for unity, shared humanity, and peace
is perhaps more important today than
ever before.
Dr. Hargrove is a native of Balti-
more, Maryland, just like our distin-
guished Speaker. She holds a doctorate
in ministry from Wesley Theological
Seminary, and she is working towards
her second Ph.D. in African Diaspora
from Howard University.
Dr. Hargrove comes from a long line
of servant leaders. Her father, the late
Judge John R. Hargrove, Sr., was the
first Black Federal prosecutor in Balti-
more and the first Black deputy U.S.
attorney. Her mother, Shirley H. Har-
grove, was a teacher and guidance
counselor.
Dr. Hargrove now serves as interim
minister at Rockville’s Mount Calvary
Baptist Church, where my wife, June,
and I have seen her practice many
times what she preaches. From hosting
HBCU college fairs to finding shelter
for women and children, Dr. Hargrove
lifts up our community every day.
Thank you, Dr. Hargrove.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER
PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
CLARKE of New York). The Chair will
entertain up to 15 further requests for
1-minute speeches on each side of the

f
DEFENDING THE AFFORDABLE
CARE ACT
(Mrs. KIRKPATRICK asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speak-
er, Kerry from Tucson, Arizona, has a
daughter in middle school who has type
1 diabetes.
The countless doctor visits, the
fights with insurers and providers and
doctors and back again, and the ache of
watching her child struggle to be a nor-
mal kid on the playground is hard, but,
as Kerry said, the fear of not being able
to afford her daughter’s treatment is a
lot harder.
The Affordable Care Act saved
Kerry’s family. Before the ACA, there
were no legal protections for those
with preexisting conditions, and the
cost of coverage was simply
unaffordable.
President Trump continues his war
on healthcare.
I ask my colleagues: When can our
working families and mothers like
Kerry feel safe from the fear of losing
their healthcare? When can these fami-
lies come up for air from the medical
bills that drown them?
Arizonans and all Americans deserve
a country that is there for them with-
out question or condition. I will con-
tinue to defend the Affordable Care
Act, its protections, and lowering
healthcare costs for all families.

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, thus far, I have released five
transcripts from the Committee on the
Judiciary’s investigation into apparent
wrongdoing at the FBI and the Justice
Department. Today, I am releasing the
sixth.
The American people deserve trans-
parency. They deserve to know what
transpired at the highest levels of the
FBI and at the origin of the probe into
President Trump’s campaign.
Madam Speaker, I include the link
www.dougcollins.house.gov/priestap in
the RECORD so the American people can
review the transcripts of Bill Priestap’s
interview.
Out of an abundance of caution, this
transcript has a limited number of nar-
rowly tailored redactions related only
to confidential sources and methods,
nonpublic information about ongoing
investigations, and nonmaterial per-
sonal information.
I will continue to work to release as
many transcripts as possible. The
American people deserve the truth.
f
THE SKYROCKETING COST OF
INSULIN
(Ms. BARRAGÁN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today for my mother, my sister-in-
law, and the millions of Americans liv-
ing with diabetes.
Diabetes is an epidemic in which one
in five healthcare dollars in the United
States is spent caring for patients with
this disease.
Communities of color are dispropor-
tionately affected by the disease. I
know because, in my congressional dis-
trict, we have the highest rate of diabe-
tes, higher than any other congres-
sional district in the State of Cali-
fornia.
Those with diabetes use insulin to
maintain blood sugar levels. Without
it, it becomes a matter of life and
death. This is why I am especially ap-
palled at the skyrocketing cost of this
lifesaving drug.
At this very moment, the Committee
on Energy and Commerce is having an
oversight hearing about the rising cost
of insulin. Tomorrow, the whole com-
mittee will mark up legislation, which,
if passed, will help reduce the cost of
prescription drugs.
This should not be a partisan issue,
and I call on my Republican colleagues
and the President to work with us to
help all Americans and work for the
people.
f
UVA FINAL FOUR APPEARANCE
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate the Univer-
sity of Virginia Cavaliers, who ad-
vanced to the Final Four of the NCAA
Men’s Basketball Tournament last Sat-
urday night.
Down three points with less than 6
seconds left, the Cavaliers, with what
was one of the most exciting plays I
have seen—because I am an alum—
scored to tie the game and force over-
time. This gave them an extra 5 min-
utes of life, an opportunity they seized,
on the way to a historic victory.
It is as a proud alum that I congratu-
late Coach Tony Bennett and the team
on reaching the program’s first Final
Four since 1984. A tremendous accom-
plishment for sure, but there is still
business to attend to on the court.
I also wish the Cavaliers the best of
luck this weekend. For sure, I will be
here again in short order after they
beat Auburn and win the National
Championship game.
Go Hoos, and Wahoowa.
f
PROTECTING THE AFFORDABLE
CARE ACT
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to talk about America’s healthcare
system and the importance of pro-
tecting the Affordable Care Act.
Residents in my home State of Cali-
fornia benefited greatly from the ACA.
When it became law in 2010, California
was one of the first States to imple-
ment it. At that time, 22 percent of my
residents had no healthcare insurance
whatsoever and 17 percent were unin-
sured.
The ACA greatly decreased that
number by less than 10 percent, a big
difference, while also providing cov-
erage for those with preexisting condi-
tions, which we all feel strongly about.
Now the President wants to strike
down those protections and eliminate
the last benefits. That is wrong. These
repeated attempts to repeal the ACA
are irresponsible, especially when there
is no real proposal to replace it by the
President of the United States or my
Republican colleagues.
If he succeeds, one in seven people in
California will lose their healthcare.
That is a fact.
Yes, there are improvements that
can be made to the Affordable Care
Act, and we should address those defi-
ciencies, and that is what I am com-
mitted to doing. The Congress and the
administration should work together
to fix the law and to make it better.
f
INCREASING ACCESS TO QUALITY,
AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of the Protecting Pre-
Existing Conditions and Making
Healthcare More Affordable Act.
I am proud to cosponsor this legisla-
tion, which is more important than
ever following the administration’s
court filing last week that pushes for
the complete and total repeal of the Af-
fordable Care Act.
Now, I wasn’t in Congress when that
law was passed. I don’t think it is a
perfect law, but there are components
of it that are undeniably positive:
It is a good thing that people with
preexisting conditions can’t be dis-
criminated against by insurance com-
panies;
It is a good thing that young people
can stay on their parents’ insurance
until their 26th birthday;
It is a good thing that preventive
care, like mammograms and cancer
screenings, and even annual physicals,
can be covered without copay;
It is a good thing that millions of
people in our country that now have
insurance for the first time are able to
get the care they need.
Now, unfortunately, all of those posi-
tive steps are put in jeopardy as a con-
sequence of the administration’s court
filing.
Now, rather than unwinding the
progress that has been made, we are
proposing to build on the success of the
existing law. For example, we propose
an expansion of the tax credits avail-
able under the law, reducing cost for
low-income families and enabling more
middle-class families to be eligible for
assistance to make healthcare afford-
able.
This is the beginning of the effort on
healthcare, not the end. Folks in D.C.
shouldn’t be sabotaging the American
healthcare system; they should be
making it work for the people of Amer-
ica.
f
RETAIN THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT
(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, well,
the President says that Republicans
are ‘‘the party of healthcare.’’ I think
it would be more accurate to say that
they are the party of taking away your
healthcare.
The Trump administration is moving
to eliminate the Affordable Care Act in
its entirety, every provision, which
would mean millions of Americans
would lose health coverage.
Let’s remind ourselves what would
happen if the ACA were eliminated:
Millions of Americans with pre-
existing conditions, including 1.7 mil-
lion in Michigan, would be at the whim
of big insurance companies who once
again would be free to discriminate
against them because they are sick or
once had an illness;
Millions of Americans, including
690,000 Michiganders enrolled in the
Healthy Michigan Medicaid expansion,
would lose health insurance. If they
prevail, they lose health insurance;
Eliminating the ACA would also
hinder our ability to deal with the

HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT
WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS
(Mr. PHILLIPS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker,
while traveling recently through my
home State of Minnesota, I met a won-
derful couple in their early 60s. They
were both teachers who had dedicated
their professional lives to enriching
our community by educating our chil-
dren.
They had done everything right,
saved as much money as they could,
and it was time to retire, until the hus-
band was diagnosed with early-onset
Alzheimer’s. Now, the out-of-pocket
costs for his care will wipe out all of
their retirement savings—all of their
savings.
Madam Speaker, I ask: What is our
President thinking?
This is an all-too-common story
played out in blue and red districts
throughout our Nation. Yet, we have a
White House determined to wipe out
the Affordable Care Act. It is callous;
it is wrong; and it is unacceptable. It is
time for us to make the moral decision
to ensure that all Americans have ac-
cess to affordable, high-quality
healthcare, no matter their cir-
cumstances.
That is why we just introduced a bill
in the House, led by my Minnesota col-
league, ANGIE CRAIG, to reduce pre-
miums and lower healthcare costs.
That is why I am a cosponsor of Con-
gressman DOGGETT’s bill to make pre-
scription drugs more affordable.
There is hard work to be done to
make our health system work for all
Americans, and we are doing it in the
House.
I say to President Trump and my Re-
publican colleagues that it is not too
late to abandon this misguided effort
to dismantle the ACA and join us to
work on real solutions. That is what we
are sent here to do.
f
DON’T GET VOTED OFF THE IS-
LAND BECAUSE OF HEALTHCARE
COSTS
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Speaker, last week in Federal court,
President Trump radically expanded
his war on American’s healthcare, ask-
ing the court not only to strike down
protections for people with preexisting
conditions, but to eliminate every last
protection and benefit provided by the
ACA.
I am a two-time cancer survivor. Two
of my four kids have lived with Crohn’s
disease for 14 years. There is no way to
spin this. Without the protections of
the Affordable Care Act, my family
would be in big trouble.
If America’s healthcare system was a
reality TV show, under this President’s
mean-spirited, every-person-for-himself
approach, I guess my family would get
voted off the island because, with the
hand God dealt us, we simply cost too
much.
This week, the people’s House will
vote to make clear that we don’t be-
lieve in that vision of America, and we
will not stand idly by while Mr. Trump
does everything he can to take away
the protections and the benefits that
American families like mine depend
on.
Madam Speaker, I implore my Re-
publican colleagues to stand with us
and improve the ACA for the American
people.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
HEALTHCARE—REINSURANCE,
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, PRE-
SCRIPTION DRUGS
(Mrs. CRAIG asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, we
have an urgent problem that we must
immediately find common ground on
to solve. If healthcare isn’t affordable,
it is not accessible. That is why I led
the introduction of the State Health
Care Premium Reduction Act, a bill to
lower the cost of health insurance pre-
miums in the individual market by 10
percent, on average, across the coun-
try. But that is only part of the solu-
tion.
Fifty-one percent of nonelderly peo-
ple in my congressional district have a
preexisting condition. That is why it is
critical that we pass the bill that I
have cosponsored, the Protecting Pre-
Existing Conditions and Making Health
Care More Affordable Act of 2019.
I will fight this administration every
day if they roll back healthcare in this
country. It is not perfect, but we have
to put aside the petty politics of the
past and quit thinking that if we fix
our Nation’s healthcare, somehow we
are handing the other side a victory.
People across this country need our
help. They need us to fix the cost of
prescription drugs. They need us to un-
leash generic competition.
f
CONDEMN CRUSADE TO TAKE
AWAY HEALTHCARE
(Mr. ROUDA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, last
week, the President put a five-alarm
fire on American families by putting
the government’s weight behind a law-
suit designed to cripple many
healthcare protections. The ordinary
people whose lives will be upended by
this decision have been offered a raw
deal to blow up healthcare and fix it
later, but even that is a false promise.
There is no plan to help the 316,000
people with preexisting conditions in
coastal Orange County or the millions
of Americans across our country. There
has been no plan for 10 years.
We have to recognize that the inabil-
ity to pay healthcare expenses is the
leading cause of personal bankruptcy
in the United States and a leading
cause of homelessness.
I hope my Republican colleagues will
have the chance to show the American
people that Congress isn’t completely
without common sense and decency by
voting for our resolution Tuesday con-
demning this ideological crusade to
take away healthcare from millions of
needy American families.
f
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE
COVERAGE
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker,
today, I rise to highlight the need for
our country to finally achieve uni-
versal healthcare coverage.
As the wealthiest country in the
world, there is simply no excuse for us
to be the only developed country left
without universal healthcare. There
are a lot of different ways to achieve
universal healthcare, and I believe that
a public option is the best way for us to
get there. That is why I was pleased
yesterday to introduce the Medicare-X
Choice Act, which will finally bring our
country to universal healthcare cov-
erage.
My bill will combine Medicare physi-
cian networks and reimbursement
rates with ACA coverage standards to
create a new public option available to
all Americans. My bill would allow
those who are happy with their em-
ployer-provided insurance to keep it,
while offering another more affordable
coverage option to those in need.
With this bill, we are introducing
more choice and more competition to
the marketplace, starting in the places
that need it most, like rural areas with
provider shortages. This much-needed
competition will drive down costs for
everyone.
Our constituents expect us to take on
the big issues impacting their lives.
This should not be a partisan issue. We
must roll up our sleeves and get to
work so we can lower the cost of cov-
erage for all Americans.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, on
Monday, the Rules Committee met and
reported a rule, House Resolution 274.
It provides for the consideration under
closed rules for S.J. Res. 7, with 1 hour
of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on For-
eign Affairs, and for the consideration
of H. Res. 271, with 1 hour of debate
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of

It also provides suspension authority
for Thursday, April 4.
Madam Speaker, before I begin, I
want to recognize that today marks
the 230th anniversary of the Rules
Committee being formally constituted
for the first time.
Now, the Ways and Means Com-
mittee—which my Massachusetts
friend and colleague, RICHIE NEAL,
chairs—likes to point out that they are
the oldest standing committee in the
House. While that is true, I would like
to remind my friends that the Rules
Committee is the oldest committee in
the House, being first created on this
day in 1789 as a select committee. So it
is especially appropriate that we are on
the floor today to do some important
work before us.
For the record, Madam Speaker, the
Ways and Means Committee can cele-
brate their 230th anniversary on July
24.
Now that I have cleared that up, the
first measure included in this rule is
S.J. Res. 7, and we are taking action on
this because Yemen is in crisis. In a
country of roughly 28 million people,
an estimated 22 million of them are in
need of humanitarian assistance.
That is 75 percent of the population
facing famine, disease, and displace-
ment. Half the country is at risk of
starvation.
The famine and disease facing chil-
dren is particularly sobering. Save the
Children estimates that as many as
85,000 children under the age of 5 have
died because of hunger and disease
since 2015.
All told, this is one of the world’s
worst humanitarian crises, the site of
the fastest growing cholera epidemic
ever recorded and the biggest food
emergency on the planet.
Yet, it wasn’t caused by some natural
disaster. It is entirely man-made, the
result of a Saudi-led military conflict.
Seemingly every day, bombs fall on
weddings, hospitals, buses, and homes,
as civilian neighborhoods are regularly
targeted.
This is not some abstract war hap-
pening half a world away. In fact, the
United States is intimately involved in
this conflict. We have supported the
Saudi reign of terror by providing lo-
gistics, intelligence, ground support,
and midair fueling of bombers. Vir-
tually all the bombs that fall on
Yemen say ‘‘Made in the United States
of America.’’
Make no mistake, Madam Speaker,
the United States is involved in a war
in Yemen today. But if our constitu-
ents look through the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD, they wouldn’t find a vote au-
thorizing it. That is because this body
abdicated its responsibility to declare
war when it began 4 years ago.
b 1230
Now, we took one of our most sacred
responsibilities and handed it to the
executive branch. It is not the first
time we have done it, but it is becom-
ing a habit around here. We first let
the Bush administration decide the
contours of our involvement abroad,
and that continues through the Trump
administration today.
If that wasn’t outrageous enough,
past Republican Congresses used every
legislative trick in the book to block
Members from even debating our role
there. On two separate occasions, they
went so far as to strip War Powers Res-
olutions related to Yemen of their
privilege. It was unprecedented.
But when it comes to Saudi Arabia,
this administration and my Republican
friends were all too content to look the
other way when they murdered a Wash-
ington Post journalist. They lured him
into a consulate in Turkey, they mur-
dered him, and then they used a bone
saw to dismember him. We know, based
on our intelligence reports, that the
highest level of the Saudi Government
was involved in that terrible human
rights atrocity, and the Trump admin-
istration did nothing. They rational-
ized it. They justified it. They basi-
cally turned a blind eye.
When it comes to human rights, this
administration has abdicated its moral
authority. That should be of concern to
everybody in this Chamber, whether
you are Democrat or Republican, be-
cause if the United States stands for
anything, we need to stand out loud
and foursquare for human rights. If the
President of the United States and his
administration don’t want to do it,
then we should.
No Congress should be complicit in
abdicating our Article I constitutional
responsibility. Thankfully, this Demo-
cratic Congress is doing the opposite.
We are reasserting our power, and we
are taking a stand when it comes to
human rights.
Thanks especially to the dedication
of Speaker PELOSI, Chairman ENGEL,
Congressman RO KHANNA, Congress-
woman JAYAPAL, Congressman POCAN,
and the entire Congressional Progres-
sive Caucus, we are considering a bi-
partisan measure that makes clear it is
time for the United States’ involve-
ment in Yemen to end. No more ex-
cuses.
This is virtually identical to the res-
olution we passed in February. The dif-
ference this time is that this is the
first opportunity that this House has
had to send something on the war in
Yemen right to the President’s desk.
So I urge all of my colleagues: seize
this opportunity. We have a constitu-
tional responsibility and we have a
moral obligation to get this done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2949
April 2, 2019
Don’t let any legislative maneuvers
deter us from ending our Nation’s com-
plicity in this humanitarian catas-
trophe. Let’s pass this resolution free
of changes that would prevent it from
going right to the President.
Let me make that more clear: if we
change a single word, we will derail
this resolution.
Now, the second measure included in
this rule is H. Res. 271, in response to a
war of a different kind: the Republican
war on healthcare. The Trump Justice
Department recently moved in Federal
Court not only to strike down pre-
existing condition coverage under the
Affordable Care Act, but to overturn
this law completely.
If the President succeeds in Texas v.
U.S., the protections for preexisting
conditions will be gone. The Medicaid
expansion will be nullified. Insurance
premiums will skyrocket. I could go on
and on and on and on.
Striking down the Affordable Care
Act would be a tragedy felt by every
single American. We would return to
the days when our health insurance
marketplace was like the Wild West,
when insurers were free to decline or
limit coverage because someone had
acne, or received an organ transplant,
or even because they were a victim of
domestic violence. That is how messed
up our system was, and that is the sys-
tem that this President and many of
my colleagues want to return to.
Now, for the life of me, I cannot un-
derstand what President Trump and his
allies in Congress have against Ameri-
cans getting healthcare. For nearly a
decade now, they have worked end-
lessly to sabotage the Affordable Care
Act through Congress, the courts, and
administrative actions. Apparently,
they are not happy that 20 million peo-
ple have gained healthcare coverage
because of this law, or that 130 million
Americans with preexisting conditions
can get care. We should be celebrating
these advancements. But, instead,
some on the other side won’t be satis-
fied until the Affordable Care Act is re-
pealed completely.
Now, this Democratic majority has
taken a different course. On the very
first day of this Congress, we brought
the full weight of the House of Rep-
resentatives to bear in this lawsuit. As
a result, the House Counsel has already
intervened in this case to protect the
healthcare Americans depend on.
Now, this resolution is our chance to
speak with one voice against the ad-
ministration’s attempts to abolish the
ACA. I have seen my friends on the
other side issue sternly worded press
releases and strongly worded letters to
the administration. But now it is time
to back up words with votes, and then
I hope they will work with us moving
forward as this majority takes action
to reverse the administration’s
healthcare sabotage and strengthen
healthcare for every single American.
Madam Speaker, I believe that
healthcare ought to be a fundamental
right for every single person in this
country. It is unconscionable to me
that rather than working with us to
strengthen the Affordable Care Act and
rather than working with us to expand
healthcare protections, my Republican
friends have chosen instead to wipe it
out. I don’t know how anybody could
think like that. I don’t know what mo-
tivates the President of the United
States and some on the other side of
the aisle to move in that direction.
Now we are told by the President
that even though he doesn’t have a
plan to replace this, if he succeeds in
nulling and voiding the Affordable Care
Act, he said: Well, we will provide you
one in the year 2021.
So, Madam Speaker, the man who
has spent all of his time trying to rip
protections away from people with pre-
existing conditions, the person who
wants to not allow you to keep your
kids on their insurance until they are
26, the leader of our country who
doesn’t believe in capping insurance
when it comes to people with lifetime
illnesses, the person who doesn’t want
to lower the cost of prescription
drugs—I could go on and on and on and
on—says: I want to repeal it, I want it
gone, I want the courts to null and void
it; and then just trust me, and then we
will come up with some magical plan,
some secret plan, after the election.
I don’t think the American people
are going to fall for that kind of non-
sense, and they shouldn’t because
healthcare is not a Democratic issue or
a Republican issue. It is a moral issue.
It is not even an issue, it is a value
that all of us should share.
So I urge my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle to support us in sending a
message loud and clear to the adminis-
tration that we have had enough of
their attempts to sabotage the
healthcare bill, we have had enough of
their trying to take health insurance
away from the American people, and
that we are going to stand here and
make it very clear that we do believe
that everybody is entitled to good
healthcare in this country.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume, and I thank Mr. MCGOVERN for
yielding me the customary 30 minutes.
Madam Speaker, we are here again
considering one nonbinding resolution
and a second resolution that will never
become law. Both of these prevent us
from focusing on the real business of
Congress, which is to legislate.
The first, H. Res. 271, is a resolution
condemning the Trump administra-
tion’s recent position in the case of
Texas v. United States.
So let’s revisit that for a minute. Re-
publicans are supportive of protecting
access to health insurance for individ-
uals with preexisting conditions. This
resolution today will not advance the
development of any policies to improve
healthcare for the American people.
There are options that the Democrats
could have brought to the floor to
lower healthcare costs and increase ac-
cess to care; such legislation would in-
deed be worthy of our time. But, in-
stead, we are debating expressions that
basically amount to political pos-
turing.
The first vote the Republicans called
this year was a motion to require legis-
lation protecting individuals with pre-
existing conditions. Surprisingly, the
Democrats voted against that previous
question. In 2017, as part of the pro-
posed replacement for the Affordable
Care Act, Republicans included legisla-
tion that would have preserved access
for those with preexisting conditions.
Speaker PELOSI has already inter-
vened on behalf of the House in Texas
v. United States. While the Depart-
ment of Justice has weighed in, the de-
partment is not litigating the case. As
with every other legal case, this will
play out in the courts. If Congress
must act following the final legal deci-
sion, certainly we stand ready to do so.
In fact, if the Democrats wanted to
void this case, they know their options.
They could repeal the individual man-
date or they could reinstitute the tax
on the individual mandate or they
could provide a severability clause that
was somehow left out when the Afford-
able Care Act was passed the first time.
But we have seen them do none of
those options.
The legal process will take time, and
no Americans will lose access to their
healthcare while the legal process is
being heard. Unlike the case of Texas
v. United States—which we know will
not affect coverage because the judge
in that case has issued a stay—individ-
uals covered by what are known as as-
sociation health plans may actually
lose their coverage due to uncertainty
in the legal outcome of that case. For
last week, a Federal judge in the case
of the State of New York, et al. v. De-
partment of Labor, last week a Federal
judge ruled that the Department of La-
bor’s final rule on association health
plans was not legal.
Association health plans provide em-
ployers who otherwise might struggle
to provide health insurance for their
employees to access the group market
through an association, based either on
geography or a line of business. The
Washington Post recently reported
that there are initial signs that asso-
ciation health plans are ‘‘offering gen-
erous benefits and premiums lower
than found in the ObamaCare market-
places.’’
Association health plans have pro-
vided additional choices for Americans
seeking innovative healthcare options,
but these choices may soon disappear
as a result of the lawsuit State of New
York, et al. v. the Department of
Labor.
The Democrats are using the case of
Texas v. United States to delay ex-
plaining their real ideas. Their real
idea is a one-size-fits-all healthcare.
The so-called Medicare for All would be
a terrifying reality for our Nation. The
Democrats’ Soviet style, government-

run, single-payer healthcare bill would
not provide access to quality
healthcare for Americans. Instead, it
would lead to a massive tax increase,
eliminate private insurance, and bank-
rupt the already dwindling Medicare
trust fund.
Constituents in my district back in
Texas are struggling to afford their
health insurance under the Affordable
Care Act, and I am certain that we are
not the only ones suffering from high
premiums and very high deductibles.
Madam Speaker, what good is health
insurance if you are afraid to use it be-
cause you can’t afford your deductible?
This is an issue that I would actually
like to see us tackle. But I am con-
fident that a government-run, single-
payer system would only further dete-
riorate our Nation’s healthcare.
As the son of a physician who chose
to leave Canada because of their sys-
tem of socialized medicine, I worry
that the central state control of
healthcare would further damage the
doctor-patient relationship. As a physi-
cian, I do not believe that the govern-
ment should hinder a doctor’s ability
to act in the best interest of his or her
patient. I wish the concept of govern-
ment dictating a physician’s practice
and decisions was unthinkable, but I
find myself here today having to
deconstruct the idea of further govern-
ment control of healthcare.
The House Democratic proposal
would implement a global budget, and
once that has been set, hospitals and
institutions would be required to stick
to that for all outpatient and inpatient
treatment.
What happens if the budget runs out?
Are the patients simply told: Sorry,
we ran out of money, you may try
again next year?
Today we should be focusing on the
parts of the health insurance market
that are working for Americans. For
example, 71 percent of Americans are
satisfied with their employer-spon-
sored health insurance. This provides
robust protections for individuals with
preexisting conditions under ERISA
law—a 1970 law, not the 2010 Affordable
Care Act. Quite simply, the success of
employer-sponsored insurance is not
worth wiping out for single-payer
healthcare.
Since President Trump took office—
and this is important—since the Presi-
dent took office, the number of Ameri-
cans in employer-sponsored health cov-
erage has increased.
How much has that increased?
I can’t precisely tell you because our
Congressional Budget folks have not
seen fit to give us new coverage num-
bers.
But since the President took office,
how many people are employed that
were previously unemployed?
The number is somewhere between 3
and 6 million, and a significant number
of those individuals have employer-
sponsored health insurance who had no
insurance before.
b 1245
The coverage numbers under Presi-
dent Trump, if the story is ever told,
have gone up. Today, there is a greater
percentage of Americans in employer-
sponsored health coverage than at any
time since the year 2000. That is why it
is astonishing that House Democrats
would want to abolish that insurance
option entirely.
Instead of building on the success of
our existing health insurance frame-
work, Democrats’ radical single-payer,
government-run policy would simply
tear it down. It would eliminate em-
ployer-sponsored health insurance,
eliminate all private insurance, elimi-
nate Medicaid, and eliminate CHIP.
Existing Medicare beneficiaries
would not be exempt from harm, as the
policy would raid the Medicare trust
fund, which is already slated to go
bankrupt in 2026.
Our Nation’s seniors count on the ex-
istence of Medicare for their retire-
ment healthcare needs. They have paid
into it their entire working lives. How
are we supposed to inform them that
not only do the Democrats want to en-
danger their access to Medicare serv-
ices, but, unbelievably, they will want
to increase their taxes also?
There is no question that this policy
could be catastrophic for America’s pa-
tients today and for generations to
come.
At least now there is some degree of
honesty. Remember, a previous admin-
istration said, if you like your doctor,
you can keep your doctor. Now at least
there is some degree of honesty.
You can’t keep your doctor. You
can’t keep your insurance. You can’t
keep your personal liberty. You get
nothing. Effectively, it would end all
the parts of our healthcare system that
are, in fact, working for the American
people.
Quite simply, single-payer healthcare
would be another attempt at a one-
size-fits-all approach to healthcare. We
know this: Americans are all different.
A universal healthcare plan will not
meet the varying needs of each and
every one of us as individuals. Single-
payer is not one-size-fits-all. It is real-
ly one-size-fits-no-one.
Again, to restate the obvious: Since
the beginning of this Congress, we have
heard it. Through the last Congress, we
heard it. Republicans support protec-
tions for individuals with preexisting
conditions.
Instead of spending our time here
today worrying about the judicial
branch, we could focus on our job as
members of the legislative branch. We
should be actively working to better
our healthcare system, not spending
time taking votes that will fail to ac-
complish any real objective.
Madam Speaker, the second resolu-
tion included in this rule directs the
removal of the United States Armed
Forces from hostilities in the Republic
of Yemen that have not been author-
ized by Congress.
We considered this resolution once
before. At that time, Republicans suc-
cessfully passed a motion to recommit
that declared the House’s opposition to
anti-Semitism. However, this version
of the bill does not include that impor-
tant provision, and we are again debat-
ing legislation that is, in fact, based on
a false premise.
The resolution is fundamentally
flawed. United States forces are not en-
gaged in hostilities between the Saudi-
led coalition and the Iranian-backed
Houthi forces in Yemen. Previously,
the United States was providing midair
refueling to Saudi Arabia but ceased
this assistance in November 2018. The
United States continues to provide lim-
ited intelligence-sharing and limited
logistics support, which does not
amount to engagement in hostilities.
The Trump administration is focused
on countering al-Qaida in the Arabian
Peninsula and the Islamic State, miti-
gating the humanitarian crisis in
Yemen and assisting our allies.
The United States does not com-
mand, coordinate, accompany, nor par-
ticipate in counter-Houthi operations
or any hostilities other than those di-
rected at al-Qaida and the Islamic
State.
I might, here, just add: Those activi-
ties against the Islamic State have
been significantly successful over the
last 2 years.
This resolution sets a dangerous
precedent. America has a security
agreement with Saudi Arabia, just as
we do with 117 other countries, includ-
ing our NATO allies Canada, Australia,
South Korea, and Israel. If this resolu-
tion were to become law, it could set a
precedent that could prevent us from
assisting allies and prevent us from
meeting our treaty obligations. Rather
than condemning a type of assistance
that is no longer being provided by the
United States, we should be finding
ways to aid the millions of Yemenis at
risk of starving to death.
Limiting how our forces can engage
in the region will only further exacer-
bate this conflict and not help bring it
to a conclusion.
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to
the rule, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I have to give the
Republicans credit for one thing. They
are consistent on the issue of
healthcare, in trying to avoid talking
about the issue at hand.
We are not talking about universal
healthcare, although I support uni-
versal healthcare. We are not talking
about Medicare for All, although I per-
sonally support Medicare for All. We
are not talking about the Canadian
system or the German system or any
other system.
We are talking about preventing this
President and his Republican allies
from null and voiding the Affordable
Care Act, thereby taking away
healthcare protections for every single
American. We are talking about pre-
venting the President from throwing

tens of millions of people off health in-
surance. We are talking about pro-
tecting the over 100 million people in
this country who have preexisting con-
ditions. That is what we are talking
about.
I loved it when the gentleman from
Texas said that the first vote that the
Republicans asked for in this Congress
was a procedural motion to protect
people with preexisting conditions.
Does the gentleman not know that peo-
ple with preexisting conditions already
have protections under the Affordable
Care Act?
I mean, it sounds to me—and it
seemed to me at the time—that that
Republican procedural vote was about
covering your rear and not about seri-
ous legislating, about trying to get the
American people to believe that we
really do care about healthcare and we
really do care about protecting people
with preexisting conditions, even
though we all know here that that is
just not the case.
When I hear the gentleman say that
the Republicans care deeply about peo-
ple’s healthcare and want to make sure
that everybody gets coverage, it is just
not true. The reason I say that so em-
phatically is because I have been
around here for the last few years, and
I have watched the dozens of votes that
the Republicans have brought up, one
after another after another after an-
other after another, to repeal
healthcare protections for people in
this country without proposing an al-
ternative.
Now, the President is saying: Trust
us.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD a Politico article that just ap-
peared that is entitled ‘‘Trump punts
health care until after 2020.’’
[From POLITICO, April 1, 2019]
TRUMP PUNTS HEALTH CARE UNTIL AFTER
2020
(By Quint Forgey and John Bresnahan)
JUST LAST WEEK THE PRESIDENT HAD SEEMED
TO GO ALL IN ON A NEW EFFORT TO WIPE OUT
OBAMACARE
President Donald Trump signaled Monday
that congressional Republicans would wait
until after the 2020 elections to vote on a
GOP replacement for Obamacare—putting
off a presumably savage legislative battle on
a hot-button campaign issue until after his
re-election bid.
‘‘Everybody agrees that ObamaCare
doesn’t work. Premiums & deductibles are
far too high—Really bad HealthCare! Even
the Dems want to replace it, but with Medi-
care for all, which would cause 180 million
Americans to lose their beloved private
health insurance,’’ the president tweeted.
‘‘The Republicans . . . are developing a
really great HealthCare Plan with far lower
premiums (cost) & deductibles than
ObamaCare,’’ Trump continued. ‘‘In other
words it will be far less expensive & much
more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be
taken right after the Election when Repub-
licans hold the Senate & win . . . back the
House.’’
Trump claimed that the as-yet-unseen Re-
publican proposal ‘‘will be truly great
HealthCare that will work for America,’’
writing online that ‘‘Republicans will always
support Pre-Existing Conditions.’’
The unexpected string of tweets added
drama to a week that has seen Obamacare
return to the fore as a policy issue.
The president’s pledge comes days after his
Justice Department endorsed a federal court
ruling to eliminate the Affordable Care Act
in its entirety, moving to invalidate the
landmark health care law despite objections
within Trump’s orbit from Health and
Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and At-
torney General William Barr. The ruling by
District Judge Reed O’Connor had suggested
that the Obamacare statute, which has
passed muster with the Supreme Court, was
actually wholly unconstitutional.
The president appeared on Capitol Hill the
next day, saying that the Republican Party
‘‘will soon be known as the party of health
care.’’
Trump’s call to again put Obamacare re-
peal on the table for Hill Republicans was
seen as a potential disaster-in-the making by
GOP leaders, who knew their incumbents
and candidates were badly hurt by it last No-
vember. And it was an invitation to Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) to pound home the
issue once more, as she plans to do with a
House vote this week condemning the admin-
istration’s decision not to defend Obamacare
in court.
Trump’s efforts to eradicate Obamacare
have also endangered some of the adminis-
tration’s health initiatives, such as lowering
prices for prescription drugs and combating
opioid abuse and HIV.
In public and private, Republican leaders
made clear that they didn’t want anything
to do with the president’s most recent ma-
neuver. They begged Trump to back down
and made their displeasure known to other
administration officials, as well.
GOP lawmakers even took the position
that if Trump wanted to lay out his own
health care proposal, then they would be
willing to look at it. But Senate Repub-
licans—facing a tough electoral fight to
maintain their majority in 2020—have re-
fused to sign on to a new administration
drive before seeing the specifics, giving them
room to disavow any Trump proposal if it
hinders their own political outlook.
‘‘I look forward to seeing what the presi-
dent is proposing and what he can work out
with the speaker,’’ Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell (R–Ky.) said in a brief
interview Thursday, adding: ‘‘I am focusing
on stopping the Democrats’ ‘Medicare for
None’ scheme.’’
McConnell is up for re-election this cycle,
as are vulnerable GOP incumbents including
Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins
of Maine, who said she doesn’t want the Jus-
tice Department to push to strike down
Obamacare.
The Affordable Care Act has been a thorn
in the side of Republicans since it was en-
acted in 2010. After the GOP took back the
House in the midterm elections that year,
GOP lawmakers repeatedly passed legisla-
tion designed to repeal Obamacare.
Once Trump was elected president on a
promise of different and better health care
options, Republicans seemed on the path to
finally scrapping the law, only to see a 2017
‘‘skinny repeal’’ effort fail unexpectedly in
the Senate. That attempt collapsed when Ar-
izona Sen. John McCain—upset with the ir-
regular way the legislation was being han-
dled—stunned his colleagues by voting
against it.
Mr. MCGOVERN. The President says:
Repeal everything, and then we will
share our secret plan after the election.
Give me a break. The bottom line is
that the American people want us to be
on their side, not on the side of big
health insurance corporations, not on
the side of big drug companies. They
want us to be on their side.
It wasn’t too long ago when people
would be provided insurance that
didn’t cover anything. It was junk in-
surance. There are people on the Re-
publican side and people in this White
House who are eager to get back to
those bad old days.
Stop trying to take away people’s
healthcare. Stop trying to get in bed
with corporate interests that basically
are fighting every attempt to make
sure that people have access to good,
quality care in this country.
By the way, if they repealed the Af-
fordable Care Act, that repeals essen-
tial benefits protections, which guar-
antee that every insurance company
has to provide you coverage when you
get sick. That wasn’t always the case.
This is a ridiculous fight that we are
having here. I cannot believe, after the
midterm elections, after it was made
crystal clear by the American people to
the Republicans that they wanted no
part of their effort to take away
healthcare in this country, that here
we are doing it all again.
Now, maybe they didn’t intend it this
way. The President wasn’t on message
and came out for repealing the Afford-
able Care Act outright, and now they
have to kind of scramble to try to,
again, cover their rears. That is what
is happening here.
It is really disillusioning, I think, for
people who are observing these pro-
ceedings that we are back again fight-
ing over whether or not people are en-
titled to good healthcare, whether peo-
ple are entitled to protections under
our healthcare laws.
I think this is a ridiculous fight for
the Republicans to be waging. But if
they want to fight it, they own it. I

American people are having none of it.
Madam Speaker, on the war in
Yemen, we cannot wait. The starving
children in Yemen cannot wait on this
President or on my Republican col-
leagues to do the right thing.
Just to highlight how bad the war is,
here are a few statistics. I noticed the
gentleman from Texas barely talked
about how horrific the situation is in
Yemen, but let me give you a few sta-
tistics.
Madam Speaker, 130 children under 5
die each day from hunger and disease
as a result of this war. The number of
cholera cases in Yemen is 1 million.
You heard that right. This is the larg-
est cholera outbreak in recent history.
Finally, 3-year-olds in Yemen have
lived through 18,000 air raids already.
As I mentioned in my opening state-
ment, the bombs that are dropping on
civilian populations say ‘‘Made in the
United States of America.’’ All of us
should be outraged by that, and not
only by the Saudi Government’s behav-
ior in Yemen, but the Saudi Govern-
ment’s behavior in general.
Yet, what is the response by this ad-
ministration and their Republican al-
lies? Send Saudi Arabia more weapons.

H2952 April 2, 2019
Sell them more weapons. Turn a blind
eye to what is going on in Yemen. Let’s
make believe that the murder of Wash-
ington Post journalist Jamal
Khashoggi never happened.
Again, we need to stand firmly on the
side of human rights.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself 3 minutes.
Madam Speaker, here is one of the
uncomfortable truths of the Affordable
Care Act: Under the law, every Member
of Congress was supposed to be covered
under the Affordable Care Act. Obvi-
ously, the pay and benefits of a Mem-
ber in Congress exceed the subsidy lim-
its, so these would be unsubsidized
healthcare.gov policies. But then-
Speaker of the House John Boehner,
then-Leader of the United States Sen-
ate Harry Reid, and President Obama
himself all intervened. They were fear-
ful that Members of Congress might
leave.
There might be a brain drain in Con-
gress—if such a thing was, in fact, pos-
sible—if Members of Congress were re-
quired to put their health insurance
under the Affordable Care Act, so they
created an exception for Members of
Congress, and Members of Congress
only. They are the only people in the
United States who can do this. There is
a tax-free subsidy that a Member of
Congress can walk into the D.C. ex-
change and get their coverage in the
D.C. exchange.
I rejected that option because: Num-
ber one, I didn’t think it was right.
Number two, I didn’t think it was
legal. I thought it was going to be
taken away from us. Apparently, no
one else shared my concern because it
still exists.
It does make me wonder why we
would not offer a health reimburse-
ment account, and I have brought this
up several times in committee, where
that same tax-free subsidy could be
available to any American to walk into
a health insurance plan of their choos-
ing. Why not give the people of the
country what Members of the Congress
so generously bestowed upon them-
selves?
I didn’t take the option to go into
the D.C. exchange. I didn’t take the op-
tion of the tax-free subsidy that went
along with it. I bought an unsubsidized
health insurance plan in
healthcare.gov, signed up for it October
1, 2012. Many of you may remember
that. We were in the process of shut-
ting the government down at the time.
It was in all the papers.
I started that process October 1, 2012.
The check cleared the middle of Janu-
ary 2013. I went that entire time not
knowing if I would have health insur-
ance in healthcare.gov the next year
because I couldn’t get an answer to any
questions.
You couldn’t call the people at
healthcare.gov. You would try, and you
would be put on hold. You would stay
on hold for a long period of time. You
would eventually get to talk to a per-
son. You would get cut off. You would
have to start all over at the beginning.
It was a miserable process.
The point is, Members of Congress
should have gone through that. We
should have had to deal with what we
pushed off on the American people, at
least those people in the individual
market.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
b 1300
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Let me just say you have got to love
the Republicans. I mean, they have
been in charge of this House for 8 years
previously. They were in charge of the
entire government the previous 2
years. They had the House, the Senate,
and the White House. They didn’t even
need a supermajority in the United
States Senate to be able to get what-
ever they wanted through, and they
couldn’t do it.
So the bottom line is this: You had
your chance. The American people re-
jected your attempt to take away
healthcare from millions of people. The
American people believe people with
preexisting conditions ought not to be
discriminated against by insurance
companies, and so they are having
none of what you are selling here.
So you can make excuses all you
want, but, unfortunately for the coun-
try, you were in charge of the House,
the Senate, and the White House for
the previous 2 years.
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield
4 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. KHANNA), who has been a
leader on the issue of Yemen, and I
commend him for his efforts.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I
thank Chairman MCGOVERN for his
leadership in finally bringing up for a
vote this resolution on Yemen and for
the terrific people on his team, Don
Sisson; on Speaker PELOSI’s team,
Keith Stern, and Shuwanza Goff; and
on Majority Leader HOYER’s team, who
finally allowed for a vote, with the
work of Keane Bhatt and Geo Saba.
Let me explain why this matters. As
the chairman alluded to, there are 14
million people in Yemen who currently
face the possibility of famine—14 mil-
lion.
I was with Martin Griffiths, the Spe-
cial Envoy to the United Nations,
about 2 weeks ago, and he said, if we do
not act in the next couple of months,
that situation will become irreversible.
The explanation for this famine is
pretty simple. The gentleman from
Texas said we need to get more aid in
there. I respect that, sir, but the prob-
lem is that the Saudis have a blockade
on Yemen; they are not allowing the
aid to get in. Every day we wait, it
makes it harder for us to reverse the
famine.
So the solution is very simple: We
need to have the Saudis lift the block-
ade and let food and medicine get to
the people who need it to prevent the
largest humanitarian crisis and the
largest famine the world has ever seen.
Now, the gentleman from Texas said
that the administration has already
stopped the refueling, and in that, he is
actually correct. The administration
has stopped the refueling. But the rea-
son they stopped the refueling is pre-
cisely because Congress acted, because
the Senate passed the War Powers Res-
olution.
All we are asking to happen now is to
codify that policy so that the refueling
doesn’t begin again. That is why this
shouldn’t be a partisan issue. The
President should want to sign this War
Powers Resolution.
The gentleman from Texas said, well,
what difference will it make if we have
already stopped? The difference this
will make is sending a clear, unambig-
uous message to the Saudis that they
can no longer continue a policy of in-
tentional cruelty, of trying to have a
nation, through starvation, submit to
their will. That is why this is a bipar-
tisan issue. If we pass this, then that
message will be heard by the Saudis,
and that is why we had bipartisan sup-
port in the Senate and in the House for
this resolution.
The gentleman from Texas said, well,
this is going to hurt our relationships
with Israel or other allies. That is just
false. That is just false.
The amendment, the Buck amend-
ment, that was in our resolution, or
the amendment that is in the Senate
resolution, makes it clear that we still
can have intelligence sharing with any
ally and does not touch any of our
treaties.
People often say why am I so pas-
sionate that, of all the issues, I decided
to take up Yemen in my first term. I
will tell you why.
In 1943, there was a famine in West
Bengal; 3 million people perished. My
grandfather was in jail in 1943 in India
when that famine took place. And
there was indifference—indifference—
by the British Government. They let 3
million people die.
As the United States, we should not
allow for another famine, and we
should do everything in our power, as a
House, to stop it.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. BRADY), the Republican
leader of the second oldest committee
in the United States Congress, the
Committee on Ways and Means.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I
thank Mr. BURGESS for his leadership
on healthcare in so many ways.
Madam Speaker, embarrassingly de-
signed and hastily written by our
Democratic colleagues, the Affordable
Care Act, from day one, has come
under legal and public scrutiny, and for
obvious reasons. This disastrous
healthcare experiment, written behind
closed doors and stuffed with special

interest giveaways, has driven up
healthcare costs for millions of work-
ing families so high that more Ameri-
cans eligible for the Affordable Care
Act have rejected it than have chosen
it.
Now, as ObamaCare’s ever-increasing
failures continue to find their way into
our courts, Democrats are asking us to
condemn the Justice Department’s
handling of this process.
No matter how Democrats try to
frame this stunt, the left is misleading
the American people with this political
and partisan move. The continuation,
regrettably, of falsehoods that Demo-
crats continue to elevate in order to
protect this unconstitutional law is
really a disservice to the Americans
and the patients who hope to have af-
fordable care. We can and must do bet-
ter as we work to protect patients and
lower healthcare costs.
Madam Speaker, the truth is Repub-
licans, creators of the children’s
healthcare program; creators of part D,
the Medicare prescription drugs for
seniors; creators of Medicare Advan-
tage, are committed to improving our
healthcare system.
If the Court strikes down the Afford-
able Care Act, Republicans will act to
protect those with preexisting condi-
tions. We will work to make healthcare
more affordable, guaranteeing that
folks can see local doctors or go to
their local hospitals, and we will pre-
serve other important provisions, such
as no lifetime limits and allowing kids
to stay on their parents’ plans till age
26. These are shared priorities that pa-
tients and families deserve to have se-
cured.
If our Democratic colleagues who
drafted this flawed law want to join
Republicans, why not start fresh, this
time, both parties working together to
pass a law that is truly constitutional,
that actually lowers costs and that will
actually protect patients? We welcome
that conversation with open arms.
So I am proud to join with my col-
league, the Republican leader of the
House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, GREG WALDEN, to introduce a
resolution that calls for this Congress
to work together to do just that, be-
cause one thing is crystal clear: Repub-
licans won’t let the courts take away
preexisting protections or let Demo-
crats take away your health plan at
work.
I strongly urge all my colleagues to
vote ‘‘no’’ on this political stunt so
that we can actually start working to-
gether toward making our healthcare
system more convenient and more af-
fordable for families across this coun-
try.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I have great respect for the gen-
tleman from Texas, the former chair of
the Ways and Means Committee. But I
just want to remind my colleagues
again that my Republican friends have
been in charge of this institution for 8
years. They were in charge for 2 years
of the House, the Senate, and the Pres-
idency, and they showed us what they
were about.
The gentleman says that they are not
going to let the courts take away pro-
tections for people with preexisting
conditions. Well, my Republican
friends tried to do that on dozens of oc-
casions. They brought legislation to
the floor that would have ripped pro-
tections away from people with pre-
existing conditions. That is their
record. It is there for anybody to see.
Now they are saying: ‘‘Oh, we are
now for protecting people with pre-
existing conditions’’? Their whole ex-
istence in the majority has been about
taking protections away from people.
Give me a break. I mean, people know
what is going on here.
I appreciate the resolution that the
gentleman wants to offer to say we all
should work together. Look, I am
happy to work with my Republican
friends to find ways to improve protec-
tions for people.
But I want to remind them, when
they were in the majority, they didn’t
want anything to do with us because
we wanted to protect people’s
healthcare. We wanted to protect peo-
ple with preexisting conditions. We
wanted to make sure that parents
could keep their kids on their insur-
ance until they were 26. We wanted to
lower the cost of prescription drugs.
We wanted to put a cap on people with
chronic illnesses so that they wouldn’t
go bankrupt. We wanted to make sure
that insurance companies had to offer
you real protections. We had essential
benefit protections there.
So we are happy to build on that.
What we are not happy to do is to work
with them to take these things away,
and that is what their leadership has
been all about for 8 years in the House.
And then when they controlled the
House, the Senate, and the White
House, that is what they tried to do.
Thankfully, some thoughtful Repub-
licans in the Senate didn’t go along
with it, so they didn’t get their way.
And now they are trying to use the
courts to try to undermine what this
body has done.
Madam Speaker, let me inquire of
the gentleman from Texas how many
more speakers he has.
Mr. BURGESS. I have as many as I
need.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Okay. Then I will
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. It will be me.
Mr. MCGOVERN. We were expecting
one more speaker, but she didn’t show
up. If the gentleman is ready to close,
I am ready to close.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to move a resolution
that reinforces our long-held views
that every American should have pre-
existing condition protections.
On the opening day of the 116th Con-
gress, House Republicans brought a
measure to the floor that called on
lawmakers to legislate on locking in
protections for patients with pre-
existing conditions. Unfortunately, in
a fit of partisanship, the Democrats
blocked this effort.
If the Democrats were serious, they
would take up legislation immediately
to protect patients with preexisting
conditions. Instead, Democrats are try-
ing to score political points.
Our position is simple and clear: Re-
publicans stand ready to protect those
with preexisting conditions in a man-
ner that will withstand judicial scru-
tiny. This is why, if the previous ques-
tion is defeated, House Republicans
will move a resolution that:
Maintains that no American should
have their health insurance taken
away or lose protections for pre-
existing conditions due to the Demo-
crats in Congress enacting an unconsti-
tutional law;
Instructs Congress and the Trump
administration to immediately ask the
Court for a stay in this decision;
Guarantees that no American citizen
can be denied health insurance or cov-
erage or charged more due to previous
illness or health status;
Includes commonsense consumer pro-
tections;
Provides more choice and affordable
coverage than the Affordable Care Act;
Lowers prescription drug prices for
patients;
Strengthens Medicare for current and
future beneficiaries; and
Rejects the Democrats’ radical, one-
size-fits-all, government-run
healthcare that would outlaw the em-
ployer-based coverage of more than 150
million Americans.
Finally, it is important to note that
Texas v. the United States, the case
that is working its way through the
courts, did not immediately end
ObamaCare and will not affect insur-
ance coverage or premiums for cal-
endar year 2019. Several legal steps re-
main before the courts reach a final
conclusion.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to include the text of my
amendment in the RECORD, along with
extraneous material, immediately
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas?
There was no objection.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, if
the gentleman is agreeable, I am pre-
pared to close.
So, in closing, while Republicans
stand ready to legislate, we are again
considering unnecessary resolutions.
The first seeks to condemn the position
of the Department of Justice in Texas
v. the United States, the case in which
the Department of Justice is not a
party.
As I have stated several times, Re-
publicans support protecting coverage

for preexisting conditions. I would hope
we could work together to find a way
to make health insurance affordable
for all Americans rather than consid-
ering a divisive messaging resolution.
The resolution to remove the United
States Armed Forces from hostilities
in Yemen is not only unnecessary, but
may prevent future assistance for our
allies.
b 1315
The brave men and women who are
assisting Saudi Arabia in the fight
against al-Qaida and the Islamic State
are working to find solutions to the hu-
manitarian crisis that is unfolding in
Yemen, a mission for which we should
be unified in our support.
Madam Speaker, with that, I urge a
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question,
and a ‘‘no’’ on the underlying meas-
ures.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I just find it a little
bit interesting that for the last couple
of days, my Republican friends have
been assailing us for introducing a
sense of Congress resolution, and here
we have a sense of Congress resolution
from them.
I guess you can’t make this stuff up.
But in any event, look, I will say to
my colleagues, you don’t need to defeat
the previous question to make clear
that you believe that people with pre-
existing conditions should be pro-
tected, because this sense of Congress
wouldn’t do that.
We have a law that does that now, a
law that, unfortunately, my Repub-
lican friends have been trying to repeal
for years.
So if Members want to protect people
with preexisting conditions, then they
ought to support us on our sense of
Congress resolution.
So, Madam Speaker, when it comes
down to it, both of these resolutions
that we are offering today are about
what this Congress is willing to tol-
erate, whether we are willing to tol-
erate our Nation’s involvement in the
Saudi-led war in Yemen, despite never
having authorized it in the first place.
Do we really want our Nation to be
partners with a regime that murders
journalists like Jamal Khashoggi?
President Trump has said of Saudi
Arabia: ‘‘They have been a great ally.’’
Well, I disagree.
And I hope that this Congress will
now speak with one voice that we will
not look the other way when it comes
to the murder of a U.S. reporter, that
we will not look the other way when it
comes to the murder of innocent people
in Yemen, bombing school buses, bomb-
ing weddings, bombing funerals.
Enough. We have to say enough. We
are no longer okay with the U.S. and
Yemen going on unchecked for another
year.
This is about whether this Congress
is going to tolerate the administration
trying to rip away millions of people’s
healthcare as well. I know I am not—
and many of my colleagues aren’t ei-
ther—willing to tolerate that.
This morning, I joined with many
Members of Congress in the House and
Senate, including Leader PELOSI and
Senator SCHUMER. We marched from
the House and the Senate to the Su-
preme Court to call on this administra-
tion to stop its assault on Americans’
healthcare.
Abolishing the Affordable Care Act
may be just a talking point to the
President, but this law is literally a
matter of life and death for people.
Millions and millions of Americans
could lose their insurance coverage.
Premiums and out-of-pocket costs
could skyrocket, and lifesaving
healthcare could once again be out of
reach.
The President and his allies claim to
support protections for preexisting
conditions, they claim that the Repub-
lican Party is the party of healthcare,
but their actions say otherwise.
When this House voted on the first
day of this Congress to allow us to in-
tervene in Texas v. U.S., more than 190
Republicans sided with the President
on his brutal assault on Americans’
healthcare.
The majority is not going to stand
for it.
Enough is enough. Enough with the
unauthorized wars abroad, enough with
the assault on people’s healthcare.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
on the previous question, this rule, and
the underlying resolutions.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong and unequivocal support for the rule
governing debate on H. Res. 271 as well as
the underlying resolution and ask all Members
to join me in supporting this resolution which
condemns the Trump Administration’s ongoing
legal campaign to take away health care from
more than 100 million Americans and to make
health care dramatically less affordable for
those fortunate enough to be insured.
I thank Congressman ALLRED, my Texas
congressional delegation colleague, for intro-
ducing this important resolution.
As a new member of Congress who un-
seated an opponent who voted to repeal the
Affordable Care Act dozens of times, the gen-
tlemen from Texas knows first-hand how im-
portant and critical access to affordable, high
quality, accessible health care available to ev-
eryone, including those with pre-existing con-
ditions, to the well-being of American families.
Because of the passage of the Affordable
Care Act, the national uninsured rate has
been slashed from 14.8 in 2012 to 8.89 per-
cent in 2018.
Texas has long led the nation in rate of un-
insured so the comparable rates are 24.6 and
15 percent, respectively.
Madam Speaker, I distinctly recall a can-
didate for the highest public office in the land
saying ‘‘Obamacare is a disaster’’ and appeal-
ing for voters to support him with this ques-
tion:
‘‘What have you got to lose?’’
The question deserves a response so I
hope that person, who occupies the Oval Of-
fice, is listening to my answer.
The Affordable Care Act, or ‘‘Obamacare,’’
has been an unmitigated success to the more
than 20 million Americans who for the first
time now have the security and peace of mind
that comes with affordable, accessible, high
quality health care.
Madam Speaker, Tip O’Neill used to say
that ‘‘all politics is local’’ so let me share with
you how Obamacare has dramatically
changed lives for the better for the people in
my home state of Texas.
1.874 million Texans who have gained cov-
erage since the ACA was implemented could
lose their coverage if the ACA is entirely or
partially repealed or invalidated.
1.1 million Texans who purchased high
quality Marketplace coverage now stand to
lose their coverage if Texas v. United States,
No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.), the lawsuit
brought by Republican Governors, and now
whole-heartedly supported and aided by the
Trump Administration were to succeed.
913,177 individuals Texans who received fi-
nancial assistance to purchase Marketplace
coverage in 2016, averaging $271 per indi-
vidual, are at risk of having coverage become
unaffordable if the Republican Congress elimi-
nates the premium tax credits.
1.1 million Texans could have insurance if
all states adopted the ACA’s Medicaid expan-
sion; these individuals will not be able to gain
coverage if the Republican Congress elimi-
nates the Medicaid expansion.
508,000 kids in Texas who have gained
coverage since the ACA was implemented are
also at risk of having their coverage rolled
back.
205,000 young adult Texans who were able
to stay on a parent’s health insurance plan
thanks to the ACA now stand to lose coverage
if the Republican Congress eliminates the re-
quirement that insurers allow children to stay
on their parents’ plans until age 26.
646,415 Texans who received cost-sharing
reductions to lower out-of-pocket costs such
as deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance are
now at risk of having healthcare become
unaffordable if the Republican Congress elimi-
nates cost-sharing reductions.
10.28 million Texans who now have private
health insurance that covers preventive serv-
ices without any co-pays, coinsurance, or
deductibles stand to lose this access if the Re-
publican Congress eliminates ACA provisions
requiring health insurers to cover important
preventive services without cost-sharing.
Women in Texas who can now purchase in-
surance for the same price as men are at risk
of being charged more for insurance if the
ACA’s ban on gender rating in the individual
and small group markets is invalidated.
Before the ACA, women paid up to 56 per-
cent more than men for their health insurance.
Roughly 4.5 million Texans who have pre-
existing health conditions are at risk of having
their coverage rescinded, being denied cov-
erage, or being charged significantly more for
coverage if the ACA’s ban on pre-existing con-
ditions is struck down.
346,750 Texas seniors who have saved an
average of $1,057 each as a result of closing
the Medicare prescription drug ‘‘donut hole’’
gap in coverage stand to lose this critical help
going forward.
1.75 million Texas seniors who have re-
ceived free preventive care services thanks to
ACA provisions requiring coverage of annual
wellness visits and eliminating cost-sharing for

many recommended preventive services cov-
ered by Medicare Part B, such as cancer
screenings, are at risk of losing access to
these services if congressional Republicans
go forward with their plan to repeal the ACA.
The Affordable Care Act works and has
made a life-affirming difference in the lives of
millions of Americans, in Texas and across the
country.
This is what happens when a visionary
president cares enough to work with a com-
mitted and empathetic Congress to address
the real issues facing the American people.
You want to know why the American people
have Obamacare?
It is because Obama cared.
The same cannot be said about this Repub-
lican president and congressional Republicans
who have made careers of attacking and un-
dermining the Affordable Care Act’s protec-
tions and benefits for the American people.
I urge all Members to vote for H. Res. 271
and send a powerful message to the President
and the American people that this House will
not stand idly by as this Administration tries to
take away health care from more than 130
million persons.
Instead, this House will resist by all constitu-
tional and appropriate means, including op-
posing this Administration in the courts and by
passing the ‘‘Protecting Pre-Existing Condi-
tions and Making Health Care More Affordable
Act of 2019,’’ which will lower health insurance
premiums with strengthened and expanded af-
fordability assistance by:
1. strengthening tax credits in the Market-
place to lower Americans’ health insurance
premiums and allows more middle-class indi-
viduals and families to qualify for subsidies;
2. ensuring that families who don’t have an
offer of affordable coverage from an employer
can still qualify for subsidies in the Market-
place; and,
3. providing funding for reinsurance, to help
with high-cost claims, improve Marketplace
stability, and prevent the Administration’s sab-
otage from raising premiums.
The ‘‘Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and
Making Health Care More Affordable Act of
2019,’’ will also strengthen protections for peo-
ple with pre-existing conditions by curtailing
the Administration’s efforts to give states waiv-
ers to undermine protections for people with
pre-existing conditions and weaken standards
for essential health benefits.
These improper waivers leave consumers
with less comprehensive plans that do not
cover needed services, such as prescription
drugs, maternity care and substance use dis-
order treatment.
Another way the ‘‘Protecting Pre-Existing
Conditions and Making Health Care More Af-
fordable Act of 2019,’’ protects consumers is
by prohibiting insurance companies from sell-
ing junk health insurance plans that do not
provide coverage for essential medical treat-
ments and drugs, or cover people with pre-ex-
isting medical conditions.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows:

So the resolution was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, had I been
present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall
No. 140 and ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 141.
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, to protect the right to life
for innocent children who are born
alive instead of allowing the State-
sponsored murder after birth, and ask
for its immediate consideration in the
House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, if
that is the case, I would ask the Speak-
er and the majority leader to imme-
diately bring that bill to the floor to
allow us all to stand up for the sanc-
tity of life.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not been recognized for de-
bate.
f
CONDEMNING THE TRUMP ADMIN-
ISTRATION’S LEGAL CAMPAIGN
TO TAKE AWAY AMERICANS’
HEALTH CARE
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on H. Res. 271.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey?
There was no objection.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 274, I call up
the resolution (H. Res. 271) Con-
demning the Trump Administration’s
Legal Campaign to Take Away Ameri-
cans’ Health Care, and ask for its im-
mediate consideration in the House.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 274, the resolu-
tion is considered read.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 271
Whereas on February 26, 2018, 18 State at-
torneys general and 2 Governors filed a law-
suit in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Texas, Texas v.
United States, No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.)
(in this preamble referred to as ‘‘Texas v.
United States’’), arguing that the require-
ment of the Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act (Public Law 111–148; 124 Stat.
119) (in this preamble referred to as the
‘‘ACA’’) to maintain minimum essential cov-
erage is unconstitutional and, as a result,
the court should invalidate the entire law;
Whereas in a June 7, 2018, letter to Con-
gress, then Attorney General Jefferson Ses-
sions announced that the Department of Jus-
tice—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2957
April 2, 2019
(1) would not defend the constitutionality
of the minimum essential coverage provi-
sion; and
(2) would argue that provisions protecting
individuals with pre-existing conditions (spe-
cifically the provisions commonly known as
‘‘community rating’’ and ‘‘guaranteed
issue’’) are inseverable from the minimum
essential coverage provision and should be
invalidated;
Whereas in the June 7, 2018, letter to Con-
gress, Attorney General Sessions also ad-
vised Congress that ‘‘the Department will
continue to argue that Section 5000A(a) is
severable from the remaining provisions of
the ACA’’, indicating a difference from the
plaintiffs’ position in Texas v. United States;
Whereas on December 14, 2018, the United
States District Court for the Northern Dis-
trict of Texas issued an order that declared
the requirement to maintain minimum es-
sential coverage unconstitutional and struck
down the ACA in its entirety, including pro-
tections for individuals with pre-existing
conditions;
Whereas the decision of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of
Texas was stayed and is pending appeal be-
fore the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit;
Whereas on March 25, 2019, the Department
of Justice, in a letter to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
changed its position and announced that the
entire ruling of the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Texas
should be upheld and the entire ACA should
be declared unconstitutional;
Whereas prior to 2014, individuals with pre-
existing conditions were routinely denied
health insurance coverage, subject to cov-
erage exclusions, charged unaffordable pre-
mium rates, exposed to unaffordable out-of-
pocket costs, and subject to lifetime and an-
nual limits on health insurance coverage;
Whereas as many as 133,000,000 nonelderly
people in the United States—
(1) have a pre-existing condition and could
have been denied coverage, only offered cov-
erage at an exorbitant price had they needed
individual market health insurance prior to
2014, or had coverage for their pre-existing
condition excluded prior to 2014; and
(2) will lose protections for pre-existing
conditions if the ruling of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of
Texas is upheld in Texas v. United States;
Whereas contrary to President Trump’s
public claims that he supports protections
for people with pre-existing conditions, he
has ordered his Department of Justice to ac-
tively pursue the destruction of these protec-
tions in Federal court;
Whereas employer-provided health plans
cannot place lifetime or annual limits on
health coverage, and if the Trump Adminis-
tration succeeds in its argument before the
court, more than 100,000,000 people in the
United States who receive health insurance
through their employer could once again
face lifetime or annual coverage limits;
Whereas if the Trump Administration suc-
ceeds in its argument before the court, insur-
ers would be allowed to impose an unlimited
‘‘age tax’’ on the health insurance premiums
of older Americans;
Whereas prior to 2010, Medicare enrollees
faced massive out-of-pocket prescription
drug costs once they reached a certain
threshold known as the Medicare ‘‘donut
hole’’, and since the donut hole began closing
in 2010, millions of Medicare beneficiaries
have saved billions of dollars on prescription
drugs;
Whereas at a time when 3 in 10 adults re-
port not taking prescribed medicines because
of the cost, if the Trump Administration suc-
ceeds in its argument before the court, sen-
iors enrolled in Medicare would face billions
of dollars in new prescription drug costs;
Whereas as of March 2019, 37 States, includ-
ing the District of Columbia, have expanded
or are in the process of expanding Medicaid
to individuals with incomes up to 138 percent
of the Federal poverty level, providing
health coverage to more than 12,000,000
newly eligible people;
Whereas if the Trump Administration suc-
ceeds in its argument before the court, the
millions of individuals and families who re-
ceive coverage from Medicaid could lose eli-
gibility and no longer have access to health
care;
Whereas as of March 2019, many people who
buy individual health insurance are provided
tax credits to reduce the cost of premiums
and assistance to reduce out-of-pocket costs
such as copays and deductibles, which has
made individual health insurance coverage
affordable for millions of people in the
United States for the first time;
Whereas if the Trump Administration suc-
ceeds in its argument before the court, the
health insurance individual exchanges would
be eliminated and millions of people in the
United States who buy health insurance on
the individual marketplaces could lose cov-
erage and would see premium expenses for
individual health insurance increase exorbi-
tantly;
Whereas if the Trump Administration suc-
ceeds in its argument before the court, peo-
ple in the United States would lose numer-
ous consumer protections in their coverage,
including the requirements that—
(1) plans offer preventive care without
cost-sharing;
(2) young adults have the option to remain
on a parent’s insurance plan until age 26; and
(3) many health insurance plans offer a
comprehensive set of essential health bene-
fits such as maternity care, addiction treat-
ment, and prescription drug coverage;
Whereas pursuant to section 516 of title 28,
United States Code, the conduct of litigation
in which the United States is a party is re-
served to the Department of Justice;
Whereas public reports suggest that the
President and his political advisors directed
this course of action in direct contravention
of the Department of Justice’s longstanding
policy to defend Acts of Congress and duty to
advance reasonable analysis of legal ques-
tions, for example—
(1) when the Department of Justice
changed its litigating position on June 7,
2018, in the Texas v. United States case to
ask the court to strike down the ACA’s guar-
anteed issue and community rating require-
ments, thereby eliminating protections for
people with pre-existing conditions and rein-
stating legal discrimination based on health
status, that position was found to be so le-
gally indefensible that three of the four ca-
reer attorneys representing the Government
refused to sign the relevant briefs and re-
moved themselves from the case; and
(2) when the Department of Justice again
changed its litigating position on March 25,
2019, in the appeal of Texas v. United States
to seek the invalidation of every provision of
the ACA, it was reported that decision was
made over the objections of both the Depart-
ment of Justice as well as the Department of
Health and Human Services; and
Whereas the Trump Administration has
proceeded in the Texas v. United States law-
suit with total disregard for the con-
sequences of its actions for the lives of mil-
lions of Americans: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House
of Representatives that—
(1) the actions taken by the Trump Admin-
istration seeking the invalidation of the
ACA’s protections for people with pre-exist-
ing conditions, and later the invalidation of
the entire ACA, are an unacceptable assault
on the health care of the American people;
and
(2) the Department of Justice should—
(A) protect individuals with pre-existing
conditions, seniors struggling with high pre-
scription drug costs, and the millions of peo-
ple in the United States who newly gained
health insurance coverage since 2014;
(B) cease any and all efforts to destroy
Americans’ access to affordable health care;
and
(C) reverse its position in Texas v. United
States, No. 19–10011 (5th Cir.).
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution shall be debatable for 1 hour,
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce.
The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
PALLONE) and the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. WALDEN) each will control 30
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. ALLRED), who is the sponsor
of this resolution.
b 1400
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, I
thank Chairman PALLONE for his lead-
ership, and I am proud to lead the
charge on this resolution condemning
the administration’s attacks on Ameri-
can’s healthcare in Federal court.
With the support of so many of my
colleagues, this resolution puts the
United States Congress on the record
as being on the side of the people. As
this administration seeks to tear down
our healthcare system, this Congress
will not stand by while cynical and
partisan interests attack our
healthcare system and that of hard-
working Americans.
Whether it is allowing young people
to stay on their parent’s insurance
until they are 26, or protecting people
from lifetime caps, or ensuring that
folks with preexisting conditions get
the care that they need, this should not
be a partisan issue.
The fight to protect preexisting con-
ditions is personal for me. My mother
is a breast cancer survivor and my wife
Aly and I just celebrated the birth of
our son. Both of those are preexisting
conditions. And concern about
healthcare is, by far, the number one
issue that my constituents talk to me
about back home.
That brings me to Natalie, a lawyer
with young children, Hugo and Mia,
who is married to Nathan, a law pro-
fessor at Southern Methodist Univer-
sity. Nathan recently attended the
State of the Union here with me in
Washington.
I met Natalie on the same day that
the House voted to repeal the Afford-
able Care Act. I learned that she had
stage IV cancer and that she had come
to my event from her chemotherapy
treatment. She explained to me that
her goal was to fight her cancer for as
long as she could so that her two chil-
dren would know her.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2958 April 2, 2019
Natalie came to my event that day
because she was worried about future
moms who would lose their care if the
Affordable Care Act was repealed. She
was concerned about a return to the
bad old days with lifetime caps and dis-
crimination against people with pre-
existing conditions.
Sadly, Natalie passed away last year,
but her fight goes on, a fight that I am
honored to carry forward on behalf of
north Texans here in Washington. My
home State of Texas has the highest
uninsured rate in the country. One in
five people in Dallas County, where I
live, do not have health insurance. We
can and must do better.
I urge my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle in the House and the
Senate to join us in condemning these
attacks on our healthcare system. We
must make sure that we don’t go back
to the bad old days where people can
get thrown off their healthcare just be-
cause they got sick.
This resolution is a good first step,
but we must come together to help our
constituents by working together to
pass legislation that will stabilize our
system and lower costs for everyone.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple expect us to come to this floor with
solutions, not political ‘‘gotcha’’ state-
ments. The resolution before us in this
week’s Democratic dosage of attack on
the President is just that. It doesn’t do
a darn thing to protect people with pre-
existing conditions; not one thing.
In the opening day of the 116th Con-
gress, House Republicans brought a
powerful, but simple, measure to the
floor that called on this body to legis-
late on what we all agree needs to be
done: locking in protections for pa-
tients with preexisting conditions.
Let me repeat. Republicans acted on
day one of this Congress to protect
Americans with preexisting conditions.
Democrats blocked that.
In fact, I introduced legislation
which has 45 cosponsors that protects
people with preexisting conditions. Pe-
riod. This is something I have fought
for my entire time in public service. It
would lock in existing protections for
patients. It is before the Energy and
Commerce Committee, and I have
worked since the first day of this Con-
gress to get this measure passed so
that if the court decision that found
ObamaCare to be unconstitutional, if
that judge’s decision is upheld, we
want to make sure that our citizens
who have preexisting conditions still
have coverage.
The legislation I have sponsored
would do that. Republicans and Demo-
crats could get this done, and the ques-
tion is: Why are we not voting on that
today?
Instead, Democrats have rushed a
resolution to the floor that has never
had a hearing before the Energy and
Commerce Committee. So much for the
talk about due process and regular
order, Madam Speaker. No hearing, and
it was rushed to the floor.
We only got to see it for the first
time last Friday. So it is little more, in
my opinion, than a political screed, not
a public policy proposal. It will never
go to the Senate. It is only here. Amer-
icans ought to know this, too: that the
legal case working its way through the
courts did not immediately end
ObamaCare and will not affect insur-
ance coverage on premiums for 2019.
Moreover, Democrat attorneys gen-
eral and a couple of Republicans from
intervening States are already defend-
ing the law in this case, and the judge’s
ruling has been appealed. This body has
voted not once, but twice, to allow
Speaker PELOSI to intervene in the
case, and she has moved to do.
Just as my Democratic colleagues
have repeatedly refused to let this
House approve protections for people
with preexisting conditions, they also
know they could moot the lawsuit that
they so decry today. All they would
have to do is bring a bill to the floor
and vote to repeal the individual man-
date. That would turn off this lawsuit.
I am sure many on our side might be
happy to join them in that effort. And
if the Democrats didn’t want to do
that, they could vote to reinstate the
individual mandate penalty. That, too,
would moot the lawsuit. But we are not
doing that either.
So they had policy options that could
have been brought to the floor, three of
them. Two would have ended the law-
suit that they decry today, and one
would have given rock-solid security to
those with preexisting conditions if the
law is thrown out. There is no dif-
ference between us or among us about
protecting people with preexisting con-
ditions.
But, unfortunately, they chose not to
actually legislate. Democrats control
everything in this House. They decide
what gets heard in committee or, in
this case, not, and what is brought to
the floor, or not. So it is clear they
would rather play politics with
healthcare and attack the President
for political purposes rather than work
with us on what could and should be bi-
partisan solutions.
A fact that my friends on the other
side of the aisle must acknowledge is,
for many Americans seeking coverage,
healthcare costs keep getting more and
more expensive. Last week, the Bend
Bulletin, a newspaper in my district,
reported on a recent analysis by the
Kaiser Family Foundation about how
insurance premiums are out of reach
for many older, middle-class residents
of our area, particularly in rural areas,
including my home State.
They report: ‘‘In central Oregon, for
example, a 60-year-old individual with
an annual income of $50,000 must pay
at least $703 a month, representing 17
percent of his or her income, and that
would only buy a bronze plan with a
deductible of $6,500.’’
We should be focused on helping peo-
ple like that be able to afford insur-
ance.
When the Affordable Care Act passed,
Democrats promised people their insur-
ance premiums would actually go down
by $2,500. For many in America, that
promise was false. For many Ameri-
cans, healthcare costs, health insur-
ance premiums, and, certainly,
deductibles and copays have done noth-
ing but gone up and up.
I was in Oregon over the weekend and
held seven townhalls. Do you know
what I hear about when it comes to
healthcare? That insurance premiums
are out of reach for too many of my
constituents. And for those who cannot
afford the premiums, many make dif-
ficult choices, from choosing which
family members to cover, to changing
jobs, or limiting income in order to
continue to qualify for subsidies. This
is a real problem. I think we can find a
bipartisan solution if Democrats are
willing to work with us on it.
But, plainly, the current healthcare
system for too many Americans is not
working. So we know we have more
work to do, and I hope that our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
would agree with us that we need to
improve State markets that, in some
part, were damaged by ObamaCare;
that we should work together to lower
healthcare costs and increase access to
private health insurance.
In the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, actually, there are some things
we are working on, on drug costs. No
President, in my memory, has ever
leaned farther forward to get drug
costs down for American consumers
than President Trump. He has been an
incredible leader in this effort, and we
are going to see bipartisan work get
marked up tomorrow in the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
So on that topic of healthcare that is
so crucial to survivability of American
consumers, we can move forward. We
have proven that.
But, meanwhile, the American people
need to fully understand that the
Democrats’ one-size-fits-all, govern-
ment-run plan itself would end the Af-
fordable Care Act. You have to admit
that. That is what your Medicare-for-
all plan does.
They need to understand the $32 tril-
lion price tag for the Democrats’ alter-
native and the tax increases that would
be necessary to go with it; the doubling
of the individual income tax; doubling
of corporate tax; and providers would
have to take a 40 percent reduction in
their payments.
Think of what the wait lines will be
if that were to become law. Americans
need to know that when the Democrats
Medicare-for-all plan ends, employer-
sponsored healthcare and your union
plans you negotiated for, 158 million
Americans who have health insurance
today, will lose it tomorrow. They need
to understand how they would have to
wait longer for access to care than
they do today.
And for my older friends, they need
to understand the worst-case scenario.
Seniors in America need to fully under-
stand how this plan does away with

popular Medicare Advantage plans and
Medigap plans and impacts this pro-
posal would have on access to their
doctors and an earlier bankruptcy of
Medicare altogether.
So we would be better served today,
and so would the American people, if
we stood down, parked our partisan
swords and shields, and worked to-
gether to solve the real problems
Americans face when they go to pay
their family bills.
I had lunch today with a couple from
the southern part of my district, pro-
fessionals. They said the cost of health
insurance for them is so high they have
had to make the choice not to have it.
This is going on every day in the
marketplace, and I wish we could come
together and spend our time on this
House floor with a solution we could
agree upon, because I think we could.
But that is not what we are doing
today.
It is like every week there has to be
a resolution on the floor to condemn
the President, something he said or
did; not a policy proposal that will ac-
tually solve the Nation’s problems.
That is all you are dealing with today,
another screed.
So let’s work together. Let’s come
together as this Congress can, and as
the Energy and Commerce Committee
has had a wonderful record of doing
over the years, and can going forward,
to address healthcare and other issues.
We can do that.
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this partisan,
political resolution, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), our majority
leader.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I would hope that we could do what the
gentleman from Oregon wants to do
and work together in a bipartisan fash-
ion.
I will say to him, however, that his
party was in control from 2011 to last
year, and there was almost no effort to
accomplish that objective. There were,
however, over 65 votes to repeal, and
there was no replace. When his party
won the Presidency as well, there was
no replace. We passed something
through this House that couldn’t get
through the Senate. The Senate was
controlled by the gentleman’s party.
This is something that is not op-
tional for any of our citizens.
Healthcare is essential, and they ex-
pect us to sit down and work together.
Unfortunately, today, we saw in a
tweet—the President who campaigned
on the basis of everybody was going to
be covered at less cost and higher qual-
ity. We are now, I suppose, in about the
29th month in the President’s term. He
has sent us no bill—and this morning,
he has the gall, in my opinion, to tell
the American people: I have got a plan.
It is secret, and I will show it to you in
2021.
What is interesting about 2021? It is
after the election.
Elections ought to be about policy.
The election of 2018 was about policy,
healthcare, and, very frankly, our ar-
gument prevailed. Our argument was
that we wanted to protect the Afford-
able Care Act; that we wanted to make
sure that the protections included in
the Affordable Care Act were available
to all Americans.
b 1415
Madam Speaker, I want to thank
Representative ALLRED for introducing
this resolution, and I rise in support of
it.
Since taking office, President Trump
and his administration have been fo-
cused on doing everything it can to
take affordable healthcare coverage op-
tions away from American families.
Madam Speaker, you can make
healthcare a lot cheaper. Offer them no
coverage—it is very simple—not hos-
pitalization, not doctors’ reimburse-
ment, not this, not that, and not the
other. We call them junk policies. They
pretend to be health coverage when
they are not.
The President did make two failed ef-
forts along with his party to repeal the
Affordable Care Act in Congress. They
came after Republicans tried to repeal
or undermine the bill in more than 65
votes during their years in the major-
ity. The American people do not want
to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,
because if they did, then they wouldn’t
have us in the majority because they
know we want to keep it. They want
Congress, however, to work to improve
and make our healthcare system work
better for all Americans, and, yes, have
it affordable and accessible.
Instead, President Trump and Repub-
licans have doubled down and tripled
down on their agenda of sabotaging the
law through executive actions on an al-
most weekly and monthly basis and
through lawsuits like the one now
pending in Texas.
I am not sure who convinced the
President to change his mind, but I
have a suspicion Mick Mulvaney did.
Mick Mulvaney, of course, voted 65
times—well, I don’t know that he was
here every one of those votes, but
every time he had an opportunity, he
voted to repeal the Affordable Care
Act. If the Americans wanted to repeal
the Affordable Care Act, then they
would have voted against us.
Madam Speaker, I would tell my
friend from Oregon that if it is par-
tisan, it is partisan because none of
you will support it, and so many of you
campaigned on the basis of wanting to
protect preexisting conditions. Obvi-
ously, the President changed his mind
about doing that.
All this resolution does is express the
sense of this House that such efforts
are wrong and would harm tens of mil-
lions of Americans who benefit from
the ACA. This includes the 133 million
or more Americans living with pre-
existing conditions like asthma, diabe-
tes, cancer, et cetera, et cetera, et
cetera, who are protected in their abil-
ity to get healthcare insurance.
The actions taken by President
Trump, however, and the Republicans
would make these individuals uninsur-
able, forcing them and their families
into financial hardship in order to pay
for medical bills. It also includes older
Americans for whom Republicans have
proposed an age tax.
It would do harm to the 20 million
Americans who are now covered be-
cause of the Affordable Care Act who
would lose their coverage as a result of
what President Trump and Republicans
in Congress are seeking to do. That is
what the lawsuit does. This says that
we don’t agree with the lawsuit—a
pretty simple proposition.
By joining the Texas lawsuit, the
Trump administration is seeking to
allow women to be charged higher pre-
miums than men as they used to be. It
seeks to allow lifetime and annual lim-
its on coverage, which the Affordable
Care Act banned. In addition, it is try-
ing to force Americans under age 26 to
get coverage on their own, even if they
don’t have a job yet and are still in col-
lege.
Preventive health visits and
screenings would, once more, require
out-of-pocket co-pays. Plans would no
longer be required to cover essential
health benefits. Now, if you don’t have
to cover required health benefits, then
you are going to get a cheaper policy,
not a lot of coverage, but a cheaper
policy. The objective is not just a
cheaper policy, it is a policy that cov-
ers your risks. If we can make it cheap-
er, then we ought to do that. Plans
would no longer be required to cover,
as I said, essential benefits such as ma-
ternity care and prescription drugs.
This resolution is an opportunity to
state on the RECORD whether Members
support doing away with these reforms
or not. Now, that doesn’t mean you
think that an alternative is perfect, it
simply means that we either want to
improve or replace it with something
that is viable, passable, and good for
the American people, whether to turn
back the clock or look ahead, and
whether to stand with the Trump ad-
ministration as it seeks to dismantle
every single piece of the Affordable
Care Act, which it has done.
The gentleman mentions maybe a
daily resolution, well, unfortunately,
we have daily action by the President
that does things that we don’t think
are appropriate. We voted on one of
those the other day where we appro-
priated money to a certain object, and
the President wants to change it on his
own. We think that was unconstitu-
tional. We didn’t get a lot of help on
the Republican side, the gentleman did,
I agree with that, the gentleman who
has spoken before me.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
join me and others in supporting Rep-
resentative ALLRED’s resolution in ex-
pressing bipartisan opposition to the

Trump administration’s efforts—not to
Trump, but to the policies. We ought to
be talking about policies, not personal-
ities. It is not about personalities. It is
about policies and do we believe that
we ought to repeal the Affordable Care
Act without a replacement?
I think the answer to that ought to
be an emphatic ‘‘no’’ for all of us. The
gentleman is correct. We ought to
work on a bipartisan basis to accom-
plish good objectives for our people.
This vote will show every single Amer-
ican where his or her Representative
stands on the question which is so con-
sequential to the everyday lives of mil-
lions and millions of Americans.
The President clearly has no inten-
tion—he said in his tweet today—of
sending a bill down here until 2021, 2
years and more from now. How sad to
be the leader of our country and say: I
am not going to tell you what I am
going to do, just trust me.
Well, Mr. President, we don’t have
any reason based upon your perform-
ance to trust you to make sure that
Americans have what you said you
were going to give them, that every-
body was going to be covered at lower
cost or higher quality.
Vote for this resolution and tell the
American people that when you said on
the campaign trail: I am for pre-
existing conditions, you meant it; and
when you said that there were other
protections that you wanted to keep in
the bill, you meant it.
If you do, then you will vote for this
resolution and send a message—democ-
racy is a lot about messages—by talk-
ing to one another. This is the way the
Congress can talk to the administra-
tion—one way. We can talk a lot of
ways.
Have that communication be clear:
Mr. President, leave the Affordable
Care Act alone and work with us to
make it better and work for all Ameri-
cans, which is what you said you would
do during the course of the campaign.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, may
I inquire as to how much time each
side has remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 201⁄2 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from New
Jersey has 261⁄2 minutes.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to make a couple of comments.
First of all, the President is very
good to work with, and we worked in a
bipartisan manner last Congress to ad-
dress the Nation’s opioid epidemic.
That is a healthcare issue and a life-
and-death issue. We passed 60 bipar-
tisan bills that became law, and Presi-
dent Trump signed them.
We extended health insurance for
children in America—the CHIP pro-
gram, the Children’s Health Insurance
Program—for 10 years. That is twice as
long as ever had been done before. We
did that on the Energy and Commerce
Committee, and the President signed
that. In my State, that is 122,700 Or-
egon kids and pregnant moms who are
covered for certainty for 10 years under
that insurance program. We reauthor-
ized and fully funded community
health centers. Now 240,000 Oregonians
in 63 sites in my district get their
healthcare from community health
centers, Madam Speaker, and we did
that at a fully funded record level.
Now, I just want to address some-
thing my friend, the majority leader
who schedules bills on the floor, said
about how we voted to repeal
ObamaCare 65 times. What he kind of
failed to mention is Democrats voted
for not quite half of those, I would
wager, because 25 of those votes be-
came law, signed in large part, if not
totally, by one Barack Obama, because
there were problems in the Affordable
Care Act or ObamaCare, however you
want to describe it, that this Congress
interceded on and in a bipartisan way
voted to repeal ‘‘ObamaCare.’’ That is
what the leader said, the 65 were all to
repeal.
I would argue he probably voted for a
bunch of those, because some of them
passed unanimously in the House and
Senate. Even President Obama agreed
there were mistakes in ObamaCare.
Our argument is we can fix America’s
healthcare laws going forward, and we
should.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Montana (Mr.
GIANFORTE), who is a terrific new Mem-
ber of Congress and of the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for the time.
Madam Speaker, I hear from hard-
working Montanans in my office and
throughout the State that they are
worried about the rising cost of
healthcare. Rising premiums and in-
creasing deductibles force Montana
families to spend more and more on
healthcare and less and less on clothes,
books, and food for the table.
Since my first day in office, I have
made lowering healthcare costs, pro-
moting rural access to care, and pro-
tecting those with preexisting condi-
tions my primary priorities.
Unfortunately, the Affordable Care
Act has been anything but affordable.
In the first 3 years of ObamaCare, pre-
miums in Montana rose by 66 percent,
and they are still rising today.
ObamaCare robbed consumers of choice
and gave hardworking Montanans
plans they can’t afford.
As we work toward solutions that
make healthcare more accessible and
affordable, I will keep fighting to pro-
tect those with preexisting conditions.
I cosponsored the Pre-Existing Condi-
tions Protection Act that ensures pa-
tients with preexisting conditions have
access to health insurance. I also voted
to ensure those same protections. We
need to ensure that those with pre-
existing conditions have coverage.
House Democrats have said they are
for protecting those with preexisting
conditions. Unfortunately, Madam
Speaker, it seems they are only inter-
ested in defending them if the solution
includes preserving ObamaCare or pur-
suing a government-run, single-payer
healthcare plan.
One of the earliest votes we took in
this Congress was to lock in protec-
tions for Americans with preexisting
conditions. It was a simple and
straightforward measure that I enthu-
siastically voted for. It would protect
Americans with preexisting conditions
period—so simple and straightforward.
We should revisit that approach.
Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, my
friends across the aisle voted down
that measure, because it appears the
majority values trying to score polit-
ical points more than providing cer-
tainty and peace of mind to Americans
with preexisting conditions.
I hope they will come to the table in
good faith and choose to work with us
to find a bipartisan solution to bring
down healthcare costs and protect peo-
ple with preexisting conditions.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I
continue to yield myself such time as I
may consume to say that I appreciate
the gentleman’s comments and share
them.
This is H.R. 692, legislation that
would guarantee Americans with pre-
existing conditions are not discrimi-
nated against. We have a lot of cospon-
sors on this, but we don’t have a single
Democrat willing to cosponsor a bill
that would provide protection to Amer-
icans should this judge’s decision be
upheld. That is my argument today.
Why wouldn’t we go ahead and sched-
ule this, pass this, and move this to the
floor so that if by some means this
judge’s decision is upheld, Americans
with a preexisting condition would
have coverage?
Meanwhile, why don’t we start hear-
ings on the Medicare for All proposal
that Democrats have championed?
I have asked for those hearings from
my friend. We have not seen that hap-
pen, and I know there is a certain dust-
up in the press even today about alleg-
ing the Speaker’s own staff person here
may have been saying things or not
about whether this is a good idea or
not.
We ought to have a hearing on that
because close to 200 million Americans
might lose their insurance under this
plan. So there is lots we should be
doing here.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I

from California (Ms. PELOSI), who is

House have exacted on the Affordable
Care Act.
I want to pay special tribute to the
outside groups, the patient advocacy
groups, the Little Lobbyists, the chil-
dren, so many people who spoke and
told their stories at 10,000 events across
the country to oppose the Republicans’
constant assault on the Affordable
Care Act for the first 2 years of the
Trump administration, a time when
the President had the White House, the
House, and the Senate and could very
well have passed legislation to replace
the Affordable Care Act, as they said
they would do.
b 1430
They didn’t replace it because they
don’t believe in a government role.
Much about the Affordable Care Act
has to do with Medicare and how we
prolonged the life of Medicare and ad-
justed funding so that we could reduce
the cost of prescription drugs for our
seniors.
The Republican approach to Medi-
care is that it should wither on the
vine, that there is no place in a free so-
ciety, in a free economy, for Medicare.
Let’s understand this. This is not
just about the issue or the legislation
of the Affordable Care Act. This is
about a value system in our country,
about understanding that healthcare is
a right for all Americans, not just a
privilege.
Yes, they could get preexisting condi-
tions coverage—with rates that go
right through the ceiling and are a gift
to the insurance industry, but not to
make care affordable and accessible to
all.
So, here we are, in an unusual situa-
tion where the Affordable Care Act is
the law of the land, and it is the re-
sponsibility of the Justice Department
and the administration to defend the
law of the land in court, and what are
they doing? Just the opposite. Why?
Because they don’t believe in govern-
ance.
That is why they are happy to shut
down government for any reason. They
don’t believe in governance. They don’t
believe in a public role in the well-
being of the American people. They
don’t believe in the Affordable Care
Act.
What they are trying to do is strike
down every last provision of the ACA:
protection for preexisting conditions,
which I will come back to; bans of life-
time and annual limits; the Medicaid
expansion; Medicare solvency going
out for many more years; savings for
seniors on prescription drug costs; and
the vital premium assistance that
makes healthcare coverage affordable
for millions of families. It all would be
ended if the President and the Repub-
licans in Congress get their way. I hope
it is not all Republicans in Congress,
because I hope that some of them will
care enough about their constituents
and meeting their needs.
On the subject of preexisting condi-
tions, how many times during cam-
paigns did they say, ‘‘Oh, we are for
preexisting conditions,’’ having voted
it down over and over and over again?
The misrepresentations were almost
embarrassing. Let’s look the other
way, so we don’t embarrass them any
further. It is almost a joke, but it is
not funny if you have a preexisting
condition.
What was interesting about the Af-
fordable Care Act is it wasn’t just
about expanding coverage to 20 million
more people. That, in itself, would be a
justification. It was about the more
than 150 million families who had bet-
ter coverage, on a trajectory of lower
cost, better benefits, no preexisting
condition barrier, no lifetime limits,
no annual limits, and the rest. And if
your child is up to 26 years old, your
child could be on your policy.
Actually, the issue of subsidizing
those so that everyone could partici-
pate and it would be affordable, can we
do more there? We certainly can, and
we certainly will.
I want to tell this story. As I said,
the outside groups were so instru-
mental in saving us from the Repub-
lican sabotage of the Affordable Care
Act and of the good health of the
American people. The outside groups
held, as I said, 10,000 events around the
country, telling stories. Nothing con-
veys more information and more un-
derstanding than people telling their
own stories.
The statistics are interesting. They
are staggering. But the stories are pow-
erful, and they make a difference.
I am going to tell the story that I
have told before. It is about America’s
families paying the price and Amer-
ica’s children paying the price for this
Republican sabotage of the Affordable
Care Act.
The story I would like to tell is about
Zoe Madison Lihn. Zoe was born with a
congenital heart defect in May 2010.
She faced the first of her three heart
surgeries at just 15 hours old.
By 6 months old, Zoe was halfway
through the lifetime limit that her in-
surer had placed on her case. She faced
a grim future, not just using up her
lifetime limit by preschool—her life-
time limit was used up, but her pre-
existing condition had not gone away—
but carrying the preexisting condition
that would require attention and care
for the rest of her life.
Under the ACA, Zoe is protected. She
will celebrate her 9th birthday next
month.
But the Republicans want to take all
that away, not only from Zoe but from
their own constituents.
Our Democratic House majority will
not let that stand. Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., said: ‘‘Of all the forms of in-
equality, injustice in healthcare is the
most shocking and inhumane because
it often results in physical death.’’
Our colleagues are used to our col-
league, Whip CLYBURN, telling that
story, which I think he heard Dr. King
say.
On day one of this Congress, fresh-
man Member from Texas Congressman
COLIN ALLRED led the way. House
Democrats voted to throw the full legal
weight of the House against the Texas
lawsuit to destroy the ACA.
We salute Congressman ALLRED for
his outstanding leadership to protect
America’s families’ health and to reach
out to the Republicans to join him in
doing so. But more than 190 Repub-
licans voted to be fully complicit in
that attempt to overthrow the ACA
and tear away those health protec-
tions.
Now, with this resolution led again
by Congressman ALLRED, we call on
our Republican colleagues to go on the
record once more. Either they will vote
for protecting their constituents’
healthcare, or they will vote for taking
it away. With this vote, we will see
their values and their intentions.
House Democrats will always fight to
protect families’ affordable and quality
healthcare. We don’t see it as an issue
or legislation. We see it as a value—a
value. It is not just about healthcare.
It is about the good health of America,
a source of our strength.
After we pass this resolution, we will
continue to advance our trans-
formative legislation to reverse the
GOP healthcare sabotage. We will
lower healthcare costs and strengthen
protections for people with preexisting
medical conditions.
By the way, under the Affordable
Care Act, being a woman is no longer a
preexisting medical condition. As a
mother of five, I can attest to that
being a preexisting condition.
Democrats are for the people: low-
ering healthcare costs by reducing the
costs of prescription drugs, preserving
the preexisting condition benefit, in-
creasing wages by building the infra-
structure in a green way, and cleaning
up government. Lower healthcare
costs, bigger paychecks, cleaner gov-
ernment.
Once we can reduce the role of dark,
special-interest money in Washington,
D.C., people will have confidence that
it is possible that their voices will be
heard more strongly than the voices of
those who stand in the way of progress.
Three months ago from tomorrow,
the Members of this institution, Demo-
crats and Republicans, took a solemn
oath to protect and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States. The
Constitution of the United States,
after the beautiful preamble of our Na-
tion’s purpose, is Article I, the legisla-
tive branch. The legislative branch’s
responsibilities are spelled out in the
text of the Constitution.
This body, the first branch of govern-
ment, voted to protect the health and
well-being of the American people. It is
the law of the land. It is the responsi-
bility of the executive branch to pro-
tect the law of the land.
They have departed from that and,
therefore, departed from our oath to
the Constitution to protect and defend.
If they have a better idea, we haven’t
seen it. On top of that, the President
has said we won’t see it until 2021, after
the 2020 elections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2962 April 2, 2019
That is just not good enough, Mr.
President. The needs of the American
people will not stop right now because
you have stopped believing in them.
The needs of the American people go
on, and we will continue this fight. We
will fight in the Congress; we will fight
in the courts; and we will fight in the
court of public opinion.
I hope that we can have some Repub-
lican support from the other side of the
aisle to vote to protect America’s fami-
lies and their healthcare and, there-
fore, strengthen America.
Madam Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’
vote.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I hope, before the
Speaker of the House leaves, she will
listen to this.
I was moved by her story about a
young child with a congenital heart de-
fect, but nobody is going to lecture me
about the need to protect people with
preexisting conditions or the need to
repeal the lifetime caps.
Let me tell you a story about a
young man with a heart defect. Feb-
ruary 7, 1994, he was born in Portland,
Oregon, at Oregon Health Sciences Uni-
versity, with hypoplastic left heart
syndrome. It would require immediate
surgery and multiple surgeries to try
to save his life, or a complete heart
transplant.
Tragically, that little boy did not
live long enough to be flown to Loma
Linda Hospital in California for that
heart transplant.
His name: Garrison Daniel Walden.
He died the next day.
Madam Speaker, nobody is going to
tell me about the need to protect peo-
ple with preexisting conditions. No-
body is going to lecture me about the
need to get rid of caps on lifetime. My
wife and I dealt with those issues di-
rectly, and I will always stand up for
people who face similar challenges.
That is not what this is about today,
and you can laugh if you want.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCARTHY).
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congressman WALDEN for his so-
bering words, for his actions. He has a
bill that will protect preexisting condi-
tions. The difference about that to
today: It is actually a bill; this is a res-
olution.
I always thought, when you ran for
Congress, you would want to do more
than a press release. Apparently, it is
different with the new election, Madam
Speaker.
‘‘Show me your budget, show me
your values.’’ It has been said so many
times on this floor. Those were the
words that have been recited by Speak-
er PELOSI quite frequently. You could
have a whole ring of videos of her just
saying those exact words.
But, of course, that was before the
newly minted Democratic majority
quickly decided they won’t be intro-
ducing a budget.
Madam Speaker, I wonder if America
will question the values. It appears
they won’t be sharing their values with
the American people. But if we had
questions as to what those values were,
this week removes all doubt.
Madam Speaker, we are celebrating
40 years of C–SPAN, but I wonder if
those who are watching today under-
stand what is happening. You see, on
this floor, they learned early on, even
from a childhood of ‘‘Schoolhouse
Rock,’’ I’m just a bill on Capitol Hill.
This is not a bill we are talking
about. This isn’t even a resolution that
goes to the Senate. This will never end
up with the President. This will do
nothing for your healthcare. What will
it do? It will make a great press re-
lease.
The difference, Madam Speaker, in
one election is what happens on this
floor. The difference is: Do you really
want to protect people with preexisting
conditions? Because, Madam Speaker,
there is an individual who has a bill
that is filed, that has cosponsorship,
that is sitting in committee, that the
Democrats control. They didn’t mark
it up. They didn’t talk about it. They
wrote a resolution.
To those who are watching on C–
SPAN, I know what they have watched
on this floor before. I know what they
watched in the last Congress, that we
sat and talked about not a resolution
for children’s health, for the CHIP pro-
gram, but we wrote a bill. We extended
it longer than anyone has ever dreamed
possible, a full decade.
Yes, Madam Speaker, we had to do it
with one side of the aisle, because the
majority on the other side of the aisle
didn’t even write a press release sup-
porting it. They voted ‘‘no.’’
To those who are watching on C–
SPAN and questioning what has gone
on in this House, yes, they watched it
the last Congress. When we had an
opioid epidemic, we wrote a bill. We
didn’t write a press release, and we
didn’t write a resolution.
b 1445
Or when the National Institutes of
Health, where you could really care
about an individual with healthcare
and solve a problem, we didn’t write a
resolution about giving them more
money. We actually voted for it. We ac-
tually moved it through committee,
and we had a bill and we funded $3 bil-
lion more.
To those who are watching on C–
SPAN, don’t change the channel. Don’t
wonder about the words that were used
before, ‘‘show me your budget,’’ ‘‘show
me your values’’; there is no budget,
and you are probably going to question
their values.
Show me the bill and show me your
values. I guess that is the new line we
should ask, because what does a resolu-
tion do?
Maybe we can all get together and go
to the Rayburn Room today and have a
press release. What? Let’s go further.
Let’s have a press conference. Let’s get
really serious about a problem, and
let’s write a resolution for the floor,
because that problem will still exist.
A lot of people put a lot of effort into
running for office. A lot of people make
a lot of promises, and Americans ex-
pect legislation to solve them, not a
resolution.
You know what is most ironic today?
If they wanted to solve the problem,
there are options there.
If we are worried about a lawsuit, if
we are worried about preexisting condi-
tions, go to Congressman WALDEN’s
bill. Let’s bring that to the floor. It is
not a resolution. We will have to vote
for something different. We will have
to actually vote for a bill.
It is interesting that, on the other
side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, I
heard people were concerned the Re-
publicans were concerned about what
ObamaCare has done, that premiums
have risen, that the promise we were
given that, if you liked your
healthcare, you could keep it. For mil-
lions of Americans, that proved to be a
lie and false.
We are not the only ones who believe
that has been a failure. If that were not
true, why do half the Members on the
other side of the aisle cosponsor a bill
that says Medicare for All? They must
believe it is not working either.
Or maybe they want to take more
healthcare from individuals. I am not
quite sure. The way I look at Medicare
for All, it has got a great name. Any-
body who is 65, they should get Medi-
care, and I will stand with them. But
they shouldn’t take away 158 million
Americans’ private health insurance,
because that is exactly what they do.
Why don’t they make another prom-
ise to the American public and deny
them their healthcare?
Or why don’t they even go further?
For everyone who is on Medicare Ad-
vantage, that goes away as well. Or for
everyone who is on Medicare itself, you
are going to bankrupt it.
You have got that in legislation.
That is not a press release. Why don’t
we bring that to the floor or com-
mittee? Why don’t we debate that?
And, Madam Speaker, when I sat on
this floor and I heard the words used
from the other side of the aisle, from
the leader of that side of the aisle to
say Republicans don’t care about Medi-
care, that was a lie. Medicare part D;
you know, when you talk to seniors,
you know what they are most con-
cerned about? The price of prescription
drugs.
Or for those C–SPAN viewers who
have more than 40 years to watch it,
Republicans were in the majority. Do
you know what they did? They didn’t
bring a press release down with a reso-
lution. They brought a bill. They cre-
ated Medicare part D to lower prescrip-
tion drug prices. It has been one of the
most effective programs around.
And do you know what we had to do?
We had to do it alone because we
passed legislation. We didn’t pass a
press release.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2963
April 2, 2019
Madam Speaker, shame, shame on an
individual who would lie to the Amer-
ican public about their own healthcare,
lie about another side, but, more im-
portantly, say they care about Ameri-
cans’ health and bring a resolution.
I want to see everybody go home this
weekend, go back to their constituents
and tell them what they did about pre-
existing conditions. They passed a res-
olution when they could have passed a
bill.
I happen to be the leader of the Re-
publicans, and I stand here in this well,
in this body, and tell you we support
preexisting conditions. I tell you to
bring his bill up, Congressman WAL-
DEN’s, and we will support this bill on
this floor.
We won’t support shams. We won’t
support press releases, because we care
about Americans’ health. And we will
not support kicking 158 million off
their healthcare.
I know half the body on the other
side has cosponsored that. That is even
further than I have seen before. They
want to end Medicare Advantage.
When are they going to say that to
the seniors? And that is not a press re-
lease. That is something they are real-
ly going after.
If they are serious about their words,
if they believe they care and are con-
cerned about a court case because
maybe they wrote a bill that isn’t con-
stitutional, they could have solved it
today.
You know what we could be talking
about today? They own the majority.
They control the floor.
What is most interesting, the major-
ity of bills that they brought to the
floor in this new majority—they have
brought more bills and resolutions to
the floor than even passed the com-
mittee, but they sat here and told us it
is for the people.
They are about to have 100 days, but
it is 100 days of disappointment. I have
never thought a majority would want
to claim how many press conferences
or how many resolutions they could
pass on the floor, but they are setting
a record. They are setting a record
while they are failing the American
public.
Do you know what they could be
doing right now? If they really cared
about fixing our healthcare system and
protecting Americans with preexisting
conditions, they could do one of the
three things in the face of this lawsuit.
And let’s not lie to the American pub-
lic. They could repeal the individual
mandate. Boom, the lawsuit is gone.
They could reimpose the penalty.
They voted for it before, so why don’t
they vote for it again?
Or they could put a bill on the floor
that explicitly protects preexisting
conditions. The difference is that is a
bill, not a resolution.
Maybe if they had a lot of power,
maybe if they really felt strongly
about this, make a resolution that
even goes to the Senate so the Senate
can talk about it, too.
Or if they really care, make a bill.
Write a bill. Don’t write a press re-
lease. Don’t lie to the American public.
They are smarter than this.
You know, the words I have heard
today, the line that will sit up to
speak, not one of them will use the
term of a bill; not one of them can look
the American public in the eye and say
they are protecting preexisting condi-
tions. But what they can say, Madam
Speaker, is they are denying a bill that
would protect preexisting conditions to
come to the floor because the Repub-
licans offered it.
This is an honorable floor. This is a
floor that makes history. This is a
floor that has changed and shown the
values of America to lead the world,
but it has not done that by doing reso-
lutions. It is a shame that we are try-
ing to put a resolution on the floor.
Is this why you ran? Is this why you
craved to become the majority?
I didn’t hear any of my constituents
say, ‘‘I want you to go there’’—because
I heard this language. I heard this lan-
guage on the other side, Madam Speak-
er, just from the last speaker: We will
fight in court. We will fight on the
floor. We will fight in the public’s opin-
ion.
Do you know what fighting means if
you want to succeed? Put a bill. I
didn’t know fighting was writing a
press release. Don’t take America’s
time and don’t waste it, because that is
exactly what they are doing.
Do you want to tell stories? Go tell
the stories to the individuals who are
concerned about this. Go tell those in-
dividuals you did nothing to solve it.
Go tell those individuals you denied a
bill to come to the floor that could
solve the problem.
Be honest, but stop wasting our time.
And if you don’t want to lead, get out
of the way, because we will definitely
solve it.
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD), who
is the vice chair of our Health Sub-
committee.
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to support H. Res. 271. This
resolution, I would say to the minority
leader, is a statement. It is a state-
ment by Democrats of our position on
the Affordable Care Act.
It is not surprising to me that they
would not want the facts to be before
the American people. That is what this
resolution is about.
On day one of his administration,
President Obama announced he would
address the critical need for affordable
healthcare for millions of uninsured
Americans.
He reminded us that nearly 50 mil-
lion Americans were uninsured. Low-
income, childless adults could not ben-
efit from Medicaid.
Millions of seniors were not fully
benefiting from prescription drug bene-
fits under Medicare part D because of
the doughnut hole.
He told us that parents needed insur-
ance on their children to age 26.
And finally, Madam Speaker, Presi-
dent Obama stressed that insurance
companies were increasing premiums
and not providing quality coverage,
and they were discriminating based on
preexisting conditions, high copays,
and higher deductibles.
After much debate, we passed
ObamaCare. It has made a difference in
health accessibility and health out-
comes. It is not a perfect solution, but
it has impacted millions of lives.
We want to make ObamaCare better;
we want to make it more affordable. I
would say to my friend from Oregon,
with bipartisan cooperation, we can do
that, and we can do it effectively.
But Republicans have repeatedly
tried to legislate ObamaCare out of ex-
istence with no replacement. This Con-
gress has repeatedly said ‘‘no’’ to any
repeal.
On February 26 of last year, Repub-
lican plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the
Northern District of Texas contending
that the minimum essential coverage
provision is unconstitutional, and,
since Republicans removed the man-
date penalty, the entire law is uncon-
stitutional. That was their claim.
Three months later, Attorney Gen-
eral Sessions announced that the
Trump administration wouldn’t defend
the minimum essential coverage claim
and that the Trump administration
would argue that preexisting condi-
tions protections should be invalidated.
However, the Trump administration
said that the remaining parts of the
law could be severed or separated and
the law could remain intact.
The Court heard the case and, as we
all know, the Affordable Care Act was
declared to be unconstitutional. It is
now on appeal.
On March 28 of this year, President
Trump changed his position. On appeal,
he is now aligning with the Republican
plaintiffs and thumbing his nose,
Madam Speaker, thumbing his nose
again at this Congress.
The Affordable Care Act, as the
Speaker said a few moments ago, is the
law of the land, and Republicans are re-
fusing to defend it.
Protection of preexisting conditions
is the law of the land, Mr. President.
The final insult came this morning
when President Trump confirmed that
he will ask the higher courts to throw
out the entire law and that he will
have a replacement ready the day after
the election. I am outraged, and so
should the American people be.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. RICE) from the
Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, we stand here today with an-
other in a series of weekly messaging
bills. I wonder what, next week, we will
deal with. I am sure it will be another
whipsaw response to the headlines of
the day.
If you truly want to protect people
with preexisting conditions, as Repub-
licans do, bring forth Mr. WALDEN’s

H2964 April 2, 2019
bill. It has teeth. In the event that this
lawsuit is upheld and the Affordable
Care Act is unconstitutional, it will
protect people with preexisting condi-
tions.
The Speaker, Ms. PELOSI, a minute
ago said that the Republicans’ position
on healthcare was a joke. Well, I will
tell you what is a joke, and that is to
call the Affordable Care Act successful.
The promises on which the Afford-
able Care Act were based were that we
would cover all Americans; that the
premiums would go down; that if you
like your doctor, you could keep your
doctor; and that if you like your insur-
ance policy, you could keep it.
Clearly, almost every existing insur-
ance policy was declared invalid. You
could only keep your doctor if he is in
your plan and your hospital. Premiums
have gone from an average of $225 in
2013, just before the Affordable Care
Act was enacted, to $475, average cost
for an individual policy today, almost a
250 percent increase.
What did we get for that?
Before the Affordable Care Act, 85
percent of Americans were covered. Be-
fore the Affordable Care Act, 85 percent
of Americans were covered. At the
peak, after the Affordable Care Act,
last year, 91 percent of the Americans
were covered. We covered 6 percent
more people, mostly because we gave
them insurance policies with the Medi-
care expansion. We covered 6 percent
more people.
But what was the cost of that? The 85
percent that were already covered had
to pay 250 percent more for their
health insurance. That is completely
absurd.
And don’t lecture me about people
with preexisting conditions. I have a
son who had a congenital heart defect.
I had a son who, as a 7-month-old child,
was in a car wreck and had a brain in-
jury, both preexisting conditions.
b 1500
Throughout their life, they were cov-
ered. For a brief period of time, South
Carolina, like almost every other State
in the country, had protections for pre-
existing conditions before the Afford-
able Care Act. Under the health insur-
ance pool in South Carolina, they had
to pay 30 percent more.
It irritated me as a father that my
children had to pay 30 percent more for
their health insurance, but guess what?
Under the Affordable Care Act, instead
of having to pay 30 percent more, they
have to pay 250 percent more and their
deductibles have tripled.
You call that a success? In what
world is that a success?
Republicans want to protect people
with preexisting conditions. We have
voted repeatedly to do it. We have bills
out there that will do it.
Stop with the messaging, stop with
the lies, and let’s move forward and do
something that actually works. Let’s
move forward and protect people with
preexisting conditions in the event
that this law is declared unconstitu-
tional.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from South Carolina for
his comments.
Mr. Speaker, I would just point out
Gallup just announced in a survey, 65
million Americans, 20 percent, put off
treatment this last year and borrowed
$88 billion to cover their healthcare
costs. So we know there are problems
out there we need to address.
Mr. Speaker, could I inquire as to
how much time each side has remain-
ing?
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CARBAJAL). The gentleman from Or-
egon has 91⁄2 minutes remaining. The
gentleman from New Jersey has 221⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), the chair of
our Consumer Protection & Commerce
Subcommittee.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker,
clearly, we have hit a nerve with the
Republicans on the Affordable Care
Act, which they opposed before it
began, have been opposing it for 9
years, promising to come up with some
sort of a repeal and replace, never
being able to do it, and now standing
up here and saying life was better be-
fore the Affordable Care Act. Amazing.
People with preexisting conditions
love the Affordable Care Act.
Why are we here in the majority
today? Because the American people
came to understand that before the Af-
fordable Care Act, children born with
preexisting conditions from the day of
birth were not able to be covered by
healthcare, that there were limits in
how much insurance companies would
pay per year or per lifetime caps, and
making families live in fear of disaster
and financial chaos.
So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to con-
demn the Trump administration and
their decision to support the repeal of
the Affordable Care Act, not in the
Congress, but now in the courts.
They couldn’t defeat it here. They
tried when they had the majority in
both Houses and could not repeal it.
When I came here, being a woman
was essentially a preexisting condition.
Women paid more for healthcare,
sometimes 40 percent more, just be-
cause we are women. Pregnancy was
very rarely covered by insurance, and
now women are covered for those
things like preventive services, mam-
mograms, pregnancy.
The Affordable Care Act has let peo-
ple 26 years old stay on their parents’
policies.
No wonder the American people have
completely turned around and under-
stood the sham that the Republicans
were offering and support the Afford-
able Care Act.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT).
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr.
Speaker, I would like to thank my col-
league from Oregon for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to this
debate as it has gone on, and the bot-
tom line is, if you listen to the Demo-
crats, you would think that they had
stuck it to the insurance industry with
all of the rules and all of the laws that
they passed.
As we talk about values, I thought I
would give you a few values.
Aetna in 2010 was trading at $27.39 a
share. In 2018, it was $187 a share.
You know who you stuck it to? You
stuck it to the American citizens. You
took the money out of our pockets and
you put it into the hands of the insur-
ance industry.
If you don’t want to talk about
Aetna, let’s talk about United
Healthcare: $29 a share in 2010; in 2018,
$246.54 a share. How did that happen?
If the American citizens were getting
a square deal before the legislation
that you passed, that you could only
pass if the insurance industry didn’t
object, how did United’s stock go from
$29 a share to $246 a share?
If that’s not enough, how about
Humana: $29 a share in 2010 to $246 a
share in 2018. How did this happen?
This happened because you left the
insurance industry exempt from the
antitrust laws of the country.
Now, how did that work out for the
American citizen? We got a mandate by
the Democratic Party to purchase a
product from an industry that is ex-
empt from the antitrust laws of the
country.
Now, there are flaws in the legisla-
tion that you passed. I am amazed at
your refusal to accept that.
You can’t even buy an Affordable
Care Act contract today. Do you real-
ize the next time you can buy it is Jan-
uary 1 of next year?
If you are uninsured right now—you
all have been telling the American pub-
lic, if you are uninsured and you go to
the doctor and the doctor says you
have got cancer, you can get a contract
the next day. It is just not true. You
can’t get it until January 1 of 2020.
It is a poorly worded piece of legisla-
tion. Regardless of the intent, it is a
poorly worded piece of legislation that
moved money from the individual citi-
zens of this country to the pockets of
the insurance industry, and it needs to
be rewritten.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
31⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE).
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge
the leadership of Congressman COLIN
ALLRED, who has been an incredible ad-
vocate for his community in Dallas and
for millions of Americans whose
healthcare President Trump and our
Republican colleagues are trying to
take away.

and over again that he wants to protect

access to healthcare, and he has even
announced recently that he has a se-
cret plan that he will make available
to the American people after the 2020
election.
But as is true with any con man and
charlatan, when you dig a little past
the surface of the President’s words,
the facts tell a much different story.
Last week, the President’s Justice
Department asked a court to eliminate
every single protection and benefit
that the Affordable Care Act has pro-
vided.
Democrats won the majority because
the American people understand that
we are fighting to protect their
healthcare. And now Republicans have
moved away from the Congress to try
to take away healthcare from millions
and millions of Americans in the
courts.
Let’s be clear about what this means.
President Trump wants to repeal the
caps on out-of-pocket costs, he wants
to eliminate the prescription drug sav-
ings for seniors and end the Medicaid
expansion.
If he succeeds in this litigation, it
will be legal for insurance companies
to limit the amount of coverage some-
one can get in their lifetime, it will
deny access to people with preexisting
conditions, and it will allow insurance
companies to sell junk plans that offer
no real coverage for the American peo-
ple.
Democrats have a better plan, and
the minority leader will be happy to
know there are actually bills to do it.
We are going to strengthen the protec-
tions for people with preexisting condi-
tions, we are going to expand access to
insurance for more working men and
women, and we are going to bring down
the costs of prescription drugs with
bills like my legislation, the CREATES
Act, to allow more generic drugs into
the marketplace.
Look, we take a lot of complicated
votes in this Chamber. This is not one
of them.
This vote is very simple. A vote in
favor of this resolution is a vote for ac-
cess to quality, affordable healthcare.
A vote against it is a vote for the inter-
ests of insurance companies at the ex-
pense of working people.
I know where members of the Demo-
cratic Caucus stand. We ran on this, we
are committed to it. We are fighting
every day to protect the Affordable
Care Act and to build on its success
and to improve it.
The Republicans’ last vote was
TrumpCare, which took away health
coverage from 23 million Americans,
and that is why they were rejected in
the midterms.
People want Members of Congress to
stand up and fight to protect their ac-
cess to quality, affordable healthcare,
to protect their access to coverage for
preexisting conditions, to drive down
the costs of prescription drugs, and to
end these junk plans that, in fact,
don’t provide coverage to the American
people.
This resolution is a strong statement
of our position on this.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican
colleagues, don’t be afraid of the reso-
lution, don’t be afraid that it is going
to expose that you actually don’t sup-
port efforts to protect access to
healthcare, because you have an easy
solution to that problem: vote for it.
Show the American people you care
about the quality of their healthcare,
you want to expand access, strengthen
the Affordable Care Act, and support
this excellent resolution.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. JOHNSON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, President Trump’s Department of
Justice letter seeking the invalidation
of the entire Affordable Care Act by
the Fifth Circuit is nothing short of
self-sabotage.
The Trump position in Texas v.
United States would deny coverage for
those with preexisting conditions, dis-
mantle protections on out-of-pocket
costs and the ban on annual and life-
time caps, and the return of the noto-
rious donut hole for seniors on expen-
sive medications would come forward
again.
I support this resolution. It is impor-
tant that we band together to protect
the Affordable Care Act and its protec-
tions against junk insurance policies.
The American people deserve to
know whether their Representative is
going to fight for them and vote to
condemn the DOJ’s actions or if they
will simply fall in line behind this
President on his thoughtless and heart-
less mission to destroy access to the
healthcare system for millions of
Americans.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. WEXTON).
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H. Res. 271, a resolution condemning
the Trump administration’s legal cam-
paign to take away America’s
healthcare.
Here is what healthcare means: it is
the freedom and security to live your
life the way you choose. It can be the
difference between financial security
and bankruptcy, or life and death.
Donald Trump and congressional Re-
publicans want to use the courts to
take health insurance away from 21
million Americans. They want to
eliminate protections for the more
than 133 million Americans with pre-
existing conditions.
Now, the Affordable Care Act is not
perfect, but never in American history
has the uninsured rate been lower than
it is today.
But rather than be honest about
what is working, rather than coming to
the table to work across the aisle and
fix what is wrong, Republicans are
fighting tooth and nail to overturn the
ACA, with no plan except one that was
so bad, they couldn’t pass it when they
controlled both houses of Congress.
Meanwhile, the Democratic majority
is proposing real solutions and smart
healthcare policies that will lower
costs and expand coverage.
The contrast couldn’t be more clear.
Democrats want quality, affordable
health coverage for every American,
and Republicans don’t.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolu-
tion.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER), our resident phar-
macist on the Energy and Commerce
Committee.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act
is not working for too many Ameri-
cans.
I welcome all efforts to lower costs,
to increase choice, and to protect those
with preexisting conditions.
Remember, the very first thing, the
very first floor vote we pushed as Re-
publicans this Congress was to solidify
protections for those with preexisting
conditions. It was the first thing we
did. We did it right out of the gate.
While Republicans have stood ready
to work on lowering costs and increas-
ing choices, so far the Democrats, the
Democratic majority, have only tried
to double down on the ACA.
On the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, the only solution we have seen
from Democrats are partisan bills that
throw billions of unpaid-for dollars at a
broken system, at a failed experiment.
If my Democratic colleagues were se-
rious about helping patients, they
would work with us on reforms to
lower costs and increase choices.
b 1515
The fact is we could vote on inde-
pendent legislation that protects pa-
tients with preexisting conditions. The
fact is, if my Democratic colleagues
were serious about their concerns over
this lawsuit, they could, legislatively,
end this lawsuit once and for all. We
could vote to repeal the individual
mandate. That would immediately in-
validate the lawsuit. They could vote
to reinstate the individual mandate
penalty. That would also stop the law-
suit in its tracks.
But, instead, we are here to vote on a
resolution about politics, not solu-
tions. It is clear that Democrats would
much rather score political points than
to protect the ACA.
They would have surprised me 2
years ago, but now the Democratic
Party seems to have already moved on
from the Affordable Care Act. Instead
of truly working on improvements to
the ACA, Democrats are focused on
their $32 trillion plan to kick 152
million people off their insurance for
their one-size-fits-all government-run
healthcare plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2966 April 2, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my Demo-
cratic friends to stop the politics and
to work with us to protect those with
preexisting conditions, to lower
healthcare costs, and to increase
choices for patients.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire about the amount of time that
remains on each side.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 141⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from
Oregon has 51⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON).
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to condemn this administra-
tion’s latest attempt to do away with
the healthcare provided by the Afford-
able Care Act.
The Department of Justice’s decision
to go after the healthcare of millions of
Americans by seeking a ruling that the
Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional
underscores their belief that
healthcare should be a luxury reserved
for the privileged few, only now we
have moved from repeal and replace to
just flat-out repeal. I could not dis-
agree more strongly.
In my home State of Pennsylvania,
the ability to get health insurance re-
gardless of chronic illness has saved
countless lives. Tens of thousands of
my constituents have gotten
healthcare for the first time under the
Affordable Care Act. Those with pre-
existing conditions have received peace
of mind, and many, myself included,
have been able to keep their children
on their health plans even as they be-
come adults themselves.
The administration’s callous decision
to continue undermining the Afford-
able Care Act endangers my constitu-
ents, just as it endangers the lives of
Americans in every district of our
country.
We were chosen to serve in this
House to protect Americans who need
us most, and that means protecting
their healthcare. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this important resolu-
tion.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, it is my
great honor and privilege to yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), the Republican
whip of the House, and an incredibly
important member of our committee.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding and for his
leadership on healthcare.
First of all, Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to this resolution, which has
nothing to do with actually helping im-
prove healthcare, the costs, especially,
that so many millions of people are en-
during, because the Affordable Care
Act is anything but affordable.
Mr. Speaker, let’s keep in mind what
this resolution is about. It is not about
changing any healthcare policy. It
doesn’t do that. It has been made clear.
It is attempting just to try to take
cheap shots at the President while di-
verting attention away from what this
lawsuit that you see moving through
the courts is really all about.
Mr. Speaker, if the healthcare law
that my friends on the other side of the
aisle rushed through Congress and
passed is held unconstitutional, they
have nobody to blame but themselves.
Let’s keep in mind—and they want you
to forget this, Mr. Speaker—and let’s
go back to those days when they
rammed this bill through and the infa-
mous statement: You have to pass the
bill to find out what is in it.
Nobody read that bill who voted for
it. We said back then that it was un-
constitutional.
And, oh, by the way, not only was it
that, but it has actually led to dra-
matic increases in cost for families. So
someone with a preexisting condition—
whom we want to protect, by the way,
Mr. Speaker. But we don’t just want to
protect the fact that they shouldn’t be
able to have costs go up. We want to
help them lower the costs for health in-
surance and lower their premiums.
So many millions of Americans are
not only facing double-digit increases,
but people with preexisting conditions,
in many cases, are facing a $10,000 de-
ductible, so they have no access to
healthcare, Mr. Speaker.
Why don’t we focus on the underlying
problem?
We on the Republican side support
protecting people with preexisting con-
ditions, but we also want to lower their
premiums and lower their deductibles.
The other side wants to see their costs
continue to go up. That is the biggest
difference between the two sides.
We ought to focus on lowering pre-
miums. Let families make those deci-
sions, not unelected bureaucrats in
Washington. That is what we ought to
be focused on. This resolution falls
short.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. SCOTT), the chairman of the
Education and Labor Committee.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker,
too often, we forget what our
healthcare system was like before we
passed the Affordable Care Act.
Before the ACA, healthcare costs
were skyrocketing; insurers could deny
people coverage if they had a pre-
existing condition; policies did not
have to provide essential benefits; and
people were losing their insurance at
alarming rates. Before the Affordable
Care Act, insurers could place annual
and lifetime caps on insurance cov-
erage.
Today, the Affordable Care Act en-
sures that 130 million Americans with
preexisting conditions can have access
to the healthcare peace of mind and fi-
nancial security that comes with qual-
ity, affordable health coverage.
Now, we have heard a lot about what
we can do to make things better. We
have heard about a bill that just pro-
tects those with preexisting conditions.
The problem with that, Mr. Speaker,
is, if you allow people to wait until
they get sick before they buy insur-
ance, they will wait until they get sick
before they buy insurance. Those buy-
ing insurance are, on average, sicker,
and the costs tend to go up. Fewer peo-
ple can afford it. The healthy people
drop out, and the costs go up.
There is a name for this cycle. It is
called the death spiral. Every time
they try to protect those with pre-
existing conditions without the sup-
ports of the Affordable Care Act, there
is a death spiral out of control.
In Washington State, for 3 years,
they tried that. In the 3 years, nobody
could buy insurance.
New York was in the death spiral
when we passed the Affordable Care
Act. When we passed the Affordable
Care Act, the costs for individual in-
surance dropped more than 50 percent.
So we know we just can’t protect
those with preexisting conditions with-
out the supports and tax credits avail-
able under the Affordable Care Act.
But we do know what a replacement
plan looks like.
The Republicans voted on such a
thing. It was actually evaluated by the
Congressional Budget Office, finding
that, if the bill passed, about 20-some
million fewer people would have insur-
ance.
They talk about costs. Under their
plan, the costs would go up 20 percent
the first year. Insurance policies would
not have to cover essential benefits, as
they do now, and those with pre-
existing conditions would lose many of
their protections.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this resolution and support
people with preexisting conditions so
that they can have access to the care
they need to live healthy and fulfilling
lives.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I think we
have had a very important debate
today. I just wish that that debate had
occurred on H.R. 692. This is the legis-
lation that we should put in place in
case the decision that the judge made
in the Texas case that said ObamaCare
was unconstitutional is upheld. If that
is upheld, then there is going to be this
problem, this gap that everybody is
talking about.
This is an honest attempt to make
sure there is a safety net for people
with preexisting conditions, H.R. 692.
You are welcome to cosponsor it. I
wish we would move it. I always think
maybe it is the old Eagle Scout in me
that you are always supposed to be pre-
pared and ready and that you help peo-
ple.
I will tell you, Republicans also be-
lieved we should take care of people
with preexisting conditions. Repub-
licans also supported getting rid of life-
time caps on insurance policies and
many of the other things you have
heard about today, and we will con-
tinue to.
But we also led the effort to deal
with the Nation’s opioid crisis, made it

bipartisan, brought it to the floor, and
it became law.
When seniors couldn’t afford their
medicines, it was Republicans, under
George W. Bush, who put Medicare part
D into law, and we had to fight Demo-
crats to do that. Then seniors didn’t
have to go to Mexico or Canada or
somewhere to get their drugs anymore.
It has been highly successful. The costs
are 40 percent or more less than what
the Congressional Budget Office said it
would be, and premiums have remained
low. Now we need to do some mod-
ernization there.
Republicans also passed the longest
extension of children’s health insur-
ance in the history of the country: 10
years, fully funded. Democrats voted
against it over and over again on this
House floor less than a year ago.
Community health centers, an in-
credibly important part of our net-
work, I led the effort to get them fund-
ed at the highest levels ever. That
funding is going to run out, but we
don’t have a plan from the Democrats
yet. We are told we are not even going
to have a budget on how to go forward.
I think we can find bipartisan con-
sensus there.
We are working together right now
and will have a markup tomorrow in
the Energy and Commerce Committee
to address the drug issue and the cost
of drugs. As I said earlier, I can’t re-
member a President of the United
States more engaged in getting better
prices for consumers than this one.
Donald Trump has led the country in
an initiative to drive down the cost of
drugs, and Congress is responding in a
bipartisan way, and that is a good
thing. We should do that here, Mr.
Speaker.
The resolution before us today, if you
are just watching or listening to my
colleagues, is just that. it is a resolu-
tion. It will never leave the House be-
cause it is only for the House. It is the
taxpayer-funded equivalent of a press
release; that is all it is.
And we know that there are Members
who never have accepted the outcome
of the 2016 election, and no matter
what the President says or does, they
want to do a resolution or attack him.
Yet the American people want us to
come here and get our work done and
stand up for them.
So rather than that resolution, I
genuinely wish that H.R. 692, a bill
that would protect people with pre-
existing conditions, was what we were
voting on today. We stand ready to
work with Democrats to get that done
and provide that safety net that these
Americans need.
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this
resolution, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, before I talk about H.
Res. 271 which is before the House
today, I want to respond to my ranking
member’s statements about H.R. 692.
This is the bill that he repeatedly has
mentioned on the Republican side.
I want to point out that the Repub-
lican bill, H.R. 692, under that legisla-
tion, you could theoretically buy insur-
ance if you have a preexisting condi-
tion; but it is very deceptive because
the bill will still allow insurers to set
premiums based on health status, re-
sulting in individuals with preexisting
conditions being charged substantially
more or priced out of the market.
The Republican bill does not include
critical ACA consumer protections, in-
cluding community rating, essential
health benefits requirements, and an-
nual or lifetime prohibitions. Basi-
cally, the GOP bill would allow insur-
ance companies to once again discrimi-
nate against 130 million Americans
with preexisting conditions. They
would be priced out of coverage be-
cause they wouldn’t be healthy enough.
Individuals with preexisting conditions
like cancer or diabetes could face ex-
tremely unaffordable premiums and,
again, be priced out of the care that
they desperately need.
The GOP bill would also put a signifi-
cant financial burden on older Ameri-
cans, while doing very little to lower
costs for young adults. This Republican
bill leaves Americans worse off and
does nothing, really, to protect people
with preexisting conditions, in reality.
Now, if I could speak again in sup-
port of H. Res. 271, which is before us
today, that condemns the Trump ad-
ministration’s legal campaign to take
away Americans’ healthcare.
As you know, last Monday night, the
Justice Department filed a brief saying
that they wanted the court to repeal
the Affordable Care Act in its entirety.
b 1530
The Trump administration’s an-
nouncement last week that it would
actively support this frivolous lawsuit
striking down the entire Affordable
Care Act shows the President’s shame-
less disregard for the health and well-
being of the American people, in my
opinion.
If the Trump administration got its
way in court and the ACA is struck
down, tens of millions of Americans
would lose their health coverage over-
night. Hundreds of millions would im-
mediately lose protections for pre-
existing conditions, and we would be
sent barreling back to the days of life-
time limits and price discrimination
against women based on their gender.
Republicans had their chance to re-
peal and replace the ACA, and the
American people overwhelmingly re-
jected their plan. And now by refusing
to defend the ACA in court, the Trump
administration is asking the courts to
do what President Trump and the Re-
publican Congress could not do, and
that is repeal the ACA and all the pro-
tections that it includes for the Amer-
ican people.
Mr. Speaker, I have heard my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
repeatedly claim that they stand for
protections for people with preexisting
conditions and for other protections in-
cluded in the Affordable Care Act.
Well, now is your chance to show it.
We have an opportunity today to
send a clear message that we will not
support this reckless attack that im-
perils the well-being of millions of
hardworking Americans.
The time for empty promises has ex-
pired. It is time to act. The Trump Ad-
ministration is determined to destroy
protections for preexisting conditions
and to tear down every last benefit
guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act,
and today’s vote is an opportunity to
stand up in solidarity against this
heartless attack.
I urge all of my colleagues to join me
in supporting H. Res. 271, to send a
clear message: We will not stand idly
by while the Trump administration
wages an all-out assault on Americans’
healthcare.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to make
a few comments on my bill, H.R. 692, known
as the Pre-Existing Conditions Protection Act
of 2019.
As we’ve made clear today, Republicans
have long believed that pre-existing condition
protections are an essential part of our na-
tion’s health care markets.
These assurances give patients and families
who have suffered from or are battling pre-ex-
isting conditions peace of mind. As a nation,
we will not go back to the days when patients
could be denied care or charged more than
their peers because of their pre-existing condi-
tion.
The Pre-Existing Conditions Protection Act
has 45 cosponsors and would lock in existing
protections for patients.
It aims to achieve three important goals for
patients: guaranteed access to coverage; a
prohibition on pre-existing condition benefit ex-
clusions; and, a ban on premium rating based
on health status.
This bill reaffirms the commitment by House
Republicans to uphold these three safeguards,
commonly defined as the principle pre-existing
condition protections in Obamacare.
And we can build on this foundation if nec-
essary to adapt to potential changes in law or
decisions from the courts in order to ensure
our citizens who have pre-existing conditions
are protected.
In the first few months of the new Congress,
Democrats have already voted down multiple
attempts to lock in a commitment to legislate
on pre-existing condition protections. Instead,
they’d rather score political points on an issue
that we actually have agreement on.
This bill represents the desire of House Re-
publicans to maintain these crucial protections
for patients.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as
the first registered nurse elected to Congress,
I can attest to the importance of the Affordable
Care Act in improving our country’s health
care, especially for the 133 million Americans
living with pre-existing conditions—of which
11.5 million live in my home state of Texas.
Today, we bring a resolution to the floor that
reaffirms our support of the Affordable Care
Act and defends its protections. It is clear as
day that this president and his administration
will stop at nothing to tear down the very law

erage to millions of Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2968 April 2, 2019
I urge my Republican colleagues to join us
to protect the health care of all our constitu-
ents. We cannot stand silent when our health
care system is thrown into chaos.
I urge my colleagues to support this resolu-
tion.
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support
of H. Res. 271, Condemning the Trump Ad-
ministration’s Legal Campaign to Take Away
Americans’ Health Care.
Last week, the Trump Administration
launched a monstrous attack on our nation’s
health care system and on the people of our
country when it was announced that they
would be joining the 18 Republican state attor-
neys general in support of the Texas vs.
United States lawsuit to strike down the en-
tirety of the Affordable Care Act. By joining
this lawsuit, the Trump Administration dem-
onstrated they do not believe Americans
should have access to comprehensive, afford-
able health insurance or that the 130 million
Americans with preexisting conditions should
be protected.
I’ve already heard from many constituents
who are frightened about losing protections for
their preexisting conditions, panicking about
being able to afford their medical bills, and
worried about where they can go to get their
health insurance if this lawsuit succeeds.
For those enrolled in the Affordable Care
Act, if this lawsuit is successful, 13 million
Americans who gained health insurance
through the Medicaid expansion will lose their
health insurance; the 9 million Americans who
rely on tax credits to help them afford their in-
surance plan will no longer be able to afford
their insurance; and the 130 million patients
with preexisting conditions could be denied
coverage or charged more.
Since the Affordable Care Act was signed
into law over 20 million Americans have
gained health insurance that requires cov-
erage for preexisting conditions; disallows
charging sick consumers more; allows children
to stay on their parent’s health insurance until
the age of 26; and provides coverage for pre-
ventive health services with no cost sharing.
The insurance reforms of the ACA protect
every American, including those who get their
health insurance through their employer. Every
insurance plan today is required to cover ten
basic Essential Health Benefits; there are no
longer lifetime limits; and women can no
longer be charged more because they are fe-
males. All of this is at risk if this lawsuit suc-
ceeds, and the Trump Administration dem-
onstrated their total disregard for the con-
sequences of its actions on the people of our
country last week.
On the first day of the 116th Congress the
House voted to intervene in this lawsuit on be-
half of the tens of millions of Americans who
rely on and have benefited from the ACA.
Today, we renew our promise to the American
people that we will fight this Administration’s
sabotage and do everything to protect, defend
and improve the ACA.
The resolution we’re considering today con-
demns the Texas vs. United States lawsuit
and the Trump Administration’s recent actions
to intervene to seek the invalidation of every
provision of the ACA. It calls on the Depart-
ment of Justice to protect Americans with pre-
existing conditions, cease their efforts to de-
stroy access to affordable health care, and re-
verse its position in the court case. I urge my
colleagues to support this timely and critically
important resolution we are considering today
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong and unequivocal support for H. Res.
271 as well as the underlying resolution and
ask all Members to join me in supporting this
resolution which condemns the Trump Admin-
istration’s ongoing legal campaign to take
away health care from more than 100 million
Americans and to make health care dramati-
cally less affordable for those fortunate
enough to be insured.
I thank Congressman ALLRED, my Texas
congressional delegation colleague, for intro-
ducing this important resolution.
As a new member of Congress who un-
seated an opponent who voted to repeal the
Affordable Care Act dozens of times, the gen-
tlemen from Texas knows first-hand how im-
portant and critical access to affordable, high
quality, accessible health care available to ev-
eryone, including those with pre-existing con-
ditions, to the well-being of American families.
Because of the passage of the Affordable
Care Act, the national uninsured rate has
been slashed from 14.8 in 2012 to 8.8 percent
in 2018.
Texas has long led the nation in rate of un-
insured so the comparable rates are 24.6 and
15 percent, respectively.
Mr. Speaker, I distinctly recall a candidate
for the highest public office in the land saying
‘‘Obamacare is a disaster’’ and appealing for
voters to support him with this question:
‘‘What have you got to lose?’’
The question deserves a response so I
hope that person, who occupies the Oval Of-
fice, is listening to my answer.
The Affordable Care Act, or ‘‘Obamacare,’’
has been an unmitigated success to the more
than 20 million Americans who for the first
time now have the security and peace of mind
that comes with affordable, accessible, high
quality health care.
Mr. Speaker, Tip O’Neill used to say that
‘‘all politics is local’’ so let me share with you
how Obamacare has dramatically changed
lives for the better for the people in my home
state of Texas.
1.874 million Texans who have gained cov-
erage since the ACA was implemented could
lose their coverage if the ACA is entirely or
partially repealed or invalidated.
1.1 million Texans who purchased high
quality Marketplace coverage now stand to
lose their coverage if Texas v. United States,
No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.), the lawsuit
brought by Republican Governors, and now
whole-heartedly supported and aided by the
Trump Administration were to succeed.
913,177 individuals Texans who received fi-
nancial assistance to purchase Marketplace
coverage in 2016, averaging $271 per indi-
vidual, are at risk of having coverage become
unaffordable if the Republican Congress elimi-
nates the premium tax credits.
1.1 million Texans could have insurance if
all states adopted the ACA’s Medicaid expan-
sion; these individuals will not be able to gain
coverage if the Republican Congress elimi-
nates the Medicaid expansion.
508,000 kids in Texas who have gained
coverage since the ACA was implemented are
also at risk of having their coverage rolled
back.
205,000 young adult Texans who were able
to stay on a parent’s health insurance plan
thanks to the ACA now stand to lose coverage
if the Republican Congress eliminates the re-
quirement that insurers allow children to stay
on their parents’ plans until age 26.
646,415 Texans who received cost-sharing
reductions to lower out-of-pocket costs such
as deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance are
now at risk of having healthcare become
unaffordable if the Republican Congress elimi-
nates cost-sharing reductions.
10.28 million Texans who now have private
health insurance that covers preventive serv-
ices without any co-pays, coinsurance, or
deductibles stand to lose this access if the Re-
publican Congress eliminates ACA provisions
requiring health insurers to cover important
preventive services without cost-sharing.
Women in Texas who can now purchase in-
surance for the same price as men are at risk
of being charged more for insurance if the
ACA’s ban on gender rating in the individual
and small group markets is invalidated.
Before the ACA, women paid up to 56 per-
cent more than men for their health insurance.
Roughly 4.5 million Texans who have pre-
existing health conditions are at risk of having
their coverage rescinded, being denied cov-
erage, or being charged significantly more for
coverage if the ACA’s ban on pre-existing con-
ditions is struck down.
346,750 Texas seniors who have saved an
average of $1,057 each as a result of closing
the Medicare prescription drug ‘‘donut hole’’
gap in coverage stand to lose this critical help
going forward.
1.75 million Texas seniors who have re-
ceived free preventive care services thanks to
ACA provisions requiring coverage of annual
wellness visits and eliminating cost-sharing for
many recommended preventive services cov-
ered by Medicare Part B, such as cancer
screenings, are at risk of losing access to
these services if congressional Republicans
go forward with their plan to repeal the ACA.
The Affordable Care Act works and has
made a life-affirming difference in the lives of
millions of Americans, in Texas and across the
country.
This is what happens when a visionary
president cares enough to work with a com-
mitted and empathetic Congress to address
the real issues facing the American people.
You want to know why the American people
have Obamacare?
It is because Obama cared.
The same cannot be said about this Repub-
lican president and congressional Republicans
who have made careers of attacking and un-
dermining the Affordable Care Act’s protec-
tions and benefits for the American people.
I urge all Members to vote for H. Res. 271
and send a powerful message to the President
and the American people that this House will
not stand idly by as this Administration tries to
take away health care from more than 130
million persons.
Instead, this House will resist by all constitu-
tional and appropriate means, including op-
posing this Administration in the courts and by
passing the ‘‘Protecting Pre-Existing Condi-
tions and Making Health Care More Affordable
Act of 2019,’’ which will lower health insurance
premiums with strengthened and expanded af-
fordability assistance by:
1. strengthening tax credits in the Market-
place to lower Americans’ health insurance
premiums and allows more middle-class indi-
viduals and families to qualify for subsidies;
2. ensuring that families who don’t have an
offer of affordable coverage from an employer
can still qualify for subsidies in the Market-
place; and,

3. providing funding for reinsurance, to help
with high-cost claims, improve Marketplace
stability, and prevent the Administration’s sab-
otage from raising premiums.
The ‘‘Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and
Making Health Care More Affordable Act of
2019,’’ will also strengthen protections for peo-
ple with pre-existing conditions by curtailing
the Administration’s efforts to give states waiv-
ers to undermine protections for people with
pre-existing conditions and weaken standards
for essential health benefits.
These improper waivers leave consumers
with less comprehensive plans that do not
cover needed services, such as prescription
drugs, maternity care and substance use dis-
order treatment.
Another way the ‘‘Protecting Pre-Existing
Conditions and Making Health Care More Af-
fordable Act of 2019,’’ protects consumers is
by prohibiting insurance companies from sell-
ing junk health insurance plans that do not
provide coverage for essential medical treat-
ments and drugs, or cover people with pre-ex-
isting medical conditions.

the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 770 Ayrault Road in Fairport,

The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 540
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. LOUISE AND BOB SLAUGHTER POST
OFFICE.
(a) DESIGNATION.—The facility of the
United States Postal Service located at 770
Ayrault Road in Fairport, New York, shall
be known and designated as the ‘‘Louise and
Bob Slaughter Post Office’’.
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law,
map, regulation, document, paper, or other
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to

ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and the gen-
tlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs.
MILLER) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Virginia.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia?
There was no objection.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 540,
to designate the facility of the United
States Postal Service located at 770
Ayrault Road in Fairport, New York,
as the ‘‘Louise and Bob Slaughter Post
Office’’.
Representative Louise Slaughter was
a groundbreaking Member of this
House. She served here for 32 years.
She was the first female chairwoman of
the Rules Committee, and she coau-
thored the landmark Violence Against
Women Act. She was also a dear friend.
Born in Harlan County, Kentucky, in
1929, Louise Slaughter was the daugh-
ter of a blacksmith. After graduating
from high school, she went on to earn
a bachelor’s degree in microbiology
and a master’s degree in public health,
both from the University of Kentucky.
After moving to upstate New York
and marrying her beloved husband,
Bob, Louise became active in local
community groups and, eventually, in
politics. She served a number of years
in local elected offices and in the New
York State Assembly.
Louise was first elected to Congress
in 1986, where she eventually rose to
become the top Democrat on the pow-
erful Rules Committee. Tragically and
very sadly, Louise died in March of last
year, and she is sorely missed by all of
us.
Naming a post office in her honor in
her hometown of Fairport, New York,
is maybe the least we could and should
do to honor the distinguished career in
public service of this remarkable
woman.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 540, which names a post office
located in Fairport, New York, in
honor of Louise and Bob Slaughter.
Louise Slaughter was a Member of
the House body for over 30 years. From
1987 until she passed away last year,
Representative Slaughter was a tire-
less advocate for the people of her up-
state New York district.
In addition to her numerous legisla-
tive accomplishments, Representative
Slaughter made a mark on this body as
the first woman to chair the House
Committee on Rules.
Representative Slaughter was an in-
tellectual and a beloved Member of the
House. I urge my colleagues to support
this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
WOODALL).
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I took
my colleague by surprise here. We just
came down from a Rules Committee
meeting, and I appreciate her yielding
me the time.
Mr. Speaker, if you didn’t have the
pleasure of serving with Louise on the
Rules Committee, it looks kind of
strange to have the Louise and Bob
Slaughter Post Office.
I have been here only 8 years, but I
can’t recall us doing that after a couple
out here. Perhaps it is done regularly,
but to serve with Louise—you know,
the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker,
goes into the wee hours of the morning;
2 a.m., 3 a.m., 4 a.m., the Rules Com-
mittee is working, and it is truly Lou-
ise and Bob Slaughter.
Since my first day on the Rules Com-
mittee back in 2011, Louise took me
under her wing. Yes, I was a young con-
servative Republican. Yes, she was an
older—we can say, I think, honestly—
liberal Democrat. She began building
those partnerships with the young
members of the Rules Committee with
each and every committee meeting
that took place.
I don’t know if she was the first one
who said it to me, but she was cer-
tainly one of them. She said: You
know, ROB, of your colleagues on the
other side of the aisle, folks sometimes
think that we are upset with each
other and we are bad people.
She said: I always tell folks, it is not
that the people on the other side of the
aisle are bad people. They are really
good people. They just have some bad
ideas.
She would share that with me from
time to time, that my ideas were
amongst those bad ideas. Her picture
hangs right across from my seat there
today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2970 April 2, 2019
There are so many men and women
in America, Mr. Speaker, who are wor-
thy of celebration, and it seems like we
always make time to talk about those
things that tear us apart, and we just
don’t make enough time to talk about
those things that bring us together.
Louise was a strident, a fighter for
her beliefs, as is any man or woman in
this institution, but she never missed a
moment to try to bring people together
instead of pushing people further apart.
This is a wonderful gesture that the
committee is moving forward today.
I hope that all of my colleagues will
find, amongst their very busy Tuesday,
time to sit back and reflect that they
have an opportunity to be a uniter or
to be a divider. It doesn’t mean you
trade away one iota of who you are and
what you believe. It is just how do you
tell that story, and how do you go
about persuading your colleagues that
it is true.
Louise gave us a wonderful example
every single day of her decade upon
decade of service in this institution,
and I am honored to have sat across
the aisle from her there in the Rules
Committee.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I really
appreciate the gentleman’s comments,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. PERL-
MUTTER).
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman, and Mr.
WOODALL, whose words prompted me to
want to come speak, because I served
on the Rules Committee when we were
in the majority a number of years ago.
Louise was our leader, and she ran that
thing with an iron fist. Excellent
woman, articulate, powerful, in her
tiny little frame. She was somebody
who made us stay on task.
We worked a lot of hours on that
committee, as I am sure my friend
from the Rules Committee would
agree, and she was indefatigable. The
number of hours that the Rules Com-
mittee would meet, and she would
make sure we were on task—and a
great sense of humor, focused, and
smart.
This is really a nice honor that the
committee is bringing in her name and
in Bob’s name. He would be at the com-
mittee almost as much as Louise, and
they were a great team. I just want to
add my word of thanks for this honor
for the Slaughters.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no
further speakers, and I am prepared to
close.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, on a personal note, Lou-
ise Slaughter was an extraordinary
Member of this body. She had a mar-
velous sense of humor. She was an en-
cyclopedia about the procedures of the
Rules Committee, which often mys-
tified many of us. Her heart was in the
cause every day.
The last few years she was here were
tough. She lost her beloved Bob very
suddenly, and she struggled with a lot
of health issues in the last year of her
life. None of it left her daunted.
b 1545
She faced every day with an indomi-
table spirit and will, a commitment to
her values and to fighting for her con-
stituents and for those values.
This is the least we can do to honor
Louise Slaughter and her husband,
Bob. I hope we can do more as we
progress, but it is an honor to have
served with Louise, and it is a privilege
to manage this bill today.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 540.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, on
that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-

colleagues in consideration of H.R. 829
to designate the facility of the United
States Postal Service located at 1450
Montauk Highway in Mastic, New
York, as the Army Specialist Thomas
J. Wilwerth Post Office Building.
Army Specialist Wilwerth’s life was
defined by a call to service. While still
a junior in high school, Thomas felt
the call to serve his country in the
years after 9/11, and he made the deci-
sion to join the Army to defend his
country.
After finishing his senior year, dur-
ing which he also served in the Army
Reserves, Thomas was assigned to the
4th Infantry Division based out of Fort
Carson, Colorado.
In December 2005, Thomas was de-
ployed to Iraq, and he served selflessly
with his division as part of Operation
Iraqi Freedom. While on deployment,
he was tragically taken from us on
February 22, 2006, when an improvised
explosive device detonated near his
Bradley Fighting Vehicle.
At just 21 years of age, Thomas’ trag-
ic death serves to remind us all of the
human cost of war. He demonstrated in
his short life, Mr. Speaker, the kind of
commitment and service to this great
country that is an example to all of us.
Naming a post office in his honor in
his hometown of Mastic, New York, is
the least we can do as a country to
honor and remember a young man who
made the ultimate sacrifice in service
to all of us.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 829 introduced by Representa-
tive LEE ZELDIN. The bill names a post
office located in Mastic, New York, in
honor of Army Specialist Thomas J.
Wilwerth.
Specialist Wilwerth joined the
United States Army while he was still
in high school. He felt called to defend
our Nation after the terrorist attacks
on September 11. After graduating high
school, he was assigned to the 1st Bat-
talion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Bri-
gade Combat Team based out of Fort
Carson, Colorado.
In December 2005, Specialist
Wilwerth was deployed to fight in Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom. On February 22,
2006, Specialist Wilwerth and two oth-
ers in his unit were killed by an impro-
vised explosive device.
Specialist Thomas Wilwerth was 21
years old when he gave his life in serv-
ice to his Nation. I urge my colleagues
to support this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2971
April 2, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN)
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, today, I
rise in strong support of H.R. 829, my
legislation to honor the life and legacy
of Army Specialist Thomas J. Wilwerth
by renaming, in his name, the post of-
fice in his hometown of Mastic, New
York.
Specialist Thomas Wilwerth always
possessed a strong sense of duty to his
country, having participated in the
Junior ROTC program at William
Floyd High School, where I once grad-
uated as well. But it was in our Na-
tion’s darkest hour that 17-year-old
Specialist Wilwerth was driven to en-
list.
During his junior year of high school,
Specialist Wilwerth bore witness to the
unimaginable horror of September 11,
with Ground Zero just under 100 miles
from his high school. Instead of cow-
ering in the face of terror, he shipped
off to basic training that summer and
actually finished high school while
serving in the Army Reserve.
As a member of 1st Battalion, 8th In-
fantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat
Team, 4th Infantry Division based out
of Fort Carson, Colorado, Wilwerth was
deployed to Iraq in 2005 as part of Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom.
It was only 3 months into his deploy-
ment on February 22, 2006, that 21-year-
old Specialist Wilwerth and two of his
fellow soldiers were killed in action
when an explosive device detonated
near has Bradley Fighting Vehicle
while on a routine morning patrol near
Balad, Iraq.
Mr. Speaker, I wish there were more
people who possessed such a strong
sense of patriotism. Even fewer answer
the call at just the age of 17 and sac-
rifice their entire lives and their entire
future to serve in the U.S. military.
Specialist Wilwerth was the best of
who we are. He is the embodiment of
what makes this country the greatest
in the world: the willingness to make
the ultimate sacrifice serving this
most exceptional Nation, and the will-
ingness to lay down one’s life for his
neighbors, for his community, but
most courageously, for those Ameri-
cans he never knew.
Before serving in Congress, I was in
the New York Senate, and I introduced
a bill that also became law, the Spe-
cialist Thomas J. Wilwerth Military
Dignity Act, to ban protests at mili-
tary burials in my home State.
It is my greatest honor to stand here
on the House floor today to speak
about this new legislation in honor of
Thomas.
Specialist Wilwerth is survived by his
loving parents, Elaine and Terry
Wilwerth, and his sister, Kerry. There
are no words to describe the emptiness
this loss left in their hearts and in the
heart of our entire community.
Before I close, I would like to read a
few words from the Wilwerth family
that really drive home why this
straightforward legislation will have
such a profound impact.
The Wilwerth family said: ‘‘Tommy
died so that his fellow Americans could
live a better life. His deep-rooted sense
of patriotism drove him to enlist in the
aftermath of September 11, and he
would have been so proud of his sac-
rifice on behalf of our entire Nation.
‘‘To have his name and legacy dis-
played in the heart of the community
he loved—the community he laid his
life down for—will never bring him
home, but it will ensure his memory
and sacrifice live on in the hearts of
those who call Long Island home.’’
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation, and I thank
both Members who have spoken in its
favor today.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to support this bill, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, as Mr.
ZELDIN indicated, there is nothing we
can do, not this action, that can really
make up for the loss of a loved one,
even in the time of war. But we can, as
a grateful Nation, explain our apprecia-
tion and gratitude for the ultimate sac-
rifice that was made, and that is what
we are doing today.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this piece of legislation, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 829.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ob-
ject to the vote on the ground that a
quorum is not present and make the
point of order that a quorum is not
present.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.
The point of no quorum is considered
withdrawn.
f
CHANGING THE ADDRESS OF THE
CAPTAIN HUMAYUN KHAN POST
OFFICE
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and pass the bill
(S. 725) to change the address of the
postal facility designated in honor of
Captain Humayun Khan.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
S. 725
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. CAPTAIN HUMAYUN KHAN POST OF-
FICE.
Section 1(a) of Public Law 115–347 (132 Stat.
5054) is amended by striking ‘‘180 McCormick
Road’’ and inserting ‘‘2150 Wise Street’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and the gen-
tlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs.
MILLER) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Virginia.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia?
There was no objection.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my
colleagues today in consideration of S.
725, a bill to change the address of the
postal facility designated in honor of
Captain Humayun Khan. Captain Khan
was an extraordinary military officer
and an American hero who lived in this
country since he was 2 years old.
Mr. Khan represented the best of
what it means to be an American.
Growing up, he was captivated with the
writings of Thomas Jefferson and his
writings on freedom. It was at the
school Jefferson founded, the Univer-
sity of Virginia, that Mr. Khan learned
to put those ideas into practice. There,
he joined the Reserve Officers’ Train-
ing Corps.
After graduation, Mr. Khan put his
dreams of becoming a lawyer on hold
to serve the American people on Active
Duty in Iraq.
On June 8, 2004, while serving with
the 201st Battalion of the 1st Infantry
Division, tragically, Captain Khan was
killed. While visiting the Guard per-
sonnel on his day off, Mr. Speaker, Mr.
Khan was killed by an improvised
bomb outside Forward Operating Base
Warhorse.
It is to honor the life and memory of
Captain Khan that we today dedicate
this post office in Charlottesville, the
home of his alma mater and the begin-
ning of his distinguished military serv-
ice, in his name.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of this bill that makes a technical
change to correct the address of a post
office named last Congress.
The post office is named after Cap-
tain Humayun Khan, who sacrificed his
life in service of our country.
Captain Khan served in the Army Re-
serves while he studied at the Univer-
sity of Virginia and was commissioned
as an officer after he graduated in 2000.
In 2004, he was deployed to Iraq, and he
was killed on June 8, 2004.
This bill corrects the address, to en-
sure that the correct facility is named
in Captain Khan’s honor.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
the Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of
H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act, and ask for its

cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.

Speaker, if this unanimous consent re-
quest cannot be entertained, I urge the
Speaker and the majority leader to im-

There was no objection.

ALZHEIMER’S IS A PUBLIC
HEALTH CRISIS
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, Alz-
heimer’s is a public health crisis. It is
fitting that today, the second day of
National Public Health Week, the Alz-
heimer’s Association held their annual
Day on the Hill. That is why I am
wearing purple, to help raise awareness
about Alzheimer’s.
Someone new develops Alzheimer’s
every 65 seconds in the United States.
The cost of caring for those with Alz-
heimer’s and other dementias is around
$290 billion a year in the United States.
That cost is only going to get higher.
In New Jersey alone, there are 180,000
people over the age of 65 who suffer
from Alzheimer’s. Each year, nearly
3,000 of them die from Alzheimer’s.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues join me to raise awareness on
Alzheimer’s. But raising awareness is
not enough. We need to increase re-
search funding, commit to a public
health response to Alzheimer’s, and
support Alzheimer’s planning and care
services under Medicare.
f
RECOGNIZING WORLD AUTISM
AWARENESS DAY AND WORLD
AUTISM MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on World Au-
tism Day, to recognize and support all
children or adults with autism spec-
trum disorder.
In 2018, an estimated 1 in 59 children
in the United States was diagnosed
with some form of autism spectrum
disorder. Notwithstanding these diag-
noses, Americans with autism make
exceptional contributions across our
Nation and around the world.
Each April Autism Speaks celebrates
the start of its signature campaign,
Light It Up Blue. Light It Up Blue is a
unique global campaign to increase un-
derstanding and acceptance for people
with autism.
Today we celebrate World Autism
Awareness Day, and this month is
World Autism Month.
Mr. Speaker, let’s renew our commit-
ment to support the entire inter-
national autism community, including
children and adults with autism, their
families, and caregivers.
Together, we can increase access to
information, encourage heightened un-
derstanding of autism, promote respect
and dignity, and support the services
that assist people with autism to reach
their full potential.

Peter was one of Sudan’s ‘‘Lost
Boys,’’ he resettled in Philadelphia,
and attended La Salle University,
where I taught for 10 years. I knew
Peter as a brilliant student and a lead-
er. He later went on to Harvard and to
Cambridge.
He is a dedicated peace activist who
co-founded South Sudan Young Lead-
ers Forum. In his work, he has criti-
cized South Sudan’s leaders for failing
to secure a permanent peace for their
people.
Incredibly, Peter is now under inves-
tigation for crimes including treason
and terrorism. If charged and con-
victed, Peter could be sentenced to
death. In reality, he is being persecuted
for his speech.
I call on President Kiir to release
Peter and all other political prisoners
in South Sudan.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
RICHARD D. WESLEY
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Rich-
ard D. Wesley, who retired from being
a Savannah River pilot after over 40
years of guiding ships to port through
the Savannah River.
This expertise cannot be overstated.
An incredible asset to our economy in
coastal Georgia, river pilots risk their
lives by jumping onto moving con-
tainer ships, and then guiding them
safely into harbor, keeping the ship
itself, the cargo on board, and the en-
tire area’s economy moving forward.
A graduate of the Maine Maritime
Academy in 1976, Mr. Wesley has pi-
loted over 11,000 ships safely in and out
of Savannah River. These trips in-
cluded nearly any situation you could
imagine; for example, Coast Guard vis-
its that discovered stowaways, along
with previously undiscovered contra-
band.
He has also seen the ships change
dramatically over his tenure, going
from 460 feet in length to around 1,200
feet in length. But, all of this accumu-
lated experience over the years enabled
him to mentor up-and-coming bar pi-
lots through any situation, and to en-
sure that they are also going to have
safe careers, which keep the economy
of our State moving.
Thank you for your work, Mr. Wes-
ley, and enjoy your retirement.

IF THIS LAWSUIT SUCCEEDS, CEN-
TRAL VIRGINIANS WILL BE LEFT
BEHIND
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker,
last week the administration asserted
that the Affordable Care Act should be
invalidated in Federal court. If this ef-
fort succeeds, protections for those
with preexisting conditions would van-
ish.
Approximately 51 percent of central
Virginians under the age of 65 have a
preexisting condition. If this effort suc-
ceeds, we would see the return of caps
on lifetime coverage, and those over 65
could be forced to pay higher Medicare
premiums.
If this effort succeeds, we would lose
the ability to keep our children on our
insurance plan until age 26. In Vir-
ginia, where we just saw Medicaid ex-
pansion become law, this would be up-
ended as well.
If efforts to scrap our healthcare sys-
tem succeed, Medicaid expansion would
be completely gutted, and with it, our
efforts and ability to deal with the
opioid epidemic across our State.
Right now, we need a bipartisan ef-
fort to stabilize and fix our healthcare
system, not a hyperpartisan lawsuit fo-
cused on settling old scores.
Central Virginians deserve better. We
are here to solve problems, and if there
is a problem with our healthcare sys-
tem, we should fix it, not upend our
system, not hurt those with pre-
existing conditions, not get rid of the
prohibition on lifetime caps, not elimi-
nate a provision that allows young peo-
ple to stay on their parents’ insurance.
This is why, among the other efforts
we are making in this body, I am proud
to cosponsor the Protecting Pre-Exist-
ing Conditions and Making Healthcare
More Affordable Act of 2019.

HONORING CORPORAL HERMAN
JENKINS TURNING 100 YEARS OLD
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Herman Jenkins, a na-
tive Floridian, African American, and
World War II veteran who, today, turns
100 years old.
Mr. Jenkins enlisted in the United
States Army in 1943 when he was 24
years old, was stationed in northern
France, and fought to defend Western
civilization against the Nazi regime.
He rose to the rank of corporal and
received numerous recognitions, in-
cluding the Conduct Medal, the Amer-
ican Theater Ribbon, and a World War
II Victory Ribbon.
After being honorably discharged in
1946, he returned to Lakeland, Florida,
where he married his wife, Essie Mae
Bryant, and together gave birth to
their daughter, Sheila.
Upon returning to Lakeland, Mr.
Jenkins entered the retail industry and
enjoyed a successful career as a man-
ager of several stores in our commu-
nity. He also owned his own photog-
raphy business and continues to be a
skilled photographer, chef, and musi-
cian. However, his greatest passion is
being a loving husband to his wife,
Essie, daughter, Sheila, four grand-
children, and 11 great-grandchildren.
Mr. Jenkins has made a permanent
and positive impact in defending our
Nation and building our community,
and for that, sir, I thank you. I wish
you a very happy birthday and hope
that your next 100 years are better
than your last.

WE COULD LOSE THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in
the 2016 election, as the candidate who
now is in the Oval Office said that
ObamaCare is a disaster, the question
was asked: What do you have to lose?
Well, now we know. It is the Afford-
able Care Act, which has provided 20
million Americans, for the first time,
with security and peace of mind in
healthcare.
I rise to support H. Res. 271, and I
thank the gentleman from Texas, my
colleague, COLIN ALLRED, because we
know that the Texas case is the epi-
center of destruction of the Affordable
Care Act.
The administration’s flip on us to
now be against the position of survival
of the Affordable Care Act tells us we
have a lot to lose: 1.8 million Texans
have gained coverage; 1.1 million Tex-
ans have purchased high-quality mar-
ketplace coverage; 913,000 individual
Texans have received financial assist-
ance.
More importantly, there are 1.1 mil-
lion Texans who have insurance. If all
the States adopted ACA’s Medicaid, we
would have that as well. We did not do
it.
But, as well, Texans have no lifetime
caps. They have the ability to have
their children on their health insur-
ance plans.
This is a tragedy. Mr. Speaker, I con-
demn the action of the administration
in filing their opposition to the Afford-
able Care Act.

as H.R. 962, which so far has been
blocked by the majority in this House.
I am willing to bet most Americans
assume that doctors and nurses would
do everything they can to help a baby
who has somehow miraculously sur-
vived an abortion. You would be sur-
prised and saddened to know that that
is not always the case.
In 2002, Congress recognized the sim-
ple fact that an infant who survives an
abortion is, indeed, a person. So why is
there still no legal protection for those
newborn babies who have been born
alive after a failed abortion attempt?
It is past time to hold abortion pro-
viders accountable for ensuring the
best possible care for any newborn
baby regardless of whether that baby
happens to survive an abortion. We
must vote to protect the sanctity of
newborns, and I hope the American
people will call their Member of Con-
gress and have them sign on to this dis-
charge petition and support this act.

EQUAL PAY DAY
(Ms. STEVENS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I am
here today to recognize Katherine
Johnson, Dr. Christine Darden, Doro-
thy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and the
hundreds of women in STEM who made
incredible contributions to our country
and to the cause of scientific research
and exploration.
Katherine and her team of mathe-
maticians and engineers were pivotal
to one of our Nation’s greatest tri-
umphs: landing the first man on the
Moon. Yet, as Black women in Amer-
ica, they faced pervasive discrimina-
tion. They were subjected to seg-
regated facilities and their careers
were stifled by an explicit and implicit
culture of racism and misogyny.
I will also note that today is Equal
Pay Day and that the gender pay gap is
even more stark for women of color. It
takes a Black woman 7 months longer
to earn what a man takes home in 1
year, which is why I have been a strong
supporter of the Paycheck Fairness
Act.
I will further note that we were sup-
posed to send the first all-woman space
walk on March 29 up into outer space,
but we had to cancel that trip because
of lack of proper suits for women. We
must do better.
Katherine Johnson, Dr. Christine
Darden, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jack-
son, and the hundreds of other women
in STEM were never properly recog-
nized for their brilliance and deter-
mination, which is why I, as a Member
of Congress, am a cosponsor of the Hid-
den Figures Congressional Gold Medal
Act.
f
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, more
than 4 million women in the United
States experience physical violence by
a domestic partner every single day.
This staggering statistic underscores
the great importance of the Violence
Against Women Act reauthorization.
This critical legislation, which I am
proud to cosponsor, provides the sup-
port and protections that victims of
sexual assault and domestic violence
need and deserve.
In my community, we have many or-
ganizations, like the Willow Domestic
Violence Center, that provide life-
saving services to women in need and
rely on funding authorized by the Vio-
lence Against Women Act to operate.
I am especially pleased that this re-
authorization includes vital provisions
to keep guns out of the hands of those
accused of stalking or dating violence.
I look forward to the passage of this
important legislation and will continue
working with my colleagues in the
House to advance policies that support
and empower women and ensure a safer
community for all people.

MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to speak to the importance of honoring
our government handshake agree-
ments.
Medicare and Social Security are
cornerstones of America’s safety net.
Social Security enables millions of
Americans to retire with invaluable
peace of mind, and Medicare is an ef-
fective tool that provides greater
healthcare to millions and millions of
Americans.
These programs are a golden hand-
shake agreement between the Federal
Government and the people of the
United States that must be honored,
and I will not stand for any attempts
to undermine our commitment.
Our seniors rely on Social Security
and Medicare, and it is our responsi-
bility to ensure that these programs
are always there for them.
Our word is our bond. Keeping the
promises made to the people is essen-
tial to the success of our Nation and to
the success of our government.
f
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
(Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of reauthorizing the
Violence Against Women Act.
Congress first enacted this bipartisan
law 25 years ago to unite our Nation in
the fight against domestic violence. It
ushered in a new era of protection for
all Americans and continues to provide
essential support so that victims have
the legal tools and resources to seek
justice and receive care.
Domestic violence is a horrific crime
experienced by one out of three women
and one out of four men. We must do
all we can to stop it.
Recently, I visited the WINGS do-
mestic violence shelter on the south-
west side of Chicago, and I was joined
by Chicago Police Officer Gino Garcia.
Gino was only six when his mother, a
Chicago police officer, was killed by
her boyfriend. Gino was inspired to be-
come an officer and now works with
shelters and other domestic violence
organizations.
By reauthorizing the Violence
Against Women Act, we help organiza-
tions like WINGS, and we empower vic-
tims and save lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to support the reauthor-
ization of the Violence Against Women
Act.
f
HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT, NOT A
PRIVILEGE
(Mr. CISNEROS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker,
healthcare is a right, not a privilege.
Unfortunately, I know all too well
what it is like to have family members
without healthcare coverage.
My mother went 15 years without
health insurance, 15 years without see-
ing a doctor. My father used to drive to
Mexico to get his diabetes medication
because he had no insurance to cover
the high cost.
The Affordable Care Act has provided
over 20 million people with insurance
and allowed them to have access to
healthcare; 9,000 of them are in my dis-
trict. It has also provided protections
for those with preexisting conditions,
protections that this administration
and my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle have tried to take away.
I have spoken with so many parents
who may have a child with a heart con-
dition, childhood diabetes, or asthma.
If these protections are taken away, so
many families won’t be able to afford
the necessary surgeries or medications
for these kids.
Let’s do what is right for kids. Let’s
do what is right for families and pro-
tect the Affordable Care Act. Let’s pro-
tect healthcare.

Congress as they seek to repeal the Af-

entire Affordable Care Act. To do so
would threaten the lives of millions
upon millions of Americans, including
130 million Americans with preexisting
conditions.
If President Trump and Republicans
get what they want and the entire ACA
becomes invalidated, then the current
cost of healthcare for millions of peo-
ple will skyrocket.
More than 130 million Americans,
more than one-third of our people, live
with preexisting conditions, and they
would no longer receive protection
under Federal law.
Mr. Speaker, the American people de-
serve a caring President and Congress;
they deserve a President who is com-
mitted to expanding access to afford-
able healthcare; they deserve a Con-
gress that is committed to protecting
those with preexisting conditions; and
they deserve a government willing to
stand up to the insurance industry and
Big Pharma, whose profits will soar
even more if the Affordable Care Act is
struck down.
We were elected by the people to
work together to strengthen our
healthcare system, not destroy it. I
thank Representative ALLRED for in-
troducing a resolution condemning the
administration’s attack on the Amer-
ican healthcare system, and I urge its
swift passage through this House and
Senate.

AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
MALINOWSKI). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the
gentleman from California (Mr.
GARAMENDI) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority
leader.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, as I
often do these Special Order hours here
on the floor, I want to start by stating
the fundamental reason I am here and
my Democratic colleagues are here. I
harken back to a very famous Amer-
ican, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This
is actually etched in stone down at his
memorial on the other end of the plaza
here. He said: ‘‘The test of our progress
is not whether we add more to the
abundance of those who have much; it
is whether we provide enough for those
who have too little.’’
That ‘‘we provide enough for those
who have too little,’’ a fundamental
value, a fundamental statement of pur-
pose, a fundamental statement of why
we seek elective office, not to provide
more for those who have much, but,
rather, for those who have too little.
In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I do not
understand why a man who says he has
much would purposely set out to harm
those who have too little.
Why, Mr. Speaker, would the Presi-
dent of the United States put in place
a policy to take healthcare away from
Americans? Obviously, he has much, or
at least he says he does. But millions
of Americans rely upon the Affordable
Care Act for their insurance, for their
health insurance, literally for their
ability to stay alive.
Why would the President of the
United States ask the court to repeal,
to find unconstitutional, the Afford-
able Care Act that has provided insur-
ance coverage to more than 20 million
Americans and healthcare benefits to
millions upon millions more?
Why would our colleagues on the Re-
publican side of this aisle fall in lock-
step to support the President’s effort
to take away healthcare from Ameri-
cans?
I do not understand this. Where is the
compassion? Where is the empathy?
Where is the concern for Americans,
not one or two, but millions upon mil-
lions of Americans who have come to
rely upon the Affordable Care Act to
give them their basic insurance?
More than 20 million Americans
found insurance coverage through the
expansion of the Medicaid program, not
in every State, because there were
State Governors who were willing to go
along with the President and the Re-
publicans and not institute the Med-
icaid expansion. But there are still 20
million more Americans who have
comprehensive healthcare coverage
today.
Why? We must ask the question of
the President and any of his sympa-
thizers: Why would you do that?
It is not just those people who have
been able to get coverage in the Afford-
able Care Act, but it is every senior
who is on Medicare who will lose cov-
erage. Every senior on Medicare has an
annual visit to a doctor to determine if
they have any medical problems, a free
annual check-up. That, too, would dis-
appear.
For seniors who had hundreds of dol-
lars, if not thousands of dollars, in an-
nual expenses for drugs because of the
Medicare drug doughnut hole—yes, the
infamous doughnut hole that was cre-
ated in the expansion of the Medicare
program in 2003—that doughnut hole is
literally closed as a result of the Af-
fordable Care Act.
Eliminate the Affordable Care Act,
Mr. President, and seniors who rely
upon expensive drugs are going to, once
again, pay billions of dollars of addi-
tional costs right out of their pocket.
Here it is: ‘‘Whether we provide
enough for those who have too little.’’
Think of seniors who are in nursing
homes. Most of the Medicaid dollars
are for nursing home care. The expan-
sion will affect them, if it is repealed.
Remember the bad old days when
your insurance policy had a cap, a
$50,000 lifetime cap, maybe a $100,000
lifetime cap? If you had a bad car acci-
dent, you would blow right through
that. If you had cancer, guaranteed
within the first month of treatment,
you would blow through that cap, and
it would come right out of your pocket.
Remember the bad old days when the
great majority of personal bank-
ruptcies were a direct result of medical
expenses?
Mr. Speaker, does the President re-
member those days, that now he wants
to eliminate the Affordable Care Act?
Is that where we are in this country?
How mean-spirited.
Maybe his test of progress is whether
we add more to those who have much.
Look at this. The Affordable Care
Act actually raised taxes on the super-
wealthy. Maybe that is what the Presi-
dent wants, to, once again, give a mas-
sive tax cut to the superwealthy. If the
Affordable Care Act is repealed, the av-
erage tax cut for the superwealthy, the
top one-tenth of 1 percent of Ameri-
cans, will be nearly $200,000 a year. Is
that what our President wants?
Apparently, he took the first half of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s statement
about values and said: Oh, yes, we want
more for the wealthy.
That is precisely what will happen if
the Affordable Care Act is repealed, to
the tune of more than $197,000 for the
top one-tenth of 1 percent of America’s
wealthy.
What in the world? What is going on
here in America that the President of
the United States, in league with many
of our Republican colleagues, would rip
out of the hands of Americans a
healthcare program that is working?
That is not where we are on the
Democratic side of this aisle. We have
fought this fight for 8, 9, 10 years. The
Affordable Care Act passed in 2009 and
2010, and here we are. Our Republican
colleagues gained control of this House
and the Senate, and we fought the fight
over those years to stop the repeal.
Now, the President, once again, is
going around Congress, this time to the
courts, asking the Supreme Court of
the United States to rip out of the
hands of Americans the healthcare
that they have come to rely upon.
We will continue this fight. Not only
will we continue this fight, but we are
stepping up to improve the Affordable
Care Act, and we intend to do it with a
piece of legislation. We call it the Pro-
tecting Pre-Existing Conditions and
Making Health Care More Affordable
Act of 2019, H.R. 1884, protecting pre-
existing conditions.
You heard my colleague, just before I
stood up here, talking about pre-
existing conditions. 130 million Ameri-
cans have preexisting conditions: high
blood pressure, being a woman who
might get pregnant, you name it. We
all, at least 130 million of us, have pre-
existing conditions.
Here is what we intend to do: im-
prove the Affordable Care Act and re-
duce premium costs for consumers by
expanding the eligibility for the pre-
mium tax credit, expanding afford-
ability for working families, protecting
comprehensive coverage for small busi-
nesses and workers, and eliminating
junk insurance policies.

California for 8 years, and I can talk
for hours and hours about insurance
companies that sold junk to people.

make those junk insurance policies un-
available in America.
We would ensure that there would be
comprehensive benefits, like maternity
care. If you talk about family values,
you better talk about maternity care.
We would make sure that the pro-
grams to make people aware that they
can get insurance would be in place.
We would help the States as they
carry out their coverages. We would
make sure that the exchanges were not
eliminated, that they would be strong.
Unlike the President who would elimi-
nate the exchanges, we would strength-
en them.
We have work to do. We are here to
make things better for America, for
the people, and we intend to do so.
Joining me tonight are a couple of
my colleagues.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), a
fellow who has worked on this for
years.
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, back in 1966, at a
healthcare conference, the late Martin
Luther King, Jr., said: ‘‘Of all the
forms of inequality, injustice in
healthcare is the most shocking and in-
humane.’’
I often think of the debate back in
2009 and 2010 when we were trying to
pass the Affordable Care Act. I remem-
ber one day I was conducting a call-in
program on the local radio station. A
gentleman called in and said to me: I
want you to keep your hands off of my
health insurance. I like what I have
got, and I don’t want you and President
Obama messing with it.
b 1715
I assured the gentleman that we were
going to do nothing to interrupt his re-
lationship with his insurance company
or his policy.
But then a little while later, a lady
called in, and she said, Congressman, I
don’t have a question, but I would like
to say something to the gentleman who
just called in. I want to say to him that
I had insurance for 30 years, and I
thought I liked it, until I tried to use
it. When I went for my second treat-
ment for breast cancer, I got a notice,
she said, from the insurance company
that I had used up my lifetime of bene-
fits.
And then she said, I would like to say
to that gentleman, Maybe he likes
what he has because he has never tried
to use it.
And that is what you have reference
to here when you talk about junk poli-
cies. What we did with the Affordable
Care Act was to make healthcare ac-
cessible and affordable for all Amer-
ican citizens.
We created the possibilities of States
expanding Medicaid so that low-income
people could have access to healthcare.
And if you want to know a little bit
about what can be done if we were to,
in some way, get rid of the Affordable
Care Act, just look at the States that
have refused to expand Medicaid; the
number of low-income people today
who still do not have access to
healthcare.
Think about those middle-income
families who had a family member get
sick and find out that they are in
bankruptcy because they are trying to
pay the bills.
The Affordable Care Act is an at-
tempt, like everything else ought to be
here.
If we are talking about education, it
ought to be accessible and affordable.
If you are talking about housing, it
should be accessible and affordable.
Healthcare; accessible and affordable.
And we all know that until we passed
the Affordable Care Act, healthcare
was not accessible and affordable for
all Americans.
We hear the slogan that takes place
throughout this country. We don’t need
to Make America Great Again. Amer-
ica is great. It has always been great.
That is not our challenge.
Our challenge, it seems to me, is to
make the greatness of America acces-
sible and affordable to all Americans;
apply it fairly and equitably.
That, to me, is what this country is
all about.
So I want to thank you, my friend
from California, Mr. GARAMENDI, I
want to thank you for all the work
that you are doing on H.R. 1884, be-
cause I think before we go home this
week, we are going to pass a resolu-
tion, a resolution to condemn this ad-
ministration for attempting to legally
take away healthcare from so many
citizens.
And I want to close with this: You
talk about preexisting conditions. I
think that people tend to think about
preexisting conditions in a way that
deals with people that they know or
can relate to. I want all of our lis-
teners, and those looking on, to just
think of what you are doing.
If you say to a child born with diabe-
tes, a child who didn’t ask to come
here, and even if that child could ask
to come, they certainly wouldn’t ask
to come sick. Diabetes; born with it.
And then the insurance company
says that it is a preexisting condition
and you cannot come on to your fam-
ily’s insurance policies.
If we cannot see the wrongness in
that, I am not too sure anything any-
body says about anything can be ever
wrong in your eyesight.
So I want to thank you so much for
the work that you are doing here. I
want to thank the American people for
keeping our focus on making
healthcare accessible and affordable for
all Americans.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman (Mr. CLYBURN) so
very much. He has been working for
those qualities and values all of his
life, and I really appreciate his coming
to us and bringing us the awareness of
what Dr. Martin Luther King said
about America and about where the
role of healthcare fits into justice in
America.
I see Mr. CICILLINE from Rhode Island
here, the chairman of the Democratic
Policy and Communication Group.
Would you like to communicate with
us?
Mr. CICILLINE. I would be honored
to. I thank the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI), my friend, for
organizing this Special Order hour and
for giving us an opportunity to speak
more about what seems to be a recur-
ring fight here in Congress between
Democrats who are committed to pre-
serving access to high quality, afford-
able healthcare and to our Republican
friends who are committed to undoing
the progress we have made.
I know the gentleman will remember
this. In the last Congress, I think, we
were confronted with 50 or 60 votes to
repeal the Affordable Care Act in its
entirety. And we were able to defeat
each of those efforts.
Then President Trump was elected,
that effort continued, and the adminis-
tration began to administratively sabo-
tage the Affordable Care Act, and even
proposed TrumpCare, which would have
cost 23 million Americans their
healthcare in its entirety.
So now having lost that battle,
Democrats ran an agenda for the peo-
ple of this country.
The first item on that agenda was
driving down healthcare costs, driving
down the cost of prescription drugs,
and preserving coverage for preexisting
conditions.
We won the election. We were put
into the majority, in part because the
American people rejected the Repub-
lican’s relentless effort to destroy
healthcare in this country and wanted
Democrats to come to Congress in con-
trol to build on the success of the Af-
fordable Care Act and make sure that
we continue to protect access to qual-
ity, affordable healthcare.
Having lost in this body on this issue,
now what do the Republicans do? They
take the battle to the courts. Let’s use
the courts to strike down the Afford-
able Care Act.
And we should be very clear, as I
know the gentleman from California
knows, President Trump has claimed
over and over again that he wants to
protect access to healthcare.
In fact, just in the last couple of
days, he now claims he has a secret
plan. It is so good he is going to share
it with the American people after the
2020 election.
But what we know is, unfortunately,
what the President says and what he
does aren’t always the same. Because
the truth is, the President has asked
his Justice Department to go to court
and fight to eliminate every single pro-
tection and benefit that the Affordable
Care Act has provided.
So that means if President Trump
gets his way and our Republican col-
leagues, there will no longer be caps on
out-of-pocket expenses, there will no
longer be savings by closing the donut
hole, so prescription drug costs are re-
duced for our seniors. Medicaid expan-
sion will end. The limits that prevent

insurance companies from limiting the
total coverage over your lifetime, that
ban will no longer exist. You will be
able to deny access to healthcare for
people with preexisting conditions. And
the insurance company will be free to
sell junk plans that offer little or no
real coverage at all.
And so we are back to the same fight.
Democrats have legislation that has al-
ready been introduced to build on the
success of the Affordable Care Act:
To drive down premiums; to expand
access for more working men and
women; to drive down the costs of pre-
scription drugs.
But we are back at it where our Re-
publican friends are now joining this
Republican President in an effort to
use the courts to undo all the progress
we have made on the Affordable Care
Act.
This is going in exactly the wrong di-
rection. We remain committed to make
sure that we do everything we can to
protect access to care and drive down
costs, because we believe healthcare is
a right.
It is not a privilege for a small group
of people. It is a right of every single
citizen of this country.
And I thank the gentleman for con-
vening this Special Order hour, because
amidst the noise, people should know
there is one party here in Washington,
the Democrats, who are fighting to
protect and expand access to
healthcare and drive down costs. There
is another party that is continuing
their effort to repeal the Affordable
Care Act in its entirety, to take away
coverage for preexisting conditions, to
drive up the cost of prescription drugs.
And the American people have the
right to know who is fighting for them
and who is not.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman (Mr. CICILLINE).
It is extremely important that we
continue this fight we fought success-
fully for 8 years, 9 years. And here we
are once again.
The general public, keep in mind,
Protecting Preexisting Conditions and
Making Healthcare More Affordable
Act of 2019, H.R. 1884.
I turn to the gentleman from the
State of New York (Mr. MORELLE). If
you would like to join us and tell us
how all of this affects your constitu-
ency in New York.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI) for his elo-
quence and his leadership on this criti-
cally important issue.
I rise to express my strong opposition
to the Trump administration’s efforts
to repeal the Affordable Care Act and
pull the rug out from millions of Amer-
icans who rely on the ACA for essential
health coverage.
Quality, affordable healthcare should
be a right for every American, and we
should make it easier, not harder, for
individuals and families to get the in-
surance they deserve.
The House majority made a promise
to always offer protections for individ-
uals with preexisting conditions and
fight back against those who seek to
dismantle their fundamental protec-
tions.
That is why I am proud to cosponsor
a resolution to reverse the administra-
tion’s cruel attempts to sabotage care
for Americans in need, and I thank Mr.
GARAMENDI for his leadership with
House Resolution 1884.
We will not allow people with pre-
existing conditions to go back to the
days where they were denied coverage
when they needed it the most. And I
might also say, parenthetically—and I
appreciate very much the gentleman
from California’s leadership as the su-
perintendent of insurance in the State
of the California—I had the privilege of
working on legislation in New York
back in the early nineties as a new
member that introduced community
rating in the State of New York and of-
fered protections for preexisting condi-
tions.
Subsequent to that, I had an oppor-
tunity to serve as the chair of the In-
surance Committee in the New York
State Assembly.
In that role, I was responsible for
helping to implement the Affordable
Care Act in the State of New York.
Many of the protections in the Af-
fordable Care Act were already part of
New York law. I am very, very proud of
that; and continued to work on that as
majority leader of the State Assembly.
But the protections which we, I
think, rely on in New York are not
available to all Americans, and to
those plans which we are not able, as a
state, to regulate, self-regulated plans
and other plans protected by ERISA,
don’t have those protections.
So I think it is critically important
as we continue to move forward that
we work tirelessly. And I will work
with my colleagues to protect and ex-
pand the Affordable Care Act, to lower
costs and ensure hardworking families
everywhere in America have
healthcare that they can rely on.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, if
the gentleman could stand by for a few
seconds.
I knew that he had been in the New
York legislature as a leader in the as-
sembly there. And I had some recollec-
tion of the work he did on insurance
matters.
If he could just talk about the experi-
ences he had when he tried to protect
people with preexisting conditions, and
those issues that he dealt with in the
early nineties, some of the work that
was done and the experiences that he
had there.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my colleague and friend from Cali-
fornia.
You know you understand how it is
for many of us who are blessed to have
either employer-offered health insur-
ance or are in a situation where you
don’t think as much about the costs or
the issues that involve health insur-
ance. But what you find from talking
to people, as many people are not as
privileged as I might be, and really
faced critical decisions about whether
they could have medicine to treat
chronic illnesses or had to make the
decision between that and rent.
Or for people who had—as I have said
on this floor before, I, unfortunately,
lost my daughter to cancer, breast can-
cer, about a year and-a-half ago.
Lauren had good health insurance,
but during her illness, I often thought
about men and women in her cir-
cumstance, what challenges they would
face, even if they are able to defeat the
illness, whether or not those pre-
existing conditions would cause their
insurance premiums to be so high and
so unattainable that the idea of having
quality, affordable healthcare would
simply not be within their reach.
b 1730
This affects millions of Americans.
Whether it is women who plan on be-
ginning a family, starting a family;
whether it is the elderly who have
chronic conditions—you mentioned hy-
pertension; or whether you have diabe-
tes, there are a whole host of condi-
tions. Most Americans have some form
of preexisting condition.
For us to allow the underwriting to
be done with those preexisting condi-
tions in mind would simply put
healthcare out of the reach of most
Americans, quality, affordable
healthcare. That is why I think this is
so important.
I might also add that the Department
of Justice is charged with defending
the laws duly enacted by this Congress
and by the President of the United
States. That is the job of the Depart-
ment of Justice. I find it reprehensible
that this Department of Justice under
this administration would take the
view that they will join in a lawsuit
against a law fully enacted that is the
law of the land of the United States
and seek to overturn it. It is virtually
without precedent.
What is so troubling about it is that
this will leave millions of Americans
without coverage and without health
insurance at a time when we should be
doing everything we can to ensure that
more Americans have access to qual-
ity, affordable care.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Mr. MORELLE so much. Actually,
I didn’t know that the gentleman had
lost his daughter. That tragic illness is
an example of why the Affordable Care
Act is so important, because people
will have coverage. There are no life-
time limits.
Although your daughter was unsuc-
cessful in the treatment, many thou-
sands upon thousands of Americans are
able to get treatment and survive can-
cer or some other debilitating illness.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
so much for his experience, and I thank
him for being here and bringing all
those years of knowledge and experi-
ence to this House and helping us fight
this fight.

me on the floor, Mr. PAYNE. He and I
talk about a lot of different subjects.
Here, we are talking about one that af-
fects every American. I thank the gen-
tleman for joining us.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE).
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Mr. GARAMENDI for once again setting
aside time to talk about the issues that
affect the lives of people across this
country.
I want to start by saying that the
contrast between Republicans and
Democrats on this issue of healthcare
could not be any clearer.
As the gentleman has described in his
discussion of the ongoing legal case
down south, Republicans and the
Trump administration want to make
Americans sick again. They want to
eliminate protections for people with
preexisting conditions.
Let me just stop there. This Nation
was built on a morality that we held
very deeply in this country. But, to
me, it feels like it has been torn apart,
is falling apart, that we do not care
about people who find themselves in
circumstances that they did not create
on their own, that they should alone be
left, because of a preexisting condition,
not to be afforded healthcare.
That is unconscionable. That is prof-
iteering at its worst. It deeply upsets
me that we find ourselves turning our
backs on our brothers and our sisters,
our mothers and our fathers, and our
aunts and our uncles in this country to
say, no, because you have an illness, we
cannot protect you and give you insur-
ance. It is unconscionable.
They want to take the United States
backward, and they are weaponizing
the courts to do what they failed to do
in Congress: repeal the Affordable Care
Act.
I arrived here in 2012, and the Afford-
able Care Act was already the law of
the land. But what I witnessed in my
time here was the over 50 times, close
to 60 times, that the Republicans at-
tempted to repeal the Affordable Care
Act but could never do it. They could
never do it. With the White House,
with the Senate, and with the House,
they still could not do it, because it
was too popular with a lot of Ameri-
cans in this country. They did not lis-
ten to the people. They did not want
the Affordable Care Act repealed.
Now they are trying to go the court
and the executive route and do what
they could not do in this body, which is
the body that determines those mat-
ters.
Democrats, on the other hand, want
to make America healthy. We want to
expand healthcare access. We want to
strengthen the Affordable Care Act. We
want to make sure that people with
preexisting conditions are not denied
insurance coverage.
Now the Trump administration is
fighting to bring healthcare discrimi-
nation back. Well, there is no going
back. More than 200,000 people in my
State of New Jersey who purchased
their insurance through the Affordable
Care Act marketplace have preexisting
conditions.
President Trump wants to make it
easier for insurers to deny coverage. He
is playing politics with their lives.
What my constituents want and need
is for the Affordable Care Act to be
strengthened. The 200,000 New
Jerseyans who purchased their insur-
ance through the Affordable Care Act
should not have their insurance cov-
erage put to risk because of politics.
New Jerseyans and all Americans de-
serve protection, not discrimination.
Let me be clear: The Trump adminis-
tration wants to put lives at risk by
undermining people’s access to
healthcare across this country. The
Trump administration is sabotaging
the Affordable Care Act, and Ameri-
cans are paying the price.
The Trump administration has made
it more difficult to enroll in the Af-
fordable Care Act by increasing website
downtime during open enrollment and
cutting the budget for healthcare navi-
gators, the people who help Americans
determine and figure out what they
need in terms of coverage. They cut
that.
The Trump administration has
stopped finding cost-share reductions,
which lower people’s out-of-pocket ex-
penses.
The Trump administration has
launched a full-scale legal attack on
the Affordable Care Act.
In light of those attacks, let me be
clear about one thing: Democrats will
keep fighting to ensure that all Ameri-
cans’ healthcare is protected. We will
fight in the House. We will fight in the
Senate. We will fight in the courts.
Once again, I thank the gentleman
for his true leadership on the issues
that are facing the American people.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Mr. PAYNE for his consistent
work here on the floor on multiple
issues.
Healthcare issues have always been
at the front of his agenda for him and
his constituents, and he has fought
fiercely since 2012 to see to it that the
Affordable Care Act remains in place.
Mr. Speaker, I am going to put up
one more chart that I think graphi-
cally displays what we have been talk-
ing about here. This is 2010, 2011, 2012,
and 2013. The Affordable Care Act real-
ly took hold in 2013. It took a couple
years to set up the administrative sys-
tems and the like.
You can see in 2014, 2015, 2016, and
2017, the number of uninsured in Amer-
ica went from 44 million down to 27
million, which is just, in large num-
bers, a clear description of what the Af-
fordable Care Act was able to do in
bringing insurance to Americans.
Here we have a President who was
unable to get his wall and decided to go
around Congress and the Constitution
to try to fund the wall by moving
money from one military account to
another so that he could build his wall.
Article I, Section 9 of the Constitu-
tion clearly states that it is the Con-
gress that appropriates money. It says
no money shall be appropriated from
the Treasury without law. Congress
passed a law that said $1.2 billion was
for border security. That is it. Now the
President wants $8 billion, literally
going around Congress and the Con-
stitution.
He is doing it once again with the Af-
fordable Care Act. He was unable to get
Congress to repeal the law, so now he is
going to the court system to try to get
the court to repeal the law.
Hopefully, the court won’t do that.
But if it does, those 20 million Ameri-
cans who will lose their insurance and
those 130 million Americans who have
preexisting conditions and will once
again be open to insurance discrimina-
tion—not able to get insurance, paying
vastly more because they have a pre-
existing condition, like being a woman,
or blood pressure, or diabetes, or any
number of things—those people will re-
member that it was the President who
went around Congress to the courts to
ask the court to strike down the Af-
fordable Care Act.
There is so much at risk. Every sen-
ior on Medicare will see the doughnut
hole come back, and their drug ex-
penses will skyrocket billions of dol-
lars. The free annual checkup that sen-
iors are able to get now will no longer
be available. It goes on and on, all
gone.
I am going to end with this before I
turn this over to my colleagues.
I don’t know that I could ever put
this up enough, when FDR said: ‘‘The
test of our progress is not whether we
add more to the abundance of those
who have much; it is whether we pro-
vide enough for those who have too lit-
tle.’’
In this case, probably close to 27 mil-
lion Americans have too little. They
didn’t have healthcare, and today, they
do. Those are the Americans who had
too little.
Where do we stand? What are our val-
ues? How do we approach this funda-
mental question of America as we go
into the 2020s? Are we for those who
have much, like the President? Or are
we for those who have too little, like
the Americans who were uninsured
prior to the Affordable Care Act?
I will tell you where we Democrats
stand. We, without any Republican
support, created the Affordable Care
Act. We fought over the last decade,
not only to implement it, but to fight
the defensive battle to see that it
would continue.
Now we are going to continue that
fight. We are not going to give up be-
cause our values, our purpose, are with
those Americans who now rely upon
the Affordable Care Act, and, indeed,
with those seniors and with this coun-
try so that we can provide for those in
need.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

IMPORTANCE OF JOURNALISM IN
THE UNITED STATES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from California (Mr.
DESAULNIER) for 30 minutes.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
thank those watching and my col-
leagues who will join me in the next
half hour to talk about journalism, the
importance of journalism in the United
States and the importance of jour-
nalism to democracy.
Abraham Lincoln once said: Let the
people know the facts, and the country
will be safe.
The challenge is, how do we get them
those facts?
For professional journalists, there is
nothing more important. They don’t
always make us who hold office happy.
Sometimes, we disagree with them.
Sometimes, we think they are not
being fair. But they are extremely im-
portant to the success or failure of
American democracy.
b 1745
Neil Postman, in 1985, in his book,
‘‘Amusing Ourselves to Death,’’ wrote
about his own belief in 1985 that how
people got information in journalism
was changing too dramatically, and he
was just talking about the media in
terms of television news. Think about
how much that has changed since 1985.
Mr. Postman talked about the Lin-
coln-Douglas debates and that thou-
sands of people would go and listen to
those debates because Douglas and Lin-
coln took the time to write out what
they would say and how they antici-
pated answering questions. People
would listen without speakers and
without any kind of amplification of
what they were saying—thousands of
people—for as long as 6 or 7 hours, with
a break for dinner.
Mr. Postman’s whole argument was
this was cognitively different, that
when you read something that was pre-
pared over and over again by people
who were really good writers, people
responded differently and they accept-
ed factual information in a different
way than we were learning to accept
facts.
Now, in 2019, with this administra-
tion and with social media and 24/7
news, I think Mr. Postman would be
horrified about how Americans get
their facts, how they cognitively proc-
ess them, and how they engage as
American citizens.
There is nothing more important
than, as Lincoln said and I would
opine, that Americans get journalism
with factual content, with the profes-
sional expertise of people, many of
whom have gone to school, to jour-
nalism schools for undergraduate de-
grees, often for graduate degrees, who
go out to work for not a whole lot of
money but to be able to investigate,
get to the facts, and then commu-
nicate. Too many of us underestimate
those talents. Maybe we have become
spoiled.
But what has happened is a con-
sequence of many things. The business
model has changed. Being from the bay
area, Craigslist changed classified ads,
and that is a revenue source to print
journalism. But now as it moves to dig-
ital, a group of us wants to talk about
what we can do appropriately in Con-
gress and maybe work with—not
maybe, but work with State and local
officials to talk about how we can ap-
propriately support professional jour-
nalism so we can get back to that point
where Americans are engaged in a very
deep way in their discussion with gov-
ernment and, specifically, with local
government.
Most Americans—and maybe it is be-
cause I came from local government—
learn about democracy, oftentimes, at
the local level. They know the people
who are in the city council and on the
school board. An issue comes up. Their
kids start to go to school, and they
take an interest in the governance and
superintendent and the superintend-
ent’s bosses. They care about the cur-
riculum. Maybe there is a land use de-
cision at their city council, and so they
start to learn about democracy in a
meaningful way that way.
Heretofore, except in the last 10
years with the demise of local jour-
nalism, for a variety of reasons, they
don’t get that information. They get a
lot of information about Congress.
They get a lot of information about the
President of the United States, and
some information still at the state-
house, but not nearly as much, and
very little at the local level.
I will say there are heroic people out
there who are still doing great local
journalism, but because of the business
model and because of consolidations,
that has become, I am afraid, very ill.
So just in terms of the definition of
the problem, in 2017, estimated daily
U.S. newspaper circulation—that is
print and digital. So when we focus on,
‘‘Oh, well, print is gone; forget about
it,’’ we realize that the business model
has changed.
But there is a digital model here that
we can see in The Washington Post,
The New York Times, The Boston
Globe, Los Angeles Times, San Fran-
cisco Chronicle. There is still a model.
But their ability to talk about local
news is where we have to get more ef-
fort, I think, in understanding, as citi-
zens.
Circulation, print and digital, in 2017
was 31 million for weekday and 34 mil-
lion for Sunday. That is down 11 and 10
percent, respectively, from each pre-
vious year. The chart next to me shows
the steady decline.
Newspaper consumption—that is dig-
ital and print—has been falling every
year since 1994. Today most Americans
get their news from television and so-
cial media, the primary way they get
their information.
Fifty-five percent of Americans are
regularly tuning into TV to consume
that news information. In contrast,
only 20 percent of Americans regularly
get their news from a physical news-
paper. Only 38 percent of Americans
regularly get their news online.
In 2017, advertising revenue for the
entire newspaper industry was $16.5 bil-
lion, a 10 percent decrease from 2016.
Then there are consolidations, an
issue that I know Mr. CICILLINE will
talk about, the consolidation of the
print newspaper business in particular.
And I will say this for the bay area
where I live and represent, in the bay
area, newspapers, at their peak, had
about 1,500 journalists. This is for
about 7.5, 7.75 million people, in one of
the largest metropolitan areas in the
country that is very diverse, 1,500 jour-
nalists. These aren’t support people.
These are writers, professional journal-
ists. Now there are less than 300 serv-
ing those same 7.5 million people in an
area that is growing and has one of the
most innovative and fastest growing
economies in the world.
It is not just the bay area. Since 2004,
1,800 local papers have been closed or
merged. What traditionally happens—
and there are two large companies that
do this—is they go in and buy the
newspaper and then sell the assets. So
very rarely now—when you go around
to a city or a town where it used to be
a prominent building was the head-
quarters of the local newspaper, those
buildings have been sold.
The San Jose Mercury News had a
prominent building in downtown San
Jose right by city hall. In Los Angeles,
the Los Angeles Times still thrives be-
cause it has local ownership, fortu-
nately; but that L.A. Times building, a
beautiful art deco that was so much a
part of the history of Los Angeles, was
directly across the street from city
hall. There was a reason for that.
The Examiner and the Chronicle in
San Francisco were prominent down-
town. These were icons. Well, a lot of
these consolidations came about, and
they sold these iconic buildings where
people worked. Then, of course, they
sold the print functions because there
was less to do and a lot of the distribu-
tion. But they also laid off and elimi-
nated a lot of the journalists, and that
is where we get our information.
According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 39,210 people worked as re-
porters and editors in the newspaper
industry in 2017. This is down from
44,000, about 15 percent from 2015, and
71,645 in 2004, about a 45 percent nation-
wide decrease. About one-third of the
large U.S. newspapers have suffered
significant layoffs.
Additionally, journalists’ wages re-
mained low. In 2017, the median wage
for an editor was only $49,000, while the
median wage for a reporter was about
$34,000. If you are in a place like the
bay area, Los Angeles, New York, D.C.,
or Boston, you can imagine what the
cost of living does to that kind of in-
come for people whom we rely on to
provide us information.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2981
April 2, 2019
There is hope, however: some news-
paper groups like the one in Philadel-
phia that has coordinated and consoli-
dated with a nonprofit model and is re-
focusing its mission on producing ex-
cellent journalism to inform the public
and focusing on local journalism.
There has been a spike in attendance
in university journalism programs in
spite of the numbers I just told you
since this President took office in 2017.
Through programs to reengage citi-
zens, particularly students, in the im-
portance of journalism and reimag-
ining how we fund print and electronic
newspapers, we can ensure that jour-
nalism remains a bedrock of the coun-
try and a check on its power as it al-
ways has been.
As someone from the bay area who
has had a relationship with our innova-
tion and our tech companies, for
Google and Facebook, they make mil-
lions of dollars off of journalists, and
we think that they should contribute
to that amazing asset that they have
right now, largely free of charge. So we
look to them to partner with us so that
these platforms can be platforms not
just for profit, but platforms for de-
mocracy, where local journalists can
put their wares out there and be able
to benefit from it just as they benefit
from it.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LOFGREN),
who is my wonderful colleague from
San Jose, in the San Francisco Bay
Area.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding. The gen-
tleman has laid out the case quite elo-
quently.
I simply wanted to say that, while
the government could never own or
should never own the news media, we
may have a role to create an environ-
ment where local news can flourish
without our saying in any way how or
what they should cover. But we know
that local news covers local stories,
and without the local news, you will
never find out what is going on in city
hall, what is going on in the board of
supervisors, and what is going on on
the planning commission and the like.
So what Mr. DESAULNIER, Mr.
CICILLINE, and others have outlined
here is a very important challenge for
the United States of America. If we are
going to have control of our govern-
ments, we need to have information;
and if we are going to have informa-
tion, then we need to have a free press
all the way from city hall up to the
White House. We have got some holes
in that coverage right now.
So, Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr.
DESAULNIER, Mr. CICILLINE, and others
for the efforts that they are making,
and I look forward to supporting them
as they move forward.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield to the gentleman from Rhode Is-
land (Mr. CICILLINE).
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by
thanking Congressman DESAULNIER
not only for organizing this important
Special Order hour and saving local
news, but for his enthusiastic and real-
ly passionate leadership on this issue.
I think the graphs that my friend
from California presented tonight are
an illustration of how grave the prob-
lem is and how essential it is that we
develop a solution to help preserve our
local newspapers, because I think we
all recognize that our democracy is
strongest when we have a free and di-
verse press that informs citizens, holds
concentrated power accountable, and
roots out corruption.
There are examples all across the
country of local newspapers doing he-
roic investigative work uncovering cor-
ruption, holding power to account, and
sharing important information with
folks at the local level.
As Justice Brandeis wrote in 1927,
those who won our independence be-
lieved that public discussion is a polit-
ical duty, that the greatest threat to
freedom is an uninformed citizenry,
and that the freedom of thought and
speech are indispensable to the dis-
covery and spread of political truth.
But today, as you have so eloquently
argued, these bedrock constitutional
values are facing existential threats by
the new gatekeepers of information,
the dominant platforms.
Last year, Facebook and Google
amassed more than $60 billion from on-
line advertising, the majority of all on-
line ad revenue. Despite record levels
of online readership, news publishers
have seen a steep decline in revenue
during the rise of these technology gi-
ants.
This bottleneck is bleeding pub-
lishers dry.
In an editorial published last year,
my local newspaper, The Providence
Journal explained that: ‘‘Google and
Facebook now harvest the majority of
the advertising that is supposed to sus-
tain that journalism. It’s essentially
parasitism: newspapers and other jour-
nalistic enterprises do all the work,
while Silicon Valley sucks out the
profits.’’
In the absence of a competitive mar-
ketplace, newsrooms across the coun-
try are laying off reporters and edi-
torial staff or folding altogether. This
is happening to legacy news companies
and digital publishers alike.
There is no question that we have
reached a tipping point.
If this trend continues, we risk per-
manently compromising the news orga-
nizations that are essential to uncover-
ing corruption, holding the government
and powerful corporations accountable,
and sustaining our democracy.
That is why Mr. DESAULNIER and I
have introduced the Journalism Com-
petition and Preservation Act, a bill
that would strengthen journalism by
allowing news publishers to collec-
tively negotiate with dominant plat-
forms to improve the quality, accu-
racy, attribution, and interoperability
of news online.
It is critical that news publishers,
both large and small, have a seat at the
table and equal bargaining power when
negotiating with dominant platforms.
Whether it is an online publisher or
your local newspaper, we cannot have a
democracy without a free and diverse
press. Our country will not survive if
we do not have shared facts, if corrup-
tion is not exposed and rooted out at
all levels of government, and if power
is not held to account. It is simply not
possible.
So, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for his support and cosponsor-
ship of the legislation, his passionate
advocacy for moving forward with it
and for organizing tonight’s Special
Order hour to bring attention to this
really critical issue which is really at
the center of preserving our access to
quality, reliable, and trustworthy news
information which is essential to the
survival of our democracy.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Mr. CICILLINE for the nice com-
ments.
This bill is extremely important, and
I am proud to follow the gentleman’s
leadership in getting it passed and get-
ting it signed.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from the great State of Colo-
rado (Ms. DEGETTE).
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to thank Mr. DESAULNIER for
yielding to me. I also want to thank
him and my colleague, Mr. CICILLINE,
for sponsoring this important piece of
legislation.
This really is a very concerning trend
that is taking place in our society as
more and more local news organiza-
tions in our communities are shutting
down or becoming nonexistent. Main-
taining a truly free and independent
press is vital to our democracy.
I guess he is our favorite Founder to-
night, Thomas Jefferson, also said:
‘‘Were it left to me to decide whether
we should have a government without
newspapers or newspapers without a
government, I should not hesitate a
moment to prefer the latter.’’
b 1800
We, as a society, rely on members of
the press to be our watchdogs, to sound
the alarms and hold our government
leaders accountable when necessary.
According to a study from the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, over the last
15 years, the newspaper industry has
seen over 1,800 mergers or closures of
print newspapers.
That is a staggering 20 percent of all
newspapers in the country that have
now closed since 2004.
In my home State of Colorado, we
have three counties—Costilla, Baca,
and Cheyenne—that have no daily or
weekly papers at all.
And, in my hometown of Denver,
where we have seen explosive popu-
lation growth, we now only have one
daily newspaper, The Denver Post. Our
other newspaper, the Rocky Mountain
News, published its last issue in 2009, 2
months shy of what would have been
its 150th anniversary.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2982 April 2, 2019
While it may have outlived the com-
petition and it now serves as our city’s
only remaining daily paper, The Den-
ver Post, too, has faced its share of
hardships in recent years.
In 2013, The Post had over 250 em-
ployees, but today the number is less
than 100. On April 8, 2018, in response to
another round of devastating layoffs at
the paper, The Denver Post’s own edi-
torial board published an op-ed entitled
‘‘As Vultures Circle, The Denver Post
Must Be Saved.’’
In that op-ed, the editorial board
wrote: ‘‘The smart money is that in a
few years The Denver Post will be rot-
ting bones. And a major city in an im-
portant political region will find itself
without a newspaper.’’
These are not my words. These are
The Denver Post’s own employee’s
words. The massive decline in the num-
ber of reporters covering our local
communities is not happening just in
Denver. It is happening all over the
country, and it is threatening to have
real, tangible impacts on our commu-
nities.
Now, we heard Congresswoman LOF-
GREN question how we are going to get
coverage of local government in our
newspapers.
At The Denver Post, one of the lay-
offs they had was their one employee
who covered Congress. So we are not
only now not having coverage on local
governments, but also of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
Nationwide, the number of full-time
reporters covering our State legisla-
tures is down 35 percent from 2003.
And, while the reporters who remain
continue as an invaluable service to
our communities, frankly, they can’t
do it all, and, as a result, certain sto-
ries absolutely go unreported.
A joint study by the University of
Notre Dame and the University of Illi-
nois at Chicago found a connection be-
tween local newspaper closures and in-
creased interest rates on local bonds.
In fact, the study found that the clo-
sure of a local newspaper results in
local taxpayers paying an extra $650,000
in interest per loan.
That is $650,000 in local taxpayer dol-
lars that could otherwise go to schools,
police, firefighters, potholes, or any
other of a host of local needs, all lost
simply because they didn’t have local
newspapers watching out on local gov-
ernment.
We often talk in Congress about the
fox guarding the henhouse, but in too
many small and rural communities
there is no one guarding at all.
At the end of the day, for the sake of
our democracy, we need local news-
papers. We need local reporters. We
need our watchdogs doing what they do
best. We need to find ways to protect
local news outlets and help them
thrive.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr.
DESAULNIER for highlighting this
pressing issue affecting our commu-
nities and for having us here to discuss
this tonight.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
want to thank all my colleagues who
have joined me today. We started an
informal group, actually, after the in-
stance that the congresswoman talked
about in Denver.
The same ownership owns the Bay
Area News Group and the Los Angeles
News Group, and there were similar
layoffs there.
And in the Bay Area, being there, but
also being there seeing the demise of
local news, seeing the Chronicle in San
Francisco, still owned by a local pub-
lisher, but then having the rest of the
newspapers—almost the entirety of
what was the bedrock of local news
outside of San Francisco, for the other
7 million residents in the Bay Area—al-
most 7 million people—they have seen
these large layoffs like Denver has.
I will say that, in my native town of
Lowell, Massachusetts, the same com-
pany owns that newspaper, and a simi-
lar event has happened there.
There is nothing wrong with people
making money, wanting to make a
larger return on their investment; how-
ever, this is, I would argue, a very
unique institution for democracy.
As Jefferson said, ‘‘Our liberty de-
pends on the freedom of the press. . . .’’
As Brandeis said: How people get
their information, these are not things
that you can separate. They are mutu-
ally intertwined.
So, we need the ability to have this,
and particularly for local government.
When I started almost 30 years ago in
the city of Concord, California, with a
population of about 130,000 people,
there was a gentleman named Larry
Spears who had written for years for
the Oakland Tribune and then for our
local newspaper, The Contra Costa
Times, a county of about a million peo-
ple—not a small county.
He was in the front row. There are
still journalists in that front row, but
we need people—and more of them—in
every front row. Mr. Spears knew the
relationships, how people got elected to
city council, who was appointed to the
planning commission. Having him
there made a difference.
It is human nature that, if you don’t
have someone watching, you are going
to have human nature sometimes do
things that it wouldn’t if somebody
who was professionally charged and
trained to be able to explain to the
general public what is happening and
why it is happening was there.
People will talk about the truth and
deep truth, ‘‘truth’’ being the simple
explanation of what actually happened
and ‘‘deep truth’’ being the meaning of
why people took those physical ac-
tions.
This is what journalism is about. It
is both being able to explain why a leg-
islator or a city council member or a
county supervisor did what they did
and why they voted. But, as important
is understanding why they did it. Did
they do it for the reasons that they
said that were part of the agendized
items, or were there other influences
behind their thoughts? And, can we ex-
plain ourselves so that the public can
understand why we took that choice.
And the ability of somebody to be
able to communicate in an objective
way what we say is important to de-
mocracy.
So, I hope that today is the begin-
ning of a discussion. Mr. CICILLINE
talked about his bill that I am proud to
be a coauthor of that we introduced
today. I think it is probably the most
important.
We have many, many newspapers
supporting it. We hope that there will
be, obviously, a wave of support. Edi-
torial boards, we ask for your help.
Any interested citizen can contact my
office. I have a simple name to remem-
ber as far as Googling it.
Let us know how you can help. If you
are at a journalism school, if you are a
journalist and you have ideas, give us
ideas. These are constitutionally dif-
ficult issues.
The Congress shouldn’t be, as Con-
gresswoman DEGETTE said, deciding
how the First Amendment is orches-
trated, I should say, or organized. But
we should be supportive because, if we
are successful, it is because of inde-
pendent journalism out there.
I would say that it is important that
we have people who write, so that peo-
ple who read and cognitively accept
complicated issues will not become
lazy.
We often get told that it is about our
messaging, but messaging is a two-way
street. It requires the person who is
speaking, or writing, to be able to com-
municate in a succinct, profound, em-
pathy-filled way, but it also requires
us, as citizens, to be listening and un-
derstand that sometimes issues are
complicated.
Well, how do you find that out? I
would opine, as Mr. Postman did in
1985, that—and we know more about
this now in terms of neuroscience and
cognitive development and exercise—
the more we read, the more we practice
at our writing skills, the more we prac-
tice at our communication skills in
general, the deeper our knowledge and
the greater our capacity, cognitively,
to understand and problem-solve.
So I would make the hope that this is
the beginning of something that we
will do good bipartisan work on and
will allow for newspapers, as Jefferson
said, to allow for democracy to exist
and to prosper.
And lastly, in Lincoln’s comment
that I started with when he said: If you
let the people know the facts, the coun-
try will be safe—our Speaker has a fa-
vorite quote where she says another
Lincoln quote that says: Public opinion
means everything. No statute, no pub-
lic proclamation, Lincoln said, has any
meaning if the people do not support it
and it has their sentiment.
I would argue this other quote from
Lincoln is equally as important: If the
American people know the facts, the
country will be safe.
We need to provide the professional
journalism to make sure they get those
facts.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
O God, who has been our help in ages
past and our hope for years to come,
keep our lawmakers under the canopy
of Your care. We do not ask You to sep-
arate them from life’s stresses and
strains but to keep them by Your grace
amid sunshine and shadow.
Lord, shelter them in their coming
in, in their going out, and in their
daily work, that they may be Your in-
struments to advance Your Kingdom.
May they call You during turbulent
times, claiming Your promise to de-
liver them. Encompass them with the
everlasting arms of Your love and
grace that never fail.
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning
business is closed.
IMPROVING PROCEDURES FOR THE
CONSIDERATION OF NOMINA-
TIONS IN THE SENATE—MOTION
TO PROCEED—Resumed
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of the motion to
proceed to S. Res. 50, which the clerk
will report.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A resolution (S. Res. 50) improving proce-
dures for the consideration of nominations in
the Senate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the time until 12:30
p.m. will be equally divided between
the two leaders or their designees.
The Senator from Iowa is recognized.
H.R. 268
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
would like to speak for 1 minute.
Senate Democrats yesterday blocked
a bill that provides much needed funds
for Puerto Rico’s nutrition program,
also, aid for the 2018 hurricanes and
wildfires and, thirdly, assistance to
Midwest States in the midst of a flood
crisis. That includes, at least, Iowa,
Nebraska, Missouri, and maybe other
States.
Now, the people who voted against it
say it was because they care about
Puerto Rico. The bill they blocked
takes care of the urgent funding short-
falls there in that Commonwealth.
Playing politics with disaster aid does
a disservice to the people of Puerto
Rico and the people of States like Iowa
who are suffering right now from these
floods.
Why would these Senators want to
come to campaign in Iowa when they
don’t show sympathy for Iowans suf-
fering from the floods with the vote
they cast last night?
I yield the floor.
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
H.R. 268
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
last night the Senate had an oppor-
tunity to pass an important package of
disaster relief funding for communities
all across our country. Unfortunately,
it didn’t happen. Our Democratic col-
leagues voted down the efforts of
Chairman SHELBY and Senator PERDUE
to put together a comprehensive pack-
age, and it remains unfinished busi-
ness.
As recently as 1 month ago, some
congressional Democrats had expressed
a clear commitment to immediate, bi-
partisan action on disaster relief, and
the package considered yesterday rep-
resented a long list of priorities from
actually both sides of the aisle—the
only such list that had the President’s
explicit support.
It would have helped local schools,
hospitals, and transportation infra-
structure get back up and running,
farmers and ranchers recoup losses,
and our Nation’s military restore read-
iness at bases and installations in
harm’s way. It would have been an im-
mediate and significant step forward
for the coastal communities of Florida
and the Carolinas that are still picking
up the pieces after a devastating hurri-
cane season and for the western com-
munities, as well, besieged by wildfires,
for the families in Puerto Rico who
rely on nutrition assistance that is
dwindling, for those in the path of last
month’s tornadoes in Alabama and
Georgia, and for large swathes of the
heartland still grappling with flood-
waters.
So I am disappointed that political
games carried the day yesterday, but I
assure the American people that our
work on this subject is far from fin-
ished.
NOMINATIONS
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, 217 days—217 days—is how long has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2164 April 2, 2019
this body’s confirming him. For 217
days, a 45-year veteran of the railroad
with unquestioned expertise sat and
sat on the Senate calendar. He wasn’t
controversial. He had been voice-voted
out of committee. He was the kind of
nominee on which even the prospect of
having to file cloture should have been
laughable, but my Democratic col-
leagues wouldn’t let him get a vote.
Finally, after about 7 months and
several high-profile railway accidents,
our colleagues across the aisle finally
relented and let this nominee go for-
ward. After all those months of ob-
struction, not a single one of them
ended up recording a vote against him.
No one voted against him. So it was 217
days for an unquestionably qualified
nominee for a seriously important job
whom literally no one really opposed.
Call it a case study in the Senate’s
dysfunction when it comes to President
Trump’s nominees. If anything, the
case study actually is not extreme
enough because at least this person
was eventually confirmed without a
completely pointless cloture vote, fol-
lowed by even more time supposedly
debating a nominee on whom Senators
do not actually disagree.
Perhaps more illustrative might be
the cases of unobjectionable district
court nominees whose nominations
were slow-walked through months of
idle time, only to receive unanimous
support when it finally came for con-
firmation votes.
Last January, four such nominations
came before the Senate. Each was non-
controversial. Each was well-qualified.
Each, nevertheless, required a cloture
vote. Yet after weeks on the calendar,
each passed without drawing a single
‘‘no’’ vote. No one opposed them, and
yet it took a week.
These were four of the historic 128
cloture votes on nominations we had to
hold on nominations in this adminis-
tration’s first 2 years—128. This is com-
prehensive, across-the-board heel-drag-
ging like nobody in this body has ever
seen before. It is more than five
times—five times—as many cloture
votes on nominations as in the com-
parative periods—listen to this—for
Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clin-
ton, Bush, and Obama combined—com-
bined. In other words, it is systematic
obstruction, not targeted, thoughtful
opposition to a few marquee nomina-
tions or rare circumstances but a
grinding, across-the-board effort to
delay and obstruct the people this
President puts up, even if they have
unquestionable qualifications and even
if the job is relatively low-profile.
As I said last week, I am sure every
Presidential election this side of
George Washington has left some Sen-
ators unhappy with the outcome, but
never before, to my knowledge, has the
unhappy group so comprehensively
tried to stop a new President from as-
sembling the very basics of an adminis-
tration—hundreds and hundreds of days
in Senate purgatory for
uncontroversial nominees to mid-level
posts and months of delay for lower
court nominees who go on to receive
unanimous confirmation votes.
This behavior is novel. It is a break
from Senate tradition, and it is some-
thing this body needs to address, not
just for the sake of this President but
for future Presidents of any party, be-
cause at this rate, the Senate is flirt-
ing with a dangerous new norm.
Today it may be Senate Democrats
who are intent on endlessly reliti-
gating the 2016 election and holding up
all of these qualified people, but absent
a change, these tactics seem guaran-
teed to become standard practice for
Senate minorities on both sides. I don’t
think any of us want that future.
We need to stop things from deterio-
rating further. We need to fix this. We
need to let the President assemble his
team and let the American people have
the government they actually voted
for. We need to turn back toward the
Senate’s institutional tradition in this
vital area for the sake of the Nation’s
future.
My Republican colleagues and I
joined with Democrats back in 2013 and
supported the same sort of modest
changes to our nominations process
through the same sort of standing
order. Were we overjoyed that Presi-
dent Obama had just won reelection?
No, but we still thought he deserved to
stand up a government. So a big bipar-
tisan majority—I voted for it—includ-
ing the leaders of both parties agreed
to trim the postcloture time on lower-
level nominees. I was the minority
leader. It was a Democratic President.
I voted for it.
Supreme Court nominees weren’t
touched, nor circuit courts, nor top ex-
ecutive branch posts, but for district
court judges and lower-level executive
jobs, even as Republicans were in the
minority, many of us agreed to test out
an abbreviated process for President
Obama’s nominees.
The process that we agreed to then is
very similar to the resolution the Sen-
ate will vote on later today. As I have
discussed, Senators BLUNT and
LANKFORD have proposed a similar set
of changes to fix the current mess that
would also become permanent going
forward. Their resolution would make
the Senate more functional and more
consistent. The rules that were good
enough for President Obama’s second
term would also apply under President
Trump and every other President into
the future.
I would submit to my colleagues that
a modest reform like this is either a
good idea or it isn’t. The answer can’t
be flip-flop back and forth depending
upon which party occupies the White
House.
So I will conclude this way. I believe
that every one of my colleagues knows
that our present situation is unhealthy
for this body and for any administra-
tion. I believe every Member of this
body knows that the precedent that is
being set is unsustainable.
So, look, I would urge all of our col-
leagues on both sides: Why don’t we do
the right thing for the Senate? Let’s
show the country that partisanship is
not poison to absolutely everything.
Let’s demonstrate that the U.S. Senate
can still take a modest step to improve
its own workings on a strong bipar-
tisan vote and do it through regular
order. We did it in 2013 when the roles
were reversed. We should do it again
this week.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we
have spent a great deal of time in my
time in the Senate talking about im-
migration and the situation along the
southwestern border. My State has
1,200 miles of common border with
Mexico, so obviously this is very per-
sonal to me and my constituents who
live and work along the border.
We have been caught up in a lot of se-
mantics and more than a little politics
in Washington, DC, debating what is a
wall versus a fence, what is a crisis
versus an emergency—just some of the
semantics we have been caught up in—
but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist or
an expert to see there are a lot of prob-
lems occurring at the border today. I
hope, if there is one thing we can all
agree on, it is that there is in fact a
problem that needs to be solved at the
border, whether you want to call it a
crisis like President Obama did or
whether you want to call it an emer-
gency like President Trump.
Last week, the Secretary of Home-
land Security sent a letter to Congress
detailing the record number of appre-
hensions along the southern border.
Secretary Nielsen noted that Border
Patrol was apprehending between 50,000
and 60,000 a month late last year. Last
month, it was 76,000, the highest in a
decade. At the time of her letter, she
said we were on track to interdict
nearly 100,000 during the month of
March—so almost essentially double
from late last year until this coming
month. Unsurprisingly, Customs and
Border Protection personnel are not
equipped to handle these record num-
bers.
Forty percent of the Border Patrol’s
manpower is spent processing migrants
and providing care and transportation.
These are, by and large, asylum seek-
ers from Central America. In fact,
while the Border Patrol, our primary
law enforcement agency providing bor-
der security, should be securing the
border, many of them are processing
unaccompanied children or family
units, handing out diapers and juice
boxes instead of doing the job they are
trained to perform. They have been
taken off the patrol line to do this kind
of work, leaving areas of the border

vulnerable to exploitation by the drug
cartels. One way the cartels use this
huge volume of humanity coming
across the border is to distract the law
enforcement agencies from doing their
job interdicting the drugs that are poi-
soning tens of thousands of Americans.
We know 70,000 Americans died of drug
overdoses last year—about half of
those from opioids, including synthetic
fentanyl and heroin—90 percent of
which comes from Mexico.
The amount of people coming across
now is so overwhelming that the El
Paso Border Patrol Sector has tempo-
rarily shut down its highway check-
points in the interior so agents can
help process these individuals. Most of
our Members may not realize, we not
only have Border Patrol working at the
border but also in the interior at
checkpoints on major highways be-
cause frequently what will happen is
people are smuggled through or drugs
are smuggled through, and they have
to go through checkpoints for a double
check, at which time a lot of drugs and
a lot of illegal immigrants are discov-
ered.
Additionally, detention facilities are
at or over capacity. These are rel-
atively small because they are built to
house single adults for a short period of
time. The record surge of children and
family units combined with the impact
it has had on processing time has put a
serious strain on their resources. As a
result, the Department of Homeland
Security has been forced to release
families and adults from custody.
I was on a radio program last week in
San Antonio, my hometown. It was
said Border Patrol is so overwhelmed,
they are essentially just putting people
on buses and shipping them into the in-
terior of the State and the country, not
even processing them.
I have heard from officials at DHS
and throughout the ranks of the Border
Patrol that in order to keep up with
this pace, they need our help. They
need more personnel so law enforce-
ment agencies can respond to the cri-
sis, secure the border, and keep our
country safe, as well as adequately and
efficiently processing individuals who
illegally cross the border. We also need
additional facilities to house illegal
immigrants in custody so we don’t en-
gage in the failed catch-and-release
policy, which is just another pull fac-
tor to encourage more people to come.
If they know they are not going to be
detained and they are going to be re-
leased, that is an incentive for them to
come and join this wave of humanity
coming across the border. We should be
able to enforce the law and properly
care for migrants in custody, but inad-
equate resources are limiting DHS’s
ability to do both.
Ours is a compassionate country. We
are a nation of immigrants. Every-
body—almost everybody came from
somewhere else at some point in their
family history, but the only way we
are going to be able to maintain that
compassion and generosity, when it
comes to immigration, is by bringing
some order out of chaos.
Many illegal immigrants know we
are compassionate and generous, and
they will take full advantage of the
gaps in our border security and flaws in
our immigration laws. The cartels—the
criminal organizations that get rich
moving people from Central America,
across Mexico, into the United States—
know for sure because they are exploit-
ing those gaps and flaws in our immi-
gration laws. It is not just the sheer
numbers of people crossing the border
that is concerning, it is the makeup of
the people coming across.
We used to see primarily single adult
males arriving from Mexico, and our
current detention facilities reflect
that, but now, because of the gaps and
flaws in our immigration laws that are
being exploited, people coming across
are family units and unaccompanied
children from Central American coun-
tries who almost uniformly claim asy-
lum. That means they have to appear
in front of an immigration judge at
some point to have their claim assessed
and adjudicated.
While there absolutely are legitimate
families coming to our country for le-
gitimate reasons, that is not the case
for all the 36,000 family units appre-
hended last month alone.
Individuals crossing illegally know
about the loopholes in our laws, as I
said, and they know how to exploit
them. For example, in 1997, the Flores
settlement agreement determined that
the Department of Homeland Security
can only detain unaccompanied chil-
dren for 20 days before releasing them
to the Department of Health and
Human Services, which in turn places
them with sponsors—usually family
members in the interior of the United
States. Then they are given a notice to
appear at an immigration hearing at
some point in the future, but because
of the backlog of cases, 98 percent of
them don’t show up. While this was un-
questionably well-intentioned at the
time, it has turned into a pull factor
for illegal immigrants hoping to game
the system, as well as the
transnational criminal organizations
that get rich engaging in this sort of
trade.
In 2016, the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals expanded the Flores agree-
ment, effectively applying the settle-
ment to family units and not just un-
accompanied children. So now, rather
than single adults arriving at the bor-
der alone, they are bringing children
with them so they can pose as a family
unit. They realize they can bring a
child—any child—and pose as a family
unit so they will be released within 20
days.
Sadly, Flores is not the only loophole
being exploited. Another well-inten-
tioned piece of legislation that is being
abused is the Trafficking Victims Pro-
tection Reauthorization Act or
TVPRA. This legislation limits our
ability to return unaccompanied chil-
dren from countries other than Mexico
or Canada to their home country.
These loopholes are an attraction or
pull factor and encourage parents to
send their children on the dangerous
journey to our southern border alone
or sometimes with a single parent or
sometimes with a smuggler or human
trafficker posing as a parent.
This isn’t a symbiotic relationship,
where the smuggler gets an honest
day’s pay and the migrant gets a com-
fortable ride to the United States.
These smugglers are called coyotes for
a reason; they are predators.
Children are being kidnapped to serve
as a free ticket into the United States.
They are often abused or raped along
the way, and many arrive at our border
in terrible health. We simply cannot
allow these practices to continue with
no response by Congress. We need to
close the loopholes that are being used
to unlawfully enter and remain in the
United States and provide much needed
protection for these vulnerable chil-
dren.
If a pipe burst and caused your kitch-
en to flood, you wouldn’t start by
cleaning up the mess; you would start
by fixing the pipe first. If we want to
have any sort of impact on the massive
numbers of people crossing our border,
which will only grow, we have to look
not just at the problem but at the root
cause.
I would urge all of our colleagues on
the other side to stop viewing this
through a purely political lens. This is
not a question of Trump wins, you lose
or Trump loses and you win. I am
afraid that defines a lot of our politics
in Washington today. That is a terrible
mistake and a disservice to the people
we represent, and it is an embarrass-
ment to an institution which is sup-
posed to be the world’s greatest delib-
erative body.
We need to view this together as the
humanitarian crisis it is—President
Obama called it that—and view it as a
problem that will only continue to
grow without our intervention, which
it has. We need to view it as an urgent
issue that requires our cooperation
and, yes, our compromise.
I yield the floor.

cuss.
Today, the Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice,
and Science is holding its annual hear-
ing on the President’s budget request,
with the Department of Commerce,
with representatives from the Depart-
ment.
The representative from the Depart-
ment that is invited, in my experience,
has always been the Secretary—in this
case, Wilbur Ross. This year, for as
long as I can remember, with no public
explanation, Secretary Ross declined
the Subcommittee’s invitation.
The Department of Commerce has a
budget request for over $12.2 billion but
couldn’t send over its Secretary to de-
fend it. It is extraordinary that the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2166 April 2, 2019
Secretary provided no justification to
the Republican chairman of the com-
mittee for his actions. It is extraor-
dinary to me that this Secretary be-
lieves he should be treated differently
from other Secretaries. He believes he
may not be held accountable before the
American people.
Secretary Ross’s absence is espe-
cially concerning to me, given the last
time he appeared before the sub-
committee. He blatantly, objectively,
irrefutably misled me about a critical
issue facing the Commerce Depart-
ment. Perhaps he knew he would be
asked about what he said last time and
would be asked to tell us what is the
truth.
A year ago, I asked Secretary Ross
why he had marketed the proposed ad-
dition of a controversial citizenship
question to the census as being nec-
essary to enforce the Voting Rights
Act. To claim that question was needed
to enforce the law when the adminis-
tration had no interest in enforcing it
was actually laughable at the time. So
I asked Secretary Ross why he had
such a sudden interest in adding the
question when the Department of Jus-
tice had not brought a single suit
under section 2 of the Voting Rights
Act.
This was his response, and, remem-
ber, it is a crime to lie in your testi-
mony before the Congress. He claimed
the Justice Department is the one that
made the request of the Commerce De-
partment. He made similar claims be-
fore the House. He testified that Com-
merce was responding solely to the De-
partment of Justice’s request, and the
Department of Justice made the re-
quest for the inclusion of the citizen-
ship question.
Those are the claims Secretary Ross
made, and all of those claims are false.
This was proven as a result of emails
obtained through a FOIA lawsuit. It
was not something he was willing to
bring forth, but they had to have a law-
suit to get the truth. We now know,
Secretary Ross himself made the ini-
tial request to include the citizenship
question. We know it was Secretary
Ross who pressured the reluctant Jus-
tice Department to claim that such a
question would be helpful to enforce
the Voting Rights Act.
And now we know that the inclusion
of this question, as many of us sus-
pected from the beginning, was a na-
kedly political act, one that involves
none other than Kris Kobach and Steve
Bannon. The proof of all of this is in
the emails. Just 1 year before I asked
Secretary Ross about this issue, he
wrote that he was ‘‘mystified why
nothing had been done in response to
my months old request that we include
the citizenship question.’’
Well, I am mystified how Secretary
Ross’s testimony can be construed as
anything other than blatantly mis-
leading Congress. His testimony earned
him four Pinocchios from the Wash-
ington Post.
Two courts have now declared that
Secretary Ross’s attempt to include
the citizenship question was illegal.
One of them found that ‘‘in a startling
number of ways, Secretary Ross’s ex-
planations for his decision were unsup-
ported by, or even counter to, the evi-
dence before the agency.’’ That is a re-
markable, but not surprising, declara-
tion from the court.
So today I have a simple message for
Secretary Ross: You are not an invest-
ment banker anymore. You serve the
American people, and part of your job
is being accountable to Congress and to
the public. Trying to run from Con-
gress will not solve your problems, and
trying to hide from the truth will not
either. The truth has a way of catching
up with you. If you don’t tell the truth,
it eventually becomes obvious. Sec-
retary Ross did not tell the truth.
S. RES. 50
Madam President, to say it is dis-
appointing that the Senate is going to
vote today in relation to the resolution
to reduce postcloture debate on nomi-
nations is an understatement. This is
actually a resolution in search of a
problem. This is an erosion of the Sen-
ate’s responsibility—in fact, our sworn
constitutional duty—to advise and con-
sent to the President’s—any Presi-
dent’s—nominations. It is a removal of
one of the last guardrails for quality
and bipartisanship in our nomination
process. It is short sided. It is a par-
tisan power grab, and it is motivated
by the far right’s desire to flood the
Federal judiciary with young, ideolog-
ical nominees, many of whom, as we
have seen time and again in the Judici-
ary Committee, are simply unqualified
to serve on our Nation’s courts. We
have seen nominees who have never
been in a courtroom, and they are
being nominated for lifetime judge-
ships.
Postcloture time is a critical tool for
Senators, especially those who do not
sit on the Judiciary Committee, to vet
nominees for lifetime judgeships. In
fact, last Congress, more than one
nominee had to withdraw after scru-
tiny during this time led the Repub-
licans withdrawing their support. We
actually took the time to ask ques-
tions—an extra 20 minutes of ques-
tions, or an extra hour of questions.
For somebody who is up for a lifetime
appointment, I think that is what the
American public pay us to do.
Unfortunately, for the Republican
leadership the nominations process in
the Senate is about quantity not qual-
ity. Let me give you an example. In the
past 2 years, Republicans have dis-
regarded the important role of the
ABA. They denied them the time they
needed to evaluate judicial nominees,
or when they have evaluated them and
they have come back saying they are
unqualified, they have ignored that.
Republicans routinely stacked hear-
ing panels with multiple circuit court
nominees over Democrats’ objections—
something Democrats never did to Re-
publicans. Republicans have even held
several hearings over recess despite our
objections. That is certainly something
I would never do when I was chairman
if any Republican asked me not to.
Upon the White House’s changing
hands from a Democrat to a Repub-
lican, the Republicans abruptly
changed the policy of the blue slips.
There has been a long-held tradition of
honoring blue slips from home State
Senators on circuit court nominees.
When I was chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, I respected the input of all
home State Senators, no matter
whether we had a Democrat or Repub-
lican in the White House and no matter
whether the Senator was a Republican
or a Democrat. Republicans only seem
to insist on honoring blue slips when a
Democrat is in the White House.
When I was chairman with a Demo-
cratic President, every single Repub-
lican wrote a letter saying the blue slip
was so sacred, and every single one of
them wanted it to be upheld. It had to
be upheld. Whoops, a Republican comes
into the White House, and we don’t
need it any more. Look no further than
the Judiciary Committee’s markup
this week, where they ignored the op-
position of two home State Senators
who are also members of the com-
mittee, including the Ranking Mem-
ber, and will advance two circuit nomi-
nees for whom blue slips were not re-
turned.
When Democrats were in charge, no
Republican would condone that and no
Democrat would make them have to
face that. Yet they have turned it into
a partisan rubberstamp. We are not
being the conscience of the Nation.
Opponents to this resolution can say
it is necessary to do this because of the
slow pace with which President
Trump’s judicial nominations are being
confirmed. Let’s quickly review that.
In his first 2 years, President Trump
had more judicial nominations con-
firmed than President Obama did in his
first 4 years. In just 2 years, we almost
doubled the number of circuit court
nominations confirmed compared to
President Obama’s first 4 years. In
fact, President Trump had more circuit
nominees confirmed in his first 2 years
than President Obama, President
George W. Bush, President Clinton, or
President George H. W. Bush.
So I don’t need lectures from Sen-
ators in this Chamber about the impor-
tance of judicial nominations or the
methods by which Members could frus-
trate the confirmation process. I lived
it. I have seen it. I have served here
longer than any other Member of this
body.
Regardless of whether it was a Re-
publican President or a Democratic
one, I respected the role of home State
Senators, the role of the Senate as a
whole, and our roles as individual Sen-
ators to evaluate the nomination be-
fore us.
In 2013, in a bipartisan vote, the Sen-
ate agreed to a resolution to reduce
postcloture debate that was supposed
to be good for the life of the 113th Con-
gress, not the permanent rule change
proposed by S. Res. 50. Let’s remember

the facts, not just some of them. All
the other guardrails of the nomination
process were intact at the time. Nomi-
nations were thoroughly vetted by
both the administration and the com-
mittees here in the Senate. Nominees
were still subject to a 60-vote threshold
for judicial nomination, including cir-
cuit nominees. Cloture was never filed
on a day in which a nomination was re-
ported on the floor. For judicial nomi-
nations, hearings were not continually
stacked with multiple circuit court
nominees, something both Republicans
and Democrats agreed on. The preroga-
tive of home State Senators and their
in-State judicial selection commit-
tees—most of which are bipartisan—
were respected both before and after
the resolution.
I understand the Republican major-
ity now wants to cry foul and accuse
Democrats of needlessly holding up our
confirmation process. I wish people had
been here more than 2 years. I look
back at the glacial pace with which Re-
publicans allowed us to process judicial
nominations for the first 6 years of the
Obama administration.
From the very beginning, in 2009, Re-
publicans inexplicably withheld their
consent to consider President Obama’s
very first circuit nominee and one that
was supported by his Republican home
State Senator, the highly respected
Richard Lugar.
I always look back at the shameful
treatment of Merrick Garland to fill a
critical vacancy on the Supreme Court.
Never in the history of this country
have we refused to allow a Supreme
Court nominee to at least have a hear-
ing and a vote until Merrick Garland.
That was a political power grab that
undermined the legitimacy of the Sen-
ate and the courts. This claim was
made: We don’t vote on Supreme Court
nominees in an election year.
Well, of course we do. I remember al-
most all of us Republicans and Demo-
crats voting on a nominee that Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan made in an elec-
tion year when he was going to be leav-
ing the Presidency. Looking back
might provide a glimpse of history, but
it will do little to restore the comity
that was a hallmark of the Senate
when I first came here—a hallmark
which made the Senate seem like the
conscience of the Nation, not a par-
tisan political stamp.
Looking forward, this resolution will
do little to restore the comity and will
further polarize the Senate, which is
supposed to be the world’s greatest de-
liberative body. It will only further
contribute to the politicization of our
courts. The Federal courts are per-
ceived throughout the world as above
politics and are now being seen, more
and more, as a political rubberstamp
for President Trump.
When the Senate Rules Committee
held a hearing to evaluate the proposal
back in 2017, I remarked that the word
‘‘obstruction’’ had become a term
thrown about in the Senate whenever
unanimous consent was not provided.
‘‘Duty,’’ unfortunately, is a word we
hear too little in this body.
Vermonters, time and again, give me
their trust not only to represent
Vermont values here in Washington
but to protect the centuries-old insti-
tutions that have sustained our democ-
racy and that made us the longest ex-
isting democracy currently in the
world. The Senate is part of why that
democracy still exists. The Senate
should reject this resolution. We can-
not abandon the traditions that made
the Senate, at its very best, the con-
science of the Nation in exchange for
short-term political gain and going
from the conscience of the Nation to a
partisan rubberstamp. That is not the
Senate that I admire. It is not the Sen-
ate that has been led by some of the
best Republicans and Democrats I have
known over my decades here. It is not
the Senate we want to see in the his-
tory books.
I yield the floor.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SCOTT of Florida). The Democratic
leader is recognized.
H.R. 268
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the
Senate failed to pass emergency relief
funding yesterday to help the Amer-
ican families recovering from natural
disasters. It failed for one reason—the
Republicans removed critical aid for
Puerto Rico and other territories from
the House bill after President Trump
told them to do it. Under this adminis-
tration and with Leader MCCONNELL’s
blessing, even disaster relief has now
become political.
I don’t need to litigate why we are
here. Over the last 2 years, the Amer-
ican people have endured staggering
natural disasters that have devastated
communities across the country. These
Americans need help. They need help
now. I would parenthetically add, if
there were ever evidence of global
warming or of climate change, this
would be it despite the fact that just
about every Republican has his head or
her head in the sand and will not admit
it.
Regardless of what you think the
causes were, Americans have always
stood together when American citizens
have been hit by disaster. We band to-
gether and say we are going to help one
another—all American citizens, all.
Yet one part of America is not being
treated like the others, and why not? It
is because President Trump, for rea-
sons that defy decency, harbors an ap-
parent contempt for the people of Puer-
to Rico. He tweeted again last night
and erroneously claimed that $91 bil-
lion has been afforded the people of
Puerto Rico. He ridiculed the leader-
ship that has desperately tried to re-
build the island in the wake of these
megastorms.
Let’s get the facts straight.
The Republicans know the storms
that hit Puerto Rico over a year ago
were not ordinary storms; they know
these were historic catastrophes. We
are talking about the deadliest disas-
ters to hit American soil in over a cen-
tury. We are talking about the worst
power outage in American history. We
are talking about 3,000 lives lost. Yet
here we are, 18 months later, and the
island hasn’t recovered.
It is surreal that a disaster so awful
has been met with a Presidential re-
sponse that is so tepid and so heartless.
It is surreal that our Republican col-
leagues go along with this and say we
are not going to help Puerto Rico in
the way that is needed. Billions in
funding for recovery and mitigation ef-
forts right now remain locked in the
Treasury. Congress already appro-
priated $20 billion that the administra-
tion has not allocated. All we want to
do is make sure the money is allocated.
That is one of the things we want to
do.
Are our Republican colleagues op-
posed to that? That is what it sounds
like. Some of them say it is political.
What is political is President Trump’s
saying no aid for Puerto Rico and hav-
ing the Republicans jump in line, even
those with many Puerto Ricans in
their States. Make no mistake, we
have reached this impasse because the
President has said himself he opposes
help for Puerto Rico, and the Repub-
licans follow along.
Some of my colleagues from the
other side came up with another shib-
boleth; that we opposed the House bill
because it didn’t provide funding for
the Midwest. First of all, the House bill
was aimed at disasters in 2018, not in
2019. Second, Senator LEAHY offered an
amendment that would have added
funding for the Middle West and fund-
ing for Puerto Rico. What did the Re-
publicans do? They blocked it anyway.
So this undoes their fantasy that the
Democrats are opposed to aid for the
Middle West. Senator LEAHY and I will
be offering an amendment that will
give aid to the Midwest and to Puerto
Rico. Let’s see where our Republican
colleagues stand. Will they block that
too?
Yesterday’s vote boiled down to a
simple question: Do the Republicans
believe the people of Puerto Rico de-
serve relief for their natural disasters
as do all Americans? Do they believe
the families of Puerto Rico—whatever
you think of this elected official in
Puerto Rico—deserve to be helped just
like the families of the Midwest and
California?
Do they believe the statement of the
Governor of Puerto Rico, Rossello, that
the House bill is much preferable to
Puerto Rico than what the Senate has
proposed or do they make their own
judgment based on what President
Trump said and then call it political?
What a shame.
Let me be clear as day: Without ob-
jection, the Democrats support funding
for all regions of the United States
that have been affected by natural dis-
asters, which is any State or territory
that needs to rebuild. That list should
include the Middle West, and it should

include Puerto Rico because our fellow
citizens on that island have yet to re-
cover from the deadliest of storms in
our recent history.
I will let this Chamber know that
Senator LEAHY and I will be offering a
new amendment to the disaster bill in
order to provide billions of new addi-
tional dollars for the Midwest’s 2019
disasters.
The Senate Republicans say they
care about Iowa and Nebraska, but
they didn’t put an additional penny in
for that aid. They said to let them
compete with the 2018 disasters and the
same amount of money. We are going a
step further. We are going to say we
need additional aid for the Middle
West—for Iowa and Nebraska—as well
as aid for Puerto Rico. It is not an ei-
ther-or.
If we get into an either-or, the next
time, it will be your State, my Repub-
lican colleagues, when people will not
want to vote for aid or it will be for
mine or another’s. I experienced it, in-
cidentally, with Sandy, when a lot of
Republicans didn’t want to vote for aid
after Sandy because it was for New
York. That was so wrong.
So I say to all who are suggesting
that the Democrats aren’t willing to
help the people of Iowa and Nebraska
and other States that we are calling
their bluff.
Are you ready to actually appro-
priate new money—more money—for
what the people in the Midwest who
are struggling need? The Democrats
are. Let’s see where you stand.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. President, on healthcare, the Re-
publicans have failed to advance any of
their healthcare plans through Con-
gress, so they are trying to repeal
healthcare through the courts. This
reeks of desperation, for they do not
have a backup plan.
Last night, the President tweeted
that the Republicans will come up with
their plan in 2021. Translation: The Re-
publicans have no healthcare plan.
Translation: President Trump has no
healthcare plan. It is the same old song
the Republicans and the President have
been singing. They are for repeal, but
they have no replacement. President
Trump confirmed he will hold Ameri-
cans hostage through the 2020 election
when it comes to healthcare. He prom-
ises with ‘‘re-elect me, and maybe you
can take a peek at my backup plan
after that,’’ which he doesn’t have.
What a ruse. What a shame. What a
disgrace.
People are suffering. When their chil-
dren have cancer, people need protec-
tion so the insurance companies will
not pull away the healthcare. Seniors
need protection from the rising costs of
prescription drugs. Women need pro-
tection so they will not be treated dif-
ferently than men when they have
healthcare needs that are particular to
women. Young people need protection
to be allowed to continue to stay on
their parents’ plans until they are 26 if
they start new lives after high school
or college. All of these folks need pro-
tection.
President Trump and our Republican
friends say: Rip all of those things
away, and trust us. Maybe in 2021, we
will have a plan.
With a stubbornness that would im-
press a mule, President Trump has
waged a manic war on the American
healthcare system that shows no sign
of stopping. Now we are asked to be-
lieve that President Trump has a won-
derful but secret healthcare plan but
will, for some reason, not reveal it
until the next election. What a trans-
parent ruse.
Snake oil salesmen, take notes.
Here is why we can’t believe the
President’s punt and promise.
In May 2017, after the Republicans
voted to repeal the healthcare law, on
national television, the President cele-
brated in the Rose Garden with House
Republicans. He celebrated the passage
of a bill that would result in 23 million
fewer people having health insurance
and would result in gutting the protec-
tions for Americans who have pre-
existing conditions. He celebrated his
own broken promise to never cut Med-
icaid and to always protect people with
preexisting conditions, and he did it on
national TV. So don’t tell me this time
will be different. Don’t tell me there is
a secret plan, when we know what the
Republicans’ healthcare plan will be—
increased premiums, a loss of coverage,
and the elimination of protection for
preexisting conditions. The markets
will be stabilized, but families will be
tossed into an abyss of inferior care.
President Trump’s lawsuit seeks to
wholly undo the progress we have
made, but he wants the American peo-
ple to just wait for a magic plan to ap-
pear 2 years from now?
If successful, the President’s lawsuit
will mean skyrocketing costs for fami-
lies. The President wants the American
people to just wait and see.
President Trump’s lawsuit will mean
massive increases in prescription drug
spending for seniors who are on Medi-
care. The President wants the Amer-
ican people to just wait and see.
President Trump’s lawsuit will mean
women will be charged more because
they are women. The President wants
the American people to just wait and
see.
So, when President Trump insists he
has a silver bullet plan that we will
only be able to see if the American peo-
ple reelect him, we know what a sham
that is. For a President who has per-
petrated lots of shams, this one takes
the cake.
I am asking: Which one of our Repub-
lican colleagues will stand up for
healthcare for the American people?
Senator SHAHEEN has a resolution
that simply reads to the Justice De-
partment: Withdraw your suit that
would do all of these awful things.
How many of our Republican col-
leagues will go on that proposal? Let’s
see. Are they going to say it is politics
too? With regard to the healthcare of
millions of Americans, any time the
President does something horrible and
the Democrats resist, are they going to
say it is politics? Oh, no. That is what
we are supposed to do whether it comes
to Puerto Rico or whether it comes to
healthcare.
CHINA
Mr. President, I have one final word
on China.
The New York Times reported yester-
day that a trade agreement with the
United States and China is nearly 90
percent complete, with a deal being po-
tentially finalized later this month.
Yet it alarms me that the President,
for all his bluster, will likely settle on
a deal that will be devoid of any mean-
ingful reform to China’s economy and
trade practices. Instead, he will settle
for the purchases of American goods by
the Chinese state. This move will only
strengthen China’s leverage while it
will do little to help us long term.
We want to protect our farmers, but
we don’t want a soybean sellout where,
in exchange for soybeans, we trade
away America’s family jewels—our in-
tellectual property, our industrial
know-how, our hard-working labor
force being able to compete in a recip-
rocal way in China the way China can
compete here. If it is just the purchases
of product, the Chinese Government
can always turn off the tap. So we are
entering treacherous territory.
I have a simple message for President
Trump and praise him for standing up
to China more than President Bush or
President Obama did on this issue. I
say to him: We have made progress in
making China see it has abusive prac-
tices. Stand firm. Don’t back out. I
cannot think of a worse end for us than
to say ‘‘uncle’’ at the last minute. Skip
the political photo op and make good
on your promise to stand up for Amer-
ican business and workers when China
takes advantage.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call
be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.
S. RES. 50
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, some-
times attempting to block a Presi-
dential nominee is justified. If a Presi-
dent nominates a candidate who clear-
ly is unfit for the office for which he or
she has been nominated, then, as Sen-
ators, we should try to stop the con-
firmation of that nominee. But that is
the exception. The Senate’s advice and
consent power is not supposed to be
used to slow-walk all of a President’s
nominees simply because one party
doesn’t like the President who is doing
the nominating.
In the past, once Presidential nomi-
nees had been vetted and approved by
the appropriate committee, their con-
firmation was pretty painless. Cloture

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2169
April 2, 2019
votes designed to end filibusters of can-
didates and allow their nominations to
come to a vote were rare because Sen-
ators only tried to block nominees in
extreme cases. But that is no longer
the case. Since President Trump took
office, Democrats in the Senate have
engaged in a systematic campaign of
obstruction, pointlessly delaying quali-
fied nominees for no reason other than
the fact that Democrats dislike this
President.
But wait, you say. Not so fast. Maybe
Democrats obstructed all of these
nominees because they didn’t believe
any of them were qualified for the posi-
tions for which they had been nomi-
nated—except we all know that is not
the case because again and again
Democrats have delayed and ob-
structed nominees they have ulti-
mately supported.
One egregious example occurred in
January of 2018, when Democrats
forced the Senate to spend more than
an entire week considering four dis-
trict court judges even though not one
single Democrat voted against their
confirmation. That is right—Demo-
crats forced the Senate to spend more
than a week of our floor time consid-
ering the nomination of four judges
even though not one single Democrat
opposed their confirmation. These
judges could have been confirmed in a
matter of minutes by voice vote, but
Democrats forced the Senate to spend
more than a week on their consider-
ation—time that could have been spent
on genuinely controversial nominees or
on some of the many important issues
facing our country.
Another ugly example occurred dur-
ing my chairmanship of the Commerce
Committee last Congress, when Demo-
crats pointlessly delayed the confirma-
tion of the Under Secretary of Trans-
portation for Policy, Derek Kan. Mr.
Kan, who had been confirmed by voice
vote just 2 years earlier as a member of
the Amtrak board of directors, was de-
layed for months in 2017, with Demo-
crats ultimately requiring the filing of
cloture—but not because Democrats
had any problem with his qualifica-
tions. When the vote on his nomination
finally came, he was confirmed by an
overwhelming margin of 90 to 7. Once
again, Democrats obstructed for ob-
struction’s sake.
During President Obama’s first 2
years in office, his nominees were sub-
jected to a total of 12 cloture votes. Do
you want to know how many cloture
votes President Trump’s nominees
faced during the President’s first 2
years in office? One hundred and twen-
ty-eight—more than 10 times as many
cloture votes as President Obama’s
nominees faced over the same period—
128 to 12.
Democrats’ slow-walking of nominees
is obviously a problem for this Presi-
dent and his administration. Essential
positions have stayed vacant for
months longer than they should have,
making it more challenging for the ad-
ministration to carry out its respon-
sibilities. But Democrats’ actions are
not just a problem for this administra-
tion; they are setting a terrible prece-
dent that could derail the work of the
Senate and inhibit the President’s abil-
ity to govern for many years into the
future. Just imagine if Democrats’ be-
havior over the past 2 years becomes
the norm. Presidents could be waiting
years to adequately staff their admin-
istrations, and the Senate would be
perpetually tied up on unnecessary clo-
ture votes, leaving less and less time to
actually do the business of governing.
Democrats and Republicans need to
curb this rampant obstruction before it
becomes a permanent precedent here in
the Senate. Later today, we will have a
chance to do so when we vote on the
Blunt-Lankford resolution.
Back at the beginning of President
Obama’s second term, Democrats and a
number of Republicans, including me,
passed a measure streamlining the con-
firmation process for lower level posi-
tions, such as district court judges and
Assistant Secretaries. This was obvi-
ously something that benefited Presi-
dent Obama and only President Obama
since the rules change expired at the
end of that Congress, but Republicans
signed on because we believe that
Presidents should be able to staff their
administrations in a timely fashion. So
we worked with Democrats to stream-
line consideration of lower level ad-
ministration nominees.
The Blunt-Lankford resolution is
very similar to the rules change we
passed in 2013. Like the 113th Congress
rules change, the Blunt-Lankford reso-
lution would streamline the process for
consideration of lower level nominees,
while preserving the current rules for
high-level nominee positions, such as
Cabinet officials and Justices.
Thirty-four currently serving Demo-
cratic Senators also served in the 113th
Congress and voted for that rules
change, and I am hearing that Demo-
crats would be willing to support the
Blunt-Lankford resolution as well. But
there is one catch: Democrats appar-
ently would only support the rules
change if we delay the effective date of
the resolution to 2021—in the hopes
that they will have a Democrat in the
White House by then.
That is an outrageous demand, this
‘‘We will take the rules change when it
helps us, but we will do everything we
can to make sure the other party
doesn’t get its share of the benefits,
but that ‘‘The rules don’t apply to us’’
attitude has unfortunately become
pretty typical of the Democratic Party
lately. Think about recent Democratic
support for packing the Supreme
Court. Why has that long-dead idea
come back to haunt us? Because Demo-
crats are angry that President Trump
has gotten two individuals confirmed
to the Supreme Court. Apparently, the
only good Supreme Court Justices are
the Justices nominated by Democrats.
Take the Democratic proposal to abol-
ish the electoral college. Democrats
are still mad about their loss in the
2016 Presidential election. We get that.
Their solution is not working harder to
win in 2020 but changing the rules to
favor their party.
Simple intellectual honesty would
dictate that the 34 current Democratic
Senators who voted for the rules
change in the 113th Congress vote for
the rules change today. I hope they
will. Nothing less than the future of
the Senate is at stake here.
Democrats have a choice to make:
They can vote to restore the Senate’s
tradition of efficiently confirming non-
controversial nominees so the work of
the government can get done, or they
can continue to pursue a damaging,
virulent partisanship that will nega-
tivity affect the Senate’s ability to
function for decades to come.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over
the past 2 years, some in this body
have decided that they will oppose any
nominee suggested by President
Trump. There isn’t a Senator who
serves their State’s interest when
qualified, noncontroversial nominees
are prevented from being confirmed;
however, some Members continue to do
just that by slow-walking the Presi-
dent’s nominees for partisan purposes.
This concern about the speed of con-
firming nominees is not anything new.
For the benefit of those who were not
here at the time, I would like to take
this opportunity to review some of the
history on this subject and how we got
where we are today with all this stall-
ing.
Since the rejection of the Robert
Bork nomination for the Supreme
Court in 1987, Republicans have felt
like we are living under two sets of
rules. Republican Supreme Court nomi-
nees could be rejected by Democrats on
ideological grounds if they didn’t pass
their litmus test, but Republicans con-
tinued to vote to confirm otherwise
qualified Democrat nominees who had
what we might consider very radical
views about interpreting the Constitu-
tion to mean things that the Constitu-
tion plainly does not say.
Then all of a sudden in 2003, to con-
trast with what the practice had been
from 1789, Democrats entered the Sen-
ate as a minority party under a Repub-
lican President. Prior to 2003, there
was simply no history of systemati-
cally opposing cloture to prevent judi-
cial nominees from ever getting a final
vote.
However, coaxed on by leftwing ac-
tivists, Senate Democrats embarked in
2003 on an unprecedented campaign of
obstruction by filibustering several of
President Bush’s judicial nominees to
keep them from being confirmed.
When Senate Democrats began to use
the cloture rule to block George W.
Bush’s circuit court nominees, we
made it very clear that we Republicans
were done living by two sets of rules.
We warned Democrats that, if they
continued down that path, we would

follow their precedent when the tables
were turned, but the Democrat ob-
struction continued anyway.
Not long after—and as they often so
do in this Chamber—the tables were
turned. President Obama entered office
with a Democrat majority in the Sen-
ate. True to Republican promises to
not live by two sets of rules, we began
to follow the precedent established by
the Democrats and blocked a propor-
tional number of President Obama’s ju-
dicial nominees.
Despite the fact that Republicans
were holding Democrats to the same
standard that the Democrats estab-
lished, Senate Democrats made a big
show of being outraged at that time
and being indignant about this equal
treatment. Senate Democrats began
threatening to invoke the nuclear op-
tion to ram through President Obama’s
nominees on a simple majority vote.
However, the minority and majority
parties reached an agreement—yes, we
actually reached an agreement—and
this was at the beginning of the 113th
Congress where Senate Republicans
agreed to institute a temporary stand-
ing order to limit postcloture debate
for sub-Cabinet and U.S. district court
nominees. This agreement was made
explicitly as a bipartisan compromise,
and that bipartisan compromise was
there to avert the use of what we call
a nuclear option. Then-Majority Lead-
er Harry Reid stated on January 24,
2013:
I know that there is a strong interest in
rules changes among many of my caucus. In
fact, I would support many of these changes
through regular order. But I agree that the
proper way to change Senate rules is
through the procedures established in those
rules, and I will oppose any effort in this
Congress or the next to change the Senate
rules other than through regular order.
That is the end of Senator Reid’s,
who was then majority leader, quote.
Despite this statement by Senator
Reid and despite the bipartisan agree-
ment, the Democrat leader decided to
pursue the nuclear option just a few
months later. At the same time, Sen-
ate Democrats thought that Secretary
Clinton would be President and that
forcing this rules change would benefit
their agenda for the foreseeable future.
Our side saw this for what it really
was, a power grab that sought to
steamroll the minority party. At that
time, the minority party was my
party.
Before Senator Reid invoked the nu-
clear option, we actually urged the
Democrats to take a longer view. We
were trying to get them to think in
terms of what can happen in the future
if you do something now. So we again
warned that we were not about to play
by two sets of rules and that they, the
Democrats, would regret their decision
when the tables were turned.
I was on the Senate floor on the day
that Majority Leader Reid broke the
rules to change the rules—let me em-
phasize it—broke the Senate rules to
change the rules and made the fol-
lowing comment. This is this Senator
speaking in 2013:
If there is one thing that will always be
true, it is this: Majorities are fickle. Majori-
ties are fleeting. Here today; gone tomorrow.
So the majority has chosen to take us down
this path. The silver lining is that there will
come a day when the roles are reversed.
When that happens, our side will likely
nominate and confirm lower court judges
and Supreme Court nominees with 51 votes,
regardless of whether the Democrats actu-
ally buy into this fanciful notion that they
can demolish the filibuster on lower court
nominees and still preserve it for Supreme
Court nominees.
That is the end of my quote from
about 6 years ago when Senator Reid
was doing the nuclear option.
It so happens that very day did come,
and the American people elected Presi-
dent Trump with a Republican major-
ity in the Senate and the House in No-
vember 2016. Senate Democrats have
since engaged in a unprecedented cam-
paign to prevent a whole range of gov-
ernment positions from being filled by
President Trump. It used to be under-
stood that it was in the American peo-
ple’s interest to have a functioning
government, even if your candidate
didn’t win the Presidency.
The norm around here for hundreds
of years used to be that a new Presi-
dent’s Cabinet positions were filled as
soon as possible. I know that the 2016
election aroused strong feelings and
that many people were deeply dis-
appointed when the candidate they ex-
pected to win did not win to the point
of not being able to accept the outcome
under our Constitution of who was
elected and elected constitutionally.
A similar attitude arose when Presi-
dent Obama was elected with some peo-
ple latching on to the birther con-
spiracy theory that President Obama
was secretly born in Kenya and that
this somehow made his Presidency ille-
gitimate. However, this was always a
fringe movement that Republicans in
Congress did not take seriously and
many refuted it.
The arms race of partisan grievance
has now escalated where U.S. Senators
pander to the ‘‘resistance’’ by pre-
venting President Trump from filling
out his administration more than half-
way through the first term.
Senate Democrats insist on going
through the lengthy motion to end de-
bate even for nominees which there is
little or no opposition. This means
that, after being vetted by the White
House, vetted by the Office of Govern-
ment Ethics, answering a detailed
questionnaire probing every aspect of
the nominee’s life, meeting with Sen-
ators in person, going through a nomi-
nation hearing, and being voted out of
committee, nominees must wait and
wait—sometimes for months and
years—before there is time in the Sen-
ate schedule to file a cloture motion as
the first step to getting to finish ap-
proving or disapproving that nominee.
The Senate must then allow for a in-
tervening day to pass before it can vote
to end the debate, which often passes
overwhelmingly. Yes. You filibuster
something. You have to file a motion,
and yet a lot of times, there is no dis-
agreement that that nominee should be
approved. After all that, the cloture
rule allows for an additional 30 hours of
postcloture debate.
I strongly support the Senate exer-
cising its constitutional power, and
that power is about advice and consent.
If there are any concerns about any
nominee’s ability or willingness to do
his job and whether that nominee is
willing to follow the law, Members
should come to the floor to hash
through the merits of the nominee.
However, Members on the other side
of the aisle have obstructed the con-
firmation of a large number of actually
noncontroversial sub-Cabinet nominees
and even lower court judges who were
not controversial. In a great many
cases, the demand for a cloture vote
appears to be solely about delaying and
about obstructing, not anything about
the specific nominee or his qualifica-
tions.
As chairman of the Committee on Fi-
nance this session, I want to highlight
the experience of some of the nominees
considered by the Finance Committee.
So far this Congress, the Finance Com-
mittee has reported seven nominees
that were originally reported last Con-
gress but were not confirmed last Con-
gress because of the obstruction.
I want to make clear that the Fi-
nance Committee has a very thorough
as well as bipartisan vetting process.
Any nominee that has been reported by
the Finance Committee can verify that
we do not rubberstamp nominees.
However, with the exception of one of
the seven nominees that were re-
reported, all of them have been re-
ported unanimously or with a max-
imum of two no votes. Only one of
those seven, however, has been con-
firmed.
The U.S. Tax Court is a place where
taxpayers are able to challenge an as-
sessment of tax before actually paying
the amount that they are challenging.
It is important that we keep the full
roster of 19 Tax Court judges as full as
possible. I don’t think any member of
my committee or this Senate would
disagree with what I just said. I also
am not aware of any criticism of the
nominee currently on the Executive
Calendar for the Tax Court.
That nominee has been reported
unanimously from the Finance Com-
mittee twice now, last Congress and
this Congress; yet there is no certainty
about when that nominee will be able
to consider—or when the Senate will be
able to consider that nomination.
This is very unfair to nominees who
submit to an extensive vetting process
and put their professional lives on hold
so that they can serve. And it is also
unfair to the American taxpayer who
needs these people to be working.
It is also unfair to the American tax-
payers who need these people to be
working. After all, government is a
service.

for Justice issued dire warnings about

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2171
April 2, 2019
a judicial vacancy crisis. At that time,
there were 65 unfilled seats on the U.S.
district courts, and this was crippling
the ability of those courts to dispense
justice and to protect the rights of the
American people. Senate Democrats
picked up on these talking points and
forcefully made their case.
There are now 129 vacancies on the
district courts—129. The concern from
Democrats has somehow disappeared.
Last Congress, I was chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee. By the
end of last year, I had moved more
than 30 highly qualified district court
judges to the floor. Most of them had
languished there for months. A few had
been in the confirmation process since
2017. This is all because Democrats in-
sist on 30 hours of debate for every
nominee even though they often end up
voting for them. Some of these who
had been filibustered were passed al-
most unanimously by the Senate.
In the Judiciary Committee, when I
was chairman, we had several more
judges ready to be reported out of com-
mittee, but they were likely to face
similar obstruction. I haven’t been Ju-
diciary chairman for 3 months. We are
in a new Congress, and I assumed a dif-
ferent chairmanship. Do you know how
many of those district court nominees
have been confirmed in the new Con-
gress, meaning the same ones we had
voted out last Congress? Zero. The va-
cancy crisis, by the Brennan Center’s
definition, has nearly doubled because
of this obstruction.
Clearly, it is a waste of this body’s
time to use all 30 hours of debate after
the cloture vote for almost every nomi-
nee who comes before the Senate. The
Senate was intended to be a delibera-
tive body. If Senators want to engage
in debate on a nominee, then by all
means have that debate; however, don’t
make the Senate go through the mo-
tions if you have no intention of actu-
ally engaging in debate.
There is now before the Senate a pro-
posal to limit postcloture debate on
sub-Cabinet-level nominees. This pro-
posal was very similar to one that
passed the 113th Congress with over-
whelming bipartisan support. A num-
ber of Senators from the other side of
the aisle supported that measure at
that time. If they can’t support it this
time around, what is their justifica-
tion? Again, we cannot have a different
set of rules depending on which party
is in the majority. We need to agree on
a common set of rules and a common
set of norms that apply regardless of
which party has the White House and/
or the majority in the Senate.
I note that there are quite a number
of Senators who see themselves in the
White House in 2020. They are coming
to Iowa every week. Do they really
want to live under the precedent they
are setting now? If a Senator who votes
against virtually every Trump nominee
gets into the White House, how should
this Senator proceed? If one of the cur-
rent Senate Democrats running for
President gets elected in 2020, I, of
course, will be disappointed, and I sure-
ly won’t agree with most of their poli-
cies. So then should I vote against all
of their nominees?
I would ask each of these Presi-
dential candidates: Do you expect this
Senate to behave differently than you
are right now if in the future the shoe
is on the other foot?
I don’t want to be part of a resistance
against a future Democratic President.
I don’t want to live by two sets of
rules. The solution is to end now this
partisan total war where the other side
must be stopped at all costs. We need
to come to a bipartisan agreement to
end this tit-for-tat, cut-off-our-nose-to-
spite-the-face environment. That is the
environment we find ourselves in
today.
Senator LANKFORD’s resolution builds
on the bipartisan agreement from 2013,
but it is not perfect. If Democrats have
legitimate concerns, let’s work to-
gether on something better.
I have heard that the only change the
Democratic leadership has proposed is
to delay the effective date of the stand-
ing order until the start of the next
Presidential term. Presumably, that is
due to the same hubris that led them
to invoke the nuclear option without
imagining that they would soon regret
it, as now they do regret it. We had two
Supreme Court nominees to prove that
they regret it. We actually approved
those two Supreme Court nominees. It
is impossible to defend their position
on principle.
Surely there are some Members on
the other side of the aisle willing to
work in good faith with Republicans to
resolve this impasse in a way that
takes into account the legitimate con-
cerns of Senators on both sides of the
aisle. I don’t believe it is too late to
bring the Senate back to the delibera-
tive body the Framers of the Constitu-
tion intended the Senate to be. It is in
all of our interests to have a more
functional Senate. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in working toward
that goal.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii is recognized.
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, most
Americans don’t wake up every day
thinking about the arcane rules of the
Senate. They might think the debate
we are having today is just another ex-
ample of a legislative body they see as
out of touch on the issues they care
about most, issues on which a large
majority of Americans agree action
should be taken.
For example, the Republican Senate
hasn’t done anything about the epi-
demic of gun violence. The Republican
Senate hasn’t taken action to expand
access to affordable, quality, universal
healthcare. Instead, Republicans have
tried to take healthcare away from
millions of people. The Republican
Senate hasn’t passed comprehensive
immigration reform, let alone offered
the blameless Dreamers a path to citi-
zenship and a life in the only country
they know. The Republican Senate
hasn’t taken decisive action to combat
climate change. The Republican Senate
hasn’t taken steps to empower our
middle class. Instead, it passed a huge
tax cut for the wealthiest Americans
and corporations.
We should be having a real debate
about all the issues I just mentioned.
Instead, Republican leadership is pro-
posing a resolution to, among other
things, change Senate rules to reduce
the number of hours of postcloture de-
bate time from 30 hours to 2 hours for
district court nominees.
Let me just mention, by the way,
that there is a world of difference in re-
quiring 51 votes to put people on the
district and circuit courts versus what
the Senate majority leader did in
changing the vote requirements for
people on the U.S. Supreme Court,
changing that to a bare majority—a
huge difference in putting in a 9-mem-
ber Supreme Court with a bare major-
ity of votes versus some 800 circuit and
district court judges. If we can’t see
that difference, I have no words for
that. We should see that difference.
Getting back to what is before us
today, the significant rule change will
help Donald Trump and his Republican
enablers in the Senate to more swiftly
pack our district courts with ideologi-
cally driven judges—judges who will
make biased rulings in line with their
personal ideological beliefs and not
based on the law or the Constitution.
Our district court judges, appointed
by Democratic and Republican Presi-
dents alike, have been at the frontline
of resisting Donald Trump’s abuses of
power. They have, for example, ordered
the government to reunite parents
with the children ripped from their
arms at the border. They have rejected
attempts to deny Federal funds to cit-
ies refusing to be drawn into the
Trump administration’s war on immi-
grants. They stopped Executive orders
aimed at kneecapping public sector
unions. They blocked the implementa-
tion of an ugly ban on transgender
Americans serving in our military.
They stopped the Commerce Depart-
ment from putting a citizenship ques-
tion in the census. They ruled that
public officials cannot block citizens
from their Twitter feeds. They stopped
the government from banning Muslims
from entering the United States. They
stopped a decision that would have al-
lowed States to require Medicaid re-
cipients to work in order to receive
benefits.
These exercises of judicial independ-
ence by our district judges are pre-
cisely why Donald Trump and his con-
gressional enablers want to make it

easier to pack our courts with nomi-
nees handpicked by the far-right Fed-
eralist Society and Heritage Founda-
tion. These organizations have spent
decades and millions of dollars oppos-
ing universal healthcare, strengthening
corporate interests, and undermining
voting. They have also spent decades
and millions putting their kinds of
judges on the courts, with their life-
time positions.
If we aren’t able to take as much
time to examine their records and pub-
licize their lack of fitness, Trump’s
nominees will soon occupy more and
more of the lifetime appointments on
the bench. Once they do, they will not
only be more inclined to side with his
extreme view of Executive power, they
will also start ruling in cases con-
sistent with the ideologies they bring
to their jobs—for example, that abor-
tion should be illegal; that Americans
don’t have a right to healthcare; that
voter suppression is OK; that families
with same-sex parents should be dis-
criminated against; that transgender
teenagers should be forced to be some-
one they are not; that Presidents can
ban people from our country based on
their faith; that one person’s religious
beliefs can trample the civil rights of
everyone else. Trump’s nominees have
extensive records of their positions on
these kinds of issues.
It used to be that appointees to the
Federal district courts generally did
not generate a lot of controversy. They
were typically experienced trial law-
yers or prosecutors with solid reputa-
tions in their hometowns, but they
weren’t typically activists or
ideologues. There was a time when
they were mostly White and mostly
male, but starting in the Carter admin-
istration and building steam through
the Clinton and Obama administra-
tions, district court nominees pre-
sented to the Senate were increasingly
diverse, with an emphasis on qualifica-
tions, not ideology. But Donald
Trump’s judicial nominees are, once
again, mostly White and mostly male.
They are now much more ideological
and agenda-driven. He has also nomi-
nated a disproportionate number of
lawyers who do what is called impact
litigation, where they pursue cases to
make political points and undo legisla-
tive decisions.
Some examples of Trump’s dangerous
circuit court nominees include Patrick
Wyrick, who was solicitor general of
Oklahoma and who, together with his
close ally, then-Oklahoma attorney
general Scott Pruitt, tried to dis-
mantle Obama-era protections of clean
air, clean water, and public land.
He was counsel of record on an ami-
cus brief in Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby,
challenging the Affordable Care Act’s
contraceptive coverage requirement.
He also submitted a brief in Humble
v. Planned Parenthood of Arizona,
challenging medication-induced abor-
tion procedures commonly used by
Planned Parenthood.
As deputy general counsel for the
First Liberty Institute, Matthew
Kacsmaryk filed briefs opposing same-
sex marriage, supported a Virginia
school board’s anti-transgender bath-
room policy, and opposed the right of
all women to have their healthcare
coverage include contraceptives.
Michael Truncale, another example,
was a former congressional candidate
and an ideological activist against vot-
ing rights, abortion, and immigration,
who gave public speeches using the
widely debunked myth of in-person
voter fraud to justify Texas’s draco-
nian voter ID laws.
Another example is Wendy Vitter,
who promoted fraudulent claims about
abortion, birth control, and women’s
health at an appearance she initially
failed to disclose to the committee.
These fraudulent claims included the
position that there is a connection be-
tween using birth control and getting
cancer. She has been a public advocate
for extreme restrictions on reproduc-
tive rights.
As deputy solicitor general in the Of-
fice of the Texas Attorney General, J.
Campbell Barker represented Texas
and Whole Women’s Health v.
Hellerstedt, urging the Supreme Court
to uphold Texas’s restrictive anti-abor-
tion statute. The Supreme Court de-
clined to do that, thankfully. He also
supported Donald Trump’s Muslim ban,
advocated for the invalidation of DACA
and DAPA, supported restrictive voter
ID laws, opposed the right of all women
to have their healthcare coverage in-
clude contraceptives, and I could go on
and on.
These nominees have deeply held per-
sonal, ideological views who want to be
judges for life to make these views into
law.
During their confirmation hearings,
these nominees told us, to a person, he
or she would ‘‘follow the law’’ and ‘‘fol-
low precedent,’’ but do they really ex-
pect us to believe they can set aside
their careers of ideological activism? I
don’t think so. They were nominated
precisely because they are advocates
for an ideologically conservative agen-
da—just the kind of nominees who
would get the stamp of approval from
the Federalist Society and Heritage
Foundation. That is why my Repub-
lican colleagues support them, and
that is why they want to pass this reso-
lution—to pack the courts with these
types of judges even faster.
Many Americans are awakening to
the fact that court-packing is a clear
and present danger to a woman’s right
to choose, voting rights, healthcare ac-
cess, environmental protections, civil
rights, and individual rights. Not con-
tent with the court-packing damage
they have already done, Republicans
are using this resolution for court-
packing to happen even faster.
I cannot support this resolution.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRUZ). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President,
today I rise to discuss the importance
of upholding the Senate’s constitu-
tional obligation to provide advice and
consent on nominations.
Many people refer to the Senate as
the world’s greatest deliberative body
because the Senate is designed for the
careful consideration and debate of
proposed laws and nominations. That is
why we have so many people sitting up
in the Gallery today, because they are
here to hear debate.
How we deliberate is governed, of
course, by a set of Senate rules. I am
sure some of them seem archaic when
our visitors hear about quorum calls
being vitiated, but it is very important
to have rules because rules stay in
place no matter who is in charge and
no matter what matter is before us.
Rules create a sense of decorum and
fairness not only in this Chamber but
for our country.
Only once in the history of the clo-
ture process in the U.S. Senate has the
Senate voted to permanently reduce
the time we have to debate an issue.
That happened in 1986, when we went
from 100 hours of something that is
called postcloture debate time to the
current rule of 30 hours. That basically
means there are 30 hours to debate
something really important, such as
the nomination of a Supreme Court
Justice, an ambassador, or who is
going to be a Cabinet member. That is
the way the rules are now. While there
have been contemporary changes to the
rules, we have not seen a permanent
rule change since 1986.
The resolution we are considering
asks us to make a second permanent
change. What is the backdrop? Last
Congress, the Rules Committee consid-
ered a proposal from Senator
LANKFORD to cut off debate on the Sen-
ate floor. The resolution before us is
even more damaging because it would
reduce debate time from 30 hours to 2
hours for about 80 percent of the nomi-
nees who come before the Senate—in-
cluding Federal district court judges—
giving only 2 hours on this floor to de-
bate.
We have time to debate these judges
on the Judiciary Committee, but only
a small percentage of the Senators are
on that committee, right? Over 75 per-
cent of the Senators aren’t on that
committee. We also know we have had
some judges come before us, and we
don’t find out things about them until
the debate on the floor occurs or Sen-
ators haven’t decided how they are
going to vote until they actually come
to the floor. We have had judges who
were thrown out—who were rejected,
basically—before they came up for a
vote because of things that were dis-
cussed among Senators when they were
on the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2173
April 2, 2019
Let’s face it. Most Americans are un-
derstandably unfamiliar with the term
‘‘postcloture’’ debate. They don’t ex-
actly have the book on Senate proce-
dures on their reading list, but the
issue before us has a real impact on the
daily lives of every person in this coun-
try, and we should be sounding the
alarm bells about it.
Healthcare—think of what we just
learned this last week when suddenly
the Justice Department for this admin-
istration announced they were going
all out to repeal the Affordable Care
Act. What does that mean? Well, for
every American—not just Americans
who are on the exchanges under the Af-
fordable Care Act—for every American,
it would mean they would lose their
protection for preexisting conditions.
It would mean, if someone has diabe-
tes, if someone has a child with Down
syndrome, if someone in their family
had a preexisting condition, their
healthcare coverage would be subjected
to the whims of the insurance compa-
nies.
Right now we have protections in
place. What does this mean for the rule
we are talking about? In the case that
started in Texas, that was a Federal
district court judge who made the deci-
sion on that case. The people who an-
nounced it out of the Justice Depart-
ment at the higher levels actually went
through confirmation on this Senate
floor so people could debate whether
they should be confirmed. The people
implementing it at the Department of
Health and Human Services, at the
management levels, also go through
this Senate for confirmation.
Guess what, America. Now not only
is this administration trying to ram
through the repeal of the Affordable
Care Act, which would mean you would
lose your insurance if you have a pre-
existing condition, but now they are
trying to ram through the people who
would make the decision—the people
who would do the work.
Instead of having 30 hours to debate a
Federal district court judge just like
the one who made the decision in Texas
or instead of having 30 hours to debate
employees at the Justice Department—
managers who would make decisions or
higher supervisors who would make the
decisions—we would get 2 hours. To
me, what is this about? It is about ram-
ming nominations through just like
they tried to ram the Affordable Care
Act repeal through the justice system
in that announcement last week.
For every Congress, there are 1,200 to
1,400 positions in the executive branch
requiring the Senate’s advice and con-
sent. Under this resolution, 277 of those
would get the full 30 hours of debate,
including the Supreme Court, circuit
court, and the Cabinet-level positions,
as well as some of the people who serve
on the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission and some of the Commissions
we have. That accounts for 277, but
that leaves many more—over 1,000—
who would only get 2 hours of debate, 2
hours for what are lifetime appoint-
ments. Hundreds of these positions—
hundreds of these positions—are life-
time appointments.
I believe in this place, once called the
world’s greatest deliberative body, it is
our constitutional duty to fully vet the
most senior people in our govern-
ment—the people who help ensure our
air and water are clean, the people who
lead our military, and the people who
oversee our justice system. It is our
constitutional duty to fully vet our
Federal judges, those men and women
who receive lifetime appointments to
uphold the rule of law in America.
On behalf of every American, it is our
job to make sure the people nominated
to the most senior positions in our gov-
ernment are competent and qualified.
These roles are so important that the
rules of the Senate are designed to en-
sure that Senators come to a bipar-
tisan consensus. They don’t always do
that, but guess what. Sometimes we
do. The purpose of these rules is to re-
ject partisanship so we can get nomi-
nees who will put the good of the coun-
try before politics.
If we eliminate this crucial check on
our democracy, allowing the majority
party to ram through these appoint-
ments, we will undermine our democ-
racy and our government.
Some of our friends on the other side
of the aisle who are trying to push this
through point to the fact that in 2013,
the Senate voted 78 to 16 to tempo-
rarily change the postcloture rules on
debate time, but it is very important
to note that in 2013, the circumstances
were very different from what they are
today. Nominations required a 60-vote
threshold. The blue-slip process for all
judicial nominees was respected—un-
like now, where it is no longer re-
spected—for the highest courts in the
land, such as the circuit courts. A thor-
ough process—and this is important—
to select qualified judicial nominees
was in place but no longer. Have you
seen the statistics that President
Trump has had more unqualified nomi-
nees than past Presidents who have
been rejected by this body?
Despite all of this, important Federal
positions remained unfilled, even
though qualified nominees were wait-
ing to be confirmed. To address the
issue, a bipartisan supermajority of the
Senate supported a temporary change
in the rules, but that is not what is
happening today.
The idea that we are facing similar
circumstances in this Congress is un-
supported by the facts as well as state-
ments made by some of my Republican
colleagues. The truth is—as we have
heard the majority leader of this body
boast—nominees are getting con-
firmed, some at paces faster than we
have seen in U.S. history.
In 2017, Leader MCCONNELL himself
highlighted this fact. He said: ‘‘Senate
Republicans are closing in on the
record for the most circuit court ap-
pointments in a president’s first year
in office.’’
Last year, President Trump said:
We have the best judges. We put on a tre-
mendous amount of great federal district
court judges. . . . We are setting records.
He was right about setting records.
In the first 2 years of his Presidency,
President Trump had 85 judges con-
firmed. That is because they focused on
getting them through, compared to
just 62 for President Obama in the
same time period.
President Trump has had 30 circuit
court nominees confirmed during his
first 2 years in office. This is more cir-
cuit court nominees confirmed than
any President in history.
That is why they have talked about
getting these nominees through like on
a conveyor belt. So then the question
becomes, why change the rules? Why
change the rules? Why change the rules
for lifetime appointments and give
only 2 hours of debate?
This change is not just unnecessary,
it would allow fundamentally unquali-
fied candidates, from judges to admin-
istration officials and Ambassadors, to
be confirmed.
The American Bar Association has
rated six of the judicial nominees put
forward by the administration as ‘‘not
qualified,’’ including three who re-
ceived that rating unanimously, two of
whom were confirmed. In 2 years, more
than 30 executive branch nominees and
5 Federal judges have been withdrawn
after initial vetting. Because nominees
are being rushed through the com-
mittee process, postcloture time is
critical to our job of evaluating nomi-
nees and fulfilling our duty to advise
and consent.
For the 78 Senators who do not serve
on the Judiciary Committee, this is a
critical time to talk to colleagues and
staff about a judicial nominee’s record.
Maybe we don’t use the whole time de-
bating them, but guess what happens
when you are not marching through
these 2 hour blocks of time. You have
more time to talk about nominees to
each other and evaluate their records.
Last year, two nominees were with-
drawn from consideration after their
cloture votes had been taken—Thomas
Farr, for the Eastern District of North
Carolina, and Ryan Bounds, for the
Ninth Circuit, Oregon. The withdrawal
of these nominees happened on a bipar-
tisan basis. Senators SCOTT, Flake, and
RUBIO voiced their disapproval.
Bounds’ nomination failed and was
withdrawn partly because Senator
RUBIO changed his mind during that
postcloture debate time. These cases
show how critical postcloture debate
time is for considering nominations. He
found out new information that he
didn’t know before.
Nominees like these clearly dem-
onstrate the importance of carefully
and thoroughly considering nominees
for executive branch positions and life-
time appointments to the bench. The
American people deserve qualified
nominees, and it is our job to ensure
that we take the time and care nec-
essary to confirm people who will serve
their country with distinction.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2174 April 2, 2019
I appreciate Senator LANKFORD. We
work together on many issues—most
notably, on election security. But this
legislation will remove important
checks and balances on a permanent
basis, not just on a temporary basis. It
happens at a time when we have seen
unprecedented numbers of judges con-
firmed on the circuit basis and a total
number of judges much higher than we
saw during the same first 2 years of the
Obama administration. We also know
that we are getting a slew of unquali-
fied nominees.
Finally, we know that this adminis-
tration just keeps trying to push
things through that I consider—and the
courts have considered—unconstitu-
tional.
Right now, we have the President
going around Congress and the $1.3 bil-
lion of appropriated money that was
given for security and saying: I am just
going to take money away what this
Congress has appropriated for other
things and use it to build an $8 billion
wall.
Not only does that create legal and
constitutional issues of eminent do-
main at the border, but it also creates
constitutional issues about the separa-
tion of powers and the role of this Con-
gress.
We are at a time when this adminis-
tration has decided to wreak havoc on
people’s healthcare by pushing for the
repeal of not just part but of the entire
Affordable Care Act, which I noted in-
cludes those provisions that protect
people from being kicked off their in-
surance for preexisting conditions. The
people who make these decisions at the
highest levels—at that sub-Cabinet
level, which is right under the Cabinet
level, the judges who are making these
decisions on the district court level,
and the workers who are at the higher
sub-Cabinet levels at the Justice De-
partment and at Health and Human
Services, who would make decisions di-
rectly about people’s healthcare—are
the ones we are talking about with this
resolution. These are real issues for
real people. While this may all sound
esoteric, this is not a time in history
to be permanently changing the rules
and ramming through a bunch of nomi-
nees.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to be able to speak
for up to 10 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, the
Senate is in a bad spot. In the first 2
years of President Trump’s Presidency,
there were 128 times that the President
sent over a nomination and the minor-
ity party has said: We want additional
time to be able to debate those folks.
These are individuals who have al-
ready gone through vetting at the
White House. They have already gone
through FBI checks. They have already
come to the committee. They have
done full vetting at the staff level, then
had a full hearing at the Member level,
and then had questions for the RECORD.
They passed out of the committee,
then had a lapse of time, and then a
majority vote was set up to be able to
move them. At that time, there was a
request for additional time 128 times.
Just to do a quick comparison of how
common that is—because folks say this
is normal and this is the way the Sen-
ate functions all the time—for Presi-
dent Obama, in his first 2 years, that
happened 12 times. For President Bush,
that happened a total of 4 times. For
President Clinton, that happened a
total of 8 times. But for President
Trump, it happened a total of 128
times.
This is a new way of operation for
the Senate, and I really should say it is
a new way of not operating for the Sen-
ate. It is an issue that has to change. It
is not just about President Trump. It is
about this body, who we are going to
be, and how we are going to operate.
In the past, when there was a nomi-
nation from a President, there was the
assumption that the President was
elected and they could hire their staff.
Now the resistance has stepped up and
said: The President is elected, but we
will not let you hire a staff, and we will
not let you put your policies in place
because we want to prevent you from
getting any people into a spot.
Guess what. As soon as there is a
Democratic President elected—and at
some point in the future, there will
be—Republicans will retaliate back to
that and say: We will do the same
thing. You can’t hire your staff.
This is a new precedent that has been
set. If we don’t correct it, it is dam-
aging to our Republic. A President
should be able to hire their staff. All of
the Agencies need Senate-confirmed in-
dividuals to be able to actually conduct
their business. We need judges to be
able to execute across the country.
Those are basic things that need to
occur.
I have heard folks say: Well, there
has been no problem getting judges
through. In fact, Republicans have
bragged about the total number of
judges coming through.
Let me give you a comparison. If we
stay on the same pace right now with
judges—just for the district court
judges, which are the most common
judges across our country—and Presi-
dent Trump is in office for 8 years, he
will have put in 193 judges. President
Obama put in 272 judges. It is factually
not true that we are able to ram
through all of these judges to be able
to work through the process. We are
not on an epic pace.
There has been a higher number for
circuit court judges, which is correct,
because this Senate has prioritized
working on circuit court judges, but
that is to the detriment of everything
else because you can’t do all of it be-
cause there is this constant request for
additional time at the end of it.
Again, I have heard folks say that
two hours is not enough time to be able
to debate. That would be true only if 2
hours was the only thing that was allo-
cated for debate. These individuals
have already been through vetting at
the White House and vetting in com-
mittee. They have gone through the
process and have been approved. This is
not 2 hours of time. It is actually 26
hours of time because people are con-
veniently leaving out the fact that
there is an intervening day required.
We are talking about nominees moving
from 54 hours of floor debate time to 26
hours of floor debate time. It is just
convenient to leave out that extra day
that happens to be in there, if you want
to make the argument.
Our simple conversation is this: How
can we get the Senate back to work
again? In 2013, Harry Reid led a move-
ment, which 78 Senators approved of,
to be able to say that for 2 years—2013
and 2014—we would fix the nominations
process in the Senate. There was wide
agreement to be able to do that. At the
time, Harry Reid stood on the floor and
said: Now, let me make this clear. We
shouldn’t have all of these nominees go
through postcloture and all the debate
on the floor anyway. Most of these
passed through committee. They
should be done by voice vote. In the
rare exception that someone has to
come to the floor, let’s limit the floor
time because it is not really used any-
way. It is just a tactic to delay.
If you need evidence of that, there is
all of the conversation that has re-
cently been held on this floor about de-
bate and about how we need to have all
of this additional time for debate be-
cause these are lifetime appointees,
these are essential people, and so they
need to have a debate on the floor
about them. Let me tell you what that
really looks like in real life. That
sounds very sanctimonious here on the
floor.
In real life it looks like this. Here are
the circuit court judges we have con-
firmed this session of Congress so far.
These are for the circuit court. This is
the appellate court. These are very im-
portant folks in the process. These
folks currently have 30 hours, and for
all of these folks, there was a demand
to get 30 hours of extra debate time on
the floor because they were so impor-
tant.
Here is the actual problem. When
that 30 hours of debate time was done
and was blocked off, and that was re-
spected, the first of the circuit court
nominees actually got on the floor 1
hour and 16 minutes of actual debate,
not 30 hours. People actually coming to
the floor and debating that nominee
was 1 hour and 16 minutes. The next
nominee had 18 minutes and 57 seconds
total of debate on this floor, although
30 hours of debate was blocked off,
which meant most of the time the floor
was empty, waiting for someone to ac-
tually debate. The next nominee was 1
hour 23 minutes.
Then, there is one my favorites. A
circuit court judge had 4 minutes and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2175
April 2, 2019
22 seconds of actual debate when 30
hours of debate was demanded for this
lifetime appointment. The next circuit
court judge was 23 minutes and 6 sec-
onds.
The next one for the DC Circuit was
actually very controversial. There was
lots of noise about this nominee: 47
minutes and 28 seconds.
It is one thing for folks to say these
are lifetime appointments so we need
to make sure we block off a significant
period of time on the floor. It is an-
other thing to actually see the facts.
These folks have gone through com-
mittee and we all know it. They have
gone through background checks and
we all know it. Every one of these indi-
viduals has been cleared and we know
the outcome of all of these. We should
respect each other and acknowledge
that if this body is going to do legisla-
tion and personnel, no one can lock up
the body and demand 30 hours of time
on a nominee when we actually use 4
minutes and 22 seconds.
If we want to shift it off of judges and
shift it onto executive nominees, re-
cently we had a demand for 30 hours of
additional debate time from our Demo-
cratic colleagues for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics nominee. They de-
manded extra time because they were
so controversial. On this floor, there
was exactly zero minutes and zero sec-
onds of debate on that nominee.
You see, this is not about actually
debating whether people are qualified
or not qualified. This is about pre-
venting President Trump from getting
nominees by locking up the floor and
making sure he can’t actually hire
staff or can’t actually put people on
the court.
This will be reciprocated in the days
ahead for every Democrat, and it will
be done to every Republican President
in the future if we don’t fix this now.
We had 2 years and 3 months of bad
muscle memory on a process that
should not be like this and has not
been like this in the past. We can fix
this.
When there was a Democratic Presi-
dent and a divided city, led by Demo-
crats at the time, Republicans joined
Democrats to be able to fix that nomi-
nation process for a Democrat Presi-
dent. The mistake we made was to do
it only for a 2-year time period. We
should learn from our mistake, and we
should fix this from here on out. This
is doable.
To give an example, in the last ses-
sion of Congress, 386 nominees were
never heard on this floor. They were
sent back at the end of Congress and
told: You have to start all over again.
Those are folks who quit their job,
went through FBI background checks,
went through reviews, went through
hearings, and confronted all the ques-
tions that were brought at them, and
386 of them were then stalled out and
never heard. They were sent back to
the White House.
That means that in the future we
will have less opportunity to get more
people who are qualified to be able to
apply for this. We want the best of the
best to actually come and serve in our
government. We will not get that if
people have to quit their jobs to go
through the nomination process, wait a
year or 2 years, and then get sent back
and told: You have to start all over
again to go through the process.
Who will want to go through that
process in the days ahead? We need to
fix this both for the nominees who are
going through the process and the Sen-
ate, which needs to have a better proc-
ess of actually expediting nominees
through. Quite frankly, we need to fix
it for the country.
It is a simple process. It is not trying
to gain partisan advantage. Regardless
of who is in the White House, it is try-
ing to fix it for the long term. Let’s fix
it this week. We have talked about this
for 2 years. We have floated different
proposals. Let’s fix it this week and,
from here on out, have a better process
in the Senate.
Why in the world are we arguing
about our rules of the Senate when we
should be worrying about the issues
the American people face? Of all
places, of all people, we should have
fair rules in the Senate to actually
have a debate, have a vote, finish, and
then move on to the next thing. There
is more to be done.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak on the
floor for no more than 15 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is
an issue coming up before the Senate
this week which really goes to the
heart of this institution and why it ex-
ists. The Constitution spells out re-
sponsibilities for Congress and specific
responsibilities when it comes to this
Chamber. The 100 men and women who
serve today, among other things, have
a responsibility to advise and consent
on nominations that have been sent by
the President for our consideration.
The Constitution assigns the Senate
the role of questioning these nominees,
of checking into their backgrounds,
and then of deciding whether to ap-
prove or disapprove their nominations.
Over the past 2 years, we have seen
many of the guardrails in this process
disappear. For example, the Republican
majority has stopped respecting blue
slips on circuit court nominations.
Blue slips, which are a Senate tradi-
tion, say that if a person is nominated
to serve on the circuit court, which is
the second highest court in the land,
the Senators from the State within
which that person would serve would
decide with a thumbs up or a thumbs
down as to whether the nomination
will go forward—the so-called blue slip.
For a number of years now, that has
been the U.S. Senate’s standard prac-
tice, its tradition. The Republican ma-
jority has decided to stop the blue-slip
process when it comes to circuit court
nominations.
It also has stopped moving bipartisan
board and commission nominations in
pairs. We used to say: We have a more
trusting relationship if you get your
Republican nominee and if we get our
Democratic nominee. Let’s do it to-
gether. That used to ensure that both
parties would be equally represented on
important Agencies, such as the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission, the
National Labor Relations Board, and
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion, to name a few.
Now we have a rules change before us that
is being proposed by the Republican side of
the aisle—again changing the rights of Sen-
ators by limiting the debate time on nomina-
tions. This would further tilt the balance of
power away from the Senate, away from
Congress, and back towards 1600 Pennsyl-
vania Avenue, the Executive. It runs the
risk, of course, of diminishing our constitu-
tional responsibility.
When it comes to executive branch
nominations, this administration has
had a different approach than what we
have seen before. We have a President
who says he likes to have administra-
tion officials serve in an acting capac-
ity.
In January, President Trump said:
I sort of like acting. It gives me more flexi-
bility. Do you understand that? I like acting.
Given that approach, perhaps it is no
surprise that we have seen long delays
in filling leadership positions in impor-
tant Agencies and ambassadorial posts.
We have also seen the highest rate of
turnover in modern time with these ad-
ministration positions. People aren’t
placed in these positions, and if they
are, they are looking for the exit way
too soon.
We also have suffered from a lack of
proper vetting and examination of a
person’s background before a nomina-
tion is approved, and we have seen a
lack of bipartisan cooperation in mov-
ing board nominations when there is
supposed to be an equal number of
Democrats and Republicans. Despite
that, we are trying to do the work we
were assigned by the Constitution to
advise and consent.
If the majority wants to move Execu-
tive nominations faster, it can do what
all administrations have done in the
past and start working with the minor-
ity to negotiate packages of nominees.
As long as I have been here, that has
been done by the leaders of both polit-
ical parties—fair, bipartisan packages
of Executive nominees who have been
well vetted. None of us wants the em-
barrassment of putting a person in the
position for which one is not qualified
or when there is any question of one’s
ethical standards. That bipartisan

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2176 April 2, 2019
work can lead to less debate time on
the floor if we agree at the outset to
work together.
I am particularly opposed to the Re-
publican proposal before us to shorten
the time for debate on President
Trump’s nominees who will serve life-
time appointments in Federal district
court. Imagine serving a lifetime ap-
pointment on a court—beyond this ad-
ministration—and making day-to-day
decisions, some fundamental to the
criminal justice system and some to
the civil justice system.
We understand what is really going
on here. We understand when the other
side says we are obstructing it from
confirming judges. The facts don’t tell
the same story. In fact, my Republican
colleagues have been bragging for
months about what Senator MCCON-
NELL called the ‘‘record number’’ of
judges the Senate has confirmed under
this new President Trump.
In President Trump’s first 2 years in
office, the Senate confirmed 85 article
III judges. During the first 2 years of
President Obama’s Presidency, it was
62. Eighty-five to sixty-two. The num-
ber of judges confirmed in the last Con-
gress was nearly four times as many as
the number confirmed under President
Obama in the previous Congress.
The pace of judicial nominations and
confirmations has been extremely fast.
So why are the Republicans now push-
ing for a change to the Senate rules to
make it even faster? It is not like the
Senate has been busy with legislation
here on the floor.
Senator MCCONNELL had a moment of
candor last November after the elec-
tion.
He said:
I think we’ll have probably more time for
nominations in the next Congress than we’ve
had in this one. . . . I don’t think we’ll have
any trouble finding time to do nominations.
Senator MCCONNELL, McClatchy News, No-
vember 7, 2018.
Of course, Senator MCCONNELL was
frustrated that one Senator put a blan-
ket hold on judicial nominees at the
end of last year, and he expressed his
frustration publicly. That Senator, in-
cidentally, was not a Democrat; he was
Republican Senator Flake of Arizona.
It seems the real reason the Repub-
licans want to change the rules now on
district court nominations is so, in the
words of Senator MCCONNELL, they can
‘‘plow right through’’ with confirming
nominees whose records and views are
incomplete or extreme.
The reality is that all too often,
these judicial nominees just don’t
stand up to scrutiny. Already, under
President Trump, we have had six judi-
cial nominations in which the Amer-
ican Bar Association’s peer-review
process found these nominees sent by
President Trump to be ‘‘not qualified.’’
I might add that there were no—zero,
none—‘‘not qualified’’ nominees under
President Obama.
Last year, two nominees, Thomas
Farr and Ryan Bounds, were withdrawn
on the floor by the Republicans after
the Senate had voted to move forward
on their nominations. Disclosures
about their backgrounds led Members
even on the Republican side of the aisle
to say they wouldn’t vote for them.
They were withdrawn because informa-
tion came to light that caused these
Senators to change their minds about
confirming them to lifetime appoint-
ments. That shows the importance of
having some time—30 hours cur-
rently—to debate these nominations
and to make sure that a lifetime ap-
pointment is not going to someone who
is unqualified or who shouldn’t be in
that position.
So who are the district court nomi-
nees for whom Senator MCCONNELL
wants to change the rules so as to
move them through more quickly? Let
me tell you about a few of them.
There is Texas district court nominee
Michael Truncale, who called President
Obama an ‘‘un-American impostor’’
and described the Shelby County case,
when it came to voting rights, a ‘‘vic-
tory.’’
There is Nebraska nominee Brian
Buescher, who ran for elected office in
2014 and said: ‘‘I will focus on fighting
ObamaCare.’’
There is Texas district court nominee
Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has repeat-
edly written in his personal capacity
about his opposition to LGBTQ rights
and the Obergefell case.
There is Oklahoma district court
nominee Patrick Wyrick, who is a pro-
tege of disgraced former EPA Adminis-
trator Scott Pruitt’s. He allowed an en-
ergy company to ghost-write a letter
from Pruitt’s office when he was Okla-
homa’s attorney general.
These are just a few. There are many
other Trump judicial nominees whose
views are far outside the legal main-
stream, and Republicans are deter-
mined, with these rule changes, to
speed up the process so we don’t ask
questions.
I have to say it is stunning to listen
to Republicans complain about ob-
struction of judicial nominees after
watching the unprecedented Repub-
lican obstruction of nominees under
President Obama.
Under Senator MCCONNELL, Repub-
licans would not even give an appoint-
ment for an interview, let alone a hear-
ing, to a well-qualified Supreme Court
nominee—Merrick Garland.
In 2013 Republicans pledged they
would filibuster anyone who President
Obama nominated to the DC Circuit
Court of Appeals, the second highest
court in the land. No matter how quali-
fied the nominee, they pledged to block
him or her because President Obama
was making the choice.
Republicans filibustered President
Obama’s judicial nominees 82 times in
the first 5 years. Under all Presidents
before President Obama, there had
been a total of 86 judicial filibusters
combined with all Presidents. Under
President Obama, in the first 5 years,
there were 82, and throughout history
leading up to that, 86.
Now that the Republicans control the
White House and the Senate, they want
to rip up the rules and change the tra-
ditions and guardrails on the judicial
nomination process on a regular basis.
They are pushing through nominees
who have not been found qualified by
the American Bar Association. They
are pushing through nominees over the
objection of home State Senators.
They are pushing these nominees with-
out making sure that they have seen
their complete records.
In the case of a North Carolina dis-
trict court nominee, Thomas Farr, his
nomination was pulled when critical
documents were finally disclosed while
his nomination was pending on the
floor of the Senate.
It is no secret what is happening
here. There is no emergency that justi-
fies changing the Senate rules. Senator
MCCONNELL himself admitted the Sen-
ate has plenty of time to consider
nominees. This is all about avoiding
close scrutiny for extreme ideological
nominees that Republicans want to
pack onto the Federal courts for life-
time appointments.
I oppose the rules change. Let’s do
our job when it comes to conducting
due diligence and providing informed
advice and consent for lifetime ap-
pointments to the Federal bench. It
can be done.
I will tell you that in the first years
of the Trump administration, we have
been able, by and large, to work out bi-
partisan agreement on filling judicial
vacancies in the State of Illinois, even
at the circuit court level, to the point
where Senator DUCKWORTH and I gave
blue-slip approval to circuit court
nominees based out of our own State,
and to the point where we have reached
a basic agreement when it comes to
filling the district court vacancies to
this point. It has been bipartisan all
the way, and I believe we have found
qualified people. It took some time and
some bipartisan cooperation, but we
did. It can be done. We didn’t ask to
have the rules changed in the Senate.
We used the existing rules to do our job
under the Constitution.
All the issues we care about are im-
pacted by these nominees in my State
and others. The Senate deserves to
take the time to make sure we get this
right. We should not be putting men
and women into lifetime appointments
without close scrutiny as required by
our Constitution.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 7
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I
come to the floor today not in celebra-
tion but in frustration to once again
mark Equal Pay Day. It has now been
50 years since Congress passed the
Equal Pay Act. It is a bipartisan law
signed by President Kennedy and in-
tended to ensure equal pay for equal
work. While this was a strong step in
the right direction, the sad reality is
that today the gender wage gap still
very much exists.
Today women, on average, make 80
cents for every dollar a White man
makes, meaning the average woman
has to work up until today to earn
what her male colleagues made in 2018.
For women of color, the pay gap is
even worse. African-American women
working full time only make 61 cents
for every dollar a White man makes,
meaning they have to work until Au-
gust to earn what a White man made in
2018. American Indians make only 58
cents for every dollar, meaning they
have to work until September to catch
up with their White male colleagues.
Latinas, on average, are paid 53 cents
for every dollar their White male col-
leagues make. They will have to work
until November—almost a full year—to
earn what White men made last year.
The wage gap also hurts mothers
who, on average, only make 71 cents to
every dollar fathers earn. The gender
pay gap starts when women are enter-
ing the workforce, and it widens
throughout their careers. Pay inequity
will cost the typical woman more than
$400,000 over the course of a 40-year ca-
reer. Sadly, by the way, that number
tops $1 million for Latina women,
meaning women have to work longer
and still have less to save for retire-
ment.
The gender wage gap doesn’t just
hurt women; it hurts families, commu-
nities, and the economy. Women are
the primary or sole breadwinner in
more than 40 percent of American fam-
ilies, meaning families have less money
to pay for groceries, childcare, support
businesses in their communities, and
stay financially secure and inde-
pendent.
That is why it is so important that
we pass the Paycheck Fairness Act
today—not tomorrow, not next year.
We need to pass this now. Every year
the wage gap grows, and it is far past
time we close the loopholes in the
Equal Pay Act and give women the
tools and the protections they need to
be sure they are being paid fairly.
This should not be a partisan issue.
The Equal Pay Act was passed with bi-
partisan support. The Paycheck Fair-
ness Act passed the House last week
with Republican support. Women
across the country, regardless of their
skin color, where they live, or whether
they are Republican or Democratic, de-
serve to be paid the same as their male
colleagues doing the same work.
I hope my colleagues across the aisle
will join us today in supporting this
critical legislation. Our economy can
only succeed if women can succeed.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent that the Senate proceed to the
immediate consideration of H.R. 7,
which is at the desk; that the bill be
read a third time and passed; and that
the motion to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no
intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
the distinguished Senator from Wash-
ington and I often agree on issues, and
for the most part we agree on this. We
agree that equal pay for equal work is
the right thing to do. What I would add
is that equal pay for equal work is al-
ready the law.
Paycheck discrimination on the basis
of gender is wrong. It is already illegal
in the United States. Congress prohib-
ited discrimination based on gender in
the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The Equal Pay Act is very clear: ‘‘No
employer . . . shall discriminate . . .
between employees on the basis of sex
by paying wages to employees . . . less
than . . . he pays . . . employees of the
opposite sex . . . for equal work . . .
which requires equal skill, effort, and
responsibility, and which are per-
formed under similar working condi-
tions. . . . ’’
Equal pay for equal work. That al-
ready is the law; therefore, it is unnec-
essary to have yet another law saying
basically the same thing. I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, let
me just respond by saying the Pay-
check Fairness Act that we are asking
to go today and have been denied the
opportunity to do so makes very im-
portant updates to the Equal Pay Act.
It reaffirms that every worker in
America has the right to receive equal
pay for equal work. It protects women
from retaliation for talking about sal-
ary information with coworkers. It al-
lows women to join together in class
action lawsuits, and, importantly, it
prohibits employers from seeking sal-
ary history so the cycle of pay dis-
crimination cannot continue.
This bill has the support of Repub-
licans and Democrats and millions of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2178 April 2, 2019
workers in this country, and I really
hope this Senate can reconsider and
bring this important piece of legisla-
tion up that has passed the House.
I thank my colleagues who are out
here today supporting this effort.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York.
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to associate myself with
the comments of the Senator from
Washington. She is exactly right.
We are rising today to speak about a
very disturbing annual milestone that
we are once again marking today.
Today is known as Equal Pay Day, and
here is what it means.
The average woman has to work 15
months just to get paid what the aver-
age man earns in 1 year alone. The rea-
son today is Equal Pay Day is that it is
today in the new year when the aver-
age woman finally gets paid what the
average man earned the year before. If
you are a woman of color, on average,
you have to work even longer just to
get paid what the average man earns in
1 year.
It is outrageous that we still don’t
actually have equal pay for equal work
in this country, and it is the year 2019.
It is shameful that women all across
this country are being underpaid for
the hard work they are doing every
day. It is disgraceful that the gender
wage gap is as wide as it is. This is hap-
pening in a moment in our Nation’s
history when women, more than ever
before, are working outside the home,
when many women are the actual pri-
mary breadwinner or the sole bread-
winner for their family.
This is an alarming, glaring reminder
of how badly our economy is failing so
many workers and their families all
over the country. Above all else, it is a
reminder to all of us that as a country,
we are still struggling to value women.
We are still struggling to protect
women from wage discrimination,
pregnancy discrimination, workplace
harassment, and unfair minimum
wage; that we are still struggling to
ensure that women and their families
have access to paid leave, affordable
daycare. All of these things add to the
gender wage gap and make it even
worse.
If a woman isn’t getting paid a fair
wage, the way she actually deserves,
the wage she earned by putting in the
hours of hard work, then that hurts
her, her family, her children. It hurts
our entire U.S. economy. It weakens
the middle class. It is bad for our coun-
try.
There is no excuse for any of this. It
is something all of us should be think-
ing about what we can do to correct,
using our power to correct, because the
fact that we still don’t have equal pay
for equal work in this country is an
embarrassment.
We need equal pay for equal work,
and we need it now. In this Chamber,
we have a responsibility to make sure
our workplace policies and our laws are
actually protecting women, protecting
their families, and protecting our econ-
omy as a whole. One of the best ways
we can actually solve this problem is
by finally passing this law. It is com-
mon sense. It guarantees equal pay for
equal work once and for all.
The good news is we already have a
bill, and it is ready to go right now. It
is even bipartisan. It is called the Pay-
check Fairness Act. It has already
passed the House, and the only thing
stopping it right now is the Senate.
This bill would ban retaliation against
workers who discuss their wages. It
would give the Department of Labor
the tools needed to enforce equal pay
around this country.
Although the Senator claims we al-
ready have laws, they are not working.
So we need better enforcement. It
would prohibit employers from relying
on a salary history of prospective em-
ployees when they are deciding how
much to pay them.
This bill would help end wage dis-
crimination. It would actually make
our families, our country, and our
economy stronger. Don’t you want
that, Madam President?
So what are we waiting for? Congress
needs to step up right now. We need
equal pay for equal work.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 137
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today, along with my col-
leagues, to bring attention to an issue
that I think is important for all of us
women. Today, we are 4 months—92
days, to be exact—into the new year.
Today is the day that American women
catch up in earnings to what their
male counterparts made last year. In
2019—almost 100 years after women
won the right to vote and 56 years after
the passage of the Equal Pay Act—it
still takes women 15 months to earn
what a man makes in 12. That is the
significance of today, Equal Pay Day.
Women make up half of the U.S.
workforce. We are small business own-
ers, entrepreneurs, doctors, lawyers,
and community leaders. Yet women in
the United States still make an aver-
age of 80 cents for every dollar earned
by a man. For women of color, women
with disabilities, and transgender
women, the gap is even more jarring.
Black women earn an average of 61
cents on the dollar, Native American
women earn 57 cents, and Latinas earn
53 cents for every dollar the average
White man makes. This means that
Latinas, who face the highest pay gap
in the country, must keep working
until November 20 this year in order to
earn what their White male colleagues
made in 2018. Women with disabilities
are paid an average of 83 cents for
every dollar a man with a similar dis-
ability makes at a full-time job, and
transgender women can expect their
average yearly earnings to fall by al-
most one-third after their transitions.
In 2019, this is still the reality for
American women. These women are
often the sole breadwinners for their
families.
This type of systemic discrimination
has no place in our country. It is hav-
ing a negative economic impact on
families. As long as the wage gap ex-
ists, women face unfair barriers to suc-
cess and have to fight hard for eco-
nomic security for themselves and
their families.
Full-time working mothers trying to
provide for their families are paid, on
average, $16,000 less per year than fa-
thers. That threatens their ability to
put food on the table or save for their
children’s education. Older women are
likely to have to work longer—by an
average of 10 years—than their male
counterparts to make up their lifetime
wage gaps and earn enough for a secure
retirement. Young women just enter-
ing the workforce can expect to see
their wage gap grow, not shrink, over
the course of their careers.
All of these factors hurt Nevada
women, Nevada families, and our coun-
try. It undercuts American women’s
ability to get ahead, provide for their
families, and save for retirement. In
Nevada alone, women who are em-
ployed full time lose a combined total
of nearly $5 billion each year due to the
wage gap.
It is past time American women earn
equal pay for equal work. Women in
our country will no longer accept being
held back. As a Nevada Latina, it is my
responsibility to use my seat at the
table to ensure that future generations
of women are able to have the support
they need to succeed so that their fam-
ilies can thrive. It is time women re-
ceive the same paycheck as a man for
doing the same job.
I am fighting alongside a longtime
leader for women in Congress, Senator
MURRAY, as well as my Senate Demo-
cratic colleagues, to pass the Paycheck
Fairness Act and provide women with
the opportunities and resources they
need to succeed. I look forward to the
day when equal pay for equal work is a
reality for every woman in Nevada and
across this country.
America’s women are leading the
economy of the future. They are build-
ing the infrastructure that fuels com-
merce, developing the scientific break-
throughs that improve our way of life,
and driving political change. America’s
women are heading America’s compa-
nies, and we need more. That starts
with ensuring equal pay for equal
work. Until we pass the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act, I will continue to fight for
women and their families, to level the
playing field for them, because nothing
less than their future is at stake.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

April 2, 2019
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Utah.
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
Mr. LEE. Madam President, as the
deadline for Britain’s withdrawal from
the European Union fast approaches,
there is an enormous opportunity be-
fore us—an opportunity for free trade
with the United Kingdom. Such an
agreement would provide tremendous
economic and trade benefits to both
nations and would strengthen and pre-
serve our special relationship.
As this deadline approaches, the
United States should stand ready and
willing to negotiate a free-trade agree-
ment with Britain, which is the pur-
pose of the resolution before us today.
This resolution simply declares that it
is the sense of the Senate that, one, the
United States has and should have a
close and special relationship—one
that is mutually beneficial as a trade
partnership and otherwise—with the
United Kingdom and that that rela-
tionship should continue without inter-
ruption; and two, that the President,
with the support of Congress, should
lay the groundwork for a future trade
agreement with the UK.
Some of my colleagues have raised
objections to it. Some have objected,
for example, that this resolution didn’t
go through the Senate Finance Com-
mittee. First, it is important to point
out here that the vast majority of reso-
lutions expressing a sense of the Sen-
ate normally don’t go through the
committee process at all. Second, a
straightforward assertion of friendship,
of support, and of economic partner-
ship with one of our oldest and closest
allies is not by its nature and should
never be controversial.
Others have claimed that the point of
this measure is somehow to lambast
the EU. This misses the point entirely,
which is simply to preserve a unique
and important alliance and promote
America’s economic interests.
Others have said that by encouraging
a free-trade agreement with Britain,
we would be ‘‘picking sides’’ or some-
how affirming Brexit. Significantly,
however, this resolution says precisely
nothing about whether Brexit should
or should not happen. That decision is
up to the British people. But it is up to
us to decide whether to stand with
Britain—the nation that has been one
of our greatest partners, not only in
trade but also in the fight for freedom,
peace, and prosperity throughout the
world. We should stand with the UK
and strengthen this special partnership
by supporting this resolution today.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent that the Senate proceed to the
consideration of S. Res. 137, submitted
earlier today. I further ask that the
resolution be agreed to, the preamble
be agreed to, and that the motions to
reconsider be considered made and laid
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to
object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I
would like to raise a few key points on
this whole matter.
First, this is a question of inter-
national trade, which is a subject that
has been handled by the Senate Fi-
nance Committee for literally decades.
The full committee has not been con-
sulted on this resolution. It is less than
a week old, which, in my view, has not
given Senators an adequate amount of
time to consider it. Suffice it to say,
the prospect of reshaping the American
economy with sweeping trade deals is
not something that ought to just rock-
et past the committee of jurisdiction.
Second, with respect to the substance
of the request, I simply do not believe
it is the role of the United States to
give aid and comfort to the UK’s na-
tionalist right while it inflicts irrep-
arable harm on the UK’s own economy
and citizens.
Third, thinking kind of objectively
about the future, I don’t believe any-
body can pretend to know what the UK
and its relationship with Europe is
going to look like even in the near fu-
ture. The Senate simply cannot make
promises about trade talks months or
years down the line when the May gov-
ernment doesn’t even know what is
coming down the pike in a matter of
days.
Finally, there are serious issues that
need consideration with respect to our
trade relationship with the UK and Eu-
rope. That cannot happen if the de-
bates play out in a slapdash process
here on the floor of this Senate.
For example, European governments
are in the process of implementing a
new copyright regime that provides an
easy way to chill free speech online
with bogus copyright claims. A number
of European governments, including
the UK’s, have proposed new digital
services taxes. Let me repeat that. A
number of these governments have pro-
posed new digital services taxes. What
they are attempting to do is loot
American technology companies with
discriminatory taxes—slapping what is
essentially an extra tariff on American
firms.
The UK would need to commit to
abandoning these unfair policies,
which, in my view, are serious barriers
to trade, as a precondition of negotia-
tions in the future. Otherwise, if the
Senate were to, in effect, make prom-
ises on trade in the dark, we would risk
surrendering our negotiating positions
on these key issues which I have out-
lined without getting anything in re-
turn.
For the life of me, I just can’t see the
case for undermining our American
businesses and American jobs for the
benefit of the UK’s nationalist right as
they steer their own economy and
international stature off a cliff.
For those reasons, Madam President,
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Madam President, this isn’t
complicated. All we are trying to do
here is to say that the United States
has and probably should have without
interruption an ongoing, special, vi-
tally important trade relationship with
the United Kingdom and that the
President and the Congress of the
United States should work toward an
agreement to that end.
That isn’t rocket science. It is not
complicated. It is not even in itself a
framework for a specific statute or for
a specific trade bill. It is laying out a
very broad principle—one that I would
hope every one of us would accept and
would embrace.
We have to remember that one of the
reasons we are a country, one of the
reasons we don’t fly the Union Jack or
sing ‘‘God Save the Queen,’’ one of the
reasons we declared independence near-
ly two and a half centuries ago has a
lot to do with the fact that, as Ameri-
cans, we understand that what we need
access to is not so much proximity to
government, proximity to the Crown,
as proximity to other people. It is how
human thriving occurs. It is how the
human condition is able to be elevated.
It is a free market system that has ele-
vated more people out of poverty than
any government program ever has, ever
could, or ever will.
Yes, what we need is access to mar-
kets. That is part of what prompted
the American Revolution, the fact that
our merchants, our manufacturers, and
our farmers were being excluded from
markets and were being discriminated
against by the Crown. We understood
that would necessarily limit economic
mobility within the country and was
artificially holding us back. That is
why we became our own country. That
has a lot to do with why we declared
independence.
Over time, we have benefited sub-
stantially from free markets, from free
trade. We have seen the greatest econ-
omy—in fact, the greatest civilization
the world has ever known—in the
United States of America. That oc-
curred not because of a government; it
is not a result of who we are; it is a
consequence of what we do, the deci-
sions we have made. A lot of those de-
cisions have been based on free mar-
kets.
With respect to my distinguished col-
league, my friend, the Senator from Or-
egon—with respect to his suggestion
that this is somehow weighing in on
the merits of a political cause that he
might not like in another country,
that is really not our business, and this
resolution is completely agnostic on
that point. This resolution doesn’t re-
quire us to hold hands with Great Brit-
ain. This resolution doesn’t require us
to say that the United Kingdom can do
no wrong. This is not a bill calling for
us to make America Great Britain
again. No. This is here only to protect
and promote free trade because free
trade makes us free. Free trade makes
us prosperous. We should not walk

PROTECT STUDENTS ACT
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise
today to join my colleague from Illi-
nois, Senator DURBIN, to discuss the
work we are doing to protect students
and taxpayers from predatory higher
education practices. I want to thank
Senator DURBIN for his incredible and
steadfast leadership on this issue.
All hard-working students deserve
the opportunity to receive a quality
education that will prepare them to
compete in this 21st-century economy.
Education is the cornerstone of ex-
panding opportunity, and it is vital
that we ensure that more students
have access to quality, affordable high-
er education that will help them
thrive.
Unfortunately, too often, hard-work-
ing students, including our veterans
and servicemembers, are taken advan-
tage of by predatory for-profit colleges.
We have seen this issue time and again.
Years ago, we witnessed the collapse
of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., and ITT
Tech. Recently, we saw the collapses of
Education Corporation of America,
Vatterott College, and Dream Center
Education Holdings. Students attended
these institutions with the hope of fur-
thering their education and building
better lives for themselves and their
families.
In reality, though, these companies
were raking in billions of taxpayer
funds that enriched their executives
and investors, all while their students
were receiving subpar degrees at high
costs even though they were often re-
cruited with the promise of a good-pay-
ing job after graduation. This has left
tens of thousands of student borrowers
with huge amounts of debt that they
will never be able to repay, credits or
degrees of little value, and few job
prospects.
Unscrupulous actions by for-profit
colleges have also widely impacted our
country’s veterans who bravely fought
in defense of our freedoms and then, in
turn, were taken advantage of by pred-
atory, corrupt schools.
Our current system has done little to
stop these bad actors. Students and
taxpayers have been exploited in as-
tounding ways and to an outrageous
degree. We need to do more to address
and to stop these predatory practices.
That is why I was pleased and honored
to join with Senator DURBIN last week
to introduce the Preventing Risky Op-
erations from Threatening the Edu-
cation and Career Trajectories of Stu-
dents Act of 2019, otherwise known as
the PROTECT Students Act.
This legislation would implement a
number of commonsense protections to
hold predatory institutions, including
for-profit schools, accountable when
they engage in unfair, deceptive, and
other fraudulent practices.
To start, the PROTECT Students Act
would safeguard our veterans and serv-
icemembers from predatory practices.
It would close a loophole in existing
law that allows colleges to count GI
benefits as non-Federal dollars toward
a required 10 percent of their revenues
that must be from a non-Federal
source. This has led some predatory
for-profit schools to deliberately and
aggressively recruit veterans and even
provide false information to them re-
garding their programs, including the
expected level of student debt and what
kinds of jobs would be available to the
students once they graduate. By clos-
ing that loophole through the PRO-
TECT Act, we can eliminate the incen-
tive for these schools to prey on vet-
erans and prevent veterans from going
into significant debt for a credential or
degree of little practical or economic
value.
Next, this legislation would add a
new review process for for-profit insti-
tutions that seek to convert to non-
profit or public status—something they
have been doing as a strategy to escape
key accountability requirements.
Our bill would also take steps to en-
sure that career education programs
actually prepare students for good-pay-
ing jobs because if students invest
thousands of dollars in their education,
they should be able to find a job that
will help them pay back their loans.
The PROTECT Students Act would
also codify the 2014 gainful employ-
ment regulation that helps prevent
students from enrolling in low-quality
programs that charge more than what
a student can reasonably pay back
after they graduate. This provision re-
quires improvement by schools whose
students are found to have too much
debt compared to their earnings, and it
cuts off Federal financial aid for those
schools that don’t improve. The meas-
ure also has the obvious benefit of pre-
venting Federal taxpayer dollars from
being wasted on worthless programs.
The PROTECT Students Act would
help student borrowers who have been
cheated or defrauded by predatory in-
stitutions, including for-profit col-
leges, by improving the process for bor-
rowers to have their loans forgiven if
the school they attend engages in
fraud.
This legislation would increase con-
sumer protections by banning the prac-
tice of mandatory arbitration, which
has limited students’ ability to seek
legal action if they have been de-
frauded.
These are just some of the vital steps
the PROTECT Students Act would
take. This bill would be a strong step
forward for both students—including
veterans and servicemembers—and tax-
payers.
We are at a time when the Depart-
ment of Education, led by Secretary
Betsy DeVos, is doing everything in its
power to undermine protections for
students on these issues. Secretary
DeVos has done a disservice to stu-
dents by hiring into the Department
officials who have close ties with com-
panies that have defrauded students.
They then, unsurprisingly, have sup-
ported her mission of rolling back stu-
dent protections in favor of predatory
companies. Secretary DeVos has
worked to gut key consumer protec-
tions and weakened relief for students
who were victims of fraud. This is un-
acceptable. By supporting the PRO-
TECT Students Act, Members of the
Senate can send a message to Sec-
retary DeVos that we will not stand for
these actions.
I want to take a moment to thank
my friend and colleague, Senator DUR-
BIN, for his consistent leadership on
this issue. For years, Senator DURBIN
has been sounding the alarm about the
dangers of for-profit colleges, intro-
ducing legislation, and taking to the
Senate floor and bringing much needed
attention to this matter. It is time
that more of our colleagues listen to
his calls to stop these predatory insti-
tutions from taking advantage of stu-
dents all across the country.
Senator DURBIN, thank you again for
leading on this issue. I am thrilled that
we have been able to work together to
introduce the PROTECT Students Act,
and I look forward to working with you
to pass this legislation as part of the
reauthorization of the Higher Edu-
cation Act.
Thank you.
I yield the floor to my colleague from
Illinois.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate Democratic whip.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me
thank my colleague from New Hamp-
shire for being my ally in showing real
leadership on this issue.
As a member of the HELP Com-
mittee, you will be sitting there in
those key hearings when we discuss the
reauthorization of higher education.
That will be our opportunity to bring
in some of these reforms that make a
difference in terms of this industry of
for-profit colleges and universities. I
thank you for that, and I join you in
this PROTECT Students Act, as I have
come to the floor so many times to
talk about this sector.
Most Americans don’t know what we
mean by for-profit colleges and univer-
sities. Who are they? Well, some of the
familiar names are the University of
Phoenix, DeVry University and others
like it, which portray themselves as in-
stitutes of higher education, and in

some respects, they bear similarity.
Yet when it comes to the actual per-
formance of these schools, it is much
different. Many families don’t know
the difference.
I find in the city of Chicago, IL, that
students—particularly when they reach
their junior and senior years—are inun-
dated with all this advertising on so-
cial media about for-profit colleges and
universities.
I would say to Senator HASSAN, there
was a time in Washington before she
arrived where you could find television
ads that showed a young lady who ap-
peared to be about 20 years old, in her
pajamas, saying: I am here in my paja-
mas going to college at a for-profit col-
lege and university.
They tended to make it sound like it
was a pretty easy formula. All you
needed to do was log on, and the next
thing you knew, you had a diploma, a
certificate, and you were off for em-
ployment. That is not the real-world of
for-profit colleges and universities. The
real world is a much starker place.
I have often said that you can define
this issue between for-profit colleges
and universities and non-profit and
public universities and colleges in
America with two very simple num-
bers. This will be on the final. The
numbers are 9 and 34. For-profit col-
leges enroll 9 percent of all postsec-
ondary students. Nine percent go to
for-profit schools. Thirty-four percent
of all Federal student loan defaults are
students from for-profit colleges and
universities.
Nine percent of the students and 34
percent of the loan defaults. What is
going on here? The answer is very obvi-
ous, and it really tells the story about
for-profit colleges and universities.
They charge too much. All the sur-
veys we looked at say their tuition is
higher than you might run into at a
local community college or a public
university or a not-for-profit school.
They charge too much tuition.
Secondly, too many students drop
out before they finish. They are in so
much debt, they can’t continue.
Third, those who do finish and get a
diploma find out it isn’t worth much.
They don’t really end up in a job where
they can pay off their student loans, so
they stumble and fall despite their best
efforts, deep in debt from these for-
profit colleges and universities. Along
the way, they learn something inter-
esting: These credits they are sup-
posedly earning at the for-profit col-
leges and universities often can’t be
transferred anywhere. No one recog-
nizes them.
These students have been lured into
something called a ‘‘college’’ or ‘‘uni-
versity,’’ lured into deep debt, and if
they finish, they find they have some-
thing that isn’t worth a job in the fu-
ture. Senator HASSAN and I are trying
to protect these families and these stu-
dents from this type of exploitation.
We know and I think most Americans
know that going to college can be an
expensive experience, but it can be a
life-changing experience for the better.
If you pick the right school and get
yourself a college education, you will
be in a better position, in most cases,
when it comes to your future life.
Right now, we are finding that when it
comes to these schools, there is a much
different outcome.
Throughout this higher education de-
bate, you are going to hear a common
refrain from this industry. They often
say that different types of institutions
of higher education shouldn’t be treat-
ed differently under the law, that ev-
erybody should play by the same rules.
They go on to say that any regulations
or requirements that apply only to for-
profit colleges discriminate on the
basis of tax status.
Last week, Secretary of Education
Betsy DeVos accused me of discrimi-
nating based on tax status, for-profit
versus nonprofit. I couldn’t care less,
from my point of view, whether it is
for-profit or nonprofit; the question is,
What are they giving to these stu-
dents? What are the students receiving
for the money that is being paid?
In her final report to Congress, re-
tired Department of Education Inspec-
tor General Kathleen Tighe wrote:
‘‘The [for-profit college] sector con-
tinues to be a high-risk area for the de-
partment.’’ She went on to say that the
industry’s own practices and perform-
ances ‘‘provide a clear demonstration
of the need for particular account-
ability.’’
Let’s start with the basics. As I said,
9 percent of the students; 34 percent of
the student loan defaults. Students at
for-profit colleges graduate with an av-
erage debt of nearly $40,000; students at
nonprofit and public colleges and uni-
versities, $28,000. In 2014, more than
half of the top 25 schools whose stu-
dents held the most cumulative stu-
dent loan debt were for-profit colleges.
Eight of the top 10 students with the
most debt were for-profit colleges. The
average cohort default rate over 5
years at these eight colleges was 33
percent. Over 5 years, a third of the
students were going to default on their
student loans.
The average, incidentally, for the
two not-for-profit institutions in the
top ten was 6 percent. So, at the end of
5 years, one-third of the students who
graduated from for-profit schools in
the top ten for cumulative student debt
had defaulted. For the students from
the nonprofit schools in the top ten for
cumulative student debt, it was only 6
percent. These for-profit schools are
notorious for luring these students and
sometimes their families into debt, and
then the students can’t find the jobs to
pay off the debt.
A basic reminder: Of all of the debt
you can incur in the United States of
America—think about it—that being
for your home, your car, your boat,
whatever it happens to be—there is one
category of debt you can never dis-
charge in bankruptcy: a student loan.
You are going to carry student loan
debt with you for the rest of your life.
We have a case in which a grand-
mother literally cosigned a note so her
granddaughter could go to college, and
the granddaughter defaulted on the
student loan. Guess what happened to
the grandmother’s Social Security pay-
ment. The government came and took
part of it in order to pay off that stu-
dent loan.
It never, ever goes away. It is a
loan—a debt—for life. That is why it is
different. We can make a mistake on a
home; we can lose a job or have an ill-
ness in the family and default on a
mortgage and have the debt we owe
discharged in bankruptcy, but it is not
so when it comes to student loans.
In a 2017 letter to Secretary DeVos
and congressional leadership, 19 State
attorneys general, led by then-Illinois
Attorney General Lisa Madigan, wrote:
‘‘Over the past 15 years, millions of
students have been defrauded by un-
scrupulous for-profit postsecondary
schools.’’
These chief State law enforcement
officers noted the specific risks to stu-
dents from the for-profit college sector.
The recent closures of so many of
these schools have left these students
stranded. Imagine if your son or daugh-
ter were going to one of these for-profit
colleges or universities, and then it
went out of business. Would that mean
you would have to pay off your student
loan? Technically, yes. In order to be
relieved from your student loan, you
would have to submit a borrower de-
fense claim to the U.S. Department of
Education.
How often do these schools fail? Let
me read to you a list of some of these
for-profit colleges and universities that
have gone failed: Corinthian, ITT Tech,
Education Corporation of America,
Vatterott, and Dream Center.
How many students who attended
these schools were left high and dry
when the schools went out of business?
There were 140,000 students. Of the
more than 218,000 borrowers who have
sought discharges from the Depart-
ment of Education as a result of being
defrauded by their institutions, the
vast majority have been students from
for-profit colleges.
The for-profit colleges promised
them jobs that never materialized. The
for-profit colleges said: If you take the
following course, you can become a
computer technician of some kind. It
never happened. They were defrauded
by these schools. They signed up for
the loans, and then the schools went
out of business. So here they are with
the loans and no jobs.
We have this borrower defense proc-
ess by which the students can go
through the Federal Government to try
to be relieved of their student debt. Yet
I can’t understand this. The U.S. De-
partment of Education is not proc-
essing these students’ borrower defense
applications. When we said to Sec-
retary DeVos, ‘‘Come on. Give these
young kids a break. Their lives are on
hold until they figure out what has
happened to their student loan debt

from their for-profit schools,’’ she
hasn’t gotten around to it, and we have
been waiting patiently for that to hap-
pen. I thank Senator HASSAN for put-
ting a finger on it.
The people who are running this De-
partment of Education are former ex-
ecutives of these for-profit schools. So,
it’s no surprise.
So, no, Madam Secretary. Meeting
our obligation as lawmakers to focus
accountability and protections where
there is the greatest risk to students
and taxpayers is not discriminating
based on tax status; it is acknowl-
edging reality.
The bill we are talking about today
doesn’t target for-profit colleges, and it
doesn’t seek to put an end to for-profit
education. It is not a witch hunt or a
liberal conspiracy; it is a response to
the objective risks to students and tax-
payers that the for-profit college indus-
try represents today.
The PROTECT Students Act would
close the 90/10 loophole. Incidentally,
can you imagine that these are so-
called for-profit colleges and univer-
sities and that they are the most heav-
ily federally subsidized businesses in
America? We took a look around. We
looked at defense contractors and ev-
erything we could think of. The high-
est level of Federal subsidy goes to this
industry.
Imagine, a student signs up. The stu-
dent may first qualify for a Pell grant
of $6,000. The for-profit college takes
that Federal money in. Then the stu-
dent still owes some debt. They say:
Well, you need a government loan. So
the student borrows from the govern-
ment. At that point, all we have seen
across the table are Federal dollars
that are directly out of the Treasury.
The student still carries the debt, but
the money to this so-called private
business is all straight out of the Fed-
eral Treasury—hardly a hearty exam-
ple of capitalism at work.
The 90/10 rule was designed to pre-
vent for-profit colleges from depending
on more than 90 percent of their rev-
enue coming straight from the Federal
Treasury. It didn’t work. Unfortu-
nately, a loophole in the law only
counts the Department of Education’s
title IV funds as Federal revenue while
counting billions from the Department
of Veterans Affairs’ GI bill and the De-
partment of Defense tuition assistance
as non-Federal funds.
Here is what it means: If you are
serving in our military and are entitled
to GI bill education benefits that are
going to help pay for your education,
for-profit colleges have a financial in-
centive to aggressively target and re-
cruit you. It turns out they can take
virtually 100 percent of their revenue
directly from the Treasury by enrolling
large numbers of students eligible for
Federal benefits that are not included
in the 90/10 rule. We think that is
wrong. We think the 90/10 rule should
count these veterans’ benefits and
other Federal education benefits as
Federal funds.
I see there are others on the floor,
and I am not going to make this any
longer. I will bring it to a close because
Senator HASSAN has covered the ele-
ments of this bill that I think are very
important.
To my friends who serve with me in
the U.S. Senate, here is what it boils
down to: Do we care about these stu-
dents and their families? Are we wor-
ried about the fact that 9 percent of
the postsecondary students end up at
for-profit schools and account for over
one-third of all student loan defaults?
Are we willing to hold these schools ac-
countable and every school account-
able so they treat students fairly?
Are we willing to say, for example,
the University of Illinois has a rela-
tionship with its students who enroll?
The University of Illinois does not have
a mandatory arbitration clause, but
many for-profit schools do. What does
it mean? If you feel you have been mis-
treated by the school, those at the
school will sit down and decide your
fate through an arbitration process,
which students virtually always lose.
Most schools don’t do that to their stu-
dents, but these schools look at them
as cash-paying customers, and that is
how they treat them when it comes to
arbitration.
There are a lot of things we can do in
this bill to protect the students who
are currently being exploited. What is
more important than making sure
these students don’t get off to a bad
start in life but are treated fairly and
honestly and not exploited at the ex-
pense of their families and the expense
of American taxpayers?
I thank Senator HASSAN for being the
lead sponsor of this legislation.
I yield the floor.

ator from Arkansas.
ELECTORAL COLLEGE
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I want
to comment briefly on the proposed
constitutional amendment to elimi-
nate the electoral college that my col-
leagues are introducing this week. It is
just the latest radical proposal by the
Democrats to upend our constitutional
system of government.
Why all the sudden interest in these
changes? It is very simple.
The Democrats and their media wing
still can’t get over that they lost the
2016 election, so they have spent the
last 2 years looking for scapegoats.
First, it was the collusion hoax, but
the Mueller report has put an end to
that. Now they blame the Constitution
itself and want to eliminate the elec-
toral college, which they claim robbed
the so-called popular vote winner of
her rightful office.
Let’s be clear about something up
front: We have never had a Presidential
election with a popular vote winner or
loser in the genuine meaning of those
words. It is not how we contest the
Presidency, and it never has been.
Campaigns organize their entire strate-
gies around the electoral college. Guess
what. Hillary Clinton did too. She just
didn’t do it very well. For the losers to
complain afterward that they really
won is like a football team that gets
outscored but says it won the game be-
cause it made more first downs or like
a basketball team that got outscored
but says it won the game because it
made more free throws.
Yet let’s suppose that we do change
the rules of the game. Let’s suppose we
get rid of the electoral college. What
would we get?
Get ready for nationwide recounts
and election contests. If you thought
Bush v. Gore was a circus or that Cali-
fornia’s ballot harvesting operations
were a fraud, wait until you see a na-
tionwide recount. Getting rid of the
electoral college would also encourage
fringe third parties with all of the in-
stability we see in European par-
liamentary elections. Neither can-
didate received 50 percent of the vote
in 2016. Imagine an election in which a
winner would not even get 40 percent of
the vote. How would the Democrats re-
spond to that?
Of course, getting rid of the electoral
college could further reduce the role of
the States in our elections. The Found-
ers believed, rightfully, that the States
were sovereign political communities
that had real interests and real views
that deserved to have a voice in the na-
tional government apart from simple,
nationwide majority rule. The Found-
ers didn’t want our vast continental
Nation to be ruled like colonies from a
few coastal capitals. They wanted our
one, true national officeholder to un-
derstand and account for the diverse
ways in which we work and live and
think.
Under the electoral college, which I
hasten to add is just like in the Senate,
the States can express their will as
States. Hawaiians get to speak as Ha-
waiians about whom the President
ought to be. The same goes for
Vermonters and Arkansans. Doing
away with the electoral college would
be especially harmful to the small
States while it would concentrate
power in big States and in a few
megacities. So it is not surprising to
see Senators from California and New
York and Illinois supporting this rad-
ical proposal. They have obvious rea-
sons to weaken the smaller States.
I have to confess that I am a little
surprised that my colleague from Ha-
waii is joining their effort because it
would relegate his small island State
to the status of a colony—ruled from
afar by a few vast cities on the main-
land. Hawaii, with its 1.4 million peo-
ple, would have less say in our Presi-
dential elections than would San
Diego. It would barely outpace Dallas,
TX.
Politicians who support abolishing
the electoral college say it would break
the supposed stranglehold that rural
red States have on our elections, but
this isn’t really a red or blue issue. Ha-
waii, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the
District of Columbia all have a greater
say about who leads our country,

thanks to the electoral college, and the
last I checked, none of those places are
Republican strongholds nor does one
party ever have a so-called strangle-
hold on the electoral college. It is far
from it. In the 1980s, people spoke
about the Republicans’ electoral col-
lege lock. In more recent times, they
have spoken about the Democratic Par-
ty’s blue wall in the electoral college.
My State and New Mexico, for in-
stance, were fiercely contested in the
Bush era—not so much anymore. In
2008, Barack Obama won Pennsylva-
nia’s 20 electoral votes in a cakewalk.
Eight years later, Donald Trump eked
out a victory in the Keystone State.
Next year, Ohio might not be a com-
petitive Presidential election State,
but Texas may be. Politics can change
fast, and the electoral college changes
with it, which forces candidates to con-
sider our entire vast country. Without
it, a candidate could actually ignore
Wisconsin, yet still win.
I should also point out that my col-
league’s amendment this week is not
the only proposal to scrap the electoral
college. A number of States have also
signed on to a so-called interstate com-
pact that would require those States to
ignore the express will of their voters
and award their electoral votes to who-
ever wins the national popular vote.
It is called the National Popular
Vote Interstate Compact. I would pre-
fer to call it the ‘‘Small State Suicide
Compact.’’
It is designed to circumvent the dif-
ficult process of amending our Con-
stitution, which of course means it is
unconstitutional. There is already a
process for changing the Constitution.
It is called the amendment process.
So I will give some praise to my col-
leagues this week for filing a constitu-
tional amendment to change the elec-
toral college legally, but I would point
out that the Democratic Party’s will-
ingness to bypass our Constitution to
eliminate the electoral college reveals
that what is at stake here is not really
democratic principle but one single
thing—power, seizing it and holding on
to it.
Me? I think I will stick with the Con-
stitution. Alexander Hamilton said of
the electoral college: If it be not per-
fect, it is at least excellent.
I am with Hamilton.

REMEMBERING FRANK K.
PANTLEO
∑ Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I
wish to pay tribute to the bravery and
service of PFC Frank K. Pantleo, a re-
cently passed World War II veteran
from Pueblo, CO, who served with
honor in the Pacific Theater.
Private First Class Pantleo served in
the U.S. Army in World War II from

Combat Battalion. He fearlessly aided
in the Bismarck Archipelago Cam-
paign, the Eastern Mandates Cam-

TRIBUTE TO DANIELLA BOYD
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today
I am pleased to recognize Daniella
Boyd, the Palm Beach County Teacher
of the Year from Royal Palm Beach
High School in West Palm Beach, FL.
Daniella received this award in front
of her students with a surprise visit
from Palm Beach County Super-
intendent Donald Fennoy, her husband,
parents, grandparents and her 7–week-
old son. Her students credit her style of
teaching that allows them to learn
with ease.
Teaching has long been a part of
Daniella’s ambitions, originally focus-
ing on social science in college. Her
time with Teach for America allowed
for her first assignment in a math
class, leading to where she is today. In
order to meet that challenge, Daniella
had to relearn math and considered it a
great opportunity to better understand
how to teach her future students.
Daniella has been a mathematics
teacher at Royal Palm Beach High
School for 7 years and founded the
school’s math honor society and the
Girls Who Code Club. She earned her
master’s degree from Harvard Univer-
sity. She is the eldest child of Ecua-
dorian immigrants.
I extend my sincere gratitude to
Daniella for her tireless efforts to help
her students succeed in math. I look
forward to learning of her continued
success in the years ahead.∑

perience success in all aspects of their
lives. She takes to heart the fact that
her students must learn mathematics
and retain what she has taught in order
to be successful in their next courses,
in college, and beyond.
Makeda models the best practices she
has seen into her classroom to provide

succeed. Her colleagues note her exper-
tise in a wide array of mathematics
practices and keen ability to share this
knowledge with others makes her an
energetic educator and a leader among

TRIBUTE TO HOLLIE CUNNINGHAM
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today
I recognize Hollie Cunningham, the
Marion County Teacher of the Year
from West Port High School in Ocala,
FL.
After Hollie received the teacher of
the year award at the Circle Square
Cultural Center, she credited God with
leading her on this journey. When she
first started college, she was an edu-
cation major and contemplated earning
degrees in teaching or nursing. One of
her professors, Dr. Osteen, gave her ad-
vice she considered an impactful pearl
of wisdom: Dr. Osteen advised her to
become a nurse as she would always
have the chance to teach. She earned
her bachelor of science in nursing from
Florida State University in 2002 and
her master of science in family prac-
tice from the University of South Ala-
bama, College of Medicine in 2011.
Hollie said she left the nursing pro-
fession because God put it on her heart
to become a high school teacher as her
students are worth the effort and sac-
rifice. Hollie teaches certified nursing
assistant, electrocardiograph techni-
cian tech honors, health science foun-
dations II honor, and medical skills
classes and is the department chair for
the vocational department.
She has the opportunity to instruct
young students interested in nursing.
She believes great teachers are always
on call, like doctors and nurses, and
that teaching is a gift, not a degree.
I extend my sincere thanks and grati-
tude to Hollie for her medical work and
dedication to teaching her students. I
look forward to hearing of her contin-
ued success in the years to come.∑

I honor Shannon Kraeling, the Brevard
County Teacher of the Year from Eau
Gallie High School in Melbourne, FL.
Shannon enjoys showing her students
how to use their imagination to create
art and guides them through the learn-
ing experience. She loves teaching the
concept that success comes from perse-
verance, reevaluation, revision, refine-
ment, and failure. Her greatest appre-
ciation is seeing her students’ pride
when they master a skill with which
they initially struggled.
Shannon is responsible for developing
and implementing a curriculum for her
classes and organizes lessons, units,

Joseph challenges his students each
day toward success. His influence on
the school’s campus is seen with all

to the highest achieving, they all note
how tirelessly Joseph works to help
them learn.
Joseph is credited with implementing
several teaching strategies that led to
significant gains in his students’ per-
formance in class and on the SAT. In
his classroom, 78 percent of students

scores increased from 442 to 476 in his
content area for the SAT. They also
saw an increase in the percentage of
students meeting their concordance
score after junior year, rising from 47
to 73 percent in one year.
Joseph is an English III, Honors, Ad-
vanced Placement English language
and composition teacher. He also leads
a mentorship group called Suit Up So-
ciety that is dedicated to mentoring
young men who have grown up without
a positive male influence and to help
improve their lives academically, be-
haviorally, and socially.
I would like to thank Joseph for the

TRIBUTE TO KRISTIN MURPHY
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today
I recognize Kristin Murphy, the
Broward County Teacher of the Year
from Nova Middle School in Davie, FL.
In Kristin’s classroom, being respect-
ful and never lying are the only two
rules. She considered it a high honor to
have been among her peers that were
also nominated for this award. She was
taken aback after learning of their
backstories and the great strides they
are achieving for their schools.
Kristin has been at Nova Middle
School for 3 years and teaches world
history and pre-law. She has been an
educator for more than 20 years. She

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2186 April 2, 2019
Pasion, the Duval County Teacher of
the Year from Sadie Tillis Elementary
School in Jacksonville, FL.
Sarah considered this recognition an
unexpected blessing from God. She be-
lieves teaching is more than a profes-
sion; its role is to serve as an inspira-
tion for students to learn and become
productive members of society. To
Sarah, education is the key to a better
life.
Sarah likes to engage her students in
conversations to help them understand
mathematical concepts, which results
in the students discussing the concepts
amongst one another. When she sees
them agree or disagree with their
ideas, she knows this is a more effec-
tive and efficient strategy to teaching
and helps them to fully grasp the con-
cepts.
Sarah is a 4th grade teacher at Sadie
Tillis Elementary School and is a 15-
year veteran educator in Jacksonville.
Her teaching philosophy has been cred-
ited with improving her school’s grade
from an F to a C through personalized
instruction for each student and by de-
veloping strong professional relation-
ships with her colleagues. Both stu-
dents and teachers take notes from her
instructions and lessons.
I express my sincere thanks and ap-
preciation to Sarah for her dedication
to her students and colleagues. I look
forward to hearing of her continued
success in the years ahead.∑

TRIBUTE TO SHELLI RHODEN
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today
I recognize Shelli Rhoden, the Baker
County Teacher of the Year from
Baker High School in Glen St. Mary,
FL.
Shelli was shocked and humbled to
be named teacher of the year and con-
siders it to be a great honor. Originally
a civil engineer, Shelli became a teach-
er because she wanted to have more
interaction with the local youth and
influence their growth. She enjoys the
opportunity to build relationships with
her students and says that while it can
be challenging, seeing their success
makes it worthwhile.
Each of her students come to class
with different academic and emotional
needs. Shelli tries to meet with them
individually, but knows they can be
distracted with life outside of the
classroom. Though she finds this frus-
trating, humbling, and heartbreaking,
she also finds the relationship and
their questions fulfilling and always
worth the effort.
Shelli is a math and science teacher
and she teaches pre-calculus, algebra 2,
and physics. Aside from teaching,
Shelli cochairs the Positive Behavioral
Intervention and Supports, PBIS, team
and cosponsors the Mu Alpha Theta
math honor society.
I convey my sincere thanks and grat-
itude to Shelli for her work with her
students over the years and look for-
ward to hearing of her continued suc-
cess.∑

the position she is in today, where she
is able to help students with serious
emotional or mental distresses. She
teaches them they are lovable, can love
others, and can learn how to have suc-
cessful emotional regulation.
Helping students has inspired her
every day, and it represents PRIDE—
perseverance, respect, integrity, de-
pendability, ethics—to her. This teach-
es students to be active listeners, how
to have emotional regulation, and also
serves as the foundation of the school
district’s work for its students.
Katharine has a master’s degree in
counseling psychology and is a licensed
mental health counselor. She has
worked with the Okeechobee County
School District for 16 years and as a
crisis counselor for 13 years. She is in-

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–23. A concurrent memorial adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona
urging the United States Congress to provide
full long-term funding for the Payment in
Lieu of Taxes program; to the Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources.
SENATE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL 1002
Whereas, the authority of state and local
governments to promote the highest value
and use of land is critical to funding edu-
cation and other essential government serv-
ices; and
Whereas, under the Federal Land Policy
and Management Act of 1976, federal land

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2188 April 2, 2019
policy changed from one of disposal, in which
land would enter the state tax rolls, to per-
manent federal retention as untaxable public
land; and
Whereas, the State of Arizona is composed
of 113,417 square miles of land, of which 42%
is federally owned, nontribal land that is un-
available for economic development and not
part of the property tax base. Less than 17%
of the land in Arizona is private land; and
Whereas, recognizing the substantial bur-
den this policy change imposed on the abil-
ity of state and local governments to fund
education and other essential government
services, Congress established the Payment
in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program in 1976 to
compensate for the tax revenue that these
governments otherwise would have gen-
erated from the land; and
Whereas, the national average PILT pay-
ment in fiscal year 2018 was $0.91 per acre,
which is far below the amount that federal
lands would return through both value-based
taxation and economic development; and
Whereas, for more than a decade, Congress
has been erratic in the amount and timeli-
ness of PILT payments to Arizona counties;
and
Whereas, funding for fiscal year 2018 PILT
was included in the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2018, totaling $553 million, but the
fate of fiscal year 2019 and future years is
still unknown; and
Whereas, a lack of PILT funding places the
large, unsustainable burden of providing
services squarely on the backs of Arizona
taxpayers and critically impacts the local
budget process and structural solvency of
counties and public school systems; and
Whereas, without regard to the long-
standing debate whether the federal govern-
ment should relinquish control of Arizona
lands, Congress should pay the full amount
in lieu of tax revenue that is denied this
state’s taxing entities as long as the federal
government does withhold state lands from
being subject to tax; and
Whereas, an estimated $9.4 billion provided
by state, county and local monies, including
43% of the state general fund budget, funds
K–12 education in Arizona. The state and
local governments struggle to provide this
and other essential government services, and
proper payment of PILT will help this imbal-
ance; and
Whereas, the federal government has the
duty to reimburse local jurisdictions for the
presence of federally managed public lands
in a reliable and consistent manner.
Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of
the State of Arizona, the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring, prays:
1. That the United States Congress estab-
lish, in coordination with this state, an ob-
jective standard for calculating the value of
PILT payments that are equivalent to the
tax revenue this state, political subdivisions
and school districts would otherwise be able
to generate but for federal control of Arizona
lands.
2. That the United States Congress provide
full, timely and sustainable long-term fund-
ing for the PILT program to help create fi-
nancial stability within Arizona’s counties
and public school system.
3. That the Secretary of State of the State
of Arizona transmit a copy of this Memorial
to the President of the United States Senate,
the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives and each Member of Con-
gress from the State of Arizona.
POM–24. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Iowa urg-
ing the United States Congress to enact leg-
islation to implement a multilateral trade
agreement between the United States, Can-
ada, and Mexico; to the Committee on Fi-
nance.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 10
Whereas, Iowa is a world leader in agricul-
tural production and industrial manufac-
turing, and depends on international trade to
market its products; and
Whereas, Iowa prospers from multilateral
trade with Canada and Mexico, its two larg-
est international export markets, which pur-
chase nearly half of the value of Iowa’s total
exports; and
Whereas, a multilateral trade agreement
between the United States, Canada, and Mex-
ico will support high-paying jobs for Iowans
and build the entire North American econ-
omy; and
Whereas, a multilateral trade agreement
between the United States, Canada, and Mex-
ico should provide safeguards for United
States products to create a more level play-
ing field for America’s workers, modernize
agriculture trade in North America to ben-
efit America’s farmers, and establish new
protections with respect to United States in-
tellectual property, digital trade,
anticorruption, and good regulatory prac-
tices; and
Whereas, multilateral trade agreements
negotiated with bipartisan efforts enjoy
overwhelming support from the United
States business community and farm groups;
and
Whereas, a multilateral trade agreement
between the United States, Canada, and Mex-
ico will reinforce the close relationship we
uphold with our neighbors to the north and
south; and
Whereas, a multilateral trade agreement
between the United States, Canada, and Mex-
ico must be ratified by all three governments
before it can come into effect, including a
congressional vote on legislation to imple-
ment the multilateral trade agreement: Now
therefore, be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives, the
Senate concurring, That the Iowa General As-
sembly recognizes that a multilateral trade
agreement between the United States, Can-
ada, and Mexico will strengthen Iowa’s econ-
omy and benefit Iowa’s farmers and workers,
and urges Congress to enact legislation to
implement such a multilateral trade agree-
ment; and be it further
Resolved, That a copy of this Concurrent
Resolution be distributed to the President of
the United States Senate, the Speaker of the
United States House of Representatives, and
each member of Iowa’s congressional delega-
tion.
POM–25. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of North Da-
kota relative to abortion; to the Committee
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3029
Whereas, a bill prohibiting abortions from
being performed 20 weeks postfertilization
passed in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives in 2013, 2015, and 2017; and
Whereas, in 2017, the bill prohibiting abor-
tions from being performed 20 weeks
postfertilization failed to pass in the United
States Senate by only nine votes, and
Whereas, over twenty states, including
North Dakota, have implemented laws, with
varying exceptions, prohibiting abortions
from being performed 20 weeks
postferilization: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives of
North Dakota, the Senate concurring therein:
That the Sixty-sixth Legislative Assembly
urges the Congress of the United States to
pass a federal prohibition on abortions per-
formed 20 weeks postfertilization; and be it
further
Resolved, that the Secretary of State for-
ward copies of this resolution to the Speaker
of the United States House of Representa-
tives, the President pro tempore of the
United States Senate, and each member of
the North Dakota Congressional Delegation.
POM–26. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Ohio urging the United
States Congress to enact a Born-Alive Abor-
tion Survivors Protection Act as expedi-
tiously as possible; to the Committee on the
Judiciary.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 41
Whereas, If an abortion results in the live
birth of an infant, the infant is a legal per-
son and must be entitled to all the protec-
tions of United States law available to a
legal person; and
Whereas, Any infant born alive after an
abortion or within a hospital, clinic, or other
facility should have the same claim to the
protections of the law that would arise for
any newborn or any person who comes to a
hospital, clinic, or other facility for screen-
ing and treatment or otherwise becomes a
patient within its care; and
Whereas, Without special protection for in-
fants born alive after an abortion provided in
law, these infants are exposed to serious in-
jury or harm and possible death; and
Whereas, A Born-Alive Abortion Survivors
Protection Act would provide the protec-
tions needed so that an infant born alive
after an abortion is treated as a legal person
under, and is protected by, United States
law: Now therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the members of the Sen-
ate of the 133rd General Assembly of the
State of Ohio, hereby urge the Congress of
the United States to enact a Born-Alive
Abortion Survivors Protection Act as expedi-
tiously as possible; and be it further
Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate
transmit duly authenticated copies of this
Resolution to the members of the Ohio Con-
gressional delegation, to the Speaker and
Clerk of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, to the President Pro Tempore
and Secretary of the United States Senate,
and to the news media of Ohio.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2191
April 2, 2019
in communities across the nation. As
Americans, we take inspiration from
those who have answered the call to
serve, whether in defense of our Nation
abroad or to strengthen our commu-
nities at home. The willingness to
serve a purpose greater than ourselves
is a hallmark of our Nation and those
who commit themselves to the better-
ment of our country deserve and have
earned our support. That is why this
year, on National Service Recognition
Day, I am joining Senators COONS and
DUCKWORTH and Congressman LARSON
and other colleagues in introducing the
America’s Call to Improving Opportu-
nities Now (ACTION) for National
Service Act of 2019. Our legislation
calls for a great expansion of the num-
ber of service opportunities and an in-
creased investment in those who serve.
Since 1994, over one million individ-
uals have served through the
AmeriCorps program. Annually, rough-
ly 220,000 seniors over the age of 55 vol-
unteer through the Senior Corps pro-
grams. These individuals have ad-
dressed critical community needs in
education, economic development,
health, and many other areas. They are
among the teams of first responders
when disaster strikes. Unfortunately,
we have not created the capacity to
support all Americans who want to
serve.
The question of service is vital to our
Nation. I was proud to have joined my
friend and colleague, the late Senator
John McCain, in laying out a vision
and plan to support and encourage
service—military, national and pub-
lic—by establishing the National Com-
mission on Military, National, and
Public Service. After meeting with
communities across the country, the
Commission submitted its interim re-
port, which highlighted that Ameri-
cans value service and are interested in
pursuing transformative efforts to in-
volve many more Americans in service.
Yet, the Commission also reported that
there are many barriers to service, par-
ticularly financial ones. Furthermore,
there is a lack of awareness about ex-
isting programs and opportunities.
The ACTION for National Service
Act will honor our national value of
service, while addressing the barriers
that limit citizens’ opportunities to
serve. Our legislation will set us on a
path to one million national service
positions within ten years. It will in-
crease the educational award so that
an individual completing two full years
of service will earn the equivalent of
four years of the average in-state tui-
tion at a public institution. Those who
are willing to serve should not have to
carry a heavy burden of student loan
debt to achieve their educational goals.
The ACTION for National Service Act
will also ease other financial barriers
to service, increasing the living allow-
ance and eliminating the tax liability
for the education awards and living sti-
pends. The bill calls for a robust out-
reach campaign, requiring that all eli-
gible individuals be notified of their
options to serve. Finally, the ACTION
for National Service Act calls for ele-
vating the Corporation for National
and Community Service to a cabinet-
level agency and establishes a National
Service Foundation to leverage private
sector resources to support national
service activities.
Mr. President, it is time we reinvigo-
rate the social contract between Amer-
ica and its citizenry. Americans have a
deep tradition of national service,
starting with the dedicated men and
women of our armed forces and includ-
ing all those who have served in
AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and the
Peace Corps. However, as more Ameri-
cans wish to serve, it is important that
they be given the opportunity to do so.
Just as critical is investing in the edu-
cation and professional development of
those who have sacrificed and given so
much to our Nation. Developing the
talents of our most committed citizens
pays life-long dividends. Our invest-
ment in the GI Bill not only honors our
service members, but also enriches our
Nation. Similarly, the education
awards for those who have served
through our national programs have
economic impacts beyond the individ-
uals who earn them. That is the new
deal that the ACTION for National
Service Act offers.
All AmeriCorps members take a
pledge to get things done for Ameri-
cans, to make communities safer,
smarter and healthier, and to bring us
together. I’d like to thank Senators
COONS, DUCKWORTH, GILLIBRAND, KLO-
BUCHAR, BLUMENTHAL, BROWN, BALD-
WIN, and BLUMENTHAL for signing on as
original cosponsors and urge our col-
leagues to join us in pledging to ensure
that all who want to answer the call to
serve can do so by cosponsoring the
ACTION for National Service Act and
working for its passage.
By Ms. COLLINS:
S. 995. A bill to amend title XXIX of
the Public Health Service Act to reau-
thorize the program under such title
relating to lifespan respite care; to the
Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
today to introduce legislation with my
colleague from Wisconsin, Senator
BALDWIN, to reauthorize the Lifespan
Respite Care Program. Respite care
provides full-time caregivers with the
much-needed opportunity to take a
temporary break from their respon-
sibilities caring for aging or disabled
loved ones.
Every day, an estimated 43 million
family caregivers attend to loved ones
who are experiencing chronic, disabling
health conditions. While many of these
individuals care for an older adult, al-
most one-third of caregivers attend to
persons under the age of 50. Caregivers
help their loved ones remain at home,
often delaying the need for nursing
home or foster care placements. The
value of their efforts is tremendous,
amounting to more than $470 billion in
uncompensated care.
This compassionate task, however,
can take a toll. Caregivers experience
higher mortality rates and are more
likely to acquire acute and chronic
health conditions. Respite care, which
provides temporary relief to caregivers
from their ongoing responsibilities,
helps to reduce mental stress and phys-
ical health issues they may experience,
keeping caregivers healthy and fami-
lies intact. Yet, almost 80 percent of
America’s caregivers have never re-
ceived any respite services.
As a senator representing the State
with the oldest median age in our Na-
tion and as Chairman of the Senate
Aging Committee, the well-being of our
seniors and their caregivers is among
my top priorities. Since the Lifespan
Respite Care Act was enacted in 2006,
37 States and the District of Columbia
have received grants to increase the
availability and quality of respite serv-
ices. Still, the need for respite care
continues to increase and outpace
available resources.
When I ask family caregivers about
their greatest needs, the number one
that I hear is respite. The Maine De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices recognized this urgent need in a
report released in December 2018 on
children’s behavioral health services.
The report recommended expanding ac-
cess to respite care services for fami-
lies. One Maine mother shared, ‘‘Res-
pite has helped our family because we
have been able to take other children
to doctors appointments without ev-
eryone having to go. My husband and I
have been able to have a little time
away. I have been able to attend to my
own mental health needs.’’ From fami-
lies caring for children with disabil-
ities to those caring for older adults,
the need for respite care today con-
tinues to grow.
Our legislation will help to close the
resource gap experienced by our na-
tion’s caregivers. Specifically, the Life-
span Respite Care Act will authorize
robust funding for this program over
the five years, through 2024, to assist
states in establishing or enhancing
statewide Lifespan Respite systems. It
would authorize $20 million for fiscal
year 2020, with funding increasing by
$10 million annually, in order to reach
$60 million for fiscal year 2024. This bill
is widely supported by leading care-
giver and respite organizations, includ-
ing the ARCH National Respite Net-
work and Resource Center, the Amer-
ican Psychological Association, the
Arc, and the Elizabeth Dole Founda-
tion. Mr. President, I ask to include
letters from these supporting organiza-
tions in the RECORD.
Mr. President, there is a large gap be-
tween caregivers who need respite serv-
ices and those who receive it. Our legis-
lation would provide the necessary re-
sources to state respite agencies to en-
sure that more caregivers have access
to the respite services they need. I urge
all of my colleagues to join in support
of this important bipartisan legisla-
tion, the Lifespan Respite Care Reau-
thorization Act of 2019.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2192 April 2, 2019
APRIL 1, 2019.
Hon. SUSAN COLLINS,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
Hon. TAMMY BALDWIN,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
Hon. JIM LANGEVIN,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Hon. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR SENATOR COLLINS, SENATOR BALDWIN,
REPRESENTATIVE LANGEVIN AND REPRESENTA-
TIVE MCMORRIS RODGERS: We, the under-
signed national organizations representing
all ages and disabilities, are writing to offer
our fervent support for and endorsement of
the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization
Act to reauthorize the Lifespan Respite Care
Program at $200 million over five years. We
also want to thank you for your leadership
in supporting the nation’s family caregivers.
Every day, millions of American families
are faced with unexpected illness, disease, or
disability. A soldier is injured in war, a
spouse develops multiple sclerosis or Alz-
heimer’s disease, or a child is diagnosed with
a developmental or physical disability or
chronic illness. These are but a few examples
of events that can forever change an individ-
ual’s and family’s trajectory.
While each situation is unique, the one
thing that they often have in common is the
incredible value of family caregivers. Forty-
three million family caregivers provide a
vast majority of our nation’s long-term care,
permitting individuals of all ages to remain
in their communities and avoid or delay
nursing home or foster care placements.
AARP has estimated that in 2013, family
caregivers provided $470 billion in uncompen-
sated care to adults, a staggering statistic
that exceeds federal and state spending on
Medicaid health services and long-term serv-
ices and supports that same year.
While the benefits of family caregiving are
plentiful, caregiving can take its toll—with
older spousal family caregivers experiencing
higher mortality rates, rates of acute and
chronic conditions, and depression than non-
caregivers. Respite—short-term care that of-
fers individuals or family members tem-
porary relief from the daily routine and
stress of providing care—is a critical compo-
nent to bolstering family stability and main-
taining family caregiver health and well-
being. Respite is a frequently requested sup-
port service among family caregivers, but
85% of family caregivers of adults receive no
respite and the percentage is similar for par-
ents caring for their children with special
needs. Not surprisingly, high burden family
caregivers (defined as those who assist their
loved one with personal care such as getting
dressed or bathing) cite lack of respite as one
of their top three concerns.
To help provide family caregivers the sup-
port they need, the Lifespan Respite Care
Program was enacted in 2006 with strong bi-
partisan support. The program provides com-
petitive grants to states to establish or en-
hance statewide Lifespan Respite systems
that maximize existing resources and help
ensure that quality respite is available and
accessible to all family caregivers. With
more than half of care recipients under age
75 and more than one-third under age 50,
Lifespan Respite rightly recognizes
caregiving as a lifespan issue and serves fam-
ilies regardless of age or disability.
Though the program has been drastically
underfunded since its inception, thirty-seven
states and the District of Columbia have re-
ceived grants and are engaged in impressive
work such as identifying and coordinating
respite services available through various
state agencies, including veterans caregiver
services; helping unserved families pay for
respite through participant-directed voucher
programs or mini-grants to community and
faith-based agencies; building respite capac-
ity by recruiting and training respite work-
ers and volunteers; and raising awareness
about respite through public education cam-
paigns. Originally authorized through Fiscal
Year 2011, enactment of the Lifespan Respite
Care Reauthorization Act is necessary to
continue this excellent momentum, better
coordinate and supply respite care to our na-
tion’s 43 million family caregivers through
statewide Lifespan Respite programs and en-
sure that states are able to sustain the great
work they have begun and still allow new
states to receive a grant.
We thank you for your commitment to in-
dividuals living with disabilities, older indi-
viduals in need of assistance and support,
and the loved ones who care for them and we
look forward to continuing to work with you
as the bill moves forward. If you would like
more information, please contact Jill Kagan.

HARRIS) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary:
S. RES. 134
Whereas, on February 26, 2018, 18 State at-
torneys general and 2 Governors filed a law-
suit in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Texas, Texas v.
United States, No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.)
(in this preamble referred to as ‘‘Texas v.
United States’’), arguing that the require-
ment of the Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act (Public Law 111–148; 124 Stat.
119) (in this preamble referred to as the
‘‘ACA’’) to maintain minimum essential cov-
erage is unconstitutional and, as a result,
the court should invalidate the entire law;
Whereas, in a June 7, 2018, letter to Con-
gress, then Attorney General Jefferson Ses-
sions announced that the Department of Jus-
tice—
(1) would not defend the constitutionality
of the minimum essential coverage provi-
sion; and
(2) would argue that provisions protecting
individuals with pre-existing medical condi-
tions (specifically the provisions commonly
known as ‘‘community rating’’ and ‘‘guaran-
teed issue’’) are inseverable from the min-
imum essential coverage provision and
should be invalidated;
Whereas, in the June 7, 2018, letter to Con-
gress, Attorney General Sessions also ad-
vised Congress that ‘‘the Department will
continue to argue that Section 5000A(a) is
severable from the remaining provisions of
the ACA’’, indicating a difference from the
plaintiffs’ position in Texas v. United States;
Whereas, on December 14, 2018, the United
States District Court for the Northern Dis-
trict of Texas issued an order that declared
the requirement to maintain minimum es-
sential coverage unconstitutional and struck
down the ACA in its entirety, including pro-
tections for individuals with pre-existing
medical conditions;
Whereas the decision of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of
Texas was stayed and is pending appeal be-
fore the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit;
Whereas, on March 25, 2019, the Depart-
ment of Justice, in a letter to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
changed its position and announced that the
entire ruling of the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Texas
should be upheld and the entire ACA should
be declared unconstitutional;
Whereas, prior to 2014, individuals with
pre-existing medical conditions were rou-
tinely denied health insurance coverage, sub-
ject to coverage exclusions, charged
unaffordable premium rates, exposed to
unaffordable out-of-pocket costs, and subject
to lifetime and annual limits on health in-
surance coverage;
Whereas as many as 133,000,000 nonelderly
people in the United States—
(1) have a pre-existing condition and could
have been denied coverage or only offered
coverage at an exorbitant price had they
needed individual market health insurance
prior to 2014; and

(2) will lose protections for pre-existing
conditions if the ruling of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of
Texas is upheld in Texas v. United States;
Whereas, as of March 2019, employers can-
not place lifetime or annual limits on health
coverage for their employees, and if the rul-
ing of the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Texas is upheld,
more than 100,000,000 people in the United
States who receive health insurance through
their employer could once again face life-
time or annual coverage limits;
Whereas, prior to 2010, Medicare enrollees
faced massive out-of-pocket prescription
drug costs once they reached a certain
threshold known as the Medicare ‘‘donut
hole’’, and since the donut hole began closing
in 2010, millions of Medicare beneficiaries
have saved billions of dollars on prescription
drugs;
Whereas, at a time when 3 in 10 adults re-
port not taking prescribed medicines because
of the cost, if the ruling of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of
Texas is upheld, seniors enrolled in Medicare
would face billions of dollars in new prescrip-
tion drug costs;
Whereas, as of March 2019, 37 States and
the District of Columbia have expanded or
voted to expand Medicaid to individuals with
incomes below 138 percent of the Federal
poverty level, providing health coverage to
more than 12,000,000 newly eligible people;
Whereas, if the ruling of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of
Texas is upheld, the millions of individuals
and families who receive coverage from Med-
icaid could lose eligibility and no longer
have access to health care;
Whereas, as of March 2019, many people
who buy individual health insurance are pro-
vided tax credits to reduce the cost of pre-
miums and assistance to reduce out-of-pock-
et costs such as copays and deductibles,
which has made individual health insurance
coverage affordable for millions of people in
the United States for the first time;
Whereas, if the ruling of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of
Texas is upheld, the health insurance indi-
vidual exchanges would be eliminated and
millions of people in the United States who
buy health insurance on the individual mar-
ketplaces could lose coverage and would see
premium expenses for individual health in-
surance increase exorbitantly; and
Whereas, if the ruling of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of
Texas is upheld, people in the United States
would lose numerous consumer protections,
including the requirements that—
(1) plans offer preventive care without
cost-sharing;
(2) young adults can remain on their par-
ents’ insurance plan until age 26; and
(3) many health insurance plans offer a
comprehensive set of essential health bene-
fits such as maternity care, addiction treat-
ment, and prescription drug coverage: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate
that the Department of Justice should—
(1) protect individuals with pre-existing
conditions, seniors struggling with high pre-
scription drug costs, and the millions of peo-
ple in the United States who newly gained
health insurance coverage since 2014; and
(2) reverse its position in Texas v. United
States, No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.).

PRESSING THE GRATITUDE AND
APPRECIATION OF THE SENATE
FOR THE ACTS OF HEROISM AND
VALOR BY THE MEMBERS OF
THE UNITED STATES ARMED
FORCES WHO PARTICIPATED IN
THE JUNE 6, 1944, AMPHIBIOUS
LANDING AT NORMANDY,
FRANCE, AND COMMENDING
THOSE INDIVIDUALS FOR LEAD-

OPERATION THAT HELPED
BRING AN END TO WORLD WAR
II
Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself and Mr.
COONS) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 135
Whereas June 6, 2019, marks the 75th anni-
versary of the Allied assault at Normandy,
France, by troops of the United States, the
United Kingdom, Canada, and Free France,
known as ‘‘Operation Overlord’’;
Whereas, before Operation Overlord, the
German Army still occupied France and the
Nazi government still had access to the raw
materials and industrial capacity of Western
Europe;
Whereas the naval phase of the Allied as-
sault at Normandy was codenamed ‘‘Nep-
tune’’, and the date of June 6, 1944, is re-
ferred to as ‘‘D-Day’’ to denote the day on
which the combat attack was initiated;
Whereas the D-Day landing was the largest
single amphibious assault in history, con-
sisting of—
(1) approximately 57,000 members of the
United States Armed Forces;
(2) approximately 153,000 members of the
Allied Expeditionary Force;
(3) approximately 5,000 naval vessels; and
(4) more than 11,000 sorties by Allied air-
craft;
Whereas soldiers of 6 divisions (3 from the
United States, 2 from the United Kingdom,
which included troops of Free France, and 1
from Canada) stormed ashore in 5 main land-
ing areas on beaches in Normandy, which
were code-named ‘‘Utah’’, ‘‘Omaha’’, ‘‘Gold’’,
‘‘Juno’’, and ‘‘Sword’’;
Whereas, of the approximately 10,000 Allied
casualties incurred on the first day of the
landing, more than 6,000 were members of
the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas the Allied assault and following
operations were supported by ships, aircraft,
and troops from Australia, Belgium, Czecho-
slovakia, Free Norway, Greece, the Nether-
lands, New Zealand, and the Polish Armed
Forces in the West;
Whereas the advanced age of the last re-
maining veterans of, and the gradual dis-
appearance of any living memory of, World
War II and the Normandy landings make it
necessary to increase activities intended to
pass on the history of those events, particu-
larly to younger generations;
Whereas the young people of Normandy
and the United States have displayed unprec-
edented commitment to, and involvement in,
celebrating—
(1) the veterans of the Normandy landings;
and
(2) the freedom brought by those veterans
in 1944;
Whereas the significant material remains
of the Normandy landings found on the Nor-
mandy beaches and at the bottom of the sea
in the territorial waters of France, such as
shipwrecks and various items of military
equipment, bear witness to the remarkable
and unique nature of the material resources
used by the Allied forces to execute the Nor-
mandy landings;
Whereas 5 Normandy beaches and a num-
ber of sites on the Normandy coast, includ-
ing Pointe du Hoc, were the scene of the D-
Day landings and constitute, and will for all
time constitute—
(1) a unique piece of world heritage; and
(2) a symbol of peace and freedom, the
unspoilt nature, integrity, and authenticity
of which must be protected at all costs; and
Whereas the world owes a debt of gratitude
to the members of the ‘‘Greatest Genera-
tion’’ who assumed the task of freeing the
world from Nazi and Fascist regimes and re-
storing liberty to Europe: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes the 75th anniversary of the
amphibious landing of the Allies on D-Day,
June 6, 1944, at Normandy, France, during
World War II;
(2) expresses gratitude and appreciation to
the members of the United States Armed
Forces who participated in the D-Day oper-
ations;
(3) thanks the young people of Normandy
and the United States for their involvement
in events celebrating the 75th anniversary of
the Normandy landings with the aim of mak-
ing future generations aware of the acts of
heroism and sacrifice performed by the Al-
lied forces;
(4) recognizes the efforts of France and the
people of Normandy to preserve for future
generations the unique world heritage rep-
resented by the Normandy beaches and the
sunken material remains of the Normandy
landings by inscribing those beaches and re-
mains on the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (com-
monly referred to as ‘‘UNESCO’’) World Her-
itage List; and
(5) requests that the President issue a
proclamation calling on the people of the
United States to observe the 75th anniver-
sary of the Normandy landings with appro-
priate ceremonies and programs to honor the
sacrifices made by their fellow countrymen
to liberate Europe.

Mr. WICKER (for himself, Ms. CANT-
WELL, Mrs. FISCHER, and Ms.
DUCKWORTH) submitted the following
resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation:
S. RES. 136
Whereas each year, the underground util-
ity infrastructure of the United States, in-
cluding pipelines, electric, gas, tele-
communications, water, sewer, and cable tel-
evision lines, is jeopardized by unintentional
damage caused by those who fail to have un-
derground lines located prior to digging;
Whereas some utility lines are buried only
a few inches underground, making the lines
easy to strike, even during shallow digging
projects;
Whereas digging prior to locating under-
ground utility lines often results in unin-
tended consequences, such as service inter-
ruption, environmental damage, personal in-
jury, and even death;
Whereas the month of April marks the be-
ginning of the peak period during which ex-
cavation projects are carried out around the
United States;

partment of Transportation and the Federal

Communications Commission to establish a
3-digit, nationwide, toll-free number to be
used by State ‘‘One Call’’ systems to provide
information on underground utility lines;
Whereas in 2005, the Federal Communica-
tions Commission designated ‘‘811’’ as the
nationwide ‘‘One Call’’ number for home-
owners and excavators to use to obtain infor-
mation on underground utility lines before
conducting excavation activities;
Whereas the 1,700 members of the Common
Ground Alliance, who are dedicated to ensur-
ing public safety, environmental protection,
and the integrity of services, promote the
national ‘‘Call Before You Dig’’ campaign to
increase public awareness about the impor-
tance of homeowners and excavators calling
811 to find out the exact location of under-
ground lines;
Whereas the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory
Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pub-
lic Law 112–90; 125 Stat. 1904) affirmed and
expanded the ‘‘One Call’’ program by elimi-
nating exemptions given to local and State
government agencies and their contractors
regarding notifying ‘‘One Call’’ centers be-
fore digging; and
Whereas the Common Ground Alliance has
designated April as ‘‘National Safe Digging
Month’’ to increase awareness of safe digging
practices across the United States and to
celebrate the anniversary of 811, the national
‘‘Call Before You Dig’’ number: Now, there-
fore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Safe Digging Month; and
(2) encourages all homeowners and exca-
vators throughout the United States to call
811 before digging.

TURE FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES
AND THE UNITED KINGDOM
Mr. LEE submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the
Committee on Finance:
S. RES. 137
Whereas, on March 5, 1946, Sir Winston
Churchill delivered the Iron Curtain speech
in Fulton, Missouri, solidifying the ‘‘Special
Relationship’’ between the United States and
the United Kingdom;
Whereas, since the end of World War II, the
United States and the United Kingdom have
been beacons of freedom to the world, stand-
ing together in the fight against tyranny;
Whereas the Special Relationship between
the United States and the United Kingdom
has enabled economic prosperity and secu-
rity cooperation for both countries for more
than 70 years;
Whereas, on June 23, 2016, the people of the
United Kingdom voted in support of a ref-
erendum to leave the European Union;
Whereas the United Kingdom is an impor-
tant trading partner with the United States,
with $232,000,000,000 in goods traded between
the two countries in 2017;
Whereas, on October 16, 2018, the United
States Trade Representative expressed the
intention of the President to negotiate a free
trade agreement between the two countries
after the United Kingdom leaves the Euro-
pean Union; and
Whereas the constitutional power of mak-
ing treaties with foreign nations includes
both the legislative and executive branches:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate
that—
(1) the United States should have a close
and mutually beneficial trading and eco-
nomic partnership with the United Kingdom
without interruption; and
(2) the President, with the support of Con-
gress, should lay the groundwork for a future

GEORGIA AT AUGUSTA UNIVER-
SITY
Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr.
PERDUE) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 138
Whereas The Dental College of Georgia (in
this preamble referred to as the ‘‘DCG’’) wel-
comed its first class of students in 1969 as a
result of the efforts of many individuals led
by Dr. Judson C. Hickey, Dr. Louis Boucher,
and Dr. Thomas Zwemer;
Whereas the goal of the DCG is to prepare
students to provide innovative oral health
care for the citizens of the State of Georgia
and beyond by emphasizing education, pa-
tient care, research, and service;
Whereas, 50 years after the DCG welcomed
its first class of students, the goal of the
DCG remains the same;
Whereas the State of Georgia, including
the General Assembly of the State of Geor-
gia, and many benefactors provided funding
for a new state-of-the-art facility for the
DCG, which opened in 2011;
Whereas, as the sole dental college in the
State of Georgia, nearly 400 students and 60
residents are enrolled annually in the DCG;
Whereas, as of February 2019, the DCG has
8 residency programs, including advanced
education in general dentistry, endodontics,
general practice, oral and maxillofacial sur-
gery, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, peri-
odontics, and prosthodontics;
Whereas the DCG also has a fellowship pro-
gram in esthetic and implant dentistry;
Whereas all of the programs of the DCG
provide advanced education in specialized
areas of dentistry; and
Whereas, since 2006, the DCG has been re-
sponsible for community outreach and has
received funding from the Health Resources
and Services Administration that has al-
lowed senior dental students to provide oral
health services at more than 25 different
clinical sites in underserved areas of the
State of Georgia, including clinics in Al-
bany, the greater Atlanta area, Augusta, Co-
lumbus, Dalton, Gainesville, Greensboro,
Jonesboro, Rochelle, Savannah, and Waynes-
boro: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes—
(1) the 50th anniversary of The Dental Col-
lege of Georgia and its distinguished alumni;
and
(2) the contributions of The Dental College
of Georgia to educating the dentists of the
State of Georgia.

HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOV-
ERNMENTAL AFFAIRS
Mr. MCCONNELL (for himself and
Mr. SCHUMER) submitted the following
resolution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 139
Whereas, the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations of the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Affairs con-
ducted an investigation into the Equifax
data breach;
Whereas, the Subcommittee has received a
request from the Federal Trade Commission
for access to records of the Subcommittee’s
investigation;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of
the United States and Rule XI of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under
the control or in the possession of the Senate
can, by administrative or judicial process, be
taken from such control or possession but by
permission of the Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence
under the control or in the possession of the
Senate is needed for the promotion of jus-
tice, the Senate will take such action as will
promote the ends of justice consistent with
the privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking
Minority Member of the Permanent Sub-
committee on Investigations of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs, acting jointly, are authorized
to provide to the Federal Trade Commission
and other law enforcement officials, regu-
latory agencies, and entities or individuals
duly authorized by Federal or State govern-
ments, records of the Subcommittee’s inves-
tigation into the Equifax data breach.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
behalf of myself and the distinguished
Democratic leader, Mr. SCHUMER, I
send to the desk a resolution on docu-
mentary production by the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, and
ask for its immediate consideration.
Mr. President, the Permanent Sub-
committee on Investigations of the
Committee on Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs recently con-
ducted an investigation into the
Equifax data breach. The Sub-
committee has now received a request
from the Federal Trade Commission
seeking access to records that the Sub-
committee obtained during the inves-
tigation.
In keeping with the Senate’s practice
under its rules, this resolution would
authorize the Chairman and Ranking
Minority Member of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, act-
ing jointly, to provide records, ob-
tained by the Subcommittee in the
course of its investigation, in response
to this request and requests from other
Federal or State government entities

f
THE ECONOMY
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last
week the dedicated journalists at the
Cincinnati Enquirer published the first
in a series of reports on the Ohioans
left behind by the economic recovery.
This is a big project that seven report-
ers, three editors, photographers, and
videographers are all working on. They
are doing what reporters do best—
going behind the headlines about stock
market performance and actually talk-
ing to people from all walks of life in
southwest Ohio, in their circulation
area.
When you look beyond the numbers,
you see a pretty different story from
what this President and his Wall Street
Cabinet like to brag about. These re-
porters traveled the 80-mile road that
stretches from Middletown to Cin-
cinnati and beyond. They talked to
teachers and factory workers. They
talked to pastors and truckdrivers,
people of all ages, and people of all
races. Over and over they found the
same things. These Ohioans have sim-
ply not recovered from the Wall Street
recession of a decade ago. They haven’t
recovered from decades of trade and
tax policies that funneled wealth to the
richest CEOs and the biggest multi-
national corporations.
These reporters wrote:
[These workers] may find jobs, but they
don’t earn the salaries and benefits they
once did. They may pay their bills on time,
but they’re one illness or broken-down car
from financial crisis.
Their savings accounts are stretched.
Their health and retirement benefits inad-
equate. They need more than they have.
In other words, their hard work isn’t
paying off. Listen to some of the sto-
ries these reporters tell. They talked to
a subcontractor for AK Steel. His em-
ployer is renegotiating its contract
with the factory.
The authors wrote:
If the contract vanishes, someone will still
do the work he does, but that’s about the
only thing he knows for sure. A new com-
pany might fire everyone and hire new driv-
ers or decide to cut his pay.
More and more companies use sub-
contractors and independent contrac-
tors as a way to—as they always put
it—‘‘cut labor costs.’’ What they really
mean is to pay people less.
Listen to the story of a Mexican im-
migrant in West Chester Township in
Butler County. He is here legally. He
has a work permit. He works 60 hours a
week to support his family. Do you
know what he told reporters?
It’s real tight with four kids. . . . I’m not
here to take anybody else’s jobs or money or
benefits. . . . I’m here to work.
Another woman, a cancer survivor,
talked to reporters about her crippling
medical debt. She had to leave her job
because of her condition, and she owes
thousands of dollars because of her
cancer treatment.
They wrote that ‘‘the debt took her
car first, then her home of 12 years.’’
Think about that. The debt took her
car first because she got sick and be-
cause we don’t protect people with pre-
existing conditions because of the
President’s comments and antics and
all. They took her car first, and then
they took her home of 12 years.
Listen to a story of a man in Middle-
town. He is trying to get a job, but he
can’t yet afford a computer or a car. He
is applying for a job in an auto parts
plant. He has to fill out forms online,
and he has to have a drug test. That
means trying to figure out how to get
to a job counseling center to use a
computer. It means trying to get a
friend to drive him another 7 miles to
the drug testing center.
The competition for a decent-paying
job like that is so stiff that he is afraid

if he doesn’t get the application in very
soon, the job will be gone.
Think about the many layers of these
stories. The reporting makes clear, as
they say, that these are not outliers.
These are not unusual cases. ‘‘House-
hold income is lower today than before
the recession in almost half the coun-
ties in Greater Cincinnati.’’
Greater Cincinnati is partly in Ken-
tucky, represented by Senator MCCON-
NELL and Senator PAUL, partly in Indi-
ana, represented by Senator YOUNG and
our new colleague from Indiana, and
much in Ohio, represented by Senator
PORTMAN and me.
Poverty is worse in one-third of those
counties.
Wages for the poorest workers have barely
budged since the recovery began.
And we know it isn’t just southwest
Ohio. It is the whole State. It is the
whole country. It is the same story we
see repeated over and over and over in
this country. Wall Street recovers, cor-
porations recover, and the wealthiest
CEOs recover and then some. They all
do better than ever.
Corporations spent more than $800
billion with a ‘‘b’’—800,000 million—in
stock buybacks last year.
Remember the President’s tax bill? I
heard him say in his Cabinet Room,
every American would get at least a
$4,000 raise. Some Americans would get
a $9,000 raise. He told a group of Sen-
ators face-to-face. There would be
many more good-paying jobs created.
He went to Youngstown, OH, only 1
year ago and said: Don’t sell your
homes. Stay here. The jobs are going to
come back. We are going to build new
factories. We are going to repopulate
these factories.
Well, on his watch, three shifts of
1,500 people each at Lordstown—a GM
plant—and Youngstown have been laid
off, it appears, permanently.
The President’s tax bill? That money
didn’t end up in the pockets of the
company’s workers. Stock buybacks go
straight to the pockets of CEOs and
other corporate managers who make
the decisions about what to do with
corporate stock buybacks.
So do you remember I said $800 bil-
lion in stock buybacks last year? For
the first time in a decade, corporations
spent more on buying back their own
stock, meaning taking the money and
putting it in their pockets. They spent
more money buying back their own
stock then they did in long-term cap-
ital expenditures and investing in their
workers’ pay. They took more money
for themselves—as if the President
didn’t know that of his tax cut, be-
tween 70 percent and 80 percent went to
the richest 1-percent of the people in
the country over time. He knew that. I
think he knew that.
He also knew that in this tax bill
there was a 50-percent-off coupon. If
you produce in the United States, you
pay a 21-percent corporate tax rate. If
you move to Mexico you pay a 10.5-per-
cent corporate tax rate. So what the
President did and what the Senate did
is to give a 50-percent-off coupon as a
reward for shutting down your produc-
tion in Lordstown, OH, and moving to
Mexico.
Corporations spent more on their
stock than investing in long-term cap-
ital expenditures and workers, but or-
dinary Americans—what happened to
the people in this story?
As for this story that the Cincinnati
Enquirer wrote about and all of the
people they interviewed—White, Black,
Latino, Asian American, young and
old, middle class and people falling out
of the middle class, and low-income
people who work hard and aspire to the
middle class—what happened to them?
They got left behind.
We need to change how we think
about our economy. It is time for peo-
ple in this Congress and in the White
House to stop measuring the economy
in quarterly earnings reports and stock
prices.
Who thinks that way? People don’t
structure their lives thinking about
quarterly financial reports. They don’t
structure their lives thinking of stock
prices. People don’t think in terms of
3-month earnings quarters. They think
in terms of school years. They think in
terms of 30-year mortgages. They think
in terms of ‘‘the number of years left
that I have to work before my retire-
ment, and am I going to have enough?’’
That is the way that people think, but
that is who we are here to serve, in
South Dakota, Ohio, or anywhere else.
We are here to serve workers and here
to serve families. We are not here on
the Senate Banking Committee to
serve Wall Street. We are not here on
the Senate Finance Committee or on
the floor of the Senate to serve the big-
gest companies in the country that
typically reward us by moving jobs
overseas.
We need policies that restructure our
economy to recognize that all work has
dignity. When work has dignity, every-
one can afford healthcare and everyone
can afford housing. They have power
over their schedules. They have the
economic security to start a family, to
pay for daycare or college or both, to
take time off to care for themselves or
their families when they are sick, and
they save for their retirement.
The dignity of work fundamentally is
about wages. It is about benefits. It is
about having power over your own
schedule. It is about daycare. It is
about saving for retirement. It is about
being able to take off to care for a
loved one, whether you are raising chil-
dren or taking care of an aging parent.
When work has dignity, our country
has a strong middle class and a pros-
perous future.
f
PLANNED PARENTHOOD
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last
month, the courts once again stepped
in and allowed politicians to meddle in
women’s healthcare. Last month the
courts once again stepped in. Unelected
judges—unelected, conservative, most-
ly male judges—stepped in and allowed
politicians to meddle in women’s
healthcare. These unelected judges
ruled that Ohio can defund Planned
Parenthood, limiting healthcare op-
tions for tens of thousands of Ohioans.
Planned Parenthood centers just in
my State alone provide 70,000 free STD
and HIV tests, cancer screenings, do-
mestic violence education, and pre-
natal care. These clinics—and I have
been to a number of them—are often
the only places that many women and
some men have to turn. Think again
about the services they provide. They
provide STD and HIV tests. They pro-
vide cancer screenings. They provide
prenatal care. They provide domestic
violence education.
What happens if they can’t go to
Planned Parenthood because of a polit-
ical movement? Because of the politi-
cizing of women’s health, we see elect-
ed officials in Ohio taking away that
care. They can’t afford care somewhere
else or they live too far away from
other healthcare providers to have any
real options. They turned to Planned
Parenthood.
This decision by these judges is dev-
astating for Ohioans. I get letters all
the time from Ohioans who rely on
Planned Parenthood.
One woman in Cincinnati wrote:
[Planned Parenthood] performed several of
my yearly screenings, one of which detected
an abnormality that was taken care of early
and didn’t develop into a major problem.
Also, I was able to buy highly effective birth
control at a reasonable price and avoid hard-
er choices down the road.
Why would a legislature and a judge
want to take that away?
A woman from West Liberty, a con-
servative community in our State,
wrote:
If Planned Parenthood was not available to
me as a young woman, I would’ve had no-
where to turn.
I was comfortable with seeking the help of
the kind women and staff at Planned Parent-
hood. I was young and naive, but at least I
knew there was somewhere safe to turn to.
A Columbus woman who wrote from
the State’s largest city:
At the age of 18, I became a young new
mother. Throughout my years as a new
mom, struggling to manage financial respon-
sibilities on top of everything else, I used
Planned Parenthood for most of my OB
needs.
Planned Parenthood not only provided a
well-rounded education in which I had re-
ceived none previously—
That happens so often—
but they also provided services that I would
not have had access to otherwise.
Another woman from Cincinnati
wrote:
I am 42 years old, but when I was a young
woman in college I went to a Planned Par-
enthood clinic to receive my yearly check-
ups. It was cheap, near my college, and easy
to access.
During one of my appointments they
shared with me that they had found an irreg-
ular pap-smear and that I needed immediate
medical attention.

issue she found that may later cause issues

with having children. The doctor was amaz-
ing, supportive, and provided me the guid-
ance as a young woman of what to do to en-
sure I was safe and getting the proper next
steps.
Planned Parenthood saved my life.
The animosity coming out of the ma-
jority leader’s office, the animosity to-
ward Planned Parenthood coming from
so many of my colleagues, and so much
of the animosity coming out of the
White House toward Planned Parent-
hood just amazes me because this
woman said: ‘‘Planned Parenthood
saved my life.’’
Think about that.
It is time for old White men in Wash-
ington and in courtrooms—and that is
usually who they are. They are very af-
fluent, they are generally older men
judges, they are generally White, and
they are making decisions in court-
rooms and dictating decisions that
should be made between a woman and
her doctor.
That is what this is. This, along with
heartbeat bills and all the other bills
making their way through the State
legislature in my State of Ohio and
around the country—they spread lies.
They spread disinformation. They are
all about the same thing—intimidating
women, intimidating doctors, and mak-
ing it harder for women to get com-
prehensive healthcare. It is immoral,
and it is despicable. I join so many of
my colleagues in pledging never to stop
fighting to protect women’s freedom to
make their own healthcare decisions.
I yield the floor.

f
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
am here for my usual climate speech.
The Presiding Officer has seen this in-
creasingly battered poster many times
before.
We have had an interesting period in
the Senate recently with respect to cli-
mate change, and I would like to take
a moment to comment on it. Before I
do that, I think it is important to kind
of frame the backdrop of what is going
on and why this matters.
This is the measurement of carbon
dioxide levels on Earth. This goes back
400,000 years—no agriculture, no wheel,
a long, long time ago. We see, over
time, this recurring pattern in which
CO2 levels stay between 180 and 300
ppm. You can go back and people can
see that these are—there are tempera-
ture shifts that correlate with these
CO2 levels.
We know this—I saw Senator BROWN
from Ohio here. We know this because
people have gone out—including two
scientists from Ohio State. They have
gone out to glaciers in the farthest and
highest reaches of the planet, and they
have drilled out cores of ice that go
back tens of hundreds of thousands of
years, and they are able to figure out,
from the characteristics of the ice of
that period, what the CO2 concentra-
tions were—that and a lot of other data
as well. This is very well scientifically
established.
It is a little bit hard to see because it
gets lost in the 0 year line, but this is
what has happened. This is the highest
level ever right there—highest historic
CO2 level. We shot up to here. We are
actually over 400 ppm, and the range
was 180 to 300. Do the math. Between
300 and 180, that is 120 ppm range, and
now we are almost, by that full range,
out of that range. That is an extraor-
dinary anomaly in the entire history of
the species—in fact, before our species.
So the idea that this has all hap-
pened before, that the climate is al-
ways changing, that is factual and sci-
entific nonsense. Anybody who says
that is either uninformed or should be
ashamed of themselves because it is
not always changing up to 400-plus
ppm. It just isn’t. We have no experi-
ence of that ever.
We do know that as these CO2 levels
go up, the planet warms. We have
known that since Abraham Lincoln
was President. When Abraham Lincoln
was riding around here in his top hat,
scientists had begun to understand
about greenhouse gases and what that
did. So there is nothing new in this.
The science is totally established, and
this is unprecedented in human history
and before.
Here is where it comes home to roost
for me. This is a map of the northern
part of my State. This is the lower tip
of our capital city, Providence. Over
here is Bristol and Warren. Here is
Warwick. This is Narragansett Bay.
This is the top of Prudence Island. Here
is the Mount Hope Bay. If you can see,
all the parts that you see here as blue,
all of that is now land. All of that is
now land.
It has people’s homes on it. It has
people’s businesses on it. It has some of
our public recreation facilities on it. It
is all predicted to disappear by the end
of this century if we don’t get our
hands around this climate change prob-
lem. We don’t have until the end of the
century to stop it because like a giant
oil tanker, you can put all engines in
reverse, you can shut off engines, it is
still going to have a lot of carry be-
cause of the momentum that has built
up. This, where we are right now, is
going to create effects for a long time.
We have way less until the end of the
century to act. The newest studies say
we have about 12 years, if we really
want to get ahead of this.
There has been some interesting stuff
said on the Senate floor recently. Tell
it to the people whose homes are going
to be gone. This isn’t just a political
debate. There are lives, there are peo-
ple’s homes, and there are people’s
businesses that are at stake.
We had a big appearance by 13 Repub-
lican Senators led by the majority
leader, and they all came to the Senate
floor to make fun of the Green New
Deal or at least the Koch brothers’
phony cartoon version of the Green
New Deal. Out of the 13, 12 mentioned
a fanciful $93 trillion cost that the
Koch brothers have come up with. So
basically the purpose was to come to
the floor, make fun of the Green New
Deal, and pretend it is going to cost $93
trillion.
Very few could even use the word
‘‘climate change.’’ Imagine that. There
were 13 Republican Senators coming to
the floor to talk about climate change,
and all they want to do is make fun of
the Green New Deal, mock it, pretend
it is going to cost $93 trillion, and then
go away as if these people’s homes
didn’t matter and as if this weren’t se-
rious to people who are looking at this.
The news report that I have just seen
on the $93 trillion says this:
When it comes to the $93 trillion estimate
for the Green New Deal, created by its crit-
ics, the answer is found in a network of
interlinked groups: a think tank, its polit-
ical arm and a super political action com-
mittee. Add a web of secret donors, and eager
lawmakers—
The 13 of them—
and you have the blurry outlines of an echo
chamber that propels an unverified claim
into the orbit of Washington politics.
I am sure that is all good fun, but
this is pretty serious, from my point of
view. It actually got worse after that.
A Senator from Utah came to the floor
with a lot of jokes about rocket
launchers, velociraptors, tauntauns,
and 20-foot seahorses carrying
Aquaman around.
By the way, if you are looking at
having your constituents’ homes dis-
appear underwater, jokes about
Aquaman are not funny, not funny at
all. Train seahorses—give me a break—
jokes about cows.
‘‘Critics,’’ he said, ‘‘will chastise me
for not taking climate change seri-
ously.’’ Well, yes, I am here to do ex-
actly that because it is darn serious to
most everybody and particularly to my
home State. So jokes about
Sharknados just—I would say this: You
might disagree with me about climate
change, and you might not want to do
anything about climate change, but, by
God, I think if there is one thing we
owe each other in this body, it is sin-
cerity, and to come to the floor with an
insincere bill that is designed to fail is
demeaning to the whole body. To come
to the floor and make jokes, when our
own national scientific agencies are
warning of these harms about all of
this, it is just fundamentally wrong.
Let me talk about the Senator’s
home State a little bit because one of
the things I have done is paid my col-
leagues the sincere compliment of
going to many of their States to look
into what is going on with climate
change. Let me review what I have said
about Utah because I went there.
What I have learned—I gave a speech
before I went in based on research that
I did. I gave another speech when I
came out based on what I heard in
Utah. Going in, I knew the average
temperature had already increased 2
full degrees Fahrenheit in parts of
Utah. The 2 degrees centigrade we are

There are significant trends in river

est drying trend in rivers and streams
in Southern Utah as the system comes
unhinged. Lake Powell in Utah, when I
was ready to leave, was about half full,
which is kind of a big deal because Salt
Lake City gets 80 percent of its water
supply from snowpack in the Uinta and
Wasatch Mountains.
Local predictions were that water
managers in Utah would no longer be
able to depend on the historic data
about snow melt and river flow because
the change is so complete that the old
data isn’t germane any longer. There
have been wildfire studies led by Dr.
Philip Dennison of the University of
Utah connecting climate change to the
wildfires that take place out there. In
fact, Utah State has entire courses of
study teaching students about climate
change—how to predict it and how to
fight back. Utah State has its own cli-
mate action plan. It has an active cli-
mate center. The University of Utah
has an active sustainability center.
Students and researchers work there to
address climate change. Each year, the
University of Utah publishes an annual
report on climate change. I am sure
that is all just so amusing to my col-
league from Utah.
Mayors are engaged in Utah, includ-
ing the mayor then of Salt Lake City.
Mayor Ralph Becker took first place in
the Mayors Climate Protection Center
rankings. I can only imagine how
amusing that was for the senior Sen-
ator from Utah to yuck it up about
that.
His ski areas—Alta, Canyons, Deer
Crest, Deer Valley, and Park City—all
signed the BICEP coalition’s Climate
Declaration in support of taking na-
tional action on climate change. I bet
that really cracked him up.
The Park City Foundation in Utah
was predicting a local temperature in-
crease of 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit by
2075, which they said would cause a
total loss of snowpack in the lower
Park City resort area. It kind of takes
the fun out of skiing when there is no
snow in Park City.
A retired pediatrician named David
Folland, who is the coleader of Salt
Lake Citizens Climate Lobby, wrote
there is an actual solution: ‘‘Placing a
fee on carbon sources and returning the
proceeds to households would create
jobs, build the economy, improve pub-
lic health, and help stabilize the cli-
mate.’’ I hope my colleague from Utah
has a chance to go talk to this retired
pediatrician and hear from him just
how amusing all of this climate change
stuff is.
Republican Presidential candidate
John Huntsman, who has served Utah
as Governor, wrote a New York Times
op-ed piece back then titled ‘‘The
G.O.P. Can’t Ignore Climate Change.’’
Well, it is getting to the point where
we are pushing them enough. They
can’t ignore it so much. Their fallback,
I guess, is to make fun of it. That is
really, really helpful.
Here is what he wrote:
The fact is that the planet is warming, and
failing to deal with this reality will leave us
vulnerable and possibly worse. Hedging
against risk—
He said—
is an enduring theme of conservative
thought.
An enduring theme of conservative
thought, up until it bumps up against
the enduring theme of Republican
fundraising from the fossil fuel indus-
try.
So then I went out there and had a
chance to meet with the folks from the
Utah ski industry. During the last sea-
son, they told me they had nearly 41⁄2
million skiers and snowboarders and
that almost 1 in 10 jobs in Utah is in
tourism. They market themselves as
having what they call the Greatest
Snow on Earth, and they pointed out
that according to the EPA, average
temperatures had already risen 2 full
degrees Fahrenheit there over the past
100 years.
I visited with Ski Utah and with a
group of professional skiers from the
group, Protect Our Winters, who want
to see the mountaintops and the ski
slopes that give them their recreation
and give them their living, in many
cases, protected and saved. The sci-
entists at the University of Utah, in-
cluding meteorologists Leigh Sturges
and John Horel, were predicting that
there would be more rain and less snow
at major Utah ski resorts under dif-
ferent climate change scenarios. Rain
at a ski resort is not a good thing, and
with this many jobs in Utah, you would
think somebody from the Utah Senate
delegation might be willing to take
this seriously and work in good faith
toward a solution.
Ski Utah’s 14 resorts would certainly
like that. They got together and sent a
letter last year to the Governor of
Utah asking the State to take action
on climate change. Salt Lake City’s
letter went out too. Salt Lake City’s
drinking water, 70 percent comes from
snowpack melt. When the snowpack
goes away, so does that captured sup-
ply of water serving the city.
The State, when I was there, was ex-
periencing abnormally dry conditions.
I went out to the Great Salt Lake
Shorelands Preserve that was run by
The Nature Conservancy. You go out
there, and you walk on boards over the
marsh because, you know, it is marsh.
It is wet. It is spongy. It is hard to
walk through. Not then. It was dry as
a bone. We were walking over it, but
there was absolutely dry soil under-
neath.
The Salt Lake itself has shrunk. The
lake’s volume has fallen by nearly half
since Utah’s early pioneers reached its
shores in 1847. The lake’s surface is
down 11 feet. That has left roughly half
of the former lake bed dry and exposed.
The Salt Lake, for which Salt Lake
City is named, is drying up. I guess
that is another reason for a lot of
yucks here on the Senate floor from
the senior Senator from Utah.
There is a bird—I know here in Mam-
moth Hall, where we care mostly about
big interests and big money, it may
seem ridiculous to talk about a bird.
There is a bird called Wilson’s phala-
rope. It flies a 3,000-mile migration
from the Patagonian lowlands up to
the Great Salt Lake. As the Great Salt
Lake shrinks, it is going to find that it
doesn’t have a destination. It is going
to be a little like the red knot flying
from Brazil straight through to Dela-
ware. Imagine how long taking an air-
plane flight from Brazil to Delaware
would be. Now imagine you are a bird
that is about this high, and you have to
fly all that way yourself in a straight
shot. They do that. Here is this won-
derful Wilson’s phalarope, and its lake
is drying up.
All that dust from the dried-up lake
bed is now a contaminant, compro-
mising air quality in Salt Lake City,
which now gets an ‘‘F’’ from the Amer-
ican Lung Association for both ozone
and particulates. The Salt Lake City
mayor then was Jackie Biskupski. She
had pledged to transition the city to
100 percent renewable energy sources
by 2032.
I will tell you, I met with scientists
from Brigham Young, Utah State, and
the University of Utah, and there was
no doubt about climate change. There
was nobody yucking it up about cli-
mate change. There were no jokes
about tauntauns and Aquaman. This is
something they take very seriously. It
is entitled to be taken very seriously.
I will close by referring to some of
the comments I found over the week-
end from members and in some cases
leaders of the Mormon Church, the
Church of Latter-day Saints. Here is
the official statement by Mormon
Women for Ethical Government on En-
vironmental Stewardship and Climate
Change:
The consequences of maintaining the sta-
tus quo of carbon emissions and the result-
ing rate of global temperature change are
dire and include major shifts in patterns of
weather, fire, and hydrology; large-scale im-
pacts on biodiversity; and disruption to
human systems, including agriculture and
food supplies, migration, national security,
and economies. . . . We urge governments,
institutions, and businesses to boldly mobi-
lize in pursuit of creative and radical strate-
gies that will effectively curb climate
change and dramatically reduce carbon
emissions.
I urge the Senator from Utah to read
that and to listen to those constitu-
ents.
G. Michael Alder wrote—I guess in
the Ensign on an LDS Church website—
‘‘about the environmental damage
caused by such man-made problems as
acid rain, excessive carbon dioxide and
other chemicals in the atmosphere, de-
forestation, and the pollution of our
oceans, lakes, and streams,’’ saying
that ‘‘as a result, serious, mostly unin-
tended changes are taking place in the

air, water, and land around us. . . . The
evidence is mounting that we are doing
ourselves and our mortal home serious
damage. . . . A continued increase in
carbon dioxide and other gases in the
atmosphere, produced by our vast con-
sumption of oil, coal, and other fossil
fuels, appears to be responsible for a
general increase in temperature world-
wide. . . . That increase threatens pos-
sible major changes in climate around
the world, potentially causing drought
in some areas and greater rainfall in
others. . . . The studies showed that
the greatest global temperature in-
crease has taken place in the last dec-
ade. Carbon dioxide and trace gases
produced by our industrial societies
were considered to be the cause.’’
Well, they are. In fact, they are
unanimously considered to be the
cause by the responsible science com-
munity.
The last thing I will read is an ad-
dress given by Elder Steven E. Snow of
the Seventy of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints during a
panel discussion that occurred Wednes-
day October 10, 2018, at Utah State Uni-
versity.
He begins by agreeing with his moun-
tain fellow Utahans about Utah’s fresh
powder snow, calling it, again, the
‘‘greatest snow on earth,’’ at least ac-
cording to Utah’s license plates.
He goes on to say:
It causes me much grief when I look out-
side my window and see a hazy inversion or
when I hear consistent reports of Utah’s poor
air quality. I am concerned for the families
affected by wildfires and for the school-
children forced to stay indoors because of
smoky skies.
No jokes. He is concerned.
He goes on:
Algal blooms are breaking out in Utah’s
lakes. We are experiencing unusually dry
seasons and record-breaking warm winters.
He cites another church leader,
President Dallin Oaks, and quotes him:
These are challenging times, filled with big
worries: wars and rumors of wars, possible
epidemics of infectious diseases, droughts,
floods, and global warming.
He goes on to say, quoting a com-
mentary on MormonNewsroom.org,
that ‘‘the creation groans under the
weight of recklessness and indul-
gence.’’
Here is the sentence that stuck with
me: ‘‘Climate change is real, and it’s
our responsibility as stewards to do
what we can to limit the damage done
to God’s creation.’’
Making jokes about that will not
limit the damage we are now doing to
God’s creation.
I yield the floor.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF
KIMBERLY HAMM
HON. NANCY PELOSI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, together,
Leader MCCARTHY and I would like to take this
opportunity to recognize Kimberly Hamm, who
is departing the House to become a Senior
Policy Advisor to the Chairman of the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission.
Ms. Hamm has served with great integrity
and effectiveness in the House’s Office of
General Counsel for more than four years, as
an Assistant and an Associate General Coun-
sel. During her tenure, Ms. Hamm played a
critical role in safeguarding the legal interests
of the House of Representatives, its Members,
Officers and employees, particularly in con-
nection with federal court litigation involving
issues of the highest institutional importance.
Specifically, Ms. Hamm provided invaluable
legal counsel and representation to many of
the Committees of the House, greatly assisting
them in fulfilling their constitutionally-author-
ized oversight roles, protecting confidential
committee communications with the Executive
Branch from disclosure, and defending the
House’s oversight and investigative preroga-
tives when challenged in litigation.
In addition, Ms. Hamm provided frequent
and vital legal advice to the institutional offices
of the House, assisting with the development
and implementation of numerous internal pro-
cedures, improving mechanisms for executing
legal requirements and defending long-stand-
ing institutional norms, including the right of
the House to open each legislative day with a
prayer.
Ms. Hamm’s work on behalf of the House
has been of the highest caliber and I am con-
fident that the Chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission will benefit from her
exceptional policy knowledge and legal coun-
sel. On behalf of the entire House community,
Leader MCCARTHY and I thank Ms. Hamm for
her dedicated service, and wish for her the
very best in all her future endeavors.

OATH CEREMONY ON APRIL 5, 2019
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pleasure and sincerity that I take this
time to congratulate thirty individuals who will
take their oaths of citizenship on April 5, 2019.
This memorable occasion will be held at the
United States Courthouse and Federal Build-
ing in Hammond, Indiana.
America is a country founded by immi-
grants. From its beginning, settlers have come
from countries around the world to the United
States in search of better lives for their fami-
lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example
of what is so great about the United States of
America—that people from all over the world
can come together and unite as members of
a free, democratic nation. These individuals
realize that nowhere else in the world offers a
better opportunity for success than here in
America.
On April 5, 2019, the following people, rep-
resenting many nations throughout the world,
will take their oaths of citizenship in Ham-
mond, Indiana: Yankho E. Pfledderer, Anas
Bassam Kalam, Dalbag Singh Bajwa, Adriana
Rivera, Josh Jesus Ortega, Luz C. Marquez,
Zora Ristevska, Janette Magallanes, Maritza
Zapata, Gonzalo Diaz, Julia A. Martinez,
Araceli G. Campos, Bert Veenendaal, Yadviga
Tischenko, Zoran Avramoski, Neha J. Patel,
Irma Yolanda Duarte, Juan Carlos Amaya, Au-
drey Corinne Kaucoud Behinan, Miguel A. Ri-
vera, Nathalia Conte Silvestre Casiano,
Bojana Pavic, Victor Alvarez, Angelica Maria
Avila, Enrique Vargas, Sonal B. Patel, Luis
Enrique Hernandez, Sofia Sanchez, Alicia
Prado, and Lourdes Maria Fry.
Although each individual has sought to be-
come a citizen of the United States for his or
her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-
tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives,
each is inspired by the fact that the United
States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-
scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by the
people, and for the people.’’ They realize that
the United States is truly a free nation. By
seeking American citizenship, they have made
the decision that they want to live in a place
where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment
of the Constitution, they can practice religion
as they choose, speak their minds without fear
of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-
test should they choose to do so.
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask you and
my other distinguished colleagues to join me
in congratulating these individuals who will be-
come citizens of the United States of America
on April 5, 2019. They, too, are American citi-
zens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a
free and democratic nation, congratulate them
and welcome them.

cation and character in all of his future

E386 April 2, 2019
ADDRESSING THE SITUATION IN
KAZAKHSTAN CONCERNING
BERGEI RYSKALIYEV
HON. DUNCAN HUNTER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to express my concern with what appears to
be a politically motivated prosecution of the
former governor of Kazakhstan’s western
Atyrau region, Bergei Ryskaliyev, as well as
22 other people, including Ryskaliyev’s family
members and colleagues from the western oil-
producing region of the country. This sham
trial appears to be the next step in the Kazakh
regime’s efforts to silence legitimate calls of
local citizens demanding oil revenue trans-
parency, safe working conditions, and fair pay.
Just not long ago, in the country’s western oil-
producing city of Zhanaozen, a peaceful dem-
onstration was crushed by Kazakh police, who
opened fire on the protestors, resulting in at
least 16 people killed.
The fact that Kazakhstan has a long history
of discrediting and even criminally prosecuting
members of the ruling elite when they are per-
ceived to be gaining too much power and
prominence, which was the case with Mr.
Ryskaliyev during his time in office, points to
the possibility of political motivation behind the
prosecution. Additionally, independent NGOs
and western legal experts who observed the
trial point out that there has not been sufficient
evidence to justify the prejudicial findings re-
garding Mr. Ryskaliyev, essentially denying
him a fundamental human right to a fair trial.
The U.S. State Department Human Rights Re-
ports for 2018 corroborates that there is no
such thing as judicial independence in
Kazakhstan and corruption is evident at every
stage of the judicial process.
As Kazakhstan is aspiring to be a strategic
partner of the United States, I call on my col-
leagues to join me in urging the State Depart-
ment to review the case of Mr. Ryskaliyev and
assure that it will be included in our Govern-
ment’s discussions on promoting democracy in
this important part of the world.
In light of the resignation of President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, the issue of peaceful
transition of power with participation of opposi-
tion politicians and people previously con-
victed on politically motivated charges is ex-
tremely important.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FAIR PAY
ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today is
Equal Pay Day, which marks the number of
additional days a woman must work to earn
what a man earned the prior year. The 1963
Equal Pay Act (EPA), the first of the great civil
rights statutes of the 1960s, has grown creaky
with age and needs updating to reflect the
new workforce, in which women work almost
as much as men.
The best case for a stronger and updated
EPA occurred here in the Congress in 2003,
when female custodians in the House and
Senate won an EPA case after showing that
female workers were paid a dollar less per
hour for doing the same or similar work as
males. Had these women not been rep-
resented by their union, they would have had
an almost impossible task in using the rules
for bringing and sustaining an EPA class ac-
tion lawsuit.
Based on my own experience as the first
woman to chair the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, I again introduce the
Fair Pay Act (FPA) on behalf of the average
female worker, who is often first steered to,
and then locked into, jobs with wages that are
deeply influenced by the gender of individuals
who have traditionally held such jobs. Much of
the wage inequality women experience today
is because of employer-steering and deeply
rooted wage stereotypes, which result in
wages paid according to gender and not ac-
cording to the skill necessary to do the job. I
introduce the FPA because the pay disparity
most women face today stems mainly from the
segregation of women and men in different
jobs and paying women in female-dominated
jobs systematically less. Two-thirds of white
women and three quarters of African-American
women work in just three areas: sales/clerical,
service and factories. We need more aggres-
sive strategies to break through the societal
barriers present throughout history the world
over, as well as employer-steering based on
gender, which is as old as paid employment
itself.
The FPA requires that if men and women
are doing comparable work, they are to be
paid comparable wages. If a woman, for ex-
ample, is an emergency services operator, a
female-dominated profession, she should not
be paid less than a fire dispatcher, a male-
dominated profession, simply because each of
these jobs has been dominated by one sex. If
a woman is a social worker, a traditionally fe-
male occupation, she should not earn less
than a probation officer, a traditionally male
job, simply because of the gender associated
with each of these jobs.
The FPA, like the EPA, will not tamper with
the legal burden. Under the FPA, as under the
EPA, the burden will be on the plaintiff to
prove discrimination. The plaintiff must show
that the reason for the disparate treatment is
gender discrimination, not legitimate market
factors.
Remedies to achieve comparable pay for
men and women are not radical or unprece-
dented. State governments, in red and blue
states alike, have shown that it is possible to
eliminate the part of the pay gap that is due
to discrimination. Twenty state governments
have adjusted wages for female-dominated
professions, raising pay for teachers, nurses,
clerical workers, librarians, and other female-
dominated jobs that paid less than comparable
male-dominated jobs. Minnesota, for example,
implemented a pay equity plan when it found
that traditionally female jobs paid 20 percent
less than comparable traditionally male jobs.
There may well be some portion of a gender
wage gap that is traceable to market factors,
but 20 states have shown that you can tackle
the gender discrimination-based wage gap
without interfering in the market system.
States generally have closed the wage gap
over a period of four to five years at a one-
time cost of no more than three to four per-
cent of payroll.
In addition, many female workers routinely
achieve pay equity through collective bar-
gaining, and countless employers provide it on
their own as they see women shifting out of
vital female-dominated occupations as a result
of the shortage of skilled workers, as well as
because of the unfairness to women. Unequal
pay has been built into the way women have
been treated since Adam and Eve. To dis-
lodge such deep-seated and pervasive treat-
ment, we must go to the source, the tradition-
ally female occupations, where pay is linked
with gender and always has been.

CELEBRATING KATHLEEN M.
WILSON’S 100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. AYANNA PRESSLEY
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Mrs. Kathleen M. Wilson and
wish her a happy 100th birthday. Mrs. Wilson,
a longtime resident of Boston and
Massachusetts’s 7th District, is known for her
youthful spirit, her volunteerism, her sense of
humor, uncontrollable laugh and her love of
dance.
Mrs. Wilson has spent over four decades as
a public servant and a strong member of our
community. She stood as the pinnacle of
equality, working tirelessly with several women
from Roxbury to fight segregation in the Bos-
ton Public Schools and demand a quality edu-
cation for children in Boston’s black commu-
nity. Kay, the nickname given to her by her
late husband and love of her life, regularly
boarded helicopters and small service planes
to deliver pay and supplies to workers in dev-
astated areas after joining the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency (FEMA) in her re-
tirement.
Mrs. Wilson is a mother of two, grandmother
of three, great-grandmother of three, and be-
loved by all of them. She remains active with
the Goldenaires, The Urban League Guild,
AARP of Boston, Seniors on the Move and
The Swingers at 12th Baptist Church. No mat-
ter who Mrs. Wilson meets, they do not be-
lieve that she is 100 years young.

Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce the Donate for Disaster Re-
lief Act.
Last year, there were 53 major disasters de-
clared. The year before that, we had 61 de-
clared major disasters. As we continue to feel
the effects of climate change, there are going
to be more major disasters and we as a nation
are going to have to pay for the response and
repair after these events. Now is the time to
start thinking about what we can do to be bet-
ter prepared for when these disasters strike.
That is why I am introducing the Donate for
Disaster Relief Act, which creates a com-
pletely voluntary check-off on income tax re-
turns that lets taxpayers elect to donate to a
disaster relief trust. This bill is an opportunity
for us to share our selflessness and gen-
erosity and be better prepared to adequately
fund our response to an emergency situation.
The harsh reality of disasters is that while
we may not be able to predict when or where
they will always occur, we certainly can be
prepared. The altruism of the American people
is on display in their willingness to pitch in and
help those in their greatest time of need. This
bill creates an easy way for concerned Ameri-
cans to anticipate the need for disaster relief,
wherever and whenever it may be necessary.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this critically important legislation.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHAIRMAN
ALLEN E. LAWSON OF THE SAN
PASQUAL BAND OF MISSION IN-
DIANS
HON. DUNCAN HUNTER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition and honor of Chairman Allen E.
Lawson of the San Pasqual Band of Mission
Indians. Chairman Lawson has served for 22
years in a leadership position for the Tribe,
headquartered in the Valley Center area of
California’s 50th Congressional District, and
retired from his chairmanship on January 13,
2019. During his tenure, Chairman Lawson
was firmly focused on Tribal welfare and in-
creased prosperity for all members of the
Tribe.
Under his leadership, San Pasqual’s Tribal
government grew from three employees to
over 100 employees, resulting in significant in-
creases in services to over 400 Tribal families
living on the reservation. Chairman Lawson’s
leadership was instrumental with the establish-
ment of Valley View Casino, a business that
continues to thrive, generating revenue for the
entire Tribe and benefitted the reservation by
creating new Tribal Fire and Police Depart-
ments that were dedicated to ensuring the
safety of all Tribal residents. Chairman
Lawson also established one of the few fully
accredited Native American Fire Academies
and, over the last 10 years, the academy has
proudly trained over 1,000 first responders
that help protect both the reservation and the
surrounding community. Chairman Lawson
successfully expanded the Tribal Education
Center, resulting in increased high school
graduation rates, more graduates headed to
colleges, and the preservation of the Tribe’s
history, traditions and culture.
During his tenure, the Tribal Public Works,
Water, and Environmental Departments were
also established, and, after decades of nego-
tiations with four other Native American tribes,
Chairman Lawson was an integral part of the
negotiation that finally settled and secured the
entitled rights to the San Luis Rey watershed.
Chairman Lawson was also instrumental in
launching an Inter-Tribal Alliance in which
Tribes and Federal agencies would partner
collaboratively on construction projects thereby
reducing costs, maximizing resources and pro-
viding jobs to Native Americans.
It is for these accomplishments and many
more that Chairman Lawson should be recog-
nized. The legacy of any leader is the impact
and significant contributions they have made
to greatly influence the lives of those around
them. Chairman Lawson’s guiding principle
and singular focus has been the past, current,
and future generations of the San Pasqual
Band of Mission Indians and I am confident
that his legacy will never be forgotten and al-
ways appreciated.

COMMENDING DON GRIMSLEY FOR
HIS IMPACT ON HALL COUNTY’S
YOUTH COMMUNITY
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Don Grimsley for the
incredible impact he has made in Hall County.
Over the last decade, Mr. Grimsley has given
countless hours to many youth organizations,
and last month, he was recognized for his
service as the Gainesville Kiwanis Club hon-
ored him with the 2019 John W. Jacobs Jr.
Youth Service Award.
Mr. Grimsley first experienced his call to
service when his son was born with spina
bifida. With inspiration from his daughter, they
launched Rolling Hearts, a charity for individ-
uals with spina bifida that raises money for the
neuroscience department at Children’s
Healthcare of Atlanta, among other things. Mr.
Grimsley and his wife also sat on the board of
the Spina Bifida Association of Georgia, help-
ing educate the community and working to
give children with spina bifida a great and nor-
mal life. In addition to helping children with
spina bifida, Mr. Grimsley also serves as
Eagle Scoutmaster, statistician for North Hall
Middle School’s basketball team, and the
Watch D.O.G.S. program, which increases the
presence of male role models in schools.
Mr. Grimsley’s service to this community is
especially near and dear to my heart as my
daughter, Jordan, was born with spina bifida.
I understand firsthand the importance of pro-
viding our children with a normal life, and I am
incredibly grateful for his service to such a
meaningful cause. I also know his passion for
mentoring youth and stepping in as a ’surro-
gate dad’ has made an immeasurable impact
on the lives of many young men in Georgia.
I want to congratulate Don Grimsley on re-
ceiving the John W. Jacobs Jr. Youth Service
Award, and I want to thank him for his tremen-
dous service to our community. Hall County is
a better place because of Don Grimsley.

helped thousands of our country’s veterans
and other constituents with complicated
issues.
Lindsay grew up in Springfield, Illinois, and
attended Southern Illinois University, where
she earned a bachelor’s degree in forestry.
She moved to Humboldt County in June 2002
and worked with AmeriCorps Watershed Stew-
ards from 2006 to 2008. In this role, she su-
pervised staff and AmeriCorps members, and
did demanding field work, including wading in
some of the North Coast’s most beautiful riv-
ers counting salmon carcasses to better un-
derstand the condition of our vital fish popu-
lations.
In March of 2009, Lindsay was hired as a
field representative for the former 1st congres-
sional district of California under Congressman
MIKE THOMPSON. She became a skilled case-
worker with an affinity for helping veterans.
After redistricting in 2012, I hired Lindsay in
the same role and quickly recognized her as
an asset to my team. Lindsay’s eye for detail,
her work ethic, and her dedication to helping
the people of the new 2nd congressional dis-
trict made her one of my most valuable em-
ployees. Her understanding of the issues in
the district and her connections to the commu-
nity—including sitting on boards for the Open
Door Community Health Center and Redwood
Parks Conservancy—helped me better under-
stand issues in Humboldt, Del Norte, and Trin-
ity counties. Lindsay increasingly focused on
veterans’ issues and health care, led event
planning efforts, ran my Congressional Art
Competition, and brought her extraordinary
problem-solving skills to bear on an array of
issues.
Madam Speaker, as Lindsay moves on to
Humboldt State University’s College of Profes-
sional Studies in Arcata, I hope you will join
me and my staff in wishing her the best in all
her future endeavors. We will miss her joyful
nature, her sense of duty and her deep com-
petence, and I am grateful for her work on my
constituents’ behalf.

today to recognize a matter that is very near
and dear to my heart—the marriage of my
son, William Joshua Balderson to Chelsea
Alise Gallaugher this coming Saturday, April 6,
2019.
As a parent, I know that one of life’s great-
est joys is witnessing the marriage of one of
your children, and the blending of two families
into one. As parents, we can only try to raise
our children with honor, teach them well, and
send them out into the world as respectable
adults who are prepared to face life’s chal-
lenges. Everything else—successful careers,
love, marriage, and building families of their
own—those are bonuses.
What a blessing it is for Joshua and Chel-
sea to have found each other, and to share
such love for one another. I know I don’t
speak for only myself when I say how excited
and honored we are to welcome Chelsea into
the Balderson family this weekend. I thank
Chelsea’s parents, Bill and Karen Gallaugher,
for sharing their beautiful daughter with our
family. I feel blessed to have Chelsea as my
soon-to-be daughter-in-law. I wish my wonder-
ful son, Joshua, and his bride a lifetime of
health and happiness with one another. May

today in recognition of Rebecca Tebbs Nunn,
who was crowned Ms. Super Senior Virginia.
This pageant recognizes the value and impor-
tance of senior women, exemplifying their wis-
dom, experience, and generosity.
Rebecca is not only a native from Lancaster

Kilmarnock, an author of four published nov-
els, and was a professional actress for over
20 years. Most notably, Rebecca had the privi-
lege of performing with the Helen Hayes
Reparatory Theatre on Broadway. She has
even taught drama at both the high school
and college levels.
After Rebecca was crowned Ms. Senior Vir-
ginia in 2016, she has continued to give back
to her community by performing at nursing
homes and other assisted living centers. She
has also conducted acting workshops for chil-
dren from all over the country and abroad. I
am extremely proud to say that Rebecca is
the first Virginian to receive the Ms. Super
Senior award.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in

REMEMBERING ARLENE HOWARD
HON. PETER T. KING
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I
rise to honor the life of a great American and
true New Yorker, Arlene Howard, who passed
away over the weekend at the age of 95. Mrs.
Howard was World War II Navy Veteran who
raised a family committed to serving the
United States of America.
While I had met Mrs. Howard several times
prior, my relationship with her started after the
national tragedy of 9/11. Her son George, an
off-duty officer with the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey Police Department,
raced from his Hicksville home to the World
Trade Center and met death. In the days that
followed, the story of George’s bravery cap-
tured the nation’s attention and Mrs. Howard
gave her son’s shield to President George W.
Bush the day he visited Ground Zero.
When President Bush addressed a Joint
Session of Congress in the weeks following
the attacks, he did so with George’s shield in
hand. The shield remained with the President
throughout his presidency.
In the years following, Mrs. Howard grew
close with my entire family, especially with my
mother. From my first meeting with her, I knew
she was stronger, tougher, and more caring
than anyone I had ever met. She was dedi-
cated to preserving the memory of her son
and never wavered in her support for Amer-
ica’s military and the Men and Women in Blue.
Her dedication to her country and family live
on with her children and grandchildren.

HONORING THE AMERICAN RED
CROSS NORTHWEST CHAPTER
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today along with my colleague, Representative
MIKE THOMPSON, to recognize the important
role of the American Red Cross Northwest
Chapter which contributed to the 2019 presi-
dential declaration of March as Red Cross
Month.
Since its founding in 1881, the American
Red Cross has become one of the nation’s
largest humanitarian organizations, providing
disaster relief, emergency volunteer training,
and support to military families across the
country. Each year the Red Cross responds to
an average of 62,000 disasters across the
country, operating emergency shelters, serving
meals and distributing relief materials to mil-
lions of disaster victims. These efforts are
largely completed by a resilient network of vol-
unteers that the organization has trained
throughout the country, who are estimated to
respond to an emergency once every eight
minutes. This scale of service and rate of re-
sponse is truly unmatched by other humani-
tarian efforts nationwide.
In the last few years, my colleague and I
have both witnessed the importance of the
American Red Cross Northwest Chapter in a
time of crisis. During the 2017 and 2018
wildfires, the Northwest Chapter operated
shelters, collected and distributed relief mate-
rials, and provided emotional and mental
health support of fire victims throughout North-
ern California. In fact, the Northwest Chapter
of the American Red Cross assisted 330 fami-
lies with 123 local disasters and assisted 98
military families with emergency assistance
this past year alone. And as recently as last
month, the Red Cross was engaged in flood
relief efforts in parts of my district that were
severely impacted by rain and flooding caused
by atmospheric rivers.
Since President Franklin D. Roosevelt first
declared March as Red Cross Month in 1943,
we have come together at this time, each
year, to celebrate the accomplishments of the
organization and raise awareness of its value
to the American people. And as natural disas-
ters continue to rise with each coming year,
the humanitarian efforts of the American Red
Cross and its many volunteers become that
much more important.
Madam Speaker, the American Red Cross
performs a critical humanitarian role through-
out our country. The success of their efforts is
largely connected to the organization’s ability
to recruit and train volunteers who can be
called to action in their local communities. The
American Red Cross Northwest Chapter has
provided invaluable assistance to our congres-
sional districts in time of highest need. There-
fore, please join my colleague and I in thank-
ing them and in helping to raise awareness for
the American Red Cross by supporting the an-
nual declaration.

TRIBUTE TO U.S. ARMY
SPECIALIST JOSEPH P. COLLETTE
HON. STEVE STIVERS
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
on behalf of the people of Ohio’s 15th Con-
gressional District to honor and commemorate
a husband, a father, a brother, a son, and a
hero. United States Army Specialist Joseph P.
Collette, of Lancaster, gave his life in the serv-
ice of our nation on March 22, 2019.
At age 29, Specialist Collette was fulfilling a
goal he had held for over a decade: to deploy
with the United States Army. As his soulmate
and wife, Caela, tells it, following the tragedy
of September 11, her husband felt the call to
serve. As his time with the 242nd Ordnance
Battalion, 71st Explosive Ordnance Disposal
Group was coming to an end, he desperately
wanted to go on deployment.
It is that level of bravery, selflessness, and
commitment for which Specialist Collette will
be remembered by both his loved ones and
community. He was a genuine, laid back,
funny young man who was beloved by many.
A man of many special talents, he loved
sharing his passion for cooking for others and
challenging his friends in paintball matches
and Pokémon battles. He loved spending time
outdoors including running, snowboarding, and
four-wheeling. But his priority in life was
spending time with his friends and family.
Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripples
created by Specialist Collette’s life and work
are far-reaching. His legacy will live on in the
memories of those who knew him and loved
him: his wife, Caela; his children; Blair and
Cody Collette; step-children Lena and Aria
Scott; his parents, Joey Collette, and Theresa
Mecionis and step-father, Jim Wickline; his
siblings; Anthony, Camille, and Nicholas; and
the rest of his extended family and loved
ones.
As a Brigadier General in the Ohio Army
National Guard, I have had the distinct privi-
lege to serve alongside outstanding men and
women like Specialist Collette. I can say with
absolute certainty that Lancaster, Ohio is un-
deniably a better place because of Specialist
Collette, and our nation is a safer place be-
cause of his service. I am honored to cele-
brate his legacy, and I encourage my col-
leagues in the House of Representatives to
join me in extending deepest condolences to
his family, and in honoring his supreme sac-
rifice.

exceptional Texan who has been selected to
receive the HillVets’ Foundation ‘‘Philan-
thropist of the Year Award.’’ His commitment
to veterans is second to none and he is a de-
serving recipient of this prestigious honor.
Gordon has made support for veterans cen-
tral to his personal, professional and philan-
thropic life for the past 25 years. Following his
service in the U.S. Air Force, Gordon founded
Sport Clips Haircuts and has committed his
growing company to putting veterans first.
Sport Clips currently has 45 veteran franchise
owners and offers a 20% discount to veterans
looking to join the brand. The company spon-
sors the Ageless Aviation Dreams Foundation,
which provides dream flights in Boeing
Stearman biplanes for seniors and veterans
living in long-term care facilities and has given
more than 3,500 dream flights. Gordon’s Sport
Clips also sponsors veteran-centered organi-
zations such as the Aleethia Foundation, Grat-
itude Initiative, Honor Flight Austin, R.O.C.K
veteran program and Rosie’s List in San
Diego.
In addition to being a past president and
current member of the VetFran Committee,
Gordon also serves on the VFW Foundation
Board, which directs the funds donated to the
VFW for active duty servicemembers and vet-
erans, and on the advisory board for USO Fort
Hood. The VFW’s Sport Clips Help A Hero
Scholarship program has provided some 1,300
scholarships totaling $5.5 million to service
men and women and veterans pursuing their
education and training goals. Gordon’s com-
mitment to investing his abilities to support our
veterans is a deeply held creed that speaks to
the generous activism of true and devoted
public servant.
Gordon Logan is one of our nation’s stalwart
champion for veterans. I am honored to rep-
resent him in Congress, as his efforts rep-
resents Texas values at their very best. I
proudly stand alongside those who salute his
work on behalf of our nation’s heroes.

HONORING JOSEPH ORENDAIN
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I stand today to honor the career of Joseph
Orendain. Mr. Orendain recently retired from
the Hidalgo County District Attorney’s Office,
serving with honor and prestige throughout his
tenure as an Assistant District Attorney.
Twenty-nine years ago, Mr. Orendain began
his legal career in the District Attorney’s office.
Though he easily could have left for a more
lucrative job, he continued his service to the
community for nearly three decades. He has
worked on countless noteworthy cases and
earned recognition from his peers as well as
the Association of Government Attorneys in
Capital Litigation Awards, receiving an award
for Outstanding Advocacy in Capital and Com-
plex Homicide Cases. Mr. Orendain made his-
tory when he became the first prosecutor to
successfully try a human trafficking case in the
United States using a state penal code.
Mr. Orendain’s involvement and commit-
ment to justice was ingrained in him at an
early age The child of the man who founded
the Texas Farm Workers Union, he followed
his father to strikes and marches to fight for
workers’ rights. When he was only 14-years-
old he marched in the Texas Farm Workers
March for Human Rights from the Rio Grande
Valley in Texas to Washington, D.C.
In 2017, Mr. Orendain and his trial partner,
Cregg Thompson, tried and successfully se-
cured a guilty conviction in another landmark
case. Ultimately, it took them six weeks of rig-
orous work to succeed. I am confident that Mr.
Orendain will continue to improve the lives of
many in his community and make us proud. I
wish him the best as he enjoys his well-
earned retirement with family, friends and
loved ones.
Madam Speaker, Joseph Orendain is a pil-
lar of our community, and it is truly a privilege
to represent committed, selfless individuals
like him.

HONORING ALICE PAUL TAPPER
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing Alice Paul Tapper, a District
of Columbia native, for her activism creating a
nationwide Raise Your Hand movement as a
Girl Scout Cadette in Girl Scouts Nation’s
Capital.
Alice Paul Tapper was born in Washington,
D.C. to humanitarian Jennifer Tapper and jour-
nalist Jake Tapper. She is a sixth grade stu-
dent at Maret School. Raise Your Hand is the
brainchild of Alice, who witnessed firsthand
that girls were shying away from raising their
hand in class or volunteering at school activi-
ties. She brought the issue to the attention of
her Girl Scout troop, and they agreed that Girl
Scouts should have a patch for that. Alice re-
alized this type of empowerment could only
take place in a girl-led organization.
Alice’s observations are also grounded in
research. Girls’ self-confidence drops 3.4
times below boy’s, especially between the
ages of eight and 12. Working with Girl Scouts
Nation’s Capital, the Raise Your Hand patch,
was launched. Girls earn the patch after
pledging to raise their hands more in class
and recruiting other girls to do the same. The
patch was put into circulation nationwide in
October 2017.
Today, over 12,000 girls and women from
around the globe have taken the pledge and
earned the patch. Alice has received national
attention for the Raise Your Hand movement,
including appearing on local news and being
one of the youngest persons to get an op-ed
published in the New York Times.
Alice will bring her message to young read-
ers in a children’s book, Raise Your Hand,
published by Penguin Young. The book chron-
icles Alice’s advocacy initiative for girls and
will be released March 26, 2019, after she ap-
pears on the Ellen Show on March 22nd. Alice
has donated her advance of $25,000, as well
as a matching donation from Oprah Winfrey,
to Girl Scouts Nation’s Capital, so that more
girls can grow in confidence.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing Alice
Paul Tapper for her initiative to elevate girls’
self-esteem and to encourage them to raise
their hands in the District of Columbia and
around the world.

HONORING JOHN DELL’OSSO
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of John Dell’Osso, a Na-
tional Park Service ranger who is retiring after
more than 35 years of dedicated federal serv-
ice.
Born in San Francisco, John’s family moved
to Petaluma where he would attended school.
After getting his AA degree from the Santa
Rosa Junior College in 1981, John received a
Bachelor of Science in Environmental Plan-
ning and Management from the University of
California Davis two years later.
John began his career with the National
Park Service in May of 1983 at the Point
Reyes National Seashore. Starting as a Sea-
sonal Interpretive Ranger that summer, John
worked as an Administrative Clerk and a park
ranger, eventually becoming a Supervisory
Park Ranger. In 1994, John was promoted to
Chief of Interpretation and Resource Edu-
cation for the Point Reyes National Seashore,
and later became the park Public Information
Officer, roles that he held for 25 years.
John’s leadership brought great acclaim to
the park and the National Park Service over
the years, especially in the area of universal
accessibility. Through design work on exhibit
panels, accessibility guides, audio descrip-
tions, and braille publications, John expanded
the way in which the park shares information
to the public. The park interpretation and re-
source education division has received 14 na-
tional media awards under his leadership,
which is more than any other national park
unit. During his tenure, John also worked to
expand accessibility in parks across the coun-
try, and the National Park Service recognized
him for his work on sea level rise exhibits and
messaging in 2017.
John’s dedication to public service extended
beyond his work for the National Park Service.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT
OF RAMONA THOMAS
HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the career of Ramona
Thomas and celebrate her upcoming retire-
ment on June 3, 2019. Ramona has dedicated
29 years to serving the Permian Basin.
Ramona began her tenure with Permian
Basin Community Centers, now known as
PermiaCare, as a Staff Accountant in 1990,
and almost twenty-nine years later, she will be
retiring as the Chief Executive Officer, a posi-
tion she’s held since November of 2014.
PermiaCare provides integral mental health,
intellectual and developmental disability, and
substance-abuse disorder services, and Ra-
mona’s leadership in the organization has at-
tributed to their ability to expand into the lead-
ing expert in behavioral health and develop-
ment disability services in the Permian Basin.
In addition to being an integral leader in
PermiaCare, she has also served through var-
ious capacities in numerous professional orga-
nizations. Ramona has also gone above and
beyond as an active leader in the community.
She regularly volunteers with the Rotary Club,
Leadership Midland, the Midland Behavioral
Health Leadership Team, and the United Way
of Midland.
I worked directly with Ms. Thomas during
my time on the Board of Directors for Permian
Basin Community Centers, during which time
she was the Chief Financial Officer. I found
her to execute her work precisely, and she led
her agency to be ranked consistently as one
of the best in Texas. I’ll always remember Ms.
Thomas’ personable demeanor, unquestion-
able talent, and as a joy to work with. On be-
half of the 11th District of Texas, congratula-
tions to Ramona Thomas on her retirement. I
look forward to seeing what she will accom-
plish in this next chapter.
