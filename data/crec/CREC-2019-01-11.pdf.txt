RECOGNIZING LIZ DUNBAR
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Liz Dunbar for her
many years of transformative public
service on behalf of folks in my region.
As executive director of Tacoma
Community House, Liz has been an
unyielding advocate for social justice.
Liz has lived a life of service. She spent
25 years at the Washington State De-
partment of Social and Health Serv-
ices, where she worked in several ca-
pacities, including State refugee coor-
dinator, diversity director, assistant
secretary for economic services, and,
ultimately, as the deputy secretary of
the department for 6 years.
But 10 years ago, Liz stepped into her
role at Tacoma Community House, an
extraordinary 100-year-old organization
dedicated to empowering immigrants
and ensuring that all people in the
greater Puget Sound region can live
with dignity and achieve their personal
and professional goals.
Each year, Tacoma Community
House serves approximately 3,500 cli-
ents from more than 100 different coun-
tries through its four core programs of
employment, education, immigration,
and advocacy.
Madam Speaker, Liz Dunbar has
made a difference. She has helped thou-
sands of people get the chance to real-
ize the American Dream.
So I rise today on behalf of our com-
munity to thank Liz and to recognize
her for a career well spent in public
service.
f
HONORING CHAPLAIN G. WILLIAM
BRYAN
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life, legacy, and
ministry of Chaplain G. William Bryan.
I just knew him as Chaplain Bill.
He was a fellow alum of Dallas Theo-
logical Seminary and was most widely
known as DTS’ beloved chaplain. To
many, he was a friend and encourager.
To Shirley, he was a devoted husband.
He was the father of three, grandfather
to nine, and a spiritual mentor to
many, including me and my wife, Amy
Kate.
I will never forget, when tragedy
struck my family a few decades ago,
that Chaplain Bryan was one of the
first to reach out with comforting
words, prayer, and follow-up. His role
as chaplain served thousands every
year, but when you saw him, you felt
as if you were connecting with a best
friend.
Chaplain Bill was also known to play
his trumpet with full vigor. As a stu-
dent at DTS, I avoided the front row in
chapel for fear he might actually ex-
plode during the hymn, ‘‘All Hail the
Power of Jesus’ Name.’’
Chaplain Bill, we will miss you down
here, but we look forward to joining
you in the everlasting song, with your
trumpet at full tilt, as we crown Him
Lord of all.

H468 January 11, 2019
TIME TO END THE SHUTDOWN
(Mrs. CRAIG asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, today,
air traffic controllers in a regional fa-
cility in Farmington continue to work
without pay, while support staff is fur-
loughed. Adding insult to injury, in the
last few hours, they received regularly
scheduled earnings statements that
read zero dollars and zero cents.
Earlier this week, I met with them in
Burnsville and again in Washington. I
heard their stories.
Joe, a new father with a baby born 10
weeks early still in the NICU, had his
leave canceled because of the shut-
down.
Jeremy, a father of three, may have
to take out credit card debt just to pay
the bills.
And Kelly, a trainee with student
loan debt, doesn’t know how she is
going to make ends meet.
Each of them, on behalf of commu-
nities and passengers they may never
know, remains committed.
It is time to end the shutdown and
stop playing politics with people’s
lives.
f
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING
DEPUTY U.S. MARSHAL CHASE
WHITE
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, on
November 29, 2018, Deputy U.S. Mar-
shal Chase White was senselessly killed
in the line of duty while serving a war-
rant in Tucson, Arizona.
Born and raised in Peoria, Illinois,
Chase led a life committed to serving
his community and his country. Known
as a leader amongst his peers, Chase
entered the Air Force following grad-
uation from the University of Illinois
and served Active Duty from 2000 to
2007. He was set to leave for deploy-
ment as a lieutenant colonel in the Air
Force Reserves the same week he was
tragically murdered.
A loving father of four, his mother,
Reverend Lynnda White of Peoria’s
Universalist Unitarian Church, de-
scribed him as a ‘‘hero’’ to his children
‘‘because his family was his life.’’
This week, we recognized National
Law Enforcement Appreciation. While
we take one day to celebrate the serv-
ice of those who protect our commu-
nities, it is important we never forget
the brave men and women, like Chase,
who have paid the ultimate sacrifice.
Each day, law enforcement officers
leave their families with no certainty
they will return home safe, yet they
are willing to face these risks to keep
their communities safe. I am grateful
for the courageous men and women,
like Chase, who button up their uni-
form each day, and we thank them for
protecting our families so bravely.
Madam Speaker, at this time, I
would ask for a moment of silence for
Chase White.
f
HONORING ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ MELSH
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of one of
Riverside’s finest citizens, Robert
‘‘Bob’’ Melsh.
Bob dedicated his life to community,
to activism, and to making our society
more just and equal for everyone. His
commitment to the political process
and to our democracy has been integral
to the growth and political involve-
ment in Riverside.
Through his work, he found a way to
get everyone engaged and make every-
body know their value in our democ-
racy. He encouraged people to raise
their voices and make sure elected offi-
cials listened.
Bob was an organizer. He knew what
our community cared about; he fought
for what we needed; and he was a force
to be reckoned with. For Bob, social
progress was inevitable but not with-
out effort.
I had the honor to know Bob beyond
the world of politics, and I will always
remember him recounting his story of
organizing a concert for the iconic
Louis Armstrong, otherwise known as
Satchmo, in Riverside.
Bob, I am going to really miss you.
Riverside is going to miss you.
f
CONGRATULATING COLUMBIA
GENERATING STATION
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I
rise to congratulate the workers at Co-
lumbia Generating Station for sending
over 9.7 million megawatt hours of
electricity to the Northwest power grid
last year, a new record in its 34-year
history.
Operated by Energy Northwest, the
Columbia Generating Station is the
third largest electricity generator in
Washington State and has set five new
power generation records in the last 7
years for its increased production. Its
gross megawatt capacity can power a
city the size of Seattle and is equiva-
lent to about 10 percent of electricity
generated in Washington.
Nuclear power and advanced tech-
nologies like small modular reactors
are critical for safe, reliable, and clean
baseload power generation in the
United States.
As we begin the 116th Congress and as
the Nation strives to depend more upon
carbon-free sources of energy, I will be
a steadfast advocate for the safe, clean
power we receive from nuclear energy.
Congratulations to the Energy
Northwest employees at Columbia Gen-
erating Station on a job well done. You
play a vital role for our State’s and our
Nation’s energy security and independ-
ence.
f
SHUTDOWN AFFECTING FEDERAL
WORKERS
(Ms. WEXTON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker,
today is payday for Federal workers,
but instead of receiving a paycheck,
many, including thousands of my con-
stituents, will be going without.
I had a visit from a constituent yes-
terday who is an air traffic controller
at Washington Center in Leesburg, Vir-
ginia, one of the busiest air traffic con-
trol centers in the Nation. She worked
80 hours over the past 2 weeks and re-
ceived a paycheck for zero dollars. You
can’t pay your mortgage with zero dol-
lars. You can’t buy groceries with zero
dollars. You can’t pay your medical
bills or fill up your gas tank with zero
dollars.
Madam Speaker, Federal employees
want to go back to work. They believe
in their mission and want to provide
quality services for the American peo-
ple. They shouldn’t have to sell off
their belongings or return their chil-
dren’s Christmas presents just to make
ends meet. They shouldn’t have to
wonder how they are going to survive.
Our national parks are filling up with
trash. Many TSA security screeners
can’t afford to commute to work. The
FDA is not inspecting our food supply.
Our hardworking Federal employees
are doing their jobs. It is time for
President Trump and Senator MCCON-
NELL to do theirs.
f
FUND THE GOVERNMENT
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam
Speaker, it is with a great sense of
honor that I stand before you to deliver
my first address on the floor of the peo-
ple’s House.
As legislators, one of our funda-
mental duties is to fully fund the gov-
ernment and to do it on time. But
there are Federal employees, such as
the brave corrections officers working
at FCI Loretto, people whom, as their
doctor, I have treated. These people
continue to go without pay.
These hardworking men and women
do not deserve this shutdown. No
American does.
We are in this situation because
Democrats refuse to compromise and
fund the border wall, even though
many of them have voted to do so in
the past.
Today, I offer a question to my col-
leagues across the aisle: What changed?
Are you really willing to reverse a pre-
vious position and keep government
closed just so you can resist the Presi-
dent’s agenda?

January 11, 2019

AG/LAB SHUTDOWN
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the outstanding
work at the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture’s research lab in Peoria, Illi-
nois.
For more than 75 years, the Ag Lab
has conducted breakthrough research,
impacting lives of people all over the
world.
Decades after discovering how to
mass-produce penicillin, the Ag Lab
just found out how to enhance its effec-
tiveness in people who have developed
antibiotic resistance. They have also
developed an all-natural bug repellent
that is more effective than DEET.
Unfortunately, the 200 employees at
the Ag Lab have been sent home due to
this government shutdown, putting
their groundbreaking research at a
dead halt.
It is time to stop using workers as
pawns in this government shutdown.
We must put this shutdown to an end
so the Ag Lab can continue its ad-
vanced research that drives American
agriculture and our economy.
f
MINERAL RIGHTS TO ENSURE PRI-
VATE PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ANF
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, last week, I intro-
duced a bill that protects private prop-
erty rights in Pennsylvania’s only na-
tional forest, the Allegheny National
Forest. H.R. 245, the Cooperative Man-
agement of Mineral Rights Act of 2019,
will ensure that private property own-
ers and energy producers in the Alle-
gheny National Forest have access to
the property.
Despite being successfully and suffi-
ciently regulated by the Common-
wealth for decades, a Federal law
passed in 1992 required the Forest Serv-
ice to write new regulations on oil and
gas production in the ANF. However,
Federal courts have repeatedly ruled
that the Forest Service does not have
the authority to do so because the min-
erals in the ANF are privately owned.
My bill corrects this Federal law by
repealing the improper 1992 require-
ment. In fact, the House of Representa-
tives previously passed my legislation,
twice, with strong bipartisan support,
overwhelmingly in 2016 and unani-
mously in 2017.
I hope we can get this commonsense
legislation across the finish line during
the 116th Congress. I urge my col-
leagues to cosponsor this important
legislation to put the brakes on exces-
sive litigation in the ANF and protect
private property rights.

STATES, TERRITORIES, POSSESSIONS AND OTHER
FEDERAL GRANTEES IMPACTED BY A GOVERN-
MENT SHUTDOWN
SEC. 438. (a) If a State (or another Federal
grantee) used State funds (or the grantee’s
non-Federal funds) to continue carrying out
a Federal program or furloughed State em-
ployees (or the grantee’s employees) whose
compensation is advanced or reimbursed in
whole or in part by the Federal Govern-
ment—
(1) such furloughed employees shall be
compensated at their standard rate of com-
pensation for such period;
(2) the State (or such other grantee) shall
be reimbursed for expenses that would have
been paid by the Federal Government during
such period had appropriations been avail-
able, including the cost of compensating
such furloughed employees, together with in-
terest thereon calculated under section
6503(d) of title 31, United States Code; and
(3) the State (or such other grantee) may
use funds available to the State (or the
grantee) under such Federal program to re-
imburse such State (or the grantee), to-
gether with interest thereon calculated
under section 6503(d) of title 31, United
States Code.
(b) For purposes of this section, the term
‘‘State’’ and the term ‘‘grantee,’’ including
United States territories and possessions,
shall have the meaning given such terms
under the applicable Federal program under
subsection (a). In addition, ‘‘to continue car-
rying out a Federal program’’ means the
continued performance by a State or other
Federal grantee, during the period of a lapse
in appropriations, of a Federal program that
the State or such other grantee had been
carrying out prior to the period of the lapse
in appropriations.
(c) The authority under this section ap-
plies with respect to any period in fiscal year
2019 (not limited to periods beginning or end-
ing after the date of the enactment of this
Act) during which there occurs a lapse in ap-
propriations with respect to any department
or agency of the Federal Government receiv-
ing funding in this Act which, but for such
lapse in appropriations, would have paid, or
made reimbursement relating to, any of the
expenses referred to in this section with re-
spect to the program involved. Payments
and reimbursements under this authority
shall be made only to the extent and in
amounts provided in advance in appropria-
tions Acts.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Department
of the Interior, Environment, and Related
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill
shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally
divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations or their re-
spective designees.
The gentlewoman from Minnesota
(Ms. MCCOLLUM) and the gentleman
from California (Mr. CALVERT) each

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Minnesota.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and include
any extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota?
There was no objection.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
I rise today in support of H.R. 266,
the fiscal year 2019 Department of the
Interior, Environment, and Related
Agencies Appropriations Act.
Today is the 21st day of the Trump
shutdown, and the damage it inflicts
on the families and communities
across this country continues to grow.
More than 800,000 Federal workers
are without pay, and today will be the
first missed paycheck for those fami-
lies. Many of our civil servants are
working without pay, and telling them
that they have to file for unemploy-
ment is outrageous and it is wrong.
Today, Democrats are offering this
bill that provides critical funds to re-
open the Department of the Interior,
the Environmental Protection Agency,
Indian Health Service, and other im-
portant agencies.
Our national parks, America’s crown
jewels, are under threat. This adminis-
tration continues to allow visitors to
enter as if everything is normal.
Our Park Service does not have the
funding to ensure visitor safety, ad-
dress the most basic standards of
cleanliness, and protect park assets.
Joshua Tree National Park is experi-
encing significant damage because
there are not enough rangers to stop
off-road driving in the park. New
tracks are being cut into the sensitive
landscape, and many of Joshua’s trees,
the precious namesake of this park,
have been destroyed.
Just this past week, the Department
of the Interior announced an illegal
plan to force parks to start redirecting
funds from entry fees. Now, those fees
are designated for capital improvement
projects, and now they will be used to
clean toilets.
There is no substitute for the park
system’s annual operation budget of
$2.5 billion. As I said, lasting damage is
being done to our national parks, and
their long-term upkeep is being com-
promised.
We must ensure public safety and
protect our pristine spaces; and that is
why I am calling on the National Park
Service to close all parks until the gov-
ernment reopens.
Congress needs to pass this bill to
fully fund and staff and protect our na-
tional parks. Passing this bill will
allow the Forest Service to get back to
work on critical activities, like haz-
ardous fuel management. That work
needs to happen now in order to pre-
vent wildfires.
The Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’s mission is to protect human
health and the environment, but the
Trump shutdown has furloughed more
than 13,000 employees, stopping inspec-
tions at drinking water systems, stop-
ping inspections at hazardous waste
management facilities, and stopping
inspections at chemical facilities. This
places the health of the American peo-
ple and their communities in jeopardy.
The Trump shutdown is particularly
threatening to the health and safety of
our Native American brothers and sis-
ters. Once again, we have failed to
meet our treaty responsibilities to
Tribal nations. Basic services like
health clinics, Tribal justice services,
and food assistance for seniors, are
being put at risk for nearly 1.9 million
Americans throughout Indian Country.
Approximately 54 percent of the In-
dian Health Service budget goes to
Tribal organizations to run their own
programs. During the Trump shutdown,
critical programs in Indian Country
run by Tribal organizations stop. This
includes the Domestic Violence Pre-
vention Initiative, the Indian Chil-
dren’s Program, the Suicide Prevention
Program, and Alcohol and Substance
Abuse Programs.
Native American Lifelines is an ex-
ample of a healthcare program that is
under contract with the Indian Health
Service. Clinics focus on care for the
needy and the elderly, and I am out-
raged to report that, as of today, these
remarks that I deliver, well, those clin-
ics have been forced to close, and they
will not be able to continue to coordi-
nate care for their patients, like the 80-
year-old woman who depends on Native
American Lifelines to help her manage
her type 2 diabetes.
It is time to reopen the government.
The Interior bill before us was drafted
by the Senate, passed overwhelmingly
with a bipartisan vote of 92–6.
This bill also should be familiar to
everyone as it was part of a six-bill
package that passed overwhelmingly
on the House floor with bipartisan
votes last week. This bill provides $35.9
billion, which is $601 million over the
fiscal year 2018-enacted bill. It main-
tains funding for nearly every agency
at or above the fiscal year 2018-enacted
level, including the Environmental
Protection Agency.
It is important to note, however, this
bill does not contain any new partisan
riders.
Now, clearly, I would have written
things differently, especially with re-
gard to funding for Indian Country.
However, this bill will immediately
open up the Department of the Inte-
rior, the EPA, and other agencies, and
give us a path forward to end the
Trump shutdown.
Last year, Congress had the oppor-
tunity to pass the bill negotiated by
the Conference Committee, but Repub-
lican leadership controlled the floor
and they chose not to finish their
work.
And then we thought there was an
agreement to keep the government
open while the issues of homeland secu-
rity were being worked out. Senator
MCCONNELL brought the continuing

resolution to the floor of the Senate
and it passed unanimously. But Speak-
er Ryan, along with President Trump,
decided to shut down the government,
and Congress went home.
Now, nearly 800,000 employees are
without a paycheck today, and Demo-
crats are doing everything that we can
to quickly pass a bipartisan bill to re-
open the government. We need to finish
last year’s work so that we can move
forward to serve the American people
in 2019. So I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to support this
bill.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition
to H.R. 266, the Democratic proposal
for funding the Department of the Inte-
rior, the Environmental Protection
Agency, and related agencies for the
remainder of fiscal year 2019.
This bill is almost entirely a Senate
product. As such, it ignores the bipar-
tisan priorities of the House and, per-
haps even worse, it abdicates congres-
sional responsibility under the Con-
stitution to keep the executive branch
in check.
Before I get into the details of the
bill, however, I want to take a moment
to congratulate my friend and col-
league, BETTY MCCOLLUM, for her ap-
pointment as the new chair of the
House Appropriations Subcommittee
on Interior, Environment, and Related
Agencies.
She has been a tireless advocate for
programs under the jurisdiction of this
subcommittee, a firm but fair overseer
of agency operations, a tough nego-
tiator and, above all, a good friend. She
will be an outstanding chair. I wish her
well, and I look forward to working
with her in both of our new capacities.
Madam Speaker, over the past year,
Ms. MCCOLLUM and I worked in collabo-
ration to write a bill representing the
needs and priorities of the House. We
held nine budget oversight hearings,
including four hearings with nearly 80
Tribal leaders regarding programs that
honor treaty rights promised to our
Native American brothers and sisters.
We wrote a bill that accommodated,
in some shape or form, roughly 93 per-
cent of all House Member requests, re-
gardless of party. On top of that, when
the bill came to the House floor, 70
amendments were debated and 50 were
adopted.
And when told to begin negotiating
the House-passed bill last year, we de-
fended it against competing priorities
in the Senate. We came together on nu-
merous topics to write report language
directives that maintain a check on
the executive branch.
I am extremely proud of our work.
We are so close to a final product. We
shouldn’t be throwing it all away with
the bill before us today, a bill that the
Senate has already said it will not con-
sider and the President will not sign.
Let me highlight just a few of the
House priorities missing in this prod-
uct which concern me the most, and
which are likely to concern our col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle.
First and foremost, the bill leaves be-
hind all congressional report language
directives. These directives are critical
for keeping the executive branch in
check. These directives are also the
conduit through which the concerns of
our constituents back home are heard
directly by agency officials at the
highest levels.
All of our colleagues in the House
who have worked with their constitu-
ents and worked with the Appropria-
tions Committee over the past year to
craft these directives understand the
effort that went into them and the im-
pact they have on people’s lives back
home. The bill before us today throws
that away, all that important work.
We included language to protect the
California WaterFix from frivolous
lawsuits in order to move forward a
water supply project that is critically
important to my constituents. By tak-
ing up this Senate bill, I am prevented
from even fighting for my constituents.
But this isn’t about my priorities;
this is about all of the bipartisan prior-
ities of the House of Representatives
that are flushed away by rubber-stamp-
ing the Senate bill.
The bill provides $12 million less than
last year’s House-passed bill for the
U.S. Geological Survey’s natural haz-
ards research and early warning sys-
tem, the earthquake system, and $21
million less for the Forest Service and
Department of the Interior to clear
dead and dying trees from our forests
in order to prevent more catastrophic
wildfires like the kind we experienced
in my own State of California.
b 0930
These ounce-of-prevention programs
save lives and save money. With so
many fires, earthquakes, volcanoes,
and other natural disasters in recent
years, these programs should be a high-
er funding priority than they are in
this bill.
Additionally, this bill provides $77
million less than the House Republican
bill for EPA’s WIFIA, brownfields, and
Superfund remedial programs. These
programs provide regulatory relief, le-
verage Federal dollars, improve water
infrastructure, and spur economic de-
velopment.
Instead, this bill increases funding
for EPA regulatory programs. In many
parts of the country, particularly agri-
cultural States, EPA regulations and
additional red tape are a bipartisan
concern.
Even popular EPA grant programs,
like the diesel emission reduction
grants, DERA, and targeted airshed
grants, were significantly reduced in
this bill.
The DERA and targeted airshed
grants are essential to my home State
of California, where air quality re-
mains one of our biggest concerns. My
State and constituents rely on these
grant programs to help improve air
quality and public health by accel-
erating the replacement of older en-
gines with new, cleaner engines.
For our National Park System, the
bill before us today falls $27 million
short of the House-passed level for park
operations and reducing the mainte-
nance backlog. With park visitation on
the rise, this is no time to cut corners
on the budget.
This bill also lacks important re-
forms for implementation of the En-
dangered Species Act, and it lacks the
funding needed to prevent the sage
grouse from being listed. Failure to
prevent a listing will hurt local econo-
mies in 11 Western States and under-
mine our Nation’s energy security.
This bill is almost $10 million below
last year’s House-passed bill in funding
for historic preservation grants, in-
cluding civil rights grants and grants
to underserved communities.
The House felt so strongly about
these programs that it added $5 million
in multiple amendments on the House
floor last year. Why would we give up
all that funding by acceding to the
Senate?
Last, but certainly not least, this bill
falls $160 million short of last year’s
House-passed bill in funding treaty ob-
ligations to American Indians and
Alaska Natives through the Depart-
ment of the Interior and the Indian
Health Service.
Earlier this week, USA Today was
the latest news agency to run a front
page article on the sad state of
healthcare in Indian Country, which is
funded mostly through the Indian
Health Service in this bill. Funding for
the Indian Health Service in this bill is
$135 million below last year’s House-
passed level.
For an Indian health system that al-
ready is rationing the kind of
healthcare that most of us take for
granted, every dollar makes a dif-
ference in the quality of life of one of
our fellow Americans whose ancestors
paid in advance with their lives and
their land to guarantee that the Fed-
eral Government would care for the
health of their descendants. Properly
funding this obligation is not optional.
The House heard from nearly 80 trib-
al leaders in hearings last year about
the importance of funding these pro-
grams. Let’s not turn our backs on
them now, acceding to the Senate posi-
tion.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons
and others, I am strongly opposed to
this bill, H.R. 266, and I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
stand up for their constituents’ prior-
ities and oppose the bill as well.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I
couldn’t agree more with my colleague
and the former chair. When we were de-
veloping the bill, we had a much supe-
rior product as we came out of con-
ference committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H489
January 11, 2019
But it is time to move forward.
Speaker Ryan did not bring that to the
floor. We must move forward and begin
our work, our important work, on 2020.
Madam Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes
to the gentlewoman from New York
(Mrs. LOWEY), the chairwoman of the
full Appropriations Committee.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, the
Trump shutdown is now in its 21st day.
It is outrageous that more than 800,000
Federal employees are going without
pay, many of them while they are still
working, and the American people are
being denied vital services, all because
of President Trump’s demands for a
wasteful border wall.
The bill before us today would reopen
the Environmental Protection Agency,
Department of the Interior, and other
critical agencies, such as the Indian
Health Service and the Chemical Safe-
ty and Hazard Investigation Board.
The Trump shutdown has suspended
cleanups of hazardous materials and
delayed lifesaving rulemaking to keep
toxic chemicals like methylene chlo-
ride out of American homes.
The Trump shutdown threatens the
enduring natural beauty and conserva-
tion efforts of our national parks as
trash piles up and the safety of visitors
is in question.
Public health and safety should not
be political bargaining chips.
House Democrats have passed bills to
open the government, but the Presi-
dent and the Senate Republicans con-
tinue to obstruct and delay instead of
working with us to get the people’s
business done.
The solution to this crisis is simple:
pass the bills where we can agree and
extend funding for Homeland Security
for a month to allow time for negotia-
tion on border security and immigra-
tion policy.
Madam Speaker, I hope that my col-
leagues across the Capitol come to
their senses and stop this ridiculous
Trump shutdown.
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I
yield as much time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Texas
(Ms. GRANGER), the ranking member of
the Appropriations Committee.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in opposition to H.R. 266.
Unfortunately, moving this bill
across the House floor will not resolve
the partial government shutdown, as
the President has said he will not sign
this bill into law.
It is the job and responsibility of
Congress to appropriate funds. We
must come together to find a solution
that will reopen the government and
fund border security. We need a com-
promise that represents the will of
both Chambers and the American peo-
ple.
By considering the Senate-passed
version of the appropriations bill, we
are eliminating House Members’ in-
volvement in the process. This bill in
particular ignores 93 percent of all
House Member requests that were in-
cluded in our bill, including the 50
amendments that were adopted on the
floor.
This appropriations bill for the Inte-
rior Department fails to include the $12
million that House Members provided
to U.S. Geological Survey programs,
like the earthquake early warning sys-
tem that saves lives.
It also reduces the amount of funds
available to clear dead and dying trees
from forests, to help prevent the kind
of devastating wildfires we saw this
year, by $21 million.
We have heard a lot about the Na-
tional Park Service during this shut-
down. This bill reduces funding for our
national parks by $27 million.
These are just a few of the priorities
of the House that are not included in
this bill before us today.
Madam Speaker, Republicans stand
ready and willing to negotiate with our
friends on the other side of the aisle on
legislation that includes priorities of
both parties and both Chambers. That
is how this legislative body and our
system of government are designed to
work.
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league from California, Mr. CALVERT,
for his efforts today and over the last
several months to ensure that the
House’s voice is heard in this debate.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LEE), a member of
the Appropriations Committee.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, let me thank Chairwoman
MCCOLLUM for her leadership on this
issue as we try to get the government
open.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the fiscal year 2019 Interior ap-
propriations bill, which provides $35
billion to partially reopen the govern-
ment.
Now, this bill would also reopen our
beautiful national parks and the
Smithsonian museums. The situation
in our parks right now, it is just not
acceptable. Sixteen thousand Park
Service employees are not working.
Let me repeat that: 16,000 employees.
The National Park Service is losing
$400,000 a day from this shutdown,
while uncollected garbage is piling up.
Madam Speaker, this is horrible. It is
ridiculous.
We need this bill to reopen our parks,
our museums, and our visitors’ centers
right away, and we need to pass this
bill to keep visitors safe and end the
furlough of law enforcement personnel
in our national parks.
Madam Speaker, these closings are
impacting every district in our Nation.
Near my own district, for example, in
the beautiful bay area, Muir Woods had
to close this week.
In addition to wreaking havoc on
Federal workers’ lives, their families,
their children, and their livelihoods,
this Trump shutdown is also having an
effect on tourism and the economy.
So I urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes’’ on this bill and ‘‘yes’’ to reopen-
ing the government. The public de-
serves this. The Federal workers de-
serve this. Contractors deserve this.
The parks and our museums should be
open for visitors to visit, and we need
to get this government working again.
Madam Speaker, I thank, again,
Chairwoman BETTY MCCOLLUM for
yielding me time.
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT).
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I
thank Ranking Member CALVERT for
yielding and for his leadership on this
bill that we passed back in December.
Unfortunately, as you know, I am ris-
ing, Madam Speaker, in opposition of
H.R. 266.
What we have before us today, how-
ever, is yet another Democrat appro-
priations bill that fails to reflect the
House priorities. This time, it ignores
93 percent of all the House Member re-
quests that were included in the House
bill and in the report.
I would like to point out just a few of
the many House Member priorities
that were addressed in the House Re-
publican Interior and environment bill
that are not addressed in this current
bill.
Compared to the House Republican
bill, this bill reduces funding for haz-
ardous fuel reduction projects by $21
million. It also reduces funding for op-
eration and maintenance of the Na-
tional Park System by $27 million. It
does not include any of the Endangered
Species Act reforms, which are abso-
lutely necessary for the law to work in
a practical way.
Therefore, Madam Speaker, rather
than spending our time debating Sen-
ate-passed legislation, which fails to
reflect any House priorities, I ask that
the Democrats come to the negotiating
table so we can secure our border, so
we can keep America safe, and so we
can resolve this partial shutdown that
we are now entering on its 21st day.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker,
the time to pass the 2019 bill was De-
cember of last year. We need to move
forward. My priority is to get the gov-
ernment open, to get it back working
for the American people, and to have
the Federal employees who are work-
ing so hard and those who are forced to
be home to have a paycheck.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), who is the
chair-designee of the Military Con-
struction, Veterans Affairs, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee of the
Appropriations Committee.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge
my colleagues to support this appro-
priations bill, which provides funding
for the Department of the Interior, the
Environmental Protection Agency, and
related agencies.
This bill would provide vital funding
for water infrastructure, State drink-
ing water systems, national parks, and

Everglades restoration projects. Yet we
have been locked in a nonsensical shut-
down because President Trump con-
tinues to insist on his ineffective and
offensive border wall scheme.
While the President throws a tan-
trum, people are suffering and our en-
vironment is suffering.
Many of us have seen the pictures of
the piles of garbage. Our environment
cannot withstand this onslaught. They
are overflowing in many of our na-
tional parks.
Our national parks are the crown
jewels of our Nation’s natural heritage.
In 2017, the National Park System drew
more than 330 million visits, including
more than 10 million in my home State
of Florida.
These visits are not just from Ameri-
cans, but also from people all around
the world who came to see the natural
wonders America has to offer.
In 2017, national parks contributed
$35.8 billion to the Nation’s economy
and $613 million to Florida’s economy,
and they supported 306,000 jobs nation-
wide. Yet, today, many are closed or
short-staffed, and a diminished law en-
forcement presence puts the well-being
of visitors and wildlife at risk.
This is not the only major con-
sequence of President Trump’s and con-
gressional Republicans’ efforts to block
funding for the shuttered agencies that
would be restored by this legislation.
EPA has stopped making inspections
of drinking water systems, hazardous
waste management sites, and chemical
facilities. During the last long shut-
down in 2013, EPA stopped inspecting
more than 1,200 sites of environmental
importance and concern.
Now more than ever, we need the
EPA to provide rigorous guidance and
support for State drinking water agen-
cies.
b 0945
No one knows this more than the
residents of Flint, Michigan, whose
water is still not safe to drink. And
closer to my home, Floridians in Ocala
face the contamination of their water
by harmful fire retardants used at the
nearby fire college. Halting inspections
leaves communities like these more
vulnerable. These cuts can truly im-
pact the people we are elected to serve.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote for this bill so that the Senate can
once again pass it and the government
can be reopened.
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Idaho
(Mr. SIMPSON), the former chairman of
the committee.
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from California, my
good friend, for yielding and for the job
that he has done as chairman of the In-
terior, Environment, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee in the past.
Let me begin by saying that we all
want the government to reopen—all on
this side, all on that side. We don’t
agree with this shutdown. I also want
strong border security, and I know you
all want strong border security. We dis-
agree about how to get there.
These can both be accomplished with
a little word called ‘‘compromise.’’ I
heard everybody throw around that
word quite a bit and then go back to
their hardened positions and forget
what a compromise is. So I looked it up
in the dictionary, because I thought
maybe I was mistaken about what a
compromise is.
The dictionary says it is ‘‘a settle-
ment of differences by mutual conces-
sions; an agreement reached by adjust-
ment of conflicting or opposing claims,
principles, et cetera, by reciprocal
modification of demands.’’
We can’t call for a compromise and
then go back to our hardened positions
and say: ‘‘I want everything I want,
and you get nothing you want.’’
This bill is not a compromise. If you
would bring up the compromised con-
ference bills between the House and the
Senate, you would have my support,
but that is not what this is. This is the
Senate bill.
We have a conference bill between
the House and the Senate that was pre-
pared to be brought to the floor last
year and never made it. Bring up that
conference report.
Unfortunately, by adopting just the
Senate bill, we might not even have a
House Chamber. Why have a House
Chamber if all we are going to do is
adopt whatever the Senate decides to
do?
This bill, as has been mentioned, re-
duces funding by $160 million from the
House bill for Indian Country, and has
a:
$21 million reduction from the House
bill for hazardous fuels reduction that
prevents catastrophic wildfires;
$23 million reduction from the House
bill in sage-grouse funding, which is
vital to keeping the species off of the
endangered species list;
$27 million reduction from the House
bill for national parks funding, which
is needed to solve the maintenance
backlog; and
$12 million reduction from the House
bill for the Water Infrastructure Fi-
nance Act, which is critical to financ-
ing community water projects, given
the enormous backlog that exists for
our water system.
The bill also leaves out vital report
language directives from the House bill
that were carefully crafted to represent
House Members’ priorities, both Repub-
lican and Democratic priorities. They
are being totally ignored with this leg-
islation.
In the end, we all know that this
isn’t going anywhere. This is just a
game. And I have got to tell you, Mr.
Speaker, I am tired; I am tired of the
finger-pointing, the name-calling, and
the games we are playing.
I know that on the Democratic side
of the aisle you are getting phone calls
by the hundreds, if not thousands, from
your constituents who say: Don’t give
in to Trump; don’t give in to any bor-
der security wall or fencing or what-
ever.
We are getting the same phone calls
on our side, who say: Don’t you vote
for anything that doesn’t have Trump’s
border wall in it.
The uncomfortable thing is that, oc-
casionally, as elected Representatives,
we are called upon to lead, regardless
of the consequences; and I have to say,
we have all failed, all of us, and for
that, I am very, very sorry.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I have
a rhetorical question, and that would
be: If we had been able to bring the
continuing resolution to the floor, if
we would have been able to get the
President to sign it, would that have
given us the breathing space to bring
back the conference committee reports
and would the President have signed
it? I have not heard the President offer
that as a solution.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PIN-
GREE), a member of the Appropriations
Committee, who proudly serves on the
Interior, Environment, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
our future chair for yielding me the
time. I appreciate it.
Mr. Speaker, I consider it a privilege
to sit on the Interior, Environment,
and Related Agencies Subcommittee,
where we fund agencies and depart-
ments that are important not only na-
tionwide, but especially in my home
State of Maine. So it is particularly
heartbreaking to be here today urging
my colleagues to reopen these agencies
as we open a 21st day of an unnecessary
government shutdown.
Today marks the first day that many
Federal Government employees will go
without a paycheck. There are over
1,100 Federal workers and their fami-
lies in Maine alone. These include fam-
ilies at Maine’s Acadia National Park
and the Rachel Carson National Wild-
life Refuge, the USGS research centers
and the air and water program officers
at the EPA. This shutdown has made
life extremely difficult for these work-
ers and these families, and it has halt-
ed the critical duties that they per-
form.
This bill funds vital programs that
we use every day to protect our re-
sources, to learn about the environ-
ment, and to connect Americans to our
national treasures.
So far, the administration has used
accounting gimmicks to give the ap-
pearance that these parks and agencies
remain open, but you can’t hide the
real consequences of this shutdown.
For example, at our national parks,
there have been reports of habitat de-
struction, injuries, and even deaths
since the beginning of the shutdown.
We don’t need gimmicks. We need to
reopen the government. Despite the
President’s refusal to do his job, I am
proud that we are doing ours in Con-
gress by moving these appropriations
bills forward to reopen the govern-
ment.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the American tax-
payer, to support Federal workers and

their families, and to support the vital
environmental programs that are fund-
ed in this bill. Please vote ‘‘yes’’ on
H.R. 266 and end the shutdown.
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE), my friend.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my
friend not only for yielding, but for his
distinguished 4 years as the chairman
of the Interior, Environment, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee. I want
to congratulate my good friend, the
former ranking member and now the
new chairman of the House Interior,
Environment, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee as well. They worked
very well together over the last several
years. I know they will continue to
work well together, and I know that we
will continue to do good work on that
committee.
Mr. Speaker, to quote the great base-
ball player and American philosopher,
Yogi Berra: ‘‘It’s déjà vu all over
again.’’
We considered this bill last week.
The Senate told us at the time that if
we sent it to them, they weren’t going
to take it up; and the President said,
by the way: I am not going to sign it.
So what are we doing this week? We
are sending the exact same bill. The
Senate has told us the exact same
thing, and the President has told us the
exact same thing.
If anybody thinks this is accom-
plishing anything, it is not. Quite
frankly, we should be embarrassed as
Members of the House of Representa-
tives to bring this bill to the floor.
There is not a single speaker in this
Chamber today who had a single thing
to do with anything in this bill—no ap-
propriator, nobody—totally a Senate
product. So every speaker who gets up
and talks about how important this is,
literally, had nothing to do with writ-
ing it. As a matter of fact, in many
cases, they had to give up things that
they succeeded in getting into the
House bill, both Democrats and Repub-
licans.
I think, frankly, candidly, honestly,
any of us would admit the House bill
and the conference product that was
finished is a much better bill than this.
If we are going to bring something to
the floor where we disagree, why don’t
we at least bring something we are
proud to bring here.
Nobody should be proud to bring a
bill that actually cuts what the House
did in Indian healthcare by $135 mil-
lion.
Nobody should be proud to bring a
bill to the floor that cuts $26 billion
out of the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
which we all agreed on, collectively,
and were concessions, frankly, that we
were going to win in the course of a
conference.
So the bill is an embarrassment, and
the outcome is going to be predictable.
The Senate is not going to pick it up.
The President would not sign it if it
were sent to him.
So we have wasted an entire week.
We have wasted the week because our
friends can’t sit down and split the dif-
ference, which, by the way, the Presi-
dent offered us in December. He asked
for $5 billion. He told the negotiators: I
will take $2.5 billion.
Splitting the difference is usually a
definition of compromise. Instead, we
hurtled on into a government shut-
down that nobody in this Chamber
wanted, but we have a standoff at the
top level.
I don’t think anybody particularly
looks good in this: the President, the
Senate, and certainly not the House. I
would hope after we go through this
charade—and it is a total charade—
that we get back to work. If we are
going to present something here, let’s
at least present something we are
proud of and that we actually partici-
pated in writing.
Again, this will end another sad week
in this Chamber. I urge the majority to
get to work. Produce something that a
Senate that is of the other party will
pass and that a President will sign. If
you don’t, you are not governing.
To just be immovable and then point
fingers as if other people are respon-
sible, people who actually offered you a
compromise to split the difference in
December that would have avoided the
entire shutdown, I think the responsi-
bility is pretty clear as to who brought
the government to a close, and that is
our friends’ failure to sit down and ne-
gotiate seriously with the United
States Senate and with the President
of the United States.
Mr. Speaker, I will oppose this meas-
ure and certainly will look forward to
voting against it in the hope that we
will eventually get back to the product
that we wrote and produced and would
actually serve the American people
better than this piece of legislation.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, as I
asked a rhetorical question earlier: If
the President would say, ‘‘I am going
to do a short CR; I will sign it; we are
going to let the conference committee
refile their bills for 2019 to open up the
rest of the government, get the people
back to work, and get the paychecks
back into those families’ hands; and
while we are doing that, we will nego-
tiate the Homeland Security bill,’’ I
would be all for that, but I have not
heard that come from the President of
the United States.
So today, Mr. Speaker, I bring a bill
to bring paychecks back to people who
don’t deserve to be pawns in this gov-
ernment shutdown.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER),
the Democratic Majority Leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding. I think
this is my first time in a long time of
having a magic 1 minute, so I have
some things to say.
I was on the Appropriations Com-
mittee for 23 years. I came here in 1981.
Between 1981 and 1995, we had 10 shut-
downs. Those 10 shutdowns averaged 1.9
days a shutdown. The longest one was
3 days. They were because of dif-
ferences, not because of a strategy.
In 1995, Newt Gingrich adopted shut-
ting down government as a strategy, as
a taking hostage not only of Federal
employees, but taking hostage of the
American Government and taking hos-
tage of everyone who is served on a
daily basis by the Federal Government.
The reason I know it is a strategy is
because it has happened a number of
times.
The next one, long-term, was in 2013,
when TED CRUZ, a United States Sen-
ator, came over here and talked to a
number of Members and said: Unless
the President will repeal the Afford-
able Care Act, we are not going to fund
the government. In other words, unless
the President didn’t take healthcare
away from Americans, the Republicans
would take government services away
from Americans and hold hostage the
Government of the United States.
And now, just a few years later, la-
dies and gentlemen, the Republicans
have again taken hostage not only
800,000 people who work for the Federal
Government, expecting them to work
for no pay to protect our borders, to
protect our seas, to protect our food,
and so they have taken hostage the
Government of the United States one
more time.
So we have a crisis, but the crisis is
not at the border. There is a challenge
at the border, and we need to make our
border secure. We are for that.
b 1000
The proposal the President made in a
campaign speech which got a lot of
roars all the times he gave it was: We
need a wall, a big wall, a wall along the
whole border, a wall that the Mexican
Government will pay for. It was total
campaign rhetoric and demagoguery. It
was not a policy.
And I agree with my friend from
Idaho. Mr. SIMPSON is the former
speaker of the Idaho House. The far
right in his party ran a candidate
against him a few elections ago and
they got beaten badly. Thank heavens
for that; thanks to the judgment of
voters in Idaho.
I agree with my friend, TOM COLE, in
part. But if he were here—unfortu-
nately, he has left the floor—but I
would say to TOM COLE: Mr. COLE, as
you ended the Congress with your side
in charge, you rejected a bill from the
United States Senate, passed with
unanimous consent, that would have
opened up all of government.
And you rejected that bill because
the President told you to put $5.6 bil-
lion in the bill, which you knew—and I
am sorry, TOM COLE is not on the floor
because he says, you know, this bill is
not going to pass—which you knew
would not pass the United States Sen-
ate, but you sent it anyway. Why? Be-
cause the President of the United
States told you to do so.
Let me remind all of us that we are
a coequal branch of government. We
are the Article I branch of government.
We are the policymakers of govern-
ment, not to sit as stooges and be told

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H492 January 11, 2019
by the President of the United States:
If you don’t do what I want, what I tell
you to do, I won’t sign the bill.
Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday night, the
President went on television and tried
to argue that the American people
should continue to endure a painful
government shutdown until Democrats
give in on funding for a border wall
that has bipartisan opposition. Demo-
crats and Republicans alike—not all—
oppose this $5.7 billion waste of money
on a physical wall along the border.
Representative WILL HURD—now, who
is WILL HURD? He is a Republican Mem-
ber of the Congress of the United
States. He is a Member of the Congress
of the United States from Texas. He
represents a district which has more
border than any other district in Amer-
ica. What does he say?
Building a wall is the most expensive and
least effective way to secure the border.
But the President of the United
States says: You don’t do that, I am
not playing. And because he is not
playing, none of you are playing.
I say to my Republican friends: How
sad. You were not elected by your con-
stituents to do what Donald Trump
tells you to do. You were elected by
your constituents to do what is best for
them and their country.
Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM, a friend of
the President, a Republican, and a Sen-
ator from South Carolina said this:
The border wall is probably not a smart in-
vestment.
But the President has told LINDSEY
GRAHAM: You are not for my wall, I am
not for your bill, and I won’t sign it.
And I am going to shut down govern-
ment.
One person is responsible for shutting
down government. Donald Trump. Most
of the people he shut down and is not
paying, they don’t have a dad they can
go to and say: Give me some money,
dad. Maybe he doesn’t know that expe-
rience.
Opposing a new barrier, Acting White
House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney—
listen to me, my Republican friends—
said in 2015:
You go under. You go around. You go
through. What they need is more manpower,
more technology, and more willingness to
enforce the law as it exists today.
He said that in 2015. Not a wall. More
manpower, more technology, more
willingness. That is essentially what
WILL HURD said.
Senator RON JOHNSON, one of the
most conservative Senators in the
United States Senate said he always
thought that the President’s wall was a
‘‘metaphor.’’
Now, if it is a metaphor for security,
we are in, because we Democrats want
a border that is secure; that does not
allow people who are not authorized to
come into the United States. We want
to be sure that the people, the crimi-
nals that bring drugs into the United
States are caught and prevented from
doing so, and that people who traffic in
human lives are caught and stopped.
We are for that.
When the President was at the border
he said that Democrats don’t care
about crime. They don’t care about
human trafficking. That is baloney. It
is a lie. It is unworthy of a President of
the United States to make such an as-
sertion.
Senator JOHN CORNYN of Texas said:
I don’t think we are just going to be able
to solve border security with a physical bar-
rier, because people can come under, around
it, and through it.
That is why so many Republicans
said the wall is not the answer. Rank-
ing Member MICHAEL MCCAUL—now he
is the ranking member of the Foreign
Affairs Committee, I tell my Repub-
lican friends, Mr. Speaker—but he was
chairman of the Homeland Security
Committee when he said this:
A 30-foot concrete wall is a very expensive
proposition and there are a lot of other
things we can be doing technology-wise to
make it a smarter border that is more effec-
tive and more cost efficient.
So don’t accuse the Democrats be-
cause they are against the wall of
being against border security. Your Re-
publican leaders don’t believe that, so
they ought to stop saying it.
They are among the Republicans and
Democrats who believe we need a
smarter, more comprehensive strategy
to improve border security; not just
building a physical wall with taxpayer
money.
President Trump said over, and over,
and over, and over, and over again that
Mexico was going to pay for this wall.
God knows how any American voters
believed that. Now, of course, not sur-
prisingly, he admits that is not going
to happen.
So let’s discuss border security,
which is important to Democrats and
Republicans alike. Let’s sit down and
figure out how best to do it. That is a
debate on policy.
But, by the way, my Republican col-
leagues did not bring the homeland se-
curity and the border security issue to
the floor until December 20, 112⁄3
months after they took control—or
they were in control, because it was
the last of the session. So they waited
11 months and 20 days to bring this
critical issue to the floor. My, my, my.
Now they shut down the government
if we don’t do it their way. This is a de-
bate on policy, not politics. That is
why I quoted so many Republicans.
There is no reason to maintain a dan-
gerous and costly government shut-
down while that debate occurs.
Let’s end this shutdown right now
and turn to the real discussion about
border security without holding hos-
tage America’s workers, their families,
and the people they serve, all of our
constituents. Let’s have a vote in the
Senate which I believe would reopen
government.
Leader MCCONNELL has a responsi-
bility to do so. Leader MCCONNELL has
a responsibility to the Senate and to
his oath of office to the Constitution
and to the country. He swore no oath
to President Trump. None of us swear
an oath to the President of the United
States. We swear an oath to the Con-
stitution, to preserve and protect and
serve our people.
On August 24, 2014, Senator MCCON-
NELL said this: ‘‘I am the guy that gets
us out of shutdowns. ‘‘Shutdowns,’’ he
said—this is Senator MCCONNELL—‘‘is a
failed policy.’’
That is what Mr. SIMPSON said. That
is what Mr. COLE, I know, believes. I
have talked to him about it. I hope
every Member here believes that. So
my plea is to stop pursuing it as a
strategy.
Remember, 10 shutdowns averaged 1.9
days. Your shutdowns, 21 days, 16 days,
and now we are going to have the long-
est shutdown in history, because you
have taken captive the Government of
the United States. How sad that it is us
who are the enemy of the Government
of the United States.
Senator MCCONNELL, I hope, will
bring bills to the floor to open up the
government as he did in December
when he sent a bill here and you would
not take it up, my Republican friends,
when you were in charge. You were the
leaders. You rejected that bill that
would have funded government, kept
government open, kept serving the
American people. But, no, you took a
hostage, and the government is shut
down.
The Democratic-led Congress is doing
its part. The first day we came here, we
passed a bill that was exactly like the
Senate’s bill. So one could assume that
the bill they had passed, when they got
it back, would, in fact, pass. And the
homeland security we did for a short
time so we could continue negotiations
in a positive way without having hos-
tages being taken.
Last week, we passed a package of
funding bills for fiscal year 2019, a con-
tinuing resolution for the Department
of Homeland Security, in order to re-
open government and end the Trump
shutdown. The Trump shutdown. The
Trump shutdown.
If Trump said to Senator MCCONNELL:
Yes, I will sign the bill; the bills would
be passed by the United States Senate.
No one disputes that.
If Trump said to the House Members
here, Mr. Speaker, that he would sign,
they would pass the bill. Trump articu-
lated at the White House that he would
not open government until we agreed
to do what he wanted to do. That is not
democracy. That is despotism.
Because Leader MCCONNELL was re-
fusing to bring up our package of ap-
propriation bills, the very same bills
written by the Republican Senate, as
has so often been said—and I would
prefer that they were bipartisan bills—
we are now sending him each of the
bills individually.
On Wednesday, we passed a bill that
would, among other things, reopen the
IRS so taxpayers can get their refunds.
They paid in more than they owed and
they ought to get it back and they

ought to get it back in a timely fash-
ion. But the folks who process the re-
funds are not being allowed to come to
work.
Yesterday, we passed the Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Food and
Drug Administration, and Related
Agencies Appropriations Act which
will continue nutrition assistance for
those facing hunger, and reopen pro-
grams helping farmers in rural Amer-
ica. Many of you represent rural farm-
ers, and they are relying on payments
from the Department of Agriculture to
sustain them, and they are not getting
them.
Yesterday, we also passed the Trans-
portation, Housing and Urban Develop-
ment, and Related Agencies Appropria-
tions Act to restore safety to air travel
and keep low-income Americans from
losing rental housing assistance. I
don’t think there is any Republican
that wants to see people out on the
street because they couldn’t make
their rent because they didn’t get their
payment from the Federal Govern-
ment.
Today, we are bringing this Depart-
ment of the Interior, Environment, and
Related Agencies Appropriations bill to
the floor to reopen America’s National
Parks and restore services to Native
Americans and Tribal communities.
I want to thank the gentlewoman
from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM) for
the leadership that she has shown and
the work that she has pursued to bring
this bill to the floor. I ask my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
vote on the merits of this bill, and I
hope that many Republicans will join
us.
If Members are for reopening govern-
ment, vote ‘‘yes.’’ If you vote ‘‘no,’’
you are for continuing this Trump
shutdown.
I hope Leader MCCONNELL listens to
his Senators. Senator SUSAN COLLINS
said this on the House-passed bills last
Thursday.
It would be great to have them signed into
law because there is not great controversy
over them and at least we would be getting
those workers back to work.
b 1015
Senator CORY GARDNER, Republican
from Colorado, added: ‘‘We should con-
tinue to do our jobs and get the govern-
ment open.’’
I agree, Mr. Speaker.
Hopefully, when we vote today, we
will have in mind the 800,000 people
who are not getting paid, half of whom
are working. Hopefully, we will have in
mind all those who are looking for a
tax return, all those who are looking
for a supplemental nutrition payment
so they can put food on their tables, all
those who are looking to make sure
they can settle on their house because
FHA is operating, and all those who
need a visa extension or something of
that nature.
Hopefully, we will be thinking of
them, not just the small-bore politics
of: If you don’t do what I say, I won’t
play.
Vote for this bill. Send it to the Sen-
ate.
Mr. Speaker, I say to Senator
MCCONNELL to put it on the floor, pass
it, and send it to President Trump.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
LUJÁN). Members are reminded to
avoid engaging in personalities toward
the President.
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume to
point out that leaders in the Border
Patrol want a barrier as a part of se-
curing the border. Most people the ma-
jority leader mentioned are also in
favor of a barrier as part of securing
the border, as that is something that
acts like, using a football metaphor, an
offensive line. It slows people down in
order for technology and people at that
point to pick up people who are coming
into this country illegally with drugs
or otherwise illegal activity.
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. JOYCE).
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to highlight some of my con-
cerns with H.R. 266.
As a Representative from the great
State of Ohio, I know full well how im-
portant it is to provide programs that
ensure we are protecting our natural
resources and preserving them for fu-
ture generations.
One of the greatest natural resources
and economic powerhouses we have in
the United States and for the world, for
that matter, is the Great Lakes sys-
tem, which my district is lucky enough
to have a portion of. The lakes provide
more than 35 million people with
drinking water. They support more
than 3,500 species of plants and ani-
mals. Studies have shown that 1.5 mil-
lion jobs are directly connected to
these five lakes, generating $62 billion
in wages. That is why I have fought so
long and so hard for the Great Lakes
Restoration Initiative.
As Members of this House, we have a
responsibility to properly represent the
people who sent us here to fight for
their priorities and needs. Unfortu-
nately, this bill falls far short of ful-
filling that responsibility. The fact is,
there is bipartisan, bicameral report
language that would not go into effect
if the bill before us were signed into
law.
It leaves out important language to
reduce the growth of harmful algal
blooms, which have been recorded in
every State and have become a concern
nationwide. In fact, in 2014, a harmful
algal bloom in Lake Erie affected the
drinking water for more than 500,000
people in Toledo, Ohio.
The bill also leaves out language en-
couraging the EPA to fund research
grants that help promote scientific
progress toward preventing and con-
trolling harmful algal blooms. It
doesn’t include language to help both
rural and urban communities control
nutrients in their watersheds. It
doesn’t include language about work-
ing to understand the risks of exposure
to toxins that result from harmful
algal blooms. These toxins can come
through our drinking water and can be
extremely harmful to humans.
In the end, this bill does not include
the priorities that many Members
fought for to help their constituents. It
does not include language that sup-
ports programs that impact Ohio, as
well as many other States across the
country. I cannot in good faith support
legislation that does not treat our
Great Lakes as the national treasure
they are or invest in them to the full-
est extent.
Mr. Speaker, please stand with me
today in sending a message to protect
our Great Lakes. I urge my colleagues
to oppose this bill in its current form.
We can do much better than this. We,
as Members of the House, must not ab-
dicate our responsibility to craft these
spending bills in the best interest of
our constituents.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I also
hail from one of the Great Lakes
States. The funding in the Senate bill
and the House bill for the Great Lakes
was identical. So at least in this por-
tion of the funding, it was equal for
both the House and the Senate.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
HUFFMAN), who is a member of the
House Natural Resources Committee.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding, and I
rise today in support of this bill to re-
open our national parks and end the
Trump shutdown.
Over the last 3 weeks, the conditions
in our national parks have reached un-
acceptable and unsafe levels as park
employees are furloughed without pay
and forced to keep quiet about the on-
going damage.
Here is what some of it looks like:
dirty diapers, coffee cups, and burrito
wrappers. That is just the start of what
Congresswoman JACKIE SPEIER and I
saw this past weekend as we joined vol-
unteers for a trash cleanup at the Gold-
en Gate National Recreation Area,
which we both represent. It took only a
few minutes for us to fill two 32-gallon
trash cans with waste.
We may soon have enough trash
building up in our national parks to
build a wall.
Is that the idea, Mr. Trump? Is that
the backup plan, to have our parks,
park visitors, and our professional park
staff pay for the wall you said Mexico
would pay for?
Mr. Speaker, the damage from the
Trump shutdown does not end there. I
have more than 25 federally recognized
Tribes in my district. Each of those
communities faces serious financial in-
security as a result of this shutdown. I
refuse to stand by as Indian Country
suffers, as our national parks suffer,
and as millions of Americans suffer, so
that Donald Trump can pretend he is
building a medieval border wall.
We need the House and Senate to
pass the Interior appropriations bill.
We need the President to sign it to pre-
vent further degradation of our public

lands and protect the health and safety
of Tribal communities.
This government does not belong to
Donald Trump. It belongs to the Amer-
ican people. It is time to reopen the
government.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from the
great State of Utah (Mr. STEWART).
Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to begin by stating the obvious, if
I could, when my Democratic col-
leagues call this bill a compromise.
This bill is a lot of things, but a com-
promise it is not. It takes away every-
thing we have done for the last year—
everything we have done for the last
year—and, poof, it is gone. It throws it
away.
There is an old saying in the House:
It is not the opposing party that is the
enemy; it is the Senate.
This is a great illustration of this. As
a member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, it pains me that my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle have ef-
fectively removed my constituents
from this process by just accepting the
Senate bill. Every Member of the
House and our constituents have been
silenced in this. We are not represented
at all.
Not only has the Democratic major-
ity ignored this body’s role in creating
this budget, they are throwing away
hundreds of hours of hearings, of mark-
ups, and of floor time, again, as we are
fighting for our constituents. We
passed a bill. The House has done our
work. Let me say it again: The House
has done our work.
If this was a serious effort by our
friends on the other side to open the
government, then they would pass our
House bill again. Then it would go to
the Senate, and we would reconcile
those two bills.
Let’s consider some of the things
that have been thrown away, poof,
magically gone in a puff of smoke:
money for fighting wildfires; money for
our Indian brothers and sisters, includ-
ing for hospital staffing; money for
road maintenance, so that children can
go to school; and money for our na-
tional parks for deferred maintenance.
The list goes on and on.
I ran for Congress because I wanted
to represent my district. This bill is
my district; 70 percent of my district is
owned by the Federal Government.
How can I just sit by and say that my
constituents will have no voice in this
bill or in this appropriations process at
all?
Finally, my friends on the other side
know these bills don’t stand a chance
of actually becoming law. They know
that. The Senate won’t take these up.
The President has said he won’t sign it.
Mr. Speaker, if you want to talk
compromise, then let’s actually try to
do that. Let us take where we are and
let us take where the Senate is and try
to bring them together. That, Mr.
Speaker, is compromise.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume to
say, once again, I am sorely dis-
appointed that, before the end of De-
cember and before the new Congress
came into being, some of the sugges-
tions here were to move forward with
conference committee reports, to bring
them to the floor, to work with the
President. Now that we have the new
Congress sworn in, for the President to
say: You get those conference com-
mittee reports going. We will do a con-
tinuing resolution to keep government
open. We will negotiate the Homeland
Security bill off to the side—but there
is silence. There is no commitment.
Quite frankly, I don’t know if the
President would change his mind
again, if he did agree to that.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Washington (Mr. KIL-
MER), who is a member of the Appro-
priations Committee and serves on the
Interior, Environment, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee.
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of this bill, which will restore funding
for the Department of the Interior, for
the Forest Service, and for the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency, because
it is simply wrong for Federal workers
to be held hostage. It is wrong for peo-
ple who depend on these agencies to be
held hostage as a negotiating tactic on
a completely unrelated policy issue.
The region I represent has more than
600,000 acres of Federal forests. It is the
home to Olympic National Park, one of
the crown jewels of the National Park
System. And it overlooks the iconic
Puget Sound. So I am speaking today
on behalf of the hundreds of Federal
workers who protect and manage these
natural resources, from park rangers to
timber sale specialists to water quality
monitors, who have gone unpaid for al-
most 3 weeks.
But this isn’t just about those Fed-
eral workers who have lost their pay. I
am also here to speak on behalf of the
communities that depend on these Fed-
eral resources, gateway communities
like my hometown where I grew up,
Port Angeles, Washington, where the
economy depends on park visitors who
come in and eat at local restaurants,
stay in local hotels, and gas up their
cars; remote towns like Forks that
count on the Forest Service to main-
tain roads; Tribal communities like
Taholah that rely on resources from
the Indian Health Service to support
their local health clinic; and cities like
Tacoma that trust the Environmental
Protection Agency to protect the qual-
ity of their air and their water.
Congress should end this shutdown
now so that Federal workers can re-
ceive the pay that they have earned for
serving us and so that our communities
can again count on the government to
provide taxpayers with the services
that they fund, services that belong to
everyone in this country.
This bill is a responsible way for-
ward. It has already passed the Senate
with the support of 92 Senators, includ-
ing Majority Leader MCCONNELL. Con-
gress should not wait another day to
pass this bill and reopen these agen-
cies, so I urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes.’’
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I point
out to my friend from the State of
Washington that the earthquake warn-
ing system that we both worked on is
below the House number by $9.4 mil-
lion. So that is unfortunate.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.
WESTERMAN).
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from California
for yielding and for his hard work in
putting together an appropriations
product of the House, which is a far cry
from what this bill is. It is not a prod-
uct of the House. It is more like some-
thing you would get from the bill of
the month club. It has none of the
House priorities that have been de-
bated here.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to think
about the number 85. Eighty-five peo-
ple perished in the Camp fire last year
in California. The blaze destroyed an
entire community, burned 14,000
homes, and left hundreds of other
Americans injured or homeless. Adding
to that, the Camp fire was just one of
thousands of blazes that burned 9 mil-
lion acres across the country last year.
Let’s face the facts. More and more
Americans are living closer to our Na-
tion’s forests. These forests are becom-
ing sicker, drier, and overstocked with
flammable materials. When the tem-
peratures rise and the arid winds blow,
we have seen firsthand how these
unhealthy forests become objects of
mass destruction.
The U.S. Forest Service now esti-
mates that there are at least 43 million
homes in the wildland-urban interface.
That is the part of our country where
forests and communities intersect.
This is a major increase from the 31
million homes that were located there
less than 20 years ago.
Meanwhile, millions of acres of pub-
lic land are at a high or severe risk of
wildfire. Like Paradise, California,
some of these acres directly threaten
the communities and the Americans
who live nearby.
Mr. Speaker, the notion that Con-
gress would lower the level of haz-
ardous fuels reduction in the wake of
all this is outrageous. At a base level,
the government must protect its citi-
zens, and hazardous fuels reduction is
designed to remove the tinder that
fuels these deadly blazes. However, this
version of the Interior appropriations
bill drops $21 million out of the haz-
ardous fuels reduction account.
Mr. Speaker, we should be investing
more on hazardous fuels reduction and
sound forest management, not less.
Forest management is the essential
component in protecting Americans
who live next to our Nation’s forests,

again, forests that are getting drier
and deadlier with each passing year.
Further hazardous fuels reduction
leads to all sorts of environmental and
economic benefits. In addition to pro-
tecting American lives, proper forest
management leads to cleaner water,
more rural jobs, and less carbon in the
atmosphere.
b 1030
I am all for fiscal soundness, but, Mr.
Speaker, cutting the hazardous fuels
money is illogical. It is like saying we
prefer a pound of cure over an ounce of
prevention. While we may save money
up front, the American people are
going to have to pay more over the
long term as taxpayers foot the bill to
put out these blazes and property own-
ers have their homes and assets incin-
erated.
In closing, we should be investing in
protecting lives and property and being
good stewards of our environment.
Lowering the hazardous reduction fuels
account accomplishes the exact oppo-
site, failing the thousands of Ameri-
cans who live in and around our for-
ests.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman
and I would both be concerned. I quote
from one of President Trump’s tweets:
‘‘Billions of dollars are sent to the
State of California for forest fires that,
with proper forest management, would
never happen. Unless they get their act
together, which is unlikely, I have or-
dered FEMA to send no more money. It
is a disgraceful situation in lives and
money.’’
Mr. Speaker, I would just like to note
that the bill that we will pass today,
hopefully shortly, will provide $1.76
million more than House Republicans
passed last year for the Department of
the Interior wildland fire management
and $26 million more for the U.S. For-
est Service for wildland fire manage-
ment.
Mr. Speaker, I think we should all
grieve for loss of life and loss of prop-
erty for those who have been impacted
by our wildland fires.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA), the chair of the House Natural
Resources Committee.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to add my voice of support for
the Interior appropriations bill to fund
the government.
Trump’s ongoing government shut-
down has damaged our economy, our
national parks, and our public lands.
This damage that we see is not an inev-
itable outcome; this is directly Repub-
lican-inflicted damage.
Trump and his enablers seem happy
to let this shutdown slow our economy,
hurt Indian Country, and put our na-
tional parks and public lands at risk
indefinitely.
It shouldn’t be hard for our Repub-
lican colleagues to choose between
funding normal government operations
or continuing to make people suffer for
the Trump ego and obsession.
This bill is nearly identical to the
legislation that already passed the
Senate 92–6. It reopens vital agencies
and returns our national parks to nor-
mal business. This means we can clean
up the trash and repair the damage
that has been done through this shut-
down.
Opposing this bill encourages Trump
to keep holding Americans hostage to
his delusional demands.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Will the gentleman
yield for a question?
Mr. GRIJALVA. I gladly yield to the
gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.
MCCOLLUM).
Ms. MCCOLLUM. As you know, Mr.
Chairman, I feel as strongly as you do
about the health and protection of our
public lands. In your view, as chairman
of the committee that oversees the In-
terior Department, is the administra-
tion protecting the quality of our pub-
lic lands during this shutdown?
Mr. GRIJALVA. Reclaiming my
time, the administration has not done
enough to protect public safety or the
quality of our public lands during this
shutdown. New roads have been bull-
dozed through protected land in Joshua
Tree National Park because staff was
not there to prevent it. Hikers have
been injured and had to rely on volun-
teers to carry them to safety. We all
heard about the trash piling up at pre-
cious sites across this country.
Every day, we see more damage to
our public lands, and that involves,
also, the vandalism and looting on pro-
tected areas, cultural areas, and his-
toric resources in our public lands and
parks. I haven’t seen any serious will-
ingness from the administration to end
this shutdown and get back to normal
operations.
Ironically, the permitting for gas,
oil, and mining continues, unabated, at
the expense of the public taxpayers and
employees and, of course, our public
lands and parks. Though the permit-
ting process in the refuge and in other
parts of New Mexico and Oklahoma
continues unabated, this is one part of
this shutdown that was not affected at
all.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Will the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA) yield once
more?
Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield to the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOL-
LUM).
Ms. MCCOLLUM. I agree with my
colleague that this administration,
when it comes to public lands, is mak-
ing matters worse, not better, by
choosing to keep some parks open dur-
ing the Trump shutdown. This political
attempt to minimize the consequences
of the shutdown will only result in fur-
ther damage to our national treasures
and place the safety of visitors at risk.
Using funds from fee collections to
provide operations support to the parks
hurts the parks in two ways: This
small funding stream cannot replace
the $2.5 billion we provide for park op-
erations each year that ensures the
safety of visitors, maintains clean and
orderly park operations, and safe-
guards park assets. Redirecting these
funds away from their intended pur-
pose delays the capital improvements
needed to sustain our parks for our fu-
ture.
Because of this, I join the gentleman
in urging the President to close the
parks for the remainder of this Trump
shutdown or, better yet, to sign this
bill into law so that our parks can open
fully and safely.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, re-
claiming my time, I am very grateful
for my friend’s, Representative MCCOL-
LUM’s, leadership on this issue and for
the tireless efforts of the Appropria-
tions chair and Speaker PELOSI. They
are working on behalf of the people to
fund and reopen this government.
I want to make one particular note.
While the harm to our parks has been
noted, the damage to Indian Country is
less documented and, in many cases,
much more personal and devastating.
According to a January 1 New York
Times report, the shutdown has
trapped members of the Navajo Nation
in their homes due to unplowed roads
in remote areas and has put many
Tribal members and their families in
severe economic stress.
Law enforcement officers continue
working without pay because they are
Federal employees. Similar scenarios
are reported and are playing out in
Tribal land across this Nation.
The National Council of Urban Indian
Health found that 62 percent of the
Urban Indian Health Centers will need
to cancel programs or cease offering
services if the shutdown continues.
That process has already begun.
Today, I launched an online tool for
Americans to share their stories of how
the Trump shutdown impacts their
lives. I ask them to share their experi-
ence of being furloughed, forced to
work without pay, and turned away
from visiting public lands and denied
essential services. Trump and his sup-
porters need to listen to these stories.
I encourage everyone to speak out on
social media with the hashtag my shut-
down story.
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I have served on the Ap-
propriations Committee for a long
time, and I am proud of the work that
we have been able to accomplish in a
bipartisan and bicameral manner,
which is the history of the Appropria-
tions Committee.
Unfortunately, the Senate bill before
us today forces us to choose between
abdicating our constitutional obliga-
tions and underfunding important pro-
grams in a way that is unacceptable to
me and my constituents. I am afraid
this is a bad precedent, and I hope that
this does not happen in the future: we
just accept whatever the Senate deter-
mines is the proper path forward.
I am disheartened by the Democrats’
closed process that throws our bipar-
tisan House priorities and will neither

Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
two articles dealing with the adminis-
tration’s illegal use of taking fees to
keep our parks and refuges open.

HOUSE PANEL TO ‘DEMAND ANSWERS’ ON INTE-
RIOR’S MOVE TO USE VISITOR FEES TO KEEP
PARKS OPEN
(By Miranda Green and Timothy Cama)
The House Natural Resources Committee
intends to investigate the Trump adminis-
tration’s decision to dip into visitor fees to
keep parks open, the panel’s chairman
warned Sunday.
Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D–Ariz.) said that his
committee—which oversees Interior—has
plans to look into the legality of the deci-
sion, saying the shutdown has done ‘‘terrible
damage’’ to the U.S.
‘‘President Trump and his advisors appar-
ently just woke up to the fact that the shut-
down they created several weeks ago has
done terrible damage to our country,’’ Gri-
jalva said in a statement Sunday.
‘‘This is not how a rational president be-
haves, and the Natural Resources Committee
will demand answers about whether these
moves are legally justified.’’
The National Park Service (NPS) an-
nounced to staff Sunday a plan to dip into
‘‘entrance, camping, parking and other fees
collected from park visitors’’ to pay staff to
assist in urgent maintenance needs at a
number of national parks overburdened by
visitors during the recent government shut-
down.
‘‘As the lapse in appropriations continues,
it has become clear that highly visited parks
with limited staff have urgent needs that
cannot be addressed solely through the gen-
erosity of our partners,’’ Daniel Smith, NPS
deputy director, said in a statement obtained
by The Hill.
Smith said he and acting Interior Sec-
retary David Bernhardt developed the plan
to ‘‘address the maintenance and sanitation
issues that have arisen at a number of highly
visited parks.’’
‘‘We are taking this extraordinary step to
ensure that parks are protected, and that
visitors can continue to access parks with
limited basic services,’’ the statement read.
Bernhardt signed a memorandum Saturday
to use the fees known as Federal Lands
Recreation Enhancement Act money, The
Washington Post reported.
Jonathan Jarvis, who led the Park Service
under President Obama from 2009 to 2017,
slammed the strategy as a ‘‘significant de-
parture’’ from how the agency has histori-
cally used the money parks.
‘‘Since [the Federal Lands Recreation En-
hancement Act’s] original passage, it’s al-
ways been interpreted by the Park Service as
not available for operations,’’ said Jarvis,
who worked in the agency for more than
three decades, including as director of the
Pacific West region.
‘‘This is a significant departure. It wasn’t
even a consideration during the 16-day shut-
down when I was director,’’ he said, referring
to the 2013 shutdown. ‘‘That’s eating your
seed corn.’’
Jarvis worried that using the fee money in
this way would take it away from park
maintenance, which has a backlog nearing
$12 billion across the country.
Jarvis had officials close parks entirely
during the 2013 shutdown, despite criticisms
from Republicans and others. He’s been high-
ly critical of the Trump administration’s
strategy to keep them open with little to no
staff.
‘‘It sends a particular message that they
don’t really care about the resource, and
probably increasingly, they don’t seem to
care about the visitor either,’’ he said.
‘‘They only seem to care about the bad press
that they’re getting.’’
The gates to most U.S. national parks were
left open under the most recent shutdown,
which has extended since Dec. 22. While visi-
tors have been able to access parks, many
services including bathrooms and trash pick-
up was suspended as government employees
were kept home. That’s created a number of
headaches across the country at highly vis-
ited parks where trash is piling up, bath-
rooms are at capacity and visitors aren’t
being watched by experts.
At least one park, Joshua Tree National
Park in California, was shuttered due to
‘‘health and safety concerns.’’
While in the past access to national parks
has been restricted during a shutdown due to
safety concerns, former Interior Secretary
Ryan Zinke made keeping parks up a pri-
ority during his tenure.
During the last shutdown last January,
Zinke told reporters the parks shouldn’t be
used as a bargaining chip in shutdown nego-
tiations.
‘‘Our public lands and our monuments real-
ly belong to the people and not the govern-
ment,’’ he told CNN.
He said however, ‘‘by law’’ Interior wasn’t
allowed to provide clean up services to
parks.
‘‘Law enforcement is still there. But things
like cleaning the bathrooms . . . and telling
the story of our parks, which is important—
that side of it, while the ‘Schumer shutdown’
is in, by law we’re not able to provide those
services,’’ Zinke said, mentioning the GOP
label for the shutdown at the time.
In an interview earlier this week Zinke
told The Associated Press that the public
should ‘‘Pitch in, grab a trash bag and take
some trash out.’’
Zinke’s last day at Interior was Jan. 2. He
resigned from the agency in December amid
multiple ethics investigations.
However, Interior’s plan to dip from the fee
pot was laid out clearly in its 2019 shutdown
contingency plan, which read: ‘‘Parks that
collect fees under the Federal Lands Recre-
ation Enhancement Act (FLREA) will utilize
available retained recreation fees balances
to provide basic visitor services in a manner
that maintains restrooms and sanitation,
trash collection, road maintenance, camp-
ground operations, law enforcement and
emergency operations, and staffing entrance
gates as necessary to provide critical safety
information.’’
Spokesmen for Interior and NPS did not
return requests for comment.
Critics are questioning the legality of Inte-
rior’s decision to use the park fees, money
that is assigned by Congress to pay for other
federal expenses, including the department’s
multibillion-dollar maintenance backlog.
Theresa Pierno, president of the National
Parks Conservation Association, called
NPS’s action the equivalent of stealing.
‘‘Instead of working to reopen the federal
government, the administration is robbing
money collected from entrance fees to oper-
ate our national parks during this shut-
down,’’ she said in a statement.
‘‘It’s incredibly concerning that the Acting
Interior Secretary is putting political pres-
sure on Superintendents to keep parks open
at the expense of parks’ long-term needs and
protection.’’
Out of the 418 park units across the coun-
try, 165 collect fees, and they took in $285.2
million in fiscal year 2017, according to a re-
port last year by the Congressional Research
Service. Usually, at least 80 percent of that
revenue has to stay with the park that took
it in, and the rest can go to other parks.
At least one group, the National Park Hos-
pitality Association, applauded the agency’s
fee strategy. The organization represents
companies that operate businesses in parks,
like gift shops, restaurants and lodging.
‘‘NPHA has actively supported visitor fee
retention by federal recreation providers and
use of collected funds for visitor-related pur-
poses,’’ Scott Socha, the group’s chairman
and president for parks and resorts at
Delware North Cos., said in a statement.

GOVERNMENT RESTAFFS WILDLIFE REFUGES
DURING SHUTDOWN TO ALLOW HUNTERS AC-
CESS
(By Ellen Knickmeyer)
WASHINGTON.—The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service is directing dozens of wildlife refuges
to return to work to make sure hunters and
others have access despite the government
shutdown, according to an email obtained
Wednesday by The Associated Press.
The partial restaffing of 38 wildlife refuges
is angering wildlife groups, who accuse the
Trump administration of trying to minimize
the public impact of the more than two-
week-old shutdown to limit the political
blowback for President Donald Trump.
Trump and Democrats in Congress are
locked in a dispute over Trump’s demand for
billions of dollars for a wall on the southern
U.S. border.
In an email sent Tuesday afternoon, Mar-
garet Everson, principal deputy director of
the Fish and Wildlife Service, cites ‘‘oppor-
tunities, including hunting’’ that are being
lost in the shutdown.
Everson advises in the email that 38 wild-
life refuges around the country will bring
back some furloughed staff using carryover
funds.
‘‘While many of our refuges have remained
accessible, but not staffed, the extended
lapse in federal appropriations is impacting
both our ability to serve the public and to
protect natural resources under our care in
some places,’’ Everson wrote.
‘‘For the next 30 days, using previously ap-
propriated funds, we will bring back a lim-
ited number of employees to resume work on
high priority projects and activities that
support the Service’s mission and meet the
public’s desire for access to Refuge lands,’’
Everson said in the email.
Everson did not immediately respond to an
email from the AP seeking comment.
The shutdown has forced federal agencies
to stop paychecks for hundreds of thousands
of government employees, limiting govern-
ment services to only the most pressing,
such as Transportation Security Administra-
tion workers providing security at airports
without pay.
Unlike as in some past shutdowns, the In-
terior Department—which oversees both
wildlife refuges and national parks—initially
had directed national parks to stay open but
with little staffing, leading to pile-ups of un-
collected garbage and human waste in parks.
The National Park Service over the weekend
said some parks could start using visitor fees
to staff during the shutdown.

uge Association, the Coalition to Protect
America’s National Parks and the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service Retirees Association

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H497
January 11, 2019
urged the Trump administration to keep na-
tional parks, wildlife refuges and other pub-
lic lands closed to the public during the
shutdown.
‘‘It is simply impossible to steward these
shared American treasures properly, leaving
thousands of lands and waters accessible to
the public with no staff on site, even for an
emergency,’’ the groups wrote in a letter.
Desiree Sorenson-Groves of the National
Wildlife Refuge Association criticized the
partial restaffing of some wildlife refuges.
‘‘If it wasn’t essential to have these ref-
uges open for the past three weeks, how is it
essential now?’’ she asked. The bottom line
was the Trump administration was trying to
‘‘make this less painful to the American pub-
lic,’’ she said.
According to the email, the wildlife ref-
uges being restaffed include Oklahoma’s
Wichita Mountains, scene of an annual win-
ter elk hunt. The other national refuges
staffing up again stretch from the Midway
Atoll in Hawaii to Florida’s Merritt Island.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, re-
sponsibility of funding the government
is one of Congress’ most important du-
ties. Republicans failed to meet this
obligation, and they have allowed
President Trump to peddle chaos.
The Trump shutdown is creating un-
certainty for families, businesses, and
communities. More than 800,000 em-
ployees are not getting paid today. For
that, I am deeply heartsick. Vital serv-
ices are being disrupted and small busi-
nesses are being forced to lay off em-
ployees.
Democrats are ready to end the
Trump shutdown. The Interior bill has
already received bipartisan support
from the Senate. After this House bill
passes, Senate Republicans will have a
choice: pass their own bill and end the
shutdown, or reject it and keep the
government closed.
On Monday, the National Governors
Association sent a letter asserting ‘‘a
Federal Government shutdown should
not be a negotiating tactic.’’ I agree
with the Governors. I am sure that
Federal employees whose paychecks
are being withheld today feel the same
way.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to support this
bill, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 28, the
previous question is ordered on the bill.
The question is on the engrossment
and third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I have a
motion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. CALVERT. In its current form,
yes.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Calvert moves to recommit the bill
H.R. 266 to the Committee on Appropriations
with instructions to report the same back to
the House forthwith with the following
amendments:
Page 2, line 14, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(reduced by $6,000,000)’’.
Page 3, line 8, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(reduced by $6,000,000)’’.
Page 46, line 23, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $6,000,000)’’.
Page 47, line 4, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(increased by $6,000,000)’’.
Page 86, line 24, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $15,000,000)’’.
Page 87, line 6, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(increased by $15,000,000)’’.
Page 88, line 16, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(reduced by $15,000,000)’’.
Mr. CALVERT (during the reading).
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent
to dispense with the reading.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California is recognized for 5 minutes
in support of his motion.
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, the bill
under consideration has $21 million less
for a major House priority than what
was included in the fiscal year 2019 In-
terior and Environment bill passed in
the last Congress. I am talking about
doing more to prevent and stop cata-
strophic wildfires.
For the past 4 fiscal years, the House
has prioritized funding to improve our
national forests and other Federal
forestland through the Department of
the Interior’s and the Forest Service’s
hazardous fuels reduction programs.
These programs use methods such as
thinning, prescribed burns, and remov-
ing underbrush to help unhealthy for-
ests return to a healthy condition.
In fiscal year 2018, Congress provided
$614 million for these programs. Last
year, the House-passed bill increased
that amount by $30 million for fiscal
year 2019. The bill before us today, H.R.
266, only provides a $9 million increase.
My motion to recommit will fix this
major problem and save lives.
The increase is offset by a reduction
in the Bureau of Land Management’s
deferred maintenance account and the
Forest Service’s capital improvement
and maintenance account. These infra-
structure programs received signifi-
cant increases in fiscal year 2018, and
they have a large carryover balance.
Mr. Speaker, my bottom line is that
I cannot support a bill that does less to
prevent catastrophic wildfires. My
home State of California experienced
deadly and record-setting wildfires last
year. I was with the President; former
Governor Brown and current Governor
Newsom; our minority leader; and our
colleague, Congressman LAMALFA, in
Paradise late last year. In 2017, I also
visited Santa Rosa with my colleague
from the northern part of the State,
Congressman MIKE THOMPSON. The dev-
astation I saw was indescribable and
heartbreaking.
While we can and should continue to
debate what more needs to be done to
improve the health of our Nation’s for-
ests, I am proud that the Interior and
Environment Subcommittee, on a bi-
partisan and bicameral basis, has led
the way.
The subcommittee successfully nego-
tiated a forest management reform
package and fire-borrowing fix as part
of the fiscal year 2018 omnibus appro-
priations bill. It allowed for more on-
the-ground forest management activi-
ties. These are the activities that pre-
vent the natural cycle of fires from ex-
ploding into terrible conditions.
b 1045
It provided smarter budgeting for
wildfire suppression costs. The budg-
eting reforms go into effect in fiscal
year 2020.
I am certain that the new chair on
the Interior, Environment, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee, my distin-
guished colleague and friend from Min-
nesota, looks forward to that. It has
been a pleasure to work with her as
partners on the forest management and
wildland fire budgeting issues.
Yet, there is more that we need to
do. Today we can start by supporting
this motion. It will send a strong mes-
sage to the Senate that they should
focus on this issue. More importantly,
it will show Californians and other
Americans affected by wildfire that the
House is doing something about this
problem.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the motion, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise
in opposition to this motion to recom-
mit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, it is
with great reluctance that I read again
the tweet by the President of the
United States:
‘‘Billions of dollars are sent to the
State of California for forest fires that,
with proper forest management, would
never happen. Unless they get their act
together, which is unlikely, I have or-
dered FEMA to send no more money. It
is a disgraceful situation in lives and
money.’’
That was the President of the United
States.
Mr. Speaker, I don’t even know
where to begin with regards to the
President’s recent threat to block dis-
aster response funds to Californians
struggling to restore their lives, to get
back in their homes, after the dev-
astating fires of last year, so I am
going to spend the rest of my time di-
rectly responding to this motion.
I think we can all agree, every single
one of us, that preventing wildfires is
important, and my colleague and I just
disagree on the best path forward. I be-
lieve that the best path forward is to
reopen the government so the U.S. For-
est Service can get back to work on the
activities that prevent wildfires, crit-
ical activities like the hazardous fuel
program that should be going on right

now if we want to prevent fires this
coming year.
Additionally, again, I would like to
note that the bill that we should pass
today provides $1.7 million more than
the House Republicans passed last year
for the Department of the Interior
Wildland Fire Management program
and $227 million more for the U.S. For-
estry Service in wildland fire manage-
ment.
Responsibly funding the Federal Gov-
ernment is one of the most important
duties of Congress. This previous ma-
jority failed to do so with the most
basic task of keeping the lights on.
Here we are, day 9 of the 116th Con-
gress. We Democrats are ready to re-
open the Federal agencies that have
been shut down by President Trump.
This legislation has already garnered
strong support—strong bipartisan sup-
port, I would add—in the Senate. We
need to ensure that the Federal Gov-
ernment is open and that it is working
for the American people and that our
Federal employees get the paychecks
they deserve.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE FAIR
TREATMENT ACT OF 2019
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and pass the bill
(S. 24) to provide for the compensation
of Federal and other government em-
ployees affected by lapses in appropria-
tions.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
S. 24
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Government
Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. COMPENSATION FOR FEDERAL AND
OTHER GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
AFFECTED BY A LAPSE IN APPRO-
PRIATIONS.
Section 1341 of title 31, United States Code,
is amended—
(1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ‘‘An of-
ficer’’ and inserting ‘‘Except as specified in
this subchapter or any other provision of
law, an officer’’; and
(2) by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(c)(1) In this subsection—
‘‘(A) the term ‘covered lapse in appropria-
tions’ means any lapse in appropriations
that begins on or after December 22, 2018;
‘‘(B) the term ‘District of Columbia public
employer’ means—
‘‘(i) the District of Columbia Courts;
‘‘(ii) the Public Defender Service for the
District of Columbia; or
‘‘(iii) the District of Columbia government;
‘‘(C) the term ‘employee’ includes an offi-
cer; and
‘‘(D) the term ‘excepted employee’ means
an excepted employee or an employee per-
forming emergency work, as such terms are
defined by the Office of Personnel Manage-
ment or the appropriate District of Columbia
public employer, as applicable.
‘‘(2) Each employee of the United States
Government or of a District of Columbia
public employer furloughed as a result of a
covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid
for the period of the lapse in appropriations,
and each excepted employee who is required
to perform work during a covered lapse in
appropriations shall be paid for such work,
at the employee’s standard rate of pay, at
the earliest date possible after the lapse in
appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled
pay dates.
‘‘(3) During a covered lapse in appropria-
tions, each excepted employee who is re-
quired to perform work shall be entitled to
use leave under chapter 63 of title 5, or any
other applicable law governing the use of
leave by the excepted employee, for which
compensation shall be paid at the earliest
date possible after the lapse in appropria-
tions ends, regardless of scheduled pay
dates.’’.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS) and the gen-
tleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland?
There was no objection.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
As we, Mr. Speaker, enter day 21 of
the Trump shutdown, it is incumbent
upon the House to do everything we
can to address the pain and suffering
being felt by dedicated Federal workers
who are missing their paychecks.
Most of them are living from pay-
check to paycheck, and now they ap-
proach this day, on Friday, having
moved from paycheck to no check.
Today, 800,000 Federal employees will
not receive their first paycheck of this
new year. Regardless of what Members
think about the causes of the shut-
down, every single one of us should
agree that hardworking Federal em-
ployees who give their blood, their
sweat, and their tears to lifting us up
as a Nation should not be held hostage
to politics as a result.
Mr. Speaker, 380,000 Federal employ-
ees have been furloughed and locked
out of their offices. Another 420,000
hardworking Federal employees are
working without pay.
We will see them at our airports. We
will see them working today and to-
morrow, as they have been for the last
many days, without pay. Some even
had to cancel already scheduled vaca-
tion days or sick leave to report to
work.
These 800,000 men and women include
personnel at the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration; the Bureau of Prisons;
the Federal Bureau of Investigation;
the Department of Homeland Security;
the Food and Drug Administration; and
the Departments of Agriculture, Treas-
ury, and Justice.
These are the men and women who
keep our country safe, ensure the safe-
ty of our airports and food, protect our
national parks, and, yes, keep our
economy moving.
S. 24 would provide back pay to Fed-
eral employees furloughed during this
shutdown and potential future shut-
downs.
The measure also would allow essen-
tial employees to use their annual
leave instead of having to cancel al-
ready scheduled and approved vacation
plans.
Many Federal employees are suf-
fering. But not only are they suffering,
Mr. Speaker, their children are suf-
fering. They are in pain; they are wor-
ried; and they are scared. You see, they
have mortgages and car loans to pay,
day care expenses to cover, and food to
put on the table.
And even while they struggle to pay
these bills, furloughed employees face
the stress and anxiety of not knowing
whether or not they will be paid when
the shutdown ends. The least we can do
is to relieve that uncertainty.
The President claims that Federal
employees support this pointless shut-
down. He also had the nerve to say:
Why don’t they just adjust.
Adjust with what? And how?
I have not heard from a single Fed-
eral employee that they support this
shutdown. What they want to do is to
get back to work serving the American
people, and what they are saying over
and over again is: Government, do not
hurt us; help us. Do not hurt us; help
us.
So, promising they will receive back
pay once the shutdown ends is the least
that we can do.
Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill passed
the Senate with every single Senator’s
consent, and President Trump has indi-
cated that he will sign it. I urge every
Member of the House to do the same
and support this bill, and let’s end this
shutdown and get the government open
and working again.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H499
January 11, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of S. 24, the Government Employee
Fair Treatment Act of 2019.
This bill is a promise to our dedi-
cated civil servants, both those forced
to the sidelines and those still hard at
work without pay.
When the House Democrats stop
using Federal employees’ livelihoods as
a political football to fund the govern-
ment, including border security, pay-
checks will be issued.
Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle: We get it. You
don’t like the President. You made
your point. It is now time to stop mess-
ing around.
We need to fund the government so
we can make good on the promise in
this bill. And let’s be clear: This bill
does not stop the immediate pain of
missed paychecks. Under S. 24, Federal
employees still do not get paid until
the funding bills are passed and the
government is reopened.
Federal employees will still struggle
to find ways to put food on the table
and make ends meet until the House
Democrats agree to negotiate in good
faith.
This bill also does not reimburse tax-
payers for all the missed government
services like our national parks and
the Indian Health Service.
Every day this shutdown continues,
taxpayers are on the hook for paying
Federal employees for jobs they are le-
gally barred from doing. Every day this
shutdown continues, Border Patrol
agents and other Federal employees
are forced to work without pay.
And every day this shutdown con-
tinues, many Members of Congress are
still getting paid. I have instructed the
administrative officials with the House
to withhold my pay until the partial
shutdown ends and until Border Patrol
agents and other Federal employees
are paid.
Members of Congress should not get
paid when portions of the Federal Gov-
ernment are shut down.
There are other pieces of legislation
that would pay Federal employees who
are working during this partial shut-
down, and there are others that would
hold Congress accountable for not
doing its job.
I will support the Government Em-
ployee Fair Treatment Act, but I urge
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle: End the games. Get back to
work. Let’s get the job done.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. PELOSI), distinguished
Speaker of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Mr. CUMMINGS for bringing this impor-
tant legislation to the floor in very ex-
peditious time. The Senate passed it by
unanimous consent yesterday, and here
we are today, on the first day that
some of our Federal employees will
miss their paycheck, and Congress is
saying and guaranteeing that workers
will be paid, not only for this shutdown
but, God forbid, if we have any future
ones, that their pay will be guaranteed.
b 1100
I support the bill. I am glad that it
has strong bipartisan support as it did
in the Senate and that the President
has given the impression that he will
sign the bill.
It ensures that 800,000 Federal em-
ployees who are going without pay be-
cause of the senseless shutdown will ul-
timately get the backpay they deserve.
But it is scarce consolation for these
workers who are desperate to make
ends meet right now. Their paychecks
are going to be late, but they must pay
their bills on time and in full.
The impact of a missed paycheck is
catastrophic in the lives of these Amer-
icans when they can’t pay their mort-
gage, their rent, their utilities, bills,
their car payments, children’s tuition
on time, and the list goes on. It affects
their credit rating, and it affects the
credit rating of the United States of
America.
I am particularly concerned about
the impact that it has on our veterans.
A large percentage of the Federal
workforce are veterans. They have
taken their commitment to public
service in the military to public serv-
ice on the civilian side. We don’t do
any favors for our friends, our veterans
and military families, if we affect their
credit rating.
So, today, the press reported that
workers are desperately taking to the
internet to sell some of their household
items and other things, sometimes at a
very reduced price, for just a couple of
dollars just to pay their bills. This is
just not right. It is just not right that
we would subject people who work, and
we say two things to them: come to
work and don’t get paid, or shut them
out so they can’t come to work. And
while they are not getting paid, again,
thousands of these men and women are
expected to show up for work.
Sending these workers their pay-
check late is wrong. We keep saying
that. It is wrong. But since there is a
guarantee that they will be getting
paid, I would hope that the commercial
banks, the banks in our country, would
follow the lead of some of the credit
unions by giving interest-free loans
right now to these families so that
they can pay their bills on time and
they can be respected for the work
they do or are anticipated to do.
This shutdown, by the way, is soon to
become the longest in history, and it is
creating chaos in our communities. It
fails to have us, the government, meet
the needs of the American people. We
are endangering the safety of our food
supply and the security of our airlines.
The eviction of vulnerable families is
affected, as is the support of our farm-
ers, and for their support systems, as
well as food stamps for the hungry and
tax refunds to the American people,
and the ability of the IRS to supply in-
formation to taxpayers who want to
pay their taxes but need guidance. It is
a needless crisis that is inflicting pain
on the American people.
Democrats support effective border
security. We honor our oath of office to
protect and defend, to protect and de-
fend our borders, our country, our peo-
ple, and our Constitution.
We need to look at the facts.
According to the DEA—when the
President says, ‘‘Oh, we have got to
stop the drugs coming into the coun-
try,’’ well, let’s look at the facts. The
DEA says that almost all—90 percent—
of illicit drugs coming into the country
come in through legal ports of entry. If
that is the President’s concern, and it
is a legitimate concern that we all
share, we need to build the infrastruc-
ture, increase the size of infrastructure
of the legitimate ports of entry—those
are ports of entry for immigration, for
trade—and to stop the unwelcome in
terms of drugs, contraband, and weap-
ons coming into our country. So more
infrastructure, improve the roads there
to facilitate.
We also need—the technology ex-
ists—and we have all committed that
we would pay whatever it is, $400 mil-
lion or more, for the technology to
scan the cars, scan the cars for the
drugs and the other contraband. So,
again, technology is our friend in this,
and it is a very effective, proven way to
protect us from those intrusions.
We can hire more personnel, which
we must do. There are thousands of un-
filled positions with the Border Patrol.
We must have more people to do the
job there.
Much of what I am saying here is
what the administration—well, the De-
partment of Homeland Security—asked
for; and we said yes in the appropria-
tions bills, and here we are having that
fight later.
We can have more investment in in-
novation to detect unauthorized cross-
ings. We don’t need, like the President
first described, a concrete wall, 30 feet
high, paid for by Mexico. Cross out all
of the above. It is not that.
But the fact is, spending money on
whatever that is that the President is
describing it now as is an opportunity
cost for doing what we know will work
to secure our border—all of our bor-
ders—all of our borders.
There is a humanitarian challenge
for us at the border that we have to
deal with in a way that is consistent
with our values but also protects our
border. What the President is pro-
posing—in fact, he has exacerbated the
problem with his cruel policies of tak-
ing children out of the arms of their
parents, separating families. The list
goes on.
But to the point of securing the bor-
der in a strong, cost-effective, values-
based way, Democrats have made their
proposal. The proposals have bipartisan
support.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H500 January 11, 2019
And let me just say, just before this
bill came up on the floor, we had the
legislation to pass a bill—passed by the
Senate—to open up the Department of
the Interior and related agencies there.
We have said to the Republicans and to
the President that we will accept ideas,
good ideas, wherever they come from,
and these ideas came from the United
States Senate, controlled by the Re-
publicans up until this new Congress.
Just within the last month, they con-
trolled that—well, they still do control
the Senate.
They put forth legislation on the
floor of the Senate in a minibus that
passed, 92–6. We said: Let’s take your
language; let’s embrace your language;
let’s pass it on the House. And you,
once again, pass your own language.
They won’t take yes for an answer.
That might be part of a legitimate
debate, but why do you have to shut
down government?
I say to the President: ‘‘Don’t you
have confidence in your own ideas that
you have to shut down government to
increase your leverage and then threat-
en to take extraordinary measures
when the answer is very simple?’’
Let’s open up government. Let’s have
a civilized debate, and let’s do so in a
way that honors our values as we pro-
tect our borders and meet the needs of
the American people.
I urge a ‘‘yes,’’ and I am glad that we
are going to come out with a bipartisan
vote.
And, again, I thank Mr. CUMMINGS for
his extraordinary leadership in so
many ways, most recently, on this leg-
islation.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
BLUNT ROCHESTER). Members are re-
minded to refrain from engaging in
personalities toward the President.
Without objection, the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. HURD) will control the
time for the minority.
There was no objection.
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend,
the distinguished gentleman from the
great State of Maryland, for expedi-
tiously bringing this piece of legisla-
tion to the floor, because this is an im-
portant piece of legislation that en-
sures all Federal employees receive
backpay once this government shut-
down is over.
Last week, while flying back to
Washington, I spoke with TSA agents
who were concerned about their pay-
checks and the uncertainty created by
this shutdown. Guaranteeing backpay
is the least we can do to give more cer-
tainty to almost a million Federal em-
ployees, including many in my district,
who are missing their first paycheck
today. I understand their concerns, be-
cause my pay is being withheld during
the shutdown in solidarity with Fed-
eral workers.
We all need to come together and
find a bipartisan and realistic solution
to reopen the government. If we are
going to talk about border security,
then the brave men and women who are
on the ground every day securing our
border should get paid.
Border security and immigration
have been a contentious issue for a
long time, but the only way we solve
big problems here in Washington is by
working together. We need to push
‘‘Pause’’ on requesting specific condi-
tions before talks resume. We need to
lay down our swords and be willing to
find not a Democratic solution nor a
Republican solution, but a solution for
all Americans.
I urge my colleagues to stand with
Federal workers and join me in sup-
porting this commonsense piece of leg-
islation, which was passed unani-
mously by the Senate last night.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY).
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I
thank my dear friend from Maryland
for his leadership. I certainly support
this bill to keep our employees whole.
But I must say, when I hear the dis-
cussion and when I heard the words of
our friend and colleague from Montana,
I thought: ‘‘Are we rewriting history?’’
This isn’t about who likes President
Trump or who does not. Where is the
outrage in this body? When do we fi-
nally say, ‘‘Enough’’?
We had a bill, a bipartisan bill that
passed the Senate. It was ready to pass
here. The White House had said they
would sign it. And because four or five
rightwing talking heads scared the
President of the United States, he
pulled the plug. Democrats didn’t do
that. Republicans didn’t do it. He did
it.
Now you are defending him, enabling
him, even when he says, ‘‘I never said
Mexico would pay for the wall,’’ even
though we have 212 explicit references
in the last 3 years in which he said pre-
cisely that. And meanwhile, because of
that focus, which came out of right
field, 800,000 Federal employees and all
American citizens are held hostage.
When do we come together and say,
‘‘Enough’’? When do we stand up for
those Federal employees who are civil
servants who serve our constituents?
And when do we say this shutdown
threatens the security of the United
States?
It is wrong, and we have had enough.
So it is good that we are going to keep
our Federal employees whole when the
shutdown ends, but let’s come together
and make sure this shutdown ends,
even at the risk of taking on the Presi-
dent of the United States politically.
In the last analysis, can we not come
together and do the right thing for the
American people.
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I am going to continue to reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from the State of Maryland
(Mr. RASKIN).
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the chairman very much.
Madam Speaker, 800,000 American
workers, 800,000 workers in our Federal
workforce, have either been sent home
and furloughed with no check or told
to report to work with no check, with
no payment.
I have got air traffic controllers liv-
ing in my district, Madam Speaker,
who have had to take money out of
their kids’ 529 college funds. They have
had to take money out of their own re-
tirement funds in order to pay their
family bills, and there is a 10 percent
penalty for doing that. Who is going to
pay them back the 10 percent? Is the
President of the United States going to
do that?
What about my constituents? I have
tens of thousands of Federal workers.
What about my constituents who are
being forced to put their mortgage on a
credit card this month? Who is going to
pay them back?
And what about the dishonor and the
humiliation brought on our govern-
ment by this?
The President of the United States
didn’t do this to hundreds of thousands
of workers in Putin’s Russia or in
Orban’s Hungary or in Duterte’s Phil-
ippines. This is our people that he did
this to.
b 1115
These are our workers, who he sent
home with no paycheck. People are
texting me. They are emailing me their
paystubs today, which say zero dollars
gross, zero dollars net, after having
worked 40 or 50 hours this week.
I have scientists in my district who
are working on preventing outbreaks of
E. coli contamination, salmonella, in-
sect infestation of our food supply, and
they have been told not to go to work.
Madam Speaker, this is an outright
outrage and a scandal. At the very
least, we can pass, on a unanimous, bi-
partisan basis, this legislation to try to
repair the damage by saying that every
Federal worker will get back every
penny that he or she is owed by the
United States Government.
We need to make sure that, if this
ever happens again, if the President
ever holds the Federal workforce, the
government, and the people hostage
again, that the Federal workforce will
not be the ones who have to pay for it.
We should pass this immediately, and
we should reopen the government im-
mediately.
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished majority leader of this great

was in the leadership, this shutdown
would not be happening, and if he were
in the leadership, this bill would not be
required. I thank him for bringing it to
the floor with Mr. CUMMINGS. I also
thank him for his leadership in trying
to get this government open.
Madam Speaker, the 800,000 Federal
employees affected by this shutdown
deserve to know that they will be paid
once it ends.
I was with a veteran at a veterans or-
ganization last night who told me the
highest incident of veteran suicide is
brought about by financial instability,
fear of being unable to pay their bills,
fear of being unable to support their
families, fear of being unable to pay
their mortgage. That is what this bill
is about, to give confidence and sta-
bility to those who work for us, who
work for the American people. That is
why this bill is coming to the floor.
I congratulate Senators WARNER and
KAINE from Virginia, and Senators
CARDIN and VAN HOLLEN from Mary-
land, for shepherding this legislation
through the United States Senate.
Normally, I would be proud to bring
this bill to the floor, but none of us
should be proud that this bill is nec-
essary. No one should have to go with-
out a paycheck just because the Presi-
dent thinks he can bully Congress into
giving him what he wants, taking them
hostage in return for a ransom of
agreeing with him.
The American people and the hard-
working Federal employees who serve
them should not be held hostage until
they give their hard-earned tax dollars
to pay for an expensive and ineffective
border wall for which the President
promised Mexico would pay.
So here we are, Madam Speaker, 21
days into what is now the longest shut-
down in our history, with 800,000 Amer-
icans missing their paychecks today
because of Donald Trump. How shame-
ful, how sad.
I hope all of my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle will join me in sup-
porting this bill, and I thank both par-
ties for bringing this bill forward. It
was a bipartisan bill in the Senate, and
I am sure it will be a bipartisan bill
here, because it is not whether you
agree with the shutdown, it is whether
you agree to being fair to our Federal
employees. It is about whether you rec-
ognize and value the service and con-
tribution of our Federal workers.
I am proud, Madam Speaker, to rep-
resent 62,000 Federal employees. I am
proud to represent them, and I am
proud of the work they do. They de-
serve better, frankly, than what they
have gotten from the Congress over the
last 8 years of the Republican major-
ity.
I made the point a little earlier today
that this is a strategy, shutting down
government. The government was shut
down 10 times between 1981, when I
came here, and 1995, an average shut-
down of 1.9 days because you couldn’t
reach agreement—it was going back
and forth, but the government was
open—but not a strategy to hold hos-
tage for many, many days and weeks
our Federal employees until the other
side did what you told them was abso-
lutely essential for them to do or you
were going to hold hostages.
They deserve better than this shut-
down, as do the millions of Americans
impacted by the lack of services pro-
vided by these Federal employees.
This bill would provide a permanent
solution to this problem, not only pro-
viding for backpay during this shut-
down, but guaranteeing that Federal
employees will get paid if any future
shutdowns occur.
I might also observe, although it is
not in this bill, it will be our intention,
and I look forward to working with Mr.
HURD on this, that there are State,
county, and municipal employees also
impacted who rely on the flow of Fed-
eral funds to pay their salaries that we
will address, hopefully, in the future. I
look forward to working with Mr. CUM-
MINGS and Mr. HURD toward that end.
Meanwhile, Democrats will keep
working. We will keep working to end
the current shutdown. And I call once
more on Leader MCCONNELL and Presi-
dent Trump to do their part and reopen
the people’s government.
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I am looking forward to working with
the distinguished gentleman from
Maryland on making sure all employ-
ees are whole.
I continue to reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
it is a pleasure to be able to speak on
the floor, and I thank you for your
leadership.
I thank the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. CUMMINGS), chair of the Over-
sight and Reform Committee, for his
leadership. I thank my colleague from
Texas as well.
I would say only that we can’t say it
enough. Thank you, Chairman CUM-
MINGS, for saying that they are payless
today; they are no check today; they
are no money today; they are no more
money today; they are broke today.
800,000 hardworking Federal employees,
but they are families, small businesses,
all of those who work every day to con-
tribute.
As I go home today, I will be meeting
with, today and tomorrow, Federal em-
ployees. I want them to know that my
office is open to be able to help them,
35,000-plus employees in Texas, Federal
employees—9,000 in the Treasury, 5,700
in Homeland Security, now some 51,000
screeners—who are not getting their
dollars.
I have to pause for this one. The
Coast Guard is not being paid. The very
people that the President went to the
border to celebrate that they are try-
ing to stop the multitudes of criminals,
most of them under 10 years old, the
Coast Guard on the waters of this Na-
tion, the Coast Guard that rescued
1,000-plus in Katrina and that rescued
desperate Houstonians in Harvey, are
not being paid. They are military that
is not being paid because they are
under Homeland Security.
This bill is crucial to ensure that
those hardworking Americans get paid;
that they can use their personal leave;
that no matter what happens, they will
get reimbursed; and that we will make
sure that we will not wait on their pay
period, but they will get it imme-
diately.
Right now, it is crucial for us to pass
this bill to ensure the integrity of all
of us.
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I have no further speakers, and I yield
myself the balance of my time to close.
As the distinguished gentleman from
the Commonwealth of Virginia said, we
should make sure these Federal em-
ployees are made whole. These are men
and women who are making their own
sacrifices to ensure that our country
continues to operate, and I would rec-
ognize and suggest to all my colleagues
to support this piece of legislation that
passed unanimously last night from
the Senate.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank
the distinguished gentleman, Mr.
HURD, for his cooperation in working
with us, always approaching these
issues with a commonsense attitude
and always striving for bipartisanship.
We look forward to working with him
and others to continue to support our
Federal employees.
As this shutdown drags on, it is
wreaking havoc, Madam Speaker, with
the lives of patriotic Federal workers
who just want to get back to work, and
they need their paycheck.
Hundreds of dedicated public serv-
ants have called my office as this shut-
down goes on record as one of the long-
est in history. They are worried and
anxious about how they will pay their
bills.
For example, the shutdown is having
a dire effect on a 30-year employee at
the IRS whose finances and health are
being imperiled. She has multiple scle-
rosis and needs a monthly injection
that has a $50 copay, which she simply
cannot afford. She hasn’t paid her
mortgage, and her lender won’t give
her a break.
This is not an isolated example.
Thousands of Federal employees face
similar circumstances.
Madam Speaker, we must end this
shutdown and send our Federal em-
ployees back to work as soon as pos-
sible. I urge all Members of the House
to vote in favor of this legislation.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

employees should not be harmed by
Congress’s inability to do its work and fund

the government. And while I supported S. 24
for this reason, I have serious concerns about
the legislation’s funding structure.
Though federal employees are generally
paid through discretionary accounts, as written
and passed, the Government Employee Fair
Treatment Act of 2019 does not require sala-
ries for furloughed and excepted staff to be
funded with annual appropriations during a
shutdown. This opens the door for the creation
of new entitlement spending. I do not believe
this was the legislation’s intent, and in the fu-
ture, I will work with my colleagues to provide
for these salaries through their appropriate
discretionary accounts.
I have consistently expressed concerns
about the growth of autopilot mandatory
spending and its impact on our nation’s debts
and deficits. Rather than perpetuating this
problem, we should resolve ourselves to fixing
the budget and appropriations process to en-
sure that Congress fulfills its duty and govern-
ment shutdowns and pay for federal employ-
ees are taken off the table.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in support of S. 24, the ‘‘Government Employ-
ees Fair Treatment Act,’’ which provides for
retroactive pay for nearly 800,000 federal
workers who have been furloughed as a result
of the government shutdown proudly caused
by the President of the United States.
I support this bill because it is the right thing
to do.
The men and women who have been fur-
loughed because of this manufactured crisis
are not responsible for the ‘Trump Shutdown’.
They did not vote to reject the clean con-
tinuing resolution passed by the Republican
Senate but rejected by the President that
would have resolved the crisis and made this
legislation unnecessary.
The dedicated men and women of the fed-
eral civilian workforce, like those who serve in
the Armed Forces, have not spent their pro-
fessional lives trying to sabotage the Afford-
able Care Act or conjuring an imaginary crisis
on the southern border or pursuing policy ini-
tiatives that harm America’s allies and benefit
its adversaries, especially Russia.
Instead, these loyal and committed public
servants are motivated by their paramount in-
terest in serving the American public without
fear or favor and, for the last 20 days, without
any guarantee that they would be com-
pensated for their labor.
And yet, they gladly and willingly serve,
some risking their lives to keep us safe.
Others stand watch monitoring weather sys-
tems and providing information necessary to
protect the public from hurricanes and torna-
does and wildfires or conducting research to
find cures for disease or that will yield techno-
logical innovations or help us mark and meas-
ure the far reaches of space.
Others work to secure the borders and
homeland, ensure the safety of our food and
water, serve our seniors and children, provide
training and support for those looking for work,
and protecting our environment and keeping
watch over our treasures—our national parks
and monuments, including this magnificent
Capitol where the people have sent us to their
business.
Madam Speaker, the men and women of
the federal workforce do the people’s busi-
ness.
They serve everyone equally.
They do not single out some persons to
serve and ignore others.
We should follow their example and the best
way to do that is for the Senate to pass and
the President sign into law the clean con-
tinuing resolution passed by the House on
January 3, 2019; legislation that is identical to
bill the Senate passed 98–0 in the last Con-
gress.
That is the best way to keep faith with all
persons who serve the American people as
employees of the federal government, and
those who depend upon the services they pro-
vide.
Madam Speaker, holding harmless the fed-
eral employees who have been furloughed by
this unnecessary government shutdown is a
matter of simple justice.
I urge all Members to join me in voting for
S. 24.

So (two-thirds being in the affirma-
tive) the rules were suspended and the
bill was passed.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
Stated for:
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably
detained. Had I been present, I would have
voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 29.
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, on roll call vote
29, I was unavoidably detained and unable to
vote. Had I been present, I would have voted
‘‘yea’’ on HR 221, the Special Envoy to Mon-
itor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I unexpectedly
had to return to my district this morning and
was unable to attend the vote series. Had I
been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on
rollcall No. 26, ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 27, ‘‘yea’’
on rollcall No. 28, and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 29.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to
vote on Friday, January 11 due to personal
reasons. Had I been present, I would have
voted as follows: ‘‘yea’’ for rollcall No. 26,
‘‘nay’’ for rollcall No. 27, ‘‘yea’’ for rollcall No.
28, and ‘‘yea’’ for rollcall No. 29.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
my friend from Maryland (Mr. HOYER),
who is the majority leader of the
House, for our first official colloquy.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding. We have re-
versed positions, of course. For a num-
ber of years now I have had the privi-
lege of having a colloquy with Mr.
MCCARTHY who was then the majority
leader. So Mr. SCALISE has now under-
taken my role, a role probably he
didn’t welcome, but I know that he will
do well as minority whip.
As majority leader I am still here
doing the colloquy, and I am proud to
be doing it with Mr. SCALISE who is an
outstanding Member. I congratulate
him on his position and look forward to
working with him through the years
toward trying to create agreement,
consensus, and action by the Congress
on behalf of the American people.
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House
will meet at noon for morning-hour de-
bate and 2 p.m. for legislative business
with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-
hour debate and noon for legislative
business.
On Thursday, the House will meet at
9 a.m. for legislative business with last
votes no later than 3 p.m.
We will consider several bills under
suspension of the rules. The complete
list of suspensions, as is the natural
order, will be announced at the close of
business today.
In addition, Mr. Speaker, we will con-
sider H.R. 268 which is the Disaster
Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2019.
Chairwoman LOWEY released this legis-
lation last week. It will provide relief
and recovery assistance for Americans
affected by recent hurricanes—some of
which were historic in their power and
devastation—wildfires, typhoons, and
other natural disasters.
Mr. Speaker, we will also consider
additional legislation related to fiscal
year 2019 appropriations.
We are on day 21 of the shutdown.
The House Democrats will continue to
work so that it comes to an end as soon
as possible.
Members will also be advised that ad-
ditional legislative items are possible.
I might add to that, it is possible we
will deal with one, two, or three of the
appropriation bills that haven’t been
passed, but it is also quite possible
that, hopefully, we will deal with the
balance of the appropriation bills
which have not been enacted. We will
have to see what transpires over the
next 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours. Hopefully,
we will be able to move forward to get
our Federal employees back to work.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Maryland. I appre-
ciate his kind remarks and would re-
turn those as well.
The gentleman is well-versed at this
process and is a noble battler in the de-
bate of ideas. I look forward to having
continued conversations about, not
only the areas where we may have
some differences, but how we can find
common ground. The gentleman is very
good at working with both sides to find
common ground, and, obviously, right
now we are in the middle of one of
those differences that hopefully can get
resolved.
As we have been in these meetings at
the White House with the other lead-
ers, both House and Senate, Republican
and Democrat, the unfortunate thing is
that we have been at an impasse. The
President, through his Department of
Homeland Security, has made a formal
request and a detailed request for the
amount of money it will take to secure
our border; to properly give our
agents—the people who are risking
their lives to keep our country safe—
the tools they need. It requires a lot of
things. It might require more border
patrol agents, more tools and tech-
nology, but clearly also physical bar-
riers. That seems to be the area where
we have had an impasse.
b 1230
I know that as the President put a
formal offer on the table backed up by
the experts at the Department of
Homeland Security for what it will
take to secure the border, up until this
point, we haven’t seen a formal pro-
posal response to counter that offer, if,
in fact, the gentleman’s side does agree
that we need to secure the border. The
President has made a formal request
that came from our experts at the De-
partment of Homeland Security.
The only offer I have seen put on the
table is the Speaker’s offer, and I am
not even sure if it was serious, when
she said she would support $1. Now, I
know the gentleman from Maryland
would hopefully recognize that $1 is
not a serious counteroffer.
The President has had multiple meet-
ings at the White House and has con-
tinued to extend an invitation for
whenever there is a serious
counteroffer that can be backed up
with an explanation of how that can
actually secure our border, if, in fact,
that is the objective of the other side.
Can the gentleman from Maryland
share with me when that counteroffer
will be made, when a formal, serious
proposal to get our government back
open and secure our border will be put
on the table?
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman
for his observations.
Of course, as the gentleman knows,
we have and continue to be and are
today even more so concerned about
the fact that the President of the
United States has taken hostage the
Government of the United States and
shut it down. As a result, what we have
asked for before we get into serious ne-
gotiations is to let us open up the gov-
ernment; for, after all, when we have
border security being our focus, nobody
that is protecting the borders for the
United States of America is getting
paid. The morale is low; the apprehen-
sion is high; and we believe very
strongly that the first step we ought to
take is open up government.
Then, as the gentleman well knows,
we have articulated on numerous occa-
sions—and I hope the gentleman be-
lieves we are honest. And when the
gentleman reviews the record of when
we were in charge of the House and the
Senate, we made very substantial in-
vestments in border security, as I
think probably the gentleman knows.
Furthermore, we have been ready to
support and offered the bills that the
Republicans have passed. And, in fact,
I think the minority leader in the Sen-
ate said that he would accept the num-
ber that the President suggested, and

HOUSE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H506 January 11, 2019
we made some counteroffers. They
were rejected.
In fact, Senator MCCONNELL believed
he had an agreement with the Presi-
dent on keeping the government open.
He sent us a bill to do just that in the
waning days of December, and as the
minority whip well knows, that bill
was not taken up on the floor of this
House.
In fact, a bill which had been pending
for 111⁄2 months in committee first
came to the floor with 10 days left in
the year. That bill included a number
far above the number that the Presi-
dent originally asked for and far above
any number that had been discussed.
Although it passed the House, the
House knew then, very well, that it did
not have the votes in the Senate to
pass, and it did not pass. As a result,
the government shut down.
And we continue to be in a place, as
we said at the White House, to nego-
tiate on border security to secure our
borders, to protect our people from
those who would come across our bor-
ders to commit crimes, protect against
drugs being imported, protect against
the trafficking of human beings. We all
share that view: Republicans and
Democrats. The issue is how we most
effectively accomplish that objective.
Pending that, the government, as we
took power—and it was our responsi-
bility—what we have done over the last
2 weeks is to pass, essentially, your
bills. I don’t know how we can be much
more bipartisan than that than to pass
your bills.
Mr. SCALISE. Reclaiming my time,
those were not our bills. The House had
a negotiation going on with the Sen-
ate. The Senate, as the gentleman
knows, passed some bills—not all of the
bills that were brought to the House
floor, but brought some bills that were
different from the House bills. As you
know, when the Senate passes a bill
and the House has a different version,
you go to conference committee. You
don’t just say: ‘‘We are going to take
the Senate bill.’’
Also, as you brought that bill to the
floor, the Speaker, the majority leader
brought to the floor as part of that
package a bill that did not pass the
Senate floor, a bill that would have re-
versed the Mexico City policy. That
change was dramatic because that
would have allowed taxpayer money to
go to foreign government entities that
provide abortion.
It has been the policy of this coun-
try, since Ronald Reagan went to Mex-
ico to deliver that speech and create
the Mexico City policy, that we don’t
give taxpayer money to fund abortion.
And I know that has gone back and
forth through different administra-
tions.
This President has made it very clear
that he will strictly enforce the Mexico
City policy. That bill on the floor
would have reversed it. That is not lan-
guage that passed the Senate floor.
In addition to that, if you go back
throughout these negotiations, at the
very beginning, the President has been
talking about a crisis at the border.
The crisis at the border is very real. In
our first meeting with the leaders in
the Situation Room at the White
House, both the Speaker and the mi-
nority leader of the Senate interrupted
the Secretary of Homeland Security
every time she tried to go through this
new crisis that we are seeing.
It is not just the drugs, which are
dramatic and we need to stop. It is not
just the human trafficking, which is
dramatic and we need to stop. It is not
just the murders that are happening.
There are murders that happened in so
many States.
In your State of Maryland, just re-
cently, someone who is in this country
illegally from El Salvador was sen-
tenced to life in prison without parole
in Montgomery County, Maryland, for
the murder of someone, and he had no
remorse for his crime.
We just saw a police officer in Cali-
fornia who was murdered by someone
who came back and forth through this
country illegally multiple times be-
cause we don’t have physical barriers
to secure our border.
So that presentation was inter-
rupted, and we never got through the
full presentation; but ultimately, the
Secretary of Homeland Security has
laid out why we have a crisis at the
border, and it needs to be resolved, and
they went into a detailed breakdown of
costs to secure the border.
So at issue right here, now, is a dif-
ference in amount. If your side truly
does agree that we have to secure our
border, which I have heard the Speak-
er, the minority leader, and others say
they need to secure the border, yet
they haven’t been willing to agree to
more than $1 in the request that has
been made by the administration to se-
cure the border.
So the real question is, at the heart
of this debate, if we are all for border
security, we can talk about border se-
curity.
In fact, back in 2006, President
Obama, when he was a Senator, talked
about the need for securing the border
when he voted for the Fence Act. The
minority leader, Mr. SCHUMER, at the
time voted for the Fence Act. That lan-
guage, the language—and you can call
it whatever you like: a fence, a wall,
cement, steel slats. But ultimately, it
is law, language that allows what can
and can’t be built.
The language that Minority Leader
SCHUMER at the time voted for in 2006
would have given the Department of
Homeland Security many of the tools
they need in language, but not the
money. And so now we are at a point
where, if it is all of a sudden he is
against that kind of physical structure
that he was for in ‘06, he ought to ex-
plain why, and so should others who
have maybe changed their position.
But if the language in 2006 would give
the Secretary of Homeland Security
the tools they need and the authority
they need to actually start securing
the ports of the border that are be-
tween ports of entry—we have ports of
entry, and everybody knows where
those are. And we, by the way, stopped
a lot of really bad people from coming
into our country at ports of entry.
What we don’t know is how many peo-
ple come through the areas where we
have no ports of entry, where we have
no borders.
Everybody recognizes that you can’t
just stop people at the points of entry
and then have no protection in the
hundreds of miles—we are talking
about over 500 miles of unprotected
area of this country on the southern
border where there is a crisis that is
growing every single day.
And if we acknowledge that—now, I
know the minority leader and the
Speaker went on TV the other night
and said it is a fabricated crisis. How
could you call this a fabricated crisis
when you see deaths, when you see over
90 percent of the heroin that comes
into this country and kills Americans
every single day is coming across our
southern border. That is not a fab-
ricated crisis. Those are real serious
things that are happening, that are
bad.
There are good people who come to
this country. America is the greatest
country in the world for letting people
in legally. We let over a million people
into our country legally every single
year, and it enriches our country. It is
a legal process. And there are millions
of people waiting to come to this coun-
try the right way.
So while we recognize that greatness
of our country, we also recognize that
there are people who are bad people
who come into our country every sin-
gle day as well, and we need to have
the tools to secure our border so we
can stop that.
So the real question is: How much
money is the other side willing to sup-
port to actually secure the border?
If the department that is tasked with
keeping our country safe is saying they
need $5.7 billion, if you agree to a
smaller number, if you want to put on
the table a smaller number—it is not
$1, and let’s at least recognize that was
an insult. So if it is not $1, then what
is the amount you will support and put
on the table to start a real negotiation
to solve this crisis?
I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. President, the Gov-
ernment of the United States partially
has been shut down. That is the issue
here. We can have the debate that the
gentleman just discussed—not a word
about opening up the people’s govern-
ment, not a word about 800,000 people
who are not getting their salaries, not
a word of the financial instability that
he is subjecting 800,000 people to, ‘‘he’’
being the President of the United
States. They are being held hostage for
the ransom of doing what they believe
is the right thing to do on border secu-
rity.
However, Mr. HURD says—a Repub-
lican who has more border mileage on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H507

the border than any other congres-
sional district in America—what the
President wants to do is not the right
thing.
Senator RON JOHNSON says a similar
quote. LINDSEY GRAHAM said he
thought it was a bad investment. Now,
he didn’t say it yesterday or the day
before. He said it about a year ago.
Mr. SCALISE. Reclaiming my time,
LINDSEY GRAHAM did say we need to
build the wall. LINDSEY GRAHAM has a
different solution, I am sure, than the
gentleman from Maryland. So let’s be
clear.
And I was speaking to Senator GRA-
HAM last night about this. He wants to
start building the wall. And clearly,
your side has not been willing.
And the President, by the way, in the
meeting in the Oval Office, in the Situ-
ation Room, 2 days ago looked at the
Speaker directly and said: Okay. We
don’t agree even on some of these other
areas of government that haven’t been
open, but if you will agree to work
with me on the wall, I will support an-
other 30 days of keeping all govern-
ment going, even on the areas we dis-
agree, but to open everything up and
continue negotiations on the wall. And
the Speaker said no.
We could have everything open
today, but the Speaker is the one who
is being held hostage by the far left ele-
ments of your party because she is yet
to agree to anything, not putting more
than $1.
She said on TV last week she would
support $1. That is an insult. And I
have yet to see, in any of the meetings
I have been in, her willingness to sup-
port more than that.
And so we could have everything
opened today. That offer has been put
on the table. The President, himself,
has said you can write the definition of
the wall. You can ban cement wall. The
President has already acknowledged he
would be willing to support that. He
would be willing to support a lower
number if you can justify how it se-
cures the border, but that offer has
never been put on the table.
We could end this crisis today. Twen-
ty-one days in is too long. And there is
a solution. But the solution includes, it
is not going to be your way or the high-
way. You can’t say: ‘‘No, we want ev-
erything or nothing.’’ You have got to
be willing to put something on the
table that will secure the border of this
country, or just say you are not for
border security. But you can’t say you
are for border security and then not
agree to more than $1.
I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HOYER. The government is shut
down. There is no excuse for that. But
the President wants his way, and he
has taken 800,000 people hostage, and
the ransom he demands is his wall.
b 1245
NANCY PELOSI has nothing to do with
shutting down this government. We
have passed bill after bill over the last
2 weeks to open up this government.
If the minority whip thinks it is good
for border security not to pay people
who are protecting the border, he and I
differ.
Let me tell you what Mick Mulvaney
said. Now, he wasn’t there last night,
and I talked to Senator GRAHAM last
night. He made the statement that I
just reflected to you.
Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney
said, in 2015—I understand it is not
when he is working for the President,
who is paying his salary—‘‘To just say
build the darn fence and have that be
the end of an immigration discussion is
absurd and almost childish for someone
running for President to take that sim-
plistic of a view.’’
He said that on WRHI on 8/25/15. Look
it up.
The government is shut down. If the
minority whip will look at the record,
we funded more money for border secu-
rity in 2009 than was funded in the next
7 years under Republican control.
They didn’t bring their bill, Mr.
Speaker, to the floor until 111⁄2 months
had passed. But now border security
has to be done right this second or we
are going to close down government,
keep it shut, and keep hostage 800,000
people and millions and millions and
millions of Americans who rely on the
services of government.
A, we are for border security. We do
not want people coming into this coun-
try who are not authorized to come
into this country.
B, we care about crime. We care
about drugs. We care about investing
money to stop drugs coming into the
country and to treat those who are af-
flicted with drugs.
The record reflects that, Mr. Speak-
er. But the record also reflects that the
Republicans have, over and over and
over again, used the shutting down of
government, the taking hostage of the
people’s government, to get their way.
Newt Gingrich did it first for a long
period of time in 1995 and 1996, 21 days.
We are going to surpass that this time.
He did it because President Clinton
said: I am not going to allow you to cut
education spending for the people of
United States as deeply as you want to
cut it.
Then Senator CRUZ came over here
and talked to the so-called Freedom
Caucus and said: Unless Obama agrees
to repeal the Affordable Care Act, we
are going to shut down government.
And they shut down government.
Very frankly, when we tried to open it
up, the minority whip didn’t vote to
open it up. So maybe he doesn’t care
about opening up government, paying
people who are working for the people
of the United States. I don’t know.
Then, just recently, a few weeks ago,
when they came to the end of the fiscal
year, they had not done their job. The
Republicans are in charge of the Sen-
ate; they were in charge of the House;
and they have the Presidency of the
United States.
So we did a CR, and we voted for it
because we didn’t want to shut down
government. Then we came to the De-
cember date to which that CR ran, and,
lo and behold, the majority leader of
the United States Senate sent us over
a bill. It was not our bill; it was a bill
from the Republican majority leader.
It came here under unanimous consent.
Their Republican-led Senate sent it
here, and, lo and behold, the leadership
in the House would not take up that
bill.
Why? The President, who had told
Senator MCCONNELL he would sign it,
changed his mind. Whether it was Ann
Coulter, Sean Hannity, Rush
Limbaugh, I don’t know who the prin-
cipal adviser in that decision was, but
one person communicated: I won’t sign
that bill.
So the Republican leadership de-
cided: We won’t put that bill on the
floor.
They put a bill on the floor—they
said over and over and over again: This
week, we put bills on the floor that
wouldn’t pass the Senate.
They put a bill that they knew would
not pass the United States Senate on
the floor, sent it over there. It didn’t
pass, and government has been shut
down.
The gentleman continues to want to
talk about, can we negotiate? We can
negotiate. The President walked out.
He walked out because NANCY PELOSI,
when asked, ‘‘Thirty days from now,
will you support the wall?’’ said, ‘‘No.’’
The President had a tantrum, and he
walked out. He said: Well, this is a
waste of my time.
This is not a process where the Presi-
dent tells us to do things. As I recall,
Mr. Speaker, the Constitution of the
United States, Article I, says we are
the policymakers; we are the ones who
pass the laws; we are the ones who say
what the executive department carries
out as policy.
So we ought to pass these bills. Then,
yes, we ought to deal, honestly and
openly and together, to make sure the
borders are secure.
The gentleman said the immigration
system does not work; it is broken. He
is absolutely right. The Senate, 5 or 6
years ago, passed a bill, in a bipartisan
way, with over 62 votes, 14 Republicans,
and sent it to the House under Repub-
lican leadership 6 years ago. They have
never brought that bill to the floor. We
have pleaded with them to bring that
bill to the floor to fix the immigration
system. It has never come, Mr. Speak-
er, to the floor of this House.
But what we should never do, we
should never take hostage the govern-
ment of the United States, the employ-
ees who toil every day on behalf of the
policies that we adopt and on behalf of
the American people. We should never
take them hostage and say: If you
don’t do what I say to do, we are going
to keep them in an unpaid status,
working if they are critical employees
and locked out if they are not.
Mr. Speaker, it is very, very unfortu-
nate that we find ourselves in this posi-
tion. I would urge that the Republican

discussion on how, in fact, we accom-
plish the objective we all say we want
to accomplish, and that is to make our
borders secure.
We are prepared to do that, open this
government.
Mr. SCALISE. Reclaiming my time,
Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman is fin-
ished. We will, obviously, have more
time to go back and forth on this, but
let’s keep in mind a few facts.
First of all, the last shutdown of the
United States Government was dubbed
the Schumer shutdown because the
Senate minority leader wanted to force
his way on DACA.
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman for one moment.
Mr. HOYER. Does the gentleman re-
member how long that lasted?
Mr. SCALISE. Oh, it lasted very
shortly because the gentleman from
New York realized he was on the wrong
side of the issue, just like right now
your side is on the wrong side of this
issue opposing border security.
Let’s be very clear what the fight is
about, and it shouldn’t be a fight. It is
a fight because the President has said:
Here is a proposal that my Department
of Homeland Security has brought that
said these are the tools they need to
keep the country safe with a crisis at
the border.
It can’t be denied. I know some on
your side want to deny it. I don’t think
the gentleman from Maryland denies
it. But, clearly, when the Senate mi-
nority leader and the Speaker of the
House go on national TV and say it is
a fabricated crisis at the border, the
American people see what is happening
at the border. We can debate how best
to solve it.
The President, through the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, has put
down a proposal of what it is going to
take. This is not a new idea.
Obviously, the President ran on this
as a front-and-center issue. He not only
ran on it, but he was elected by the
American people as President to carry
out border security and build a wall. It
was part of the national debate.
I know some people on your side
don’t even want to recognize that that
election occurred and the result, but it
happened.
Mr. HOYER. Oh, no. I think there
was an election, and he did raise that
question. As I recall, that is why I am
the majority leader and you are the
minority whip.
Mr. SCALISE. You were not the ma-
jority leader when that happened. He
was elected on that. We were still in
the majority.
Let’s remember why we are here. To
think that this is some new idea the
President is bringing forward is ignor-
ing the history, and let’s go through
some of that history.
Obviously, it was front and center in
the presidential election, and he was
elected in large part on building a wall
to secure our country’s border.
Then we go to the first spending bill
as he was President, and we had a dis-
agreement. There were a lot of things
that we were in disagreement on.
We wanted to rebuild our military,
and we finally came to a 2-year agree-
ment to do just that. It was critically
important to start rebuilding the mili-
tary of this country that was deci-
mated, to give our men and women in
uniform who risk their lives for our
country a much-needed pay raise. We
finally did that.
In that negotiation, the President
wanted and he was talking about $25
billion for full border security, to build
out the full 550 miles that are not se-
cure right now, and they are well iden-
tified. The gentleman from Maryland
knows those areas where we haven’t
built walls. Sure, we have got some
money to build walls. There is about
120 miles of wall being built, wall that
is not all cement. Some of it is steel
slats.
Let the experts figure out the best
way to secure our border. We are not
the architects of the border. Let the
experts be that.
But there is some wall being built,
but not enough, especially in the areas
where Federal law today prohibits wall
from being built.
You want to know how ridiculous
some of the laws are right now that we
are trying to change? Federal law pro-
hibits the President from building
walls in the most cost-effective way, in
the most efficient way. Why would we
have those kinds of prohibitions in
law?
We passed a bill through the House
before the shutdown happened. You
voted no. A lot of your side voted no. I
think all your side, in fact, voted no.
But it was a bill the President would
have signed that would have given him
the tools he needs to secure the border.
It went over to the Senate. The rea-
son it didn’t get to the President’s desk
is not because there wasn’t Republican
support. They have a 60-vote rule in
the Senate.
I can disagree. You might even dis-
agree, I don’t know. I disagree on that.
On appropriations bills, they should at
least let the majority rule so we can
properly govern this country in a more
efficient manner. But they have a 60-
vote requirement.
So the Senate minority, the Demo-
crats in the Senate, all voted together
to block it, and that led to a shutdown.
That bill would have kept the govern-
ment running and secured the border,
but Democrats voted no in the House,
Democrats voted no in the Senate, and
so we have a shutdown.
How are we going to get out of this?
How are we going to get it resolved?
We can talk about hostages. We can
talk about the people on your side of
the aisle who refuse to support any
border security with a dollar amount
behind it. You can use words all day,
but words don’t secure our borders.
Borders secure our border. Walls and
barriers secure our border.
The President has said that you can
call it and define it whatever you want.
He has been very flexible in wanting to
negotiate. But in every one of those
meetings, there has not been a
counteroffer put on the table by your
side.
If we want to resolve the crisis, it in-
volves both sides coming together. The
President is already out there publicly,
in our meetings, saying he is willing to
negotiate and come to a different
place.
You should work with your side to
come up with definitions, to come up
with a different dollar amount. But it
has to end in securing our border. If we
all agree on that, it has to end in the
actual language and dollars to accom-
plish that objective.
The President said: I will give you 30
more days. Even though we don’t agree
on some of these other things, I will
agree to sign that into law, if you will
agree to work with me on the wall.
The Speaker said no. It was the
Speaker who said no, not the Presi-
dent. That is why we are at day 21.
We didn’t even need to be at day 1.
We passed a bill out of the House. The
Senate killed it because every Demo-
crat voted no.
So here we are. Republicans and
Democrats and everybody in this room
know how we can solve this problem,
but it is not by you all sitting there
and saying we only are going to sup-
port a dollar and nothing more. Real
money has to be put on the table to
solve the crisis.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. We could go on and on,
Mr. Speaker. The fact of the matter is
the Senate sent us a bill to keep the
government open. They passed it
unanimously, under Republican leader-
ship. The President said he would sign
it. He changed his mind, and this House
folded. And the Republicans who were
in charge at the time wouldn’t even
put the Senate bill on the floor.
We are not prepared to be bludgeoned
by taking hostage 800,000 people who
work for the Federal Government and
who are not now being paid, some of
whom are working.
b 1300
And, ironically, they are working to
protect the border and to make sure
our planes are flying, to make sure
people who fly on planes are not in
danger.
We want the President of the United
States to open up this government. We
want the Republicans to help us open
up this government. We just passed
four bills that are the Senate bills.
Senator MCCONNELL is not going to
take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer because the
President tells him: I am not going to
sign those bills.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H509
January 11, 2019
Let me tell you something, Mr.
Speaker. I have been a Member of this
body for some period of time, and I
served with George Bush. He was Presi-
dent of the United States, and we had
a Democratic House, and we didn’t
have a shutdown. He signed appropria-
tions bills. We worked together. We re-
spected one another.
I would hope, Mr. Speaker, in closing,
that the whip would, in fact, help us
open up the government, and then we
are prepared to sit down—he knows
me—and talk about how we make our
borders secure and protect our people
and, yes, give humanitarian services to
those who are seeking asylum, running
from violence and mayhem and mur-
der. We are prepared to do that. We
want to do that.
I would hope the whip, I would hope
Senator MCCONNELL, who was quoted
just a few years ago as saying, ‘‘shut-
down is a failed policy’’—shutdowns
ought not to occur. Adults who are re-
sponsible ought not to allow that to
happen, realizing full well that in order
to preclude that from happening, com-
promise is absolutely essential on both
sides.
President Trump is the President of
the United States. We have to work
with him to compromise, to come to
agreement. But there are an awful lot
of Republicans—I quoted WILL HURD; I
quoted RON JOHNSON; I quoted some
other Republicans—an awful lot of Re-
publicans who think the President has
the wrong idea. And, frankly, as Mr.
Mulvaney said during the course of the
campaign, it wasn’t a very realistic
idea.
But, that aside, it is time for us to
open up the government, and then we
will have an extensive discussion, as we
must, as we should, in the best inter-
ests of the American people, to keep
our borders secure and keep them safe.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman. I know that we are
closing this. I do want to go back.
Last year, when the President signed
the omnibus bill to keep the govern-
ment open, at that time he said: This
won’t happen again. He laid down a
marker last year that, okay, he will go
along with a bill that is far short of
what he needs to secure the border, but
he wasn’t going to do it again. That
was a year ago.
So everybody has known that this
issue is going to have to get resolved
because lives are at risk. The Presi-
dent, like we did, took an oath to pro-
tect this country. That is what this is
about. We surely want to open up all
areas of government, but keeping the
border secure is part of that. And so
when the President signed the bill last
year, he said: It is not going to happen
again.
Now, obviously, when we came to
this year, there were some people tell-
ing the President the votes weren’t
there to put the money in place to se-
cure the border. In fact, the now
Speaker, when she was minority lead-
er, went to the White House and told
the President: The votes aren’t there in
the House to fund your request for the
wall.
Mr. HOYER. How many Republicans
were in the House at that point in
time?
Mr. SCALISE. We had over 218, clear-
ly.
Mr. HOYER. You had 240-plus.
Mr. SCALISE. Good for you, and, ob-
viously, things have changed.
But when the minority leader then
told the President the votes weren’t
there to fund the wall, maybe the
President took her at her word and
thought that was an accurate assess-
ment of the House. It turned out she
was wrong. We passed the bill to fund
the President’s request.
The House had a difference with the
Senate. It is surely not the first time
in this country’s history where the
Senate passed one bill that was short
of what we needed to secure the border,
and we came back and passed a bill to
fully fulfill the President’s request to
secure the border. So we ended up at an
impasse not because there weren’t
enough Republican votes, but because
there were no Democratic votes to do
that. And now we are here today.
Let’s talk about quotes. He wants to
quote Republicans. I will quote a Dem-
ocrat. I won’t tell you who it is first.
In 2006, when there was a bill to put
$50 billion in place, over 25 years, for
border security, this Democrat in the
Senate said it will authorize some
badly needed funding for better fences
and better security along our borders,
and that should help stem some of the
tide of illegal immigration in this
country.
That was in 2006, for over $50 billion
for border security, and the Democrat
who said that was then-Senator Barack
Obama. So you can quote Republicans.
I will quote Democrats.
Mr. HOYER. That bill passed, did it
not?
Mr. SCALISE. That bill passed, but it
didn’t put the money there, and that is
why we are here.
And again, he can talk and give great
speeches and say we need $50 billion,
but if you don’t appropriate the $50 bil-
lion, the money is not there to actually
build the fencing that is needed.
Mr. HOYER. Was that bill brought up
in the House?
Mr. SCALISE. And so now we need to
talk about how to fund the wall, how to
fund the structure, call it what you
will. And again, the President, himself,
has said you can title it however you
want. You can ban cement fencing.
But at the same time, what Barack
Obama and CHUCK SCHUMER voted for
in 2006 is the authority to build what is
needed, but they didn’t put the money
there. It is time to finally back up the
word. It is hot air until you put the
money on the table.
So the money has been put on the
table by the Republicans, at least an
offer, backed up with real data of
where the money would be spent to se-
cure this country. There has not been a
counteroffer.
So let’s talk now about the final
issue, and that is adjournment.
I know later today the House will be
voting to adjourn. Last week, the
House, under the Democratic majority,
as you proudly talk about the fact that
you all are in the majority, you all
voted to adjourn. We voted not to ad-
journ.
We should stay here to get this job
done, to finally have a real negotiation
to solve our differences. We can solve
our differences, but we are not going to
solve them by continuing to adjourn
every weekend when we should be ne-
gotiating and getting the government
back open and securing the border.
On this final thought, would the gen-
tleman address the vote, the motion
that will be made later to adjourn that
we oppose?
I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HOYER. The gentleman has a
different concept of negotiating than I
do. If somebody takes somebody that I
care about hostage and says now I want
to negotiate with you, it is not a nego-
tiation. That is a demand. That is a ‘‘if
you don’t do it, I am going to harm
people.’’
When you said the President of the
United States said: This is the last
time I am going to open up govern-
ment, I am going to sign an almost
overwhelmingly supported piece of leg-
islation by Republicans and Demo-
crats—George Bush never did that. I
don’t ever remember Ronald Reagan
doing that or George H.W. Bush doing
that or Bill Clinton doing that. They
did it when it was a close vote, but not
when it was overwhelming that we
ought to open up the government.
As long as hostages are held by your
opponent, you are not negotiating. You
are subject to being demanded, ‘‘Do
what I say.’’ That is not the demo-
cratic process, and it is harming, lit-
erally, millions, tens of millions of peo-
ple in the process in order to get his
way. I have not seen that before.
The other two shutdowns were legis-
lative shutdowns. There is no doubt
this is an executive shutdown, and you
just said it: I will never sign something
like this again unless it gives me what
I want.
Frankly, that is what we saw in the
negotiations over the 3 days we were
there. The last day, of course, was
about a 10-minute day because the
President stomped out.
Mr. SCALISE, all I can tell you is I
share your view of the objective, but
because we don’t agree with the same
ways and means to accomplish that ob-
jective, shutting down government
ought not to be the alternative. The al-
ternative ought to be to keep talking
and getting to a place where I think
you and I both want to get, where these
borders are secure, where people are
not being transported across it for
human trafficking purposes, where
murderers don’t come across the bor-
der.
But there is a surge right now across
our border, and that surge is of mostly

mothers and children seeking asylum,
coming to ports of entry—not across
any fences or borders, coming to ports
of entry. The border guards are telling
us they are turning themselves in.
They want to, because they are seeking
refuge from a country that has pur-
ported to be a country of refuge, that
raises a statue in New York Harbor to
send that message. But we need to
make them known to us when they
come into the country. We agree on
that.
So, rather than all this rhetoric back
and forth, Mr. Speaker, it is a simple
proposition. Senator MCCONNELL has
said, unless the President says he will
sign on opening up the government, he
won’t put it on the floor. That is the
only person who is stopping you, be-
cause we have sent bills.
Mr. COLE of your side said: I don’t
like the bills because they are only
Senate bills. We don’t like them either,
but we like, less, government being
shut down. We like, less, 800,000 people
being put at risk. We like, less, the
anxiety that we are causing our Fed-
eral employees in terms of the finan-
cial stability of their homes and their
ability to put food on their tables and
pay their mortgage and pay their rent.
Surely—surely—we ought to be able
to come to agreement that that is not
what we ought to inflict to get our
way. I hope we open up our govern-
ment.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Maryland.
And when you look at the women
who are coming across through this
trek to try to cross the border, first of
all, asylum has been offered by Mexico
to all of the people as part of that cara-
van. Thousands of people were offered
asylum, work permits—turned it down.
There is a legal way to seek asylum.
It seems to me, if another country of-
fers you asylum and you want to leave
your country, you take the asylum, but
they turned it down. But the women
who are coming over, Doctors Without
Borders has done a study and said that
over 30 percent of the women who are
on this trek have been sexually as-
saulted or worse.
We should all want to address this
crisis. There is a way to solve the cri-
sis. If we talk about hostages, both
sides can use terms. But when the
President of the United States and the
White House look at the Speaker and
say, ‘‘I will sign a bill that contains
things that we have yet to negotiate
that I don’t agree with; I will sign it if
you agree to keep negotiating,’’ and
the Speaker of the House said no, that
is the my-way-or-the-highway ap-
proach that is wrong.
The President has put multiple
things on the table, has offered to ne-
gotiate on terms, on dollars, on every
front, and not one counteroffer. That
has got to change. We can solve this
crisis, but it is going to involve both
sides being willing to put something on
the table to solve the border security
crisis. I hope we can get there, and we
will keep working at it.
I appreciate the comments and the
thoughts of the gentleman from Mary-
land, and I truly do believe that he
wants to solve this. We have some dif-
ferences. Let’s keep working and get it
done.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

SHUTDOWN IMPACT ON CENTRAL
VALLEY
(Mr. HARDER of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HARDER of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to remind Mem-
bers of the everyday faces being hurt
by this government shutdown.
Mr. Speaker, 21 days into this crisis,
the Central Valley has had enough. I
spoke to a woman from Modesto who
drives 30 miles to work every morning
to serve our country as a TSA agent.
She goes paycheck to paycheck, sup-
ports her kids, pays her rent,
healthcare, groceries. She is not get-
ting paid right now, and her daughter
may have to drop out of college be-
cause her mom can’t afford her tuition.
What are we doing?
And it is not just Federal employees.
Farmers in my district can’t apply for
tariff relief because the Farm Services
Agency isn’t open. Because HUD is
closed, I have hundreds of families who
won’t be able to pay their rent and are
worried about being evicted.
This is an unnecessary crisis. The
Central Valley—America—needs this to
stop. I urge everyone on this floor to
put politics aside, to work together,
and to reopen our government.

STRENGTHENING BORDER
SECURITY
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
on behalf of the people of Florida’s Sec-
ond Congressional District who stand
in strong support of the Trump admin-
istration’s efforts to secure our south-
ern border. Unfortunately, obstruc-
tionist leadership on the other side of
the aisle is unwilling to even consider
a commonsense solution to the prob-
lem that hurts the security of our Na-
tion.
This has become a needlessly divisive
issue. We simply must secure our bor-
ders. Despite the steadfast efforts of
law enforcement, human traffickers,
drug dealers, and other violent crimi-
nals continue to enter our country
from the southern border daily. Fur-
thermore, the majority of heroin,
fentanyl, and methamphetamine in
America are smuggled into America
from Mexico.
With the opioid epidemic and drug
addiction costing our economy hun-
dreds of billions of dollars annually,
and taking countless lives, we must
take action.
I stand with my colleagues and Presi-
dent Trump in our commitment to se-
cure our Nation and protect our people.
f
RESTORE FUNDING TO THE U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, this shut-
down is tearing at the fabric of our so-
ciety, and one of the clearest examples
is the lack of funding for the Justice
Department.
As a practicing attorney for the past
30+ years, I know that many people,
when facing some of the most chal-
lenging times of their lives, often de-
pend on Justice Department services.
When we fail to provide those re-
sources, our fellow citizens are forced
to suffer in silence.
This lack of funding has led the Vio-
lence Against Women Act to expire,
jeopardizing protections for domestic
abuse and sexual assault victims. Con-
stituents in my district, who provide
assistance to these survivors through
such fine organizations as Turning
Point of Lehigh Valley, and the Crime
Victims Council, have said that their
programs could soon be at risk.
And because of Washington’s failure
to fund programs like the Victims of
Crime Act Assistance Grant Program,
organizations that look out for chil-
dren suffering abuse aren’t getting the
resources they need either.
As promised, when this shutdown
began, I will be making regular chari-
table contributions to individuals and
agencies in my district who are ad-
versely affected by the shutdown, but
that will, by no means, offset loss of
Federal funding.
Our constituents are suffering, and
they need us to act.

paid, not because they did a bad job,
but because of a temper tantrum from
a President whose first allegiance is
not to the national interest, but to pro-
tecting his fragile ego, and keeping his
racist campaign promise to build a
wall that no one with an ounce of com-
mon sense wants.
The U.S. House has passed legislation
to open the government, pay our em-
ployees and contractors, and get on
with the people’s business. It is up to

REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT
(Ms. STEVENS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to call on my colleagues and the
President to reopen the government.
Too many lives are being impacted.
Too much is at stake. I cannot sit idly
by and watch the impasse that con-
tinues to plague our country. I have
been in constant discussions with my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
come to agreement, but to no avail.
This shutdown is hurting our econ-
omy, causing distrust in our sacred de-
mocracy, and putting the lives of hun-
dreds of thousands of Federal employ-
ees in limbo. This is unacceptable.
There are currently 5,730 Federal em-
ployees in Michigan who are out of
work. This shutdown is seriously im-
pacting our country’s safety and
health.
There are FDA labs in Detroit that
inspect for food and drug safety and
oversee the interdiction of items com-
ing into our country. They must be al-
lowed to continue, this work.
The House just voted on the final ap-
propriations bill to reopen the govern-
ment. I urge my colleagues in the Sen-
ate and the President to put an end to
this for once and for all, and to pass
these bills.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF
BARBARA YAROSLAVSKY
(Mr. TED LIEU of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of
my friend, Barbara Yaroslavsky, who
died on December 26, 2018, at the age of
71.
Barbara dedicated her life to public
service, activism, and supporting her
community in as many ways as she
could find.
Born in Los Angeles on August 9,
1947, Barbara was raised with the belief
that community involvement was the
key to making a difference in the lives
of those around her. She took a special
interest in education and healthcare
issues, championing the welfare of chil-
dren and families.
She also actively participated in the
Jewish community, sitting on several
boards at the Jewish Federation of
Greater L.A., and ensuring the Jewish
community’s voice was heard in gov-
ernment and policymaking.
Additionally, Barbara volunteered
with many nonprofit organizations.
She served on the L.A. Commission on
Community and Family Services, the
California Board of Registered Nursing,
the Advisory Board for L.A.’s Best, and
Friends of the Saban Community Clin-
ic. She was also a past chair and mem-
ber of the California Medical Board.
Barbara and her future husband, Zev
Yaroslavsky, met while he was a hall
monitor at the L.A. Hebrew High
School, and she was at the front desk
of the American Jewish University.
They married in 1971, 4 years before
Zev was elected to the L.A. City Coun-
cil. Zev then vacated it to run for the
L.A. County Board of Supervisors,
where he served for many years.
Barbara is survived by her husband,
Zev, two children, David and Mina, and
four grandchildren.
I hope that Barbara’s family takes
comfort in knowing that her memory
will live on in the lives of people she
helped throughout her life.

CONGRESS HAS A CONSTITU-
TIONAL DUTY TO FUND GOVERN-
MENT AGENCIES
(Mrs. FLETCHER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to urge my colleagues here and
in the Senate to vote to end this shut-
down.
Across Texas, there are nearly 30,000
Federal workers who will not receive
their paychecks today, many of them
still dutifully performing their jobs.
This Congress has a constitutional
duty to fund the government so that
the agencies can do their important
work, the work of and for the Amer-
ican people, and there is much of it.
In my own district in Houston, for
example, this shutdown is delaying our
recovery from one of the most dev-
astating natural disasters in our coun-
try’s history. As Members of this body
will recall, Hurricane Harvey hit Hous-
ton and the Gulf Coast in August of
2017, causing nearly $115 billion in dam-
age.
This body appropriated funds to aid
the recovery from Harvey, but nearly
18 months later, the City of Houston,
and Harris County, still awaits these
funds. And the funds can be distributed
only after the publication of rules from
the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, funds that are des-
perately needed.
The shutdown has delayed publica-
tions of these rules, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote to end the shutdown.
I understand that we have differences over
issues—including the best way to secure the
border—but shutting down the government is
neither a responsible nor reasonable approach
to our differences.
I urge Senator MCCONNELL to take up the
multiple spending bills the House has passed
this week, which Senators approved with a
large bipartisan majority just weeks ago, so
that we can open the government and get
back to work for the people.
f
PASSAGE OF THE EQUAL RIGHTS
AMENDMENT
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.)
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, Democrats in
Washington continue to urge the Presi-
dent to reopen the government, end the
crisis of his own making, and get Fed-
eral employees back to work.
Despite this unfortunate situation
dragging on, we can celebrate good
news out of Richmond, Virginia.
Wednesday marked the first day of Vir-
ginia’s State legislative session. And
on day 1, a Senate committee passed a
resolution to ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment.
Thirty-seven States have voted to
ratify the ERA since it passed Congress
in 1972, two in the last 2 years. Thirty-
eight States must ratify a constitu-
tional amendment, and Virginia could
get it across the finish line.
I am thrilled to witness this energy
to enshrine women’s equality in the
Constitution where it belongs. I hope
my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting this incredible State effort, in
Virginia and elsewhere, to amend the
Constitution to finally ensure equality
for all women and men in this country.

THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IS
HURTING PEOPLE
(Mr. EVANS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, the gov-
ernment shutdown is hurting people in
Philadelphia right now.
I met a HUD employee this week who
is tired of being used as a pawn. She
said: ‘‘I’m ready to go back to work.
I’m ready to serve the people.’’
Instead, she has to worry about her
mortgage and student loans.
She said: ‘‘My American Dream is
slipping through my fingers. It’s really
not fair.’’
Mr. Speaker, she teared up. I under-
stand why.
For the 800,000 Federal workers and
Federal contractors, this is not some
reality TV show. This is real life.
The workers and citizens served by
the government need the President and
the Senate to reopen the government
first, and then we can have a debate
about border security.
The Senate should join the Demo-
cratic House in passing the spending
bills to reopen the government, bills

that they have already passed last
year. And we all need to keep foremost
in our minds that this debate about the

real people and getting to work now,
Mr. Speaker.
f
ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING).
CLARIFICATION OF REMARKS
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Texas for
yielding to me here this afternoon.
I come to the floor here of the United
States House of Representatives with a
specific purpose today, and that is to
address an issue that has become a con-
troversy.
I regret that I made a freshman mis-
take a week ago today when I took a
call from a reporter from the New York
Times, and that was a 56-minute inter-
view, without a tape, that resulted in a
long article. In that article were
snippets of the 56-minute interview.
Part of that inquiry was about the
history of immigration policy in this
country for over the last, say, 18 or so
years, of which I have been a signifi-
cant part, especially in Iowa, as we
have a voice to shape policy and help
these presidential candidates move on
to the Oval Office.
I am grateful that much of the policy
that was debated then is in the Oval
Office today, and it is being debated all
over this country. But one phrase in
that long article has created an unnec-
essary controversy.
That was my mistake, Mr. Speaker,
so I want to start this out with some
context of that discussion, and that is
this: That if you can control the lan-
guage, you can control the policy.
Labels have been hurled in this coun-
try at people like we have never seen in
this history of America. I made a point
of this in a September 12 tweet that I
sent out as a component of this broader
dialogue, and here is the tweet, ver-
batim, Mr. Speaker:
The word ‘‘Nazi’’ is injected into left-
ist talking points because the worn out
and exhausted word ‘‘racist’’ is over-
used and applied to nearly everyone.
b 1330
That is the foundation for at least
part of that discussion with a New
York Times reporter, Mr. Speaker.
In that also was discussion of other
terms that had been used, almost al-
ways unjustly labeling otherwise inno-
cent people the word ‘‘racist,’’ the word
‘‘Nazi,’’ the word ‘‘fascist,’’ the phrase
‘‘white nationalist,’’ the phrase ‘‘white
supremacist.’’
They even are derogatory toward
Western civilization, which is the foun-
dation for the American civilization,
and we are today the flagship.
At this point, I will read the quote
that had brought about this con-
troversy, Mr. Speaker, and this is from
The New York Times article titled:
‘‘Before Trump, Steve King Set the
Agenda for the Wall and Anti-Immi-
grant Politics,’’ which, by the way, is a
bit pejorative, because I have never
been anti-immigrant. I have been anti-
illegal immigrant, and I remain that
way.
But here is the quote. It says:
‘‘ ‘White nationalist, white suprema-
cist’ ’’—and this is from me, by the
way, Mr. Speaker—‘‘ ‘White nation-
alist, white supremacist, Western civ-
ilization—how did that language be-
come offensive?,’ Mr. KING said. ‘Why
did I sit in classes teaching me about
the merits of our history and our civili-
zation?’ ’’
That is off of this article, and that is
the substance of this heartburn that
seems to be churning across the media
in America today.
So I look at that and I think, well,
what was that conversation? It was
about how those words got plugged
into our dialogue, not when the words
became offensive, which is what the
technical interpretation of this is. How
did that language become offensive?
It is, how did that offensive language
get injected into our political dia-
logue? Who does that? How does it get
done? How do they get by with laying
labels like this on people?
When I asked the question, ‘‘Why did
I sit in classes teaching me about the
merits of our history and our civiliza-
tion?’’ that response was strictly for:
Why did I sit in Western civilization
classes to hear about the merits of our
history?
I have never sat in a class at any
time and heard any merits about any
of those other names, including I have
never heard a merit about ‘‘racist.’’ I
have never heard a merit about ‘‘Nazi’’
or ‘‘Fascist’’ or ‘‘white nationalist’’ or
‘‘white supremacist,’’ but Western civ-
ilization has merit, and I remain a de-
fender.
So I put together a statement, which
is public, and I choose to read it into
the RECORD now, Mr. Speaker, and it is
this:
‘‘Today, the New York Times is sug-
gesting that I am an advocate for white
nationalism and white supremacy. I
want to make one thing abundantly
clear: I reject those labels and the evil
ideology that they define. Further, I
condemn anyone that supports this evil
and bigoted ideology, which saw in its
ultimate expression the systematic
murder of 6 million innocent Jewish
lives.
‘‘It’s true that, like the Founding Fa-
thers, I am an advocate for Western
civilization’s values and that I pro-
foundly believe that America is the
greatest tangible expression of these
ideals the world has ever seen. Under
any fair political definition, I am sim-
ply an American nationalist. America’s
values are expressed in our founding
documents. They are attainable by ev-
eryone, and we take pride that people
of all races, religions, and creeds from
around the globe aspire to achieve
them. I am dedicated to keeping Amer-
ica this way.
‘‘This conviction does not make me a
white nationalist or a white suprema-
cist. Once again, I reject those labels
and the ideology that they define. As I
told the New York Times, ‘It’s not
about race. It’s never been about race.’
One of my most strongly held beliefs is
that we are all created in God’s image
and that human life is sacred in all its
forms.’’
All of my life’s work, all of my public
record, all of my bills, all of my votes,
all of my activities support that state-
ment that human life is sacred in all of
its forms and that we are created in
God’s image.
So, Mr. Speaker, I regret the heart-
burn that has poured forth upon this
Congress and upon this country, and
especially in my State and in my con-
gressional district. But the people who
know me know I wouldn’t have to even
make this statement, because they do
know me. They know my life. They
know my history. They know that I
have lived in the same place since 1978.
There is nothing about my family or
my history or my neighborhood that
would suggest that these false allega-
tions could be supported by any activ-
ity whatsoever.
I reject that ideology. I defend Amer-
ican civilization, which is an essential
component of Western civilization.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
from Texas again for the opportunity
to address you here on the floor of the
United States House of Representa-
tives.
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my friend, the gentleman from Iowa,
for his comments. I have traveled with
him, been to different parts of the
country and different parts of the
world with my friend, Mr. KING from
Iowa. I have seen him dealing with dif-
ferent races, nationalities around the
world. And I have had a lot of private
conversations and never seen anything
that indicated anything but condemna-
tion for white supremacists.
But he is a proud American. He is an
American; he is very proud of it. And
he is proud to carry the moniker of
being an American in any situation,
and I would contend that is not a bad
thing.
Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to
the speeches on the floor here this
week. There has been a great deal of
righteous indignation and constant
condemnation for a shutdown. It is
deeply troubling. There are some peo-
ple working who are not getting paid. I
would like to see that fixed.
But President Trump got his answer
this week when he continued to try to
compromise with Senator SCHUMER and
Speaker PELOSI, trying to get a com-
promise.
I was delighted to hear Majority
Leader HOYER mention that we have to
have compromise. It is how things are

supposed to work. I agree with the tone
of that comment, but it is not a com-
promise to say I will give you a dollar
for the border wall when it is such a se-
rious matter, and especially when we
have a history of people making com-
ments on the Democratic side as well
as the Republican side about the need
for border security, the need for either
a wall, a barrier, a fence, but tough,
tight border security for the country,
which is the most generous country,
not only philanthropically. There has
never been a country that has given
more, done more, without any request
in return, but just out of the goodness
of Americans’ hearts, for other parts of
the world. We do that. We care deeply.
But the only way you can have peo-
ple who are giving and who have money
to share and spare is if we have a vi-
brant economy here. Otherwise, Amer-
ica continued the move we saw during
the last administration where the mid-
dle class kept shrinking, the poor got
much bigger, and the rich, well, it is
easiest to put it this way: We have
never had a time in the United States
history, never, when the policies of an
administration would have the effect
that the Obama administration had.
Here is what President Obama ac-
knowledged: For the first time in
American history, 95 percent of Amer-
ican income went to the top 1 percent.
But that is what happens as you
move more and more toward a socialist
form of government. You will have the
rich ruling class, virtually no middle
class, and then you have everybody
equal in the poor ruled class.
That is where socialism goes, and
that is where this country has been
heading as young people have been
miseducated and not been informed
that socialism has never worked. It
will never work. It always leads to to-
talitarianism. You can’t have socialism
without totalitarianism.
One might ask, why do we have so
many billionaires supporting social-
ism, the Democratic cause, the pro-
gressivism, as they call it? Well, it is
because they see themselves being in
the rich ruling class once they get rid
of the middle class. It helps to get rid
of the middle class if you keep bringing
illegal immigrants into the country so
they take the jobs of Americans. But
never forget the cost of that.
Here are some quotes:
‘‘Well, look, I voted numerous times
when I was a Senator to spend money
to build a barrier to try to prevent ille-
gal immigrants from coming in. And I
do think you have to control your bor-
ders.’’ That was Presidential candidate
Hillary Clinton.
She was asked: ‘‘Would you commit
tonight that you would finish the fence
and speed up the construction?’’
And she said: ‘‘Both Senator Obama
and I voted for that as part of the im-
migration debate . . . . We were voting
for the possibility that, where it was
appropriate and made sense, it would
be considered.’’
So she was watering it down already
a little bit from where she had been be-
fore.
But Senator Barack Obama said: ‘‘We
fail to protect our Nation if we do not
regain control over our immigration
system immediately.’’
It is really heartbreaking to hear
people that I like condemn as hateful
and immoral a wall like they have
around their house. The walls of the
houses themselves show that wall
works. The fact that so many people in
this body at night, the last thing they
do, they make sure all the doors are
locked. It didn’t used to be that way.
If you are in a gated community and
you have really tight security in your
gated community, you may not need to
lock your doors. You may feel safe
enough without that. But most will se-
cure their doors, not because a burglar
can’t break through and get into their
home, but because walls work. They
are secure in slowing down people who
would be trespassers, burglars, long
enough, hopefully, for either the police
to arrive or for the homeowner to be
prepared for the burglar coming in.
That is the hope.
I mean, that is why people don’t just
have a roof. They have walls around
their home. People that they don’t
want to come in and interrupt their
families don’t come unless they are in-
vited. That is the way the immigration
system works.
So I would encourage all my friends
who say walls don’t work, go home this
weekend and get a contractor to de-
stroy your outer walls. If you have a
wall or fence around your home, you
have a gated community, tell them, de-
mand, that the walls, the gates, they
all be destroyed and say: ‘‘Walls don’t
work. I have been saying it over and
over on the House floor and in the
media, CNN, MSNBC, ‘Walls don’t
work,’ so I am going to eliminate the
hypocrisy that some could see in my
life. I am going to eliminate the outer
wall of my home, because walls don’t
work. I am not going to have a door
anymore, no walls, because walls don’t
work.’’
That is what needs to happen this
weekend to avoid—some people I really
care deeply about, I don’t want them to
look like hypocrites. I want them to
look fine and upstanding, but you have
to eliminate the walls of your house,
because walls don’t work, according to
you.
The righteous indignation that we
have heard this week and in prior
weeks about the shutdown, I want to
put the focus on people who are work-
ing right now and who may not get
their next paycheck if Speaker PELOSI
and SCHUMER do not at least agree to
some compromise, something, not con-
tinue to say no to a wall, no to a bar-
rier.
Then when he says: Okay, I will com-
promise. It won’t be concrete. It will be
steel. There is a compromise.
They said: Oh, now we see you don’t
have a definite plan.
Well, yeah. He is trying to com-
promise with people who disagree with
him. Fine, but if you are going to com-
promise, you are going to do it with
the President: Okay, I will com-
promise. We will make it a steel wall.
Okay, we will compromise, and we
will have barriers.
Let’s work it out, what we will have.
b 1345
Oh, see, they say: He doesn’t have a
plan. We need to see exactly what his
plan is.
Oh, he has got a plan, but you said
under no circumstances would you
agree. He has been compromising. That
is what it is called. That is what he is
trying to do. And that is what we have
been wanting to do here in the House.
Let’s have a compromise. But don’t say
under no circumstances will you ever
agree to any kind of wall, fence, barrier
and then say: There is our compromise.
That is not a compromise.
And if people would just go back and
look at what they have said in the
past, it will be much easier for them to
reach this compromise: Oh, I forgot I
said that. I did.
And I know they wouldn’t have said
it in prior years if they hadn’t meant
it.
Now, some of my friends across the
aisle are saying, well, we don’t need a
wall. We need a virtual wall: the
drones, the cameras, and that kind of
thing. Well, you also do need a barrier
or those things don’t work.
And, in fact, under the prior adminis-
tration that had, as I recall, about $8
billion to create a virtual wall in sup-
port of securing our border, there was
one little out that they had to avoid
doing any of that, and that was if the
administration declared virtual walls
wouldn’t work, the technology
wouldn’t work. And that is what Sec-
retary NAPOLITANO did.
I can’t find out what they did with
the $8 billion in the prior administra-
tion since they didn’t spend it on the
drones and the technology, but they
declared, in the prior administration,
that that kind of thing doesn’t work,
and so they weren’t going to spend
money on it.
Now they come back some years
later and say: Well, do you know what?
We think we were wrong before. Those
kind of things do work. The tech-
nology, that is what we need.
Why they are saying that now, when
they disagreed some years back, is be-
cause President Trump, who creates
PTSD—President Trump stress dis-
order. They are suffering from the
PTSD, the President Trump stress dis-
order. And now, in that condition, they
are saying: It doesn’t matter what he
wants. We are not agreeing to anything
he wants, period. He has to have total
capitulation, and that is our offered
compromise.
Going back just a little bit again,
you had this comment: ‘‘When I see

tion demonstrations, I sometimes feel

a flush of patriotic resentment. When
I’m forced to use a translator to com-
municate with a guy fixing my car, I
feel a certain frustration.’’
My friends may recognize the name.
That was Senator Barack Obama.
You have another here: ‘‘The Amer-
ican people are fundamentally pro-
legal immigration. . . . ’’
And put me in that category, too.
But he said: ‘‘The American people
are fundamentally pro-legal immigra-
tion and anti-illegal immigration. We
will only pass comprehensive reform
when we recognize this fundamental
concept. . . . First, illegal immigration
is wrong, and a primary goal of com-
prehensive immigration reform must
be to dramatically curtail future ille-
gal immigration.’’
That is what President Trump is try-
ing to do. That is what we are trying to
do.
By the way, that was Senator SCHU-
MER who said that.
We had a President that recently
said: ‘‘I’ll tell you what we can’t have;
it’s these parents sending their kids
here on a dangerous journey and put-
ting their lives at risk.’’
That was President Barack Obama in
2015.
I have several pages of quotes from
Democratic friends who have been sup-
portive in the past of what we are ask-
ing for now. Let’s not play politics
with this. Let’s just help the American
people.
I got a great quote from President
Clinton in his State of the Union back
in 1995, when he felt like the Repub-
licans do now.
Here is a good quote: ‘‘It’s a competi-
tion for space.’’
I don’t buy that, but this is what was
said by a Democrat: ‘‘It’s a competi-
tion for space. Whether the space is a
job, the space is a home, a place in a
classroom, it becomes a competition
for space. This is a country that’s
based on immigration. And we all know
that. . . . And yet, at times you be-
come so overtaxed you have to con-
centrate on saying, ‘The people who
should be here are those who come le-
gally at this time.’ And we’ve got to,
for the time being, enforce our bor-
ders.’’
That was a well-educated Senator
named DIANNE FEINSTEIN on a visit to
the border. And, yes, it was some years
back.
And again, I have got lots of these
quotes. Here is one.
‘‘Do we have a commitment to secure
the border? Yes. What are the options
that we have available to us; let’s
make sure they work. . . . Because we
do need to address the issue of immi-
gration and the challenge we have of
undocumented people in our country.
We certainly do not want any more
coming in.’’
And I agree with Speaker PELOSI
when she said that previously in the
last Democratic majority. That was
made in 2008. That helped the Demo-
crats keep the majority for a second
term.
And now, I think, to put the needs of
the American people behind the desires
of people who want to come in illegally
is a big mistake. You will erode and de-
stroy this country’s ability to be the
most philanthropic, to be a country
that every year produces cleaner air or
cleaner water, like Texas has. You
erode that ability. Because when peo-
ple are struggling financially, the
thoughts of a cleaner environment and
helping others fall behind the desires of
just making enough to feed their fam-
ily. We have seen it throughout his-
tory. It is important to secure our bor-
der.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend
from Florida (Mr. YOHO), a real patriot.
I don’t believe he minds being called a
patriot.
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from Texas for yielding,
who is a great friend of mine.
I think the pictures you have up
there speak a loud picture of the other
side of the 21-day shutdown, of what is
really going on.
Yesterday and today, we have heard
a lot from our Democratic colleagues
about what 20 days was, what 21 days
was. And, yes, there are people who
have been furloughed; and, yes, it is
tragic for them if they can’t pay their
bills. But we know this is a temporary
inconvenience.
We passed a bill today, in this Cham-
ber, that will be signed into law that
these people will be made whole. So it
is a temporary inconvenience, and we
don’t like it. Neither side likes this.
But when you look at the cause of
this, when we go back to the cause of
this—and we saw that meeting in the
White House with CHUCK SCHUMER,
NANCY PELOSI, and President Trump.
After that, there was a press con-
ference where she said not one penny
will go to a wall.
As you have illustrated so elo-
quently, how many times have Presi-
dent—or Senator Obama at the time,
Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator SCHUMER,
and Ms. PELOSI supported a wall, bor-
der security, and the hypocrisy that it
is okay then but it is not okay now be-
cause they want to label it ‘‘Trump’s
wall.’’
What this President is trying to do is
fulfill all of our obligations to the Con-
stitution, to uphold the Constitution
from foreign and domestic enemies.
Border security is something we all
do, border security at our homes. I
imagine 90 percent of Americans lock
their doors at night because of security
to protect their families. Mayors and
police chiefs of towns protect their
citizens. That is their job.
Mr. GOHMERT. Do they secure their
doors and secure their cities because
they hate people who are not part of
their home or their city?
Mr. YOHO. No, not at all. They do it
because they want to protect the peo-
ple whom they have been tasked to do.
That is all we are asking for here is
border security.
So 21 days ago the government shut
down, a partial shutdown: 76 to 80 per-
cent of the government is funded.
There is a small portion that is not
funded.
And again, I feel bad for the people
who have been furloughed, but today,
the legislation passed, as I said, where
they are going to be made whole.
Since 21 days ago, the government
has been shut down, making this the
longest—or we are tying the previous
record for the longest shutdown in U.S.
history?
Why has it been this long? Because
the Democrats refuse to come to the
table and negotiate a solution.
When you have two sides, where one
is willing to work and compromise and
the other one says not one penny, you
are not even at a starting point to
compromise. Instead, they would rath-
er bring up messaging bills that don’t
fund the vital programs. Also, that
they can say: We didn’t support Presi-
dent Trump’s border security.
This is hatred at the highest level,
yet they talk about tolerance and all
this other stuff. They have such a dis-
dain for this President. And again, all
he is trying to do is secure this Nation.
Well, let’s take a look at the last 21
days; on the other side, as you have
brought up here, 21 days.
On average, 2,000 inadmissible mi-
grants arrive at our southern border
daily. This means that in the last 21
days, without a secure border, approxi-
mately 42,000 migrants have sought il-
legal entry at our border without going
through the proper channels.
If they come through the proper
channels, as you said, we allow over a
million people in this country, to im-
migrate here. We have proper channels
for people to come through. But over
42,000 immigrants have sought illegal
entry at our border without going
through the proper channels.
Additionally, in December, 27,518
family unit aliens were apprehended
for crossing the border illegally. If
those numbers remain consistent, that
means over 18,000 family unit aliens
have been apprehended for illegal
crossings in the last 21 days.
In fiscal year 2018, 2,028 illegal aliens
arrested had homicide charges already.
If this number remains consistent, that
is 115 homicide charges for illegal
aliens in the last 21 days.
Further, on an average, 300 Ameri-
cans die per week from heroin. Ninety
percent of all the heroin in the U.S.,
and marijuana and cocaine, 90 percent
of that comes from our southern bor-
der.
Secure the border, Ms. PELOSI.
That means that in the last 21 days,
if we have 300 dying a week—21 days is
3 weeks—that means at least 900 Amer-
icans have died because of heroin ille-
gally crossing our border.
Secure the border, Ms. PELOSI.
This doesn’t even include the amount
of fentanyl that crossed our southern
border in 2017, which the amount that
has come in is enough to kill every sin-
gle American via overdoses.
If you talk to the Democrats, they
will tell you that $5.7 billion is too

much to pay for protection at our
southern border. But what they won’t
tell you is how much more it costs the
Federal Government and Americans by
not securing our borders.
And again, we want to be sensitive to
the people who have been furloughed.
As I said, and I know I am going to
take some heat for this, it is a tem-
porary inconvenience. But for these
people that you have on this picture,
for the countless other people we can
talk about—Kate Steinle in San Fran-
cisco, Mollie Tibbetts, Peter Hacking—
all were killed by illegal Mexicans who
have come into this country, and I find
this very egregious.
b 1400
Peter Hacking, a father of nine, a
blended family, had been married to
his wife approximately a year. He and
two of his children were killed by a
Mexican that came into this country
illegally. That person that killed these
people, a person who should not have
been in this country, got 2 years in
prison. It is a sham that the Democrats
want to use politics to say this is not
about security of this Nation. Ask
those people.
For the people who have been fur-
loughed, it is a temporary inconven-
ience. They are going to be made
whole. But for these people, it is a per-
manent damage, not just to their fami-
lies, but to their communities and to
this Nation.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
for yielding to me, and I will be here if
he needs me to weigh back in.
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Florida. We have
been friends for a long time, and I
know how deeply my friend, Represent-
ative YOHO, cares about this country
and about the people who are under our
charge.
This poster has some more recent
folks. You have heard about Officer
Singh, who was recently killed by a
person illegally in the country. That is
the charge. Pierce Corcoran, 22 years
old, and I was hearing his parents talk
about him yesterday; Justin James
Dennis Lee, 14 years old, a cute kid;
Steven Marler, his family would love to
have him back. Some of these were not
intentional murders. Some of these
were accidents, some by drunk drivers,
and some by negligent homicide, but
they killed Americans.
Grayson Hacking, she was 22 months
old. It is a little harder. Ellie Jean Bry-
ant reminds me of one of mine, killed
when she was 4 years old; Blake Mi-
chael Zieto, he was 20; Chrishia Odette,
13; Rocky Jones, 51.
Now, Dominic Durden’s mother is a
friend of mine, and I know how she has
suffered—she is a single mom—at the
loss of Dominic. He sounds like he was
an absolutely awesome young man.
Then there is Shayley Estes and Grant
Ronnebeck. He was 21.
I got to see a little bit of my friend
Sean Hannity’s show last night and I
saw these names scrolling, and I was
going: Oh, my gosh. Look at those
names. And there is a website his pro-
ducer, Linda, directed me to that they
were using that has lists of names.
There are three columns, in case some-
one can’t see, three columns of names.
This isn’t everybody that has been
killed by illegal immigrants. So know-
ing people who have lost family mem-
bers to illegal immigrant homicides, it
is difficult to absorb the pious, right-
eous indignation that we have some-
times heard here on the House floor
about the shutdown. It sounds like cal-
lousness on this floor, potential cal-
lousness to the murders and the deaths
of so many Americans that would not
have happened if Congress had done its
job.
And it breaks my heart to think of
the murders and the homicides, neg-
ligent homicides and otherwise, that
will occur if we continue to fail to do
our job, which is, I would submit, a
part of our oath.
Our oath is not to protect and defend
people who want to break into this
country illegally. That is not the peo-
ple for whom and to whom we took an
oath.
I have heard from teachers who were
saying: My heart breaks for these
groups of kids that are thrown into our
classrooms that don’t speak English.
But my heart also breaks for the Amer-
ican citizens and legal residents who
are not getting the education anymore
that they would have gotten had we
not had so many illegal immigrants
thrown into the classroom. We can’t
take care of both. We can’t teach them
both because if we try to concentrate
on the people who don’t speak English
that are illegally here—and I am hear-
ing from teachers saying, we are get-
ting them constantly.
We are getting more people, and we
are not prejudiced against anybody,
but we can’t teach them and the stu-
dents who are legally here because
they can’t learn at the same level. So
what happens? The American citizens,
the legal residents, people who are le-
gally here, they are not getting the
education that they would get other-
wise.
I would just submit, before I yield
again to my friend from Florida, this is
a compassionate country. It is one of
the things I am proud about. But I ask
the question, Mr. Speaker: What is
more compassionate? Is it to allow peo-
ple to flood into America illegally
when we know 37 percent of the girls
are being sexually assaulted, normally
multiple times; 17 percent of the young
boys are being sexually molested on
the way, as they are drawn toward the
United States to come in illegally; and
every day another girl is pulled into
sex trafficking that would not be if our
border weren’t so porous.
Is that compassionate or is it more
compassionate, looking at the situa-
tion—and I love Mexico. They have got
some of the most beautiful places in
the world. My wife and I honeymooned
there 40 years ago and we loved it. I got
certified in an hour to scuba dive. It
was a great certification process, and I
loved scuba diving. It was just beau-
tiful. They have got incredible beauty
in Mexico and in Central America.
They have more natural resources
than most countries in the world. They
have got actually a better location in
Mexico and Central America for com-
merce than North America does. They
are between two continents, two
oceans. They ought to be one of the
very top economies in the world. There
is one reason they are not, and that is
the corruption.
Where does the corruption come
from? It comes from the tens of billions
of dollars that Americans pour into the
drug cartels. Because they are getting
money for people coming up here from
human trafficking; they are getting
money from sex trafficking; they are
getting money from the drug traf-
ficking that is going on in the U.S.,
and it is funding corruption.
We have got places where the police
won’t step up because they know they
will get killed like the last ones that
stepped up. It ought to be a top econ-
omy in the world. It ought to have a
burgeoning, huge middle class that is
thriving and doing so well. It is not be-
cause we have a porous border, and we
are funding the corruption in Mexico.
They have got some of the hardest
working people in the world. I know
some. It would be so much better for
the people of Mexico if we would secure
our border, cut off the money to the
drug cartels, and let them become what
they could be if we weren’t funding the
corruption through our porous border.
So I ask my friend from Florida if he
would agree that the compassionate
thing to do is to secure our border, if
our only goal was to help all of the peo-
ple in Mexico.
Mr. YOHO. Absolutely. And we are
going to continue this on—it will be 22
days, 23 days, hopefully, not long, but
we are going to highlight what is going
on. The compassionate thing is—and as
you brought up, this is not anti-immi-
gration. This is not anti-Mexican.
I made reference to three people that
were killed by people from Mexico who
were here illegally. That doesn’t mean
all Mexicans are bad.
I have worked with a lot. I come from
an agricultural background. They are
hardworking people, just like Ameri-
cans are. This is something that if we
don’t have rule of law, you can’t have
a law-abiding society.
I want to address one other point, if
you will allow me.
Mr. GOHMERT. Please.
Mr. YOHO. President Trump has
taken a lot of heat about Mexico pay-
ing for the wall. I talked to the Presi-
dent about this when he was a can-
didate, and I think that is an issue that
we do need to talk about.
When you look at the facts, Mexico,
since 2008, has received $3.2 billion,
with a B, in foreign aid. That comes to
about $320 million a year in foreign aid.
I am a proponent of foreign aid. They
had also started the Merida Initiative

in 2008. Since that period of time, $1.6
billion has been invested into that pro-
gram. That is strictly counterdrugs. It
has been $1.6 billion since 2008, and I
ask you: Is the drug problem today bet-
ter in America or worse?
Mr. GOHMERT. It is worse.
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, it is worse.
So my proposal is that we, as a body,
start looking at rerouting that money.
If 90 percent of those drugs are coming
through legal ports on our southwest
border, in addition to the open, porous
border, would it not make more sense
to secure our borders, whether it is
more screening at the legal entries, but
let’s also take care of the illegal ones.
And so in reality, that money that
was earmarked for Mexico in foreign
aid and drug initiatives, I propose that
we reroute that and let’s do those
things that we know we can do. That
will stop the amount of deaths, the 300
deaths a week that are happening from
fentanyl, or heroin, and then the co-
caine and the marijuana coming in. A
border wall and beefed up border secu-
rity will do that.
And I ask Ms. PELOSI to please nego-
tiate and get off the moral high horse
that you are caving into the President.
This is not a partisan issue. This is an
American issue, and it deals with our
constitutional responsibility.
I thank Representative GOHMERT for
his leadership on this.
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate my friend, Representative YOHO
from Florida, not just for his eloquent
comments, but also for his friendship
and his deep, abiding love for America.
There are three rows of names on
each of these, and these are just a part
of the people who have been killed by
people who came into the United
States illegally.
I would like to go back to the place
I honeymooned with my wife, one of
the prettiest places on Earth, Las
Hadas.
b 1415
For our 25th anniversary we went to
Cancun. But I am not comfortable
going back now. I read recently near
Cancun cartels had some people killed.
I want Mexico to return to being a safe
place to go. There was a time when the
cartels would not do anything like
murder around any of the tourist at-
tractions because tourism was so im-
portant to Mexico. That has gone by
the way. The corruption is terrible.
People who stand up many times pay
with their lives or family members’
lives.
I have heard people here on the floor
say that this is a manufactured crisis
and that, of course, the megaphone
that is used in places like CNN,
MSNBC, and others repeat the same
exact talking points. I don’t have any
talking points here from the President,
the White House, or from Republicans.
This is just coming from the heart and
from the facts.
We are in trouble. This little experi-
ment in self-government our Founders
knew would not go on forever. They
knew it would go on for only so long as
we could keep it. As Ben Franklin said:
It is a Republic, madam, if you can keep it.
I know a lot of my friends across the
aisle think they are acting from com-
passion when they say: let’s leave these
borders wide open, and let’s do a blan-
ket amnesty for everybody who can get
here.
But as someone who has worked in
our legal system, our judicial system,
much of my adult life, I do believe with
all its faults—and there are plenty—it
is the best legal system the world has
ever known.
One of those legal doctrines that has
evolved over the years because it is
fair, it has been deemed to be fair by
Americans, I think it exists in every
State, it has a strange name for a doc-
trine, attractive nuisance.
Mr. Speaker, most Americans know
inherently or through education that if
you have something like a swimming
pool or a really cool playground and
you don’t put a fence around it, then if
someone comes and is hurt in that
swimming pool or drowns or falls in
the playground, or is killed or hurt in
some way, the landowner that refused
to put up a fence or a wall or some-
thing to keep people from getting to
that attraction are held financially lia-
ble, and they have to pay financially to
those who have suffered, or, in the case
of a death, to the family of those who
have suffered. That has been considered
one of the great doctrines of our legal
system.
But thankfully for people here in the
House and Senate, we haven’t applied
that sound doctrine to the fact that
America has become a lure, a draw, and
it is drawing people by the thousands
and tens of thousands and hundreds of
thousands. Some die on the way here
or when they get here. Some are pulled
into sex trafficking, their lives are de-
stroyed.
I have been there so many times
when it is not on their lists of ques-
tions to ask, but many times they ask:
How much did you pay to get into this
country?
The response was 5, 6, 7, $8,000.
Where did you get that kind of
money?
Well, $1,000 here, $1,500 there.
Where are you getting the rest from?
The drug cartels are who get the
money.
They are going to let me work it off
when I get where I am going.
I have watched them hand over dif-
ferent addresses. 2, 3 in the morning,
while the Border Patrol is coming
down and asking the questions, getting
the information; they pass around a
different address.
I have seen them say, basically: Do
you want to claim this child?
No, you claim the child.
Mr. Speaker, you don’t know how
many are unaccompanied and who are
accompanied by people who they
shouldn’t be.
Let’s stop luring people to their de-
mise or to their despair. Let’s continue
to be the most generous country in the
world when it comes to allowing people
in legally, as we do. As my friend, Con-
gressman YOHO, pointed out, over 1
million visas legally a year. Nobody
else does that. China? Russia? Nobody
does that. We do.
But let’s make sure it is legal; that it
is not MS–13 gang members who are
going to repeatedly stab a young boy
or girl and rape women. Let’s make
sure that it is not drug cartels sending
people in.
I hear people say: well, there is not
that much drugs that comes across our
border on the south.
Mr. Speaker, I have been there too
many times, and the Border Patrol will
tell you, down there at 2 and 3 in the
morning: look, they just sent over 20 in
a raft.
You hear it on the radio. They call
all the Border Patrolmen in. They
start processing the people, and as the
Border Patrolmen will tell you, that is
when they send in the illegal drugs.
The two guys who said that we got
pinned down a while ago by a 50-cal-
iber—there is no mistake about that
50-caliber when it is fired—and we were
hunkered down behind the tanks won-
dering what high value individual or
what big drug shipment are they bring-
ing across right now when they know
we don’t have anything that stops a 50-
caliber.
Look, the drugs are coming in. We
have been there when we used thermal
technology—I say, we, it was the Texas
Department of Public Safety that gave
that information by radio to the Bor-
der Patrol. They float up a balloon.
They use their thermal technology.
They say: oh, yeah, we see those two
or three people here. Apparently they
are carrying drugs, some big thing they
are bringing in. Here are 17, 18 people,
they are not carrying anything; they
are clearly just trying to come in ille-
gally.
They would find the people that we
would tell them about as they float up
the balloons and get to zoom in. In the
end, they said: okay, we have got all
the people. We are processing all the
groups that you saw that appear to be
just trying to come in illegally. But
the ones who appeared to be bringing
in drugs, they knew some little way
and they got away, so we didn’t catch
any of those guys.
That goes on every day, every night.
Who dies from those illegal drugs com-
ing in?
The compassionate thing for Mexico,
for Central America, and for the people
to whom we owe our oath, is to secure
the border. Build a barrier where we
have got to have it to secure the bor-
der, and let’s stop Americans dying un-
necessarily, so we can save the right-
eous indignation in this room for those
who have died because we did not do
our job.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JANUARY 11, 2019 No. 6
Senate
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
O God, our way, our truth, and our
life, we worship You. Quicken our con-
sciences by Your holiness, that we will
find nourishment in Your truth.
As this partial government shutdown
grinds on, help our lawmakers to open
their hearts to Your love and to sur-
render their desires to Your purposes.
In this tangled world, we are con-
scious of our woeful inadequacies to sit
in the seats of judgment, to balance
the scales of justice, and to respond
with equity to the myriad calls of
human needs. We need You, Eternal
God, to crown our deliberations with
Your wisdom and with spacious think-
ing to fit these challenging days.
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to
talk about the significance of today,
January 11, the 21st day of the partial
government shutdown.
Today, we tie for the longest shut-
down in the history of the U.S. Govern-
ment. Tomorrow, we will set a record
for the longest shutdown.
Today is the first paycheck day
where 800,000-plus Federal employees
will not be paid. In fact, some have al-
ready started to get their paychecks
because even when there is no pay, the
process of producing the check and the
stub continues. So people get pay-
checks, but there is a zero on the line,
which is sort of like pouring salt in the
wound or adding insult to injury. It is
one thing not to be paid, but it is an-
other thing to be working and then get
the stub and have there be a zero there.
People have already reported—some of
our air traffic controllers and TSA pro-
fessionals and others—that they are
starting to receive those checks.
January 11 is also a time when—I
know what it is like in my family. My
wife and I kind of load up on both the
charitable contributions and buying
gifts for our family in December, and
then that credit card bill in January is
the biggest one we pay all year. Fami-
lies are receiving those.
January tends to be among the cold-
est months of the year, and heating
bills are the highest. We are going to
have a cold snap and maybe a snow-
storm in Washington this weekend, and
those bills will be high.
January 11 is a time when a lot of
families sit around kitchen tables and
write tuition checks for the spring se-
mester for their kids.
It is precisely the worst time to have
a shutdown of this kind that affects
more than 800,000 people and jeopard-
izes their livelihood.
I stand on the floor today to repeat
what I said Tuesday night when many
of us stood here and said it is really
time to end this shutdown. The House
wants to end it. An increasing number
of Senators want to end it by passing
bills that are right here in the Senate,
available for consideration, to reopen
the government and to engage with the
President in a meaningful, short-term,
and prompt dialogue about border secu-
rity and immigration reform.
I wanted to share some of the stories
that are flooding into my office. I will
be back on the floor later because at 11
o’clock, Senator WARNER and I will

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S150 January 11, 2019
meet with Federal employees at a com-
munity center in Alexandria, and I will
be bringing more stories back to the
floor before we adjourn at 1 o’clock
today.
Before I share stories, I do want to
express appreciation to the majority
leader, to the Republicans, and to the
Democrats who joined together with us
yesterday to pass an important bill, S.
24. It is not as good as getting a pay-
check, but it is a bill to tell those who
have lost paychecks or are losing pay-
checks during this time that when we
reopen, they will be paid.
We have done that in the past. Once
we reopened, we figured out a way to
do that. But I felt it was important
that on the day people are not being
paid, for them to at least get the signal
from Congress, some certainty, some-
thing that they might be able to show
to a landlord or to a bank saying: I am
going to get paid.
The Senate majority leader and mi-
nority leader worked at the end of the
day to make sure that a UC to pass S.
24 was successful. It was, and at about
5 o’clock last night, we sent that bill to
the House. My understanding is the
House is taking up the bill this morn-
ing. I also applaud Senator MCCONNELL
for reaching out to the White House
and speaking directly with the Presi-
dent about the bill. The President indi-
cated he would sign it when the bill
gets to him.
Again, it is not as good as a pay-
check, but it adds a little something on
a tough day to tell people that they
can rest assured that when we figure
this out, they will be made whole. I do
want to express my appreciation to all
for working on that yesterday, but,
again, that is not a cessation of the
pain.
I am going to read stories from Fed-
eral employees, but I do want to ac-
knowledge that this is not about just
800,000 employees; it also affects mil-
lions of Americans.
I told a story on the floor Tuesday
night about just coincidentally two
Saturdays ago going to four different
units of the National Park System
under the Department of the Interior
and the National Forest System under
the Department of Agriculture and
being turned away by a gate closed and
a sign saying: We are shut down.
That I was turned away was of no
moment, but I was interested to watch
other families pull up in their vehicles
on a Saturday, spending time with
their kids. Time with the family is pre-
cious. You often don’t get a lot of it.
Sometimes driving with kids a long
way to get to a national park or some-
thing—they are squabbling in the back
seat, and you are really hoping to get
there. Watching families pull up and
looking at their faces as they saw that
what they hoped to do that day they
couldn’t do because it was closed—that
made an impression on me.
People were trying to visit the muse-
ums here in Washington, and they
couldn’t.
Citizens who are falling into hunger,
who want to apply for food stamps—95
percent of the workforce that processes
food stamp applications has been fur-
loughed during this time.
Air traffic controllers are working
because they are essential, but it has
to make you a little cranky to get a
paycheck with a zero on it. I can’t
imagine a Federal employee I would
less like to be cranky than an air traf-
fic controller. I mean, this is very im-
portant stuff. You don’t want an air
traffic controller sitting in that tower
thinking about anything other than air
safety.
If 5 percent of their brain is sort of
mad at this shutdown and 20 percent of
their brain is focused on ‘‘How am I
going to pay the bills?’’—air traffic
controllers have shared that they need
security clearances to do their jobs. Do
you know that if your credit is im-
paired and you start to get hits on your
credit report, that could endanger your
security clearance? In some cir-
cumstances, it could lead to your secu-
rity clearance being taken away. If you
are under a court order to pay alimony
or child support, and you can’t, regard-
less of whether you have a good reason,
and there is a court order forcing you
to, that could lead to your losing your
security clearance.
You don’t want an air traffic con-
troller in the tower worrying about
anything other than the safety of the
passengers. If they are mad at the gov-
ernment for shutting down, and they
are anxious about not getting a pay-
check, and they are wondering about
how long it will go on and what the
consequences might be, that is not
something that makes me feel com-
fortable.
This is an issue about Federal work-
ers, certainly, but it is also an issue
about the effect on Americans who
need all kinds of services.
Like every office here, my office has
been flooded with expressions of con-
cern. They are saying: Senator, why
can’t you do something? What is going
on? How long is this going to go on?
And I don’t have a good answer for
them.
Let me read some stories. I read
seven or eight Tuesday night. These
are stories that have come in since
Tuesday.
Shane from Alexandria wrote:
I am a veteran and furloughed government
employee working for the Peace Corps. My
wife is a disabled veteran, and we live pay-
check to paycheck. I lost my job during the
housing crisis, and we lost our home and
then relocated to the DC area for work. We
have worked hard to build our lives back up
and again own a home. Now, that is all in
jeopardy again! If I don’t get paid, we can’t
pay the mortgage, and we will lose our home.
I relocated my family from Florida for a se-
cure job here and to provide financial sta-
bility to my family. Now, because of a dys-
functional government, I may have to find
new work again, but it may not be in time to
save our home. Please, Please, Please, do
what you can to open the government back
up.
Terry from Fairfax wrote:
I am writing you, along with my two other
elected officials, seeking your help in bring-
ing this government shutdown to an imme-
diate end. Today is day 19—
This was sent to us on Wednesday—
and counting, with no end in sight. The in-
formation put out by the media saying the
number of those affected by this (partial)
government shutdown is 800,000; I submit to
you it is much higher than that—especially
in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Currently, I work for the Department of
Homeland Security, the Transportation Se-
curity Administration at Washington Dulles
International Airport. I have the compliance
department at Washington Dulles, enforcing
the Code of Federal Regulations, and have 15
people working for me. We make sure the na-
tion’s transportation system at Washington
Dulles is secure and safe and are exempt
from furlough.
Of the 15 people that work for me, most all
live paycheck to paycheck. As you can imag-
ine, with the outlook of no paycheck coming
this Saturday, the morale is starting to go
down and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs—
I hope I am saying that right—
is kicking in—that of self-preservation.
Their focus is switching from their work—
keeping things secure and safe—to their fam-
ily and how they are going to provide for
them (survive).
As for me, I served honorably in the United
States Coast Guard and retired after 26
years. I started working at Washington Dul-
les when TSA first stood up and have been
here over 16 years. I am 63 years old. My
Coast Guard retired paycheck is my finan-
cial security, something to fall back on,
something I can plan on . . . up until now. I
just learned yesterday there won’t be a re-
tired paycheck for Coast Guard retirees be-
cause of the shutdown. The financial secu-
rity we worked for is no longer there. This is
a breach of trust between the U.S. Govern-
ment and every Coast Guard retiree, and it’s
wrong!
I have proudly served the American People
for more than 42 years, and I have been
through every government shutdown since
1976. This particular one is getting old in a
hurry, it may be the worst, and it needs to
stop. For my people at work, my family at
home, and my fellow Coast Guard retirees,
we need your help in ending this shutdown.
Garrett, a Virginian working as a
contractor at NASA:
I am a contractor for NASA, I am shut
down, and I am not very happy. This is hav-
ing a negative financial effect on my life. I
am ok today, but soon in the very next few
days when I have exhausted my vacation,
then take leave without pay, then have to
pay for overpriced health insurance; then I
will be in a big pinch. As a contractor we are
not guaranteed to be re-reimbursed for our
leave. The last shutdown I lost a paycheck I
never got back, that was like a 2% pay cut.
I won’t be able to take sick leave or vacation
this year. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE,
and I am relying on you to make it happen.
We all are. Just think of all the good govern-
ment employees that will be forced to leave
the government because it is such a negative
place to work.
Just a comment, government em-
ployees are being forced to leave the
government.
Today in Fairfax, the Fairfax public
school system is having a hiring fair
just for Federal employees. They need
substitute teachers, they need bus driv-
ers, and they need cafeteria workers.
So they are doing the hiring fair to try

to play upon the unhappiness of Fed-
eral employees who are out for the
shutdown and don’t think they are
going to come back to work.
Phil from Chesterfield:
Through no fault of my own I am not being
paid [my] bi-weekly salary . . . tomorrow.
This will cause a significant strain on my
family, my church contributions, my shared
health care cost, my retirement contribu-
tions. Having a college age student attend
Virginia Commonwealth University, with
winter semester fees for tuition and room
and board totaling [thousands in] out of
pocket expenses is extremely frustrating. I
really cannot [go a long time] without a sal-
ary.
Long term policy disagreements (among
both parties of our elected Senators) using
federal government employees’ salaries as a
token to rally off is not Democracy. This is
not fair to You . . . or a career professional
like myself who works for the United States
Government.
I ask you . . . to consider a CR which
would fund our government through a short-
term solution until you and your bi-partisan
colleagues can fix a long-term problem. . . .
Nonetheless, my family and I are out of
funding Now! I ask that you publicly an-
nounce [what you will do] and help lead the
bi-partisan CHANGE TO HELP Virginians.
A family from Loudoun County—one,
a 20-year government employee:
I am scared not knowing when he will get
paid. Our 2 young children should be signing
up for spring sports this week, but we are
cutting optional spending. We are eating out
of the pantry instead of going to the grocery
store. Real people are hurting, working and
not being paid. It is 800,000 but the broader
fear and economic impact is tremendous.
Opel from Hampton:
My name is Opel and my husband Kenny is
an inspector with the FDA. As you know, he
has been unable to go to work for the past
few weeks. I am writing to you to keep our
story and our situation at the forefront of
your agenda. Please continue to push for our
Congressional leaders to get the government
open. It is very difficult to try to explain to
our 9 year old son why Daddy isn’t going to
work, why Mom and Dad are having trouble
paying our bills. This shutdown is wrong and
I feel that it’s also wrong for federal employ-
ees to not be able to go to work because a
person some people elected President wants
an extreme form of ‘‘security.’’ Please Sir,
reopen the government. Many people’s lives
are at stake.
Daniel from Arlington:
I am a furloughed employee in the Depart-
ment of Commerce. My income has stopped.
I have become aware that I will soon be re-
sponsible to make payments for my family’s
healthcare, my life insurance, and other ben-
efits that are normal paycheck deductions.
So now I have no income, plus unbudgeted
expenses.
I have hard decisions now with regard to
paying my rent, paying for my family’s
healthcare, and paying for care for my elder-
ly parents. I have applied for unemployment
assistance. I am trying to find work to sur-
vive throughout the shutdown.
I have 5 years of federal service, and I have
experienced furloughs before. Until now, I
have not needed to take resources away from
the unemployment system. Until now, I
haven’t had to compete in the job market to
take a position away from someone who has
no job at all.
I have personally shut down; I am using as
little gasoline as I can, I am only shopping
for necessities. I’m cutting back in every
money-saving way I can. This is a disheart-
ening way to just try to survive.
PLEASE support legislation that will re-
turn furloughed Federal employees to paid
work status.
A final story, Joie from Warrenton:
My husband is a highly experienced Ph.D.
Economist with the SEC. I am a disabled
(thanks to cancer) Episcopal priest. We are
in free fall not knowing if my husband will
have his job again, and our health insurance
we need for my [cancer]. We need every
penny he earns and no job could replace his
compensation. We spent most of our savings
paying off my $40K in cancer and cancer re-
lated bills last year. Still, we live MOD-
ESTLY in a 1700 sq foot old farmhouse with
no central air/heat, drive one 13 year old car
and . . . [another old] used Subaru. It’s early
Thursday morning 1/10 and I’m having a
panic attack wondering if I will lose my dogs
if we get evicted in case this runs a few
months and we run out of savings to pay our
mortgage. We have no family support or
back up and a son with anxiety and ADHD
issues for which we spend thousands out of
pocket because mental health services for
youth are either unavailable or do not accept
insurance. Please continue to pressure . . .
[all your colleagues] to bring opening the
government to a vote. WORKING AMERI-
CANS need protection!
This is just a sample of the letters we
have received. When I come back from
the session Senator WARNER and I are
doing in Alexandria, I will bring back
more stories. I know that other offices
are receiving these same kinds of in-
quiries. Even with a guarantee of back-
pay, for so many people who live pay-
check to paycheck or who have modest
savings, the timing of even missing one
paycheck is very, very critical.
The House has already taken action
by a strong majority to reopen govern-
ment. By my count, just based on what
folks have said in this Chamber, there
are at least 52 members of this Cham-
ber who have already gone on record
and said we should take up the House
bill and vote to reopen government. My
hope is that when people listen to sto-
ries like this about lost paychecks and
the effect on families and when people
in this body understand the magnitude
of tomorrow’s recordbreaking day,
when we establish the longest shut-
down in the history of the country, as
our colleagues are back in their home
States over the weekend chatting with
folks, that number of Senators—52—
who want to take up these bills and
vote on them will increase and we can
end this suffering that is so unneces-
sary.
I will say this. I definitely get that
there is an important controversy that
needs resolution—talking about border
security, talking about immigration
reform. We have been talking about
these issues since I got here. Regard-
less of your position on how we should
solve them, I think everybody in the
body knows—with no immigration re-
form done since 1986 and border secu-
rity funding a perennial topic—that
there is an important issue to resolving
this: How much should we spend for
border security? What is the right way
to spend the money? What is the right
place to get the money? Can it be done
by executive fiat, or must it be done
via congressional appropriations? What
are the immigration reforms that we
need, having not done an immigration
reform bill since 1986?
When the President says these are
important issues, he is not wrong. He is
right. But as for the idea that even
with an issue of importance on the
table that we need to grapple with,
people who are unconnected to that
issue have to be victims, have to suffer
as we are trying to resolve that issue,
I just don’t get it. As for some of those
who are suffering, it is kind of even
counter to the national emergency or
crisis that the President is talking
about.
For example, the Coast Guard—as
was indicated by one of my stories,
from Terry—is one of the Agencies, be-
cause it is under the Department of
Commerce, I believe, that is shuttered.
They are not a DOD Agency. So they
are not funded. There are 42,000, I be-
lieve, Coast Guard employees. Most are
essential and are working without pay,
but some are furloughed. If there is a
crisis at the border—and as the Presi-
dent described that crisis, a significant
portion of the crisis is illegal drugs
coming across the border, and we need
folks to interdict illegal drugs—why
would we shutter the Coast Guard? The
Coast Guard has many missions, but
one of their important missions—and
they work very well on this, in tandem
with other Agencies in this country
and in other countries—is the interdic-
tion of illegal drugs. How does it make
sense, if there is a crisis at the border
dealing with drug importation, for the
Coast Guard to be shuttered?
So the President’s statement that
this is an issue that needs a resolution
is correct, but punishing people who
are unconnected to the issue or even
punishing some of the very people
whom we need to solve the issue is just
the wrong approach. That is why I be-
lieve the right approach is the ap-
proach taken by the House—bringing
up bills that were bipartisan bills, that
were worked on and voted on either by
Senate committees or on the Senate
floor, and saying: Let’s just do these.
Let’s reach an agreement for the non-
affected Agencies, the nonimmigra-
tion-related agencies, but between now
and September 30 reopen government.
And let’s provide short-term funding, a
month or 3-weeks of funding for the
immigration and homeland security
Agencies, and let’s just make the whole
next chunk of time in this body a dis-
cussion, a resolution, and a com-
promise that will enable us to meet
some of what the President wants and
some of what we want—and that is pos-
sible.
I think sometimes the word that goes
out from a shutdown or the word that
goes out from some of the news stories,
as well, is this: There is not going to be
a compromise that is possible. The
sides are dug in. We can’t find an ac-
cord.
I just want to remind the body—and
the President knows this—that it was

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S152 January 11, 2019
just last February when 8 Democrats
and 8 Republicans worked and intro-
duced a bill that coupled borders secu-
rity with protection for Dreamers. The
President now is asking for $5.7 billion,
essentially, in border security. The bill
we had in February was $25 billion,
over 10 years—$25 billion—which was
exactly to the penny what the Presi-
dent had asked for. It was $25 billion,
borders done right. We wanted to exer-
cise traditional congressional over-
sight in the then-two Republican House
Congress over how the money would be
spent, but the amount the President
asked for wasn’t the problem. It wasn’t
a problem at all—$25 billion in ex-
change for something else that the
President had asked for.
He had said: We shouldn’t protect
Dreamers by Executive order; it should
be done by Congress. There should be a
statutory congressional fix.
He is right about that. That is a bet-
ter thing—to fix it via statute, rather
than to rely on an Executive action
that can change with the whim of each
new Executive. He is right about that.
We basically went to him with a pro-
posal, 16 of us, and introduced the bill:
$25 billion, Mr. President, that is what
you asked for; protection for Dreamers,
Mr. President, that is what you asked
for.
The response from the White House
was not to say: ‘‘I don’t like that deal;
let me give you a counter,’’ or ‘‘Could
you add to it?’’
Within less than 24 hours, the White
House put out a press release attacking
those who put the bill together—even
the Republicans—as proponents of open
borders who wanted to end immigra-
tion enforcement as we know it. It was
a press release from the DHS that read
like it was somebody’s campaign lit-
erature rather than the response that
you would expect from a White House
or a Cabinet-level official.
But what that offer showed is that
there is great willingness in this body
to invest in border security. In fact,
even after the President poured cold
water on it, we put that bill on the
floor for a vote. Forty-six out of 49
Democrats voted for it. Forty-six out
of 49 Democrats voted for $25 billion in
border security, just like more than 50
Democrats in 2013—and I was part of
this, as well—voted for more than $40
billion in border security.
So for folks at the White House won-
dering whether in a 3-week or
monthlong intense discussion we could
find a path forward on border security
and immigration reform, the evidence
is out there that, yes, we can. We can
find that path forward, but we ought to
open up government and let those
unconnected with the dispute at least
go back to work, at least go back to
work and start getting paid. Then, in
this body—which is a great deliberative
body, with 100 people who are very
savvy and smart and who could find a
deal moving forward—we could find an
answer to this that would enable the
President to say he got significant in-
vestments in borders, and it would also
enable those of us who have promoted
commonsense immigration reforms to
feel like there was something in there
as well.
With that, I am going to yield the
floor. I am going to meet with Federal
employees and then return to share
some of their stories. My ask is a sim-
ple one: We need to reopen government.
We need to lift the burden of this anx-
iety over people.
The last thing I will say is, if this
backpay bill passes and the President
signs it—and we are going pay people,
we are going to guarantee their pay—
why wouldn’t we want them to be serv-
ing? If they are going to be paid,
wouldn’t we want to have them serving
Americans rather than not serving
Americans during this time?
With that I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii.
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, this
shutdown is not a negotiation situa-
tion. This is a hostage situation.
For the past 3 weeks, Donald Trump
has held 800,000 Federal workers, tens
of thousands of Federal contractors,
and thousands of small businesses hos-
tage to extort money for his vanity
wall under the pretext of an emergency
at our southern border. Today, hun-
dreds of thousands of hard-working
civil servants felt the pain of missing a
paycheck because this amoral, hostage-
taking President is continuing to
throw a temper tantrum.
Most of us live in the real world,
where paychecks are needed to keep a
roof over our heads and food on our
table. Growing up, my mother was the
sole breadwinner for three of us kids. It
would have been unthinkable, disas-
trous, for our family to miss even one
paycheck from her low-wage job.
When the President says that he can
relate to the hundreds of thousands of
families going without a paycheck,
who does he think he is kidding? Most
people don’t have daddies, as he did, to
bail them out time and again by the
millions.
Enough said about a President who
does not feel your or anybody else’s
pain—we can’t look to him for leader-
ship, moral or otherwise.
One person who can enable the Con-
gress to end the shutdown is Majority
Leader MITCH MCCONNELL. All he has
to do is to bring up the bills that the
House sent us last week—the same bills
that passed the Senate and last Con-
gress to keep government open.
No one needs to remind Senator
MCCONNELL that the Senate is part of a
separate and coequal branch of govern-
ment. The Senate can and should act
without the President’s consent—con-
sent he is currently withholding unless
he gets his vanity wall.
Instead of standing up to Donald
Trump, Senator MCCONNELL is missing
in action, and through his silence and
inaction, Senator MCCONNELL has en-
dorsed another of Donald Trump’s
lies—that there is a crisis at the border
so severe that it justifies taking 800,000
people hostage as leverage for a $5.6
billion downpayment—only a downpay-
ment—for his vanity wall.
Let me be clear. The only crisis is
the one Donald Trump manufactured,
and the only wall that is real is the one
that is closing in on him.
The weekend before Donald Trump
shut down the government, I joined
several of my colleagues on a visit to
Texas, where I saw the real crisis at
the border—the humanitarian catas-
trophe created by Donald Trump’s dis-
astrous immigration policy.
At detention facilities in Dilley and
Karnes—facilities that a top official
from Immigration and Customs En-
forcement Patrol, ICE, callously and
dismissively described as ‘‘summer
camps’’—I saw families locked away,
some for months at a time, without
proper access to legal, medical, or men-
tal healthcare. Many of these families
have access to legal services only out
of the generosity, ingenuity, and hard
work of volunteers and overstretched
nonprofits.
I also visited the massive detention
camp for unaccompanied children at
Tornillo. Tornillo started as a tem-
porary camp for several hundred kids
in June of 2018 after the Trump admin-
istration systematically separated kids
from their parents under its zero toler-
ance policy.
Tornillo has now ballooned to cur-
rently holding some 2,700 unaccom-
panied children, and I note that there
are now an estimated 15,000 unaccom-
panied children in facilities throughout
our country. Since June, the adminis-
tration has already spent more than
$144 million on the makeshift Tornillo
detention camp, where food, water, and
other basic items have to be trucked in
regularly.
I was disturbed to find that thou-
sands of kids are being held in these
soft-sided tents in the middle of the
desert, shut off from the outside world
and the local community. In fact, when
concerned members of the local com-
munity came by to drop off gifts and
items to show these kids that there
were people who cared, the detention
camp turned the community people
away. When I said ‘‘Why would you do
that?’’ it was explained to me that
there were not enough items brought
to give to every child—a pretty sad
reason, in my view.
Most troubling was that there was no
good reason for the prolonged deten-
tion of children at this facility. We
were told that between 800 and 1,300
kids at Tornillo already have sponsors,
such as parents or relatives, lined up to

take them into homes. But the chil-
dren continue to be detained because of
the administration’s policy of requir-
ing all potential sponsors and all
adults in the potential sponsor house-
holds to submit fingerprints, which
would then be information shared with
ICE, thus subjecting everyone to poten-
tial deportation. The chilling effect of
this policy is obvious in the sky-
rocketing length of detention of these
children as fingerprints are obtained
and processed.
Now the negative consequences of
this policy have become apparent even
to this administration, which insti-
tuted the policy to begin with, so the
administration is now easing up on the
fingerprinting of everyone in the
household, but the damage has already
been done.
In 2016, the average length of stay for
unaccompanied children in these facili-
ties was 35 days. Today, the average
has been reported to be at least 59 days
and even up to 74 days. These are kids
who need to recover from the trauma
of coming to this country, not to be re-
traumatized with prolonged detention.
The detention of unaccompanied
children and families for longer and
longer periods is the real humanitarian
crisis facing our country at the south-
ern border, and this crisis will not be
fixed by Trump’s vanity wall.
As if holding 800,000 workers and
their families hostage is not horrible
enough, Donald Trump is now thinking
of taking billions of dollars away from
disaster victims to find a way to pay
for his wall. This is callousness com-
pounded.
Sometimes I find myself totally at a
loss for words as the President keeps
coming up with all of these ways to ba-
sically get himself out of a corner that
he has gotten himself into.
I call on Senator MCCONNELL to use
the power he has to bring the House-
passed bills to the floor—the bills that
we in the Senate passed by voice vote
last Congress to end this shutdown. Un-
necessary pain grows by the day—
800,000 workers go without pay; food
safety is being compromised; our na-
tional parks go unopened or unpro-
tected; air travel can turn into a night-
mare as more and more of the TSA
agents stay home. The list goes on as
we wait for the President to come to
his senses. We should live so long.
Meanwhile, our country is waiting for
Senator MCCONNELL and our Repub-
lican colleagues to come to their
senses.
So, Leader MCCONNELL, everyone
knows you have the power to act. Bring
these bills to the Senate floor. We can
end this shutdown now.
The Senate—if Senator MCCONNELL
will bring the bills to the floor—will
pass these bills because we already did
so. End the unnecessary pain. We don’t
have the luxury of waiting around for
the President to truly feel anybody’s
pain because he is incapable of feeling
anybody’s pain but his own.
We can end this shutdown now. We
can take action on the floor of the Sen-
ate. We can do the responsible thing in
response to the pain that I know we are
hearing from all of our constituents all
across the country.
What are we waiting for? End this
shutdown now.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President,
today marks the 21st day of the gov-
ernment shutdown, an unnecessary and
shameful government shutdown. We
are now tied with the longest shutdown
in American history.
A few weeks ago, the President of the
United States, President Trump, said
he would be ‘‘proud’’ to shut down the
government if he didn’t get his way.
This is nothing to be proud of, and the
harmful impacts of the shutdown are
growing by the day, growing on people
throughout this country who are being
denied important government services,
impacting every American.
We just heard the other day from the
Food and Drug Administration that
they are no longer going to carry out
some of their food safety inspections,
putting at risk the American food sup-
ply for every American. We heard from
the EPA that they are going to be sus-
pending their monitoring of some toxic
pollutants, also having a growing
harmful impact every day on the coun-
try and putting the health of American
citizens at risk. So that is nothing to
be proud of, nor should any of us be
proud of the fact that today marks the
first full pay period in this shutdown
where Federal employees are going to
get no pay. These are civil servants
who go to work, when they are allowed
to, for the good of our country in all
sorts of Agencies, providing funda-
mental services.
Today—I know you can’t read this
document from there—they are getting
pay stubs, and on the pay stubs in the
place where their normal pay period
salary should be, there are zeros—
zeros.
I just arrived on the Senate floor
from a meeting that Senator CARDIN,
my fellow partner representing the
State of Maryland, held in Howard
County, MD. We met with 16 Federal
employees, most of whom have been
locked out of work and all of whom are
not getting any paychecks. We wanted
to bring them together to hear about
the impact this shutdown was having
on their lives and on their families.
The first thing they wanted to talk
about was that they wanted to get
back to work to do the business of the
American people. When they are out of
work, so many Americans who rely on
their efforts are denied the benefit of
their work. So they emphasized the
fact that their No. 1 priority was to get
back to work on behalf of the Amer-
ican people.
We also wanted to hear from them di-
rectly about what the impact was on
them as individuals and their families
because they are now getting a big zero
on their pay stubs.
One of the people we heard from was
Freda McDonald. She works at FEMA,
the Federal Emergency Management
Administration. She has a chronic
medical condition that requires her to
get treatments every week. She said
she has pretty good insurance to cover
most of her health condition, but the
insurance doesn’t cover the cost of her
medication fully, and she needs to get
that on a weekly basis. Then, on a
weekly basis, the copays amount to
hundreds of dollars. So she is going to
be squeezed right away on getting ac-
cess to the medication to treat her
medical condition because she got a
pay stub with a big zero on it.
We heard from Kerri Woodridge. He
works at the Office of Personnel Man-
agement. A lot of Americans don’t
know what that Agency does, but they
are the Agency that has to oversee
Federal employees throughout the sys-
tem. If they are not at work, the whole
system begins to break down. The first
thing he emphasized was the total
waste of dollars to the American tax-
payer in keeping them out of work be-
cause that just creates even more inef-
ficiencies throughout the entire Fed-
eral Government when the Office of
Personnel Management can’t be on the
job. He also talked about the fact that
he is not going to be able to make his
mortgage payments.
There are a lot of Federal employ-
ees—thousands and thousands of Fed-
eral employees, GS–2s and GS–3s, who
are literally one payment from not
being able to make their bills. Now
their pay is not coming in, but I can
tell you their bills are still coming in.
Their mortgage payments are coming
in, their rent payments are coming in,
their medical bills are coming in—all
of those bills are coming in, even
though their paycheck is not.
Mr. Woodridge talked about the fact
that with the upcoming mortgage pay-
ment, he didn’t think he would be able
to make it. He has electric bills. He
spoke very passionately about his chil-
dren because he has a son who has
some special needs, and in order to
make sure his son can perform well at
school, the family has hired a tutor for
that child, and he doesn’t think he is
going to be able to make the payments
to the tutor in the coming weeks. He
said: Well, the Agency said you should
get a lawyer to protect you from the
creditors who are coming after you
when you can’t pay your bills. Mr.
Woodridge had a pretty simple ques-
tion: If I can’t afford to pay my bills,
how can I afford to hire a lawyer to
protect me from the people who are de-
manding I pay my bills on time?

ployee there, an Air Force vet, is some-
one who served his country in uniform

before serving his country in a civilian
capacity for our Federal Government.
Thirty percent of our Federal employ-
ees are veterans. They served their
country in the military, and now they
are serving their country in a different
way as civil servants in the Federal
Government. He said that he had called
the electric company to let them know
that because he wasn’t getting paid, he
wasn’t sure if he would be able to pay
his electric bill on time. Could they
take it easy on him? The electric com-
pany said: We want our money. Sorry,
go find the money to pay the bill on
time.
I don’t know if they threatened to
turn the lights off or not, but people
aren’t going to be able to pay their
mortgages or rents or electric bills or
other bills.
There was another Federal employee
who took a moment out of work. He is
actually not furloughed. He is working
because he is part of the Federal Law
Enforcement Officers Association, and
he has been deemed essential for the
public safety. But he came there to let
us know that when his colleagues,
many of them in the analytics part of
Federal law enforcement—the folks
who collect DNA, the folks who are
tracking suspects, people who are
tracking fugitives—when that whole
part of Federal law enforcement is fur-
loughed and can’t do their job, that
puts those who are on the job and in
the line of duty at greater risk. He said
that it puts their lives at greater risk.
Of course, to the extent that we are
compromising and weakening Federal
law enforcement in general, we are also
putting the public at greater and un-
necessary risk every day.
We heard similar accounts from
other Federal employees who were
there. We also heard from a small Fed-
eral contractor. I am sure that all of us
are hearing not just from Federal em-
ployees but so many small businesses
that provide services to the Federal
Government in places around the coun-
try, and in many cases, they are in
danger of going belly-up.
In order to deal with the shutdown
and the fact that they may not get paid
as a small business by the Federal Gov-
ernment for their services, they also
are laying off their employees. Many of
these are low-wage employees or me-
dian-wage employees. Think about con-
tractors who provide food services to
different government agencies or jani-
torial services. Those employees are
also living paycheck to paycheck. They
have been told not to come into work.
We heard from one that is a nonprofit
called Senior Service America that ac-
tually helps put seniors to work in jobs
around the country. Just a few days
ago, this particular Federal contractor
in Maryland furloughed—laid off—176
of their employees. These aren’t Fed-
eral employees being laid off.
In addition to that, these are Federal
contractor employees who work for
small businesses that contract with the
Federal Government. The negative im-
pacts of this are mushrooming by the
day, harming families, harming com-
munities, and harming all of the others
that also require the economic activity
from either Federal employees or small
business contractors who help at their
restaurants, and that is on top of what
I talked about earlier, which is the
negative impact of the denial of impor-
tant services and health protections for
the entire American public.
A lot of the concerns expressed this
morning by Federal employees also in-
clude the long-term impact. If you
don’t make a mortgage payment on
time, that is going to hurt your credit
rating. In some cases, for Federal em-
ployees who work for National Secu-
rity Agencies, their ability to keep
their security clearance is tied to their
credit rating. When you start having
your credit rating downgraded, it is
going to mean, No. 1, you don’t get
credit, can’t pay your bills, and it also
means, in some cases, that you risk
your entire livelihood, at least in those
Federal Government jobs that require
good credit ratings.
None of this is anything that the
President of the United States or any-
body should be proud of. I do want to
say a word with respect to the contract
employees. Yesterday, Senator CARDIN,
Senator SMITH, Senator BROWN, Sen-
ator KAINE, and many Senators—about
30 Senators—wrote to the Office of
Management and Budget, wrote to the
Trump administration, and asked them
to use their contract authority to hold
harmless those Federal service con-
tract employees who are being locked
out of work through no fault of their
own.
I was pleased that just yesterday in
this body, on a unanimous basis or by
unanimous consent, we passed legisla-
tion that would ensure that Federal
employees were made whole at the end
of the day because they should not be
the ones who are punished for a shut-
down they had nothing to do with.
Senator CARDIN and I and others pro-
posed legislation to ensure that inno-
cent Federal employees should not be
the victims of a political fight they had
nothing to do with. I am hopeful that
later today, the House of Representa-
tives will pass that legislation and the
President will sign it. That, of course,
would remove a big cloud of uncer-
tainty that hangs over the head of Fed-
eral employees who are either working
without pay or furloughed and locked
out without pay.
It, of course, doesn’t deal with the
fact that while Federal employees are
denied a paycheck, they are not going
to be able to make their payments on
time on mortgages and rent, and they
will have a snowballing, harmful effect
from loss of credit rating. There is
other legislation that has been intro-
duced by Senator SCHATZ and I and
others to make sure that Federal em-
ployees aren’t hurt because of their
credit impact or by people collecting
bills, just as we protect servicemen and
women who are deployed overseas to
make sure people can’t come after
them when they are not here and not
able to pay their bills. I hope we will
pass that legislation.
All of this just goes to show that
while Federal employees and the small
business service contractors and a
growing number of communities that
depend on that economic livelihood are
being hit by the day, the big losers are
also, of course, the American people,
both because of the lack of health pro-
tections and services and because, at
the end of the day, taxpayers want to
make sure they are getting services for
their tax dollars.
What are we accomplishing with a
government shutdown? I must say that
when the President of the United
States says he can ‘‘relate’’ to what is
happening, it is pretty clear he can’t,
right?
I don’t know if my colleagues saw the
Coast Guard statement the other day
on how you are supposed to help make
do during the government shutdown.
Here is a recommendation that they
provide. This is step 4 to supplement
your income. They suggest that finding
supplemental income during your fur-
lough period might be challenging, but
here are a few ideas for adding income:
Have a garage sale—clean out your attic,
basement and closets at the same time.
Sell unwanted larger ticket items through
the newspaper or online.
Give me a break. When the President
of the United States says he can relate,
I want to see the President of the
United States hold a garage sale. This
is somebody who goes from Trump
Tower to Mar-a-Lago and back to the
White House. He can’t relate to these
fellow Americans, Federal civil serv-
ants who, when they miss a paycheck,
can’t pay their mortgage.
This is why, just yesterday, Senator
CARDIN and I asked unanimous consent
for the Senate to act immediately on
two bills that came over from the
House to reopen the government be-
cause, yes, this is the shutdown that
President Trump said that he would be
proud to have if he didn’t get his way.
He is certainly the initiator; he is cer-
tainly the protagonist of the shutdown.
But every day that goes by when this
Senate doesn’t do what it can that is
within its power to end the shutdown,
the Senate is an accomplice in Presi-
dent Trump’s shutdown. If we have it
within our power to do our job as a sep-
arate branch of government, then we
should do it. It is not an excuse not to
act because the President doesn’t like
what we propose. Under article I of the
Constitution, we are a separate, inde-
pendent, and coequal branch of govern-
ment.
Last Thursday, as their very first
order of business, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed two bills. The first
bill was H.J. Res. 1. I have a copy of it
right here in my hand. What this bill
does is reopen the Department of

and most effective way to provide bor-
der security in our country. The dis-
pute here is not about whether we need
border security; of course, we need se-
cure borders. We don’t want open bor-
ders. We need secure borders.
The question is, What is the most ef-
fective and smart way to accomplish
that? The Presiding Officer is an expert
on this. I respect the input he has pro-
vided to this body and others. We need
a multilayered approach. But the pur-
pose of H.J. Res. 1 was to say: OK, we
have some differences over the best
way to do that, but let’s not shut down
the Department of Homeland Security
while we debate that. Let’s keep it
open at least until February 8 at cur-
rent funding levels and work that out.
That is what the House sent to the
Senate.
Guess what. With respect to the De-
partment of Homeland Security, it is
identical—word for word—to what this
Senate passed just before Christmas.
We passed it on a voice vote—a big,
overwhelming bipartisan vote. That
vote was to keep the Department of
Homeland Security and other Depart-
ments open until February 8.
What is the justification for not hav-
ing a vote in the Senate on the same
thing that we passed by voice vote just
a few weeks ago? The answer we get is:
Well, the President of the United
States doesn’t agree with it.
Well, that is too bad. We are a sepa-
rate branch of government. If the
President wants to veto that, let him
veto it. Then it comes back here. Under
the Constitution, we would have a veto
override vote. But we shouldn’t be con-
tracting out our responsibilities under
the Constitution to the President. Yet
the Republican leader, the majority
leader, objected to letting us vote
again on the same measure that we
voted on just before Christmas.
Senator CARDIN then offered the
other unanimous consent request yes-
terday. That was to pass legislation to
open up the other eight of the nine
Federal Departments that are closed—
Departments that have nothing to do
with Homeland Security, nothing to do
with border security.
This legislation was also passed by
the House of Representatives on its
opening day a week ago Thursday. Here
is the kicker. The House didn’t take
the numbers that the House of Rep-
resentatives was proposing in the ap-
propriations bills for these Depart-
ments; it took the funding levels the
Senate had proposed on a bipartisan
basis, and the Senate did that on a bi-
partisan basis in two ways.
First of all, the full Senate voted
overwhelmingly—certainly, by a veto-
proof margin—to fund eight of those
Federal Departments through the re-
mainder of this fiscal year—so through
September 30—at levels we agreed to,
first, on the Senate Appropriations
Committee and then by an over-
whelming vote on the Senate floor. The
other measures in the bill the House
passed were measures the Senate Ap-
propriations Committee, on a bipar-
tisan basis, overwhelmingly supported.
The House said to the Senate: We are
going to send you a bunch of bills to
open up the government at levels the
Senate has already agreed to, in a bi-
partisan way, one way or another.
Yet the Republican leader, Senator
MCCONNELL, on behalf of the caucus,
said: No, we are not going to allow a
vote to reopen eight of those nine De-
partments because the President
doesn’t want it, because the President
wants to hold all of those Departments
that have nothing to do with homeland
security hostage until he gets his
wall—a 2,000-mile-long wall.
The irony, of course—and the Pre-
siding Officer knows this—is that the
President’s own budget for this year
was $1.6 billion. That was the Presi-
dent’s budget for this year.
I am happy to sit down—and I know
all of our colleagues are—to work out
the best way to provide border secu-
rity. As part of an overall approach, we
had barriers along parts of our border
long before President Trump was in of-
fice, but we don’t want to be wasting
taxpayer dollars. As I said, even the
President’s budget for this year was
not requesting what the President says
he now needs.
Let’s be straight with the American
people. It is not just $5.7 billion—or
whatever it is—to build a wall. You are
talking about a 2,000-mile-long wall, so
you are talking about $30 billion. What
the President wants to do is to come
back every year and shut down the
government until he gets his next in-
stallment on a 2,000-mile-long wall that
the experts tell us is not the smartest
way to provide border security and is
certainly not the most cost-effective
way.
Let us remember that the President
said this was something Mexico was
going to have to pay for, not the Amer-
ican taxpayer. I saw him on TV yester-
day, when he was down at the border
and was trying to explain away that
campaign promise: Oh, I didn’t really
mean Mexico was going to pay for it di-
rectly; it was going to be indirectly.
That is just not happening. We know
Mexico is not paying for this wall like
the President said. That is why, as its
first order of business, it is important
for the Senate to pass the legislation
that is before us that we have already
supported on a bipartisan basis. Lit-
erally, we have the keys today, if we
want to, to pass the bills that would re-
open the government and send them to
the President. If he doesn’t want to
sign them, at least we will have done
our work as the Senate. We would then
face the question of overriding the
President’s veto to reopen the govern-
ment.
This is where we are now. As I said,
as each day goes by, we have Ameri-
cans who are being denied more and
more services. In addition to the ones I
have already mentioned, I have spoken
to a lot of small businesses that rely on
the Small Business Administration for
their small loans in order to get up and
running, and I have spoken to a lot of
folks in farm country who really rely
on farm service credit and farm center
services. They are being squeezed very
badly.
This is impacting people throughout
the country as 80 percent of Federal
employees actually live and work out-
side of the national capital area, and 80
percent of them are folks like the folks
along the border. There are TSA offi-
cials who are all over the country at
airports, and all of them are being
asked to go to work every day without
pay. They are getting zeros on their
pay stubs like the other hundreds of
thousands of Federal employees.
It seems to me this is the time for us
to act. That is why I have joined with
so many of my colleagues to say to the
Republican leader, to the majority
leader: Let’s do our job under the Con-
stitution. Yes, we know what the Presi-
dent’s position is, but what is our posi-
tion? Why are we unwilling to vote on
two bills that are before us that reflect
the position this Senate has taken on a
bipartisan basis already? How can we
justify to our constituents and to the
people around the country that we are
unwilling to take a vote on measures
that we know have overwhelming sup-
port in the U.S. Senate because we
want to somehow reinforce the Presi-
dent in his own political fight?
I am very hopeful that as the days go
by, the Republican leader will decide to
make sure this body—the U.S. Senate—
does its job as a separate branch of
government and will take up the bills
that will reopen the Federal Govern-
ment, put people back to work for the
American people, make sure Federal
employees who are working get paid
and that those who have been fur-
loughed will have a chance to go back
to work on behalf of the American peo-
ple.
We have it within our power to do it
today. We have it within our power to
do it any day now. I hope we will do
our part to end this shameful shut-
down. By tomorrow, it will be the long-
est shutdown in American history. The
President of the United States may say
he is proud of it, but I hope not a single
Senator in this body—Republican or
Democratic—will be proud to be here
on the day in history when we will
have broken the record for the longest
government shutdown. In my view,
that is a dereliction of duty, and it is
certainly a dereliction of duty for us
not to do our part and use the power we
have to take a vote on the bills that
are at the desk in the U.S. Senate to
reopen the government for the Amer-
ican people.
I see my friend, the Senator from
Maine, is now on the floor. I thank him
for his leadership in this battle.
Let’s do the right thing.
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S156 January 11, 2019
There is no one in this body who is for
open borders.
One of the most troublesome aspects
of this debate that has been framed,
particularly by this administration, is
that you are either for the wall or for
open borders. That is not true. In 2013,
two-thirds of us voted for a very strong
border security provision as part of the
comprehensive immigration reform bill
that passed this body—as I say, by two-
thirds. It was never taken up in the
House. Had it been taken up in the
House, it likely would have passed; the
President would have signed it; and a
lot of these issues would have been be-
hind us.
All of us—everyone here on both
sides of the aisle—support border secu-
rity. What we support is cost-effective,
sensible border security, not border se-
curity that really doesn’t fit the na-
ture of the problem we face and that so
far, anyway, is undefined in terms of
location, design, cost, and all of the
other characteristics of any major con-
struction project that is submitted to
this Congress for its approval.
Again, one of the problems with this
whole discussion is what does the
President mean when he says ‘‘wall’’?
Is it 30 feet high? Is it 20 feet high? Is
it steel? Is it concrete? This has
evolved over time. The biggest ques-
tion is where and how long. Is he talk-
ing about a wall that extends from the
Gulf of Mexico to Southern California,
to the Pacific Ocean? That is about
2,000 miles. Is that what he is talking
about? If so, we should know that.
Then we can debate it as it relates to
other potential options for securing the
border along that distance.
It also should be noted that there al-
ready is a wall, by anybody’s defini-
tion, along portions of that border. I
have seen it. I have been to McAllen,
TX, where the President was yester-
day, and I have seen the wall—a wall.
Yet the questions are, How big is it?
Where is it going to go? How is it going
to be designed and paid for?
One of the reasons the wall is really
not the right solution for the current
problems of immigration starts with
the fact that about 50 percent of the il-
legal immigrants—of the undocu-
mented immigrants—in this country
today are here on overstayed legal
visas. A wall has nothing to do with
these people. These are people who
came in through airports and all other
ports of entry all over the country into
the United States, and 50 percent are
here on overstayed visas. The wall has
zero effect on that issue.
The other principal issue we are fac-
ing at the wall—and this has also been
confused in the news coverage of the
caravans and in the fear that has been
spread—is that the vast majority of the
people who come to the border today
are not looking to sneak across; they
are looking for a port of entry at which
to give themselves up as asylum seek-
ers. They are not illegal immigrants;
they are availing themselves of Amer-
ican law. Once they get to this coun-
try, with their having credible fears of
prosecution or of persecution or of dan-
ger in their home countries, they have
a right to have it be determined wheth-
er they are legitimate asylum seekers.
That is who we are dealing with.
That is who all of those people are.
When you see the pictures of the cara-
vans, they are not headed for a blank
place in the Arizona desert. They want
to go. They want to be captured. They
want to be taken into custody. Then
they can have their asylum claims ad-
judicated. The wall has nothing to do
with them. The wall is a response to a
problem that is decades old but that
has grossly, drastically diminished
over the last 10 or 15 years. For the
problem of people literally sneaking
across the border—entering the coun-
try illegally—all of the data is that the
number is down. It is down about 85
percent from the number of people who
entered the country illegally in 2007,
over the past 10 or 11 years.
By the way, all of the data can be
found in a fascinating document that
was produced in September of 2017,
about a year ago, by the Trump admin-
istration’s Department of Homeland
Security. I can’t remember the exact
title, but it is something like the ‘‘Sta-
tus of Illegal Immigration at the
Southern Border.’’ It is a long report
that is full of graphs. I like graphs, but
I don’t need to hold them up because
all of the graphs have a downward
slope in terms of illegal entries, of the
people who get away, of the number of
people who come in who are recidivists,
who have been here before. They are all
down. So to argue that we are somehow
in a crisis today, when all of the indi-
cators are moving in the right direc-
tion, is really hard to reconcile with
the reality.
The issue I am trying to illustrate is
that the wall is the wrong solution to
the current problem. It may have been
a rational solution in 1985 or even in
2005 or in 2006, when the Congress
passed a major fence law and did in-
crease border security substantially,
but we are dealing with a different set
of problems today that the wall—a
wall—whatever it is—doesn’t address.
I said at the beginning that nobody
here is against border security and
that there may be places where a wall
is part of that. Yet one of the sec-
ondary problems we have is, we have
never been told what this thing—the
wall—is. How long will it be? How big
will it be? How much will it cost? Is it
going to be on private land or Federal
land? We don’t have a plan for what it
is that is actually being proposed that
the government is being held hostage
over.
We don’t know what the President
wants. To say ‘‘I want a wall’’ doesn’t
tell you much. Is it 2,000 miles long or
100 miles long? Is it 20 feet high, is it a
fence, is it a 30-foot high concrete wall
or something with steel slats, which
seems to be the design of the day?
We don’t really know what it is. If
the mayor of Bangor, ME, went to the
city council and said ‘‘I want to build
a new school, but I am not going to tell
you how many students are going to be
in it; I am not going to tell you where
we are going to build it, and I am not
going to tell you what it is going to
cost; just give me a blank check to
build that school,’’ the city counsel of
Bangor would laugh Her Honor out of
the hall. It wouldn’t even think about
doing something like that. No city in
America would do something like that.
Yet that is what we are being asked to
do here today.
We are essentially being asked for a
blank check—well, it is a check for $5.7
billion, but that is a downpayment.
The real estimate is for what they
think the President wants, which is
more in the $20- to $25-billion amount.
That gets me to my final point before
I talk about the impact of this in
Maine. Let’s say that we could settle
this, this week. We could negotiate
with the White House—which is not
easy to do because their position
changes day to day—and say: OK, it is
going to be 100 miles of wall; this will
be the size; this will be the design; this
is the agreed-upon cost. Let’s say we
could do that. If we do that in the con-
text of the government being shut
down, we are inviting this to happen
again.
Next year, we will just have more
budgets. We have a debt ceiling debate
coming that is very important for the
future of the country, for the econom-
ics of the country, for the soundness of
our economy. We have budgets coming
next September. If this works, if this
shutdown that has been initiated by
the President works as a tactic to get
a portion of his wall, he will do it next
time. That is why the age-old principle
is, you don’t negotiate with hostage-
takers. Why? Because if you do, the
next time, they will do it again. Then
this will become a normal and routine
tactic between this President and, per-
haps, future Presidents and the Con-
gress that puts us in a position of being
totally—where we have to choose be-
tween a government shutdown and the
pet project of whatever and whoever
that President is. That is a very dan-
gerous path for us as a deliberative
body, particularly as a coequal branch
of the U.S. Government.
I have talked in sort of global terms,
but this is hurting Main Street Amer-
ica. We have heard today and we have
heard on the news and we hear all the
time about the effects on the fur-
loughed Federal workers, which are
very real. Today is the day that they
don’t get their check. Here is the prob-
lem: You can shut down and stop peo-
ple’s checks from coming, but you
can’t stop their bills from coming—
their mortgage payment, their
childcare payment, their automobile
insurance, their homeowners insur-
ance, their heating bill, their medica-
tion, their food. All of that has to be
paid for.
We can say: Well, we know they will
make adjustments. That is a pretty

hard path to put people on. That is a
heartless path. These people are being
used as pawns, as hostages, in a policy
debate that has nothing to do with
them.
One of the easiest solutions would be
for us to pass the six bills that the
House has passed and that we passed,
which funds 90 percent of the govern-
ment. Why should the Department of
Agriculture be caught in the crossfire
of a debate over a wall in Texas? Why
should park rangers be caught in that?
Why should the Coast Guard be caught
in that?
This is having a real effect. Aside
from those Federal workers, of whom
there are about 1,000 in Maine on fur-
lough right now, there are all the con-
tractors that serve these government
Agencies. We passed a bill last night
that is going to ensure that the fur-
loughed Federal employees will eventu-
ally be paid. That doesn’t say anything
about what they are going to have to
do about penalties on late mortgages
and those kinds of things that they
can’t pay now. But there is no help for
the contractors that are going to lose
total income during this period, and
some of them will be threatened with
going out of business.
It is not just the 800,000 workers na-
tionwide; it is thousands and thou-
sands—tens of thousands—of people
who depend on those Agencies for the
work that they do, that they provide to
the Federal Government.
Let’s talk about effects in hometown,
Main Street America—in places all
over Maine. In Portland, for example—
I will chuckle because it sounds like
‘‘Oh, this is no big deal’’—one of our
most growing industries in Maine is
beer. We have over 1,000 people em-
ployed in the craft brewing industry. It
has been a growth industry. Yet many
of the brewers are being stymied be-
cause they can’t ship their beer across
State lines without approval of their
labels from the Food and Drug Admin-
istration. That is held up.
We have a merger or an expansion of
a brewery in Southern Maine that is
held up because they can’t get their
permission from the tax and trade bu-
reau, from the ATF. These are the
kinds of things—the services that
should be provided—that aren’t occur-
ring. The Portland Press Herald re-
ported on the breweries.
The Portland Press Herald also re-
ported on a developer who has a project
to develop a real estate project in
Maine and can’t get an SBA loan. The
SBA is shut down. That is going to
hold up the project and could even
cause the deal to fall through.
The Bangor Daily News reports that
a family is stuck in the middle; they
have moved out of their house, antici-
pating a closing on a new house with
an Agriculture Department loan guar-
antee that is now stuck, stranded.
There is no action, nobody to answer
the phone. They are living out of boxes.
They are caught in the middle.
These aren’t Federal employees.
These are good Maine people who relied
upon the daily activities of the Federal
Government occurring, which ought to
be just simple common sense. Yet they
are caught without a place to live.
The Ellsworth American newspaper
in Ellsworth, ME, an award-winning
weekly newspaper, reports about a
smokehouse that does smoked salmon.
They were getting ready to reopen and
hire people. They got people on staff,
and, all of a sudden, they are dead-
stopped because the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration can’t act to approve their
licenses.
You can say: OK, this little smoke-
house can survive. The family will find
a place to live, but if you multiply
these examples by thousands and mil-
lions, you are talking about a really
substantial effect on real people’s lives,
and there is no excuse for it.
If this were over some major life-or-
death policy issue, it would be some-
what understandable, but this is an
eminently negotiable problem. It is not
a crisis but a problem. I don’t argue
that it is not a problem and that the
southern border doesn’t need to be se-
cure—again, that is where I started—
but the question is, How do you do it
right? How do you do it in a way that
makes sense to the American tax-
payer?
There may be places where we need a
wall, but the wall is $200 million a
mile. There may be ways to do it for a
fraction of that and provide equal secu-
rity. There also are ways—for example,
with better screening devices at the
ports of entry—to deal with drugs.
By the way, all of the data from the
DEA, the current administration’s
Drug Enforcement Agency, is that the
principal source of drugs coming across
the southern border is at ports of
entry, hidden in cars, hidden in trucks,
not over, through, and around some
place in the middle of the desert. That
is where the drugs are coming through.
That is where we ought to be concen-
trating. That is where we ought to be
putting the technology—more dogs,
more technology that can detect this
type of thing, not building a wall that
doesn’t address the current problem. It
is a solution, but it is going after the
wrong problem.
These are real-life impacts. It doesn’t
need to be this way. If this were a
project being proposed by the mili-
tary—a new BOQ at Fort Benning—it
would come to this Congress. It would
go to the authorization committee.
The plans would go to the Appropria-
tions Committee. We would review it,
question the sponsors, determine if it
were an appropriate expenditure of
public funds, and either approve it or
deny it or suggest some alteration.
This wall has never gone through that
process. We are basically abdicating to
the administration a major decision,
particularly about public expenditure,
without meeting our responsibilities.
One really simple way to get out of
this would be for us to vote by two-
thirds to pass the budget that we voted
on 98 to 2 several weeks ago. It has $1.6
billion in it for border security, by the
way. We could pass that and then sit
down and talk with the administration
about just what it is that they want
and what is reasonable and how do we
do it in a sensible way, and then we can
get this thing done.
What worries me is the posture that
the Senate is in today is adding a pro-
vision that isn’t in the Constitution.
The Constitution says that the Presi-
dent can veto a bill. What we are say-
ing here, now, through our inability or
unwillingness to bring a bill to the
floor is that the President can stop a
bill simply by saying he doesn’t like it.
That is not what the Constitution says.
It doesn’t say that the President has
the right to stop a bill he doesn’t like.
It says that he has to veto it. If he is
going to veto it, fine. Then we can dis-
cuss it, debate it, and determine
whether that is an appropriate veto.
But by avoiding the responsibility of
considering this legislation, we are es-
sentially handing the President a mas-
sive power that I don’t believe Presi-
dents should have.
This is an important issue. It is one
that should be considered. It is one
that should be debated. I would like to
see the administration given the oppor-
tunity to make its case for the spe-
cifics, not the case generally about
criminals or drugs—many of those
claims have been refuted—but a spe-
cific case: Here is what we want to do;
here is the effect of it; here is what it
will cost; and here is why this is the
best solution, as opposed to other solu-
tions, like a fence or more Border Pa-
trol agents or more technology or
drones or sensors or whatever. We are
not being given that opportunity.
I am perfectly willing to debate that
in good faith. I don’t dismiss out of
hand that a wall may make sense in
certain areas, but I am not prepared to
give this administration a blank check
for some construction project when I
don’t know what it is they want to
build.
I am also very reluctant to concede
anything in the context of a hostage
situation where the U.S. Government
is being held hostage because of a
project that the President wants to
build. If we do this, this will become
the go-to tactic for this administration
and probably for future administra-
tions. We will have established a prece-
dent that will haunt this institution
for years to come. That is one of the
reasons I think it is just imperative
that we not cave in to this kind of at-
tempted intimidation and express our
good-faith willingness to look at, work
on, and try to establish the right role
for all parts of border security, not put
all of our chips in one area that I be-
lieve will be both ineffective—not cost-
effective—and damaging to our other
efforts to actually secure the border
and protect the American people.

from my colleague from Maine. I ap-
preciate so much of what he has said,
the reminder to us all to be acting in
good faith here.
I would like to just take a few mo-
ments this morning to say: Count me
in. Count me in to be operating in good
faith. Count me in as one of the many
in this body and the many around this
country who want to ensure that we
have strong borders in this Nation,
that we have true and meaningful bor-
der security, whether it is at our south-
ern border or whether it is at our
northern borders, whether it is our bor-
ders on land or whether it is our bor-
ders on sea.
Count me in as one who is prepared
to deal with the difficulties, the true
humanitarian issues that we are seeing
on the southern border today with an
influx of children and families, those
who are seeking asylum, those who are
frustrated with our system. Count me
in as one of those who want to address
these issues. But also count me in as
one who says that shutting down the
government is not governing. Nobody
is winning in this.
I have been reading all the accounts
that are out there in terms of whether
people think this is on the President,
whether this is on the Democrats,
whether this is on the House. Do you
know who it is on? It is on the backs of
all of us, of the men and women who
are the Federal workers, who work
hard, who get up every day and do the
jobs we have tasked them to do, some
of whom are furloughed, some of whom
are working without pay, but all of
whom are worried about where we are.
We are now in the longest shutdown
we have seen. I think it is either today
or tomorrow that we will pass that
benchmark. It is not just Federal
workers who are being impacted; it is
those of us who rely on the services of
those who work in our Agencies.
I come from a State, as does my col-
league from Maine, where fisheries are
a significant issue for us. NOAA and
some of these other Agencies have a
great deal to do with the economic
health and well-being of our State
right now. This is our big crabbing sea-
son. This is the time of year where
there are a lot of folks out there on the
water who need to be able to provide
for their families—their livelihood.
You think it is all about looking for
the crab at the bottom of the Bering
Sea. Well, in order to do that, you not
only have to have certain permits, you
have to have the ability to unload your
load at the dock with certified scales.
Not necessarily in the crab fisheries,
but in other fisheries, you have to have
observers on your boats. One of the
things we are learning is that the ob-
servers need to be checked out after
their trip. They have to be checked out
before they can move to another vessel.
You have kind of a ripple effect that is
going on out there. So if you are a cod
fisherman or a crab fisherman and you
are thinking: The government shut-
down doesn’t mean anything to me—it
doesn’t until it does. Our reality is
that there is impact, and I understand
that it impacts us in many different
ways.
Every morning, I check in with the
folks who are answering my phones
here in Washington, DC, along with
staff back in Alaska, and I ask, what
are we hearing from folks back home?
I will tell you, I have a lot of people
saying: LISA, you have to stand with
the President. You have to stand
strong on this because we need to have
border security.
Then I have an equal number who are
saying: Please, please do something to
help reopen this government. We ex-
pect it of you. We need it from you. We
are begging you to make things work.
Fix it back there.
I think about where we are right here
and right now. There have been some
suggestions out there that we don’t
know how long this is going to take,
but we just have to hunker down, and
you are just going to have to figure out
how you can make ends meet.
We have some great credit unions in
the State of Alaska that have put out
notices that say: If you are concerned
about how you are going to make that
mortgage, make that car payment, pay
your landlord, come to us and talk to
us. I so appreciate that, but I also
know that many times, that is limited
in its application.
This suggestion that I have heard by
some that, well, you can just go out
there and get a second job—I come
from a State where we have the highest
unemployment rate in the country
right now, or maybe we are now second
from the bottom, but there are commu-
nities where there aren’t a lot of op-
tions.
Our Coast Guard base in Kodiak is
the pride and joy of the Coast Guard.
We have a lot of coasties who serve us
in Alaska—about 2,500, and that is sig-
nificant for us. But in the community
of Kodiak, if a military spouse or a
Coast Guard spouse says ‘‘I have to find
a job because my husband isn’t getting
paid, and we are not quite sure when it
is going to come,’’ in Kodiak, it is pret-
ty tough to find a temporary job.
One of the things we have learned is
that, you have a situation, OK—the
Coast Guard is required to show up,
and we so appreciate that. We so appre-
ciate the work of the Coast Guard.
They are out there in the Bering Sea
right now. They are helping those who
are dealing with some pretty extreme
conditions. Every day, they put their
lives on the line for us. So the fact that
they are not protected at this point in
time causes me great concern and anx-
iety and stress, as it does them as well.
But think about it. You have a situa-
tion where non-exempt employees are
those who are providing childcare at
the childcare center. So you are still
going to work and not getting paid, but
now your childcare center is not open.
Think about these real-life applica-
tions, and then think about the very
easy answer: Well, go out and find
something to tide you through. So I
asked my team back here—I said: Wait
a minute, you could go out and you
could drive Uber. Well, if you are a
Federal employee, you can have sec-
ondary employment, but in order to en-
sure that there is no conflict with your
Federal job, you have to get permission
to do so. So if you are in the middle of
a shutdown and if your Department is
shut down, where do you go to get per-
mission to get that secondary job?
Where do you go to ask for permission
and say: I want to drive Uber for the
next however many weeks until the
government opens. There is nobody
there to give the approval.
It seems like this, where we can say
back here in the Halls of Congress:
Just hang tough. Just be strong. Just
talk to your landlord. We are all going
to get through this together.
We want border security. I want bor-
der security. I think the President’s re-
quest for a comprehensive view of how
we address this is not something that
is so unreasonable. Let’s figure that
out. Let’s walk through it.
I was part of a group this week who
was suggesting, let’s take the proposal
that the Acting OMB Director sent to
the chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, and let’s treat that as a re-
quest for supplemental appropriations.
Let’s have that hearing. But in order to
do this, we have to get our colleagues
on the other side to sit down and go
through this process with us. So maybe
we can get a short-term reprieve. Let’s
do a short-term CR to allow us to proc-
ess this. But let’s not keep the govern-
ment shut down while we do this. We
can figure out these things.
Everyone is talking about leverage—
it is all political leverage. Well, tell
that to the people who are really wor-
ried right now.
We had a pretty tough earthquake on
November 30 that a lot of folks are still
digging out of. They are writing checks
to contractors because they need to
make sure they are going to have a
boiler to get through a cold winter or
make sure the foundation in the home
they want to get back into—that they
are going to get back into it sooner
than later. But what do you do if you
are not sure if that paycheck, which
was supposed to come today, is coming
today or coming 2 weeks from now, and
you have written the check to the con-
tractor? There is a lot of anxiety out
there.
I hear from a lot of these folks who
are dealing with unexpected household
expenditures after that earthquake. I
shouldn’t say it is just after that earth-
quake; we just had another one yester-
day, 4.7. This is the fourth earthquake
we have had since the first of this year,
January 1, that has exceeded 4.0. So we
had the big one, and then we have had
thousands afterwards. So we are still
dealing with a lot of this stuff. When
people hear that the requests for
FEMA assistance or for small business
assistance may be delayed because the
government is not open—think about

how we are compounding their stress,
their anxiety.
I have been part of groups who have
talked to the Vice President, have
talked to his negotiating team. I my-
self have raised these issues with the
President. I want to be part of the solu-
tion, and I want to be part of the solu-
tion sooner rather than later because
we owe it to the people of this country
to function, and when the government
is shut down, partial or otherwise, we
are not functioning.
Let’s stop talking about who has le-
verage and who doesn’t have leverage
and when that is going to tip to advan-
tage the other side. Let’s do what we
need to do when it comes to ensuring
the security of our Nation and our bor-
ders. Let’s navigate those issues. But
let’s not hold hostage good men and
women who are working hard to keep
us safe every day through the basic
functions of government.
I am one who has signed on I think to
most of the bills that are out there
that would help alleviate some of what
individuals and their families are see-
ing, whether it is the Pay Our Coast
Guard Act, the End Government Shut-
downs Act, the Pay Excepted Personnel
Act. But those are simply bandaids,
and quite honestly, they are probably
nothing more than messages right now.
What I am hearing from folks is,
keep us secure, protect our borders,
deal with humanitarian issues, but
allow our government to function. Go
to work, stop arguing about who is
winning, and let’s get the government
open.

Mr. KING. I can’t leave the floor
without complimenting the Senator
from Alaska for her usual thoughtful
analysis and constructive approach to
dealing with this issue. I am proud to
serve with the Senator on the Energy
and Natural Resources Committee. She
has brought the same wisdom to the
floor today that she does to the work
of our committee. I simply wanted to
acknowledge that and thank her for
her comments.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend
from Maine. I enjoy working with the
Senator as well.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Ms.
MURKOWSKI). The Senator from Wis-
consin.
Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I
rise to speak about President Trump’s
shutdown and the real pain that it is
causing in my home State of Wisconsin
and in communities across this coun-
try. The Trump shutdown is now in its
21st day, tying the longest Federal
Government shutdown on record.
Today is also the day that approxi-
mately 800,000 Federal workers will not
get their regularly scheduled pay-
checks, including approximately 3,000
Wisconsinites. Many of these workers
are doing their jobs without pay: Coast
Guard workers, Transportation Secu-
rity Administration agents, air traffic
controllers, along with Federal law en-
forcement, including FBI and DEA
agents.
These hard-working Americans are
suffering because President Trump and
Republicans in Congress refuse to sup-
port bipartisan legislation to end this
shutdown and reopen the government.
We should be working today to pass
bipartisan legislation to end this sense-
less and useless shutdown and reopen
the government. Sadly, no votes are
scheduled today by the Senate major-
ity leader, meaning that the Trump
shutdown will continue.
The House did their job and passed
bipartisan legislation to end the Trump
shutdown, but Senator Majority Lead-
er MCCONNELL has thus far objected to
bringing up this legislation in the Sen-
ate. In fact, yesterday, I joined many
of my colleagues on this Senate floor
in an effort to pass, once again, bipar-
tisan legislation to reopen the govern-
ment, but Majority Leader MCCONNELL
blocked our efforts, and the pain will
continue for so many across this coun-
try.
Why is the government shut down?
Over the past 3 years, President Trump
has publicly promised well over 200
times that Mexico would pay for his
wall. Now he has shut down our govern-
ment over his failure to keep his prom-
ise. He even said that he takes pride in
this Trump shutdown.
The American people shouldn’t pay
for this deception, and Congress should
not make taxpayers pay billions of dol-
lars for his wasteful and ineffective
wall. What we should do instead is re-
open the government and pass bipar-
tisan Homeland Security legislation—
supported by both Democrats and Re-
publicans—that provides smart and
cost-effective border security.
President Trump’s shutdown has
many consequences, and he has created
many victims. I want to speak about
some of the pain Wisconsinites are feel-
ing.
In Wisconsin, the Trump shutdown is
hurting farmers and rural commu-
nities. It really could not come at a
worse time. Wisconsin lost over 600
dairy farms last year and over 500 the
year before. In response, Congress
worked together on a bipartisan basis
to pass a farm bill that would support
our farmers and our rural economy.
Unfortunately, with this shutdown,
President Trump has threatened all of
that progress. His shutdown is stalling
the implementation of the bipartisan
farm bill and delaying things like sub-
sidy payments and loans that farmers
need to get ready for the spring plant-
ing season and plan how they will en-
dure in these very uncertain market
conditions.
We have heard from farmers about
the pain the Trump shutdown is caus-
ing them. Here is one story. Michael
Slattery is a grain farmer from
Manitowoc County, WI. He is waiting
on $9,000 that the Department of Agri-
culture agreed to pay him to com-
pensate him for the losses from the
President’s trade war and for conserva-
tion efforts that he participates in on
his farm.
Mr. Slattery planned to use this
money to get ready for the upcoming
planting season, but now that is all on
hold. To quote Mr. Slattery: ‘‘We are
being played the stooge.’’
He is right. Farmers like him have
suffered enough under this administra-
tion, and the Trump shutdown is an-
other blow for Mr. Slattery and farm-
ers like him across Wisconsin and the
entire Nation.
I have also heard from Kelly. Kelly
lives in Black River Falls, WI. Kelly
has a disability, and she also takes
care of a grandchild with a disability.
Kelly received funding from the De-
partment of Agriculture, including a
program that specifically helps low-in-
come and underserved people in rural
communities. The USDA had agreed to
help her close on a home and to help
her make some immediate home re-
pairs. Now the funding is on hold. She
can’t pay the contractor who made the
repairs, and she is also having trouble
paying the mortgage on her new home.
What is the Department of Agri-
culture doing to help or assist Kelly?
Right now, nothing. She can’t even get
information from the USDA because of
the Trump shutdown.
People like Kelly and Michael should
not have to suffer because President
Trump broke a promise to make Mex-
ico pay for an ineffective border wall.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S160 January 11, 2019
Democrats and Republicans agree that
President Trump should end his shut-
down and accept bipartisan legislation
to fund the Department of Agriculture
and reopen other Agencies in the gov-
ernment.
In fact, the House passed bipartisan
legislation just yesterday to fund the
USDA and reopen it for business. Un-
fortunately, the Senate majority lead-
er is blocking that legislation too.
I am calling for a vote in the U.S.
Senate on the House-passed legislation
to fund the government, which Senate
Republicans previously have supported
and would reopen the Federal Govern-
ment and finally end the Trump shut-
down. We should pass this legislation,
and the President should sign this leg-
islation so that this shutdown ends for
people like Kelly, people like Mike,
people in rural communities, and all
communities across Wisconsin.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I
would just like to take the floor to sort
of continue comments that I began at
10 o’clock this morning. I left at 10:30
to accompany my Virginia colleague,
Senator WARNER, to a roundtable with
Federal employees at a community
center in Alexandria, and I just want
to share some of their stories.
What Agencies did these employees
work for? There was quite a variety—
Department of Homeland Security, De-
partment of Justice, Environmental
Protection Agency, FAA, air traffic
control, various groups within the Ag-
riculture Department, Chemical Safety
Board, Department of Labor, and im-
migration officials. So they were from
many different parts of the government
affected by the shutdown.
How did they describe the effect of
the shutdown on them? These were al-
most all employees who were fur-
loughed and their spouses and children,
in some instances. A couple of them
were not furloughed, but they were
deemed essential and were working
without pay.
How did they describe the choices
they are having to make?
‘‘I paid this month’s mortgage pay-
ment, but I am not sure I can pay the
next.’’
‘‘I am a diabetic, and I have to decide
which of the medications I can afford
this month.’’
‘‘My kid is in college. I am not sure
I can make the entire tuition payment
for the spring semester.’’
‘‘I have had to take money out of my
IRA to cover my bills and pay a pen-
alty for doing that. I am being penal-
ized because the shutdown of govern-
ment leaves me no other choice than to
dip into retirement savings that are
part of my IRA.’’
‘‘I have had to borrow money from
family and friends.’’
‘‘I have had to reduce the money that
I pay to help my mother rent her
apartment.’’
‘‘I tried to put my 7-week-old daugh-
ter on the Federal health insurance
plan that I get because I work at the
Department of Justice, but because I
am furloughed and the HR department
is furloughed, when I tried to put her
on the Federal health plan, I wasn’t
able to do that, and when she needed
medication—thankfully, for nothing
life-threatening—I was not able to get
that covered by insurance. I finally
worked for a while and was able to find
a workaround for it.’’
So families described all kinds of
ways that they are trying to cope and
all kinds of effects that this is having
on them.
I was struck by a common theme: I
work for the government because I love
serving people. I love serving the
American people. That is why I chose
to do what I did. That is why I moved
from somewhere else to come here.
That is how I met my wife or my hus-
band, and we are jointly committed to
public service.
Many of them described: This was
sitting on my desk the day that I left,
and I am so anxious that it is still
there and undone.
For one of the individuals who works
with the FAA, his job includes certi-
fying helicopter pilots who fly to sup-
port the American military mission in
Iraq. He said: I had a big sheaf of those
sitting on my desk when I left the of-
fice. These are people who support our
military mission, and they are not get-
ting certified, and they are not getting
authorized to do the work as long as I
am furloughed.
Another man talked about his pas-
sion for the food stamp program. He
worked with the Ag Department, and
he is involved in one portion of the
SNAP program that is certifying new
grocery stores to take SNAP benefits.
He indicated that in his unit, which is
all furloughed—because 95 percent of
workers supporting the SNAP program
are furloughed—there have now been
2,500 grocery stores that have been ap-
plying just in this short window around
the country to be able to accept SNAP
benefits. Often there are food deserts
where it is hard for people who have
SNAP benefits to find stores in their
neighborhood that will accept SNAP.
There are 2,500 applications stacked up
just in the 3 weeks of the shutdown.
He talked about his anxiety: I have
got to get back to work to process
these so more places are more acces-
sible to those people who have food
needs.
That passion for serving the public is
what is driving them.
One woman indicated she had a great
job in Colorado but was able to get an
internship with DHS. So she moved her
family from Colorado to Woodbridge,
VA, for an internship, and that intern-
ship then turned into full-time work at
DHS, and she said how proud she is to
be working at Homeland Security and
how challenging it is to have no pay.
The employees talked about the psy-
chological damage of being deemed in-
essential. Who is essential and who is
inessential? Why is it that 95 percent of
the people who work on the SNAP pro-
gram are inessential? Is it that we
don’t think hungry families matter?
Those who are applying for SNAP bene-
fits when they fall into a situation
where they need food—that is not es-
sential? Why is that not essential?
A lot of the discussion around the
table was that, as painful as it is to be
deemed essential and have to work
with no pay, being told that you are
nonessential is kind of even more of a
‘‘dis’’ to you. So this was a powerful
group for testimony.
I just want to conclude. I know Sen-
ator WARNER is a slower driver than
me. So I got here before he did. He will
be the last to close this out.
Just the last thing, I got handed pay
statements. I brought back—I don’t
know—maybe 100 of these, and I am
sure not going to read them all, but it
is interesting.
Robert, for the pay period January 5,
2019, which is the pay period when the
check comes in today: net pay, zero.
Jadyne, same pay period: net pay,
zero.
Jared, same pay period: net pay, zero.
I saw this one. I really liked this one.
Bryan, same period: net pay, 1 cent—1
cent.
These are mostly from air traffic
controllers. In my speech earlier this
morning on the floor I said: Is there
any group of Federal employees that
you would less want to be angry at
work than air traffic controllers?
If you think about it—and somebody
shared this with me—if you are there
in the tower working on air traffic con-
trol, you want 100 percent of your mind
to be on keeping everybody safe. What
if 5 percent of your mind is on ‘‘I just
got this pay stub, and it is giving me 1
cent, and I have been working and
working overtime’’—if that is on 5 per-
cent of your mind and another 15 to 20
percent of your mind is, ‘‘How am I
going to pay the mortgage payment?
How am I going to pay the babysitter?’’
One mother told me: Because I am
furloughed, I am not paying the baby-
sitter, and now I am not paying the
babysitter for 2 weeks and that is af-
fecting her. But I am saying: Please
don’t take another client. You have
been my regular babysitter for a long
time. I am not paying you this week, I
am not paying you next week, and I am
not paying you as long as there is a
shutdown because I am at home, but
please don’t go find other work because
I want to go back to work and I want
to hire you again.
But what babysitter can take that
gig—week after week after week not
being paid on the hope that this person
might come back to work?
But for some reason, of all of the in-
dignities, these things really, really
stick in folks craws, because it is not
as if, when there is a shutdown, they
don’t get a paycheck or stub. In some
ways, that might be better than work-
ing full time and finding this paper on

your desk or in your email or at your
house—$41.75 or one penny.
So Madam President, I know I am
preaching to the choir in this group
here, but I just hope as people are back
home this weekend and they hear simi-
lar stories, they will realize that immi-
gration reform and border security are
really important, and we have work to
do to find some accommodation that
both Congress and the President can
accept, but there is no reason to keep
government shut down and sending out
paychecks for 1 cent and inflicting all
these various harms on folks while we
figure that out. I would just pray that
we stop this shutdown and reopen gov-
ernment.
With that, I would like to yield the
floor to my colleague from Virginia.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
Mr. WARNER. Madam President,
first of all, I want to thank my good
friend and colleague from Virginia,
Senator KAINE, for appropriately say-
ing to the balance of the Senate yester-
day that this is not business as usual
and for objecting to our going into re-
cess as 800,000 Americans—many of
them who are working as we heard ear-
lier this morning, many of them work-
ing overtime—are getting paychecks
that have zero on them.
Senator KAINE has probably already
outlined where he just came from. I
want to give the same comments, and I
want to also thank the Chair because I
know she has come to the floor as well
and raised concerns.
We have a lot of debates in the Sen-
ate. There are legitimate policy dif-
ferences we have, and part of our job is
to resolve those. Part of our job should
never be to shut down the enterprise of
the greatest government in the world,
the United States of America.
I think about Mr. Trump, who has
spent a bunch of time going on TV and
running to the border. My goodness, I
just wish that Donald Trump or some-
one from his White House could have
sat in the room that Senator KAINE and
I just sat in with 16 Federal employees
and just heard their stories.
What we heard, virtually from all of
them—and I am sure Senator KAINE
has already acknowledged this—is the
fact that they viewed public service
and serving the government as a noble
calling. I heard many of them who had
been in the Air Force, Army, or Navy
and who had served in our Nation’s de-
fense but felt they were continuing to
serve when they joined public service.
We heard another person who works
in one part of the government that I
am a little familiar with—frankly, not
that much—that does investigations
into chemical spills. It is a small, tiny
agency of 40 professionals. There was a
chemical spill in Houston 1 week ago,
and no one has done any investigation
about what the effects of that spill
might be on that community. She was
there saying that somehow she doesn’t
feel like her job is nonessential.
We heard from a young man who had
moved to Virginia just a few years ago
and bought a House. He thought he
could get through one more mortgage
payment. He helps to approve food
stamps and the grocery stores that
apply to take in food stamps. I think
he said there are 2,700 grocery stores in
this period that are in the process of
trying to get approval to take food
stamps and haven’t gotten approval.
To say to him that, somehow, making
sure folks in this country get food is a
nonessential job was both insulting
and, frankly, a little bit demoralizing.
To hear, as well, from—I can’t recall
which organization he works for—
someone who was saying he understood
that as a Federal employee, when he
came and joined the Federal workforce,
he gave up his right in many ways to
organize and to strike, but he felt like
he gave up those rights but the deal
was that the government was going to
pay him for his job. In many ways,
what is happening right now, kind of in
labor terms, is that, effectively, the
government is locking out our work-
force.
I don’t want to steal Senator KAINE’s
thunder. He may have mentioned this
comment, but I thought it was telling.
We had a number of air traffic control-
lers there, and these folks are not only
working without pay, but many of
them are working overtime without
pay. With our air traffic controllers,
about 35, 40 percent of them are at the
eligible age of retirement today. They
could throw it in, cash it in, and say:
We are done.
One of the things about the shut-
down, as well, is that we have been
working for some time with Paul
Rinaldi, the head of the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association. I
would advise any Members who would
to talk with him because he can scare
the dickens out of you about the safety
of our air system. We have had a chal-
lenge for the last decade of making
sure we replace those air traffic con-
trollers. Well, the next class of air traf-
fic controllers is shut down.
Senator KAINE made mention, and I
think Mr. Rinaldi made the point: Do
you really want an air traffic con-
troller who is working an 80-hour week
with overtime to not be spending 100
percent of his or her focus on keeping
the skies safe but probably spending 20
percent of his time thinking about pay-
ing the mortgage and another 15 per-
cent of the time thinking about wheth-
er he can pay his kid’s tuition? Is that
really what we want from folks who
are tasked with such an important job?
Now, due to the good work of Senator
KAINE and others and the Presiding Of-
ficer, we passed—I think, 2 days ago—
an act so that all of our Federal em-
ployees are going to get reimbursed. I
think the House has passed it now, as
well, and the President has signed it.
Let’s not presume, by any chance, that
this is going to make everybody whole.
We heard from a lady this morning
who had not saved very much but had
done what we all urge and had put
some money in an IRA. She is taking
her money out of the IRA and paying
the tax penalty of getting that money
out so she can get by. She gets a back
paycheck but that doesn’t replace the
tax penalties she pays on her state-
ments.
We have another person who took an
advance on his credit card. We know
credit cards have value, but those rates
are not cheap. If you take an advance
against future pay from your credit
card, and if you get your back pay,
that is not going to make up for those
penalties.
Again, Senator KAINE may have men-
tioned this already, we in Virginia—
and I know Alaska has the same
issue—have tens of thousands, if not
hundreds of thousands, of workers who
are contractors who, even when we re-
open the government, have absolutely
no guarantee that they will be reim-
bursed. As a matter of fact—again,
Senator KAINE may have mentioned
this already—there was a veteran-
owned small business contractor that
had about nine employees that this
week is probably going to shut down
because he can’t pay his workers. He
maintained as long as he could, but he
couldn’t continue to pay his workers.
What about the folks who are never
going to get the hours back who work
providing food services or cleaning up
our buildings and who are the lowest
paid employees—oftentimes contrac-
tors who are never going to get those
hours back—who are going to be stuck
with Christmas presents but never get
the income from that time?
The list goes on and on, and it is not
just Federal employees and contrac-
tors. Alaska and Virginia are both
blessed with great heritage sites, great
national parks. There is the Shen-
andoah Valley, and around where Sen-
ator KAINE lives, there are a lot of bat-
tlefields around Richmond. I am sure it
is the same in Alaska. There are a lot
of private businesses that are the res-
taurants, campsites, and other facili-
ties that may not be on national park
grounds, but they get all their business
from tourists who come, oftentimes,
during the holiday period. Those folks
get, even when we reopen the govern-
ment, goose eggs.
So I thank the Presiding Officer. I
thank my friend from Virginia as well.
I believe we will find a way to get
this government reopened. My hope is
that our colleagues, when they are
home this weekend, will be refreshed
by hearing from workers who are doing
their jobs without pay, and we will find
a way to get this government reopened.
But we should be very clear about the
damage that has been done—the dam-
age that has been done in terms of how
Americans view all of us, regardless of
where we are on this policy—and how
Americans view our Federal Govern-
ment and how the rest of the world
views us now that we have this shut-
down that I believe by tomorrow be-
comes the longest Federal Government
shutdown in American history. I hope
and pray that we all—maybe in the

aftermath—step back and find a way to
make sure that people who pay undue
financial penalties because, through no
fault of their own, the government
shut down are compensated; and that
we can sort through the complicated
issues around contractors and those
private businesses that are around Fed-
eral facilities; that we try to come to
some kind of joint agreement, that
never again will we use an unconnected
policy issue to hold hostage 800,000
folks who work for us and hundreds of
thousands of others—and, frankly, mil-
lions—who depend upon these services
going forward.
I may be being overly optimistic that
somehow or other we will get this re-
solved. If we do, we ought to find—
those of us who are part of the groups
that find common accord—to put some
marker down to never ever do this
again.
I have stories from a variety of Vir-
ginians here. I know the Presiding Offi-
cer wants to get out of the Chair at 1
p.m. I ask unanimous consent that
these statements be printed in the
RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
Rebecca in Chesapeake writes: ‘‘. . . I just
want my husband to be able to go back to
the work he loves and to have stability for
my family returned . . . The stress of not
knowing how long this will last is eating at
both my husband and me.’’
Here’s what Chad, furloughed NASA engi-
neer from Suffolk, told me: ‘‘I’m dis-
appointed to once again find myself barred
from doing the job that I love. I find the re-
cent executive order to freeze civil servant
pay at 2018 levels, while on furlough no less,
to be shockingly disrespectful and wrong.’’
Rosemarie in Falls Church shared this:
‘‘My husband was diagnosed last week with
advanced lung cancer and now on top of that
stress, I have to worry about not getting a
paycheck . . .’’
Lisa in Arlington writes: ‘‘I am forced to
look for multiple part-time jobs to make
ends meet and my savings will soon run out.
Creditors and landlords have only so much
patience with us.’’
Here’s how Joanna from Woodbridge put it:
‘‘I love my job, but being a pawn for those
who have no compassion for me or those I
work beside is going to drive me and many,
many others out of public service.’’
Mr. WARNER. As somebody who has
been in the private sector longer than
the public sector, like my friend the
Senator from Virginia, we both had the
honor of being Governors of Virginia.
We have both been in executive posi-
tions. We have both been in positions
where we had workforces. As a business
guy, you could tell how well the busi-
ness would do by how you treated your
workforce. That is the most important
asset you have, your human capital.
If we think back on the past decade,
we found ways, appropriately so, for
our military to get funded. We found
ways, I think irresponsibly, to dra-
matically cut our taxes, particularly
for folks at the top. Every time we had
to try to make cutbacks. Where we
made cutbacks has been in what we
call domestic discretionary, which in
English are things like the TSA, like
air traffic controllers, like the Agri-
culture Department, like the Coast
Guard, and each year, whenever we find
short cuts, we cut those programs.
As a matter of fact, domestic discre-
tionary spending is at the lowest per-
centage it has been since the 1960s. So
we asked all these folks who were fur-
loughed or being asked to work with-
out pay, we asked them to do more
with less, which isn’t great for the
workforce morale.
Now we have a White House—and, my
gosh, I wish somebody from the White
House could have sat there today. I
would have loved for them to try to ex-
plain how they ought to go back and
negotiate with their landlords about
the rent due, or how they ought to
make do with a side job, or how they
ought to do, as some folks were doing,
as I was going to report—some Vir-
ginians are selling their personal pos-
sessions on eBay to pay the bills. The
fact that this White House is willing to
go to the border for a political photo
op—the President’s words, not mine—
or get on television and blast his polit-
ical opponents but not be willing to
send anyone from this administration
to sit down and listen to the concerns
of our Federal workforce is disgraceful.
I again thank my colleague from Vir-
ginia for his great work on this. I think
it is appropriate that we are in session
today raising these issues. Think of the
level of angst that is going to take
place over the next 48 hours as more
and more people get those paychecks
with zero on it. We haven’t seen any-
thing yet. The kind of angst we felt in
Virginia, in Maryland, and the Dis-
trict, people will feel all over the coun-
try.
We need to bring this government
shutdown to an end. We need to put our
workforce back to work, and we need
to make sure the services they provide
are being applied in a way to make our
country safer and find a way to make
sure that never ever again will we use
these folks’ lives as what they are
being used right now—their words, not
ours—political pawns. They are more
important, their jobs are more impor-
tant, their lives are more important
than the way they have been treated
over these last 21 days.
I yield the floor.

IN CELEBRATION OF CENTRE
COLLEGE’S BICENTENNIAL
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 11, 2019
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Centre College in Danville, Kentucky,
which is celebrating its bicentennial this year.
Officially chartered by the Kentucky Legisla-
ture on January 21, 1819, Centre has been an
important institution in the Danville community
and in our Commonwealth for the last 200
years.
What began as a small Presbyterian college
with only two professors and five students,
Centre has grown into one of the top liberal
arts schools in our country. Given the name
Centre to reflect its location in the center of
Kentucky, Centre College has become a true
center of academic excellence in the Com-
monwealth. From its beginning, Centre has
emphasized personal education, and in keep-
ing with that tradition, currently maintains a
10–1 student to faculty ratio. A leader in study
abroad programs, Centre also promotes a
global education, with 85 percent of Centre
students studying abroad at least once.
Centre offers more than fifty majors and mi-
nors across the liberal arts spectrum, and its
alumni include two United States vice presi-
dents and two Supreme Court justices. I have
had Centre graduates on my staff and have
always been impressed by their diligence and
the quality of their work. My colleagues may
recognize Centre College as the host of not
one, but two vice presidential election de-
bates, both in 2000 and, because the 2000
debate was handled so well, again in 2012.
I commend Centre College for its commit-
ment to education, and to the success of its
students. I am proud to represent Centre Col-
lege in Congress. Congratulations to Centre
College—here’s to the next 200 years.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF BILL HORNER
HON. MARK E. GREEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 11, 2019
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to commemorate a public serv-
ant and great American, the late Mr. Bill
Horner of Pocahontas, Tennessee. President
Ronald Reagan once said, ‘‘Some people
spend an entire lifetime wondering if they
made a difference in this world. Marines don’t
have that problem.’’
Mr. Horner retired as a Major in the United
States Marine Corps after serving our country
and making a difference for twenty-two years
as a Marine pilot. He then helped spread the
Gospel message for sixteen years by flying
from churches in Alabama and Tennessee to
many places in South America. And as one of
his greatest accomplishments, he maintained
a loving marriage with his wife Mrs. Emilie
Horner for 46 years. She, his children Teresa
and Chip, grandchildren Donald and Judith,
and his eight great-grandchildren survive him.
We know that he made a difference to their
lives and to our country in the honorable 82
years that he lived.

SPECIAL ENVOY TO MONITOR AND
COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 10, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in strong support of H.R. 221, the Spe-
cial Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semi-
tism Act of 2019, important and bipartisan leg-
islation that will ensure we continue address-
ing anti-Semitism across the globe. I was
proud to cosponsor this bill last Congress, and
I am proud to cosponsor it again this year, in
the hope that the Senate will this time act to
send it to the President for signature.
The Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat
Anti-Semitism Act would elevate the position
of Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-
Semitism to the rank of Ambassador, reporting
directly to the Secretary of State; as the pri-
mary advisor and coordinator for U.S. govern-
ment efforts to monitor and combat Anti-Semi-
tism and Anti-Semitic incitement in foreign
countries. In short, it will ensure that the
United States continues to play a leading role
in combatting Anti-Semitism across the globe.
We have seen a dramatic increase in anti-
Semitism in recent years. It is ugly. It is tragic.
It must be addressed. High attacks like the
one at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket
in Paris and the horrific shooting at the Tree
of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh captured the
world’s attention and forced the issue into the
international spotlight. Other incidents, includ-
ing the stabbing of Holocaust survivor Mireille
Knoll in Paris, the shattering of windows at the
HaCarmel kosher restaurant in Amsterdam,
and countless other daily occurrences of har-
assment or physical assaults against Jews do
not garner as much attention. Europe is facing
a growing number of right-wing, nationalist,
extremist political movements, and across the
globe, the growing trend of anti-Semitism
masked as anti-Zionism threatens Jewish
communities and delegitimizes the existence
of Israel.
Those of us who have served on the U.S.
Helsinki Commission have taken efforts to
combat anti-Semitism at the international level.
As the incoming Chairman of the Commission,
I intend to continue prioritizing this work with
representatives of governments throughout
Europe to highlight the resurgence of Anti-
Semitism and elevate efforts to push back
against this despicable resurgence through
education, outreach, and improved security.
Mr. SMITH, Mr. HOYER, Senator CARDIN and I
have all chaired the Helsinki Commission, and
together, we have worked with several other
Members of both the House and Senate, as
well as with parliamentarians particularly from
Germany and Canada, to have the Parliamen-
tary Assembly of the 57-country OSCE con-
demn the escalation of anti-Semitic violence in
Europe. We first did this at the Assembly’s
2002 annual session in Berlin, Germany, and
have kept it on the agenda there ever since,
suggesting measures to counter anti-Semitic
statements and acts of violence alike. I
pushed it strongly while serving as President
of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly from
2004 to 2006, and then as chairman of the
Commission from 2007 to 2008. We suc-
ceeded in getting OSCE institutions, officials
and diplomatic representatives to incorporate
efforts to combat anti-Semitism and other
forms of intolerance into their ongoing work.
Ensuring that our country continues to lead
in the fight against Anti-Semitism is a priority
that we should all embrace. I fully support this
measure and urge my colleagues to do the
same.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND
SERVICE OF ED STOKES
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 11, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and service of Ed
Stokes for his generosity, friendliness, and
legacy in our community.
Ed was born in South Carolina in 1922 and
was raised in North Carolina. After serving in
the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, he
attended the University of California, Berkeley.
From his time as a young adolescent in high
school to his years in university, Ed worked at
local grocery stores to support his family.
In 1968, Ed founded Diablo Foods in Lafay-
ette and quickly became a beloved figure in
the city’s community. Under the motto ‘‘good
service, fairness, quality, and friendliness
know no compromise,’’ Ed ensured that Diablo
Foods was a welcoming place for local resi-
dents.
An important member of his community, Ed
was awarded Lafayette’s Citizen of the Year
and Business Person of the Year—twice. He
was also the recipient of the Su Stauffer
Acalanes Friend of Education Award, a Marine
Corps League Award, the Humanitarian Award
by the Soroptimist Club, and the Paul Harris
Fellow Award from the Lafayette Rotary. Ed’s
commitment to public service extended to his
work for the Lafayette Chamber of Commerce,
Rotary Club, and Town Hall Theatre.
Ed will be sincerely missed by those who
had the pleasure of knowing him, and will be
remembered for his endless service to and
love for his community.

HIGHLAND PARK HIGH SCHOOL
STATE CHAMPS
HON. COLIN Z. ALLRED
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 11, 2019
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to commemorate a historic achievement
by the young student athletes at Highland
Park High School.
The Highland Park High School varsity foot-
ball team won the 5A state championship for
the third year in a row, and the Highland Park
tennis teams also won state titles this very
school year.
On Saturday, January 12, 2019, at Goar
Park, the Highland Park Independent School
District and the cities of Highland Park and
University Park will host a well deserved Pa-
rade of Champions.
As their Congressman, I am excited to cele-
brate these hard fought victories with them.
Achievements such as this don’t happen
overnight and they take the support of fami-
lies, friends, teachers, coaches, faculty, staff
and volunteers. It really does take a commu-
nity. And this community should be proud.
As a former student athlete myself, I know
the hard work it takes, day in and day out, to
practice and work to win as a team. All while
prioritizing work in the classroom and studying
hard.
They have shown that North Texans are
champions, and we couldn’t be prouder of
what they all have accomplished together.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE DENTON
COUNTY MASTER GARDENER AS-
SOCIATION
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 11, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Denton County Master
Gardener Association as it celebrates 30
years of service to the people of Denton
County.
The Denton County Master Gardener Asso-
ciation completes more than 40 horticultural
projects each year, working with local organi-
zations such as the Texas Master Naturalists,
the Denton Historical Association, and local 4–
H clubs.
Volunteers from the Denton County Master
Gardener Association must work to earn the
title of Master Gardener. These dedicated vol-
unteers are required to undergo over 80 hours
of training to achieve the coveted title of
‘‘Texas Master Gardener.’’ Master Gardeners
volunteer on behalf of Texas A&M’s AgriLife
Extension, following Texas A&M University’s
research-based horticultural recommendations.
The Denton County Master Gardener Asso-
ciation utilizes their specialized training to
brighten the community and pass along their
horticultural knowledge to future generations.
Through their award winning Science with Atti-
tude program, Master Gardeners share infor-
mation through elementary school teachers in
their community and distribute over 3000
seedlings annually to elementary schools in
the Denton Independent School District.
Additionally, this organization supports com-
munity gardens throughout Denton County
and work in conjunction with the Community
Garden for the Town of Flower Mound, the
gardens of Fair Oaks Independent Living Cen-
ter, the Good Samaritan Village, and the Lake
Lewisville Environmental Learning Area.
On behalf of the constituents of Texas’s
26th District, I would like to thank the Denton
County Master Gardener Association for 30
years of dedicated service, which has made
Denton County a better place to live and work.

INTRODUCTION OF SENSIBLE
ENFORCEMENT OF CANNABIS ACT
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 11, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, more than
a year ago, the U.S. Department of Justice re-
scinded the Cole Memorandum, a directive
that provided a framework for states to pursue
the reasonable regulation of cannabis within
their borders. The Department’s ill-conceived
decision adversely affects California and other
states that in ‘‘good faith’’ implemented regu-
latory frameworks that relied on the memo.
In November 2016, the people of California
spoke up and voted in favor of Proposition 64,
which legalized recreational cannabis, joining
the growing number of states in our nation
that have legalized recreational cannabis.
To date, ten states have legalized rec-
reational cannabis and more than 30 states—
which represent more than half of the Amer-
ican population—permit some form of medical
cannabis use. The repeal of the Cole Memo
contravenes the will of the American public.
Furthermore, this decision will negatively affect
numerous Americans who utilize cannabis for
medical purposes. We need to provide con-
sumers, patients, businesses, and regulators
with certainty.
Therefore, I am introducing the bipartisan
Sensible Enforcement of Cannabis Act. This
legislation will prohibit the Attorney General
from prosecuting individuals for any conduct
that concerns medicinal or recreational can-
nabis use in states in which it is legal, with
narrow exceptions provided for the safety of
the public.

IN MEMORY OF BENJAMIN
EDWARD NORMAN, USN
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 11, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to ask the House to commemorate Navy
Petty Officer MMN3 Benjamin Edward Norman
who tragically lost his life in a weather-related
car accident on December 31, 2018.
Ben was born October 4, 1998 in Man-
chester, CT to Sam and Teresa. Having
moved to Coventry as a teenager, Ben grad-
uated from Coventry High School in 2016.
Soon thereafter, Ben, an accomplished Eagle
Scout, enlisted in the U.S. Navy. His service
was just beginning to take shape in recent
months when he was selected to serve in the
prestigious Nuclear Propulsion Training Pro-
gram, a demanding assignment that requires
high intellect and diligent work habits. Last
year I had the opportunity to meet Ben and his
father Sam, and Ben was excited to begin this
new mission that would have taken him to the
most advanced naval platforms in our nation’s
fleet.
Ben was also on course to marry his be-
loved fiancée, Asia Jurkiewicz, a native of Po-
land whom he met during a Boy Scout ex-
change program in Krakow, Poland. Madam
Speaker, Ben’s passing is a terrible loss for
Asia, Ben’s family and our nation. His public-
spirited approach to life and willingness to vol-
unteer to wear our nation’s uniform in the U.S.
Navy pointed to a life of great accomplish-
ment. Hopefully his memory will inspire others
to follow his example. I ask my colleagues to
please join me in honoring the life and mem-
ory of Ben Norman and expressing our deep-
est sympathies for his family and friends.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
PATRICIA TANQUARY
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 11, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Patricia Tanquary for her
dedicated and passionate service to our com-
munity.
Patricia has a Masters in social work from
San Diego State University and both a Mas-
ters in public health administration and a Doc-
torate in social welfare from University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley. Before working for Contra
Costa County, Patricia was employed at Kai-
ser Permanente for 18 years, holding positions
such as Director of Member Services, Hospital
and Health Plan Administrator, Continuing
Care Leader, and Director of National Provider
Contracting.
In 2007, Patricia was named the Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer of the Contra Costa Health
Plan (CCHP). Over the past 11 years, Patricia
managed an innovative and complex plan that
became one of the original Covered California
Health Plans. Her time as CEO is character-
ized by her partnerships and her commitment
to serving low-income and vulnerable popu-
lations.
Through her work, CCHP added over 7,200
contracts with local providers to meet the de-
mand of an expanding membership. She also
managed a strong relationship with County
Mental Health to administer effective mental
health care. Under her leadership, CCHP also
provided one of the first Special Needs Plans
for seniors and persons with disabilities and
worked with the Contra Costa Regional Med-
ical Center to create a Center of Excellence
for Autism diagnoses.

CONGRATULATING THE MERAMEC
REGIONAL PLANNING COMMIS-
SION ON THEIR 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, January 11, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate the Meramec Re-
gional Planning Commission on their 50th an-
niversary.
On January 23, 1969, Governor Warren E.
Hearnes signed a proclamation establishing
the Meramec Regional Planning Commission.
Dent County Presiding Judge J.E. Bergman,
Salem Mayor Jack Masters, Washington
County Presiding Judge Jesse Essmyer,
Potosi Mayor Leon Camillo, and Dent County
Clerk Don Prewitt were all in attendance to
mark the historic occasion. A 5,154-square
mile radius of beautiful gently rolling hills,
deep valleys, and numerous rivers make up
the region. Thirty-six towns serve as industrial
havens and are surrounded by countryside
where the small farmer continues to prevail.
The commission successfully serves 8
counties: Gasconade, Dent, Crawford, Maries,
Osage, Phelps, Pulaski, and Washington.
Throughout the commission’s longstanding
history, a strong reputation has been built with
a variety of programs being offered including
grant writing and administration, economic de-
velopment, community planning, emergency
planning, training and grand administration,
hazard mitigation planning, solid waste plan-
ning, grant administration and program imple-
mentation, small business loans, HUD housing
rental assistance and family self-sufficiency
programs, promotion/administration/growth of
community foundations, project development,
and legislative advocacy. From these pro-
grams, many businesses have been wel-
comed into the small towns where they have
been successful while enjoying Missouri’s pic-
turesque natural beauty and diverse cultural
heritage.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
congratulating the Meramec Regional Planning
Commission on their 50th anniversary. This
milestone is a great testament of their commit-
ment to the counties they serve.
