PRAYER
Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Cap-
itol Hill United Methodist Church,
Washington, D.C., offered the following
prayer:
Beloved God, we bow our heads as
citizens of a country with many faiths
but founded on the singular belief that
out of many can come one. E pluribus
unum.
We give thanks for each one of Your
children serving in the people’s House:
Members, administrators, and support
staff. Thank You for the unique gifts of
each one.
We also repent that here and around
the world, we turn against one another
with words and even weapons. We let
fear focus us on people ‘‘like us.’’ We
sacrifice the call to serve all upon the
altar of party unity. God, forgive us.
Fill us with the words of Tony Morri-
son, beloved American saint, reminding
us that ‘‘The function of freedom is to
free someone else’’ and the purpose of
our power is ‘‘to empower someone
else.’’
God, free us to love and live for one
another, for each person we represent,
making us one not in ideology or iden-
tity, but in empathy and compassion,
seeking the others’ good as if it is our
own. E pluribus unum.
Amen, and amen.
f

RECOGNIZING REMARKS OF RABBI
DR. ISRAEL ZOBERMAN
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to include in the RECORD a statement
from Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman, founder and
spiritual leader of Temple Lev Tikvah in Vir-
ginia Beach, and the representative of the
Jewish community at the City of Chesapeake’s
civic occasions.
CONSIDER ‘‘DAY OF CARING’’ TO HONOR BEACH
VICTIMS
(By Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman)
At this trying and beclouded time of grief
and sorrow, we gradually and painfully come
to grips with the enormity of our losses di-
minishing us all as well as our newly discov-
ered vulnerabilities. Our beloved Virginia
Beach and the entire Hampton Roads com-
munity lost its beautiful but dangerously
blinding innocence on that fateful Friday
afternoon. How could we imagine that the
mass shootings in other regions would not
reach us too? Truth to be told no one is insu-
lated and immune in the wide American
landscape. What happens around us near and
far is bound to affect us at home. However,
we are obligated to protect ourselves as best
as we can given whatever limitations we
face.
We are called upon now to pick up together
the shattered pieces of a complex and con-
founding reality to reemerge rededicated and
reenergized to make our threatened world,
inwardly and outwardly, a safer home and
better place for one and all. Our fallen 12 he-
roes who so callously and cowardly were
taken from their loving families, co-workers,
neighbors, friends and all of us, deserve no
less. For their cherished memories’ sake and
our very survival and future let us engage
more than ever with those around us, par-
ticularly the ones we deem to be beyond our
intimate circle of close associates.
We acknowledge that the social phe-
nomenon of alienation is a hallmark of our
challenging times. Pleasant surprises do
await us when willing to reach out beyond
the familiar and engage others in simple but
far-reaching acts of human interaction that
hitherto we regarded as too threatening and
non-consequential. There is much to be
learned, gained and prevented by exercising
our extraordinary ability of ordinary com-
munication in our wonderfully diverse
human environment in Hampton Roads in
which too many may feel lonely, unnoticed
and undervalued.
So called ‘‘strangers’’ cease to be strangers
once we encounter and appreciate our com-
mon humanity and shared American dream
in which we all have a critical stake. The
Bible wisely instructs us that a celebration
is not complete without including the
strangers in our midst so they may trans-
form their status, claiming their rightful
place in society and in our hearts. Spreading
more and more conscious but random acts of
kindness and goodness in our shared garden
of life and civic exchange, is bound to grow
beneficial returns in kind. At times a reas-
suring smile and a generous act on the road
and in the office can go a long way and even
stymie road and office rage.
Our democratic and educational institu-
tions on all levels demand our involvement
and support that necessary change should
occur. Surely prudent and common-sense
gun control legislation along with an ac-
countable and responsible mental health sys-
tem are on the agenda. Are we waiting for
more mass shootings’ tragedies, oceans of
tears and cries of family survivors of dif-
ferent languages and geographies, and heart-
wrenching memorial services to propel us
into action? Ought we not teach, beginning
at one’s home, that each finite human life is
of infinite worth, and each of us is an entire,
irreplaceable universe of purpose and mean-
ing reflecting the Most High? We are wit-
nesses to what irreparable damage can be
done by a few minutes of unchecked madness
and unrelenting evil, using weapons of mass
destruction equipped with silencers. Let us
not allow a corrosive culture of death to re-
place a promising culture of life.
It would be advantageous for our entire na-
tion to take a day out for national soul-
searching and resolve to delve into issues
that should be paramount on our American
agenda. A day in which we engage in discus-
sions and activities toward healing our na-
tion, creating a ‘‘National Day of Caring’’
that would create a ripple effect. The slogan
‘‘VB Strong’’ has joined us to the sorrowful
and hurting family of previously affected
communities, even as we pray and plan that
our Virginia Beach is the last in such an
unenviable category of suffering. I suggest
that we be better served by the slogan, ‘‘VB
Cares,’’ which is ultimately the source of au-
thentic strength. What befell us will surely
not define us, but we cannot deny it. It may
yet refine us to become more compassionate,
considerate and connected with each other.
My 99-year-old mom, a Polish Holocaust sur-
vivor, called me from Israel that dark day,
asking, ‘‘What’s happening to America?’’
Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman is the founder
and spiritual leader of Temple Lev Tikvah in
Virginia Beach. He is Honorary Senior Rabbi
Scholar at Eastern Shore Chapel Episcopal
Church in Virginia Beach. He represents the
Jewish community at the city of Chesa-
peake’s civic occasions.

SALT LAKE COUNTY HEALTH
DEPARTMENT AWARD
HON. BEN McADAMS
OF UTAH
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, public
health departments have long provided a line
of first defense, protecting the well-being of
local communities. From monitoring air and
water, to inspecting food safety in restaurants,
to offering life-saving vaccines, public health
department employees serve tirelessly. Utah’s
largest public health department is now getting
well-deserved national recognition for its serv-
ice.
The Salt Lake County Health Department
has been honored as ‘‘Health Department of
the Year’’ by the voice of the nation’s nearly
3,000 local government health departments—
the National Association of County and City
Health Officials (NACCHO). Judges scored
award applicants on their innovation and cre-
ativity, implementation, impact in the commu-
nity and engagement of community and di-
verse partners.
The Salt Lake County Health Department
stood out on several fronts, including its re-
sponse to the county’s hepatitis A outbreak
from 2017 to 2019; innovative use of real-time
public health data; and a new public health
center in downtown Salt Lake City that fea-
tures co-located clinical services provided by
Community Health Centers, Inc.
The award comes the same year that the
health department celebrates the 50th anniver-
sary of its current form as a combined city-
county health department, its 120th anniver-
sary as a county agency and its 170th anni-
versary of providing public health services to
the Salt Lake Valley.
Utahns can go about their daily lives, secure
in the knowledge that behind the scenes, pub-
lic health department professionals are on the
job. Whether it is designing innovative pro-
grams to improve air quality or providing flu
vaccines to prevent illness, the Salt Lake
County Health Department is an important
partner in keeping Utahns safe, healthy and
able to enjoy an excellent quality of life.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE EXEM-
PLARY SERVICE OF KIMBERLY
ISMAIL
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Kimberly Ismail, winner of
the Volunteer of the Year Governor’s Service
Award. Her service to the Dearborn commu-
nity is worthy of commendation.
Kimberly Ismail is employed by Dearborn
Public Schools and has inspired her fellow
staff everyday with her kindness and drive to
help others in every way that she can. Ms.
Ismail chairs the Dearborn City Beautiful Com-
mission, which promotes beautification efforts
and improvement of the appearance of the
City of Dearborn. She also serves on the
Board of Directors for the Dearborn Symphony
and as Vice President of the League of
Women Voters of Dearborn and Dearborn
Heights.
Ms. Ismail is known among her colleagues
for her selfless dedication in her service to
others. For years, she has organized the For-
gotten Harvest hunger walk and was the first
to introduce the ‘‘Arrive Alive’’ anti-distracted
driving campaign in Michigan. During the
school year, Ms. Ismail helps provide the
school supplies that local children need to
succeed. She has also taken the lead in help-
ing new refugees gain access to food and

other community resources and during the
holidays she can be found organizing food
and gift drives for the less fortunate. The des-
ignation of Michigan Volunteer of the Year is
well deserved. Her passion for volunteerism,
patience, kindness, and devotion to the com-
munity is inspiring to all.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Kimberly Ismail and her life-
long commitment to the Dearborn community.
Ms. Ismail has positively impacted countless
lives in the City of Dearborn as well as across
the state of Michigan.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE PASSING
OF ROCCO LONGO
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the life of Rocco Longo, who
served the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
for more than four decades as a public serv-
ant.
A resident of Duxbury, Rocco Longo spent
his entire life in Massachusetts. Rocco served
as Billerica’s town manager for three years be-
fore accepting the town manager position in
Marshfield. His retirement as Marshfield’s town
manager wrapped up a four-decade career
serving in municipal government. In 2018,
Rocco was awarded the Joseph Moakley Pub-
lic Service Award from Bridgewater State Uni-
versity.
Following his retirement, Rocco never truly
stopped working. He served in multiple interim
positions as well as serving as an instructor in
a local government leadership certification pro-
gram at Suffolk University. In these roles, he
is remembered as a great friend who had a
talent for bringing people together. He was a
calming force in times of trouble, and never
failed to lift the spirits of those he worked with.
Rocco Longo led a life dedicated to local
government, his community, and his family.
He not only excelled in his work, but he was
a loving husband to his wife Colleen and fa-
ther to his children Parker and Tyler. He will
be dearly missed in my home state.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the
life of Rocco Longo. I ask that my colleagues
join me in recognizing his commitment to his
family, his local community, and the Common-
wealth of Massachusetts.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHARLES
SMITH ON HIS RETIREMENT AS
PRESIDENT OF THE MISSOURI
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIA-
TION
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of the achievements of
Mr. Charles Smith, a man who has dedicated
his life to the betterment of the public edu-
cation system in the great state of Missouri.
Mr. Smith is retiring after six years as Presi-
dent of the Missouri National Education Asso-
ciation (MNEA), six years as Vice-President of
the same organization, and decades as a pub-
lic-school teacher. He leaves behind a legacy
of magnanimous leadership and a passion for
public service, which will continue to impact
the lives of young people throughout Missouri.
As Mr. Smith retires from his position as
President of the Missouri National Education
Association, he will be greatly missed by his
peers and colleagues. In this role, he oversaw
35,000 members, while serving as the official
spokesperson for the organization, as well as
acting as a liaison between local and national
leaders. Upon graduation from Northwest Mis-
souri State University, his extensive career
began in Kansas City’s Center School District.
He spent twenty-seven years there, teaching
communication arts and advising the jour-
nalism program, eventually becoming the chair
of the department. Mr. Smith directly impacted
the lives of thousands of students throughout
his tenure in the Center School District, instill-
ing in young people ambition to pursue their
dreams. George Washington Carver once
said, ‘‘Education is the key to unlock the gold-
en door of freedom.’’ Mr. Smith’s work in edu-
cation has truly brought that precious freedom
to the youth of Missouri through a lifetime of
dedicated service and steadfast commitment.
Mr. Charles Smith has a passion for social
justice and bettering the lives of others, which
is evident by the time he has spent as an ac-
tivist for the African-American community. He
served as the first Vice President of the Mis-
souri NAACP for fourteen years, later becom-
ing the organization’s President for the next
six. He spent time as the National Chairman
of the NEA Black Caucus where he advocated
for over 400,000 African-American teachers,
education support professionals, college stu-
dents, retired members, and administrators.
He has worked to create an inclusive commu-
nity in which all people are afforded equal
rights and opportunities. Mr. Smith’s commit-
ment to advocating for the African-American
community in Missouri not only speaks vol-
umes to his meritorious character, but also re-
flects the legacy he leaves behind, as an edu-
cator, activist, and proponent of necessary
change.
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Mr. Charles Smith on his retire-
ment, as he has gone above and beyond the
duty of a citizen to give back to his community
time and time again. He leaves behind a leg-
acy of great leadership, as his accomplish-
ments continue to grow and touch every cor-
ner of our community. He will be greatly
missed by his peers, colleagues, and the com-
munity that has benefited from Mr. Smith’s
leadership. I am proud to recognize this ex-
ceptional civil servant for the work he has
done and the lives he has touched within Mis-
souri’s Fifth Congressional District.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOSH
SYRJAMAKI
HON. DEAN PHILLIPS
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the decades-long service of Mr. Josh
Syrjamaki and to congratulate him upon his
retirement from Congressional service. A na-
tive of the Iron Range of Minnesota, Josh
dedicated himself to bettering his neighbors’
lives, both in his home state and across the
country. His tenure in government began over
25 years ago, as a Committee Clerk in the
Minnesota State Senate, and continued
through prominent roles in the United States
Senate and House of Representatives.
A public servant of the highest order, Josh
was a listener whose finger always rested
firmly on the pulse of his office’s constituents.
As a senior aide to the late Senator Paul
Wellstone, Mr. Syrjamaki visited every corner
of Minnesota, hearing the stories, dreams, and
concerns of everyday citizens. His collabo-
rative approach to government continued in
his work as Representative Tim Walz’s Chief
of Staff, where he met with farmers,
businesspeople, and local leaders across Min-
nesota’s first district, determined to affect
meaningful change and to build a stronger
community. This, Madam Speaker, is what
representational government is all about.
Mr. Syrjamaki selflessly advocated on behalf
of the American people, forcefully supporting
needed improvements for our nation’s brave
veterans. As a National Coordinator for the
United Steelworkers Union, Josh organized
grassroots campaigns to ensure that laborers
received fair wages and job security. In his
last months as a Congressional staffer, Josh
joined me in structuring my office and devel-
oping key strategies to best serve the people
of Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District.
Above all, Mr. Syrjamaki always believed,
‘‘We all do better, when we all do better.’’ That
collectively, people can unite to cultivate a
brighter tomorrow. His ability to strategically
motivate and inspire fellow citizens produced
decades of leadership that improved schools,
bettered working conditions, improved the
lives of our nation’s veterans, and expanded
access to health care.
While his tenure in the federal government
ended this past March, Josh’s unwavering
commitment to his fellow citizens continues
today in Minnesota. As the Chief of Staff in
the State’s Bureau of Prisons, Mr. Syrjamaki
wields his belief in every person’s potential to
establish a reformed correctional system that
focuses on education, sharply reducing the
likelihood that an inmate will reoffend, and
producing a more vibrant society.
I am joined by my colleagues here in the
U.S. House of Representatives, countless
former staff members, and citizens across the
great State of Minnesota in expressing my sin-
cere appreciation for Josh’s tireless service to
this country. I look forward to witnessing his
continued success and wish him well on his
Congressional retirement.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1043
August 9, 2019
The first European settlers to the region ar-
rived in the early 1830s, enticed by rich farm-
land and the promise of a better life. Originally
known as Babcock’s Grove, the Village of
Lombard was officially incorporated in 1869
and named in honor of Josia Lewis Lombard,
a Chicago banker and real estate developer.
Among the early pioneers to the region
were Sheldon and Harriet Peck. Sheldon was
a folk artist of some renown, but he and Har-
riet also are remembered for their vigorous ac-
tivism in support of women’s rights, public
education, temperance, and most importantly,
the anti-slavery movement. The Pecks made
their home a stop on the Underground Rail-
road and assisted numerous runaway slaves
on their journey to freedom. To commemorate
their courage, the Peck homestead was in-
ducted in August of 2011 into the National
Park-sponsored ‘Network to Freedom’ pro-
gram.
The women’s suffrage movement also en-
joyed one of its earliest triumphs thanks to the
inspired advocacy of a Lombard attorney.
Ellen Martin successfully argued that the Lom-
bard town charter gave women the right to
vote, as it conferred voter status on any resi-
dent of Lombard who had reached the age of
majority. On April 6, 1891, Ellen Martin cast
the first vote by a woman in our state, nearly
30 years before the enactment of the 20th
Amendment to the United States Constitution.
I believe the original settlers of Lombard
would be deeply proud of the village they es-
tablished and its distinguished history. Madam
Speaker, I want to recognize this profoundly
American story of courage, determination, and
good works, and to acknowledge the vibrant
history and future of the Village of Lombard.

HONORING KATHERINE RAPP, NA-
TIONAL JUNIOR MISS AGRI-
CULTURE USA
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and excitement that I rise today
to honor Katherine Rapp of Paxinos, Pennsyl-
vania. Katherine is this year’s National Junior
Miss Agriculture USA.
Katherine is an exceptional young woman
who is incredibly engaged in her community.
This Fall, she will attend Danville Area High
School and participate in Future Farmers of
America and the National Honor Society. At
her young age, she has already won Grand
and Reserve market hogs at the Bloomsburg
Fair and was Grand Champion Market Steer
at the Montour-Delong Fair. Given her passion
for agriculture, she chose to participate in this
year’s Miss Agriculture USA competition. I can
think of nobody better to promote American
agriculture, and our strong Pennsylvania farms
and dairies than Katherine.
I ask my colleagues to join me in com-
mending Katherine on her commitment to agri-
culture. On behalf of the citizens of Pennsylva-
nia’s Ninth Congressional District, and the
U.S. House of Representatives, I congratulate
Katherine on her crown and wish her the best
in this and all her future endeavors.
IN RECOGNITION OF THE VOLUN-
TEERS OF THE SHELTER ASSO-
CIATION OF WASHTENAW COUN-
TY FOR THEIR EXEMPLARY
SERVICE
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Shelter Association of
Washtenaw County for receiving Governor
Gretchen Whitmer’s Outstanding Volunteer Or-
ganization Award. The association’s tremen-
dous dedication to ending homelessness has
made a meaningful impact in the Washtenaw
County community and makes them a deserv-
ing recipient of this honor.
Since 1982, the Shelter Association of
Washtenaw County has supported individuals
struggling with homelessness in the commu-
nity. The association provides a variety of
services to a diverse group of people experi-
encing homelessness that are designed to re-
turn their sense of hope and dignity. Thanks to
the compassionate service of the association,
people are given a renewed sense of stability
through consistent access to food, shelter,
medical care, and other programs that help
them learn how to succeed independently.
The volunteers of the Shelter Association of
Washtenaw County have made a meaningful
difference in Washtenaw County. Through
their efforts, they have become the primary
provider of services and emergency shelter in
the community, and their ceaseless efforts
continue to make a positive impact in the lives
they touch—evident in their new Art Break
Studio that has fostered a safe, creative, and
welcoming space that has allowed many to re-
duce their anxiety and build a greater sense of
self-esteem.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating the Shelter Association of
Washtenaw County for their exceptional ef-
forts. Their lasting impact on the Washtenaw
County community is worthy of commendation.

RECOGNIZING LUCIO ‘‘CHIO’’
GONZALES AND BUTTER TORRES
GONZALES
HON. TJ COX
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the leadership of Lucio
‘‘Chio’’ Gonzales and Butter Torres Gonzales.
Together, this couple has dedicated over 60
years of community and public service to the
city of Delano, California and the Central Val-
ley.
A native of Blythe, California, Mr. Gonzales
settled in the Central Valley in the 1950s after
spending his early years working as a migrant
farmworker in the region’s rich agricultural
fields. Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales met in the his-
toric farmworker community of Delano and
were married on November 24, 1956. The
couple took over ownership and operation of
the People’s Market in 1969, and the two
worked together side by side managing the
grocery store in Delano for 40 years.
Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales formed a strong
bond over the years with the Filipino Commu-
nity of Delano. The two have served as advo-
cates and allies for the inclusion and rep-
resentation of Filipinos in Delano civic life.
They played an instrumental role in electing
Leonard T. Velasco to the Delano City Council
in 1972, the first Filipino American to serve on
the elected body.
Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales have also worked to
ensure the success of Delano’s Philippine
Weekend community celebration for the last
45 years. They have helped build the event
from a small community gathering all those
years ago, to a large month-long festival that
draws thousands of visitors from across the
country. It is fitting that Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales
are being honored by the community with the
2019 Mabuhay Award.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in recognizing Lucio ‘‘Chio’’ Gonzales
and Butter Torres Gonzales for their dedica-
tion and service to the Filipino Community of
Delano, the city of Delano, and the Central
Valley.

HONORING CLARENCE ‘‘BUD’’
RANDALL’S 100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life and service of Clarence ‘‘Bud’’
Randall as he celebrates his 100th birthday.
Throughout his life, Mr. Randall has dem-
onstrated exemplary patriotism through his
service in World War II, and longstanding de-
votion to his family and friends.
Serving as a Staff Sergeant in the Army’s
373rd Engineers Unit during War II, Mr. Ran-
dall supported efforts in Germany, France,
Belgium, and England. During the war, Mr.
Randall worked with his unit of engineers to
ensure the safety of his fellow soldiers by
clearing mines and constructing floating docks
used in Normandy. Notably, at the war’s end,
Mr. Randall and his unit were among the first
service members to enter Nazi concentration
camps and liberate those held captive.
After completion of his military service, Mr.
Randall returned home to earn a bachelor’s
degree in accounting from Robert Morris Uni-
versity. In 1969, Mr. Randall moved with his
wife and six children to Canton, New York,
where he then accepted a job as the Vice
President of Business Affairs for St. Lawrence
University. Mr. Randall held this position for 16
years before retiring from the University.
Today, Mr. Randall remains active, continuing
to prepare taxes for clients as an enrolled
agent.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
in the House join me in honoring the life and
service of Mr. Clarence ‘‘Bud’’ Randall. Mr.
Randall’s life has been one marked by admi-

BOHME FOUNDERS—SMALL BUSI-
NESS PERSONS OF THE YEAR IN
UTAH 2019
HON. BEN McADAMS
OF UTAH
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, two sis-
ters who immigrated from Argentina to Utah
as children turned hard work and a dream into
a remarkable business success story in just
12 years.
In 2007, Vivien and Fernanda Bohme first
opened in a temporary space in Fashion Place
Mall, to sell their clothing during the approach-
ing holiday season. Their fashion hit turned
out to be what they dubbed ‘‘sexy, modest’’
denims and tees. After a strong start, they
opened a permanent store in Orem’s Univer-
sity Mall, just ahead of what became the Great
Recession. Like many small businesses, they
struggled, but they persevered.
Next, they started a location in Salt Lake
City’s Gateway Mall, which they remodeled
themselves to save money. Vivien stopped
work one night to go to the hospital and de-
liver her baby, but soon returned to finish the
space. Profits were used to pay off debt and
expand into new areas. ‘‘Bootstrap was our
middle name,’’ Vivien told a local news re-
porter.
Their entrepreneurial success earned them
a mention in Inc. magazine’s list of 5,000 fast-
est-growing companies. They now operate 16
stores in five states and are known for making
themselves available to their 225 employees
at all levels.
Every Bohme employee is given three paid
days off to volunteer at a charity of their
choice. In 2018, the company experienced
record profits and revenue growth.
Last May, during National Small Business
Week the U.S. Small Business Administration
honored Vivien and Fernanda jointly as ‘‘Utah
Small Business Person of the Year.’’ Their in-
spiring story is one example of how Utah’s
economy and our communities thrive thanks to
the drive, determination and dedication shown
by diverse individuals willing to chase their
dreams here in America.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH
BIRTHDAY OF HAZEL JACOBS
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of Hazel Jacobs, a resident of
Pocasset, Massachusetts, who turned 100
years young on July 27, 2019.
Hazel was born in Sulphur, Louisiana. In her
early twenties she was inspired to join the war
effort during World War II, becoming a mem-
ber of the Woman’s Army Corps. Hazel contin-
ued her service in the Pentagon, coding and
deciphering transcontinental messages in the
Classified Message Center. It was during her
time at the Pentagon that Hazel attended a
dinner party with a friend—a dinner party that
turned out to be a setup. Hazel’s friend intro-
duced her to a soldier named Sal David
‘‘Jake’’ Jacobs. The two hit it off that evening,
but they both were soon discharged and went
their separate ways.
After some years apart, Hazel went to visit
a friend in Boston, and none other than Sal
Jacobs was waiting for her on the platform.
Together again, Hazel and Sal married, lived
in Boston, and had two sons, Allen and Rob-
ert. When Sal sadly passed away in 1966,
Hazel returned to her life in public service.
She worked for the City of Boston for several
years, continuing her devotion to her family
and community.
Today, Hazel lives in Pocasset, where she
enjoys her lifelong artistic hobby of needle-
point and spending cherished time with Allen,
Robert, and their families.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Hazel
Jacobs on this joyous occasion of her 100th
birthday. I ask that my colleagues join me in
wishing her many more years of health and
happiness.

MARK DALLAS—AMERICAN POLICE
HALL OF FAME OFFICER OF THE
YEAR
HON. ADAM KINZINGER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor an American hero and good
friend, Officer Mark Dallas, for being named
the National Officer of the Year by the Amer-
ican Police Hall of Fame and Museum.
On the morning of Wednesday, May 16,
2018, a student open fired inside Dixon High
School. Without hesitation, Officer Dallas
chased down the gunman and returned fire.
He disarmed the shooter and took him into
custody. Officer Dallas’ selflessness and pro-
fessionalism saved the lives of hundreds of
students and staff, including his own son.
On August 11, 2019, Officer Dallas will re-
ceive this award given to those who protect
the thin blue line. Congratulations to Officer
Mark Dallas on receiving this momentous
award and being enshrined with the other men
and women who have devoted their lives to
protect the people of the United States. It is
my great honor to once again recognize his
actions in the House of Representatives.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE DEDI-
CATED SERVICE OF BASF TO
THE MICHIGAN COMMUNITY
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize BASF for receiving Gov-
ernor Gretchen Whitmer’s Corporate and
Small Business Community Leader Award.
BASF’s commitment to the community and the
state of Michigan makes them an excellent re-
cipient of this great honor.
Since its establishment, BASF has striven to
create a sustainable future. Their innovative
work in chemistry not only rises to meet to-
day’s most pressing challenges, but also si-
multaneously promotes environmental protec-
tion and social responsibility. In 1969, BASF
became a part of the Michigan community,
opening a site in Wyandotte, Michigan. The
corporation has been a dedicated and chari-
table member of the community ever since.
BASF continues to pursue a brighter future
by investing in the future leaders of Michigan:
our children. BASF employees volunteer at the
BASF Kid’s Lab, a program that aims to in-
spire children’s interest in chemistry by bring-
ing hands-on service and demonstrations to
classrooms and science centers throughout
southeast Michigan. The program is an inter-
active, fun, and free education program de-
signed to expose young children to the mar-
vels of chemistry through simple and safe ex-
periments. Each demonstration exhibits how
chemistry can benefit the environment and
lead to a brighter future for all. These gen-
erous efforts clearly reflect BASF’s commit-
ment to investing in the next generation and
exemplify their tremendous service to Michi-
gan.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating BASF for their excep-
tional work. Their lasting impact on the Michi-
gan community is worthy of commendation.

TRIBUTE TO DR. HUGHES MELTON
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I pay trib-
ute to Dr. Hughes Melton of Bristol, Virginia, a
military veteran, public servant, and compas-
sionate physician who most recently was
Commissioner of the Virginia Department of
Behavioral Health and Developmental Serv-
ices. Dr. Melton passed away on August 2,
2019, at the age of 52 following a car wreck.
Dr. Melton was born in Florida but made
Virginia his home. After studying at Wash-
ington and Lee University and the University
of Virginia School of Medicine, he served in
the United States Army. Following his time in
the service, he opened a practice in Lebanon,
Russell County. There, he focused intently on
the needs of his rural community and devel-
oped a specialty for treating addiction. His
medical skill and care for his patients earned
him recognition by the American Academy of
Family Physicians as the Family Physician of
the Year in 2011.
He eventually took on work as an adminis-
trator, first as Chief Medical Officer for Moun-
tain States Health Alliance’s Virginia facilities
and then as Vice President of Medical Edu-
cation for its northeast and northwest markets.
Among his objectives as an administrator, he
recognized the need for more physicians to
serve Southwest Virginia. To that end, he
helped to start a family medicine residency.
During his time at Johnston Memorial Hospital
in Abingdon, he won the Servant’s Heart
Award and furthered his education with a Mas-
ter’s in Business Administration from the Uni-
versity of Virginia’s Darden School of Busi-
ness.
After serving as Deputy Commissioner of
the Virginia Health Department, he was ap-
pointed Commissioner of the Department of
Behavioral Health and Developmental Serv-
ices in 2018. As Commissioner, Dr. Melton
was able to apply his considerable talent and
deep empathy to addressing the mental and

behavioral health challenges facing Virginians.
He traveled the state and worked with public
officials, medical professionals, and all in-
vested in our Commonwealth to find answers.
Before the tragic car accident, he had been in
Harrisonburg attending a conference of advo-
cates for Virginians with intellectual and devel-
opmental disabilities, where he gave a speech
and talked with the attendees.
In addition, Madam Speaker, I knew him
and talked to him over the years about health
challenges in our home of Southwest Virginia,
including the opioid crisis. As was typical, I
last saw him volunteering his time alongside
his wife Dr. Sarah Melton at the Remote Area
Medical clinic in Wise on June 29. It is a loss
for all the Commonwealth of Virginia and par-
ticularly Southwest Virginia.
He is survived by Sarah, daughters Maggie
and Claire, and his father Howard. My prayers
are with them. As they grieve the loss of their
family member, Virginia grieves the loss of an
outstanding public servant.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF KENNETH
HOFMANN
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and service of Bay
Area businessman and devoted philanthropist
Kenneth Hofmann.
Ken was born February 15, 1923 in Oak-
land, California. He graduated from Fremont
High School in Oakland and later attended
Saint Mary’s College in Moraga before em-
barking on a successful career in home-build-
ing in 1948 as a plastering contractor.
In 1957, Ken founded his real estate devel-
opment company, Hofmann Company. By the
mid-1980s, Hofmann Company had built more
than 30,000 homes and apartments and more
than $150 million worth of commercial and in-
dustrial properties. In recognition of this re-
markable achievement, Ken was inducted into
the California Building Industry Association’s
hall of fame class of 1986.
Throughout his life, Ken used his success in
real estate to enrich and give back to his com-
munity. A true philanthropist, Ken was a sup-
porter of youth sports and education. For
nearly 30 years, Ken donated millions to De
La Salle High School, helping finance new fa-
cilities, and he opened the De La Salle Acad-
emy to provide food, books, and tutors to un-
derprivileged students. Additionally, Ken was
an ardent supporter and benefactor of the
Saint Mary’s Athletics Program. He was
named SMC Alumnus of the Year in 1983 and
severed as both a Regent and a Trustee over
the course of two decades.
Ken was an avid outdoorsman and provided
the leadership and assistance necessary to
jump-start the creation of the Pacific Flyaway
Center, a project that is currently seeking final
permits. Passionate about wildlife and water-
fowl, Ken dreamed of creating the Center to
showcase the story of the primary north-south
route for migratory birds in the Western U.S.
Ken is survived by Jean, his wife for 60
years, and their two daughters Lori and Lisa.
Ken’s contributions to the Bay Area will be
cherished, and his devotion to sports, youth,
and wildlife will long be remembered.
RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-

HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and excitement that I rise today
to honor the Northumberland County Fair on
its 20th Anniversary.
For two decades the Northumberland Coun-
ty Fair has brought communities together to
share in the county’s traditions and achieve-
ments. What began as an exhibition for local
4–H programs has quickly become a commu-
nity staple. The fair showcases the county’s
extensive achievements in agriculture, crafts,
baking, gardening, and so much more. As
they say, ‘‘If you don’t learn something at the
fair, you just aren’t paying attention.’’
Representative FRED KELLER and I ask our
colleagues to join us in congratulating the
Northumberland County Fair on twenty incred-
ible years celebrating our communities. May
this tradition continue for many years to come.

Robert, a lifelong resident of Guntown, Mis-

He served Lee County as both the Justice
Court Judge and the Sheriff for two terms.
Robert was also a former Mayor of Guntown.
He and his wife, Jo Ann, attended Guntown
First Baptist Church.
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Jo
Ann Robison Herring of Guntown; his sons—
Barry Herring of Hattiesburg and Darren Her-
ring of Guntown; his six grandchildren; two
great-grandchildren as well as many more
family members and friends.
Robert’s life was one of service, grace, love
for his family, and community. He will be

TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE
MARGIE N. GARRETT
HON. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGÁN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the extraordinary life of
the Honorable Margie N. Garrett, Trustee of
the Compton Unified School District Board of
Education.
Beginning as a Noon Duty Aide before
going on to be a Head Start Teacher, State
Preschool Teacher and Kindergarten Teacher
at Carver Elementary School in Compton,
Garrett’s career as an educator spanned four
decades prior to her retirement in 2009.
During her decades-long career as an edu-
cator, Garrett served as President and Vice
President of the Board of Directors, Bargaining
Committee Chairperson and as Political Action
Chairperson for the Compton Education Asso-
ciation—she was honored for her work with
the California Teachers Association South-
eastern Service Center.
Margie N. Garrett was first elected to the
Compton Unified School District Governing
Board of Trustees in 2009 and was re-elected
in 2013. As a trustee, Garrett served as Presi-
dent and Vice President to the Board and led
Compton Unified School District’s legislative
advocacy in Washington, D.C. and Sac-
ramento, California.
Garrett’s fight for and commitment to edu-
cational excellence and a cleaner and safer
learning environment for students was unwav-
ering. Her passion and dedication improved
working conditions and installed career path-
ways for district employees. Her advocacy and
leadership helped decrease Compton Unified
School District’s dropout rate and improved
access to early childhood education.
I, along with the residents of California’s
44th Congressional District, mourn the passing
of the Honorable Margie N. Garrett and cele-
brate her service and the indelible impact she
has had on the students of the Compton Uni-
fied School District.

CELEBRATING NATIONAL HEALTH
CENTER WEEK
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
join East Hill Family Medical in Auburn, New
York in recognizing National Health Center
Week from August 4, 2019 through August 18,
2019. This week honors the significant impact
of Community Health Centers, like East Hill
Family Medical, on America’s healthcare sys-
tem. For over 50 years, Community Health
Centers have provided high-quality, affordable,
and comprehensive primary and preventative
healthcare services in our nation’s under-
served communities.
As the country’s largest primary care net-
work, Community Health Centers currently
serve 28 million Americans across the country.
These centers are a critical element of our
healthcare system, providing healthcare to
both rural and urban populations. Often, Com-
munity Health Centers serve as the only ac-
cessible and dependable source of primary
care for underserved communities.
Every day, Community Health Centers work
to develop new approaches to healthcare, in-
tegrating a wide-range of services beyond just
primary care. Further, they are on the
frontlines of emerging healthcare crises, pro-
viding access to care for our nation’s veterans,
addressing the opioid epidemic, and respond-
ing to public health threats in the wake of nat-
ural disasters.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
in the House join me during National Health
Center Week in recognizing the great contribu-
tions of East Hill Family Medical in Auburn,
New York as well as Community Health Cen-
ters across the country.

RECOGNIZING SHIRLEY COMBS
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Ms. Shirley Combs
for the lifechanging impact she has made on
the homeless community in Toccoa, Georgia.
Nineteen years ago, Ms. Combs opened
Shirley’s Sole Food Café in Toccoa. It was
opening day, and she had just prepared heaps
of homemade creamed corn, fried chicken,
sweet potato cobbler—every southern food
you could ever imagine. Lunchtime rolled
around, and she opened her doors with excite-
ment, but there was just one small problem—
there wasn’t a customer in sight. In an effort
to ensure her delicious food didn’t go to
waste, Ms. Shirley walked out outside, found
a homeless man, and told him to round up ev-
eryone he knew to come eat.
Nearly two decades later, and Ms. Shirley is
still nurturing the homeless in more ways than
one. Each afternoon when her restaurant
closes to the general public, a line begins to
form at the back door; a line of people looking
for a second chance and a full belly. As one
of her customers recently said, ‘‘discarded
food nourishes the soul of another.’’
But Ms. Shirley’s mission to nourish souls in
need doesn’t stop there. Listed on her menu
is the option to donate to Shirley’s Shelter—a
501c3 that has helped over 300 people get off
the streets in the last 12 years, which is fund-
ed thanks to customer donations and a month-
ly breakfast. Through Shirley’s Shelter, Ms.
Shirley maintains three homes for previously
homeless men and women who help at the
restaurant until they get back on their feet
while remaining drug free. Ms. Shirley also
works to reconnect them to their families,
often distanced due to addiction.
Reflecting on her restaurant and shelter,
Ms. Shirley recently remarked, ‘‘all glory and
honor goes to God. We are called to care for
the least among us.’’
Ms. Shirley is certainly caring for the least
among us, and in the most beautiful way—by
turning her passion of cooking into care and
compassion for those less fortunate. On behalf
of the Ninth District, I want to thank her for
transforming lives in Toccoa and beyond.

HONORING THE WORLD WAR II,
KOREAN WAR, AND VIETNAM
WAR VETERANS OF ILLINOIS
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the World War II, Korean War, and Viet-
nam War veterans who traveled to Wash-
ington, D.C. on August 7, 2019 with Honor
Flight Chicago, a program that provides World
War II, Korean War, and Vietnam War vet-
erans the opportunity to visit their memorials
on The National Mall in Washington, D.C.
These memorials were built to honor their
courage and service to their country.
The American Veteran is one of our great-
est treasures. The Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors,
Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled
here on August 7th answered our nation’s call
to service during several of its greatest times
of need. Across the world, these brave Ameri-
cans risked life and limb, gave service and
sacrificed much, all while embodying what it is
to be a hero. We owe them more gratitude
than can ever be expressed.
I welcome these brave veterans to Wash-
ington and to their memorials. I am proud to
include in the RECORD the names of these
men and women for all to see, hear, and rec-
ognize, and I call on my colleagues to rise and
join me in expressing gratitude.

OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019

today to recognize the volunteers of Friends in
Deed of Ypsilanti. They have received the
Outstanding Volunteer Program Governor’s
Service Award for their commitment to the
service of those in the Washtenaw County
community.
Since 1983, Friends in Deed of Ypsilanti
has provided assistance to their neighbors in
need in Washtenaw County. These services
include direct monetary assistance, adaptive
services, the providing of needed furniture,
such as beds, and their own Circles program
which helps families get out of poverty. These
programs ‘‘fill the cracks of assistance’’ be-
tween other nonprofits and agencies. The
Friends in Deed mission is ‘‘Helping People in
Need; Building Community to End Poverty.’’
Over 200 volunteers serve nearly 7,000
hours per year at Friends in Deed of Ypsilanti.
They assist their neighbors and their families
in navigating crisis, help families with payment
related to emergency medical needs, repair
needed means of transportation, and other
one-time payments. Those who are assisted
by Friends in Deed are given the confidence,
independence, skills, support and resources,
to help them escape poverty. Friends in Deed
of Ypsilanti’s designation of Outstanding Vol-
unteer Program of the Year is well deserved.
Their services have vastly impacted and im-
proved the lives of countless families in
Washtenaw County.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the volunteers of Friends in

ing and serving their community is unmatched.

HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA

Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and scholarship of
long time Saint Mary’s College professor, Dr.
Hisham H. Ahmed.
Hisham was born in 1963 at the Dheisheh
refugee camp near Bethlehem, Palestine. De-
spite being born without eyesight, Hisham
committed himself to his studies as a child
and scored third in the Palestinian National
Exams, enabling him to study in the United
States.
Hisham began his academic career at Illi-
nois State University earning a bachelor’s de-
gree in political science in 1985. He went on
to earn a masters and doctorate in political
science from the University of California,
Santa Barbara in 1986 and 1988, respectively.
Over the next 30 years, he would teach at
Florida International University, the University
of North Dakota, Bir Zeit University in Pal-
estine, and ultimately here in Contra Costa
County at Saint Mary’s College of California.
Hisham was a renowned scholar of Middle
East politics and international relations, as well
as an expert on terrorism and the Hamas
movement. In 1993, he served as a Fulbright
Scholar in Palestine. Hisham worked con-
stantly to improve international understanding
through teaching and research, and co-found-
ed several international bodies to enhance
peace, democracy, and human rights in the
Middle East.
Beyond his professional achievements,
Hisham wrote poetry and was well-versed in
Arabic literature. He was a loving husband
and father, and had a wonderful sense of
humor. As a teacher, scholar, and advocate,
he spoke truth to power to remove walls, build
trust, and empower others.

TRIBUTE TO REVEREND DR. W.
JEROME FISHER
HON. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGÁN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the extraordinary life of
the late Reverend Dr. W. Jerome Fisher, pas-
tor of the first black church in Compton, Cali-
fornia.
Reverend Dr. W. Jerome Fisher was born
March 11, 1924 in the small town of
Merryville, Louisiana in an era of
sharecropping and Jim Crow. After accom-
panying his father to Chicago, Illinois as a
child, Jerome Fisher honorably served his
country as a medic in Normandy during World
War II.
After serving in World War II, W. Jerome
Fisher moved to Compton, California where he
built the City’s first black church, Little Zion
Missionary Baptist Church.
Under the leadership of W. Jerome Fisher,
Little Zion’s congregation grew from 13 mem-
bers to over 2,000, forming several community
outreach programs to meet the needs of the
greater community.
As pastor, Jerome Fisher, led Little Zion and
the Compton community through times of pain
and triumph for more than 50 years—including
offering the opening invocation for the 100th
Congress in 1988.
Sixty-five years after its founding, Little Zion
Missionary Baptist Church now stands as
Greater Zion Missionary Baptist Church—a
beacon of Jerome Fisher’s indelible legacy of
distinguished service. That legacy lives on
through its current pastor, Dr. Michael J. Fish-
er, his son, who took on the mantle of pastor
in 2005.
I, along with the residents of California’s
44th Congressional District mourn the passing
of Reverend Dr. W. Jerome Fisher and cele-
brate his service and remarkable work.
IN CELEBRATION OF JERRY
FISCHER
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 9, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the career of Jerry Fischer, a dedicated
servant and defender of the Jewish commu-
nity, who retired as executive director of the
Jewish Federation of Eastern Connecticut on
June 30, 2019, after leading the Federation
since 1984. Jerry lives in the state of Con-
necticut, where he has acted as a strength-
ening and unifying force for the state’s Jewish
community for thirty-five years.
Jerry is, and always has been, a bastion for
the preservation and prosperity of Connecti-
cut’s Jewish constituents. In his final year-end
report, he told the Jewish Federation’s board
of directors that the goal his three-decade ca-
reer was ‘‘to bring acts of loving kindness into
the community and the world.’’ Native to
Washington Heights, at 17 years old Jerry
made the journey from New York City to
Israel, where he spent a year, eventually mak-
ing the decision to join the Israeli army for the
Six Day War of June 1967. He cited this deci-
sion as a response to the Holocaust, the
genocide that brutally murdered 6 million of
his own people. His childhood in Washington
Heights places him in one of the epicenters of
the civil rights movements; Jerry took this ex-
perience and his time in Israel to create a ca-
reer of leadership based in compassion and
justice.
Determined to push the Jewish community
and the world forward, rather than back, Jerry
stood up in the face of Holocaust skeptics and
deniers and began the Encountering Survivors
program, which brought Holocaust survivors
and their family members face to face with
high school students so that their stories of
persecution and survival may live on through
younger generations. In one such case, Jerry
recruited 91-year-old Rae Gawendo, a Jewish
refugee who arrived in Connecticut in the
wake of the second World War, and, with the
help of the Jewish Agricultural Society, started
a chicken farm with her husband Jacob.
Gawendo was sent from the Vilna ghetto to
the Klooga work camp in 1942, where she
was forced to work in a sawmill that proc-
essed the very logs used to bum Jewish bod-
ies. She first spoke about her nightmare at a
Holocaust commemoration arranged by Jerry
Fischer, who later orchestrated meetings of
small groups of students in her home, who lis-
tened with rapt attention as she recounted the
truth of her life—before, during, and after the
war. Through interactions like these, Jerry cre-
ated lasting, crucial bonds between genera-
tions that solidified his place among the coun-
try’s leaders in indisputably preserving the
memory of the Holocaust.
Madam Speaker, Jerry has also been a
positive voice in Southeastern Connecticut
moral and social life, promoting solidarity with
other religious communities. Every Martin Lu-
ther King Day he has marched with Bishop
Watts of the Shiloh Baptist Church and hun-
dreds of other shivering members of the New
London County community to an ecumenical
observance of Martin Luther King’s life and
legacy. He has organized public forums to dis-
cuss the Middle East conflict, and has been a
voice of moderation, supporting a two-state
solution as a path to peace. He has led thou-
sands of Eastern Connecticut residents on
trips to the Middle East, and his fluency in He-
brew and encyclopedic knowledge of the Holy
Land educated all of his guests on the wonder
and deep spiritual history of that region. I per-
sonally experienced that a few years back
when he took me through Jerusalem and was
equally conversant on the Wailing Wall, Dome
of the Rock, and the Stations of the Cross in
a spellbinding tour that I will never forget. He
also rescued me from an unscrupulous vendor
in the marketplace who tried to overcharge me
for some religious souvenirs I naively almost
overpaid for. Thanks again Jerry.
Jerry has also been there to support the
community in sad and tragic moments. After
the sickening mass shooting at the Tree of
Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in
2018, Jerry joined local rabbis, ministers,
imams and priests to deliver a message of
love and resolve to end senseless hate and
gun violence in the media and at public
events. He is a quintessential leader for all of
us in Eastern Connecticut and we have been
blessed by his grace and wisdom.
Madam Speaker, although Jerry is stepping
down as Executive Director, he plans to con-
tinue to be an active member of the Jewish
community. In an editorial detailing the high-
lights of his career, The New London Day
wrote, ‘‘He and his wife Christine will remain
in the area, and we suspect his mitzvahs—his
acts of loving kindness—will continue, be-
cause that’s who Jerry Fischer is.’’ I would ask
the House to please join me in extending our
deepest gratitude to Jerry for his years of
service and dedication to the Jewish commu-
nity.
