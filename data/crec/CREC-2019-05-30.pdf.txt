PRAYER
Reverend Benjamin Hogue, Lutheran
Church of the Reformation, Wash-
ington, D.C., offered the following
prayer:
God of mercy and love, You have
journeyed with us this day and called
us to be a people of grace and peace.
The greatness of Your power tran-
scends all human authority.
Give to us a spirit of repentance and
wisdom, leading us in Your ways of hu-
mility and service. Grant strength to
this body and shape their work to be
bold and courageous in ensuring liberty
and justice for all.
Protect those who give voice to the
voiceless, and accompany those neigh-
bors most forgotten and pushed aside.
Hold close those who mourn, those who
hurt, and those seeking relief, refuge,
and rest. In sighs too deep for words,
intercede with Your comfort and care.
As Your love shows up continually in
our lives and in our world, give us the
courage to share Your compassion with
others in thought, word, and deed.
Guide us on paths of reconciliation and
unity, mending our hearts with Your
hope for a better world.
We pray all this, trusting that You
are near and knowing that You are lis-
tening.
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.

Mr. MASSIE led the Pledge of Alle-

lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS
ACT, 2019
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent to take from the Speak-
er’s table the bill (H.R. 2157) making
supplemental appropriations for the
fiscal year ending September 30, 2019,
and for other purposes, with the Senate
amendment thereto, and concur in the
Senate amendment.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. For
what purpose does the gentleman from
Tennessee seek recognition?
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, reserving the right to object.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized on his reserva-
tion.
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I am standing in a House
chamber that is virtually empty. Near-
ly all of my 431 colleagues are absent
as the Speaker of the House seeks to
pass a $19 billion spending bill.
Our Nation is $22 trillion in debt.
Trying to pass nearly $20 billion in new
spending while the majority of Con-
gress is not even in Washington re-
flects another act of irresponsible big
government.
This is absolutely, without a doubt,
wrong. It is no surprise that public
confidence in Congress is at historic
lows.
Every single Member could board a
plane today, and this issue could be
voted on in the next 12 hours.
We are each accountable to the
American people, who entrusted us
with their votes and sent us here to
work on their behalf. I am accountable
to the people of Tennessee, and I can
say with confidence: Tennesseans de-
serve better than what is being at-
tempted here today.
I never expected, when I came to
Washington, that I would be asked to
stay home while $19 billion is spent
without my vote.
I urge the Speaker of the House, who
is also not here today, to return to her

HONORING DAVID SCHORMANN
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize David
Schormann. David is a very special young
man who has exemplified the finest qualities
of citizenship and leadership by taking an ac-
tive part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop
389, and earning the most prestigious award
of Eagle Scout.
David has been very active with his troop,
participating in many scout activities. Over the
many years David has been involved with
scouting, he has not only earned numerous
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. David has also
contributed to his community through his
Eagle Scout project. For his project, David in-
stalled fishing line recycling stations through-
out a local lake, to ensure a higher quality of
life for wildlife within the area.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in commending David Schormann for his
accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH
AMENDMENT
HON. GARY J. PALMER
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, today is the
100th year anniversary of the United States
House of Representatives approving the reso-
lution for the 19th Amendment giving women
the right to vote. I have looked forward to this
day literally since my first day in Congress be-
cause it holds very special meaning for my
wife’s family.
Prior to the 1920 election, sample ballots
were distributed in Boston. My wife Ann’s
great-great-grandmother, Abby Mayhew Cush-
ing, received a sample ballot that she used to
prepare for that election. After voting that day
she wrote the following note on the back side
of the sample ballot, ‘‘November 2, 1920 Cast
my first vote for President of these United
States.’’
Reading those words gives a sense of the
immense pride that Ms. Cushing felt, a sincere
sense of patriotism at the opportunity to par-
ticipate in the selection of the leaders who
would guide as she wrote, ‘‘these United
States.’’
These United States . . . even though
women had been denied the right to vote
since the beginning of our nation, there was
no sense of resentment from Ms. Cushing,
only a sense of great pride that comes from a
genuine love of country.
To be totally transparent, I should include
the rest of what she wrote on the back of her
sample ballot. She wrote, ‘‘Straight Republican
ticket. Smashing victory for Harding and Coo-
lidge. Abby Mayhew Cushing Age 67’’
Almost three years later she added this
note: ‘‘President Harding died very suddenly
August 2nd 1923 in California. Burial in Mar-
ion, Ohio, Friday August 10th.’’
My wife and her family have held on to this
treasured piece of American history, with Ms.
Cushing’s simple yet inspiring words written
on the back, for almost 100 years as a re-
minder of how far our nation has come. It is
with great pride and honor that I share them
with this Congress on this 100th anniversary
of the passage of the House resolution to give
the women of America the right to vote.

HONORING PAUL SHUTE AND
KRISTEN P. FINNE
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing
two District of Columbia residents, Paul Shute
and Kristen P. Finne, 2019 Samuel J. Heyman
Service to America Medals finalists.
The Samuel J. Heyman Service to America
Medals (Sammies) are awarded each year to
honor outstanding federal employees who
have made significant contributions to our na-
tion. In this, its 18th year, the Sammies reward
efficient, effective problem solving in today’s
complex government. This year, two D.C. resi-
dents are among 26 other finalists for the
2019 Safety and Law Enforcement and Man-
agement Excellence categories. They were
nominated by their peers, federal employees,
and chosen from a pool of over 300 nominees
as finalists by the Partnership for Public Serv-
ice, a non-profit aimed at making the govern-
ment more effective. The winners of the
awards will be chosen in October 2019.
Paul Shute, a 2019 Safety and Law En-
forcement finalist, cut the amount of time it
takes to verify mental health claims for vet-
erans from 60 days to 6 minutes. At a time
when the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs
estimates that an average of 20 veterans com-
mit suicide every day, this innovative approach
is lifesaving and critical to providing veterans
with much-needed mental health benefits.
Kristen Finne, a 2019 Management Excel-
lence finalist, developed a system for first re-
sponders to quickly locate and assist 4.3 mil-
lion Medicare beneficiaries who rely on elec-
tricity-dependent medical equipment and are
at risk during prolonged power outages. Finne,
who works for the Department of Health and
Human Services in the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Preparedness and Response,
developed and led the emPOWER Program,
which consists of a database of Medicare
beneficiaries and weather and geographic in-
formation to identify, locate and assist vulner-
able members of the community during natural
disasters.
Please join me in recognizing Paul Shute
and Kristen P. Finne, finalists for the 2019
Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Med-
als.

HONORING BRUCE BENSON
HON. KEN BUCK
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I would like to
recognize Bruce Benson for his dedication and
service to the University of Colorado.
Bruce Benson is the longest-serving presi-
dent of the University of Colorado in more
than half a century. Since becoming the Presi-
dent of his alma mater in 2008, Bruce has en-
hanced the university’s standing as one of our
country’s leading public universities.
Throughout his tenure, he’s been a national
leader in ensuring that campuses are forums
for free speech, he has welcomed intellectual
diversity, and he has a long history of
bettering the lives of Coloradans. He will also
be remembered for the tremendous strides he
made to advance conservative thought and
policy, as well as his fundraising efforts to
support the Center for Western Civilization,
Thought and Policy at the University of Colo-
rado—Boulder.
Before joining the University of Colorado, he
established a career in business, where he
had been involved in banking, real estate,
cable television, and the restaurant industry.
He graduated from the University of Colorado
in 1964 with a Bachelor of Arts in Geology
and founded the Benson Mineral Group in
1965. Later, in 2009, he was named to the
Colorado Business Hall of Fame.
This July, Bruce will be retiring as the Presi-
dent of the University of Colorado system—
where he oversees four campuses and rough-
ly 70,000 students.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the 4th Con-
gressional District of Colorado, I would like to
thank Bruce for his service to our great state
of Colorado.

people, plants and animals. They have worked
in areas of policy, on-the-ground projects and
education on behalf of the river system.
Friends has educated more than 400,000 stu-
dents about science, nature and the environ-
ment; received over 200,000 visitors to its
McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Mu-
seum and have taken over 20,000 individuals
canoeing to build new and future advocates.
Each year, Friends Centennial Volunteers
and River Action Days attract over 6,000 vol-
unteers who participate in restoration activities
instream and on adjacent lands. Also, each
year, Friends’ Chicago River Day attracts
about 2,000 people to around 70 locations
across the Chicago region for a clean-up effort
that removes tons of litter from the waterway.
The organization has worked on behalf of the
Chicago River system to raise overall water
quality, foster healthier wildlife habitat, reduce
flooding, and raise public awareness of com-
bined sewer overflows.
Friends has grown from a handful of people
concerned about the neglect of the river sys-
tem to an organization of 10,000 members,
volunteers, and online advocates led by Exec-
utive Director, Margaret Frisbie, and Board
President, Sally Fletcher.
Generations of Chicagoans now value the
Chicago River system as an invaluable natural
resource.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating Friends of the Chicago
River for a long tradition of advocacy on be-
half of the Chicago River system and its 40th
Anniversary.

HONORING SANTIAGO HIGH
SCHOOL ON THEIR FIRST
LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP AND
FIRST APPEARANCE AT CIF
SOUTHERN SECTION FINALS
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I wish to
recognize the Santiago High School softball
team who recently won their first League
Championship in school history and made it all
the way to the CIF Southern Section Division
6 title game.
Santiago High School’s softball team truly
had a storybook season, with an overall reg-
ular season record of 23–1. This is the best
record in the school’s nearly 60-year history.
Additionally, Santiago High School went 9–
1 in league play, clinching their first Garden
Grove League Title. This was a moment of
great pride for the school. The team began
their extraordinary run through the CIF South-
ern Section Division 6 softball tournament as
the number one seed and dominated their way
through the playoffs.
Their coach, Melissa Adams, reached her
100th win during the 2nd round of the playoffs
becoming the first Santiago High School soft-
ball coach to reach 100 wins.
Melissa and her coaching staff, Tony Adams
and Manuel Cruz, led the team through an
outstanding playoff run that led to their first
title game in school history. While the team
made a valiant effort, they fell just short of the
title with a 3–2 loss.
The Santiago High School softball team has
truly been a dominating force on the softball
field this season and have so much to be
proud of. With only four seniors graduating,
they will truly be a force to be reckoned with
next season as they make a run for a Garden
Grove League dynasty. The team is truly a
special group of young women and I am proud
to recognize all of their accomplishments.

HONORING RONALD EDWARD
HOLLOWAY
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing one of the District of Colum-
bia’s great professional musicians, Ronald Ed-
ward Holloway.
Holloway, a native Washingtonian and prod-
uct of D.C. Public Schools, began playing sax-
ophone at a young age. Early on in his career,
he periodically played with the historic El
Corols Band and Show of Washington, D.C.
The first band that Holloway played with was
a Top 40 band called The Speculations based
out of Takoma Park, MD.
Holloway launched his professional career
in 1975 at the age of 21. He is described by
top jazz critics such as Stanley Crouch and Ira
Gitler as a ‘‘hard bearing down-hard-hopper
who can blow authentic jazz, R&B and can
croon a ballad with warm blue feeling, funk
and rock.’’
Holloway played tenor saxophone with the
great Gil Scott Heron for 14 years and was a
member of the world-renowned Dizzy Gillespie
Quintet. He was also a guest saxophonist with
Sonny Rollins, the Allman Brothers Band,
Gov’t Mule Band, Tedeschi Truck Band, Little
Feat Band, and Taj Mahal. Currently, he is the
director and saxophonist for his own band,
The Ron Holloway Band.
Holloway, a member of the D.C. Legendary
Musicians Inc., is the recipient of 42 music
awards, including several Wammie awards for
Musician of the Year.
I ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing and honoring Ronald Ed-
ward Holloway for his steadfast dedication to
promoting and preserving music in Wash-
ington, D.C.

COMMEMORATING THE 100TH
ANNIVERSARY OF CUMMINS INC.
HON. DARIN LaHOOD
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like
to recognize Cummins Inc. for celebrating their
100th anniversary. Cummins has become the
benchmark for engine design and engine re-
lated products.
In 1919, the Cummins Engine Company
began producing engines on a mass scale.
Since then, the company has grown im-
mensely; it now designs and manufactures a
wide variety of products. With operations all
over the globe, it makes me proud to say that
Cummins has a home in the 18th Congres-
sional District with its branch in Bloomington,
Illinois.
I extend my sincere congratulations to
Cummins Inc. for a successful 100 years, and
I wish them continued success going forward.

CONGRATULATING LONE STAR
ANALYSIS ON CONTINUED
GROWTH AND EXPANSION
HON. KENNY MARCHANT
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Lone Star Analysis on its
expansion and new corporate headquarters in
Addison, Texas, part of the 24th Congres-
sional District.
The Dallas-Fort Worth area has experienced
unabated growth over the last several years
due to its healthy economic climate for small
businesses and strong supply of highly-skilled
employees. Lone Star Analysis is a wonderful
example of this story. During my time serving
in the House of Representatives, Lone Star
Analysis has tripled its footprint in the Town of
Addison and increased employment by the
same ratio.
While enjoying significant growth, Lone Star
Analysis has also been an active community
partner. For example, Lone Star Analysis pro-
vided studies on improving federal procure-
ment to a committee within the United States
Congress. More recently, Lone Star Analysis
delivered a pioneering study on improving the
lives of inner-city children. These are two of
many examples of Lone Star Analysis going
above the call of duty and giving back to our
community and nation.
Lone Star Analysis serves key sectors of
the Texas economy including oil and gas,
aerospace, and manufacturing. Every day,
their analytics supports the critical mission of
many Fortune 500 companies, small busi-
nesses, and organizations including the Chief
of Naval Aviation Training, headquartered in
Corpus Christi, Texas, and the Air Education
and Training Command, headquartered in San
Antonio, Texas.
Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues
to join me in recognizing Lone Star Analysis

NATIONAL SOJOURNERS WEEK
HON. DON BACON
OF NEBRASKA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the National Sojourners for their
100th year of service to our nation and for Na-
tional Sojourners week which is June 3rd
through June 8th.
The National Sojourners was born of war-
time requirements and nurtured by the desire
of displaced military Masons to seek each oth-
er’s company, counsel and aid. Their purpose
is to organize current and former members of
the uniformed forces of the United States and
Honorary Members, who are Master Masons,
into Chapters to promote good fellowship, cul-
tivate Masonic ideals, support all patriotic aims
and activities in Masonry, and develop patriot-
ism and Americanism throughout the nation.
For a century, the National Sojourners have
counted among their ranks leaders from every
facet in American society. From three U.S.
Presidents, to Generals and Admirals, to our
junior enlisted personnel, National Sojourners
have served patriotically for the cause of free-
dom. Among their ranks have been several
Medal of Honor recipients, some of whom
made the supreme sacrifice to ensure our lib-
erty.
National Sojourners accomplishes its mis-
sion of education through 160 National So-
journer Chapters located throughout the
United States and Europe, as well as its
Headquarters located in Virginia, which pro-
vides support to all Chapters.
Love of country is promoted by local Chap-
ters through educational information and pro-
grams in Americanism and Patriotism specifi-
cally directed to the youth of our nation in the
form of Youth Leadership Conference scholar-
ships, high school- and college-level ROTC
Awards, and patriotic essay contests.
I would also like to welcome our military vet-
erans and National Sojourners to Nebraska,
the Heartland of America, where they will host
their Centennial Annual National Convention.
Thank you for your service and continued pa-
triotism for our country.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE EX-

ACY OF COACH OTIS WASH-

HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and
legacy of the late Coach Otis Washington. A
native of Selma, Alabama, Coach Washington
was a legendary football and Louisiana Hall of
Famer, who instilled in his players his winning
spirit, stalwart character and quest for excel-
lence. He led St. Augustine High School to
three state championships before moving on
to coach at LSU and Southern University.
Sadly, Coach Washington passed away on
Friday, May 24, 2019 at the age of 80.
Coach Washington was born on February
12, 1939 in Selma, Alabama to Sadie and Otis
Washington, Sr. He graduated from R.B. Hud-
son High School in 1957 where he was class
president and a star athlete. He then grad-
uated from Xavier University in New Orleans,
where he was the captain of the football team
and an All-Conference guard and linebacker.
A stellar all-around athlete, Coach Washington
also made Xavier’s All-Conference team in
baseball.
Coach Washington was a devout Catholic
and devoted member of the Immaculate Con-
ception Catholic Church in Baton Rouge, Lou-
isiana. His devotion to his faith began as a
young boy in Selma, Alabama, where he was
a member of the Don Bosco Catholic Boy’s
Club founded by Father Nelson Ziter in 1947.
Coach Washington’s résumé speaks for
itself. He led St. Augustine to state champion-
ships in 1975, 1978 and 1979, and in his 11
seasons there, he garnered a 113–17–1
record and guided the Purple Knights to 11
consecutive winning seasons and seven dis-
trict titles in their ultra-competitive league.
In 1979, Coach Washington became the
first African American football coach at LSU
when he joined the staff as an offensive line
coach. In 1981, Coach Washington was hired
as the head football coach at Southern Univer-
sity in Baton Rouge, where he led the Jaguars
for six seasons, until 1986.
His achievements on the football field led to
his induction into the Louisiana Sports Hall of
Fame in 2015 and the St. Augustine Hall of
Fame in 2017. He was also inducted into sev-
eral additional halls of fame, including: The
New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame—Out-
standing Prep Coach (1979); New Orleans
Sports Hall of Fame (1994); Louisiana High
School Athletic Association Sports Hall of
Fame (2012); Southern University Sports Hall
of Fame (2016); and Xavier University Hall of
Fame (2017).
His success on the football field was
matched by his many efforts in the community
to promote fairness, equity and justice.
‘‘Coach Wash,’’ as he was known by most,
was a key figure in the integration of the Lou-
isiana High School Athletic Association
(LHSAA). Three years before Coach Wash-
ington took over at St. Augustine, a lawsuit al-
lowed the school to compete in the LHSAA,
rather than the all-black Louisiana Inter-
scholastic Athletic and Literary Organization.
St. Augustine, led by Coach Washington, often
found itself caught in the middle of a chang-
ing, difficult social environment, and on the
losing end of many officials’ calls. In 1970,
when all-black St. Augustine team faced off
against an all-white team in Chalmette, the
team was escorted by police. On the field, the
players were surrounded by a dozen officers
and police dogs. Despite the environment,
though, the team, persevered and eventually
made it to the state championship—and won.
While Coach Washington was often quick to
downplay his role in integrating the league and
said he did not see himself as a civil rights
leader, his guidance opened doors of oppor-
tunity for countless members of the African
American community, and many of his players
credit his leadership with the team’s persist-
ence and determination to make it to the state
finals, despite the difficult racial social climate.
He demanded discipline and attention to detail
from both his players and assistant coaches at
every level of the game, from St. Augustine to
LSU. These lessons remained with his players
even after they had hung up their cleats.
Coach Washington is survived by his wife of
over 52 years, Linda Patterson Washington of
Baton Rouge, whom he met while coaching at
St. Augustine; his siblings, Carol C. Black,
Olivia Washington, Charlene W. Brown,
Theopolis, Sr. (Jacqueline), Sharon D. Wil-
liams (Tyrone R., Sr.), Irma Ruth McQueen,
and many godchildren, special grandchildren,
nieces, nephews, relatives and friends.
On a personal note, I knew this amazing
man as my ‘‘Uncle Otis.’’ He was one of my
father’s best childhood friends. Uncle Otis, my
dad, Charles Williams and Ted Washington re-
ferred to themselves as the ‘‘Four Amigos’’ in
grammar school, a name that stuck throughout
their lifetimes. These men never forgot the les-
sons they learned from Father Nelson Ziter at
the Don Bosco Boy’s Club of Selma, nor the
friendship that bound them forever. They
shared a deep love of their hometown of
Selma and a commitment to service through
sports.
Uncle Otis and Auntie Linda were a con-
stant presence in the lives of my twin brothers
and me. I could always count on them for
words of encouragement and boasts of pride
in my accomplishments. I know that I stand
today as Alabama’s first black Congress-
woman because of the love, support, nurturing
and prayers of the mentors, family and friends
like Uncle Otis. Like my dad, Coach Otis
Washington will be missed, but never forgot-
ten. The legacy Uncle Otis leaves behind will
live on in the many lives that he impacted.
May we find comfort in knowing that his leg-
end lives in us, and we are stronger and bet-
ter because Uncle Otis’ light shines bright
within us.
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring the extraordinary life and legacy of
Selma, Alabama native Coach Otis Wash-
ington, a football coaching legend and Lou-
isiana Hall of Famer. May we celebrate the to-
tality of his life today and honor always his
great accomplishments in sports and contribu-
tions in shaping the hearts, minds and char-
acter of men.

HONORING HECTOR GODINEZ FUN-
DAMENTAL HIGH SCHOOL FOR
THEIR FIRST CIF SOUTHERN
SECTION SOFTBALL CHAMPION-
SHIP
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I wish to
recognize the Hector Godinez Fundamental
High School softball team who recently won
their first CIF Southern Section Championship
in school history.
On Saturday, May 18, the softball team
clinched their first ever title, defeating El
Segundo High School by a score of 15–1, be-
coming the CIF Southern Section Division 4
Champions. They won all five of the CIF
games by five or more runs, making a domi-
nating run to the championship.
It has been a truly outstanding season for
both Godinez Fundamental High School soft-
ball and the City of Santa Ana. Their head
coach, Ed Medina, has been the coach since
the school opened in 2007 and was named
the 2019 Orange County Softball Coach of the
Year. His assistant coaches are Clarissa
Castellanos, Kevin Pola, and Selene Pola.
In 2017, they made it to the CIF-SS Semi
Finals and in 2018, they made it to the 2nd
round of playoffs. This season, they outdid
themselves with an overall regular season
record of 21–4. They won the Golden West
League Championship, with an undefeated
record of 10–0 in their first year in the league.
This is their fourth league championship in a
row, previously winning three Orange Coast
League Championships in 2016, 2017, and
2018.
The Hector Godinez Fundamental High
School softball team has truly been a domi-
nating force on the softball field this season,
especially during the playoffs. They have six
graduating seniors and many more returning,
and I am confident they will be a force to be
reckoned with in the 2020 High School softball
season. The team is truly a special group of
young women and I am proud of all their ac-
complishments. Congratulations again on
being the 2019 CIF Southern Section Division
4 softball champions.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO AGENTS AND

HON. JOHN R. CARTER
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker,
the mission of U.S. Customs and Border Pro-
tection (CBP) is broad and diverse. The men
and women of CBP protect our borders at and
between ports of entry. They protect the
American people against terrorists and the in-
struments of terror. They enforce the laws of
the United States while fostering our Nation’s
economic security through lawful international
trade and travel. CBP employees provide self-
less service to their nation and they do so with
honor and distinction under an ever-present
threat.
As a former judge, I know firsthand the es-
sential role law enforcement officers play in
maintaining law and order and the risks they
face every time they report for duty. I would
like to pay tribute to the agents and officers
who lost their lives in the service of our Na-
tion. While their watches have ended, the leg-
acy and the commitment of all who wear the
badge live on.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E687
May 30, 2019
As a young man, Roy Appleton, Jr. served
in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II.
He saw combat action for more than 35
months in the South Pacific, taking part in the
invasion of Iwo Jima and fighting in multiple
battles including the retaking Guadalcanal and
Saipan.
Upon his return home to Texas, Mr. Apple-
ton married Margie Lee Monroe of Denton in
1947. He earned a degree from the University
of North Texas in 1949. Even before he grad-
uated, Mr. Appleton began working at the
Denton Record-Chronicle. He was employed
by the paper for more than four decades, retir-
ing in 1991 as president and general man-
ager. Aside from his service in the U.S. Ma-
rine Corps, Mr. Appleton spent his entire ca-
reer at the paper.
An engaged community leader, Mr. Apple-
ton served in a variety of leadership roles for
the Denton Chamber of Commerce, the Den-
ton Economic Development Advisory Board,
and United Way of Denton County. He was an
active member of the Denton Rotary Club and
Denton Jaycees, as well as a director of First
State Bank and a ruling elder at St. Andrew
Presbyterian Church.
In 2014, the Greater Denton Arts Council re-
named their home the ‘‘Patterson-Appleton
Center for the Visual Arts’’ in recognition of
Mr. Appleton’s contributions to the art culture
of Denton County, which include the creation
of the Campus Theatre, annual Holiday Light-
ing Festival, and Denton Arts & Jazz Festival.
In recognition of his many contributions to
the North Texas community, the Greater Den-
ton Arts Council (GDAC) will honor Mr. Apple-
ton’s legacy of philanthropy and civic engage-
ment at its annual awards event on May 31,
2019.
I am grateful for Mr. Appleton’s many dec-
ades of selfless service to our nation and our
community. On behalf of the 26th District of
Texas, I offer my condolences to his family,
friends, and neighbors.

COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF PIKE COUNTY
FARM BUREAU
HON. DARIN LaHOOD
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like
to honor a remarkable organization, the Pike
County Farm Bureau. The Pike County Farm
Bureau in central Illinois is a vital organization
in the area that promotes agricultural pros-
perity. After many years of success and serv-
ice, the Pike County Farm Bureau is cele-
brating their 100th anniversary.
The Pike County Farm Bureau was char-
tered on May 10, 1919, to unite farmers in the
area and advocate for central Illinois agri-
culture collectively. Today, the group has
2,200 members supporting the community and
economy throughout the county.
The Pike County Farm Bureau provides a
voice for farmers, promotes the development
of agriculture, and educates and empowers fu-
ture leaders in the industry. Additionally, Pike
County Farm Bureau coordinates with other
associations and agencies to promote the
well-being and interests of its members.
Illinois has become a major economic force
within the agricultural sector because of farm
bureaus like Pike County that come together
and enhance opportunities for farmers, their
families, and the community. I extend my sin-
cere congratulations to Pike County Farm Bu-
reau for their outstanding accomplishments
and contributions to Illinois.

HONORING THE WORK OF MICHAEL
KAHN
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Michael Kahn, who is stepping down
from the Shakespeare Theatre Company
(STC) after 33 years as Artistic Director, hav-
ing revolutionized the performance of Shake-
speare and classical theater in Washington,
D.C. Kahn helped to transform D.C. theater
from a small scene to the fastest growing pro-
fessional theater community in the nation, re-
nowned for its variety of theatrical productions.
Kahn believes that theater should be acces-
sible and affordable to all, so he instituted pro-
grams such as Free For All, offering free per-
formances of a Shakespearean classic to the
general public each summer, the Happenings
Happy Hour, offers free performances of local
artists, musicians, and performers of a wide
variety of disciplines, and the FREE WILL pro-
gram, offering free tickets for every STC
mainstage production in the season. Over
700,000 people have attended a free Shake-
speare play, and over 90,000 young people
have seen student matinee productions of
classic works.
Kahn has built connections between clas-
sical theater and the political life of Wash-
ington, D.C. with contemporary and urgent
productions of Shakespeare and beloved
events such as the annual Mock Trial, pre-
sided over by Justices of the Supreme Court.
I have had the opportunity to perform several
times in Will on the Hill, a comedy perform-
ance based on Shakespeare’s works featuring
Members of Congress, fostering bipartisan
support for arts education. STC serves stu-
dents in every traditional D.C. public and pub-
lic charter high school, providing in-school
workshops, free supplemental materials and
free or deeply subsidized tickets and transpor-
tation to theatrical performances.
Kahn’s dedication to theater education can
be seen through his various roles over the
years, such as his tenure as Richard Rodgers
Director of the Drama Division at the Juilliard
School and his time as faculty at New York
University Graduate School of the Arts, the
Circle in the Square Theater School and
Princeton University. He brought that expertise
to Washington, D.C., where he launched the
Academy for Classical Acting, a one-year
master’s program at The George Washington
University, which has been preparing the next
generation of classically trained actors for 20
years.
Kahn’s visionary work has brought national
and international recognition, including a Re-
gional Theater Tony Award in 2012 for STC,
and personal honors such as an induction as
Honorary Commander of the Most Excellent
Order of the British Empire and a Lifetime
Achievement Award from the Hall of Fame.
During his Artistic Directorship, STC has gar-
nered 104 Helen Hayes Awards and 442
nominations, with Kahn receiving nine wins for
Outstanding Direction and an additional 12
nominations.
I ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing Michael Kahn for his leader-
ship, his theatrical innovations and farsighted
initiatives, and a life devoted to the theater.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOYCE
HOWARD PITTMAN
HON. KENNY MARCHANT
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to ask all of my colleagues to join me
in honoring the life and legacy of Joyce How-
ard Pittman of Irving, Texas.
Born in Dallas, Texas on August 31, 1940,
Joyce Howard Pittman had a passion for fam-
ily and serving others from a young age.
Growing up in the Dallas suburb of Rylie,
Texas, Joyce spent many days working in the
fields as the child of a farmer. Her father, O.B.
Howard, and mother, Thelma Louis Hiser
Howard, worked to instill in her the values of
hard work and personal responsibility. From
early on, it was clear that Joyce was a natural
servant leader and entrepreneur.
In June 1958, Joyce met Clyde Pittman at
the Dallas Farmers Market, just south of
downtown Dallas. Clyde and Joyce were mar-
ried almost 61 years and together they had
two children, Craig Howard Pittman and
Clarissa Dawn Pittman Lindsey. While Clyde
served in the United States Air Force, Joyce
traveled with him on assignment to destina-
tions including Omaha, Nebraska and San An-
gelo, Texas. Their growing family soon settled
in Irving, Texas where Joyce began to engage
in local politics. She was one of the founders
of the Irving Republican Women’s Club where
she served in various capacities and leader-
ship roles. Additionally, Joyce served as a Re-
publican Party Precinct Chair in Dallas County
and was a fixture at election time in her neigh-
borhood where she walked blocks and made
phone calls for local, state, and national can-
didates.
In April of 1974, at the age of 33, Joyce was
elected to the Irving City Council. Joyce was
the first woman ever elected to the city council
and helped pave the way for many women
leaders in Irving and the North Texas commu-
nity that would follow her. Throughout Joyce’s
time serving as a councilmember, she was
known as a consensus builder and a cham-
pion of good government. Following her serv-
ice on the city council, Joyce joined the North
Texas Commission as a consultant. Again,
serving as the first woman in this role, Joyce
worked to foster economic prosperity in the
North Texas region.
Throughout her life, Joyce had an entrepre-
neurial spirit. As a small business owner,
Joyce operated a residential building business
which thrived during significant growth in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area during the 1980s. In
the late 1990s, Joyce and Clyde took over an
Odessa, Texas telecommunications company,
DMJ Communications. Joyce served as the
COO and commuted weekly from Irving to op-
erate the organization.
In 2012, Joyce was diagnosed with multiple
myeloma. During Joyce’s battle, she remained

an eternal optimist by confronting the chal-
lenge with grace and fortitude. Up until her
passing, Joyce continued to do the things she
enjoyed the most including spending time with
her family and grandchildren, attending Plym-
outh Park United Methodist Church, and mak-
ing phone calls for her favorite local can-
didates.
Madam Speaker, I extend sincere condo-
lences to the Pittman family and I ask all of
my colleagues to join me in honoring the life

REMEMBERING ROBERT JAMES
GLASS
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the memory and service of
Robert James Glass, a 40-year Yuba City
resident who embodied the American spirit of
enduring dedication to his family and country.
Born on December 4, 1927, Robert joined
the U.S. Merchant Marine at age 16 to fight in
the Pacific Theater during World War II.
Through his service as a merchant mariner
during the war, Robert joined in an effort that
proved to be an instrumental asset on an un-
told number of occasions.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt stated in
1944 that the Merchant Marine had ‘‘delivered
the goods when and where needed in every
theater of operations and across every ocean
in the biggest, the most difficult, and dan-
gerous transportation job ever undertaken. As
time goes on, there will be greater public un-
derstanding of our merchant fleet’s record dur-
ing this war.’’ It was in that ultimately vic-
torious cause that Robert volunteered to lend
his hand.
Following the war, Robert served 22 years
in the U.S. Air Force, including deployments
across the world. He retired as a Master Ser-
geant at Beale AFB, California. Through his
active engagement in local organizations such
as the American Legion he remained a dedi-
cated member of the Yuba City community
until his passing.
He is survived by his three sons, Robert,
Richard and Bruce and their families. I know
that they, along with the rest of his family and
friends, join me in celebrating his life and his
memory.

HONORING NATIONAL FOSTER
CARE MONTH
HON. JOHN LEWIS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I rise in honor
of National Foster Care Month, which has
been observed in May for more than thirty
years, and to speak about an issue that af-
fects foster children and families across Amer-
ica.
Too many children dream of a stable, lov-
ing, family. Many adults want to open their
homes and their hearts, but they face barriers
because the system says that they practice
the wrong religion, love the wrong person, or
are not married.
My friends, this is discrimination. It is not
right, not fair, and not just.
I am proud to sponsor the Every Child De-
serves a Family Act to change that. This bill
is the right thing to do, and quite frankly, it is
long overdue.
It does not matter whether we are gay or
straight, married or single, Christian, Jewish,
or Muslim. It does not matter whether we
practice all religions or no religion. It does not
matter whether we are African American,
Latino, Native American, Asian American, or
white.
We are all one people, one country.
And we must each do our part to ensure
that every young person and aspiring parent is
able to enjoy the dream of a loving, stable
family.
I look forward to reintroducing the Every
Child Deserves a Family Act next week.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE LIFE
AND LEGACY OF THERESA TUR-
NER BURROUGHS
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and
legacy of the late Theresa Turner Burroughs.
Mrs. Burroughs, a champion of the right to
vote, was a beloved member of the Hale
County community who, through grace, grit
and love, helped move her hometown of
Greensboro, Alabama towards a more just
and equal future. Sadly, Mrs. Burroughs
passed away on Wednesday, May 22, 2019 at
the age of 89.
Mrs. Burroughs was the youngest of eleven
children born to Mr. and Mrs. Napoleon and
Mattie Turner near Moundville, Alabama on
August 14, 1928. Due to a flood, the family
moved to Greensboro, Alabama, where she
remained throughout her life. Mrs. Burroughs
graduated from Hale County Training School
in 1946 and later from the Bestita School of
Beauty. She was married to the late Walter
Kenneth Burroughs, who retired from the
United States Army. Mrs. Burroughs was the
mother of four children: Paula Renee, Kathy
Sue, Leslie Erroll and Toni Teresa.
From a young age, Mrs. Burroughs became
fascinated by the right to vote and wondered
why that right was solely given to white citi-
zens in the Black Belt. During the Jim Crow
era, the board of registrars at Alabama’s Hale
County Courthouse prevented African Ameri-
cans from registering to vote. Undeterred, she
went to the Hale County Courthouse to reg-
ister to vote on the first and third Monday of
each month, where she sometimes waited for
hours before being tested with irrelevant ques-
tions. She was quizzed on how many red jelly
beans there were in a jar and was asked to
recite the second line of the second paragraph
of the U.S. Constitution and the American
Creed, among other tasks, but was denied the
right to vote time after time. After two long
years, Mrs. Burroughs’ determination paid off,
and she successfully registered to vote.
Mrs. Burroughs carried these experiences
with her throughout her life. Mrs. Burroughs
said it was a joy to finally be able to cast her
ballot but remarked that it should not have
been so difficult to do so. She knew just how
precious her right to vote was and worked
hard to ensure her own voice and those of all
the citizens in the Greensboro community
were counted at the ballot box. She never
missed a chance to exercise that sacred right,
voting in elections at every level.
Mrs. Burroughs showed the depth of her
bravery and dedication to the Civil Rights
Movement when she marched over the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on
March 7, 1965 along with hundreds of other
Foot Soldiers to protest for their right to vote.
That day, Bloody Sunday, she was brutally
beaten and arrested by state troopers and
sheriff’s deputies.
Mrs. Burroughs is best known for her stew-
ardship of the ‘‘Safe House Museum’’ in
Greensboro, Alabama, which she founded in
2002. The museum is located in the same
house where local residents hid Rev. Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. from the Ku Klux Klan on
a visit to West Alabama in 1968. The Safe
House Museum is a reminder of the pivotal
role the Black Belt of Alabama played in the
Civil Rights Movement. It houses photographs,
biographies and historical artifacts to docu-
ment and educate future generations about
the local struggle for the right to vote. The
walls of the museum are lined with mug shots
of Foot Soldiers, including one of Mrs. Bur-
roughs holding a towel and glasses to protect
her eyes from tear gas. A black ’’X’’ police

drew on the bottom of her mug shot signifies
her status as a leader among the marchers.
Mrs. Burroughs always sought greater
equality in her community and demanded to
be treated equally, igniting her career and
passion for advocacy. Never one to back
down, she continued her efforts as an activist
leading the Hale County Civic Improvement
League, one of the oldest grassroots civil
rights organizations in the nation. The organi-
zation was instrumental in sparking change in
Greensboro and Hale County by soliciting and
supporting minority candidates to run for local
office, including city council, county commis-
sion, sheriff, school board and more.
She remained engaged and active in her
community throughout her life and helped
elect Greensboro’s first African American
Mayor, John Owens. Her exemplary reputation
and prominence in Hale County drove many
political candidates, both local and regional, to
seek her council and support for their cam-
paigns. Mrs. Burroughs also was instrumental
in securing various programs for the city of
Greensboro and Hale County, and led the
charge to rename Depot Street to Martin Lu-
ther King Drive.
On a personal note, I am deeply honored
that I got to know Mrs. Burroughs as one of
the real matriarchs of the Civil Rights Move-
ment in Alabama. Mrs. Burroughs was instru-
mental as the keeper of the archives sur-
rounding the role that Greensboro, Alabama
played protecting Dr. King from the KKK in
1968. As founder of the Safe House Museum,
it was because of her efforts that future gen-
erations will learn about the sacrifices and
bravery of so many known and unknown Foot
Soldiers for justice. Mrs. Burroughs honored
me by attending my first election night victory
party in November 2010 in Selma, when I was
elected Alabama’s first black Congresswoman.
I celebrated her as one of the ‘‘Black Women
Pioneers in Alabama’’ that night. So many of
us stand on the broad shoulders of Mrs. The-
resa Burroughs that her bright light will always
glow through the many lives that she has im-
pacted.
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in re-
membering the exemplary life of Theresa Tur-
ner Burroughs, a civil rights icon and a true
American heroine, who helped change Ala-
bama and the entire nation for the better. May
we celebrate the totality of her life today and
honor her great contributions to the Civil
Rights Movement.

ACKNOWLEDGING THE HONOR
GUARD OF AMERICAN LEGION
POST NO. 56 AND NO. 635
HON. DARIN LaHOOD
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to acknowledge the remarkable work that the
Honor Guard of Bloomington American Legion
Post No. 56 and Normal American Legion
Post No. 635 do for our community. The
Bloomington-Normal Honor Guard is an inte-
gral organization for veterans and their fami-
lies in Central Illinois.
The Bloomington and Normal Posts have
worked together for decades to ensure the
Honor Guard Units are there to provide irre-
placeable services for the veterans in our
community. Over the past twelve years, the
Bloomington-Normal Honor Guard has con-
ducted over 1,000 funerals and 500 Color
Guard events.
Not only do Post No. 56 and Post No. 635
serve veterans and their families, but they also
work to improve the well-being of our commu-
nity. Over the past 25 years, both posts have
presented the colors at the Illinois Special
Olympics State Track and Field competition at
Illinois State University. Also, Post No. 56 and
Post No. 635 Honor Guard played a significant
role at the dedication ceremony for the renam-
ing of the Normal Post Office in honor of Sgt.
Joshua Rodgers, which my office and I helped
to facilitate.
I would like to thank the Bloomington Amer-
ican Legion Post No. 56 and Normal American
Legion Post No. 635 for their commitment and
service to our veteran community.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing the good works of the
Bloomington-Normal American Legion Post
Honor Guard Members. I include in the
RECORD the names of the Honor Guard mem-
bers.

IN RECOGNITION OF BRYNN
BROWN AND ELI STOWERS
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 30, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to congratulate Guyer High School sopho-
mores Brynn Brown and Eli Stowers, who re-
cently won gold medals at the 2019 UIL Texas
State Track and Field meet.
The students’ victories are well-earned. Fol-
lowing her regional meet, Ms. Brown was a
self-proclaimed underdog. At the beginning of
her mile run, Ms. Brown was seeded fourth in
a competitive array of runners. Despite these
circumstances, she finished first with a mile
time of 4.48 minutes. Impressively, Ms. Brown
won a second gold medal in the 3,200-meter
run.
In the high jump competition, Mr. Stowers
reached a remarkable 6 feet and 10 inches to
claim the gold medal. Persevering through in-
clement weather, he rose to the challenge—a
testament to his hard work and diligent prepa-
ration.
I commend Guyer High School track and
field coaches Jonathan Ponsonby, Megan
Hardesty, and Aaron Roberts for their leader-
ship and dedication. It is a privilege to rep-
resent Guyer High School in the U.S. House
of Representatives. I am pleased to recognize
the achievements of Brynn Brown and Eli
Stowers, and I wish them continued success
in their athletic and academic endeavors.
