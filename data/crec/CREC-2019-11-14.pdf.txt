DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE

fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,
November 14, 2019.
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on
this day.
NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
f

f
NAFTA ANNIVERSARY AND USMCA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, this coming Sunday
marks the 26th anniversary of the
House of Representatives passing the
North American Free Trade Agree-
ment, or NAFTA.
This agreement with our two closest
trading partners, Canada and Mexico,
has become outdated as time has
passed, markets have diversified, and
economies have flourished. We are in
desperate need of updating NAFTA to
meet modern-day economic demands.
I know many of us have staff who are
younger than NAFTA, and we can all
agree that the world has changed an
awful lot in the last three decades.
Congress needs to bring the United
States-Mexico-Canada trade agree-
ment, or USMCA, to a vote imme-
diately to keep trade free and fair. A
vote on USMCA is long overdue.
It has been more than 400 days since
President Trump announced this his-
toric agreement, and Mexico and Can-
ada have already given USMCA the
green light. For farmers, ranchers,
manufacturers, and everyone in be-
tween, we must follow suit. So many
different industries can benefit from a
modern trade agreement.
In Pennsylvania, nearly 43,000 jobs
depend on manufacturing exports to
Canada and Mexico. Last year alone,
Pennsylvania exported $15 billion
worth of products to Canada and Mex-
ico.
There is no telling what economic po-
tential lies ahead with a new revamped
trade agreement.
In Pennsylvania, agriculture—and
dairy, in particular—is the backbone of
the Commonwealth’s economy.
USMCA’s elimination of Canada’s Class
6 and Class 7 dairy pricing programs
would be a big win for dairy farm fami-
lies. These programs have unfairly lim-
ited our export potential over the
years.
The signing of USMCA into law will
also signal to other major trade part-
ners, like China and Japan, that we are
serious about these kinds of deals and
we are committed to a bright future for
American exports.
There is no reason why we cannot
pass USMCA before the end of the year.
USMCA will create more jobs, boost
wages, and spur the Nation’s economy.
What are we waiting for? Each day
that passes without a vote is a missed
opportunity. Let’s get to work and hold
a vote immediately.
f
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. HOYER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we are in-
volved in a very serious process to de-
termine whether the President of the
United States has committed high
crimes and misdemeanors.
The Constitution provides for the re-
moval of high officials who violate
their oath of office, who violate the
powers of their office, and who commit
bribery or treason, or high crimes and
misdemeanors.
In the course of that process, we have
been involved with numerous people
asking for the whistleblower to testify.
I will not speak to the substance of the
consideration that is ongoing with re-
spect to the impeachment of the Presi-
dent of the United States, but I do
want to speak pointedly to the calls
from so many that the whistleblower
be identified.
The whistleblower, of course, has no
direct evidence to offer. What the whis-
tleblower is is somebody who responded
to ‘‘if you see something, say some-
thing.’’
We have witnesses to wrongdoing all
over this country and all over the
world, and our police departments have
a line that is called an anonymous tip
line so that somebody who sees some-
thing will say something. It is anony-
mous so that we do not intimidate
those people or expose them to danger
for coming forward to out criminal be-
havior.
The President of the United States
has made an analogy to this informa-
tion coming forward as the result of
spying, treason, which, as we all know,
according to the President, can subject
someone to capital punishment.
Why do we have a whistleblower stat-
ute? We have a whistleblower statute,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8830 November 14, 2019
Mr. Speaker, because we want to en-
courage people, and we want to not ex-
pose them to danger or intimidation—
including from the most powerful per-
son on Earth, the President of the
United States—or retaliation. Yet we
continue to hear: Tell us who the whis-
tleblower is. Let us throw the whistle-
blower into the lion’s den.
In fact, of course, what we do know is
the whistleblower, the information
that was brought forward, A, led to the
release of funds to the Ukrainians just
shortly thereafter and, in addition, has
led to substantive testimony corrobo-
rating the information that the whis-
tleblower either saw or heard.
If you see something, say something.
It is irresponsible, it is wrong, and, in
fact, in almost every jurisdiction, there
are criminal penalties for threatening
a witness, for impeding justice.
So, Mr. Speaker, when people say,
‘‘Show me the whistleblower,’’ what
they are doing is not only trying to in-
timidate that whistleblower, they are
trying to intimidate every other whis-
tleblower who might deign to come for-
ward because they saw something or
heard something.
I would hope all of my colleagues
would think to themselves: Why do we
have a whistleblower statute?
I represent 62,000 Federal employees,
and, very frankly, I want them to have
the confidence to come forward if they
see wrongdoing in the Federal Govern-
ment, even if it is about the President
of the United States, and even if the
President of the United States wants
to make an analogy to a capital of-
fense—despicable—undermining the
very essence of why the Congress of the
United States enacted a whistleblower
statute and the essence of why police
departments all over the United States
have anonymous tip lines and why al-
most every State has a statute which
imposes a criminal penalty for the in-
timidation of witnesses.
We are a nation of laws, not of men.
We are proud of that. But if we are to
be a nation whose top leaders try to in-
timidate those who would come for-
ward if they see something or hear
something and they say something,
then we will be a lesser nation, less fo-
cused on a nation of laws.
Mr. Speaker, I would hope that Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle, political
pundits, commentators, and, yes, the
President of the United States would
cease and desist from trying to intimi-
date this whistleblower and all of those
who may be whistleblowers.
The intent of that legislation, the in-
tent of those protections, the intent of
witness protection statutes and intimi-
dation of witnesses is so that we will
get at the truth and that our govern-
ment of the people, by the people, and
for the people will be more honest, will
be more safe, will be more just.
f
TRACED ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to discuss an issue that has afflicted
nearly every American, including me,
and it is the influx of annoying and de-
ceptive robocalls. These seemingly end-
less automated calls disrupt every part
of our daily lives, constitute a serious
form of harassment, and expose mil-
lions of Americans to dangerous finan-
cial scams.
A prime example of the insidious na-
ture of these calls occurred last year in
New York when scammers pretended to
be from the Chinese consulate and de-
manded money from people with what
they considered to be Chinese-sounding
last names. As a result, 21 Chinese im-
migrants lost a total of $2.5 million.
In another instance, scammers at-
tempted to phish personal information
by calling people and threatening them
with fines unless they signed up for
health insurance.
These incidences are financially dev-
astating and are happening to far too
many people across our country. If
there is one thing Republicans and
Democrats should be able to agree on is
that Congress can no longer sit back
and ignore this problem. Our efforts
must be focused on adding teeth to the
Federal Government’s ability to detect
and punish individuals and organiza-
tions that abuse automated dialing
technology.
With that in mind, I am proud to be
a cosponsor of the TRACED Act, intro-
duced by my friend, DAVID KUSTOFF.
This legislation expands the penalties
and the timeframes under which the
Federal Communications Commission
can identify robocallers and pursue
civil action. This is entirely bipartisan,
and it passed the Senate, last May, 97–
1.
Under the TRACED Act, the FCC will
be able to impose fines of up to $10,000
for each individual scam call. Cur-
rently, telemarketing scammers face a
maximum fine of only $1,500. I am con-
fident that increasing the maximum
penalty up to $10,000 will deter many
scammers by making the cost of get-
ting caught simply too expensive.
To make these harsher penalties the
norm and not the exception, the FCC
needs to be given more time to find the
perpetrators of illegal robocalls. If the
TRACED Act becomes law, the period
in which the source of a robocall can be
investigated and found liable will be
tripled from 1 year to 3 years.
This important provision will work
in lockstep with the increased fines.
The FCC has told Congress that ex-
tending the statute of limitations in
this way would improve the Commis-
sion’s enforcement efforts.
During my time in office, I have
heard frustration from countless con-
stituents on this issue. Robocalls fre-
quently interrupt our daily lives, ring-
ing our phones during important work-
hours, and distracting us from time
spent at home with our families.
The TRACED Act is an important bi-
partisan bill that is supported by attor-
neys general in all 50 States, along
with FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.
As scammers adjust the way they
perpetrate fraud on the American peo-
ple, it seems like common sense that
our laws should be updated to fight
back. No matter which side of the aisle
we find ourselves on, we should all be
able to agree that it is time for these
illegal robocalls to be stopped once and
for all.

HONORING THE LIFE OF
THADDEUS SEYMOUR, SR.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Florida (Mrs. MURPHY) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to honor Thaddeus Seymour,
Sr., who passed away recently at the
age of 91.
In the obituary that appeared in our
local, hometown paper, the Orlando
Sentinel, Thad was described by one of
his many admirers as a community
treasure, and I think that sums up his
life and legacy perfectly.
Thad moved with his beloved wife,
Polly, and their children to the Or-
lando area over 40 years ago when Thad
was named the 12th president of Rol-
lins College, where I had the privilege
to teach before being elected to Con-
gress.
Thad served for a dozen years as the
president of Rollins, from 1978 to 1990,
and although he had long left by the
time I arrived, his name was spoken on
campus with respect and affection.
Thad was recognized as a popular and
effective leader of the institution, help-
ing make this gem of a school shine
even brighter.
One decision Thad made during his
tenure may seem modest, but it was
meaningful to people who know Rollins
best. In the 1950s, one of Thad’s prede-
cessors established Fox Day. Each
spring, as finals loomed and on a day
considered too beautiful to sit in a
classroom, the school’s president would
cancel classes and provide students
with a surprise day off.
The tradition was ended during the
Vietnam war, but Thad brought it
back. As Thad would recall years later:
‘‘The world had grown so grim, I
thought we needed to cheer ourselves
up.’’ It is a choice that underscores
both Thad’s love of life and his belief
that, at core, a college should be a
close-knit community where young
men and women live together; learn to-
gether; and, in many cases, become
lifelong friends. Because Fox Day
helped foster a sense of community and
shared experience, Thad believed it
mattered.
Thad left Rollins in 1990, but he never
left central Florida, and he never
stopped caring about our community.
In fact, he literally helped build it, co-
founding a chapter of Habitat for Hu-
manity in Winter Park and in
Maitland.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8831
November 14, 2019
There is a wonderful picture of Thad
in the Orlando Sentinel obituary. He is
helping construct a home for someone
less fortunate. He is perched on a lad-
der. His shirt is splattered with paint.
He has a broad smile on his face. That
is how I will always remember Thad:
happily helping, happily building.
May President Seymour rest in
peace.
f
RECOGNIZING FORMER MIS-
SISSIPPI SPEAKER BILLY MCCOY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Mississippi (Mr. KELLY) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
former speaker of the Mississippi
House of Representatives, the Honor-
able Billy McCoy, who is pictured here.
Former Mississippi Speaker Billy
McCoy passed away on November 12
after an incredible, lifelong career of
public service.
Billy was directly responsible for rev-
olutionizing the economy of Mis-
sissippi and bringing thousands of jobs
to our great State. As speaker, Speaker
McCoy championed the 1987 infrastruc-
ture plan that created four-lane high-
ways throughout Mississippi. The four-
lane highways brought industries and
added more than 1,300 miles of high-
ways to the State.
Billy was also dedicated to improving
public education in Mississippi and giv-
ing every child a chance for success.
His influence on the lives of numerous
Mississippians will not be forgotten,
but his honorable demeanor and com-
mitment will be greatly missed.
I just think back to being at Jacinto,
an ancient courthouse that predates
the Civil War in Mississippi near
Rienzi, where Speaker McCoy was
from. Whether you are a Republican or
a Democrat, when you got ready to
run, you had better go pay homage to
the great Speaker Billy McCoy, who
did so much for Mississippi.
And I can still see him sitting on the
front lawn in front of the trailer with
the hay bales on it, where I would
speak for my first political speech, and
seeing Speaker McCoy out there, know-
ing that I would have gone by and got-
ten advice from him, even though we
were on opposite political parties.
May Mr. Speaker rest in peace.
RECOGNIZING JUDGE SADIE HOLLAND
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize
Judge Sadie Holland, another icon in
history. And thank goodness she is still
here with us. She is just retiring.
She is retiring from Lee County Jus-
tice Court as a judge, after 16 years of
service in that capacity. She also has a
history of being Lee County’s first fe-
male justice court judge. She served,
before that, as the Tupelo court admin-
istrator and mayor of Nettleton, a
small community in Lee County.
Judge Holland’s influence in the com-
munity has been so significant, Lee
County proclaimed November 3 as
Sadie Holland Day.
I also have to mention that one of
her sons is retiring as a State rep-
resentative of over 36 years, who I will
recognize next, and her other is a su-
pervisor in her home county of Lee
County.
The Hollands are icons in Lee Coun-
ty, and I thank Judge Sadie Holland
for her service.
RECOGNIZING STATE REPRESENTATIVE STEVE
HOLLAND
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, today I rise to recognize soon-
to-be former—he is about to retire
from the Mississippi House of Rep-
resentatives—Representative Steve
Holland.
Steve has served in the House of Rep-
resentatives in the Mississippi legisla-
ture for 36 years. He was also a desk
mate, I think, of former Speaker
McCoy, and they were good friends.
Steve has represented the 16th Dis-
trict of Mississippi proudly, as he has
represented all of the people of his dis-
trict. He is a true Mississippian who
prioritized legislation that would cre-
ate a brighter future for Mississippi.
And, if you have never met Steve
Holland, he is a character who is not
large enough for this body to contain.
What a gentleman. Always for the
State of Mississippi and a true Mis-
sissippian at heart, but always with a
quip and quick humor. He was always
willing to never take himself too seri-
ously, although all the matters that he
achieved were very serious.
Steve Holland is an icon in Mis-
sissippi politics. I look forward to
working with Steve in his retirement
and thank him for his service.
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I just want to talk a little bit
about this impeachment process, or
whatever you want to call it that we
have going on.
The American people deserve the
facts—and just the facts—not suppo-
sition from witnesses who have second-
and third- and fourth- and fifth-hand
information.
They have a right to not have law-
yers and alleged whistleblowers, who
the lawyer has—the coup started in
2017 as soon as our President took of-
fice, or impeachment next.
Mr. Speaker, the people of America
deserve the facts. They don’t deserve
secret proceedings, leaks, misinforma-
tion, and disinformation.
And I just want to make a small
point. A whistleblower is not afforded
anonymity by the statute. They are af-
forded the protection from firing or re-
taliation, not anonymity. It is not a
hotline or an anonymous tip line.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the misin-
formation and disinformation stop.
Just the facts.
f
RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUG
COSTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, last
Friday, November 8, the Department of
Health and Human Services announced
that the new Medicare part B pre-
miums starting in January 2020 will in-
crease by $9.10 a month, a 6.7 percent
increase over last year.
In dollars and cents, this means that
premiums will go to $144.60 a month, up
from $135 a month. As seniors know all
too well, that $144 will be deducted
automatically from their Social Secu-
rity checks, which is a bitter pill given
the fact that Social Security itself is
slated only to rise by 1.6 percent start-
ing January 1.
Very simply, that $9-a-month in-
crease for millions of seniors will chew
up a large part of any COLA that they
can possibly receive starting in Janu-
ary.
So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to
footstop that point about the fact that
the Social Security system’s COLA,
which is tied to general inflation in the
economy, is going up 1.6 percent;
whereas, the Medicare part B premium,
which is tied to healthcare costs, is
going up 6.7 percent.
This is something that we know is
endemic throughout the healthcare
system. In the State of Connecticut,
the Department of Insurance increased
commercial insurance rates, that went
up again above inflation, and identified
the fact that prescription drug cost
was the primary cost driver.
The Center for Medicare Services last
Friday, when they announced the
Medicare part B premiums, also con-
firmed the fact that it is prescription
drug costs that are driving that 6.7 per-
cent increase.
The increase in prescription drug
costs that Medicare paid from 2018 to
2019 was 10 percent, and they are pro-
jecting that it is going to go to 10.10
percent in 2020; thus, we have a $9 in-
crease coming up in terms of people’s
premiums.
This is not going to come as a great
surprise to the American people. If you
go back to last year’s election in 2018,
the exit polls showed that the number
one issue that people cared about and
were concerned about and wanted Con-
gress to act on was healthcare costs—
more specifically, prescription drug
costs.
That was an election that had the
largest voter turnout since 1914 in a
midterm election and elected a new
majority with a 10-million-vote plu-
rality.
So, that is the context that we are in
right now, at a moment where this
Congress, and particularly the House of
Representatives, is poised to take up
H.R. 3, which is the Lower Drug Costs
Now Act. And in the midst of all the
media focus on impeachment, it is im-
portant to know that the committees
that have cognizance over healthcare—
the Ways and Means Committee, the
Energy and Commerce Committee, and
the Education and Labor Committee,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8832 November 14, 2019
on which I sit—reported out basically
the same version of H.R. 3.
And it is, again, a matter of just a
couple of weeks for the Congressional
Budget Office to finish scoring the bill
that we are going to take up that
measure for a vote.
What does it do? It basically
unhandcuffs the Department of Health
and Human Services to negotiate with
the pharmaceutical companies. By law,
they have been prohibited, with what is
called the noninterference clause, from
negotiating lower drug prices.
The VA system has been negotiating
prescription drug costs for decades,
and, in fact, they get a much better
price for veterans in America than the
folks who, again, are covered by Medi-
care.
So that noninterference clause is
going to be scaled back. DHS is going
to be able to negotiate the 250 highest
brand-name drug costs tied to an inter-
national price index—because America
pays the highest drug costs by far. The
next highest country is Switzerland,
and they pay 25 percent less than we do
here in the U.S.
Again, what do those savings mean in
terms of folks on Medicare? Already
CBO has told us, for people on part D,
which is the outpatient prescription
drug benefit, they, again, will see a re-
duction in the out-of-pocket costs,
which today are unlimited in terms of
any copayments that they are paying
for medications. That will be capped at
$2,000.
I have a constituent up in Killingly,
Connecticut; she is a retired teacher.
She has AFib. She is on Medicare part
D. It has been a great help to her. But
those copayments, because the AFib
medication is so expensive, cost her
$13,000 a year.
That will be brought down to $2,000 a
year if we pass H.R. 3, and that is just
one example of the benefits—$350 bil-
lion in savings to Medicare over 10
years, according to the Congressional
Budget Office.
Again, this is a program, Medicare,
which is slated to go into negative ter-
ritory, according to the trustee, start-
ing in 2026. We are giving a $350 billion
lifeline to Medicare to make sure that
it is an enduring program moving for-
ward in the future.
That is why organizations like
AARP, the National Committee to Pre-
serve Social Security and Medicare,
NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social
Justice, Patients for Affordable Drugs
Now, and the Small Business Majority
are supporting H.R. 3.
It is time to sit up and pay attention
to what just happened last week to
Medicare and pass H.R. 3 for America’s
patients and seniors.
f
HONORING MASTER SERGEANT
MATTHEW WILLIAMS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. ROY) for 5 minutes.
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to
honor a native of the 21st Congres-
sional District of Texas, Master Ser-
geant Matthew Williams.
Master Sergeant Williams received
the Medal of Honor at the White House
2 weeks ago for his heroic actions while
serving as Weapons Sergeant, Special
Forces Operational Detachment Alpha
3336, Special Operations Task Force-33,
in support of Operation Enduring Free-
dom.
According to the Medal of Honor ci-
tation, on April 6, 2018, Williams, his
team, and roughly 100 Afghan com-
mandos were airdropped from heli-
copters into a mountainous area in Af-
ghanistan’s Shok Valley.
The terrain was too rough for the
helicopters to land, so the soldiers
jumped from 10 to 12 feet off the back
of the helicopters to start the mission.
Some landed on jagged rocks. Others
landed waist-deep in a river. None of
them were detoured from the mission.
After making their way through fast-
moving water and up rocky terrain, an
element of Williams’ team faced an on-
slaught of machine gun fire, sniper fire,
and rocket-propelled grenades.
Williams and his group were forced to
take cover. Once Williams learned
members of his team were trapped and
taking heavy fire, he quickly joined a
small assault team to assist the
wounded and the troops taking heavy
fire.
Williams led the group up the moun-
tain and across a 100-meter valley of
boulders and difficult terrain toward
the American troops in danger.
b 1030
Quickly, they set up a human chain
to bring the wounded down the moun-
tain. As they were setting up the chain,
one of his fellow soldiers was hit. With-
out a moment’s hesitation, Williams
braved enemy fire to give the soldier
first aid and get him out of the line of
fire.
After helping his fellow soldier, Wil-
liams immediately turned around and
fought his way back up to the moun-
tain to where his teammates were
pinned down.
After taking out multiple insurgents,
Williams worked to get his unit orga-
nized. He then went back to putting
himself between enemy fire and his fel-
low soldiers, to protect them as they
were making their way to safety.
Insurgents began attacking a small
house at the base of the mountain the
American troops were using as the col-
lection point for casualties and injured
soldiers. To buy time for helicopters to
extract the wounded and get them to
safety, Williams led a counterattack
against a group of over 200 insurgents,
fighting them off as his troops were
being saved.
Master Sergeant Williams’ actions
were critical in helping to save the
lives of four wounded soldiers. There is
no doubt that Williams protected his
fellow soldiers from grave danger. Be-
cause of his actions and that of his
brave teammates, no American service-
members were killed.
Master Sergeant Williams exempli-
fies the selfless commitment our men
and women in uniform give to the
United States of America, our values,
and our way of life.
Master Sergeant Williams from
Texas-21, from Boerne, Texas, the
State of Texas and the entire Nation is
proud of the honor you received 2
weeks ago.
HONORING SERVICE OF RICK PERRY
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I also want to
say a few remarks quickly about my
friend and former boss, and the former
Governor of the State of Texas, Rick
Perry. He is going to be ending his
service as the Secretary of Energy, I
believe at the end of this month.
He is a patriot, a proud veteran of
the Air Force, and a proud Aggie,
which he and my Aggie wife like to re-
mind me of regularly.
He was born in Paint Creek, Texas, in
a house that didn’t have indoor plumb-
ing. He lived in that house for 5 years
without indoor plumbing.
He worked up to graduate from A&M,
serve in the Air Force, serve as a State
representative, as the Texas Agri-
culture Commissioner, the Lieutenant
Governor, and the 14-year Governor of
the State of Texas.
He is my friend. I respect him im-
mensely. I thank him for his service as
the Secretary of Energy.
I would just say that when I worked
for him, I was battling Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, and the Governor could not
have been more gracious and more sup-
portive of me and my young family at
the time.
He will always be someone for whom
I will be happy to crawl across broken
glass for any day, any week, anywhere
in the United States. I know his public
service is far from over because he
loves this country so much.
QUESTIONS FOR MAJORITY LEADER
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I would make
only one other point in my remaining
20 seconds.
I heard the distinguished majority
leader talking about the whistleblower.
We are in the middle of the Nation fo-
cusing on what the House of Represent-
atives is doing, and the Nation is won-
dering why we aren’t working on the
things that will make their lives bet-
ter: lowering healthcare prices, bal-
ancing the budget, securing the border,
and doing the work that we should be
doing to make their lives better in the
United States of America.
To listen to the majority leader talk-
ing about the whistleblower in some
hallowed respect when that very whis-
tleblower had an attorney who was
talking about a coup in 2017, I would
ask one question: Why hasn’t this al-
leged whistleblower fired that attor-
ney?
Did the whistleblower know that the
attorney was talking about a coup in
2017? If he did, why did he hire him? If
he didn’t, why hasn’t he fired him?
Those would be my questions for the
distinguished majority leader.

November 14, 2019
RECOGNIZING GLOBAL COALITION
TO DEFEAT ISIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) for 5 minutes.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to speak about a bipartisan reso-
lution I am introducing today, to-
gether with a group of Democrats and
Republicans, recognizing the global co-
alition to defeat ISIS.
This resolution recognizes the crit-
ical contributions of the counter-ISIS
coalition partners; the value of those
partnerships to countering threats,
both today and tomorrow; and the im-
portance of building and maintaining
trust among partners for the sake of
future fights—as well as reaffirming
Congress’ commitment to defeating
ISIS.
It is important to remember how this
coalition of 60-plus countries came to-
gether in the first place. Take yourself
back 5 years. ISIS had taken over wide
swaths of Iraq and Syria. They had
huge amounts of territory. They were
systematically slaughtering the oppo-
sition. They were targeting ethnic
groups. They were targeting Chris-
tians. They were targeting Yazidis.
They were systematically raping
women. They were setting up bureau-
cratic structures, charging taxes, and
extorting people.
They were projecting violence and
threats out of that territory into
places like Europe, into places like
Russia, and into places like the United
States. So the Department of Defense
and the Department of State pieced to-
gether 60 nations to contribute to a co-
alition.
Some of those countries provide F–16
air cover. Some provide overhead im-
agery. Some provide human intel-
ligence. Some train the Iraqi security
forces and police. Everyone has a part
to play.
Today, as I speak, Secretary Pompeo
is convening the counter-ISIS coalition
at the highest levels in an emergency
session to discuss the future of the
counter-ISIS mission, following Presi-
dent Trump’s decision to pull out U.S.
forces from northern Syria.
Our allies and partners are rightfully
questioning the future of this coali-
tion. The President surprised these na-
tions, all 60 of them, with the pullout.
Many of our partners found out about
the pullout, in which they are involved,
via tweet and via the media.
As the counter-ISIS coalition part-
ners come to Washington, I, therefore,
want to take a moment to recognize
their partnership, their contributions,
and their commitment to the counter-
ISIS fight.
Why is it important to have a coali-
tion? Why is it important that 60 na-
tions come together to fight this ter-
rorist group? It is not just for show.
For every airman, marine, soldier, or
sailor from the U.K., Spain, France, or
Norway who comes to contribute to the
fight, that is one fewer soldier, airman,
marine, or naval officer who needs to
come from the United States. For
every piece of intelligence that they
risk their lives to collect, that is one
fewer piece that we need to collect and
risk our lives for.
Most importantly, working in coali-
tion keeps the American homeland
safer than it would be simply if it were
up to us to defend. In an era of
globalized threats that can come from
anywhere, we need a global coalition
before the threats land on our shores.
As we know in Michigan, our hand-
shake is our bond; our word is our rep-
utation; and we are stronger together
than we are apart.
I am, therefore, proud to be intro-
ducing this resolution, together with a
bipartisan group, as a signal of our ap-
preciation and our word and as a sign
of our commitment to our counter-ISIS
partners today and into the future.

HONORING SERVICE OF DR.
DWIGHT VINES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, the
people of Louisiana lost a great man
when former University of Louisiana at
Monroe President Dwight Vines passed
away at the age of 88.
Dr. Vines was born in Jackson Parish
in 1931. After earning his doctorate de-
gree in business administration, he be-
came a professor at Northeast Lou-
isiana University, which would later
become ULM.
Under his leadership as president,
from 1976 to 1991, ULM developed 40
new degree programs and built a school
of nursing, an aquatic center, and a
sports stadium, and it expanded its li-
brary.
In addition to his time at ULM, Dr.
Vines served as economic development
officer for the city of Monroe and dis-
trict director for former Fifth District
Congressman Dr. John Cooksey.
Please join me in honoring a great
Louisianan, Dr. Dwight Vines.
f
SUPPORT LONG-TERM FUNDING
FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CEN-
TERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. GOMEZ) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, we are just
days away from another funding cliff
for our community health centers.
This is unacceptable. Our Nation’s
community health centers need stable,
long-term funding to serve the most
vulnerable patients in our communities
effectively.
Community health centers are a
bright spot in our Nation’s healthcare
system. Last year, they served 29 mil-
lion patients across the country, in-
cluding 693,000 who visited 74 different
sites in my district alone. Community
health centers like Clinica Romero in
Boyle Heights provide care to immi-
grants, low-income individuals, com-
munities of color, and the homeless.
For many Americans, community
health centers are the first and only
place they turn when they need to see
a medical professional. Making sure
that these Americans receive the care
they need is good for our healthcare
system, for our economy, and for work-
ing families in all of our communities.
We have long had bipartisan support
on community health centers, but our
failure to provide long-term funding
hurts their ability to budget and plan.
It creates uncertainty and has an im-
pact on the patients they serve, includ-
ing hundreds of thousands of my con-
stituents.
With them in mind, I urge my col-
leagues to join me to support stable,
long-term funding for our Nation’s
community health centers.
f
APPRECIATION FOR FSA MARKET
FACILITATION PAYMENTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, last
week, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue
announced another round of market fa-
cilitation payments to help farmers
and ranchers deal with the continued
impacts of ongoing trade disruptions.
President Trump is delivering on his
promise to help agriculture producers
while he works to open new markets
and deliver free, fair, and reciprocal
trade agreements for farmers and
ranchers. While these payments serve
only as a short-term solution, a Band-
Aid, President Trump and USTR con-
tinue to fight, both day and night, to
secure a deal with China.
I also want to give a special shout-
out and thanks to Farm Service Agen-
cy State Executive Director for Kansas
David Schemm, my good friend. David
and the men and women of Kansas’ 105
FSA county offices work tirelessly to
process tens of thousands of MFP ap-
plications for Kansas farmers.
Thank you, David, and your team, for
all you do for Kansas agriculture.
IMPEACHMENT EVIDENCE SHOWS NO HIGH CRIME
OR MISDEMEANOR
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this
week, House Democrats began the pub-
lic hearing phase of their partisan im-
peachment sham, which continues in a
completely unfair, unjust, and unprece-
dented manner.
There are at least four indisputable
pieces of evidence showing no high
crime or misdemeanor committed by
the President.
Number one, the July 25 call sum-
mary, the best evidence of the con-
versation, shows no evidence of pres-
sure or conditions.
Number two, President Zelensky and
President Trump have both said there
was no pressure on the call.
Number three, the Ukrainian Govern-
ment was not aware of a hold on U.S.
assistance at the time of the July 25
call.

Number four, President Trump met
with President Zelensky, and the U.S.
assistance flowed to Ukraine in Sep-
tember 2019, without Ukraine inves-
tigating President Trump’s concern for
corruption.
Mr. Speaker, there is no objective
evidence to undo the votes of 63 million
Americans.
Not only do the Democrats and their
leadership ignore the facts in order to
impeach President Trump, but they are
also ignoring the American people by
failing to get anything done.
Republicans stand at the ready to
pass USMCA, secure our border, and
create a bipartisan plan to lower pre-
scription drug costs. Sadly, Democrats
intend to deny the American people
such progress.
COMMEMORATING SERVICE DURING MILITARY
WEEK
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, in
honor of Veterans Day, this week is
Military Week for our office. This
week, we will honor the sacrifices of
those who have and are currently serv-
ing in America’s armed forces.
This year, our office took part in the
2019 Veteran History Project to give
our Nation’s heroes a platform to tell
their stories. This project will allow fu-
ture generations to hear directly from
veterans to better understand their re-
alities, the personal sacrifices of war,
and the importance of public service.
For this project, our office inter-
viewed three constituents from the Big
First District about their military
service. All three gentlemen not only
served their country overseas but re-
turned home to make lasting impacts
on their communities and create a bet-
ter Kansas for all of us.
Listening to these veterans’ stories
of sacrifice and bravery is quite inspir-
ing. Thank you to each of these fine
gentlemen for your service, for your
families’ sacrifices, and for sharing
your stories for future generations.
FIGHTING NORTHWEST KANSAS WILDFIRES
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this
past Saturday, a disaster declaration
was issued for Cheyenne County in
northwest Kansas after a series of
grass fires broke out between St.
Francis and Wheeler.
Thanks to fast-acting volunteers and
the National Guard, many homes,
farms, and, most importantly, families
were kept safe. Even pheasant hunters
out on opening day pitched in to help
fight the fires.
Time and time again, rural Kansans
rise to the occasion and the challenges
to provide for their communities’ needs
without a moment’s notice. That is
what Kansans do. These are Kansas
values.
Thank you to all the first responders,
the troops, and the citizen volunteers
who bravely responded to put out these
fires in Cheyenne County. Thank you
for helping take care of your neighbors.

HIGHLIGHTING IMPROVEMENTS TO VA
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, in
honor of Military Week in my office, I
would like to take a moment to high-
light improvements made to our VA
healthcare system by the VA MISSION
Act. This week, our office partnered
with Newman Regional Health Center
in Emporia to host a community forum
to share information about healthcare
options available to veterans through
the VA MISSION Act, which went into
effect June 6.
Since being implemented, the VA
MISSION Act has benefited thousands
of veterans in Kansas greatly, allowing
them the option to get care at home. In
rural Kansas, it can be costly and bur-
densome for many veterans to travel to
a nearby VA facility which might be as
many as 2 to 3 hours away. The MIS-
SION Act enables them to seek the
care they want from a provider closer
to home.
We must continue to empower our
veterans, providing them with the
choice they need to receive the care
they deserve, the care we promised
them all. Thanks to Congress and the
work of the Trump administration, we
are taking steps to provide our vet-
erans the very best of care because
they deserve nothing less.
f
AMERICANS WHO HAVE VOLUN-
TARILY SERVED AND SAC-
RIFICED DESERVE OUR DEEPEST
GRATITUDE AND RECOGNITION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Colorado (Mr. CROW) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in support of the Global War on Ter-
rorism Memorial Location Act, which I
am very proud to have introduced
along with my friend and colleague
from Wisconsin, Congressman MIKE
GALLAGHER.
The global war on terrorism changed
the course of American history and the
lives of millions of servicemembers,
first responders, and civil servants—in-
cluding my own.
On 9/11 and since, we have learned
that we can never take our democracy
or our country’s security for granted.
It is a fight that, sadly, continues
today.
The millions of Americans who have
voluntarily served and sacrificed for
our Nation deserve our deepest grati-
tude, but they also deserve our recogni-
tion.
Several generations of Americans
have now come of age during the global
war on terrorism. There are now Amer-
icans born after 9/11 who are serving
today, overseas, in uniform in what has
become our Nation’s longest conflict.
That is one of the reasons why it is
now time for us to recognize the sev-
eral generations of Americans who
have volunteered to serve our Nation:
those of us who have served and who
have worked to help our fellow vet-
erans understand the important power
of place, the transformational power of
a sacred location where veterans and
their families can come together to
heal, to remember, and to reflect.
Memorials like those for World War
II, Korea, and Vietnam have provided
the opportunities for those generations
whose lives and service were defined by
those conflicts, and it is now time for
the current generation of veterans to
have that same opportunity. It is our
hope that, by honoring them in the Na-
tion’s Capital, we will ensure a loca-
tion befitting of their service and their
sacrifice.
Over 21⁄2 million Americans have
served in uniform in the global war on
terrorism, and millions more first re-
sponders, law enforcement, and civil
servants have also supported global op-
erations. To date, over 7,000 Americans
have given the ultimate sacrifice and
over 53,000 have been wounded. Many
more bear the invisible scars of the war
that will be with them for the rest of
their lives.
If these feel like statistics to some,
they are not to me and to many others.
At a time when Congress feels more di-
vided than ever before, I hope that this
Congress can focus on what we do have
in common and what does bring us to-
gether so that we can move our coun-
try forward.
We have a sacred duty to those who
have selflessly served in our Nation’s
longest war, and it is a charge that we
do not take lightly. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in this effort by sup-
porting the bill.

WELCOMING MR. DIPESH PANDYA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without

There was no objection.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize our guest chap-
lain for today, Dipesh Pandya, along
with members of the BAPS mandirs in
our district in Pennsylvania.
They are here with hundreds of
prominent Indian Americans who are
also members of the BAPS organiza-
tion, a Hindu faith that holds services
in 32 States across 91 congressional dis-
tricts.
They are here with us today to cele-
brate Diwali, the festival of lights, a
festival celebrated by over 2 million In-
dian Americans across the United
States. This 5-day celebration signifies
the triumph of light over darkness,
knowledge over ignorance, and hope
over despair.
Diwali reminds us that there is joy in
serving God, serving our country, serv-
ing our community, and our fellow citi-
zens, particularly during times of ca-
lamity and despair. Traditionally, rows
of divas, or candles, were used to illu-
minate and dispel darkness.
Today we are reminded that we must
work together, united and in friend-
ship, to serve this great Nation and the
communities in which we live.
Indeed, the BAPS community
throughout the United States continu-
ously strives to serve society through
various charitable and humanitarian
activities, ranging from food drives to
disaster relief efforts, including the
planting of trees.
On behalf of my fellow Members of
Congress, I am proud to recognize and
welcome the BAPS members who have
traveled here to Washington from

SUPPORTING THE FARM
WORKFORCE MODERNIZATION ACT
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of the nearly 5,000
farmers in my district, 96 percent of
which are family-owned farms.
Every time I am home, I meet with
farmers about the major challenges
they face today. The need to modernize
and make more effective our H2A visa
program is consistently flagged.
That is why I am proud to support
the bipartisan Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act, a historic bill that both
simplifies and broadens the scope of
the H2A application process. In addi-
tion to ensuring critical protections for
work, the bill will finally allow dairy
and other farm operations to access the
H2A farm worker program, a critical
priority for farmers in New York-19.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of upstate
produce and vegetable growers, dairy
operators, and all farmers in my dis-
trict, I applaud the bipartisan work of
my colleagues in negotiating this im-
portant agreement. Now let’s come to-
gether and get this done.
f
IMPEACHMENT HOAX
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, after over a month of secret
investigations against the President,
Democrats have now decided to open
these controlled hearings to the public.
This continued deception by Demo-
crats to mislead the American people
is insulting. No Republican witnesses,
no counsel of the President to partici-
pate, and full exoneration by the cou-
rageous President Zelensky of Ukraine.
It is said that, instead of focusing on
funding our military through the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act or
passing the United-States-Mexico-Can-
ada Agreement to create jobs, which
improves our schools, like Lexington
District 1, Democrats continue.
They have wasted $30 million of tax-
payer money on the Russian hoax and
are now proceeding with the Ukrainian
hoax. This partisan witch hunt diverts
attention from the President’s suc-
cesses.
The unemployment rate is at a
record low; there is record job creation;
and the stock market is thriving,
showing President Trump keeps his
promises.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
Thank you, President Lech Walesa of
Poland, a world hero, for testifying
yesterday for freedom.
f
LOWER DRUG PRICES NOW
(Mr. CRIST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of lower drug prices, because
Americans are getting squeezed while
drug companies are raking in the cash.
One of my constituents, Mike
McKenny, runs a minority-owned,
small business in St. Petersburg. He
works hard for a living, making pay-
roll, serving his customers.
When Mike’s daughter Taylor was di-
agnosed with diabetes, he had to pull
thousands out of the family’s 401(k)
and do, in his words, ‘‘other creative
things’’ to make ends meet when the
insurance coverage ran out. At the
toughest point, he paid $120 for a 3-day
supply of the insulin to keep his daugh-
ter alive.
Mr. Speaker, $120 for 3 days. That is
immoral.
Under the Elijah Cummings Lower
Drug Costs Now Act, nearly 600,000 of
my constituents will pay less for drugs,
some dramatically so.
End the drug company abuse. Lower
drug prices now.

WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, this week
the Supreme Court heard oral argu-
ments surrounding DACA. Now 800,000
lives hang in the balance.
Mr. Speaker, 800,000 is a big number,
and in the face of abstract figures it is
easy to lose touch with the human re-
ality.
So let’s think of, maybe, just one
person, one young woman who has
lived virtually her entire life in this
country; whose friends, family, and
community are here; who attends
school and plays on the soccer team
and volunteers at a food bank; who
speaks English and no other language.
Which one of us would take that
child to the border and send her across
alone?
Which one of us would banish her to
a place she has never been?
Which one of us would force her to
build a life and a language she does not
even know?
Which one of us could abandon that
child with a clear conscience?
I suspect the answer is very few of us.
And, if that is right, if in our hearts we
would not permit us to behave with
such coldness and cruelty, then we can-
not allow our government to do so ei-
ther.
As our dear colleague Mr. Cummings
said, we are better than this.

ticeship Week.
I am proud the Trump administra-
tion has, once again, placed an empha-
sis on these crucial skills development
and employee advancement programs.
The Department of Labor has contin-
ually recognized the importance of ap-
prenticeships to the future of work in
our Nation and, for the fifth year in a
row, dedicated a week to highlighting
the need for expanded access to these
educational and career opportunities.
It is essential we increase awareness
of the benefits of these crucial pro-
grams which link our education system
with our workforce development initia-
tives.
As I travel throughout Kentucky’s
First Congressional District, I hear
from employers of all sizes and indus-
tries that say they are unsatisfied with
recent graduates’ credentials and they
are lacking workers with the skills
necessary to perform the duties of
their job.
As a new member to the Committee
on Education and Labor this Congress,
I am proud of the bipartisan pieces of
legislation we have advanced and look
forward to future opportunities to sup-
port employers, provide skills develop-
ment for those already employed, and
enhance the jobs and generations of the
future.

BRING DOWN PRESCRIPTION DRUG
PRICES
(Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today with a call to action to bring
down prescription drug prices.
Some say a drug company should be
able to charge any price because that is
just how the market works. But the
market for many prescription drugs is
broken.
As a diabetic, I know how the price of
insulin has skyrocketed for no good
reason. Medicare spent 31⁄2 times more
on insulin per patient in 2016 than in
2007.
Many Americans depend on other
drugs to survive: EpiPens for life-
threatening allergies, emergency inhal-
ers for asthma, chemotherapy drugs for
cancer. Patients relying on life-sus-
taining drugs can’t simply vote with
their wallet to fight back against price
gougers.
That is why I introduced H.R. 5039, to
give Medicare the tools it needs to
bring down the price of life-sustaining
drugs, similar to other developed coun-
tries.
American families deserve better
than the Big Pharma status quo. Let’s
pass H.R. 5039 and give that to them.
f
CALLING FOR CAUTION ON
IMPEACHMENT
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight
the unfortunate position this institu-
tion has been placed in over the past
several weeks. Long before Speaker
PELOSI launched this impeachment in-
quiry, many of my colleagues had al-
ready made it clear that their number
one priority was impeaching the Presi-
dent.
Congress should rightfully use its
oversight powers to ensure laws are ex-
ecuted faithfully, but this exercise has
shown itself to be the ultimate manip-
ulation of the legislative branch’s over-
sight to achieve political gains.
I caution my colleagues from placing
political expediency ahead of modera-
tion. A vote for impeachment will for-
ever change this institution. Imagine a
future where this body utilizes the
most severe of its constitutional tools
to continually put the minority party
on trial.
Mr. Speaker, the American people
have elected their representatives to be
their voice and vote on matters most
important to this country. We must
collectively focus on these issues, not
the political impulses of a few.
For the sake of this institution, and
for the good of the Nation, this cannot
become the new normal.
f
THANKING VETERANS FOR
SERVICE
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I re-
cently spent time visiting schools
throughout the Virgin Islands.
While it is always exciting to spend
time with our young people, it was sad
to see that the school libraries across
the territory are in dire need of books
and librarians to provide students and
teachers with educational resources,
including territory-specific material
that will enlighten our young people
about their rich heritage. We all have
to do better.
My office also hosted two townhalls
with officials from the VA and the U.S.
Postal Service to discuss issues facing
our veterans and the community at
large. Within the next few months, it is
my hope that both the Postal Service
and the VA will make measurable
progress.
I thank members of my community
for coming out, particularly our vet-
erans, because, on Monday, we com-
memorated Veterans Day, paying trib-
ute to men and women who have served
in the U.S. Armed Forces.
Elmer Davis once said it ‘‘will re-
main the land of the free only for so
long as it is the home of the brave.’’
I am proud that the Virgin Islands
has one of the highest rates of military
service in our country, including my
father.
I thank every veteran across the Na-
tion for your service to America and to
freedom.

November 14, 2019
CONGRATULATING GREATER SUS-
QUEHANNA VALLEY CHAMBER
OF COMMERCE
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, on behalf
of the people of Pennsylvania’s 12th
Congressional District, congratulations
to the Greater Susquehanna Valley
Chamber of Commerce on being named
the Chamber of the Year by the Penn-
sylvania Association of Chamber Pro-
fessionals.
Located in Shamokin Dam, the
Greater Susquehanna Valley Chamber
has been in operation for 99 years and
is a conglomeration of other local
chambers, some of which are older than
the main organization. It was named
Chamber of the Year based upon its or-
ganizational strengths, including pro-
grams that encourage networking and
a chamber ambassador program.
The chamber’s most recent success is
in attracting Luzerne County Commu-
nity College to open a branch campus
in Watsontown, Pennsylvania. Cham-
ber officials credit its success to the
work of its members and staff working
together to achieve positive economic
outcomes for the people of the Greater
Susquehanna Valley.
Again, congratulations to the Great-
er Susquehanna Valley Chamber of
Commerce and to president and CEO
Bob Garrett on receiving the Chamber
of the Year award.
f
SUPPORT DACA AND JUVENILE
JUSTICE SYSTEM REFORM
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let
me speak to a young man in my office
who is studying at St. Edwards College
in Austin, Texas. He is a person who is
able to fulfill his dreams because of
DACA.
Yesterday, the Supreme Court heard
the case about all of these young peo-
ple, 800,000 who are working as para-
medics, in medical school, in law
school, going into rural communities
and being servants of the people, some
wanting to go into the United States
military. Here is a program that was
working well, and this administration
imploded it because of wrongheaded de-
cisions about immigrants.
This is a nation of laws and of immi-
grants. We want to comply with the
law. That is what DACA was allowing
these young people to do.
We need to restore DACA, work to-
gether so that young people all over,
no matter what walk of life they come
from, can have opportunity.
At the same time, I am looking to re-
form the juvenile justice system. Most
people don’t know that when you go
into a juvenile detention center, there
is no sentence, and there is no bail. The
bail process is complicated.
We are looking to provide what we
call an omnibus bill to deal with how
we treat juveniles to ensure that we
don’t throw away lives; that if you
have a mistake at the age of 12 or 14,
your life is in front of you; and that we
help parents with wraparound services.
What I hear most of all is a parent
saying: ‘‘Help me. I don’t know where
to go. I don’t have the resources.’’
A nation as great as America can in-
vest in her children, whether it is the
DACA status of our young children at-
tempting to be part of this Nation or
whether or not, in fact, it is those
young people who made a slight wrong
turn and are thrown away for years in
detention centers that are like jails.
We are a nation that can do better.
And, yes, God bless our veterans.
f
RECOGNIZING CITIES FOR TREE
CITY USA DESIGNATION
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, today, I
rise to recognize eight cities in Texas’
Third Congressional District that have
received this year’s Tree City USA des-
ignation by the Arbor Day Foundation.
Allen, Fairview, Frisco, McKinney,
Murphy, Plano, Prosper, and Wylie, all
located in Collin County, have proven
they care about ensuring the environ-
ment around them is thriving and full
of life.
These Collin County cities under-
stand that trees serve an integral pur-
pose in our community, including im-
proved health, clean air and water, and
a positive impact on business and
homes in the area. Not only are these
communities dedicated to providing
necessary municipal tree care, but they
are encouraging their residents to do
the same.
I commend these cities for their in-
vestments in green infrastructure and
for creating a lasting, positive impact
for generations to come.
I ask my colleagues in the House of
Representatives to join me in con-
gratulating these eight communities
on their efforts to maintain healthy
and green environments and
neighborhoods.
f
HONORING MEMORY OF JAY
KISTLER
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the memory of a dear
friend, Jay Kistler. Jay passed away on
October 14 of this year, after a life of
heroism and bravery. He was 71 years
old.
He had been married to his wonderful
wife, Sheila, for almost 50 years, and he
was the father of Brooke, Kerri, and
Jay Kistler III.
Jay retired as a Navy captain and re-
tired as the government lead for the
Electronic Warfare and Counter-
measures Office. Jay’s forward-looking
vision allowed him to project capabili-
ties and actions decades into the fu-
ture. He was respected by his peers, his
subordinates, and his superiors. He was
our adversary’s worst nightmare.
I will miss him as a naval flight offi-
cer, a commander, a decorated veteran,
a family man, and my mentor.
You changed everyone’s life for the
better, Jay. Fair winds and following
seas, Captain.
f
DEMOCRATS DELIVERING ON
AGENDA FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to remind our Republican col-
leagues how much work has been done
by the House Democrats.
There has been a lot of discussion
about the ongoing impeachment in-
quiry. While that work is being done,
we have been hard at work, delivering
on our agenda for the people of this
country: driving down healthcare
costs, driving down the cost of pre-
scription drugs, raising family incomes
with a real emphasis on rebuilding the
crumbling infrastructure of America,
taking on self-dealing and corruption
in Washington, and getting the govern-
ment to work for the people of this
country again.
In that effort, we have passed over
300 pieces of legislation: 10 healthcare
bills, 4 that will reduce the cost of pre-
scription drugs; raising family incomes
by raising the minimum wage for 33
million Americans and providing equal
pay for equal work; universal back-
ground checks; restoring net neu-
trality; preventing our separating out
of the Paris climate accord; a new vet-
erans tax credit; and on and on. Eighty
percent of those bills are sitting on
MITCH MCCONNELL’s desk, awaiting ac-
tion.
Maybe most importantly, we passed
H.R. 1, the biggest anticorruption bill
passed by Congress since Watergate.
Again, 80 percent of those bills are
awaiting action in the Senate.
The Senate doesn’t have to pass the
version we passed. This is a legislative
process. Bring it to the floor, amend it,
send it back, but do your job.
The American people are expecting
us to deliver on the promises that we
made to get government to work for
the people of this country again.
f
IMPEACHMENT IMPOSES
OPPORTUNITY COST
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, the im-
peachment hearings are continuing, in
spite of the following factors existing.
Number one, this is a very unfair
process. If Democratic leadership was
truly interested in determining guilt or
innocence, why not establish bipar-
tisan rules and procedures allowing the
President due process?

Number two, the leading Democratic
players have maintained predeter-
mined presumptions of guilt for well
over a year now and have repeatedly
been untruthful about contact with the
whistleblower. The whistleblower’s at-
torney even called for a Presidential
coup more than 2 years ago.
Number three, Democratic leadership
does not have any facts that constitute
an impeachable offense. There has been
no evidence whatsoever of quid pro
quo. There was no ‘‘this for that.’’
This inquiry is called a sham by
many for these reasons.
This has also been a great oppor-
tunity lost at a high opportunity cost
to our country. Because of this politi-
cally motivated impeachment pro-
ceeding, there has been no USMCA, no
illegal immigration reform, no low-
ering of prescription drug costs, no in-
frastructure bill, nothing except inves-
tigations to nowhere.
f
HONORING SACRIFICES OF OUR
NATION’S VETERANS
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in celebration of Veterans
Day, when we honor the extraordinary
sacrifices made by our Nation’s vet-
erans.
While Veterans Day has already
passed this year, Congress must con-
tinue providing veterans with the sup-
port they need following their service.
We saw significant progress in this
area in June, when President Trump
signed the bipartisan Blue Water Navy
Act into law. This bill expands Viet-
nam veterans’ access to VA benefits.
Yet, we still have much work to do.
The bipartisan Keeping Our Promises
Act would further assist Vietnam-era
servicemembers exposed to Agent Or-
ange.
May we focus the attention of this
body on what our Founders described
as the pursuit of happiness. May we
work across the aisle to provide both
former and active servicemembers with
both the support and the resources
they need.
As Theodore Roosevelt said: ‘‘A man
who is good enough to shed his blood
for his country is good enough to be
given a square deal afterwards.’’
Our democracy and freedom continue
to thrive, thanks to the sacrifices of
veterans and their families. On behalf
of the Fourth District of Arkansas,
thank you for your service.

HONORING LIFE OF COLE EASTON
GORDON
(Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to remember the life of 17-
year-old Cole Gordon, an active and be-
loved community member who trag-
ically passed away on September 22,
2019, in a car accident.
Cole was a lifelong resident of
Friendswood, Texas, and would have
been a graduate of Friendswood High
School class of 2020. He was planning
on attending Western Texas College in
Snyder, Texas, to pursue a degree in
agribusiness.
Cole was a member and 3-year officer
of the Friendswood FFA, Future Farm-
ers of America. He interned the last
two summers on the Lackey Livestock
farm and volunteered with the Light-
house Charity Team, right by the side
of his dad, Scott.
Cole had earned many ribbons, ban-
ners, and buckles showing livestock all
over Texas, and even at the World Pork
Expo in Iowa. He had great plans to
‘‘go big’’ for his senior year, raising six
pigs for stock shows all over the Na-
tion. But it is his incredible dedication
to service that will never be forgotten.
Before Cole gained his passion for
livestock, he spent most of his time
volunteering. He volunteered with the
Friendswood Fire, Police, and Emer-
gency Medical Services Departments,
along with the Rotary Club of Gal-
veston, the Galveston County Emer-
gency Response Team, and the
Friendswood Chamber of Commerce.
The Rotary Club stated that Cole
‘‘exemplified the creed of service above
self in serving 9 years of volunteerism
with the Rotary Club Galveston.’’
His service throughout his entire life
supported nearly 750 charitable events,
helping to serve approximately 500,000
people.
Mr. Speaker, Cole made a lasting im-
pact on the 14th Congressional District
of Texas. He has not and will not ever
be forgotten.
Today, we honor and we recognize
the extraordinary life and service of
Cole Easton Gordon.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, yes-
terday the Rules Committee met and
reported a rule, House Resolution 695,
providing for the consideration of H.R.
4863, the United States Export Finance
Agency Act, under a structured rule.
The rule provides 1 hour of debate
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking member on the Com-
mittee on Financial Services, makes in
order 21 amendments, and provides for
a motion to recommit. It also provides
that, upon passage of the rule, H. Res.
661 and H. Res. 693 will be hereby
adopted. Additionally, it makes the
motion to discharge H. Con. Res. 70 in
order on November 21 if offered by Rep-
resentative GABBARD, debatable for 20
minutes. Lastly, the rule extends the
positive work of the Select Committee
on the Modernization of Congress to
the conclusion of the 116th Congress.
Mr. Speaker, given that the United
States is the third largest exporter of
goods in the world, maintaining and
supporting this industry is imperative
for our economic well-being and for
good-paying jobs across the country. In
2018, we shipped over $2.5 trillion worth
of commercial aircraft, machinery, in-
dustrial supplies, consumer goods, and
agricultural products overseas.
The Export-Import Bank, or Ex-Im
Bank, plays a large role in supporting
that business. Through direct loans,
medium- and long-term loan guaran-
tees, working capital, and insurance,
the Ex-Im Bank steps in where private
financing is unavailable and has been
supporting American exporters for
nearly a century. Because of work like
this, in the last 10 years, Ex-Im has
created 1.7 million American jobs.
Over the last several years, we have
seen the Bank go through a lot of un-
necessary political turmoil. After suc-
cessfully reauthorizing the Bank in
2015, the Senate has failed to confirm
board members. Under current law,
without Senate action, the Bank was
left almost inoperable.
The effects were felt across the Na-
tion, and in my own district, it was af-
fected there. In the past 5 years, my
district in northern California has been
home to nine exporters, of which seven
are small businesses and five are owned
by women and minorities. After Senate
negligence left the Bank unable to do
its work, today there are only three ex-
porters remaining in my district.
In today’s bill to reauthorize the
Bank, we make substantial improve-
ments that not only address the polit-
ical problems displayed in the Senate,
but also improve and diversify the
Bank’s activities. In short, the United
States Export Finance Agency Act will
help support even more jobs, with new
emphasis on small business, women-
and minority-owned businesses.
As a former small business owner, I
am encouraged by this effort. To stay
on top, the United States must stay
competitive. This bill gives us that
chance to help workers, help busi-
nesses, and help our economy.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume
and thank my friend from California
for yielding me the time.
I want to tell a different story, Mr.
Speaker. You and I haven’t gotten a
chance to work together down here
when I have really gotten to come
down here and really sell these rules,
because back when I was in the major-
ity on the Rules Committee, we didn’t
always get it right; but, as a rank-and-
file member of the committee, I always
had a chance to improve the bill, to
make it better, to try to hear some
voices.
My friend from Florida is not down
here with us today. My friend from
California knows, the worst thing
about having ALCEE HASTINGS on your
committee is that he gets all fired up
and all geared up, and you almost get
upset because so often he is right, and
he is pointing out your flaws and he is
making you do it better. We need more
of that from one another, Mr. Speaker,
where we get ourselves wound up, not
about Republicans and Democrats, but
about how to do the process better.
I know that your week and my friend
from California’s week has been just
like my week. It started out with Vet-
erans Day events back home in your
district. And you didn’t find a man or
a woman who said, ‘‘Let’s do better for
Republican veterans but not so much
for Democratic veterans,’’ or vice
versa. You found men and women who
were proud of their service. You found
men and women who wanted to support
those men and women who had served
us. You found folks grateful for our op-
portunities to be in community with
one another and do better tomorrow
than we did yesterday.
Then we showed up here on Tuesday
after Veterans Day break and we start-
ed with our suspension calendar.
For the life of me, I don’t understand
why this institution hides all the good
things that it does and accentuates all
the controversial things it does. If we
took a poll outside the Capitol today,
Mr. Speaker, I just want to ask you,
and I want to make sure I get it right:
How many folks walking past the Cap-
itol today know that, in a bipartisan
way, you and I and the gentleman from
California came together on Tuesday
and passed General Bergman’s GI Bill
Planning Act to ease the burden on
new servicemembers as they try to sort
out accessing their education benefits?
This is an important issue that has
been plaguing our veterans. We have
been talking about it here in this insti-
tution. We got together on Monday,
and we did it together. Not one head-
line, not one 6 p.m. news story. Repub-
licans and Democrats standing to-
gether in this House on behalf of vet-
erans who were not being served as
well as we knew we could serve them,
we fixed it together, but that is not
what we are talking about.
How many folks, Mr. Speaker, if we
go outside today, are going to know
that we passed Ms. BROWNLEY’s Debo-
rah Sampson Act, which recognizes the
different needs that women veterans
and newborn children have and estab-
lished a department within the VA to
make sure those needs are met?
Yes, the VA was formed as a male-
centric institution. Of course, in 2019,
there are going to be needs that were
unmet. We have known that. We have
talked about that. We have pushed that
down the road. But this House this
week came together, Republicans and
Democrats, to solve that issue once
and for all, but I challenge you to find
somebody standing outside who knows
that is what their U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives has been working on this
week.
What about Mr. CUNNINGHAM’s VA
Tele-Hearing Modernization Act? You
have the same concerns in your vet-
erans community that I do, Mr. Speak-
er: folks trying to file their appeals,
trying to get in touch with those hear-
ing boards, but because their mobility
is limited, because they are distant
from those population centers, they
can’t get that done. Mr. CUNNINGHAM’s
bill improves the ability to do that
with the telecommunications that are
available to us in 2019.
Of course, we should have gotten that
done. Of course, we should have. We
have been working on it; we have been
perfecting it. This week, this House,
Republicans and Democrats, came to-
gether and did that for veterans, too.
Mr. HARDER’s Protecting Families of
Fallen Servicemembers Act, to ensure
that family members of servicemen
and -women and Active-Duty reservists
who were killed or seriously injured on
Active Duty are allowed to terminate
their financial dealings back home in a
way that is easy.
My father passed away last summer,
Mr. Speaker. It is incredibly difficult
when you lose a family member to deal
with all of those end-of-life issues, all
of those financial issues. The last thing
our service families need to be dealing
with is sorting through all of that pa-
perwork.
We have now come together in a col-
laborative partnership way to solve
that issue. I challenge you to find a
man or woman outside the Capitol who
knows that.
Now, why do I tell you that story,
Mr. Speaker? I tell you that story be-
cause that was just Monday and Tues-
day, a little bit of Wednesday, and we
are not talking about that on the floor
of this House. Instead, I am down here
today to talk about the Ex-Im Bank

bill, which is an important bill, an im-
portant bill that we could have done in
a bipartisan way but didn’t.
I don’t know if you remember those
headlines. I brought them down here
with me, Mr. Speaker, if you don’t re-
call them. This is when we produced
the bipartisan Ex-Im Bank bill, the one
that was going to committee, the one
that Chairwoman WATERS and Ranking
Member MCHENRY worked out together
in a bipartisan way back in June: ‘‘Ex-
port-Import Bank Deal in Peril Amid
Democratic Backlash.’’
b 1245
The bipartisan bill that had been
worked out didn’t meet the standards
of some in the Democratic Caucus. The
bill got pulled back.
‘‘Democrats Defy Waters on Ex-Im
Bank Restrictions’’. Again, this is a
bill to reform the Ex-Im Bank. It im-
posed some new restrictions. The
Democratic Caucus pushed back. The
bipartisan bill was pulled.
What we have before us today, Mr.
Speaker, is a bill that is completely
partisan in its passage. The only thing
that is bipartisan about the bill today
is the folks that voted against it. Re-
publicans and Democrats said: No, this
is not the right bill. Only Democrats
said: This is the right bill.
All of these things we could be doing
in partnership, things like Ex-Im Bank
that started in partnership. It seems
we go out of our way to focus on our di-
visions instead of our successes.
So when we went to the Rules Com-
mittee in the midst of all of these great
veterans bills passing the floor of the
House, we advocated to make improve-
ments to the Ex-Im Bank bill. Again,
this was a bill that started out as a bi-
partisan bill, a collaborative bill, one
that had been sorted out between Re-
publicans and Democrats so that we
could move forward, and it turned into
a partisan bill.
We went up to the Rules Committee
to try to get some Republican amend-
ments made in order to try to improve
the bill in some way.
I know it is popular, and the lore
back home is if you are in a different
party, you don’t have anything produc-
tive to add to the debate. I hear that at
some county meetings, and I am sure
my friends on the other side of the
aisle do, too. It is just nonsense.
Having good ideas does not have a
Republican or Democratic requirement
to it. Folks on both sides of the aisle
have something to offer.
But when Republicans brought their
ideas to the Rules Committee, Mr.
Speaker, with the exception of two Re-
publican amendments, every other idea
was rejected. Every other idea was re-
jected.
Now, that is the way it went in com-
mittee, too, Mr. Speaker. If you
weren’t following the committee hear-
ings, the amendments in committee
the Republicans offered were rejected
on a party-line vote.
They had their chance in the Rules
Committee to improve upon it. Those
amendments: rejected one by one.
In fact, Mr. Speaker, and it gives me
no pleasure to say this, because my
chairman on the Rules Committee
works very hard, the last two rules I
have been down here to talk about, Re-
publicans got the same number or even
a few more amendments than Demo-
crats got. It was the first time it had
happened that I had been down here
carrying such a rule, and it did bring
some partnership back to the institu-
tion.
But for this bill, the Ex-Im Bank,
how do we finance trade in America,
not a partisan issue, we have got indi-
vidual Democratic Members who have
been offered more amendments person-
ally than the entire Republican Party
has collectively. Let me say that
again, Mr. Speaker, because this insti-
tution is divided roughly down the
middle here. I have got individual
Members of the Democratic Party who
have been offered personally more op-
portunities to change and improve this
bill than the entire Republican side of
the aisle combined. Combined. It is as
if we go out of our way to find division
in what ought to be partnership issues.
Eighty-one percent of the amend-
ments that are offered are Democratic
amendments; 17 Democratic amend-
ments made in order, two Republican
amendments, two bipartisan amend-
ments.
The funny thing about this institu-
tion, Mr. Speaker, and you see it better
from your chair than any of us do from
our chairs, is that if you are in the ma-
jority, you get to win. Two things are
important to winning. Being in the ma-
jority means you have the votes. Now
you have to bring a good idea to pair
with those votes. You can carry the
day.
We have gotten into that habit, Mr.
Speaker, of having all Republicans or
all of Democrats carry the bills one di-
rection or the other.
Where are those opportunities, like
we did on veteran bill after veteran bill
after veteran bill on Tuesday and
Wednesday of this week, to come to-
gether and do things collaboratively?
I will give you another example. I
don’t understand what the self-loath-
ing is from time to time here, Mr.
Speaker, that prevents us from cele-
brating what is the most democratic
institution in the world today.
This rule that we are talking about
today hides deep within it an extension
of the Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress. The Select
Committee on Modernization is a bi-
partisan committee, it is the only one
we have right now, Mr. Speaker, equal
number of Republicans and Democrats.
Why? Because they are not working on
partisan issues. They are trying to im-
prove the institution. They are trying
to improve the process. They are try-
ing to make this institution work bet-
ter for the American people.
It is led by two great Members of this
institution: DEREK KILMER out of
Washington State, TOM GRAVES out of
the great State of Georgia. Mr. KILMER
is a Democrat, Mr. GRAVES is a Repub-
lican. They have been leading this
committee in partnership together,
tackling thorny issue after thorny
issue in a collaborative way.
The House only authorized the com-
mittee for a year. This rule gives them
a second year. It is a great idea, it is a
great thing to do.
Because this is a rule and because it
contains all of these provisions that
completely shut out Republican con-
tributions on the Financial Services
legislation that is before us today, it is
going to pass on a party-line vote. All
the Democrats are going to vote ‘‘yes,’’
many having not read it, as is the func-
tion of rules, all Republicans are going
to vote ‘‘no.’’
We have a chance here to have taken
that language out, to have done that
together, to have talked about the suc-
cesses we have had collaboratively on
the Modernization Committee. We are
missing that chance today.
I am not enough of a failed student in
mathematics, Mr. Speaker, to believe
that I am going to prevail on the vote
on the rule today. I have done the
math again in my head. They still have
more votes than we have. I am pre-
pared to lose.
What I am not prepared to do is give
up on doing better.
I challenge my friends on both sides
of the aisle to find a partisan advan-
tage in extending the Modernization
Committee hidden inside the rule in-
stead of having that debate on the floor
of the House. You won’t find it there.
I challenge the body to find a par-
tisan advantage to spending 10 minutes
on Tuesday talking about serving vet-
erans in a bipartisan way and spending
2 hours on Thursday and Friday talk-
ing about financial services in a way
that could have been bipartisan, but in-
stead has been converted to a strictly
partisan issue, and to add insult to in-
jury, has denied all but two Republican
amendments and bipartisan voices to
the debate.
I know that habits are difficult
things to break. Some of the bad habits
that we are in in this institution start-
ed under Republican leadership, some
of the bad habits that we are in in this
institution started under Democratic
leadership.
If we want to have a day of debate on
who is to blame, I have a pretty good
idea how those lines would fall out. I
am not interested in that day of de-
bate. I am interested in a day of debate
not talking about who is to blame, but
talking about how we are working to-
gether to fix it.
Because I don’t know if your con-
stituency is anything like mine, but
my constituency is starting to think
that we have given up working to-
gether to fix it. When my constituency
turns on Fox News or MSNBC, that is
not what the talking head of the day is
talking about.
The thing that keeps me up at night,
Mr. Speaker, isn’t all the things we are
voting against, it is all the things we

miss an opportunity to vote for, those
things that, because we are here in
community together today, we have an
opportunity to fix.
I have got one for you, if you are in-
terested and if you haven’t had a
chance to take a look at it. It is the
Adoptee Citizenship Act, Mr. Speaker.
It is just crazy to me.
The best part of this job, as my
friend from California knows, is that
really smart people spend time with us
to make us smarter.
The Adoptee Citizenship Act, it is
H.R. 2731, is a bill that my Democratic
colleague, ADAM SMITH, and I have of-
fered together. When American fami-
lies adopted children from overseas in
the 1970s and 1980s, those children
didn’t automatically get citizenship.
You would think an American family
adopts a child, that child has American
parents, they are going to become an
American citizen. Not so, Mr. Speaker.
It is an incredibly long process.
Now, in the 1970s and 1980s, we didn’t
care that much about that, but fast
forward to September 11, 2001, we start-
ed talking a lot about citizenship sta-
tus, only to find out that thousands
upon thousands of Americans didn’t
have their citizenship because their
parents didn’t know they had to file all
of this additional paperwork.
Now, who among us is opposed to let-
ting American families that have been
American families for 40 years, citizens
who were adopted into American fami-
lies, get that citizenship document and
live the normal life that we all thought
they were supposed to be living here?
H.R. 2731.
The list of things that we do collabo-
ratively, cooperatively that make dif-
ferences for the American people is as
long as any statement anyone is going
to read on the floor of the House today,
and it is not going to be what we cele-
brate this week.
The last vote today is at 2 o’clock.
We are going to do amendment debate
for the rest of the day. If we don’t start
spending more time on this floor cele-
brating those things that we are doing
together, Mr. Speaker, we are going to
lose the confidence of our constituency
back home. I dare say, for many fami-
lies, they have lost confidence in us al-
ready.
I don’t shy away from the serious
fights we are going to have down here
at all. This is supposed to be a place
where serious people come together
and disagree about some ideas and sort
it all out.
What I take issue with is when we
stop trying to sort it all out and when
we send the message back home that
instead of succeeding on behalf of our
bosses, we are actually just arguing
amongst ourselves. It is not true. It is
not true.
We are missing another opportunity
today, as our ranking member said in
the Rules Committee debate last night,
to do better. I know that we have men
and women on this floor, in this insti-
tution who want to do better.
Can we fix it this afternoon? Maybe
not. Will we fix it if we stop focusing
on it? Definitely not.
My commitment to my colleagues,
for better or for worse, is that I will
spend my next 14 months focusing on it
as long as my friend from California
continues to yield me 30 minutes in the
Rules Committee debate, for which I
am grateful.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from California
(Mr. DESAULNIER) for his leadership,
and my good friend from Georgia, I
thank him for his explanation of the
process of democracy in this place.
But I am excited to announce that
this is a bipartisan effort, because the
bipartisan aspect of it are the results
of how this legislation will impact all
of America irrespective, not respect-
ing, their region, their faith, or their
party.
Let me be very clear to say what we
are actually talking about today and
the real-life stories that make a dif-
ference. It is called the Export-Import
Bank and it is legislated as the United
States Export Finance Agency, and its
short name, as I said, Export-Import.
What does that mean?
I rise to support it, because it means
something to individual businesses. It
means something to rural American
farmers. It means something to small
manufacturers.
We have been documenting that man-
ufacturing is going down, manufac-
turing based upon how you sell your
products.
This is a 10-year plan with $175 bil-
lion to help those businesses, those
small farms, those entrepreneurs in
your community. That is jobs.
What it means is the company that
makes light bulbs can now export those
to developing nations on the continent
of Africa or they can go deep into
Southeast Asia or Asia and sell prod-
ucts from the United States to a for-
eign country.
For those of us who have seen the
lopsidedness, there are governments
that actually fund businesses outside
the United States. We don’t do that,
mostly, unless it is through a grant or
through a funding for a project that we
need, and so you are on your own.
But this is going to provide small
businesses with an extra hand up. It is
going to help those who are, in par-
ticular, minority and women-owned
businesses, along with others. It is
going to create a process so that it
does not lapse.
We had a period where there was no
quorum. We couldn’t help small busi-
nesses.
I remember sitting in a room with
this company in a foreign country, a
U.S. company that was there, and they
said, ‘‘If it had not been for the Export-
Import Bank, we would have lost 300
employees in the United States.’’
b 1300
This is bipartisan. This is where we
help people, no matter who they are. I
am a strong supporter of this bill be-
cause it takes into consideration work-
ing men and women, and it takes into
consideration the environment.
All of our union friends, who provide
a pathway of success for working
Americans, support this bill because it
helps bring back manufacturing. We
support it because it gives alternative
options for energy a boost where jobs
can be created with renewable energy.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield an additional 1 minute to the
gentlewoman.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let
me just simply say that you have to
live this to understand it, and I have
spoken to those businesses that have
benefited from Export-Import.
It sounds like a name that you can’t
get your hands around, but just under-
stand it simply. You want to do busi-
ness overseas. You want to get your
products overseas. It is a big hurdle.
You need additional finance. This is
the place to come.
And they have been successful in
paying for themselves. That $175 billion
is over 10 years, but it pays for itself
with the number of businesses that
Americans can take advantage of and
create new businesses for the sole pur-
pose of selling that product overseas,
selling that small farmer produce,
what is on that small farm, allowing
them to send it to markets that are
desperate for the wonderful bounty of
food products that we are able to raise
in this wonderful country.
In particular, I would like to add, it
is a good place for veterans who want
to start their business, to add to their
business, because many of them, obvi-
ously, understand the international
realm.
Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I sup-
port this bill, the Ex-Im Bank, and I
hope that my colleagues will support
it.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself 30 seconds to say that I agree
with every good thing my friend from
Texas said that the Ex-Im Bank is able
to do, which is why, when this bill
began, it was a bipartisan bill by the
chairwoman of the committee and the
ranking Republican on the committee.
It devolved from that so that, as it
passed out of committee, it is not a bi-
partisan bill.
The only thing bipartisan about this
bill is the opposition to it. Republicans
and Democrats opposed it in com-
mittee. Only Democrats support it be-
cause of the partisan turn that it took.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.
LUCAS), the gentleman from the Finan-
cial Services Committee who tried to
make the bill better. He offered two
amendments in the Rules Committee
that would have brought bipartisan
support to this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8842 November 14, 2019
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from Georgia for yielding
me time.
Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor
today to ask my colleagues to reject
the rule that would enable a vote later
this week on reauthorizing the Export-
Import Bank.
Many of you will say: ‘‘Why, Frank,
of all people, would you come to the
floor to ask for the rejection of the rule
and the underlying bill?’’ The reason
they would ask that is because no one
has worked harder than I have, in my
career here, to make sure that this eco-
nomic tool is available to American
businesses. No one has struggled harder
than I have to make sure that those in-
dividuals who make their living in the
industries that use the Bank are able
to continue to do that. No one has
worked harder.
The last time this bill was reauthor-
ized, I sat in the majority. My leader-
ship at that time was opposed to the
reauthorization of the Export-Import
Bank. My colleague from Tennessee
and I used a procedure from the begin-
ning of the previous century to dis-
charge a clean version of the bill, to
bring it to the floor, to pass it, and, ul-
timately, for it to be passed by the
Senate and signed by the President. So
there is no one who appreciates more
than I do the importance of this bill.
So, why am I here? I had a couple of
amendments offered in the Rules Com-
mittee. I know some of my colleagues
have said: ‘‘Frank, why didn’t you offer
those amendments in the markup of
the bill?’’ Well, Mr. Speaker, I have
been around here long enough, and I
have been in this great life that we live
long enough, to understand there are
some fundamental rules.
My ranking member and my chair-
man on that committee engaged in one
of the most splendid, intense, philo-
sophical battles over reauthorizing this
bill that you will ever see. They fought
hard over every principle. They had
proponents on both sides of the com-
mittee trying to drive the bill further
to the left and, simultaneously, further
to the right. That is a difficult set of
issues to balance out.
You say: ‘‘Well, Frank, why weren’t
you engaged?’’ There is an old country
logic that goes something like this:
When your neighbor’s bull jumps into
your pasture, or when two of your bulls
get in the same pasture together and
engage in a fight and get mad and get
hot and try to fight to the death, you
don’t get between them because they
will kill you. They will kill you.
My perspective was, let the com-
mittee do its will, but on the floor of
this United States House, let’s offer al-
ternatives.
You say: ‘‘What were your amend-
ments that were rejected that would
have made a difference?’’
Amendment No. 17 simply reflected
what the White House had said: Send
us a clean 10-year reauthorization.
Clean, 10 years. Straightforward, un-
derstandable, logical.
But being the practical fellow I am, I
offered amendment No. 18. What did
No. 18 say? Basically, it was the most
popular bill in the United States Sen-
ate at this time to reauthorize the in-
stitution: a 10-year reauthorization,
raise the capitalization level to $175
billion, and address the quorum re-
quirement.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman because we are hearing from a
member of the committee who supports
the Bank but who opposes this rule.
Mr. LUCAS. Either amendment, I be-
lieve, would have passed the floor. One
amendment would have assured us a
signature immediately. The second
amendment would have assured us, I
believe, passage in the Senate. But the
forces fought themselves to exhaus-
tion.
I came, as I had before, to appeal to
this body as a whole. I was denied that
opportunity. So, yes, I am voting
against the rule. I will vote against the
bill because, you see, somebody that
matters greatly on the other side of
this campus said this bill will never be
heard over there, will never be heard.
I am here to make things happen,
working with you. I am here working
on behalf of our constituents, working
with you. That is what I tried.
Reject the rule. Force this back to
the Rules Committee. Give me a second
chance. Give me a second chance. But
you have to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
from Georgia for the opportunity to ex-
press my concerns.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I first want to recognize
my colleague from Oklahoma and his
passion, his history on this bill, and his
argument. I also want to thank him for
the bull analogy, although I am not
sure how the chair of the committee
might take that.
Having said that, I do want to say to
my friend from Georgia a little bit
about his comments. I find myself in
agreement whenever I come down here
on much of what Mr. WOODALL says in
terms of the aspiration of working
more together and still keeping our
unique perspectives on things.
Mr. Speaker, I would hope that he
would admit that the chair of the
Rules Committee, Mr. MCGOVERN, and
the ranking member—certainly, two of
the Members I respect the most, in ad-
dition to my colleague. We have had
these debates in the committee, and I
think that there is an earnest effort of
both parties to do better. As you said,
we can do better.
So I would like to thank my col-
league for mentioning and referring to
the instances when we did agree. I
would like to remind us all that Mr.
MCGOVERN has been very insistent on
the 72-hour rule, which has been help-
ful. We have done a higher percentage
of structured rules to date, and fewer
closed rules to date, under his leader-
ship than we did under the previous
Congress. Just 2 weeks ago, not that
this is a baseball game, there were
three times as many Republican
amendments in the natural resources
bill as there were Democratic.
Having said that, I think we can do
better.
I do want to note to my colleague
that I am a cosponsor of the Adoptee
Citizen Act, a great piece of legislation
with great authors. As we continue to
try to do more together and better to-
gether, I think you know I yearn to
serve in a body like that, where we
have legitimate differences of opinion
from our perspective, from what our
constituents expect, and there is hon-
est respect for both sides, that we cre-
ate a work product that is probably
more reflective of both. I have said
that before. We have had this discus-
sion.
In this instance, I think we are try-
ing to do better all the time. For me,
and I know for the chair and our staff,
we want to continue to work with the
gentleman to do better.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I do enjoy working with
my friend from California. When I am
critical of our work product, I am crit-
ical of all 13 of us on the Rules Com-
mittee. We are tasked with getting the
job done, and when we don’t get it
done, it falls on all of us.
I was critical earlier today of stuffing
so many things into this rule because I
like to do things one at a time. But if
we are going to stuff all the things into
this rule, Mr. Speaker, I would like to
tell my colleagues that if we defeat the
previous question, I will add one more
into this rule. It will be a collaborative
effort, not a Republican effort, a col-
laborative effort. If we defeat the pre-
vious question, Mr. Speaker, I will add
an amendment that will bring to the
floor H.R. 2207. That is the Protect
Medical Innovation Act of 2019, which
most of my colleagues know is the bill
to prevent the medical device tax,
eliminate that tax.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment and any extraneous materials in
the RECORD immediately prior to the
vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I told
you this was a bipartisan piece of legis-
lation. It has 253 bipartisan cosponsors.
It is authored by a Democrat from Wis-
consin, a great Member, Mr. KIND, and
it makes a real difference to so many
Americans. I can’t explain it as well as
my friend from Indiana can.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the

November 14, 2019
tirelessly to correct this legislative
flaw on behalf of the American people.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, as my
colleague said, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will amend
the rule to include the consideration of
the repeal of the medical device tax.
The medical device tax hurts jobs
and innovation, preventing the devel-
opment of cutting-edge, lifesaving
technologies. That also increases the
cost of patient care for all of our con-
stituents, Republican and Democrat.
There is not a corner on the market for
patient success and lifelong cures more
than the medical device tax elimi-
nation.
Hoosiers in my State are proud to be
leaders in medical innovation, with
more than 300 medical device manufac-
turers in my State alone supporting
nearly 55,000 good-paying jobs. How-
ever, after this tax took effect, the in-
dustry lost nearly 30,000 of those jobs
nationwide from 2012 to 2015, according
to the Commerce Department data.
Congress has temporarily suspended
this job-killing tax since 2016, and this
expires in January. Here we are at a
crux that we have never faced before.
We are 3 months away. Congress needs
to act today, now, not for me, for all of
us on this floor.
These folks who live and die by med-
ical devices do not declare themselves
as being Republicans, Democrats, or
independents. They are Americans in
need of our help, and they need it now.
Medical devices have literally
changed the way we think about
healthcare. In all of our districts, pa-
tients undergo less invasive proce-
dures, which leads to shorter hospital
stays. New technologies diagnose ill-
nesses earlier, lowering the impact of
care on a person’s daily life. Yet, all
these notable gains will be wiped out if
the medical device tax elimination re-
peal is not carried through here today.
It will divert millions of dollars that
could have been spent on critical in-
vestments in research and development
of cures and therapies.
b 1315
There is huge bipartisan support for
this bill. Unlike very few other bills in
this place, it is bipartisan because we
have all recognized at one time or an-
other that our constituents need our
help and we are doing something to
help them.
By defeating the previous question,
we can do that. We can unleash the po-
tential of the medical device tech-
nology that could be developing better
treatments, managing chronic care,
and improving the quality of life for
people in all of our districts.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote against the previous question.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I can’t say it any better
than my friend from Oklahoma said it.
He supports the goal of the underlying
bill. He is going to oppose this rule be-
cause his ideas were not even heard,
not that his ideas weren’t put into the
language, but that he was not even al-
lowed a chance to debate his ideas.
I will say it again: Only two Repub-
lican ideas were made in order for con-
sideration in this rule, and more
amendments were given to individual
members of the Democratic Party than
the entire Republican Party combined.
That is not the way we ought to be
doing things. We ought to have a full
airing of issues and concerns.
You heard it from the gentleman
from Oklahoma, vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule.
But also vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous
question.
Mr. Speaker, you heard from my
friend from Indiana. We have an oppor-
tunity in a bipartisan way to solve a
nationwide problem by eliminating the
medical device tax. Everybody from
the far left to the far right knows it;
from the east, to the west, to the
north, to the south. We can do this to-
gether.
If we have to do this closed rule that
eliminates the diversity of ideas in this
institution, then let’s at least do it
with the medical device tax language
included.
Vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question.
Add that language. If we can’t defeat
the previous question, I am going to
have to ask my colleagues to defeat the
rule and see if we can’t come back with
a process that opens up this bill to
more voices; not just from across the
parties, but from across the country.
We can do better than this. My col-
leagues know it, as do I.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
It is always a pleasure to be down
here or on the Rules Committee with
my friend from Georgia. I appreciate
what we agree with, and I appreciate
the passion that the gentleman brings
when he disagrees with us.
I do want to say, as we fight for these
things, there was a famous Frenchman
who President Reagan used to quote,
the quote was: ‘‘Don’t let the perfect be
the enemy of the good.’’
So somewhere in there, in this proc-
ess I think we try to find the best prod-
uct we can. I believe what we have in
front of us is that product. And I do
also think and commit to this that we
can always do better.
Mr. Speaker, a vote for this rule and
this bill is a vote to promote Amer-
ican-made jobs, goods, and the Amer-
ican economy.
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and
the previous question.
The text of the material previously
referred to by Mr. WOODALL is as fol-
lows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 695
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this
resolution, the House shall proceed to the
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R.
2207) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 to repeal the excise tax on medical de-
vices. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. The bill shall be
considered as read. All points of order
against provisions in the bill are waived. The
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and on any amendment
thereto to final passage without intervening
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on
Ways and Means; and (2) one motion to re-
commit.
SEC. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not
apply to the consideration of H.R. 2207.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time and
move the previous question on the res-
olution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, on that
I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-
minute vote on ordering the previous
question will be followed by 5-minute

Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on H.R. 4863 and to insert extra-
neous materials thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 695 and rule

the Committee of the Whole House on
the state of the Union for the consider-
ation of the bill, H.R. 4863.
The Chair appoints the gentleman
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) to pre-

b 1409
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 4863) to
promote the competitiveness of the
United States, to reform and reauthor-
ize the United States Export Finance
Agency, and for other purposes, with
Mr. BLUMENAUER in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Financial Services.
The gentlewoman from California
(Ms. WATERS) and the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY) each
will control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4863, the United States Ex-
port Finance Agency Act of 2019.
H.R. 4863 reauthorizes and makes key
improvements to the job-creating Ex-
port-Import Bank. Let me begin by de-
scribing why the Ex-Im Bank is so im-
portant.
The Ex-Im Bank was established 85
years ago and is the official export
credit agency of the United States. Its
mission is to promote the export of
U.S. goods and services in order to help
create and sustain jobs in the United
States.
Over the last 10 years, the Ex-Im
Bank has supported more than 1.5 mil-
lion American jobs at no cost to the
taxpayer, financed more than $255 bil-
lion in U.S. exports, and remitted more
than $3.4 billion in deficit-reducing re-
ceipts to the Treasury.
In my district, the Ex-Im Bank is
currently financing $269 million worth
of exports from 13 different exporters,
including 10 small businesses.
Ex-Im does not compete with the pri-
vate sector but, instead, fills in gaps
when the private sector lacks the ca-
pacity or willingness to provide the fi-
nancing required by U.S. exporters.
During the financial crisis, the Ex-Im
Bank was an important source of fi-
nancing when private capital was sim-
ply unavailable to many businesses.
Ex-Im estimates that during fiscal year
2010, in the depths of the financial cri-
sis, it supported 227,000 jobs at more
than 3,300 companies.
The Bank also plays a key role in
leveling the international playing field
by offsetting the financing offered by
foreign export credit agencies. The Ex-
Im Bank is one of more than 100 export
credit agencies around the world that
help their home-country exporters
compete in the global markets.
If we fail to reauthorize the Bank,
American businesses will be harmed,
and thousands of jobs will be lost.
Unfortunately, in 2015, the Repub-
lican leadership in the House allowed
the Bank’s charter to expire for the
first time in the Bank’s history. At
that time, a number of countries, in-
cluding China, celebrated the Bank’s
closure because of the competitive ad-
vantage it gave them over U.S. busi-
nesses and workers.
Later, Republicans in the Senate
hobbled Ex-Im for 4 years by refusing
to confirm board directors, which pre-
vented them from having a quorum.
Ex-Im reported that it was unable to
approve $40 billion worth of trans-
actions during this period, which would

H.R. 4863 is intended to renew the
confidence of U.S. exporters in the Ex-
Im Bank while also sending a message
to the world that the U.S. is ready and
is prepared to aggressively compete in
overseas export markets.
H.R. 4863 reauthorizes the Ex-Im
Bank for 10 years and increases the
Bank’s lending authority from $135 bil-
lion to $175 billion. The bill strength-
ens support for small businesses, which
are the engine of growth in our econ-
omy, and it creates an Office of Minor-
ity and Women Inclusion as well as an
Office of Territorial Exporting to sup-
port exporters in Guam, Puerto Rico,
the Virgin Islands, and other U.S. ter-
ritories.
The bill also focuses the Bank’s at-
tention on protecting the environment
by creating an office for renewable en-
ergy exports, strengthening the Bank’s
environmental policies and procedures,
and encouraging greater accountability
with respect to local communities that
could be negatively affected by Bank-
supported projects.
Importantly, H.R. 4863 also includes
procedures to avoid a lapse in the
Board’s quorum so that the Bank can
maintain its full operational capacity
even when the Senate is unable to con-
firm Board directors.
The bill includes a number of provi-
sions to ensure that Ex-Im financing
does not inadvertently support bad ac-
tors. For example, the bill prohibits fi-
nancing for the Chinese military, the
Chinese intelligence services, and any
other bad actors, including anyone who
has criminally violated the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act or has violated
U.S. intellectual property laws.
Moreover, H.R. 4863 would require the
parties to an Ex-Im transaction to cer-
tify that neither they nor any of their
subsidiaries engage in activities in vio-
lation of U.S.-sanctioned laws.
So, Mr. Chairman, it is imperative
that we reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank so
that our businesses, U.S. businesses
large and small, will have the financ-
ing support they need to compete in
the global markets while preserving
and creating American jobs at home.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Today I rise in opposition to H.R.
4863. The bill we are debating today en-
capsulates so much of what is wrong in
Congress today.
This is a partisan bill to reauthorize
what a bipartisan group supports, and
it is a failure of legislating. That is
why we have a partisan bill on the
House floor to reauthorize the Export-
Import Bank.
This bill passed the House Financial
Services Committee by three votes,
with Republicans all in opposition and
a few of my Democratic colleagues in
opposition, as well. To say this is dis-
appointing, though, is an understate-
ment.
Earlier this year, Chairwoman
WATERS and I joined together to intro-
duce a bipartisan Ex-Im reauthoriza-
tion bill, and it is here in the House
known as H.R. 3407. It included sensible
reforms for Ex-Im that both parties
could support.
The chairwoman and I spent hours
negotiating this package, but, unfortu-
nately, she didn’t have the support
from her fellow Democrats to bring
that to markup, and that is a sad
thing. It is a sad thing because, in that
bill, we took on the generational chal-
lenge that is incumbent upon us as
American policymakers to be sensible
about, which is the threat and aggres-
sion of China, both the economic and
military aggressiveness of that regime.
The bill that we negotiated would
have served as the most comprehensive
and the longest extension to an author-
ization of the Ex-Im Bank, and it had a
chance to get the President’s signature
and actually be legislated in the Sen-
ate, as well.
Sadly, the Democrats walked away
from that agreement because it limited
Ex-Im’s subsidies to some businesses
owned by the Chinese Communist
Party. The Democratic majority
stripped out all the reforms we had
agreed to, and what we are left with in
this bill text is a restatement of cur-
rent law and current practice by the
Export-Import Bank on this list of Chi-
nese businesses that the Bank cannot
do business with. They don’t do busi-
ness with them, and that creates an-
other glaring hole for abuse.
The President has a Statement of Ad-
ministration Policy just issued from
the White House, and it says the Presi-
dent would veto this bill, so it is not
going to get signed into law.
Moreover, the Senate majority leader
said this morning: ‘‘’We’re not going to
pass the House bill,’ McConnell said.’’
We do not want that bill. ‘‘We do want
to extend Ex-Im. A logical place to do
that would be on the CR,’’ on the con-
tinuing resolution, which will happen.
That is what is going to happen.
So those watching, those listening
here, this is all a show; and at the end
of the day, this won’t make it into law.
We are going to have a clean extension
of this Bank, which is an important
economic tool for us.
In our bipartisan agreement, though,
the most important compromise we
had reached is that provision to limit
Ex-Im’s support for the Chinese Com-
munist Party.
As we all know, Beijing poses a stra-
tegic threat to our national interest
through its economic and military ag-
gression. We know about the Chinese
Government’s shocking abuse of
human rights. We see this in Hong
Kong and the suppression of freedom
there.
We know the Chinese Government’s
true motives for the Belt and Road Ini-
tiative and the Made in China 2025 ini-
tiative, and that is to extend China’s
global dominance.
They are not a strategic ally; they
are a threat. And if we are savvy to
this, we will ensure that we don’t take
an important tool of our government
and subsidize Beijing. If we want to
counter Beijing’s ambitions, we
shouldn’t use Ex-Im to provide cheap
financing for the Chinese Communist
Party.
To compete with Beijing, we cannot
subsidize Beijing. It is bad policy for
Americans, and we should agree on
that. And, in fact, we did in the bill
that Chairwoman WATERS and I filed.
To be clear, Republicans support sell-
ing American goods and services
around the globe and in China. That is
why we support the reset of the trade
arrangement with China that the
President is negotiating. It is a very
important thing.
We also know that the Chinese Com-
munist Party sits on $3 trillion of dol-
lar-denominated reserves. This debate
is not about commerce; it is about fi-
nancial assistance. Why use a mecha-
nism of our government to subsidize
the Chinese economy? Why would we
do that? That is not sound policy. That
is not good policy.
And when we marked up this bill, the
Democrats raised two interesting
counterarguments to this view. The
first one was—amazingly and, I think,
absurdly—that the Financial Services
Committee should not weigh in on any
international matter, even though at
Ex-Im’s creation, the focus was on
Marxist-Leninist countries and Soviet
aggression internationally. We wanted
more trading partners to us in selling
American goods. Well, I think, like-
wise, we have a similar challenge with
China this day.
Even though Ex-Im has been used as
a tool of foreign policy from the very
beginning, this argument was made in
committee.
We also have important work that we
do with oversight of the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, a
number of global institutions coming
out of the financial services arena. All
of these things fall under the Financial
Services Committee’s purview, and
Democrats on this committee
shouldn’t opine that Ex-Im can’t get
into this. Ex-Im, at its creation, got
into it and continues to get into it; and
that is the nature of Ex-Im financing:
to have more allies with us in opposi-
tion to other regimes around the globe.
The second argument the Democrats
put forth is that their partisan bill has
limits on China anyway because it bars
Ex-Im from financing the People’s Lib-
eration Army, which current law pre-
vents American companies from doing
that directly. So it is a restatement of
policy, existing law.
It says that companies on the De-
partment of Commerce’s entity list are
banned from financing. Well, the joke’s
on that argument because those people
on the entity list, we can’t do com-
merce with them—not even a question
of who subsidizes it or not.

November 14, 2019
So it is all a complete kabuki dance.
And it is of no surprise to folks watch-
ing or listening to this debate that Ex-
Im doesn’t provide financial products
to the submarine force of the Chinese
Navy. Nice try, very cute, but we don’t
do that.
However, Ex-Im does provide financ-
ing for companies that the Chinese
military can control to achieve Bei-
jing’s strategic objectives. In the lan-
guage of this bill, we will have a
handy-dandy chart that no one at
home can read. We have a massive
chart. It doesn’t matter. We have a
long list of entities that Ex-Im could
still subsidize that this bill doesn’t af-
fect, does not touch.
So the Democrats put in this bill
meaningless language for political
cover rather than to do something
right and real for the American econ-
omy. They don’t have a response for
the deep questions of Chinese aggres-
sion.
Ex-Im does provide financing to com-
panies like AsiaSat, which is con-
trolled by the Chinese Government and
has helped Chinese security forces
crack down on protesters in western
China. Again, the Democrats’ bill
would do nothing to stop any of that,
as one example.
And, of course, the Democrat bill
does nothing to stop Ex-Im from fi-
nancing government-controlled compa-
nies that are acting contrary to our na-
tional interests but which may not
happen to be on this entity list of the
Commerce Department.
Take Huawei, for example, which Ex-
Im had authorized transactions for be-
fore the company was put onto the en-
tity list in May. This is a recent exam-
ple.
Under the Democrats’ bill, Ex-Im
subsidies for Huawei were perfectly
fine in April, but in May were unac-
ceptable. That is ridiculous. And it is
bad policy for the American taxpayer
to subsidize Chinese aggression.
By the same token, under the Demo-
crats’ bill, Ex-Im would safely finance
Chinese Government-controlled ZTE
Corporation up until April 15 of 2018,
when it was put on the Commerce’s De-
nied Persons List. At that point, Ex-Im
would no longer be able to finance
ZTE, except that it could finance ZTE
just 3 months later when it was taken
off the list.
Is anyone confused? Yes, you should
be confused. This is the type of inco-
herent nonsense that this partisan bill
has in it. It is not good for our national
security. It is not smart policy. It is
not good policy.
So, as a reminder, ZTE is China’s sec-
ond largest producer of telecommuni-
cations equipment, and it was involved
in violations of our export control and
sanctions laws with respect to Iran and
North Korea. According to the Demo-
crats’ bill, taxpayer assistance should
be flowing through Ex-Im Bank to
ZTE. I don’t think that is really what
they want, but that is what their legis-
lative text does.
These are just a few of the many ex-
amples of companies controlled by the
Chinese Communist Party that the
Democrat majority wants the Export-
Import Bank to cater to under this bill.
Again, we can’t let that happen. We
should not let that happen. That is not
good policy. It is not commensurate
with where we are as a nation with this
rising threat of China.
I want to reiterate my support of an
extension of the Ex-Im Bank’s authori-
ties to ensure that the Bank remains
open to support U.S. jobs and exports
and job creation around the globe, but
with a caveat that we should not be
doing it in China to fund their aggres-
sion.
So I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. We
will have an extension of the Bank. It
will happen. It will be a bipartisan
vote.
This, though, is a bad bill that does
not deserve to pass the House of Rep-
resentatives. And even if it does pass
the House of Representatives, it is
going nowhere in the Senate. And even
if it passes the Senate, the President
says he is going to veto it.
So let’s think calmly and rationally
about it. Let’s not waste the people’s
time here in the House of Representa-
tives with a needless debate on some-
thing that is going to go nowhere. Let’s
actually work on something that could
take us somewhere.
We had a bipartisan bill. Sadly, the
majority walked away from it.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I would
just like to remind this body that Mr.
MCHENRY is one of the ones responsible
for the nonreauthorization of the Ex-
Im Bank before. He didn’t support it
then, and he doesn’t support it now,
and he never will because he is opposed
to Ex-Im Bank reauthorization, period.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to
the gentleman from Washington (Mr.
HECK), a key sponsor of this legislation
and a major supporter of Ex-Im.
Mr. HECK. I thank Chair WATERS for
yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I also am not going to
spend much time rebutting the argu-
ments of the previous speaker, indeed,
given that he has opposed every single
reauthorization of the Ex-Im since he
began service in this Chamber—espe-
cially since he supported every amend-
ment that would have been harmful in
past reauthorization legislation; espe-
cially since he had the audacity, frank-
ly, to use Huawei as an example, which
he cannot cite a single line in the draft
to which he refers that would have pro-
hibited export financing to Huawei,
and the bill before you does.
b 1430
No. I am going to use my time to do
as I have in the past: to support and de-
fend the bank, one of the most impor-
tant, least understood elements of our
national manufacturing strategy, the
Export-Import Bank.
It is vital to our national and local
economies, especially manufacturers,
farmers, and small businesses, but it
has suffered badly under misguided at-
tacks, such as that to which you were
just treated. I have seen this damage
firsthand, despite our ongoing at-
tempts to fight them.
This year, I am pleased and proud
that we finally have an opportunity to
reverse that damage and reinvigorate
and expand the Ex-Im.
I support the Export-Import Bank be-
cause we want to see more U.S. ex-
ports. The international market for
goods and services is three times as
large as our domestic economy, and
that gap, by the way, is widening.
The American economy has not his-
torically been export oriented, so tar-
geting foreign markets and increasing
exports holds untapped promise to
raise living standards.
As I like to say, if we want to keep
our middle class, we better sell into the
world’s growing middle class.
Maximizing exports will require a
strong Export-Import Bank. Over the
last many years, the committee has
heard testimony and seen analysis that
the private market will not maximize
exports if left to its own devices.
Trade financing markets fail in pre-
dictable and repeated ways. The scale
is too large for new exporters to access;
the timeframes are too short for the
largest, most expensive products; and
there are some countries that private
lenders simply will not lend into.
So without a robust official export
credit agency to fill these gaps, we sim-
ply lose out on overseas sales, espe-
cially for small businesses and capital
equipment makers and farmers.
Every country recognizes this fact,
but the U.S. alone among major econo-
mies has failed to fully act on this
knowledge.
If we want to maximize our exports,
we need to stop the sabotage of our
credit agency, the Ex-Im Bank, and en-
hance it. This is what this reauthoriza-
tion bill does.
It does make several critical
changes. It sets the bill up to succeed
by increasing the spending cap and ex-
panding the ability to use reinsurance
to lay off risk, and setting up new au-
thorities for the bank to go out and
search for foreign buyers who it can
match with U.S. suppliers, American
jobs.
It attempts to move past some of the
misinformation about the agency’s
purpose that has dogged the reauthor-
ization fight the last many years by re-
naming it to focus on its sole purpose:
financing and expanding exports of
U.S.-made goods.
It preserves the requirement that
goods must be made in the United
States by U.S. workers in order to
qualify for assistance from the agency.
This is the strongest domestic content
requirement in the world, and it rein-
forces that the core of Ex-Im’s mission
is supporting U.S. manufacturing jobs.
It continues Ex-Im’s historical role
in leading export credit agencies

around the world toward higher envi-
ronmental standards, stricter pollution
controls, and more concern for the ef-
fects of infrastructure projects in de-
veloping countries.
This is a legacy to be proud of and to
build on, and I am glad to see that our
environmental advocates and our ex-
port sector have come together to
agree on the importance of this lan-
guage.
It aligns Ex-Im more closely with
U.S. foreign policy and anticorruption
efforts. Ex-Im financing will now be
barred if a foreign customer appears on
any one of several bad actor lists main-
tained by various agencies of the U.S.
Government.
No, Mr. Chair, it is not a restatement
of current policy. It is an expansion of
it, and they full well know it.
These targeted provisions allow Ex-
Im to focus on maximizing U.S. sales
to good customers while also increas-
ing the leverage that our foreign pol-
icymakers have in encouraging foreign
countries and corporations to clean up
their act.
Finally, it makes it much faster and
easier for Ex-Im to match financing
terms with those foreign export credit
agencies that subsidize financing in
their country’s exporters.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield an
additional 1 minute to the gentleman.
Mr. HECK. Mr. Chair, I thank Chair-
woman WATERS for yielding.
Mr. Chair, China, in particular, has
used this tactic to crowd out U.S. man-
ufacturers, and Ex-Im will finally have
the tool it needs to counter this tactic.
I am proud of the work we have done
on this bill. Building a stronger Ex-
port-Import Bank, if I may be personal
for just one second, is one of the main
reasons why I was asked and honored
to become a member of the Financial
Services Committee 7 years ago.
This is a bill that would achieve that
mission for a decade to come, and I
urge all of my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes.’’
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, let me restate that, as I
said in my opening statement, to be
clear, the bill that Chairwoman
WATERS and I filed, H.R. 3407, is a 7-
year extension of the Export-Import
Bank.
It is clear by my cosponsorship of
that with Chairwoman WATERS that I
support reauthorizing the Bank. And as
I said in my opening statement, I sup-
port the Bank staying open through
the continuing resolution or the appro-
priations vehicle, whatever it is that is
going to become law. So I will restate
that to both my colleagues so they can
hear.
Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
HUIZENGA), the ranking member of the
Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship
and Capital Markets Subcommittee.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I appre-
ciate Mr. MCHENRY yielding to me, and
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4863,
the United States Export Finance
Agency Act.
According to its charter, the mission
of the Export-Import Bank is to ‘‘con-
tribute to maintaining or increasing
employment of United States workers’’
by subsidizing the export of U.S. goods
and services to foreign markets.
Over the years, Congress has amend-
ed Ex-Im’s charter to reflect numerous
congressional interests regarding lend-
ing practices, transparency, and for-
eign policy objectives, so much so, that
the Bank’s charter has grown from four
pages at its inception to more than 150
pages now, and with that expansion, we
have seen the Bank expand its portfolio
to a staggering $135 billion.
Well, each reauthorization of the Ex-
port-Import Bank has afforded Con-
gress the opportunity to revisit the
charter and to work for reform and to
modernize the Bank appropriately.
However, this flawed partisan proposal
that we have before us today fails to
make any meaningful reforms to the
Export-Import Bank.
Now, despite the claims that you are
hearing across the aisle about the com-
pany not being able to do business with
China and Russia, this simply isn’t the
fact.
In fact, I had an amendment, two
amendments, that would have actually
not allowed the bank to deal with
state-owned enterprises in China and in
Russia.
Now, why? Because of this: the
human rights record in China is deplor-
able. We are seeing it play out today in
Hong Kong, literally, right now.
We also know that we are battling
the Belt and Road Initiative that has
been a Chinese initiative that has gone
around the world, and it has no busi-
ness getting U.S. taxpayer dollars in
support of it.
Well, this initiative allows the Bank
to provide taxpayer financing to enti-
ties owned and controlled by the Chi-
nese Government, including Chinese
state-owned enterprises involved in
military activities, human rights
abuses, and this Belt and Road Initia-
tive.
At a time when China is diverting
massive subsidies to state-owned enter-
prises, specifically through the use of
export subsidies, why would Congress
authorize the use of taxpayer dollars to
make the Chinese Communist Party’s
job easier? I am baffled by that.
Now, claims of the opposite can be
repeated and they can be repeated in
louder and louder voices, but that still
doesn’t make it true.
The simple fact is my amendment
that was rejected by the other side of
the aisle would have limited inter-
action with Chinese and Russian state-
owned actors.
Well, we all know that the primary
goal of the Export-Import Bank is to
support American jobs through ex-
ports. However, any Ex-Im reauthoriza-
tion that doesn’t address the strategic
threat to our national interests posed
by China’s economic and military ef-
forts is not in the best interests of
American workers or jobs.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield the
gentleman an additional 30 seconds.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I will
move quickly through this.
Yes, it is true, I have been a sharp
critic of the Export-Import Bank. I
have been accused of wanting to do
nothing more than shut it down by the
other side, as much was said to the
ranking member.
However, I was also a part of a group
trying to come up with a bipartisan
agreement in 2012 and 2015, and I was
willing to support the bipartisan bill
that was introduced by the ranking
member and the chair.
I wasn’t necessarily happy with all
the provisions, but I felt that there was
sufficient and significant progress
made in those much-needed reforms.
Well, unfortunately, this bipartisan
agreement was abandoned by the other
side. The bill that we have before us is
a flawed bill, and I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no.’’
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I would like
to remind the House that the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA)
has 16 total exporters in his district,
would support a value of $52 million. I
would hope that as he opposes this bill,
he is reminded that between 2014 and
2020, his district received substantial
support.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN), a
strong supporter of the Bank and the
chair of the Subcommittee on Over-
sight and Investigations of the Com-
mittee on Financial Services.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I
thank Madam Chair for yielding. In-
deed, I am a strong supporter of the
Bank and I am also a strong supporter
of the chairwoman.
I support this legislation because the
Export Bank is not a traditional bank.
Traditional banks take deposits. The
Ex-Im Bank makes deposits.
Over the last 10 years, it has depos-
ited 1.5 million jobs, American jobs;
over the last 10 years, $3.4 billion in the
U.S. Treasury; over the last 10 years,
$255 billion to those who are exporting
by way of financing these exports.
In the way of jobs, if we look at the
State of Texas, we can see that from
2014 to 2019, it has assisted 91 minority-
owned businesses, 14 percent of which
are in my district; 467 small business
exporters; 55 women-owned exporters.
A total of 810 businesses have benefited
from the Ex-Im Bank.
If you like diversity, you will love
the Ex-Im Bank. It has within it an Of-
fice of Minority and Women Inclusion.
It will have an Office of Territorial Ex-
porting to help Guam, Puerto Rico, and
the U.S. territories.
I support the Ex-Im Bank because it
not only makes good sense, it makes
good dollars and cents.
This is a bill that we should support.
If we didn’t have the Ex-Im Bank, we

would invent it. Why reinvent the
wheel when we have something that
can roll out right now?
Mr. Chair, I support this bill.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR), the ranking member
of the Oversight and Investigations
Subcommittee.
Mr. BARR. Mr. Chair, I rise today in
opposition to this bill, not because I
believe the Export-Import Bank should
not exist under any circumstances, but
because I believe we can produce a bet-
ter bill, a bill that would actually help
America compete while holding other
nations like China accountable in the
global market.
I am concerned that the bill in its
current form would actually enable
China’s malign activities to the det-
riment of U.S. national security.
Now, let me be clear. I supported the
compromise bill that Chairwoman
WATERS and Ranking Member
MCHENRY negotiated in June, and I
compliment my friend, the gentleman
from North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY)
for his leadership on this. I recognize
the value a reformed Ex-Im Bank can
provide to U.S. businesses.
The new Ex-Im president and chair-
man, Kimberly Reed, has impressed
me. She visited my district and made
clear her commitment to helping U.S.
exporters, including small businesses
in Kentucky, compete in the global
market. She also, importantly, com-
mitted to reforming the Bank to aban-
don Obama-era policies that discrimi-
nated against Ex-Im support of tradi-
tional fossil energy and related ex-
ports.
But the bill we are debating today
cannot be fixed by a strong leader like
Kimberly Reed. It is flawed, it is not
the right answer, and we can and
should do better.
Specifically, this bill does not go far
enough to combat malign Chinese in-
fluence and China’s aspirations to re-
place the United States as the pre-
eminent global economic power.
b 1445
The Communists in Beijing continue
to steal our intellectual property and
place their thumb on the scale of glob-
al economic competitiveness by prop-
ping up its economy through state-
owned enterprises.
Additionally, we see rampant human
rights abuses and violent quashing of
freedom seekers in Hong Kong. Over
the last 5 months, we have observed
protestors in Hong Kong being shot,
beaten, gassed, and arrested.
My amendment to this bill, which
the Rules Committee did not make in
order, would have made Ex-Im assist-
ance to Chinese state-owned enter-
prises contingent on their commitment
to upholding the Sino-British declara-
tion, which established the ‘‘one coun-
try, two systems’’ principle that would
allow Hong Kong to retain its capi-
talist system.
In his book ‘‘The Hundred-Year Mar-
athon,’’ former senior Defense Depart-
ment official Michael Pillsbury details
China’s strategy to supplant the
United States as the world’s dominant
power by 2049, the 100th anniversary of
the founding of the People’s Republic.
He said, ‘‘Only recently have there
been disturbing signs that a more mili-
taristic China may be ascendant, which
has caused some to question the wish-
ful thinking that has prevailed for
more than 40 years.’’
Unless we take a hard stand and a
hard line against China, including
through more powerful restrictions on
the Ex-Im Bank’s interactions with
Chinese SOEs, we risk ceding our pre-
eminence in a fair and free global mar-
ket.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this bill, which will allow U.S.
taxpayer funds to subsidize Chinese as-
cendency and its Communist state-
owned enterprises and enable China’s
theft of our intellectual property, its
forced transfer of technology, and its
blatant violation of human rights.
This bill could be better. The Export-
Import Bank could help us combat Chi-
nese growing imports. This bill doesn’t
do it.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I would like
to again remind Mr. BARR that between
2014 and 2020, his State received $10
million in total export value.
I would also like to remind this body
that he did not support reauthorization
in the past. He does not do it now. I
don’t know if there will ever be a good
enough bill to have him and the rank-
ing member support Export-Import.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA).
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chair,
first, I thank the gentlewoman from
California, and my chairwoman, for her
leadership in bringing this incredibly
important bill to the floor.
Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support
of the Ex-Im Bank.
Mr. Chair, the Bank provides tar-
geted credit and export support to our
small businesses that need it most to
stay competitive. We know that the
Bank’s programs work, and we should
not abandon them.
I fully support the reauthorization.
The Ex-Im Bank plays an irreplaceable
role in promoting American exports
and keeping small businesses competi-
tive on the international market and
helps in creating jobs for America,
some 352,000 jobs.
Since 2014, the Bank has provided
over $450 million worth of export sup-
port value in my district alone in the
Houston area. Among the 53 total ex-
porters supported in my district, 39—
well over half—are small businesses. In
Texas, the Bank has supported $12 bil-
lion in exports and 815 exporters, in-
cluding 470 small businesses.
Along with the reauthorization of
this bill, it also includes an Office of
Women and Minority Inclusion. This is
important because, in my district
alone, seven out of the 53 businesses
are minority-owned and four are fe-
male-owned.
Additionally, this bill includes com-
monsense environmental and commu-
nity engagement standards that seek
to make sure the Bank is helping meet
our Paris climate accord commit-
ments.
While these improvements to the
Bank contained in the bill are impor-
tant, I don’t want to take away from
the bottom-line fact, and that is it cre-
ates jobs.
This bill supports American manu-
facturers. This bill supports our ex-
porting sector. This bill helps reduce
our trade deficit. That is why I am
calling on all of my colleagues to join
me in passing this critical legislation.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL), the ranking member of
the Subcommittee on National Secu-
rity, International Development and
Monetary Policy.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair, I
thank my friend from North Carolina
for yielding. I congratulate the ranking
member and the chairwoman for trying
to work together to produce a bipar-
tisan bill that we can all support and
demonstrate our keen interest in a
long-term, bipartisan reauthorization
of the Ex-Im Bank, an important for-
eign policy tool for this Nation, not
just in the situation with China, but
generally.
To my friend from Washington who
talked about Huawei a few minutes
ago, it is not just state-owned enter-
prises that we are concerned about. It
is not public companies in China we are
concerned about, or private companies
in China. We are concerned with any-
one who has engaged in something that
is going to challenge the national secu-
rity of this country.
I would remind my friends on the
other side that China’s laws say: Any
organization or citizen shall support,
assist, and cooperate with the People’s
Republic of China intelligence effort.
They shall provide all efforts truth-
fully and may not refuse.
So it is not just small companies or
state-owned enterprises; it is all com-
panies in China that we have that risk.
I offered an amendment that was
turned down by the Rules Committee,
ruled out of order by the majority, to
try to tackle the issue of intellectual
property, something we have dealt
with in this country for 30 years. That
was going to be an effort, I think, in
this compromise bill that would have
been so helpful, had we been able to
successfully get it done.
I have been a longtime advocate for
proceeding with care as it relates to
foreign policy with China. There is no
doubt that intellectual property is at
the heart of that challenge, and the
Bank has a role to play as it reviews fi-
nancing activities in China for our
businesses.
Nothing has been more pirated than
computer software, music CDs, and
Hollywood videos. All that has been
taken by the People’s Republic of
China to the detriment of business in

America. It plagued President Clinton;
it plagued President Bush 43; and it
plagued President Obama.
Mr. Chair, let’s work together on a
bipartisan bill that we can all support.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, this is an-
other Member on the opposite side of
the aisle, the gentleman from Arkan-
sas, who, when we were trying to get
the Bank up and running, he voted
against reauthorization. He is voting
against it again today. I don’t know
what it would take to make these
Members who have consistently op-
posed reauthorization to ever support
Ex-Im.
I would like to remind him there are
10 exporters in his district for a total of
$43 million—that is a total value of ex-
port—between 2014 and 2020.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. STAN-
TON).
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of
H.R. 4863, the United States Export Fi-
nance Agency Act, which will reau-
thorize the Export-Import Bank for 10
years.
I am proud to cosponsor and support
this bill for one simple reason: Busi-
nesses across Arizona looking to create
great jobs and export their products
across our international borders need
certainty to succeed.
Main Street is still the backbone of
my State’s economy, and the Export-
Import Bank is an essential tool to en-
sure they remain competitive in an in-
creasingly competitive global market.
I want to highlight one business
headquartered in Tempe in my district.
First Solar focuses on securing the en-
ergy of the future by developing next-
generation PV technology.
The company exports solar panel
technology around the world and has
benefited from nearly $4 million in ex-
port financing from the Bank. First
Solar is just one of the many environ-
mentally friendly companies that bene-
fits from the Export-Import Bank.
In Arizona, four out of five exporters
supported by the Bank are small busi-
nesses. In the last 5 years alone, it has
supported upward of $2 billion in ex-
ports in my State.
Congress has a duty to reassert its
role in U.S. trade policies as exporters
continue to face challenges on all
fronts. If we can’t find common ground
and reauthorize the Bank, we will be
removing one of the most essential
tools American companies have.
Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this important bill
in order to provide certainty and to
level the playing field for American
businesses across the country.
Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman
WATERS for leading this important ef-
fort.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, if I may
inquire of the Chair how much time re-
mains on both sides.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
North Carolina has 91⁄2 minutes remain-
ing. The gentlewoman from California
has 111⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I am
pleased that the gentleman from Ari-
zona just talked about the kind of sup-
port he has in his district. Let me re-
mind the House that we have support
from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
Aerospace Industries Association,
International Association of Machin-
ists and Aerospace Workers, AFL–CIO,
International Federation of Profes-
sional and Technical Engineers, Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers,
Boeing, and Air Tractor, Inc. What you
have here is business and labor have
come together to support this most im-
portant bill.
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD
letters of support.
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Washington, DC, October 28, 2019.
Hon. MAXINE WATERS,
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY,
Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Serv-
ices,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS AND RANKING
MEMBER MCHENRY: The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce thanks the committee for consid-
ering legislation to provide for long-term re-
authorizations of the Terrorism Risk Insur-
ance Act (‘‘TRIA’’) program and the Export-
Import Bank of the United States (‘‘Ex-Im’’).
The Chamber strongly supports the sub-
stitute amendment to H.R. 4634, the ‘‘Ter-
rorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2019.’’ The Chamber also strongly
supports the ‘‘United States Export Finance
Agency Act of 2019,’’ and opposes all amend-
ments that are intended to serve as ‘‘poison
pills’’ which would prevent this legislation
from viable consideration on the House floor
or in the Senate.
H.R. 4634, THE ‘‘TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE
PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2019’’
Since its initial enactment in 2002, TRlA
has served as a vital public-private risk shar-
ing mechanism, ensuring that private ter-
rorism risk insurance coverage remains com-
mercially available and that the U.S. econ-
omy would more swiftly recover in the event
of a terrorist attack.
The Chamber strongly supports the sub-
stitute amendment to H.R. 4634, the ‘‘Ter-
rorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2019,’’ and applauds the leader-
ship of Chairwoman Waters and Ranking
Member McHenry in reaching this bipartisan
deal which would provide a seven-year reau-
thorization of this important program while
providing for a study on the evolving risks in
cyberterrorism and the affordability and
availability of TRIA coverage for places of
worship.
THE ‘‘UNITED STATES EXPORT FINANCE AGENCY
ACT OF 2019’’
As the official U.S. export credit agency
(‘‘ECA’’), Ex-lm’s mission is to support do-
mestic jobs by facilitating the export of
goods or services when private sector lenders
are unable or unwilling to provide financing.
Foreign governments have established 113
ECAs of their own around the world. In 2018,
China’s two ECAs alone provided 130 times as
much medium- and long-term export credit
support as the Ex-Im Bank. Due to the ex-
tensive competition in this space, it is vital
that Ex-Im be reauthorized to ensure that
U.S. businesses and workers are not deprived
of a basic tool enjoyed by their competitors
in every other country.
The Chamber strongly supports the
‘‘United States Export Finance Agency Act
of 2019.’’ This legislation builds off of S. 2293,
the ‘‘Export-Import Bank Reauthorization
Act of 2019,’’ which was introduced earlier
this year with the bipartisan support of Sen-
ators Kevin Cramer and Kyrsten Sinema,
and cosponsored by Senators Thom Tillis,
Maria Cantwell, Roy Blunt, Patty Murray,
Lindsey Graham, Chris Coons, Susan Collins
and Maggie Hassan. This legislation would
provide exporters with 10 years of much-
needed certainty.
In May, the Senate confirmed three of Ex-
Im’s board members, establishing a quorum
for the first time since 2015 and finally mak-
ing the Bank fully functional after several
years of being limited to only supporting
transactions less than $10 million. This bill
would also establish an alternative proce-
dure during any future lapses in the board’s
quorum to ensure that Ex-Im can continue
to serve its vital role in supporting U.S. jobs.
U.S. exporters and the hundreds of thou-
sands of jobs that they support need long-
term certainty—simply extending the life of
Ex-Im through short-term continuing resolu-
tions is not enough. The Chamber strongly
urges members of the Committee to vote in
support of this long-term legislation and
urges members to oppose the adoption of any
‘‘poison pill’’ amendments that are intended
to prevent this legislation from viable con-
sideration on the House floor or in the U.S.
Senate.
The Chamber thanks you for your atten-
tion on these important issues and looks for-
ward to working with you to ensure long-
term reauthorizations of both of these im-
portant programs.
Sincerely,
NEIL L. BRADLEY,
Executive Vice President & Chief Policy
Officer.
U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,
CONGRESSIONAL & PUBLIC AFFAIRS,
Washington, DC, November 11, 2019.
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES: The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce strongly supports H.R. 4863, the
‘‘United States Export Finance Agency Act
of 2019,’’ which would provide for a long-term
reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank
(‘‘Ex-Im’’). The Chamber will consider in-
cluding votes on this legislation—including
votes on amendments—in our annual How
They Voted scorecard.
As the official U.S. export credit agency
(‘‘ECA’’), Ex-Im’s mission is to support do-
mestic jobs by facilitating the export of
goods or services when private sector lenders
are unable or unwilling to provide financing.
Foreign governments have established 113

quorum, and raise Ex-Im’s lending authority
to ensure that it can compete globally.
H.R. 4863 includes several additional provi-
sions, including restrictions that would en-
sure that Ex-Im financing follows strict new
rules to prevent financing for the Chinese
army and intelligence services, sanctioned
entities, and known violators of anti-bribery
and intellectual property laws.
U.S. exporters and the hundreds of thou-
sands of jobs that they support need long-

Ex-Im through short-term continuing resolu-
tions is not enough. The Chamber urges you
to support H.R. 4863.

AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION,
Arlington, VA, October 29, 2019.
Hon. MAXINE WATERS,
Chairwoman, House Committee on Financial
Services, Washington, DC.
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY,
Ranking Member, House Committee on Finan-
cial Services, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS AND RANKING
MEMBER MCHENRY: On behalf of the nearly
340 member companies of the Aerospace In-
dustries Association (AIA), we urge you to
reauthorize the Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank
before the November 21 deadline. A fully
functioning Ex-Im Bank is vital to aerospace
and other industries.
The U.S. aerospace and defense industry
supports more than 2.5 million American
jobs, thousands of which have been supported
by Ex-Im Bank financing solutions that fa-
cilitate the export of American goods and
services. Moreover, the Bank is essential for
businesses of all sizes, as more than 90 per-
cent of the Bank’s transactions in FY2019 di-
rectly supported American small businesses.
This is done at no cost to the U.S. taxpayer.
In fact, in 2014 (the last entire year the Bank
was fully operational), the Bank paid $1 bil-
lion into the U.S. Treasury, generated from
the interest paid on loans and the fees from
the Bank’s foreign customers.
Ultimately, the Ex-Im Bank levels the
playing field against foreign competitors in
increasingly competitive international mar-
kets. Key competing nations view aerospace
as critical for their economic growth and se-
curity interests and are increasing invest-
ments in their respective domestic aerospace
industries. These countries are using their
export credit agencies (ECAs) to increase
foreign sales and thus gain advantage in the
market. U.S. industries are up against more
than 110 foreign ECAs in an increasingly
competitive export market. Without the
Bank, we’re giving foreign powers the advan-
tage—the Bank is a necessary equalizer.
We overwhelmingly support moving for-
ward with Ex-Im legislation that will pass
both the House and Senate. This legislation
must include key principles, including long-
term reauthorization, an increase in the au-
thorization ceiling, and a quorum fix.
We look forward to working with you on
Ex-Im reauthorization and ensuring that our
industry remains economically competitive
globally.
Sincerely,
TIM MCCLEES,
Vice President, Legis-
lative Affairs, Aero-
space Industries As-
sociation.
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE
WORKERS,
Upper Marlboro, MD, October 28, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers (IAM), the largest aero-
space manufacturing union in North Amer-
ica, I strongly urge you as a member of the
House Financial Services Committee to sup-
port this vital legislation and vote ‘‘Yes’’ to
advance the United States Export Finance
Agency Act of 2019. This legislation would
create and sustain U.S. jobs in manufac-
turing and other strategic industries and im-
prove the balance of trade between the U.S.
and high export nations by reauthorizing the
Export-Import Bank for the next ten years.
The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is
one of the few U.S. institutions that actually
supports U.S. exports and jobs by providing
vital loan guarantees for the sale of U.S.
goods and services to international markets.
This legislation would rename the Ex-IM
Bank to the United States Export Finance
Agency, but its mission would remain the
same, ‘‘to assist in financing the export of
U.S. goods and services’’, enabling ‘‘large
and small companies to turn export opportu-
nities into real sales that help to maintain
and create U.S. jobs and contribute to a
stronger national economy.’’ With the banks
authorizing charter set to expire in Novem-
ber 2019, it is imperative that Congress work
expeditiously to pass this Ex-IM Bank reau-
thorization legislation before the bank’s
charter lapses.
American jobs depend upon a fully func-
tioning Ex-Im Bank with a fully staffed
board of directors to provide vital financing
for the export of U.S. made products. Under
the Bank’s current charter projects which
require more than $10 million in financing
must be approved by the Ex-IM Bank board
of directors. However, the lack of a quorum
on the board in recent years has crippled the
Ex-Im Bank’s ability to support U.S. manu-
facturers and workers, particularly in the
aerospace industry, one of the last sectors in
which the U.S. enjoys a positive balance of
trade with the rest of the world. According
to the bank’s most recent annual report, the
Ex-Im Bank authorized only $3.3 billion in
export credit in FY 2018. This is down from
$20 billion in authorized export credit in FY
2014, which was the last year the bank was
fully operational with a fully staffed board.
Consequently, the bank estimates that it
supported a mere 33,000 U.S. jobs in FY 2018,
a fraction of the 164,000 American jobs that
the bank supported in FY 2014 when it oper-
ated with a full quorum. Meanwhile, job pro-
ducing export projects are being taken by
foreign competitors. Our international com-
petitors continue to support their companies
through comprehensive industrial policies in
addition to robust export financing agencies.
China alone has three export credit agencies
that dwarf what our Ex-Im Bank provides.
The proposed legislation not only reau-
thorizes the Ex-IM bank over the next ten
years, but it includes important provisions
to reform the bank’s quorum rules which
have severely limited the banks effectiveness
in recent years. The bill provides for a proc-
ess to seat a temporary board if a quorum
cannot be reached over a 90 day period. In
addition to these needed reforms to the
quorum rules, this legislation would gradu-
ally increase the Ex-Im Bank’s lending au-
thority from $135 billion to $175 billion, al-
lowing the bank to expand its portfolio of
projects, increase U.S. exports, create addi-
tional U.S. jobs, and drive economic growth.
For all of these reasons, I urge all members
of the House Financial Services Committee
to support this vitally important legislation
and vote ‘‘Yes’’ in favor of passage of The
United States Export Finance Agency Act of
2019.
For more information, please contact IAM
Legislative Director.
Thank you,
ROBERT MARTINEZ, JR.,
International President.
AFL–CIO,
Washington, DC, November 13, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
AFL-CIO, I write to express our strong sup-
port for the ‘‘United States Export Finance
Agency Act of 2019’’ (H.R. 4863) scheduled for
floor consideration this week.
A healthy Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im
Bank) is pivotal to the creation and sustain-
ability of U.S. jobs in manufacturing, as well
as increasing U.S. exports, thereby improv-
ing the balance of trade between the U.S.
and high export countries.
H.R. 4863 reauthorizes the Ex-Im Bank for
the next ten years and would gradually in-
crease the bank’s lending authority by $40
billion, resulting in an expansion of projects.
Although the bill would rename the Ex-Im
Bank as the ‘‘United States Export Finance
Agency,’’ its intended mission ‘‘to assist in
financing the export of U.S. goods and serv-
ices’’ would remain unchanged. The legisla-
tion also includes provisions that reform the
Bank’s quorum rules that have severely lim-
ited the Bank’s viability in recent years.
The creation of U.S. jobs is essential to a
strong economy, and with the Bank’s author-
izing charter set to expire in later this
month, now is the time to pass this impor-
tant piece of legislation. For the reasons
stated above, we urge you to vote for the im-
mediate passage of H.R. 4863.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM SAMUEL,
Director,
Government Affairs.
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF PRO-
FESSIONAL & TECHNICAL ENGI-
NEERS,
Washington, DC, November 12, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: As the executive
officers of the International Federation of
Professional & Technical Engineers (IFPTE),
representing upwards of 90,000 workers, we
urge you to vote to reauthorize the Export-
Import Bank by passing H.R. 4863. ‘‘United
States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019.’’
This legislation supports American jobs in
strategic industries and sectors of the U.S.
economy, helps domestic manufacturing
compete with manufacturers in high export
nations. and takes steps to maintain the Ex-
port-Import Bank’s (EXIM) operations over
the next ten years.
EXIM is a critical tool that promotes U.S.
manufacturing exports, from the primary ex-
porter down through the domestic supply
chain and requires at least 85% domestic
content for full financing support. Among
the U.S. workers that have benefited from
EXIM are IFPTE members working at Boe-
ing. Spirit AeroSystems. and Triumph Com-
posite Systems. EXIM’s financing for com-
mercial airplane exports not only supports
high-paying jobs and strategic sectors of the
economy but also helps reduce the U.S. trade
deficit. and provides financing for diverse in-
dustries, including small- and medium-sized
business. consumable and durable goods ex-
porters, and services exporters. The
ExportImport Bank also results in a reduc-
tion of our national debt. as it has proven
itself to be a federal agency that added $9.6
billion in revenue to our national budget
since 1992.
Emerging national economies have aggres-
sively expanded their export financing agen-
cies and Organization for Economic Coopera-
tion & Development (OECD) nations con-
tinue their export credit support, making it
critically important for Congress to respond
by reauthorizing EXIM before its current au-
thorization expires after November 21. Chi-
na’s two export credit agencies totaled $39
billion in new medium- to long-term export

South Korea) combined authorizations. By
comparison, EXIM committed just $300 mil-
lion in medium- to long-term export credits
for 2018 with all financial authorizations for
the year totaling $3.3 billion. EXIM’s finan-
cial authorizations have ranked near the
bottom of OECD nations and emerging na-
tional economies over the last three years
due to EXIM lacking a quorum for its Board
from mid-2015 to May 2019, leaving it unable
to approve transactions exceeding $10 mil-
lion during that time. The three-year back-
log of transactions in the EXIM pipeline to-
tals $40 billion and is estimated by EXIM to
support 240,000 jobs.
IFPTE supports this legislation as well as
the Senate bill sponsored by Senator Kevin
Cramer, S. 2293, because it includes straight-
forward measures to reform EXIM’s quorum
rules so that EXIM’s ability to support
American exports and jobs cannot be limited
by political gridlock, reauthorizes EXIM for
ten years. and gradually increases EXIM’s
exposure cap from $135 billion to $175 billion
over seven years. These provisions will cre-
ate stability and room for EXIM’s financing
ability to grow its portfolio of projects, sup-
port U.S. exports and jobs. and drive eco-
nomic growth.
For these reasons, we urge you to vote for
the ‘‘United States Export Finance Agency
Act of 2019.’’ Thank you for your consider-
ation. Should you have any questions. please
feel free to contact either of us or IFPTE
legislative representative.

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
MANUFACTURERS,
November 14, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: Following strong
growth and job creation over the past several
years, manufacturers in America are now
facing global economic headwinds and grap-
pling with uncertainty in trade policy. If
this uncertainty is allowed to persist, Amer-
ica will feel the consequences of reduced de-
mand, production and employment in the
manufacturing industry. That is why the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers urges
you to act now to help reverse this trend by
supporting H.R. 4863, the United States Ex-
port Finance Agency Act, which provides a
long-term reauthorization of the U.S. Ex-
port-Import Bank that will enable manufac-
turers to export more of our products, invest
more in our communities and hire more
American workers.
H.R. 4863 will provide the tools that manu-
facturers need to compete in the global econ-
omy. More than 100 foreign export credit
agencies around the world are actively help-
ing their manufacturers win sales and jobs.
Failing to reauthorize the bank is akin to
unilateral disarmament. The Ex-Im Bank
fills the gaps when the private sector is un-
able or unwilling to finance or provide other
tools needed to participate in foreign
projects or make export sales. Since 2000, the
Ex-Im Bank has facilitated nearly $450 bil-
lion in exports from thousands of U.S. com-
panies-with more than 90% of its trans-
actions directly supporting small businesses-
and supported more than 2.5 million Amer-
ican jobs.
In the decade following the Great Reces-
sion, countries have prioritized exports, lead-
ing to a substantial increase in global export
credit financing. China is the most aggres-
sive nation, using export credit to expand its
influence around the globe. Chinese pro-
grams are opaque and unregulated, with esti-
mates that China provided more than $500
billion in export credit in 2018, more support
than all G7 export credit agencies combined.
To counter China and remain competitive,
manufacturers in the United States need
H.R. 4863. It includes a 10-year reauthoriza-
tion, an increase in the authorization ceiling
and measures to ensure that the agency’s
board of directors will remain fully func-
tioning for the length of the reauthorization.
The USEFAA also includes important re-
forms to prevent the misuse of Ex-Im Bank
financing by entities connected to the Chi-
nese People’s Liberation Army or other sanc-
tioned entities involved in corruption, intel-
lectual property theft and other activities
that threaten U.S. security. At the same
time, this legislation will enable manufac-
turers in the United States to compete with
China everywhere, outside and inside China.
The USEFAA is a win for American manu-
facturing workers. It will level the playing
field, help manufacturers win sales and set
an example of the values we are proud to rep-
resent on the global stage. Manufacturers
urge your support for H.R. 4863 and ask that
you reject amendments that would under-
mine this robust reauthorization and the
ability of the agency to enable manufactur-
ers to compete effectively around the world.
Sincerely,
JAY TIMMONS.
THE BOEING COMPANY,
Arlington, VA, October 28, 2019.
Hon. MAXINE WATERS,
Chairwoman, House Committee on Financial
Services, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS, The Boeing
Company values your commitment to Amer-
ican manufacturing and job growth. As you
know well, American workers create some of
the best products and services in the world.
When we are able to compete on a level play-
ing field, we are able to create good-paying
jobs by selling those products around the
globe.
We write today to express our strong sup-
port for your legislation, the United States
Export Finance Agency Act of 2019, which
would provide a long-term reauthorization
for the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im).
A full, long-term reauthorization of the
Ex-Im Bank is critical to stabilizing and
strengthening America’s economic capa-
bility in this current, unstable global mar-
ket. Manufacturers and businesses that in-
vest in equipment and other building mate-
rials would be greatly empowered by the sta-
bility brought by your legislation’s 10 year
reauthorization of the Ex-Im charter.
We also strongly support the permanent fix
to the quorum requirements for larger deals.
as well as the increase in cap thresholds,
bringing the policies of Ex-Im in line with
the modern challenges our American work-
ers and businesses face in the global market-
place today.
During the last eight years, Ex-Im has sup-
ported more than 1.4 million U.S. jobs. In
2018 alone, the Ex-Im Bank helped more than
2,100 small businesses export their products.
These impressive data points don’t include
the countless other supply chain companies
who do business with larger U.S. exporters
who also use Ex-Im financing.
Ex-Im is a tremendous asset to American
businesses. We support your leadership in au-
thoring the United States Export Finance
Agency Act and urge all members of the
House Financial Services Committee to vote
in favor of its passage.
Sincerely,
TIM KEATING,
Executive Vice Presi-
dent, Government
Operations, The

AIR TRACTOR INC.,
Olney, TX, October 28, 2019.
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, Chair,
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY, Ranking Minority
Member,
House Committee on Financial Services,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN WATERS AND RANKING
MEMBER MCHENRY: It is my understanding
that your committee will consider mark up
tomorrow of which one consideration is reau-
thorization of the Export-Import Bank
(United States Export Finance Agency of
2019). I have communicated to you before on
how important the Export-Import Bank
(‘‘Ex-Im’’) is to Air Tractor, a small business
manufacturer and exporter. Ex-Im allows us
to create and sustain jobs in rural north
Texas. There is no substitute for Ex-Im and
its products. Ex-Im is very important to
small business and in my opinion, to all ex-
porters large and small. Ex-Im means U.S.
jobs.
I would urge swift and bipartisan action
tomorrow to advance this legislation as cur-
rently proposed. The U.S. needs a robust and
long-term reauthorization of Ex-Im.
If you have any questions of me, please
contact me.
Sincerely,
DAVID ICKERT,
Treasurer and CFO.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN).
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Chair, I thank Chair-
woman WATERS and Representative
HECK for this important legislation.
I am excited to stand here in support
of the Export-Import Bank. It is criti-
cally important to my home State of
Pennsylvania and, in particular, my
home district of Montgomery County
and Berks County.
With over 200 total exporters in
Pennsylvania, which have contributed
over $4 billion in total export value
from 2014 to 2019, the Export-Import
Bank has helped businesses across the
Commonwealth gain access to new
markets, create jobs, and compete
globally.
That is why I am pleased to be
among the original cosponsors and sup-
porters of H.R. 4863, the United States
Export Finance Agency Act, which re-
authorizes the Bank for 10 years and
makes critical reforms to help busi-
nesses across our Nation.
In particular, this reauthorization
bill increases the Bank’s lending au-
thority to $175 billion, includes a
quorum fix, and enhances the Bank’s
environmental practices. Importantly,
it also establishes an Office of Minority
and Women Inclusion and an Office of
Territorial Exporting, two important
provisions that will help diversify the
Bank’s activities and our global activi-
ties.
Finally, the bill has key endorse-
ments, as the chairwoman has so elo-
quently listed, from various industry
stakeholders, including labor and the
business community.
Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman
WATERS and Representative HECK for
introducing this reauthorization bill,
and I urge adoption of the bill.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I continue
to reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8853
November 14, 2019
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, it is my
pleasure to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER),
the distinguished majority leader and a
longtime supporter of Ex-Im.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chairwoman for yielding.
And I thank Mr. MCHENRY for his
work on the committee. Mr. Chair, I
say to Mr. MCHENRY: There is still
time to get well.
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of
this legislation. I have been the major-
ity leader in years past, the minority
whip in years past, and now again the
majority leader. During all of those
years, I have been a strong supporter of
the Ex-Im Bank.
Mr. Cantor, who was the majority
leader, and I worked together the last
time we brought this bill to the floor
for reauthorization. There were 42 Re-
publicans, many of whom served on the
Financial Services Committee, who
signed a discharge petition, a Repub-
lican discharge petition, because the
chairman of the committee refused to
bring this bill to the floor.
b 1500
Mr. Chair, this bill enjoys the sup-
port of the United States Chamber of
Commerce, wide support among the
business community throughout Amer-
ica, support of the labor movement—
the AFL–CIO and labor unions—all
over America, and the support of mil-
lions of workers who are producing
products here in America.
I have an agenda. I call it Make It In
America. This is critical to that be-
cause all of our competitors around the
world have an agency similar to the
Export-Import Bank that facilitates
their products being sold in competi-
tion with ours.
If we fail to reauthorize this piece of
legislation, and if we fail to effect the
reforms that have been included in not
only dealing with the amount of money
that they are authorized to lend but
also the fact that we will not be locked
into the inability of either a President
or a Senate to confirm members of the
Ex-Im board, but we will be able to act.
This legislation, therefore, is better
than we have done before.
I thank MAXINE WATERS for her
untiring leadership on this issue, and I
also congratulate my friend DENNY
HECK, a member of the committee from
Washington State who has been as te-
nacious and faithful in his support of
ensuring the reauthorization when we
had the discharge petition, and this
time, as anybody in this House. I thank
the gentleman, Mr. HECK, for his lead-
ership on this issue.
When that bill was discharged, some
of you may remember, even though the
Republican leadership would not bring
it to the floor, it had to be discharged.
Forty-two Republicans signed the dis-
charge petition, led by Mr. LUCAS and
Mr. Fincher from Tennessee.
Mr. LUCAS is still here. I hope Mr.
LUCAS will vote for this bill when he
has the opportunity to do so one more
time.
I had made the point with Mr. Cantor
that I believed that the majority of Re-
publicans would support the reauthor-
ization. And, in fact, they did. The ma-
jority of Republicans, when the vote
came, voted for the bill that had been
refused by Mr. Hensarling to bring it to
the floor.
So this is not as if it is some partisan
piece of legislation. I would hope the
Republicans would have the courage—
although I see them too often march-
ing in lockstep to their party principle
rather than their own principle. I am
disappointed with that, Mr. Chair, be-
cause this is a piece of legislation that
will protect and create hundreds of
thousands of jobs and because it will
make us more competitive.
We make some of the best products
in the world, period. But we need to be
price competitive because people will
be inclined to buy, perhaps, a less qual-
ity product because it is cheaper.
That is why the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce is overwhelmingly in sup-
port of this. That is why the adminis-
tration is in favor of reauthorizing the
Ex-Im Bank.
They say they want it clean. The
President was initially, during the
course of his campaign, opposed to the
Ex-Im Bank. Then he talked, frankly,
to some people in manufacturing who
said: Mr. President, if we don’t have an
Export-Import Bank, you said you
want to create jobs, but you are going
to lose jobs.
So he changed his mind. Then, unfor-
tunately, he appointed somebody to
head up the Ex-Im Bank who was to-
tally against it, a guy named Scott
Garrett from New Jersey. The good
news is the Senate said, because it sup-
ports the Ex-Im Bank, they are not
going to take Garrett, so his name was
withdrawn.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate Chairwoman
WATERS for bringing this to the floor. I
urge every Member of this body to sup-
port it. Don’t snatch partisanship from
the jaws of bipartisanship every time
you get the opportunity.
Let’s try to reflect to the American
people that business and labor are to-
gether, and, yes, even Democrats and
Republicans, conservatives and lib-
erals, are together because this is good
for American jobs. It is good for people
who want to make it in America.
That is what Ms. WATERS, the chair
of the committee, has been arguing,
and Mr. HECK, and GWEN MOORE, who
chaired the subcommittee when we
took it out last time, and others who
have fought so hard for this bill.
Our economy depends on strong ex-
port growth, not just for large busi-
nesses, but small and medium-sized
businesses in communities across the
country. It is not just the exporter. It
is all the secondary small businesses
that provide products for those large
exporters.
For this reason, the Export-Import
Bank has traditionally had strong, bi-
partisan support. A majority of Repub-
licans just a few years ago supported
this bill. Not this exact bill. This bill
should have that kind of support, too.
There is not a single provision in this
bill that those on the other side of the
aisle can legitimately label a poison
pill. That doesn’t mean it is exactly
like they want it. We don’t always get
everything we want. But the central
part of this bill ought to be supported
by every one of us.
The last time this came up, one Dem-
ocrat voted against it. He is no longer
with us—not because of his vote on this
bill. But I point out to you that we are
overwhelmingly for this bill. Business
wants this bill.
Usually, you don’t see the Democrats
saying yes to business groups. This is
for jobs for working Americans. That is
why this bill has the strong and unified
support of the business community.
I am disappointed, frankly, that Re-
publicans have decided to make this
bill partisan. Frankly, Mr. MCCARTHY
was for this bill before he was against
this bill—not this bill. He was for the
Export-Import Bank before he was
against it, if you look at the RECORD.
He is going to vote against it this time.
Mr. SCALISE voted against it last
time, as did Mr. MCCARTHY on the re-
authorization that I just mentioned
that was discharged out of committee,
as did Mr. MCHENRY. All three of them
opposed this bill in the past.
So it is not a question of these
amendments. For whatever reasons,
they are opposed to this bill. That is a
shame. There is no reason for sup-
porters of American exports on both
sides of the aisle not to come together
and support the Ex-Im Bank’s reau-
thorization.
My hope is that what this House will
do today is send a strong message of
support for the Export-Import Bank.
Tell the rest of the world we are going
to compete. Tell the rest of the world
we are going to compete on an even
playing field. Tell the rest of the world
we are going to support our exporting
community.
Indeed, according to the National As-
sociation of Manufacturers, during the
4-year period from 2015 to 2019 when the
Ex-Im Bank lacked a quorum needed to
do its job properly, our country gained
80,000 fewer manufacturing jobs and
lost $119 billion in manufacturing out-
put, all because we didn’t fix the
quorum, which is now fixed in this bill.
Let me repeat that: 80,000 fewer manu-
facturing jobs and $119 billion in lost
output.
This fixes that. If you vote against
this bill, you may be voting against
$119 billion—probably more because of
inflation, maybe $150 billion—to the
good. Not government spending, in-
creased output, increased economic ac-
tivity, and increased jobs of 80,000,
probably more.
Countries all around the world have
export credit agencies, as I have said.
In fact, China has three export credit
agencies that provided more support in
just 1 year than the Export-Import
Bank has provided in its entire history.

What do you say by a ‘‘no’’ vote? We
are going to retreat from that competi-
tion. We are not going to play. Who
does that advantage? China. Who does
that advantage? Every one of our other
competitors. Who does that disadvan-
tage? American workers.
Mr. Chair, we need to give our ex-
porters a fair, fighting chance by pro-
viding export financing to American
business. That is what this bill does.
It is not a partisan bill. It is not a
Republican bill or a Democratic bill.
Those of you who say you are
probusiness and proworker and want to
build jobs, that is why the President of
the United States decided he is for re-
authorization. He may not like a provi-
sion or two in this bill, but the admin-
istration says they are for reauthor-
izing this.
This gives you the opportunity to do
that. Take it. This is not going to be a
partisan bill for any of us. Take this
opportunity to stand up as the major-
ity of your colleagues did the last time
this reauthorization came to the floor,
and as they have done every time it
has come to the floor.
Join me, my colleagues, in voting for
American workers, American manufac-
turers, suppliers, subcontractors, little
businesses, small businesses, and me-
dium businesses. This is good for Amer-
ica. Vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I would assure my colleagues that
when the President says that he is
going to veto the bill, as he put out
with a Statement of Administration
Policy, he intends to veto this bill if it
hits his desk. That is number one.
Two, the Senate majority leader
says: ‘‘We are not going to pass the
House bill.’’
They also say they are going to take
this up as a part of the CR, and I think
that is important. We don’t want this
Bank to lapse.
I would also commend for my col-
leagues that—it is a bit rich, a bit
thick, because people voted for Ex-Im
and against Ex-Im in the past, includ-
ing Chairwoman WATERS, who voted
against reauthorization in 2002. So
times change, issues change, and our
votes reflect those changes in time.
I would say that the majority leader,
in his speech, does outline that he is a
strong advocate for the Bank. He abso-
lutely is. That is why I have great as-
surance when this bill passes or doesn’t
pass that we will have an extension of
the Bank, and we are going to have a
functioning bank. It is important.
Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STIVERS),
the ranking member of the Sub-
committee on National Security, Inter-
national Development and Monetary
Policy, a great advocate for the Ex-Im
Bank, to talk through his position on
Ex-Im.
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, I thank the
ranking member for yielding.
I don’t want to fall into revisionist
history. I was one of the Republicans
who signed the discharge petition
against my own chairman and against
my own leadership in 2014 and sup-
ported the Ex-Im Bank.
I would love to be here this afternoon
to be supporting a bipartisan bill on re-
authorizing the Ex-Im Bank. We had a
bipartisan bill in June, and it wasn’t
the Republicans who walked away from
it. It was the Democratic majority that
walked away from it. The bill was
marked up on a party-line vote in the
Financial Services Committee.
I think it is really important to note
that we will reauthorize the Export-
Import Bank in the appropriations
process, and many of us support that.
We do not want a lapse. But this bill is
going to the Senate where it goes no-
where. And the administration has said
they would veto it.
Let’s not pursue a partisan vehicle
here. The Rules Committee had an op-
portunity to allow for some amend-
ments that would have addressed some
very important issues, including one
from my colleague from Arkansas (Mr.
HILL) that would have stopped China
from stealing intellectual property.
They chose to block consideration of
those amendments.
Ex-Im reauthorization is now, unfor-
tunately, tied to the appropriations
process, and I think we all know that.
I want to reiterate that my fear is
that we are needlessly moving forward
with a party-line vote, or a mostly
party-line vote, on something that has
and should be bipartisan.
b 1515
Finally, I want to address some com-
ments made earlier by one of my col-
leagues expressing skepticism about
the ranking member, Mr. MCHENRY’s
willingness to back the reauthorization
effort.
We all know that the ranking mem-
ber reached a deal with the chair-
woman in June on reauthorization,
and, again, it was the Democratic ma-
jority that walked away from it, not
the ranking member. I just want to
make sure everybody understood that
that was what happened.
Furthermore, the deal actually in-
creased Ex-Im’s lending cap up to $175
billion, something that I know our
former chairman would have never
done. So I think our ranking member
has dealt in good faith through this
whole process. I also think it is com-
pletely inaccurate that they didn’t deal
in good faith.
Regardless of what happens today, I
am hopeful that we will find a way to
reauthorize the Export-Import Bank,
and I now know it is definitely tied to
the appropriations process.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader,
to respond to anything he would like to
respond to.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, by the way, Mr. MCHENRY
is my friend. He and I have a good
working relationship, and I appreciate
that friendship. I regret that he is op-
posing this bill. I know there was an
attempt to reach a bipartisan agree-
ment.
In candor, I think everybody on this
floor needs to know there were outside
business concerns about that agree-
ment, so it was not simply a partisan
act. It was that those who see this as a
job creator thought that some of the
provisions that were put in the so-
called compromise would be harmful to
job creation and to the sale of exports
across the sea.
But the reason I really rose—and I
thank Madam Chairwoman for yield-
ing—is to say, yes, the President said
he was going to veto this; yes, the ma-
jority leader in the Senate said he is
not going to bring things up. That is
unfortunate, but the statement I made
is accurate.
The President of the United States
says he is for the reauthorization of
the Export-Import Bank. That is a
change in his position during the
course of his campaign in 2016. It is a
change because he was convinced that
the reauthorization of the Export-Im-
port Bank is good for America, good for
jobs, good for business, good for work-
ing men and women in this country.
And so he has repaired, also, to par-
tisanship.
There are no poison pills in here.
There may be some things you wanted
that are not in this bill; there may be
some things in this bill that I would
have liked that are not in this bill. But
the central point of this is this reau-
thorizes the Bank.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield an
additional 1 minute to the majority
leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman.
It takes care of the challenge that we
had when there was no quorum, and the
fact that we had no quorum was all
about politics.
Don’t make this about politics as
well. An estimate of 80,000 jobs, $150
billion lost because we didn’t have a
quorum. Let’s not twist in the wind.
This bill has 95 percent agreement.
The gentleman who spoke before me
said he voted for this last time. There
is no change that, in my opinion, war-
rants a change in heart.
I know that there is some upset that
the bipartisan bill that was agreed to
didn’t fly, but it didn’t fly mostly be-
cause the outside came in and said:
This will not help us; this will not af-
fect the end that we want. That record
ought to be clear, Mr. Chairman.
So the chairwoman worked on bring-
ing a bill to the floor that will help.
She has done that. I hope my col-
leagues will put their partisanship be-
hind them, put protecting, frankly,
their positioning in terms of negotia-
tion behind them and vote for this bill.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, may I
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing.

Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I
would commend for the House that,
yes, there is an opportunity for biparti-

is an important institution. At its
height, it supported almost 2 percent of
American exports. It is a small amount
of global trade, but it is important. We

my colleague.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, we hear
the President is for the extension, the
Senate is for the extension. The prob-
lem is, they are not for this piece of
legislation.
I think it is important to be able to
note that the ranking member, once
again, on the Committee on Financial
Services had a deal in principle with
the chair to be able to reauthorize the
Bank, to be able to add strong protec-
tions against China’s global interest.
Unfortunately, that deal was pulled,
and we are left with the bill that does
not address these issues head-on.
In the committee’s process, I offered
an amendment to be able to combat
China’s Belt and Road Initiative that
would prohibit Ex-Im’s assistance to
the Government of China unless other-
wise authorized by the President of the
United States.
China’s envisioned the Belt and Road
as an economic tool to be able to ex-
pand their influence and, in some
cases, force countries to become overly
reliant on financing from China.
The Belt and Road projects also raise
a specter of infrastructure that could
be used by China’s military, even as
China promotes international reach
with the yuan and the potential dis-
placement of the dollar.
With more than 60 countries poten-
tially hosting Belt and Road projects
and estimated total financing exceed-
ing $1 trillion, the Chinese Govern-
ment’s ambitions are massive and seri-
ous—and should be taken so.
The Obama administration actively
attempted to be able to keep foreign
countries from joining China in their
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
over concerns that the resources would
support Beijing’s geopolitical ambi-
tions.
The bill on the floor today does noth-
ing to be able to address these issues. If
anything, the Belt and Road Initiative
is even more worrying, and we ought to
take a strong stance against it.
Further, according to the Council on
Foreign Relations, China’s Belt and
Road Initiative is one of the main
planks of China’s statecraft under the
current regime, and it is a key compo-
nent of the Made in China 2025 eco-
nomic development strategy.
And yet, my amendment, in process,
was rejected in committee, and there is
no trace of proactive restraint against
the Belt and Road investments in the
bill on the floor today.
It is completely nonsensical to have
the Export-Import Bank offer U.S. tax-
payer-backed subsidies to companies
implementing projects that further
Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. HECK).
Mr. HECK. Mr. Chair, consistency is
the hobgoblin of small minds, and no-
body is ever going to accuse the other
side of having a small mind, because I
have been here just long enough to re-
member when they railed with right-
eous indignation to pass legislation
even though the Obama administration
had issued an SAP. Evidently, that is
not a standard that applies today, but
it applied then.
Listen, I have heard no objections to
the content of the proposed legislation.
What mostly I have heard is that we
had a deal that fell apart and it is all
our fault. That is pretty good revi-
sionist history. It fell apart because it
didn’t have the votes.
And it wasn’t just a question of what
happened on the majority side. They
know full well there were minority
party Members who were not going to
vote for it. There was bipartisan oppo-
sition, frankly, because of all the ex-
ternal stakeholder opposition, because
it does not work.
What are the differences, the major
differences? Basically, that other deal
would have prohibited sale into coun-
tries—China, in particular—with state-
owned enterprises.
What are those? All railroads, all
utilities, all airlines. That is not the
way we engage other countries and
change their behavior.
Materially, factually wrong that we
would subsidize the Chinese Com-
munist Party. In fact, in the last 30
years, the Export-Import Bank has
transferred up to $10 billion into the
U.S. Treasury.
Listen, I just wish people would have
the courage of their convictions. The
argument seems to be made, and I
think it is a debate worth having, is
should we kick China out of the World
Trade Organization. That is really
what is being said here. Let’s have that
debate.
Looking back, I think it is question-
able that they were admitted without
stronger accountability, and I think we
need stronger accountability.
Mr. Chair, great irony, the bill before
you has incredible advance progress
over current law in terms of account-
ability with China. So, at the end of
the day, here it is: revenue generating,
job generating, American jobs. Vote
‘‘yes.’’
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, this is
what we are trying to not fund for
American taxpayers. We are having
American taxpayer dollars go to sub-
sidize Chinese companies to perpetrate
the violence that is happening in re-
pression of the Chinese people and the
folks in Hong Kong. This is what we
are trying to stop, and their bill does
nothing to stop this type of subsidiza-
tion of our goods, our American tax
dollars going into the harm that is per-
petrated there.
So you can make a nice political case
that you have done something, but in
reality, in terms of legislative text,
you don’t do squat. And that is a huge
problem. That is the reason why there
is opposition over here.
I would also commend to my col-
leagues that every Republican voted
for the bipartisan bill that I negotiated
with Chairwoman WATERS in com-
mittee.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ).
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I
thank Ranking Member MCHENRY for
his leadership on this issue.
Let me start by saying that I fully
support the Export-Import Bank and
recognize the important role that the
Bank plays in supporting businesses
and jobs across my district and State.
This is my first time having the op-
portunity to vote on this and state
that, and I want to state it emphati-
cally.
I appreciate that the majority leader
and Mr. HECK have articulated what
specifically is at issue here. And what
is at issue here is that outside groups
have captured this bill and objected to
every single provision, no matter how
small, dealing with the People’s Repub-
lic of China.
They objected, in particular, to an
amendment that I offered that would
require exporters receiving Ex-Im as-
sistance to certify that they do not
punish their employees for private
communications on issues that China
is so sensitive to, specifically, freedom
in Hong Kong and human rights in
Xinjiang and Tibet—not throwing
China out of the WTO, though I am
very, very happy to have a debate on
that.
But that is not what this was about.
This was about preventing our compa-
nies from censoring their own employ-
ees, domestic employees, on their own
time, in the comfort of their own
home.
Nothing in this amendment would
have affected a company’s policies in
the workplace or its ability to manage
business communications. But when
employees are expressing themselves
on their own time and if they want to
stand by victims of oppression, an Ex-
Im beneficiary wouldn’t have been able
to retaliate against them.
I was disheartened that the majority
would not allow this body to debate
and vote on this commonsense amend-
ment that would have protected the
free speech of American workers.
And a final point, because I have a
feeling that somebody is about to read
back to me what they believe they
know about my district.
We have a wonderful system, and in
our system of government, we rep-
resent our own districts. Okay? We

know our districts better than anybody
else. That is why we are here.
On behalf of northeast Ohio, let me
tell you, China has absolutely deci-
mated our manufacturing sector, and I
am proud to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire how much time I have remaining.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
North Carolina has 30 seconds remain-
ing. The gentlewoman from California
has 3 minutes remaining.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I am pre-
pared to close. May I inquire if there
are further speakers on the other side.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I am pre-
pared to close.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chair, this is a failure of bipar-
tisan policymaking, and this is a sad
day.
I am not angry. I appreciate Chair-
woman WATERS attempting to strike a
bipartisan deal. In fact, we had a deal,
and we filed that bill. It is H.R. 3407
that encouraged Members to sign the
discharge petition so we can actually
support something that was a bipar-
tisan negotiation, not this bill before
us today that doesn’t take on the im-
portant work of banning Chinese state-
owned enterprises from accessing our
export credit agency. That is what this
is about.
So I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’
on this very important measure of
international export activities, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
b 1530
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Earlier this year when the Ex-Im re-
authorization was still in committee,
we entered into good-faith negotiations
with Ranking Member MCHENRY. Un-
fortunately, the China state-owned en-
terprise provision insisted on by the
ranking member came up short and
prevented us from reaching broad bi-
partisan support for the bill.
In fact, his China provision was
roundly rejected in seven different
votes in committee. This provision was
voted down during markup because my
colleagues realized that it would do
more to harm U.S. exporters and U.S.
jobs than help to counter against the
very real problems faced by U.S. ex-
porters competing with China.
There are a number of other provi-
sions in Mr. MCHENRY’s bill that are
unnecessary, even burdensome, and
aimed at diminishing the bank’s abil-
ity to function. In fact, in many ways,
rather than seeking to strengthen and
improve the flexibility of the bank to
meet the challenges faced by U.S. in-
dustry today, the provisions in this bill
put forward by the ranking member
consistently sought to further con-
strain the bank with unnecessary and,
in many cases, new limits and restric-
tions.
What the Republicans don’t say is
that a bipartisan bill in the Senate was
introduced that had none of Mr.
MCHENRY’s problematic provisions.
Then, last week, the President simi-
larly said that he also supported a 10-
year clean reauthorization, which is
odd since the Republicans claimed he
supported Mr. MCHENRY’s hurdles for
the Ex-Im Bank.
I continue to believe that this provi-
sion will hamper Ex-Im’s ability to
support U.S. exporters and American
jobs.
Let me just wrap this up by saying
that this is a significant bill that we
have before this House. This is a bill
that will correct the harm that has
been done to our export agency. This is
a bill that will create more jobs.
This is a bill that has the support of
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, GE,
Boeing, the AFL–CIO, the Inter-
national Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers, the International
Brotherhood of Boilermakers, the
International Brotherhood of Elec-
trical Workers, the International Fed-
eration of Professional and Technical
Engineers, the Business Roundtable,
and North America’s Building Trades
Unions.
So, here we have a bill where we have
people who oppose each other all the
time and have come together because
they know that it is in the best inter-
ests of our country. They know that
they have put us in a position—those
who have been voting against reauthor-
ization—of being noncompetitive with
China and other countries who like to
see us in that weakened position.
This bill is going to bring us out of
that weakened position. This is a bill
that improves upon our ability to pro-
vide export financing. This is a bill
that will create jobs.
This is a bill that recognizes that we
are not manufacturing at the rate that
we should be in this country. And we
are not going to be in that position any
more.
This is a bill that creates jobs in all
of our districts. This is a bill that I
would ask my Members to please sup-
port, and let’s keep America moving
forward with the export-import bill.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The CHAIR. All time for general de-
bate has expired.
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be
considered for amendment under the 5-

cies and procedures;

cies, procedures, guidelines, resources, and sys-
tems established to ensure adequate review and
monitoring of the environmental and social im-
pacts of projects;

tiality of sensitive business information should

tion with potentially impacted communities,
project sponsors, Agency management, and
other relevant parties, a flexible process should

clude a detailed accounting of the activities of
the accountability mechanism for the year cov-
ered by the report and the remedial actions

mechanism, the Agency and relevant parties
should engage in proactive outreach to commu-
nities impacted or potentially impacted by Agen-
cy financing and activities to provide informa-
tion on the existence and availability of the ac-
countability mechanism;
(7) the President of the Agency should, subject
to the approval of the Board of Directors of the
Agency, and consistent with applicable law,
through an open and competitive process, in-
cluding solicitation of input from relevant stake-
holders, appoint a director of the accountability
mechanism, who would be responsible for the
day-to-day operations of the mechanism, and a
panel of not less than 3 experts, including the
director, who would also serve as chair of the

H8860 November 14, 2019
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 16, line 3, strike ‘‘and’’.
Page 16, after line 3, insert the following:
(C) an emphasis on outreach to businesses
that export goods and services that are pro-
duced by Indian tribes and that are made, as-
sembled, or otherwise derived on or from an
Indian tribe’s Indian land (as defined in sec-
tion 2601(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992
(25 U.S.C. 2501(2));

‘‘(D)’’.
Page 17, after line 7, insert the following:
(e) REPORT ON ACTIVITIES SUPPORTING IN-
DIAN TRIBES.—Section 8 of such Act (12
U.S.C. 635g), as amended by the preceding
provisions of this Act, is amended by adding
at the end the following:
‘‘(n) REPORT ON ACTIVITIES SUPPORTING IN-
DIAN TRIBES.—The Agency shall include in
its annual report to Congress under sub-
section (a) a report on the steps taken by the
Agency in the period covered by the report
to increase—
‘‘(1) awareness of the Agency and its serv-
ices available to Indian tribes; and
‘‘(2) the provision of Agency support to
tribal export businesses.’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 695, the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. TORRES) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
My amendment would add language
directing the U.S. Export Finance
Agency to emphasize outreach to Trib-
al businesses, including Alaskan Native
corporations, that export goods and
services.
There is a long history of successful
Federal economic development pro-
grams leaving—leaving—Indian Coun-
try behind.
Ensuring that Tribal businesses are
aware of the services and resources
that the agency provides is absolutely
critical. Companies that increase their
exports are able to raise wages, take on
additional employees, and further in-
vest in their communities.
Increased economic development in
Indian Country means increased eco-
nomic opportunity, which, in turn,
means more self-determination for
Tribes and a greater ability to take
care of their people as sovereign na-
tions.
The U.S. Export Finance Agency has
proven to be an important tool in ex-
panding U.S. exports and creating
American jobs, but we need to ensure
that it is a tool that benefits all Amer-
icans, including Native Americans. And
that is exactly what this amendment
does.
Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim
time in opposition, though I am not op-
posed to the amendment.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman from North Carolina is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, Repub-
licans unanimously voted to support
the Waters-McHenry bipartisan bill to
strengthen the bank and combat Chi-
nese aggression but will not support
this partisan bill.
And, while I am not opposed to the
Torres amendment, I would simply
note that there is a point where addi-
tional reporting requirements and
other mandates can burden agencies to
the point of diminishing returns.
I think it is important, though, that
Ex-Im be focused on American busi-
nesses, especially those in need and
that have great capacity like Tribal
businesses do.
So, it is a good amendment. I support
it.
What I would also mention to this
body is that the negotiation on the
Waters-McHenry bill took the small
business mandate for the bank and
raised it so that Ex-Im would make
small businesses more of a priority for
this reauthorization than it previously
had been; and, instead, we have a bill
before us today that delays that raise
for 10 years, until the last year of the
authorization of the bill before us.
I think this is a missed opportunity.
It is bad for small business, bad for
Tribal export businesses, which would
qualify as a small business, most of
them—almost all of them, in fact—
under the purview of the Ex-Im Bank
and the designation of Ex-Im Bank.
So that small business mandate
shows that that was not a priority for
the Democrats who wrote this bill. And
that is a sad thing. It is a bad thing. It
is not helpful to American business and
not helpful to the bank.
Mr. Chair, I support the Torres
amendment, the Torres-Cole amend-
ment, commend the gentlewoman for
offering it, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Chairman, I thank the ranking member
for his support. There has been a lot of
talk around China and zero talk around
Indian Country.
All this amendment does is require
the agency to conduct outreach—out-
reach—to Indian Country to ensure
that Tribal export businesses benefit
from the same services and resources
we offer every other American busi-
ness.
Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. TORRES).
The amendment was agreed to.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
As the new Export Finance Agency
works to help American businesses ex-
port their products and services, it is
critical that we ensure that we are not
enriching or empowering the bad ac-
tors, especially those involved in drug
trafficking, corruption, or human
rights violations.
We don’t want to help those whose
actions are contrary to our American
values, and we certainly don’t want to
help those who act against our best in-
terests.
That is why H.R. 4863 prohibits the
Export Finance Agency from doing
business with individuals who are sub-
ject to U.S. sanctions.
I have offered an amendment to fur-
ther clarify that this prohibition also
extends to individuals who are subject
to sanctions related to human rights
and violations of free speech. This is
especially important given the growing
challenges to free speech across the
world, including in Hong Kong and in
Xinjiang.
Government officials or other enti-
ties who are involved in the suppres-
sion of free speech should not benefit
from the agency’s investment, and all
of us should agree to that.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I seek
time in opposition, but I am not op-
posed to the amendment.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman from North Carolina is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, let me say
this: Republicans unanimously voted
to support the Waters-McHenry bipar-
tisan deal in committee to strengthen
and combat Chinese aggression, but we
are not going to support this partisan
bill that is before us.
This amendment, in my view, is a
very simple one. It is a restatement of

existing law. You cannot do business
with sanctioned individuals. American
businesses cannot do business with
sanctioned individuals or entities. It is
American law.
So, if American businesses can’t do
business with sanctioned entities, what
this amendment says is they also can-
not get subsidized by the Ex-Im Bank
to do that business that they can’t do.
So, fine. I don’t oppose the amend-
ment, but what this looks like to me is
cover to Democrats for gutting impor-
tant national security provisions in the
Waters-McHenry bipartisan Ex-Im re-
authorization bill.
In that legislation, Republicans
sought to restrict Ex-Im assistance for
Chinese government-controlled entities
in light of Beijing’s suppression of free-
dom of speech, freedom in Hong Kong,
its political repression of religious and
ethnic minorities, and other actions in-
consistent with our national interests.
Rather than support those provi-
sions, Democrats have decided to par-
rot China, this China language, and,
well, quite frankly, take Republicans’
intellectual property here and talking
points, if you will, and try to cover it.
And that is what this amendment is.
So, American businesses cannot do
business with sanctioned entities.
What this says is that they also can’t
get Ex-Im financing for the business
that they can’t do.
Fine. Great. Fine. We will let it go. It
is fine. But, news flash to anyone: You
can’t finance something that doesn’t
actually happen.
So this amendment, it is fine. It
checks the box, covers a little political
cover. I got it. It is fine. So we will just
let it go, but that is really what this
does. It is a political cover vote rather
than actually anything of substance.
So I will let it go. I will let it go by a
voice vote.
But I think what will happen is that
the Democrat majority will call a roll-
call vote so their Members can show
they have a vote to do something that
gives them political cover. It is good. It
is great. It is fine. But I am not going
to participate in that charade.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. TORRES of California. I take
issue with the ranking member ques-
tioning my hard work. I have spent
every year since I came to Congress in
2015 working to address the issues of
public corruption in Central America
and throughout Latin America. So for
this to come up now is, frankly, very
disappointing.
My amendment, yes, does build on
important provisions that are already
in the bill, which prohibit extending
credit to individuals who are subject to
U.S. sanctions.
These provisions will protect the new
agency, uphold American values, and
protect our national security.
I urge my colleagues to find a way to
see through this fog and understand
that this is the right way to go about
it. I hope they will support the bill and
support my amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
b 1545
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Again, let me state this: If you are a
sanctioned individual or entity, under
American law, American businesses
cannot do business with them.
We have an amendment here that
says they also can’t get subsidized fi-
nancing from Ex-Im to do that business
that they are prevented from doing.
Okay, fine. I get this. It has language
about human rights, but we already
have that limitation in law, in fact. If
we wanted to do something real and
substantive when it comes to sanc-
tioned individuals, we would have gone
a step further, including the China pro-
visions in the bipartisan Waters-
McHenry bill.
All this does is restate existing law.
It is not a good amendment. It is not a
bad amendment. It is a political cover
amendment. It is a sad thing that, in-
stead of doing things of substance and
having real impact, we are doing this.
So, fine. Vote for it. Add it to the
bill. It doesn’t matter. The bill is not
going to become law.
We are restating existing policy here,
existing law. American businesses can-
not do business with sanctioned enti-
ties. If they do, they become poten-
tially sanctioned under American law.
We have a provision of law already for
this. Now you are saying Ex-Im can’t
finance something that can’t happen.
Okay, fine.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

House Report 116–289.
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I offer
an amendment as the designee of Mr.

The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-

Page 21, strike line 17 and all that follows
through page 30, line 9, and insert the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 13. PROMOTING AFFORDABLE ENERGY, EN-
ERGY EFFICIENCY, AND CLEAN EN-
ERGY EXPORTS.
(a) OFFICE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND
CLEAN ENERGY EXPORTS.—Section 2(b)(1)(C)
of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12
U.S.C. 635(b)(1)(C)) is amended to read as fol-
lows:
‘‘(C) OFFICE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND
CLEAN ENERGY EXPORTS.—The President of
the Agency shall establish an office whose
functions shall be to—
‘‘(i) advise the Board of Directions on ways
of promoting the export of goods and serv-
ices to be used in the development, produc-
tion, and distribution of energy efficiency
and clean energy resources;
‘‘(ii) disseminate information concerning
export opportunities and the availability of
Agency support for such activities; and
‘‘(iii) act as a liaison between the Agency
and the Department of Commerce and other
appropriate departments and agencies of the
Federal Government.’’.
(b) AFFORDABLE ENERGY.—Section 11(a) of
such Act (12 U.S.C. 635i–5(a)) is amended—
(1) by redesignating paragraph (2) as para-
graph (3) and inserting after paragraph (1)
the following:
‘‘(2) AFFORDABILITY OF ENERGY CONSIDER-
ATION.—The Agency shall establish proce-
dures to consider, concurrently with compli-
ance with the procedures established under
paragraph (1), potential increases to energy
prices resulting from the export of any good
or service supported by the Agency.’’; and
(2) in paragraph (3) (as so redesignated)—

amended to read as follows:
‘‘(c) INCLUSION IN ANNUAL REPORT TO CON-
GRESS.—The Agency shall include in its an-
nual report to Congress under section 8 a re-
port on the following:
‘‘(1) Whether the provision by the Agency
of financing for the goods and services de-
scribed in section 2(b)(1)(C)(i) have increased
energy affordability in the countries to
which the goods and services have been ex-
ported.
‘‘(2) An estimate of any reductions in emis-

by the Agency of financing for the goods and
services referred to in paragraph (1) of this
subsection.’’.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Texas.
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, again, I
am offering this amendment on behalf
of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS).
This amendment requires the Export-
Import Bank to take into consider-
ation energy affordability, in addition
to environmental impact, before ap-
proving transactions. It further re-
quires the Export-Import Bank to re-
port on how transactions impact the
cost of energy in the importing coun-
try and the estimated emissions reduc-
tions caused by Bank-financed exports.
Clean energy sources from nonrenew-
able sources, such as hydrogen, nu-
clear, and natural gas, are just as im-
portant to lowering emissions as re-
newable energy. The bill, as written,
only focuses on renewable energy
sources, but we should also promote
nonrenewable clean energy sources
such as nuclear, hydrogen, and natural
gas.

H8862 November 14, 2019
If emissions reductions are the goal,
Federal policies must focus on total
performance and not favor one tech-
nology over the other. In the devel-
oping world, affordable, clean energy
will give people more opportunity for a
better life when expensive alternatives
are unaffordable.
I urge passage of this amendment to
ensure that energy affordability, en-
ergy efficiency, and clean energy re-
main an important component of our
export policy.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I seek to claim the time in oppo-
sition.
The CHAIR. The gentleman is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise to strongly oppose the Bur-
gess amendment and in support of the
underlying bill, the United States Ex-
port Finance Agency Act of 2019.
The science is really clear. The cli-
mate crisis is here, and we are already
seeing its devastating impact. Despite
the best efforts of the current adminis-
tration to the contrary, the United
States must be a global leader in act-
ing to combat the climate crisis.
Leading in climate action will not
only protect our future from the worst
impacts of climate change but will
make our Nation more competitive and
enable U.S. companies and workers to
own the clean energy technologies and
jobs of tomorrow.
I was proud to work with all of my
colleagues on the Financial Services
Committee to introduce an amendment
in markup that added strong environ-
mental protections to this reauthoriza-
tion.
Mr. Chairman, H.R. 4863 provides im-
portant reforms to the Ex-Im Bank to
ensure it is able to support America’s
exporters in the 21st century. Let me
describe precisely what this amend-
ment would eliminate.
It would eliminate a new office fo-
cused on supporting renewable energy-
related exports so that we can make
these products here in the United
States and sell them around the world.
It would eliminate a new target that
5 percent of Ex-Im’s financing goes to
support renewable energy-related ex-
ports.
It would eliminate a requirement
that the Ex-Im Bank consult with local
communities to ensure that U.S.-fi-
nanced projects are not causing harm.
It would eliminate a direction from
Congress that the Ex-Im Bank estab-
lish an accountability mechanism to
provide persons who may have been
negatively affected by an Ex-Im
project to find resolution.
And it would eliminate required dis-
closures of the estimated CO2 emissions
expected to be produced from Ex-Im
supported projects.
Mr. Chairman, these provisions were
carefully crafted by the committee to
protect the environment and support
American workers. However, all of
those environmental reforms would be
eliminated by the Burgess amendment,
harming our efforts to compete with
China on new environmental tech-
nologies and undermining Ex-Im’s ef-
forts to responsibly finance projects
around the world.
Why? Because of this theory about
economics. Let me be very clear. Coal
is dying right now for the same reason
that clean energy is rising, because of
economics.
Does it cost money to build new
projects? You bet it does. Where I come
from, that is called an investment, es-
pecially when you replace a 1950s tech-
nology with a high marginal operating
cost with a new, modern technology
that doesn’t cost anything to operate.
Claiming economics in defense of
blocking clean energy is foolish. It is
irresponsible. It ain’t leadership. It is
cowardice. It is irresponsible.
This is the time we have to stand up
and lead, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, with all
due respect to my colleague, I don’t
think he understands my amendment.
Nuclear energy has zero emissions.
Hydrogen has zero emissions. Natural
gas has much-reduced emissions com-
pared to coal.
The advantage of nuclear energy is it
is always on. Renewable is not always
on.
This is a chance to give the import-
ing companies a chance to have clean
energy, affordable energy, and to be
able to advance their economies using
U.S. know-how and technology, which
leads in several of these areas.
I urge a ‘‘yea’’ vote for my amend-
ment because it is the right thing to do
if we really care about emissions reduc-
tion, affordability around the world,
and being able to export the United
States’ leading technology and clean
energy.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. WATERS),
the chairwoman of the committee.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
I strongly oppose this amendment.
This amendment undermines a care-
fully crafted compromise on environ-
mental reforms, both in the underlying
bill and developed by my good friend
from Illinois.
It undermines U.S. leadership on
growing more jobs in renewable energy,
eliminates accountability at Ex-Im,
and ends efforts to have Ex-Im consult
with local communities on projects it
supports.
I urge all of my colleagues to oppose
this amendment.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, has the gentleman from Texas
closed?
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Texas has relinquished his time.
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
Mr. Chairman, the amendment under
consideration has nothing to do with
moving the Ex-Im forward. Instead, it
eliminates needed reforms in the un-
derlying bill to modernize the Bank
and bring it into the 21st century. It
takes this bill back toward the past
rather than looking toward the future.
I urge all my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’
on this misguided amendment. I yield
back the balance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. FLORES).
The question was taken; and the
Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.

sider amendment No. 4 printed in
House Report 116–289.

The text of the amendment is as fol-

Page 21, line 9, strike ‘‘or’’.
Page 21, after line 9, insert the following:
‘‘(C) sanctions relating to the illegal traf-
ficking of synthetic opioids, including any

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 695, the gentleman from Utah
(Mr. MCADAMS) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Utah.
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Chair, my
amendment builds on the work of the
underlying bill, which has strong and
smart prohibitions on financing to bad
actors known to the U.S. Government,
such as those violating U.S. laws re-
lated to trade and economic sanctions.
Specifically, my amendment ensures
that the Export-Import Bank, renamed
as the U.S. Export Finance Agency
under the bill, prohibits any trans-
action to people involved in
sanctionable activities related to the
illegal trafficking of synthetic opioids,
including any sanctions imposed pursu-
ant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin
Designation Act.
We know synthetic opioid trafficking
is a problem, specifically coming from
China, where they are the leading pro-
ducer of fentanyl. We have taken bipar-
tisan action in this Congress to put
more pressure on China to stop opioid
trafficking, which is fueling so many
deaths and so much tragedy across our
communities.
Earlier this year, we passed legisla-
tion introduced by my colleague from
New York (Mr. ROSE), who is a cospon-
sor of this amendment, the Fentanyl
Sanctions Act. That act would apply

pressure to the Chinese Government to
honor their commitment to make all
fentanyl illegal and to provide the
United States with more tools and re-
sources to go after illicit traffickers in
China, Mexico, and other countries.
This amendment builds on that effort
by ensuring those bad actors are not
seeing the benefit of our export finance
agency and that U.S. companies are
not engaged in business with criminal
enterprises abroad.
Mr. Chair, this is a commonsense
amendment. We should not be doing
business with bad actors, especially
those that are poisoning our commu-
nities with synthetic opioids.
I urge adoption of this amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I
claim time in opposition, but I am not
opposed to the amendment.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman from Ohio is recognized for
5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Chair,
first, let me say Republicans unani-
mously voted to support the Waters-
McHenry bipartisan deal to strengthen
the Export-Import Bank and combat
Chinese aggression, but we will not
support this partisan bill.
This is yet another do-nothing
amendment offered by the Democrats
so they can send out a press release
claiming they care about national se-
curity or, in this case, the opioid crisis.
In fact, it is a poison pill meant to
counter an amendment that will be of-
fered shortly.
‘‘Amend and pretend’’ is going to be
a running theme during this debate.
Like another measure offered today by
Mrs. TORRES, Mr. MCADAMS’ amend-
ment would simply require Ex-Im users
to self-certify that they are not break-
ing the law by violating opioid traf-
ficking sanctions. This way, Democrats
can claim that they don’t like opioids.
See how it works? They push this
bill. It means nothing. Criminals, of
course, are going to say: No. Who, me?
I wouldn’t violate the law.
The real opioid measure that we have
before us today is being offered by me
shortly. Mr. MCADAMS’ amendment
would actually prevent Ex-Im assist-
ance from going to foreign govern-
ments that significantly contribute to
opioid trafficking if those governments
fail to cooperate with U.S.
antinarcotics efforts. That is a serious
amendment. It prevents taxpayer-
backed financing from going to govern-
ments that help to poison taxpayers. It
is logical.
Unfortunately, my opioid trafficking
amendment was so logical that Demo-
crats opposed it in committee and have
pledged to oppose it here on the floor
shortly.
Again, this McAdams amendment is
about a press release for Democrats, so
amend and pretend it is today with the
McAdams amendment.
b 1600
I want to be clear that I do not op-
pose the amendment, but I am opposed
and disappointed that my Democratic
colleagues have offered another amend-
ment that is another stunt provision
for this dead-end bill.
We had a bipartisan path forward,
and Democrats are wasting floor time
with this bill that will never be en-
acted to law.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. WATERS), the
chair of the House Financial Services
Committee.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank
him for offering this important amend-
ment.
This amendment builds on the impor-
tant work of the gentleman from New
York on combating illegal opioids in
this country. It ensures that those who
are sanctioned because of their in-
volvement in the illegal trade of
opioids do not get access to Ex-Im as-
sistance, including any sanctions im-
posed pursuant to the Foreign Nar-
cotics Kingpin Designation Act.
I strongly support the gentleman’s
amendment to strengthen this bill with
respect to preventing the illegal traf-
ficking of synthetic opioids and urge
all my colleagues to do so.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Chair-
man, as we will see shortly, to high-
light the fact that this isn’t about get-
ting the provision into law, I am con-
fident a recorded vote will be requested
because it is all theater. It is not
meant to change the law in a sub-
stantive way; it is meant to provide
cover.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, the bill before us is a
strong measure to support economic
development and to support job cre-
ation throughout our country. The leg-
islation improves the agency’s ability
to support exports, and it supports
small businesses in my home State of
Utah. It is supported by businesses and
labor, and it does this all at no expense
to the taxpayer.
Miles Hansen, who is the president
and CEO of the World Trade Center
Utah, said that the Export-Import
Bank plays an important role in sup-
porting Utah’s economic growth and
Utah’s companies’ ability to compete
with countries such as China, Brazil,
the U.K., and Germany: ‘‘Direct access
to the Export Finance Agency’s finance
and risk management programs pro-
vide Utah’s small businesses with crit-
ical tools for international growth.’’
I agree with Mr. Hansen, and I am a
strong supporter of the agency and the
underlying bill, which strengthens and
reauthorizes Ex-Im for 10 years.
My amendment is a commonsense ad-
dition to the bill to ensure that we are
not doing business with opioid traf-
fickers overseas. I urge adoption of the
amendment, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
final passage.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Utah (Mr. MCADAMS).
The question was taken; and the

SEC. ll. PROHIBITION ON ASSISTANCE TO GOV-

ATE ON PREVENTING ILLEGAL
TRAFFICKING OF SYNTHETIC
OPIOIDS.
Section 2 of the Export-Import Bank Act of
1945 (12 U.S.C. 635), as amended by the pre-
ceding provisions of this Act, is amended by
adding at the end the following:
‘‘(n) PROHIBITION ON ASSISTANCE TO GOV-
ERNMENT THAT FAILS TO COOPERATE ON PRE-
VENTING ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING OF SYNTHETIC
OPIOIDS.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Agency may not au-
thorize the provision of financial assistance
for a lender, obligor, or end user that—
‘‘(A) is a covered government; and

Financial Services of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Committee on Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate
that the financial assistance—
‘‘(i) would enable exports directly by
United States small business concerns; or
‘‘(ii) is required for the export of humani-
tarian goods or services.

The President of the United States may
waive paragraph (1) for not more than 1 year
at a time on reporting to the committees
specified in subparagraph (A) that the waiver
is essential to the national interest of the
United States, with a detailed explanation of
the reasons therefor.

United States with respect to opioid traf-
ficking.
‘‘(4) DEFINITIONS.—In this subsection:
‘‘(A) COVERED GOVERNMENT.—The term
‘covered government’ means—
‘‘(i) the state and the government of China,
the state and the government of Mexico, and
the state and the government of any other
country that, in the determination of the
President of the United States, is a signifi-
cant contributor to opioid trafficking, as
well as any political subdivision, agency, or
instrumentality of any of the foregoing;
‘‘(ii) any entity owned or controlled, di-
rectly or indirectly, by any of the foregoing,
including any corporation, partnership, asso-
ciation, or other entity in which any of the
foregoing owns a 50 percent or greater inter-
est or a controlling interest, and any entity
which is otherwise controlled by any of the
foregoing;
‘‘(iii) any person that is or has been acting
or purporting to act, directly or indirectly,
for or on behalf of any of the foregoing; and
‘‘(iv) any other person which the Secretary
of the Treasury determines is included in
any of the foregoing.
‘‘(B) OPIOID TRAFFICKING.—The term ‘opioid
trafficking’ means any illicit activity—
‘‘(i) to produce, manufacture, distribute,
sell, or knowingly finance or transport—
‘‘(I) synthetic opioids, including controlled
substances that are synthetic opioids and
listed chemicals that are synthetic opioids;

with other persons to carry out such an ac-
tivity.
‘‘(5) REPORT REQUIRED.—If the Agency au-
thorizes financial assistance for a lender, ob-
ligor, or end user that is a covered govern-
ment and the authorization is not made pur-
suant to waiver authorities provide in para-
graph (2), the President of the United States
shall certify to the Committee on Financial
Services of the House of Representatives and
the Committee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs of the Senate that the covered
government is closely cooperating with the
United States, within the meaning of para-
graph (3), with a description of the coopera-
tion.’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 695, the gentleman from Ohio
(Mr. DAVIDSON) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Ohio.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to start
off by saying that I wholeheartedly
support reauthorization of the Export-
Import Bank. It is an important tool to
help ensure American companies can
stay competitive in foreign markets
and can be used as an important na-
tional security tool in countering
countries such as China.
Unfortunately, there are several
commonsense reforms that I think
could dramatically improve the agency
but which are not being considered
under this bill, which is why I am offer-
ing my amendment.
My amendment is modeled after the
bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act, in-
troduced in the House by MAX ROSE
and cosponsored by our colleague from
Arkansas, FRENCH HILL. In the Senate,
the Senate minority leader, Democrat
CHUCK SCHUMER, is the lead sponsor,
joined by Republican Senator PAT
TOOMEY and others.
Under the House and Senate fentanyl
bills, the President could waive sanc-
tions against foreign state-owned
banks if a foreign government is close-
ly cooperating with our efforts to pre-
vent opioid trafficking.
This amendment’s approach is simi-
lar. It simply says that the United
States will oppose Ex-Im Bank assist-
ance to a government and the entities
it controls if the President determines
that the government isn’t cooperating
with us to stop the flood of opioids into
our country. China and Mexico, in par-
ticular, have been identified by the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency as pri-
mary producers of these opioids.
This amendment is not targeting
those who need assistance from the
United States most; in fact, my amend-
ment would provide a waiver where ex-
ports are needed to the government in
question for the export of humani-
tarian goods or services. We want to
help those who need assistance, but we
must be doing all that we can do to
confront the opioid epidemic that is
wreaking havoc in the United States.
According to the Centers for Disease
Control, opioids are the main driver of
opioid deaths in America, with deaths
linked to synthetic opioids, especially
fentanyl, rising exponentially. Areas in
southwest Ohio, where I represent,
have some of the highest per capita
opioid overdose deaths in the Nation.
And this is an epidemic impacting all
our Nation’s communities. In 2017
alone, 28,000 deaths in the United
States involved synthetic opioids, and
deaths have risen all across demo-
graphic groups in nearly half of U.S.
States.
In short, this is a problem that
touches all of us, and close cooperation
with countries receiving Ex-Im assist-
ance from the United States is essen-
tial.
If we care about stopping this epi-
demic, my amendment is a small but
important step that we should all be
able to agree on. I urge my colleagues
to support its adoption.
I want to clarify that countries that
have problems, like China or Mexico,
don’t need to completely eliminate
their problem; what they do need to do
is cooperate with the United States,
and when they do, the Export-Import
Bank can continue to function well
where it was designed to function well.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. RUIZ). The
gentlewoman from California is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment demonstrates a funda-
mental misunderstanding about what
Ex-Im does and whom it benefits.
The beneficiaries of Ex-Im’s assist-
ance are U.S. exporters and the Amer-
ican workers they employ. It is in
America’s interest to have a fully func-
tioning Ex-Im because it allows U.S.
companies to compete in the global
markets.
Mr. DAVIDSON’s amendment would ef-
fectively ban using the Ex-Im Bank in
China or Mexico to try to put pressure
on Governments of Mexico and China
to cooperate with the U.S. to stop the
trafficking of synthetic opioids.
No one wants to support the traf-
ficking of opioids, but Ex-Im is pre-
cisely the wrong agency to use to
achieve foreign policy outcomes. If
Mexico or China do not cooperate,
those countries will not be harmed by
this amendment; American companies
and workers will be. The Mexican or
Chinese Governments will simply buy
products from another country that is
more than willing to sell them exports.
If the goal is to fight the opioid cri-
sis, we need to support programs like
Ex-Im that are going to be creating
good, well-paying jobs in every district
all over the country and support small
businesses that are the drivers of com-
munity investment and development.
And if we really want to put pressure
on foreign governments to cooperate
with the U.S. in preventing the traf-
ficking of opioids, then we need to bol-
ster our sanctions program, which can
deny the bad actor to the largest econ-
omy in the world.
I understand Mr. DAVIDSON’s strongly
held desire to do something to address
this opioid epidemic and to protect Ex-
Im from being improperly accessed by
criminal networks trafficking in syn-
thetic opioids. That is why I strongly
support Mr. MCADAMS’ and Mr. ROSE’s
amendment to directly cut off Ex-Im
financing from those criminal entities
that violate sanctions dealing with il-
legal opioids, including violations of
the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Des-
ignation Act. Mr. ROSE also has legisla-
tion pending that would further broad-
en those who are sanctioned under U.S.
law for illegal opioids.
Mr. DAVIDSON’s concerns are under-
standable, but in practice, this amend-
ment would limit the ability of Ex-Im
to support U.S. jobs and small busi-
nesses, further exacerbating the condi-
tions that have contributed to this
opioid epidemic.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to vote against this amendment, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Chair-
man, how much time do I have remain-
ing?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio has 2 minutes remaining.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
I would like to make the point that
this amendment that I have offered has
substance because it expects something
for America’s assistance.
At least some of my colleagues are
consistent: They don’t want the Presi-
dent of the United States, whoever

that is, to expect anything from a for-
eign power in exchange for American
participation. They want nothing in re-
turn for our dollars, no condition on
their behavior.
In fact, rather than trusting the
United States of America to determine
whether a country is cooperating with
us on our efforts to stop synthetic
opioids, they want to trust the people
who may very well be using the system
to create that market for their own
benefit, self-certification.
I am sure the Sinaloa Cartel would
certify that they don’t participate in
trafficking drugs, as well.
That is what the McAdams approach
does. That is the version that our
chairwoman has, unfortunately, chosen
to support, and I believe it is the wrong
path.
I encourage people to support this
amendment if they are serious about
trying to stop opioids and if they are
serious about using the foreign policy
tools, including trade, that the United
States has to offer.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. HECK)
Mr. HECK. Mr. Chairman, I under-
stand the temptation to dabble in for-
eign affairs when it comes to Ex-Im re-
authorization. We have seen a lot of
that here today. But there is a reason
why we have separate committees in
the House: so that Members can de-
velop expertise and apply that exper-
tise. Financial services, simply put, is
not the main repository of that kind of
expertise, and it shows in this ap-
proach.
But let me be clear: No one here
wants to support the trafficking of syn-
thetic opioids, of course not. There is a
right way and a wrong way to do it.
This is the wrong way to do it.
And, in fact, if my friend, the author
of this amendment, and I do consider
him a friend—if you want to ensure
that those who are sanctioned for deal-
ing illegal opioids cannot use this
Bank, vote in support; indeed, vote in
support of the McAdams amendment.
It is not theater. It is not cover. It is a
strong amendment that is targeted and
substantive and, in fact, is going to get
at the very underlying problem with-
out costing American jobs and without
hurting American businesses.
So I urge you to join the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee or support the efforts
of the McAdams amendment.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, this misguided amend-
ment is going to hurt American work-
ers and American businesspersons. This
is not the way to get at the issue the
gentleman from Ohio is concerned
about. He should be supporting the
McAdams-Rose amendment if he wants
to do that.
I urge all my colleagues to vote
against this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Chair-
man, I demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Ohio will be post-
poned.
AMENDMENT NO. 6 OFFERED BY MS. TLAIB
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 6 printed in
House Report 116–289.
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 16, after line 8, insert the following:
(2) REPORT ON ACTIVITIES IN ECONOMICALLY
DISADVANTAGED REGIONS.—Section 8 of such
Act (12 U.S.C. 635g), as amended by sections
6(b) and 7(b) of this Act, is amended by add-
ing at the end the following:
‘‘(n) REPORT ON ACTIVITIES IN ECONOMI-
CALLY DISADVANTAGED REGIONS.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Agency shall include
in its annual report to Congress under sub-
section (a) a report on the steps taken by the
Agency in the period covered by the report
to increase—
‘‘(A) awareness of the Agency and its serv-
ices in economically disadvantaged regions;
and
‘‘(B) the provision of Agency support to ex-
port businesses in economically disadvan-
taged regions.
‘‘(2) DEFINITION.—In paragraph (1), the
term ‘economically disadvantaged region’
means a county or equivalent division of
local government of a State in which, ac-
cording to the most recently available data
from the Bureau of the Census, 20 percent or
more of the residents have an annual income
that is at or below the poverty level.’’.

‘‘(3)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentlewoman
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan.
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment would require that Ex-Im
provide an annual report to the United
States Congress on the agency’s activ-
ity in economically disadvantaged
areas and efforts that they are taking
to support those areas.
Government must be about people
first, so when we talk about economic
opportunity, Mr. Chair, we must ensure
that we are using every tool possible to
uplift communities that are struggling
like my district.
b 1615
After the Great Recession of 2008, the
country experienced an economic re-
covery from 2011 to 2015, but already
vulnerable communities missed out on
most of that growth and opportunity.
There is no question that some commu-
nities suffer more and take longer to
recover, and sometimes it takes dec-
ades longer, but it shouldn’t be this
way.
There is evidence that adequate re-
porting and proper investment may be
able to speed that pace of recovery for
these kinds of communities.
According to the Economic Innova-
tion Group, 52.3 million people, or 17
percent of the American population,
experienced an average 6 percent drop
in the number of adults working and a
6.3 percent average drop in the number
of business establishments.
Specifically, Mr. Chair, workers and
their families living in especially hard-
hit communities face challenges such
as unemployment that often arises
from mass layoffs associated with de-
clines in specific industries and busi-
nesses.
For communities like mine, 13 dis-
tricts strong, the impact on employ-
ment and income can be extremely per-
sistent.
Currently, Detroit is one of the five
cities with the greatest number of peo-
ple in distressed ZIP codes and it ranks
number ten as the most distressed city
in the United States of the country’s
100 largest cities. Wayne County,
Michigan, which I represent, ranks sec-
ond in the Nation for inequality with
job creation.
Addressing the economic and social
costs associated with persistent local-
ized economic distresses requires ade-
quate reporting, as it is essential to ad-
dressing the causes and the costs of
long-term economic distress for work-
ers, their families, and the commu-
nities.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment to help ensure
that we have the tools to uplift every
community across the country like
mine.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment, even though I am not opposed to
it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, let me say
first that Republicans unanimously
voted to support the Waters-McHenry
bipartisan deal to strengthen the Bank
and combat Chinese aggression, but we
are not going to support this partisan
bill here on the floor today.
This amendment is a fine one. This
amendment, as with some other
amendments that the Democrats are
offering today that the Rules Com-
mittee made in order—as I understand
it, they made in order 19 Democrat
amendments and two Republican
amendments, so that is quite a ratio,
but I think there is a point where addi-
tional reporting requirements, as I said
earlier, and other mandates can burden
an agency to the point of diminishing
returns.
If you want the Export-Import Bank
to be effective, it is often better to ad-
vocate for initiatives within the Bank,

like the Waters-McHenry bill, and
make the Bank focus on priorities.
This is one area, with opportunity
zones, that we support in a bipartisan
way to get investment in disadvan-
taged communities across the country.
Those opportunity zones are a part of
now tax law.
That standalone bill was a bipartisan
one last Congress and the Congress be-
fore that had great consensus. So what
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.
TLAIB) is advocating here matches up
quite nicely with that to ensure that
the Bank is focused on those same
areas that have been historically dis-
advantaged or economically left be-
hind.
Some of those areas are in my dis-
trict, some are in her district, but they
are throughout the country.
So, as I said, I do not oppose the
amendment, I support the amendment,
and I think it is important for the
Bank to focus on important commu-
nities across the country, but espe-
cially those that are economically dis-
advantaged.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, I think it is
really important, and I am glad the
ranking member did mention the op-
portunity zones. One of the key con-
troversies around opportunity zones
right now is that out of the hundreds of
opportunity zone census tracks that
were chosen, five did not qualify under
the poverty guidelines requirements
for opportunity zones.
Reporting like this creates trans-
parency and accountability, Mr. Chair,
and that is why it is critically impor-
tant that we don’t make the mistake
again to support these kinds of tax
breaks and loans and opportunities
through the Federal Government with-
out any accountability and follow-
through with the United States Con-
gress annually. That is why it is criti-
cally important.
We are talking about five commu-
nities that should not have gotten the
opportunity zone designation, includ-
ing two in the city of Detroit that were
promoted by billionaire Dan Gilbert. It
should never have been designated.
They didn’t qualify, Mr. Chair.
That is why it is important that we
have these kinds of amendments and
requirements that the United States
Congress can then proceed to create
transparency.
I fully support, obviously, opportuni-
ties for development in communities
that deserve it, especially representing
the third poorest congressional district
in the country. However, we cannot
allow those political donors, like the
billionaire Dan Gilbert, to pick and
choose where those opportunity zones
are designated.
However, we are talking about Ex-Im
today, and let’s do this right by sup-
porting this kind of annual reporting
to make sure that we are helping eco-
nomically disadvantaged communities
like ours to be able to, again, have ac-
countability for the American people.
Again, I rise in support, as I hope my
colleagues support me in rising in sup-
port of this amendment, again, to
make sure that we do our due diligence
as Members of Congress in making sure
there are no other kind of scandalous
controversies that we see now with the
opportunity zones in our country.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I would say, Mr. Chair, to my col-
league from Michigan, under the oppor-
tunity zones provision of the tax bill
we passed last year, governors des-
ignate those census tracks. So if the
gentlewoman has a problem with the
census tracks designated in Michigan,
that is a problem with the Governor of
Michigan, not the underlying impor-
tant tax law.
Mr. Chair, I would also commend my
colleague, this is her first term in Con-
gress, two Congresses ago this was a bi-
partisan bill, it had wide bipartisan
support, and we had a similar number
of Republicans and Democrats support
the opportunity zone legislation. And I
think it is really important, powerful
legislation, important law now that is
going to have a strong impact on those
economically disadvantaged commu-
nities, many in my district and those
across the country. I think it is going
to have a very positive effect over the
long-term.
Mr. Chair, I would say again, I sup-
port this amendment, will not oppose,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, again, I com-
pletely agree that that is the process.
However, it is our responsibility, since
we are the ones who created the bipar-
tisan support of opportunity zones.
However, it doesn’t make it exempt
from corruption, Mr. Chair, and that is
exactly what is happening.
So then-Governor Snyder may have
given his friend an advantage by not
complying with the opportunity zone
requirement that it be a poverty-
stricken census track, that it is within
those guidelines. That did not happen.
So it is our due diligence, because we
allowed the pathway for opportunity
zones, to have accountability. And this
amendment basically allows us to
check in, Mr. Chair, and make sure
that they are following those guide-
lines, and that is exactly what didn’t
happen with the opportunity zones.
Just because they were bipartisan does
not mean they were exempt from cor-
ruption, it is exempt from account-
ability.
Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle will join me
in having transparency and account-
ability. It is our responsibility. They
are our tax dollars. They are our pro-
grams that we have to, again, hold ac-
countable for those that take advan-
tage by using the system and tainting
the process.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.

House Report 116–289.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

Self-Determination and Education Assist-

State of Alaska)’’.

House Resolution 695, the gentleman

opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Hawaii.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Chair, I rise today in
support of my amendment to confirm
that Native Hawaiians and Alaska Na-
tives are included for the purposes and
considerations of the U.S. Export Fi-
nance Agency’s new Office of Minority
and Women Inclusion.
I am very proud to be joined in offer-
ing this amendment by my friend and
colleague, the dean of this House, the
gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG).
In reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank of
the United States, H.R. 4863 would cre-
ate an Office of Minority and Women
Inclusion for the new U.S. Export Fi-
nance Agency. This office would be re-
sponsible for engaging with minority-
owned and women-owned businesses in
the program, contracts and activities
of the agency. This includes outreach
to those businesses to ensure their
awareness of the export assistance pro-
vided by the agency.
The laudable policy goal of this office
is to increase access to export assist-
ance and foster overall business for
underrepresented communities.
However, H.R. 4863 currently uses ref-
erences to section 1204(c) of the Finan-
cial Institutions Reform, Recovery,
and Enforcement Act of 1989, which de-
fines ‘‘minority’’ as ‘‘any Black Amer-
ican, Native American, Hispanic Amer-
ican, or Asian American.’’
Because of the unique statuses that
Native Hawaiians and Alaska Natives
have and the complexities of Federal
law, the term ‘‘Native American’’ is
not always understood to include Na-
tive Hawaiians and Alaska Natives.
My amendment is a simple clarifica-
tion that for the purposes of the agen-
cy and its Office of Minority and
Women Inclusion, those groups are in-
cluded, as they are for many other
comparable Federal programs.
Adopting this amendment ensures
that Native Hawaiian-owned and Alas-
ka Native-owned businesses will be

part of the agency’s outreach efforts
and have greater opportunity to ben-
efit from the agency’s export assist-
ance.
In my home State of Hawaii, Native
Hawaiian-owned businesses are an es-
sential part of our economy, but this is
also true in countless other commu-
nities throughout our country.
According to the 2012 Survey of Busi-
ness Owners, there are almost 26,000
Native Hawaiian-owned businesses in
the United States, employing over
20,000 people.
Improving outreach to Native Hawai-
ian-owned businesses by the agency
provides these businesses the chance to
grow and expand opportunities for the
families and communities they sup-
port, not just in Hawaii, but across the
country.
Native Hawaiian-owned businesses
contribute to the economies of every
single State and the District of Colum-
bia. Nearly half of those businesses op-
erate outside of Hawaii.
These statistics demonstrate the in-
volvement of Native Hawaiian busi-
nesses in our business communities,
but they also do not adequately give
voice to the extent to which their busi-
nesses contribute to the overall em-
powerment of Native Hawaiian commu-
nities, nor do such numbers tell the
story of the countless lives that have
been improved and the communities
strengthened as a result of their inno-
vation and entrepreneurship.
Everything that I have said here
today applies equally to Alaska Na-
tives, as I am sure Mr. YOUNG would be
quick to point out.
This amendment will ensure that the
reauthorized agency will help Native
Hawaiian-owned and Alaska Native-
owned businesses pursue new business
opportunities, support American jobs
across the country, and sustain and en-
rich the communities they support, as
will be the case for other minority- and
women-owned businesses.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment, even though I am not opposed to
it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, let me say
first, Republicans unanimously voted
for the Waters-McHenry bipartisan
deal to strengthen the Bank and com-
bat Chinese aggression, but we are not
going to support this partisan bill.
I would note that the amendment of-
fered here clarifies the definition of mi-
norities under the section of the bill
that was a priority for the chair of our
committee, Chairwoman WATERS,
which is the Office of Minority and
Women Inclusion, which is referred to
as OMWI.
I would just note that in this bill, the
Democrats have prioritized OMWIs
over the global economic and national
security threats posed by China and
even Russia.
OMWIs are important. That is fine.
We included that in the bipartisan bill,
and that was part of the tradeoff of a
bipartisan bill, including something
that was a priority for Chairwoman
WATERS, but also in that agreement
were provisions that were tough on
China. I thought it was a fair trade in
order to get a bipartisan bill.
OMWIs and being tough on China are
not mutually exclusive ideas, but my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
felt that they needed to prioritize, and
so they chose OMWIs as opposed to a
rational stance against Chinese aggres-
sion or even Russian actions.
To the extent that Mr. CASE’s amend-
ment clarifies language that will have
no impact and will not be enacted any-
way, I don’t oppose it.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
b 1630
Mr. CASE. Mr. Chairman, I appre-
ciate very much that, in the middle of
the remarks of my colleague, I cer-
tainly heard and detected support for
this amendment.
I appreciate my colleague in the mi-
nority recognizing the importance of
minority- and women-owned businesses
throughout our country and their con-
tributions to our export community.
This is certainly consistent with my
colleagues’ earlier comments that they
fully support the provisions of this bill
that do, in fact, recognize that dis-
advantaged communities throughout
our country often need extra assist-
ance. As I said earlier, this is con-
sistent very much with other Federal
programs.
I would certainly, to the gentleman’s
comments about China, Russia, and
other countries, emphasize that, in this
particular area, the more American
businesses that can participate in ex-
port-related activities throughout the
world, the better we will all be in this
country with respect to our relations
with these other countries.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Chairman, I would say to my col-
league, yes, it is important that we
have robust global trade. Ex-Im, at its
height, at its strongest year, supported
just shy of 2 percent of American ex-
ports.
I don’t want to diminish a little less
than 2 percent, but most export is done
through the private sector without a
government program like Ex-Im.
I would also say that, as a matter of
our national interest, we shouldn’t be
subsidizing Chinese foreign policy with
One Belt, One Road. We shouldn’t be
subsidizing their island-building in the
Pacific. We shouldn’t be subsidizing
their actions in Hong Kong. That is
what we negotiated with the Waters-
McHenry bipartisan bill.
I am disappointed that we are not
dealing with that policy. Instead, the
majority decided to go the partisan
route, which the Republican majority
leader of the Senate has already said is
dead on arrival. The President said he
is going to veto this bill.
We could have gone a bipartisan
route with a bipartisan outcome, but
they chose a different route.
Look, the majority is the majority.
They have the votes to go do what they
want to do. But that means I don’t
need to vote for bad policy just to get
along. That is why I tried to negotiate
a good bill, and that is why we had a
good bill.
Mr. Chairman, I support the amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. ROUDA). The
question is on the amendment offered

Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I com-
mend the chairwoman of the Financial
Services Committee and the commit-
tee’s efforts to support exports in re-
newable energy and energy-efficiency
technology.
My amendment makes clear that
when it comes to supporting domestic
businesses exporting green energy
technology, electric vehicles need to be
near the top of that list. It quite sim-
ply states that ‘‘energy efficiency’’ in-
cludes electric vehicles as well as the
batteries and the charging infrastruc-
ture needed to make them move.
Electric vehicles are good for the en-
vironment; they are good for the econ-
omy; and they are good for our na-
tional security. Zero-emission electric
vehicles will help combat the climate
crisis. Since transportation accounts

for 15 percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions, electric vehicles are critical
for the future of clean energy.
Electric vehicles also present a huge
opportunity for the U.S. economy. We
now know that 4 million jobs in the
auto industry are reliant on us con-
tinuing to build new innovation. We
will lose hundreds of thousands of jobs
if we don’t recognize the importance of
building more electric vehicles. The
global market will be a strong growth
sector, and letting the rest of the world
beat us out will cost us mightily in
economic prosperity and domestic
manufacturing.
Though the United States was home
to the first highway-ready all-electric
car, the Tesla Roadster, Chinese com-
petitors have outpaced us and are
poised to dominate the market. China
sells half of all electric vehicles in the
world, while the United States sells a
mere 10 percent.
The figures for domestic battery pro-
duction are even more stark. China
controls a whopping 75 percent of glob-
al battery capacity, 15 times more than
our 5 percent. Because batteries will be
the backbone of the 21st century econ-
omy, they are essential to our national
security.
For a future of clean energy and a
thriving automotive industry, I ask
you to support this amendment. And I
am proud to be soon introducing com-
prehensive legislation to incentivize
electric vehicle use and production and
stimulate American jobs.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KIL-
DEE).
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank
Congresswoman SPEIER for her leader-
ship on climate issues in general and
specifically on electric vehicles.
Mr. Chairman, we are suffering the
climate crisis right now. In my home
State of Michigan, climate change is
changing our environment impacting
the Great Lakes: record lake levels,
algal blooms, and invasive species like
Asian carp.
As Members of Congress, we have a
duty to act on commonsense policies
that support climate solutions, and
this amendment is a good example of
that.
I support this amendment because it
will make explicit the Export-Import
Bank’s role in supporting clean energy
in our domestic exports, especially
electric vehicles, their components,
and vehicle charging infrastructure.
As Congresswoman SPEIER said,
China makes more electric vehicles
than anybody else in the world. That
doesn’t have to be the case. We have to
invest in policy that supports electric
vehicles so that the U.S. can lead the
future in transportation. This amend-
ment would help to do that.
I come from Flint, Michigan, a com-
munity with a great auto history. But
I have seen automotive jobs sent over-
seas over the years, and the livelihood
of families I represent go right along
with those jobs, because we have failed
to see the future. We have failed to see
around the corner. We have failed to
invest in the future and claim that fu-
ture for ourselves.
This amendment will ensure one ad-
ditional piece that makes sure that we
have a claim on the future and that we
can be the leader in electric vehicles. It
is the right thing to do. I support the
amendment, and I support the under-
lying legislation.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition, though I
am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, let me
say first that Republicans unanimously
voted in the Financial Services Com-
mittee to support the bipartisan bill
that Chairwoman WATERS and I nego-
tiated to strengthen the Bank and
combat Chinese aggression, but we are
not going to support this partisan bill
on the floor today.
It does seem strange that the sponsor
needs to spell out that energy storage,
which already appears in the text, re-
fers to batteries. I think it is a good
thing, a fine thing, but energy storage
is the broader terminology that we had
discussed, in terms of the negotiations
between Chairwoman WATERS and I.
We both share, as I do with the
amendment sponsor, the need for more
options in the marketplace, including
better batteries for cars and for mobil-
ity purposes, for sure. So I would com-
mend the sponsor’s interest in electric
vehicles and related infrastructure. I
think it is a good thing. I think we
have nice bipartisan support, actually
growing support among Republicans,
for some sensible policies that would
have a positive impact on our environ-
ment and, at the same time, have more
options in the marketplace for con-
sumers so they can choose how they
seek to power their homes, their cars,
and their lives.
What Chairwoman WATERS and I ne-
gotiated is in H.R. 3407. That bill
pushed Ex-Im to devote no less than 20
percent of its authority to technologies
of tomorrow. This was a priority of
mine, and that was in that bill that is
not in the bill before us today. That is
a huge missed opportunity. That in-
cluded energy storage and energy-effi-
cient technologies.
Those provisions, I think, would have
had a really strong impact. I am sad-
dened that Chairwoman WATERS re-
jected that, in terms of the bill that
she filed and brought before us today.
The energy sources and technologies
of tomorrow are going to have the
most powerful impact on reducing car-
bon emissions, making sure that the
globe is safe and sustainable for gen-
erations to come. It is those techno-
logical breakthroughs that we should
prioritize, not just for carbon reduc-
tion, but for powering our economy.
I think there is opportunity for us to
legislate in a bipartisan way. I com-
mend Ms. SPEIER’s amendment. Unfor-
tunately, I don’t think this bill is
going to become law, so I don’t think it
is going to have the impact that we
need. But I think, on separate legisla-
tion, I would like to work with the
sponsor of this amendment on those
technological breakthroughs that we
have to have for our environment, for
my children and the children and
grandchildren of current Americans so
they can have a safe and sustainable
environment and have jobs at the same
time. It is the technological break-
throughs that are going to take us
there that I am so passionate about
and that are so impactful.
Mr. Chairman, I commend the
amendment sponsor, and I support its
adoption.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I like
the fact that we are speaking the same
language. It is wonderful to have that
opportunity. I look forward to working
with the gentleman on the other side of
the aisle on the legislation that I am
about to introduce. We might see some
bipartisan work here.
This is about green jobs. That is what
this amendment is all about. We have
to secure the jobs for the rest of this
century in the auto industry, and we
are not going to do it unless we move
into electric vehicles.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.

tlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER).

‘‘(2) SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS.—The au-
thority provided by paragraph (1) may be ex-

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentleman
from California (Mr. RUIZ) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I am offer-
ing my bill, the Increasing American
Jobs and Exports Act, as an amend-
ment to H.R. 4863.
Mr. Chairman, my amendment is
simple. It will allow the Export-Import
Bank to use up to 3 percent of its sur-
plus profits per year for 5 years to open
new regional offices. These additional
offices will grow small businesses by
assisting with their capital needs to in-
crease their exporting capacity and job
growth ability.
This bill will grow American jobs, in-
crease exports of American goods, and
strengthen our local and regional
economies around the country.
The Export-Import Bank is impor-
tant for our Nation. Over the last 10
years, it has supported more than 1.5
million jobs at absolutely no cost to
the American taxpayer. The Bank has
helped grow American jobs at no cost.
It has even returned more than $3.4 bil-
lion to the United States Treasury.
The Export-Import Bank helps grow
American jobs, grow small businesses,
and grow our economy.
Trade and exports are important to
my district and, specifically, to the
Coachella Valley in the Inland Empire.
The Inland Empire is one of the fastest
growing economic regions in the
United States and is a hub for inter-
national trade. The Riverside-San
Bernardino region is 38th nationally in
total export value and sixth in Cali-
fornia in total export value. Let me re-
mind everybody, California has the
fifth-largest economy in the world.
b 1645
The Riverside-San Bernardino Coun-
ties region is home to 6,200 exporters,
as well as $10 billion worth of exported
products.
More specifically, exports are impor-
tant to my district; and within
Coachella Valley agriculture, there are
$500 million worth of fruits, nuts, vege-
tables, and melons, and all are top
California exports. They are exported
to more than 50 countries.
I want this success repeated across
my district and the entire Nation. The
problem, however, is that the closest
Export-Import regional finance office
is more than a 2-hour drive away, in
San Diego. That office serves busi-
nesses in four California counties and
even three States: Montana, Wyoming,
and Arizona.
Small business owners who have the
product, the vision, and the ability to
expand their businesses deserve to have
local and regional access to export fi-
nancing services.
The potential for more American jobs
and more American exports is there.
We just have to unlock it. Regional fi-
nance offices help small businesses and
small farms succeed where private cap-
ital cannot.
Most of the farm businesses in my
district are small. Seventy-five percent
are fewer than 50 acres in size. Last
year, the Export-Import Bank financed
$1.1 billion worth of agricultural prod-
ucts, and 81 percent of those were small
businesses.
With more regional offices, we can
continue to grow American exports and
jobs and help small businesses com-
pete. I urge support of my amendment
and the Increasing American Jobs and
Exports Act, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition, and I am op-
posed to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment not be-
cause its goals are necessarily objec-
tionable. The gentleman is right to
focus on exports, especially given the
economy of his district and his State,
and his State’s and district’s impor-
tance to the Nation and the national
economy.
The reason why I am opposed to it is
because it doesn’t appear based on any
empirical study of Ex-Im resource
needs and may hinder the Bank from
working effectively.
To start, the amendment would allow
up to 3 percent of Ex-Im’s surplus to be
used for administrative expenses, on
top of the resources that it already
has. I am unaware of any concerns by
Ex-Im that it is unable to cover its ad-
ministrative expenses, currently.
Traditionally, excess funds from the
Bank’s surplus are supposed to go back
to the Treasury, where it can reduce
the deficit, something that both Re-
publicans and Democrats have long
supported and, I hope, will continue to
support.
In addition, the amendment seems to
only provide for this during half of the
reauthorization period. So what hap-
pens in the second half of Ex-Im Bank’s
reauthorization under the bill, and
would it leave Ex-Im without recourse
to the funds? We need to consider this
carefully.
Finally, the amendment would re-
quire that at least one-third of the new
surplus funds devoted to administra-
tive expenses be used to expand re-
gional finance centers. Regional fi-
nance centers are fine, but what is the
budgetary need?
Mr. Chair, I think a little more work
needs to be done. We didn’t have this
discussion during the markup or in the
single hearing we had about Ex-Im, and
since the one-third requirement in the
amendment would fluctuate from year
to year, it is divorced from Ex-Im’s ac-
tual assessment of needs for its re-
gional operations.
There are a couple of technical issues
here. I appreciate the gentleman for of-
fering the amendment and his interest
in serving his constituents, but for
these reasons I have outlined, I am op-
posed to the amendment.
Since I am in opposition, I do believe
I have the right to close and am willing
to close, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I just want
to clarify something, that the $3.4 bil-
lion surplus goes to the U.S. Treasury.
My bill will not take one-third of that,
only up to the 3 percent that would be
available for regions that would like to
have a regional finance office near
them.
For example, in North Carolina,
which my esteemed colleague is from,
his constituents have to drive all the
way to south Florida, to Miami, to get
services from the Export-Import Bank.
So it is in my constituents’ interest,
and it is the interest of my colleague’s
that a regional office is financed closer
to his State so that his businesses can
acquire the capital necessary to in-
crease jobs and increase exports.
In fact, there is data to show that the
cluster of businesses that benefit, by
far, are those that are near the sur-
rounding regional offices. So it is com-
mon sense to assume that, if you open
an office near the region, more busi-
nesses will benefit and you will have
created more jobs with more exports.
I want to thank Chairwoman WATERS
for her work on this important legisla-
tion and for her support for my amend-
ment. The Export-Import Bank has
been a success story and can continue
to grow. Today’s legislation will fur-
ther that success.
The Bank supports American jobs,
while also returning money to tax-
payers year after year. My amendment
would not cost the taxpayer a single
dime. My amendment would grow jobs
and businesses by exporting American
goods.
I urge my colleagues to support my
amendment, the Increasing American
Jobs and Exports Act, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
On this amendment, in 1 year, this
would be hundreds of millions of dol-
lars, and, in other years, it would be
zero. So to finance these regional fi-
nance centers, you probably want to
have more stable funding than that
fluctuation.
That is the technical problem, in my
view, on this, not that these regional
finance centers are a bad idea. They
are not a bad idea. In fact, I think it is
important that Ex-Im focuses on small
businesses and does more outreach
with small businesses.
The bill that I negotiated with Chair-
woman WATERS actually raises the
small business mandate. This bill fails
to do it until the 10th year. That focus

on small businesses would require Ex-
Im to deploy their resources more ef-
fectively across the country. That is
something Chairwoman WATERS and I
agreed to, on that need for greater out-
reach from just a couple of urban cen-
ters where they are currently planted,
as has been said.
So while I support the laudatory goal
of this, the functionality of it is not
workable. I would like the Bank to ac-
tually work. Of course, that is not part
of the debate that I would actually
have that view, but I actually do want
the Bank to work and be effective for
American businesses. It is really just
the technical problem of how the gen-
tleman allocates the resources here,
and that is why I oppose it.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. RUIZ).

Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.

ROUDA, Acting Chair of the Committee
of the Whole House on the state of the
Union, reported that that Committee,
having had under consideration the bill

port Finance Agency, and for other
purposes, had come to no resolution
thereon.

CONGRATULATING FORT WORTH’S
NORTH SIDE HIGH SCHOOL FOR
MAKING IT TO THE STATE HIGH
SCHOOL PLAYOFFS
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
congratulate a high school in the dis-
trict that I represent, North Side High
School. They are also known as the
Steers, and for the past couple of dec-
ades, this school has excelled in sports
like cross country, soccer, baseball,
and volleyball, but not under the Fri-
day night lights of Texas in football.
However, for the first time in 40
years, the football team has made it to
the State high school playoffs, and if
you are from Texas, you know that
that is a really, really big deal.
The school has a population of
around 1,800 students, and 95 percent
are Latino. North Side High School is
hoping to dispel the myth that the
community can’t succeed on the grid-
iron.
I want to congratulate Principal An-
tonio Martinez and Coach Joseph Tur-
ner—who was given the job 5 years ago
despite having zero head coaching ex-
perience—and all of the football play-
ers on the Steers team for their his-
toric accomplishment. They are really
a prime example of hard work and dedi-
cation and how far it can take you.
I hope that this will not be the last
time the Steers make the playoffs.
This has been just a great story for the
entire Fort Worth Independent School
District.
Tomorrow night, on Friday, go
Steers.

HOPE FOR VICTIMS OF HUMAN
TRAFFICKING
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to proudly announce the intro-
duction of a bipartisan bill to combat
human trafficking, the HOPE for Vic-
tims of Human Trafficking Act.
Too often, trafficking victims are
forced to do things that they would
never choose to do, and sometimes
they are forced by their captors to
break the law. This bill creates a legal
presumption which states that human
trafficking victims who commit a cov-
ered offense while being trafficked are
presumed to have committed that of-
fense under coercion unless the pros-
ecution can prove otherwise.
Consequently, this bill will stop
many unjust convictions human traf-
ficking victims face, which will then
better allow them to find employment,
seek additional education, and recover
from their trauma.
I am proud to cointroduce this bill
with my friend Representative ALCEE
HASTINGS.
On behalf of the many human traf-
ficking groups that supported the bill,
including Shared Hope International,
Rights4Girls, Selah Freedom, and oth-
ers, I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation, too.

Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, this

boards that come a little bit later.
They talk about our economic prom-
ises: Social Security, Medicare, certain
healthcare entitlements. The fact of
the matter is they consume every in-
cremental dollar. We will get to that.
But one of the reasons I am actually
starting with this board here is, this
week, I believe the Democrats actually
held what they call a Member Day with
the global warming or environmental
change committee. Forgive me for get-
ting the name wrong.
We weren’t able to be there because
we had Jay Powell and other people
here this week. But we wanted to come
here and actually start to share with
our brothers and sisters in this body
some of the amazing technology that is
here that I don’t know how to get indi-
viduals in this body who care about the
environment to start to understand.
We are living in the time of miracles.
We all saw last week, MIT had a major
breakthrough in ambient carbon cap-
ture; right? Okay. So the frustration is
that I will hear people get behind these
microphones and talk about how much
they care about global warming, how
much they care about greenhouse
gases, how much they care, and then
they don’t spend time reading miracles
that are happening in the technology.
This is technology that just came out
in a paper from MIT. They crashed the
cost of yanking carbon directly out of
the air.
b 1700
It is negative carbon capture. It is
ambient. It is basically, if you have a
generation source, let’s say you are a
concrete plant, a power generation—
this and that—you could actually be
using this. It uses shockingly little
electricity.
They basically came up with this
concept of: Let’s run these plates. Let’s
actually put nanotubes on it. We will
run a certain low voltage through
these plates, and it will catch the car-
bon in the air.
And it doesn’t matter. The tech-
nology doesn’t care whether you are at
1 part per 400 million or heavy carbon.
It is just an example of how technology
is about to provide us a revolution on
how we protect our environment. And
it is here.
How do we actually, as policymakers,
incentivize these technology break-
throughs to happen, and how do we get
these technology breakthroughs to be-
come part of our society?
It is not enough to come up here and
virtue signal, coming up behind these
microphones, telling us all how much
you care and then not to understand.
The revolution of technology is here,
that if you actually care about carbon
in the environment and its effects on
global warming, guess what? You have
just had a major, major breakthrough,
because can the U.S. stop China from
building its—what?—33 coal-fired
plants that are going up right now that
basically have no carbon capture? This
type of technology becomes part of the
solution.
I wish I could get our brothers and
sisters here to stop being sort of, shall
we say, antiscience and be willing to
keep up with the incredible progress we
are making in environmental science.
So this is a big deal for anyone who
is watching, anyone who is listening,
anyone who actually cares. Please,
grab your phone. Let’s Google ‘‘MIT
ambient carbon capture.’’ Look at the
graphics. They have a great little video
of how it works, a simple explanation
of how it works. This is a big deal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8871
November 14, 2019
What a lot of folks here don’t remem-
ber is, a year ago, the Republicans ac-
tually did something we call the Q45
tax credit. And we have been waiting
for the Treasury Department to finish
all the rules and the regs, but the con-
cept was: You are an energy producer.
If you would capture your carbon, we
will give you a tax credit. If you take
that carbon and then sequester it
someplace or turned it into other uses,
we will give you another credit.
Now, all of a sudden, we have the
cost breakthrough of capturing that
carbon. It is from a pure math stand-
point. This isn’t Republican or Demo-
crat. This should be hope and optimism
that, once again, sort of the
Malthusians in this place who thought
the only way we could ever accomplish
these things is crashing, just crashing
our economy, the end of use of hydro-
carbons. They are wrong.
We are going to walk through some
more of this, and you will see how this
will ultimately tie together, at least, I
hope you will.
So this is an example of the facility
in the current state of technology. This
is a facility that I believe is going up in
Canada right now. I believe the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation and others
are investing in it. This is sort of an
active type of carbon capture. They
thought they could get down to $100 a
ton, and we were all giddy about this.
The previous board may cut this price
in half.
This is a big deal, when we just had
not an incremental improvement, but a
major, major, major improvement in
what you call ambient air capture. It is
functionally mining the air and pulling
carbon out of it.
So let’s actually now think about fa-
cilities like this. This facility is up and
running outside Houston. It is a nat-
ural gas power plant, and it doesn’t
have a smokestack. They created
something—and I always screw this up.
I believe it is the Allam cycle.
This engineer had this idea for, ap-
parently, decades, this concept saying:
Okay. We burn the natural gas; we heat
steam; we take the steam; we turn the
turbines. Why not just blow up the nat-
ural gas, send the carbon from that,
smash it into the turbines, spin the
turbines, and then capture the CO2 on
the other side?
It works. It is up and running today,
and, apparently, it is incredibly effi-
cient. They are raising money. I think
they are going to dramatically increase
the size, but it is natural gas genera-
tion—no smokestack—and it works.
And guess what happens? On the
other end, they capture all the CO2,
and they use it for enhanced oil recov-
ery. They can sequester it in concrete
and other places or just stick it back
into the ground. But we know how to
do this because it is not a theory. It is
running today.
How much discussion, how much
praise, how much interest do we get on
this from our brothers and sisters here
who claim to care about the environ-
ment, the fact that we have had the en-
gineering breakthrough? Because it
doesn’t sort of fit the commanding con-
trol craziness that has become our en-
vironmental discussion here that we
must shut down any uses of these fossil
fuels, of these hydrocarbons.
Many of us are just trying to say: I
need you to open up your hearts and
your minds to science and the math.
We can demonstrate we can actually
use our energy and do it in a way where
we capture the very thing you were
most concerned about. It is here. It is
not theory. It is here. Let’s have just a
little moment of joy that science, once
again, ran faster than at least we
thought it would.
So the other thing, also, to walk
through, and I do this one just because
I am fascinated—and I have the micro-
phone. Earlier this year, we had a
major breakthrough in, I believe, tech-
nically, it is referred to as synthetic bi-
ology.
Does everyone remember their high
school biology class where we basically
learned, hey, you are a plant cell? And
since time immemorial, plant cells ac-
tually have an inherent inefficiency.
They really, really want that carbon
molecule so they can grow a sugar, and
the plant can grow. And then some-
times the plant cell, though, doesn’t
end up getting that carbon molecule. It
ends up grabbing an oxygen. And now
it has to spend all this time and energy
purging that.
I believe it is the University of Illi-
nois and a couple Federal agencies that
have been playing with this for awhile.
Because the original thought was:
Could we do some tweaking of plant bi-
ology so it would create a greater car-
bon synch?
Somewhere in that research, they hit
the holy grail, and that holy grail is
they can now make that plant always
grab the carbon molecule, so the plant
grows 40 percent more efficiently.
Well, think about, first, what does
that mean to society? What does that
mean to the world? Well, it means we
will probably feed the world for the
next couple hundred years.
It also means you need 40 percent
less land, 40 percent less water, 40 per-
cent less food, 40 percent less fertilizer.
It also means it is going to be disrup-
tive to the value of farmland; it is
going to be disruptive to agricultural
pricing; it is probably going to be dis-
ruptive to agricultural credit.
But it is here. It is technology. It is
coming.
It also means, all of a sudden, if you
are someone who particularly likes
biofuels, with this type of synthetic bi-
ology, did you just change the pricing
structures?
This is coming. The technology has
already succeeded in tobacco crops. We
use tobacco because that was the first
one we knew the genome of, and I be-
lieve now they are experimenting in a
number of row crops.
But, once again, there is an incred-
ible disruption coming to the world
brought by U.S. scientists that actu-
ally change everything.
And now I need you to think more
creatively. First, just the thought ex-
periment.
World agriculture is said to produce
2.2 times the greenhouse gases of every
car on Earth. Okay. If you are using
crops that had this technology associ-
ated with it so they grew 40 percent
more efficient, using these crops would
equal removing every car off the face
of the Earth and its greenhouse gases.
You just have to be willing to eat
something that technically is a GMO,
but the math equals removing every
car off the face of the Earth.
So, once again, the science is here.
We have had this amazing break-
through. It is the United States leading
the way.
But also, this technology can be used
for growing forests, changing the grass
in your ball fields, these other things.
It is here. We did it. And yet I see no
one else coming behind these micro-
phones to talk about the optimism.
If you care about the environment,
embrace, learn, listen, read, study, un-
derstand the scientific breakthroughs
that are here that make a difference.
I do this one just as a continuation of
the thought experiment: How many of
you live in a community? How many of
those of us here in D.C. live in a com-
munity where you are not allowed to
have a plastic straw? How many plastic
straws are in the ocean from North
America? Functionally, none. It is vir-
tue signaling. It is theater. We do this
to feel better that we care.
But if you actually cared, it turns
out the math will set you free. The
math says 90 percent of the plastic in
the ocean comes from 10 rivers: 8 in
Asia, 2 in Africa.
If you actually care about plastic in
the ocean, stop the virtue signaling
about straws that are in D.C., that are
never going to actually be in the ocean,
and start caring about the 90 percent of
the plastic that comes from 10 rivers.
And we know where they are.
Change foreign policy. Change our
environmental age. Change our tech-
nical assistance. Go to those 10 rivers.
Change it, and then remove 90 percent
of the plastic from the ocean instead of
just talking about it or having this
charity group or this NGO or raising
money off the issues and having no ac-
tual effect.
If you actually care, do something.
Don’t engage in the political theater
that makes you puff up your chest and
sound like you actually care. Help us.
Those of us on the Republican side, we
are working on trying to change those
foreign aids, the technical aids, the
technical assistance to do this. Help us
do it.
This shouldn’t be Republican. It
shouldn’t be Democrat. It is tech-
nology. We know where the plastic in
the ocean comes from. We have ideas
on how to add a value to this plastic so
it is collected, so it never ends up in
those rivers. Go to the source where

the problem is. Stop the crazy virtue
signaling about straws in your commu-
nity and help us go where 90 percent of
the plastic in the ocean comes from.
And I know I may be sounding a bit
sarcastic, but I am frustrated. We have
been actually sort of demonstrating
this one for a year, and I still can’t get
many of my brothers and sisters on the
left to say: Oh, God, that is right. It is
math. We know where it is. Let’s go
get it.
It makes no sense to me. Is it we are
going to take away a talking point, a
theatrical point? Help us actually
make—I love scuba diving. Before I got
this job, I used to actually get to spend
some time doing it.
Help us. Take credit for it. We just
want the right thing to happen, but it
is not virtue signaling. It is actually
going to where the problem actually is.
So let’s actually make a circle and
see if I can tie this in to what it means
to our future.
This is one of the things I have come
to this floor on for years, because we
are having the wrong discussion here.
We as a country are buried in debt, and
the debt is going to get dramatically
bigger.
First, we need to pull out our cal-
culators—for those who actually own
calculators here on Capitol Hill—and
have a moment of honesty.
The debt is substantially driven by
our demographics. It is not Republican
or Democrat; it is just what we are.
We have 74 million of us who are
baby boomers. Congress did not pay at-
tention that there were 74 million of us
who were going to turn 65 one day and
step into our earned entitlements.
So if you look at this chart right
now, 1965, you see the red area, it is 34
percent. That is what mandatory
spending was. That was everything
from entitlements you get, you earned.
You earned your Social Security. You
earned your Medicare. You earned your
veterans benefits.
There are some you get because you
are part of a Tribal group or some you
get because you fell under a certain in-
come.
Today, it is now crossing over 70 per-
cent of all of our spending is on for-
mula. When we stand on this floor and
vote for appropriations, we don’t even
vote on that red portion, that 70-plus
percent of our spending. We don’t even
vote on it. It is a formula.
And then what is remaining? Half of
it is defense. You see that little blue
area over there? That is the defense.
You see there the green? That is all
we really have.
And if you actually look at what we
call discretionary, nondefense discre-
tionary, it has been substantially flat
for the last 10 years. It is just math.
So if I come to you and say Social
Security, Medicare, healthcare entitle-
ments, just the growth from those over
the next 5 years, just the growth will
equal the spending of the Defense De-
partment. Let’s double it. Hey, every 10
years, we will add two full Defense De-
partments. And that is just the growth
of Social Security, Medicare,
healthcare entitlements.
We know where the problem is, but it
is terrifying for elected officials to
speak about it, talk about it, even
think about it, because you have to ex-
plain something. It is hard, but it is
manageable if we do everything.
And the very last board I am going to
show is, once again, our sort of holistic
approach of, if we pull all the levers,
we have done the math, we think we
can keep it at 95 percent of debt to
GDP, this isn’t the absurd untruthful
conversations that we are going to pay
off the debt, because every day 10,300 of
us turn 65. We need to deal with the
truth about the math.
And the math isn’t Republican or
Democrat. It is math.
b 1715
So, first off, the number one pillar we
have to engage in—because it makes
everything else possible—is a robust, a
powerful, strong economic growth, the
robustness of the economy, the partici-
pation in the labor force.
We must do everything possible,
whether it be changes in the Tax Code,
whether it be changes in trade, wheth-
er it be changes in going to smart,
crowd-sourced type of technology-
based regulation. We must grow.
Growth is moral.
Because, if we don’t grow, you can’t
make any of the other math work. And
this is the reality.
So, how many of my brothers and sis-
ters came behind these microphones
when we did tax reform and told us the
world was coming to an end—except for
the fact that we, just last month, got
the revenues. Excuse me. They are
called receipts. Total receipts into the
Federal Government: turns out to be
the highest ever. We grew over 5 per-
cent in our receipts in a post tax re-
form world.
We had a parade of economists from
the left come and tell us this could not
happen, but it happened. How about
that parade of economists from the left
who came to us and told us we were
going to force ourselves into a reces-
sion? It didn’t happen.
How about those who said, hey, you
guys can never get back into the 60-
plus, 61, 62, 63 percent labor force par-
ticipation, but it has happened.
You could never have a society with
more jobs than available workers, but
it has happened.
You could never possibly see, like we
did in 2018, unmarried women with no
partner at home having a 7.6 percent
rise in their incomes, but it happened.
You could never cut the poverty rate
a full half a percent in a single year,
but we did it.
You would think things like that
would bring joy in this body, joy across
the country. We have an economy that
is working. We had Jay Powell here
yesterday, the Federal Reserve chair-
man, talking about we are in a sweet
spot. It is working. The most stable
economy in modern times. The health-
iest labor market in modern times. The
best employment situation in modern
times.
The debates we should be having be-
hind these microphones should be
about how not to screw it up, how to
understand what is working and do
more of it.
Because, you remember the previous
slide that talked about the growth of
debt, where our allocations go? If we
grow the economy, it gives us a fight-
ing chance. Now, we still have to do a
bunch of other things.
And this is back to the ultimate
point. I have been trying to argue now
for multiple years: There is a path
where we don’t have to be buried in a
financial collapse as a society because
we built up stunning amounts of debt.
And I know some don’t want to hear it,
but it is the math.
We believe we have built the math
that we could kiss up against 95 per-
cent of debt to GDP and hold it
through the baby boomers.
I have a 4-year-old little girl. She de-
serves to live in an America that
works, that grows, that provides oppor-
tunities. Remember, we are in a world
right now where, if we can keep up this
level of growth, about every 30, 35
years the standard of living doubles. Or
we go back to the bad old days of just
a couple of years ago where the GDP
growth was so slow and so fat, the
standard of living was only going to
double about every 70 years.
So, how do we do this? I just walked
through, first, our financial levers that
are solely responsible for us in this
room. We own the levers. We own the
levers of tax policy that grow the econ-
omy. We own the levers of immigration
policy that goes to a talent-based sys-
tem, that maximizes economic growth.
We own the levers with the administra-
tion on smart regulations. We own the
levers, ultimately, on trade agreements
that are fair and grow our economy.
But we have to do other things. We
have to change many of our social enti-
tlement structures to incentivize work.
If you are on Social Security dis-
ability, don’t create a cliff; create a
glide path so you are incentivized to be
in the labor force. Because, think
about it. When the models were done
after we did tax reform, the fragility—
the smart economists kept coming to
us saying: Our capital stock. Will there
be enough money to finance the
growth?
It turns out, there is. We did it.
Americans are saving. Some of that is
demographics. Some of it is substan-
tially because of tax reform.
It turns out, repatriation, we had—
what was the report?—$140 billion more
come back than we expected. And it
turns out, because we have a healthy
economy, capital is coming in from all
over the world. So we have the capital
to invest and grow.
But the other fragility was labor,
available workers. What a great prob-
lem to have, but we need to think of

every lever we have in society, every-
thing from dealing with the opioid cri-
sis to incentives to participate in the
labor force.
Come to Phoenix, Arizona. We have a
homeless shelter. There is an organiza-
tion there called St. Joseph The Work-
er. It is a 100-year-old-plus Catholic
charity. You walk in the door, and they
will show you—they have a stack of job
opportunities for the most disaffected
of our society, people who are trying to
get on their program, trying to deal
with mental health demons and sub-
stance abuse demons and those things.
But they are there.
There should be joy that there is
such a labor shortage that our brothers
and sisters in the business community
are willing to take a risk on our broth-
ers and sisters who are living in a
homeless shelter. That part, we have
proven, works.
How do we expand participation in
the labor force? How do we also, now,
incentivize the other end? If you are
healthy, if you are fit, if you are sharp,
if you just want to, do we actually
start to say: Well, you are 72 years old.
You want to work. We are going to
start adding certain levels of taxes. We
are going to start taking away parts of
your Social Security. We are going to
tax these benefits because you are out
there working.
Just the opposite. We want as much
of our society to stay in the labor
force. And if you want to and you are
older, let’s redesign some of these in-
centives to stay in the labor force.
Our millennial males that we still
have a math problem entering the
labor force and the other end of the age
curve—let’s fix it. Those are policies. Is
that Republican or Democrat? It is just
rational policy to keep the economy
growing.
The other one that I come to the
floor constantly and speak about is the
disruption of technology that is about
to crash the price of healthcare. And
this is one of those moments I seem to
succeed in offending everyone, so
maybe it is the right thing.
The ACA, ObamaCare—let’s have a
moment of truth and reality about it.
It was substantially a finance mecha-
nism. It was about who got subsidized,
who had to pay.
Our Republican alternative, well-
meaning, had a number of kickers, a
number of incentives in it, but it
wasn’t about who got subsidized and
who had to pay; it was substantially
about who had to pay and who got sub-
sidized.
This body needs to stop having the
absurd conversation about the financ-
ing part of healthcare and start think-
ing about what we do to crash the ac-
tual delivery price.
It turns out there is a revolution of
technology out there, the thing you
can blow into that can actually tell
you you have the flu. It can bounce off
your phone, check your medical
records, and then order antivirals. Ex-
cept for, the problem is, that tech-
nology is illegal under the way our
laws are written today.
There is a revolution coming. The
other side of the spectrum is drugs like
the single-shot cure for hemophilia.
You saw that we think we now have
the cure for sickle cell anemia. On cys-
tic fibrosis, it looks like we think we
may have the drug that stabilizes it.
We know we have the drug that sta-
bilizes ALS.
They are all going to be really expen-
sive. These are miracles in the biologic
pharmaceutical world. We need to now
work on a financing mechanism for the
distribution of these pharmaceuticals
that cure our brothers and sisters with
chronic conditions. Because, remem-
ber, 5 percent of our population with
chronic conditions is the majority of
our healthcare spending.
And we are about to start curing a
number of them, because a few years
ago the Republicans in this body, we
passed the Cures Act, and it is work-
ing.
And my terror is the left is moving a
bill called H.R. 3. It made it through
the Ways and Means Committee, and it
breaks my heart because they are
about to screw up the very incentives
that have created these miracles, that
are about to start curing individuals
with these chronic conditions.
Understand, if we could get our act
together, if we could actually start to
understand the technology disruption
that is here, we can start to crash the
price of healthcare, instead of having
the absurd debate of who should get
subsidized and who should have to pay.
Is that Republican or Democrat? It is
just technology.
But when you work in an environ-
ment where rage is the actual com-
modity of exchange, how do you ever
actually get to solutions?
And then the last one, which will be
the most difficult one, is we have to
have an honest conversation of what to
do in the actual incentives, are there
things we could do in the incentives of
staying healthy, of how you deliver
Medicare and Medicare part A and B
and D, the incentives there.
Could we actually create some incen-
tives for Social Security that, if you
wanted to work longer, you get spiffs
and those things?
But, if we do those five things, we
can make the math work that we as a
society, we as a country do not have to
fall off the debt cliff. And it is the
hardest thing you can imagine for a
body that is completely calcified in its
inability to actually do anything of
value. Because it would require owning
a calculator; it would require thinking;
it would require some creativity; and it
would require doing everything at one
time to make the math work.
You can’t just do one of these things,
walk away, and pretend you did some-
thing. It all has a synergistic feed be-
cause the labor force participation
needs the strong economy; the strong
economy needs the investments for the
technology; the technology disruption
needs the strong labor force to grab
those who may have been rotated in
the economy. It all has to work to-
gether.
My heartbreak as I come behind this
microphone and the reason I am here is
to save this country and save it from
that huge monster that is our debt, be-
cause I have the world’s greatest little
4-year-old girl, and I am going to find
a way to fix this for my country, but
also for my daughter.
I have been coming behind this
microphone now with this for over a
year. We have meeting after meeting
after meeting after meeting on the fact
that there is a path. It requires being
willing to accept disruption in tech-
nology. It requires being able to actu-
ally drop some of the crazy ideology
and actually use a calculator on the
math on the things that actually grow
the economy.
And the ideology of rage has blinded
us from, I think, in many ways, doing
the right thing for working men and
women, for my little girl, for this coun-
try.
And I don’t care if you are on the
right or the left; you should be having
your soul ripped out because we are
now—we have been here, what, 10-plus
months, and we have squandered al-
most every day we have been here be-
cause we know the path we have to go
down, yet, in many ways, all we have
done is make it worse.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

this ongoing issue, ongoing for only
about 3 years, because it was imme-
diately upon President Trump being
elected President that we immediately
started hearing all of the saber-rattling
that we have got to impeach this guy,
he is not qualified, he is crazy, he has
committed crimes.
And we have been hearing for nearly
3 years: there is no question, there is
lots of direct evidence, President
Trump has committed crimes, a lot
more than you might think; in fact, a
lot more than circumstantial evidence.
Oh, it is overwhelming.
We have heard from so many people
for nearly 3 years—well, actually, over
3 years now—over 3 years.
Then we get down to it. The great
hope was the man that I believe did
more damage to the FBI than all of the
FBI directors for the last 50 years, a
guy named Mueller.

He ran off thousands and thousands
of years of our best FBI experience. Ap-
parently, he just wanted yes-people. He
didn’t want people who had enough ex-
perience to tell him when he was on
the wrong track.
He said he had no reason to apologize
when he destroyed the lives of innocent
people. And yet, that is the person who
was put in charge of this investigation.
What did he do? He went out and
hired over a dozen people who abso-
lutely despise Donald Trump, put them
to work trying to destroy our sitting
President. They harassed him and his
family, business associates, people in
the administration, threatened their
families, threatened them.
Even after all that, after virtually 2
years, nearly 2 years of investigation
by the Mueller cabal, they had nothing.
They had nothing. I think Mueller
would have been happy to keep inves-
tigating and using up millions and mil-
lions of taxpayer dollars, tens of mil-
lions, as he had been doing. Fortu-
nately, his investigation came to an
end.
After thousands of witnesses, they
had nothing. No Russia collusion. A
hoax is what it turned out to be.
When it was clear there was no Rus-
sia collusion—of course, it is not a
crime to collude. It is a crime to con-
spire.
There was no Russian conspiracy be-
tween anybody with the Trump cam-
paign and the Russians. But it is very
clear, the Russians, what they really
wanted, for people who have really dug
into this, they wanted and what they
always want, always have wanted, back
when it was the Soviet Union, they
want to divide America. They want to
destroy this Republic.
Unfortunately, they found allies,
willing or otherwise, here in this coun-
try, to take absolute lies that were cre-
ated, were spun up, were twisted—had
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act court, the FISA court, manipu-
lated fraud upon the FISA court, which
has exposed to me, as a former judge
and chief justice, that since we have
seen nothing from the FISA court of
outrage, as a good judge should have
when they realized there has been a
fraud upon the court, nothing, which
tells me we either need to totally get
rid of the FISA court or we need to
have some dramatic changes.
We certainly need to change the
FISA judges themselves because either
they were unwilling and unknowing ac-
complices with the fraud upon the
court, or they knew what was going on
and he or she, or they, were proud to
play a part in trying to destroy the
Trump campaign and the Trump Presi-
dency.
I think it is interesting, this call be-
tween President Trump and President
Zelensky, July 25, I mean, when so
many people—we find out now so many
people were on the call, including at
least four stenographers taking down
every word.
I mean, I have been in courts for my
whole adult life, and you might have a
stenographer miss a word here and
there. They are amazing. They hardly
ever make mistakes. But if you have
four stenographers sitting on a call,
you are not going to have four stenog-
raphers miss anything when they con-
sult each other and work together.
That is just not going to happen.
I had one of the best court reporters
in the world, and, you know, there was
a mistake now and then.
You put four people like that to-
gether, like we are taking down the
President and President Zelensky’s
call, and they don’t make mistakes.
But it had to send shivers up the
spines of anybody in our intelligence
community that had worked with
Ukrainians, Russians, former MI–6,
Italians, Australians to try to destroy
President Trump. It had to send shiv-
ers up their spine. It had to get them
very concerned.
Oh, my gosh. This President is going
to close in on us because this new
President, we understand he is honest.
That is what we keep hearing, that he
wants to end corruption in Ukraine.
This whole body, I think there were
maybe 10 or 12 or so that didn’t vote for
the bill in 2014 that talks about Russia,
I mean—not Russia, but Ukrainian cor-
ruption, and how we need to push them
to end that corruption. So, I mean, ev-
erybody on this floor basically knows.
And I think the ‘‘no’’ votes were based
on some other reason, not on a desire
not to end corruption. We all had the
same goal, just concerns about dif-
ferent parts.
The fact is, people know. There has
been a lot of corruption. It sounds like
President Zelensky wants to end it.
You put that with a President who
doesn’t mind rattling cages and trying
to drain the swamp and trying to
change the way we do things for the
better, and of course, it offends those
whether they say they are part of the
deep state or not. It is the people that
work here that have never been elected
here but think they run this country,
and those in embassies who, beyond
what they are assigned to do, they
think they run foreign policy. We have
gotten a taste of that through these
hearings and through these witnesses
and through their testimony.
The star witness yesterday, Mr. Tay-
lor, I don’t impugn his military serv-
ice, but I know if he had been the kind
of gossipmonger in the Army or at
West Point that he has turned into at
the State Department, he sure
wouldn’t have gone very far. His next
OER in the Army would have destroyed
his career. In West Point, he would
have gotten the lowest peer review rat-
ings. He would not have done very well
at all.
This is, apparently, a different Mr.
Taylor than the one that went through
West Point and served honorably and
well in the Army.
But as Ambassador Sondland testi-
fied, and our friend JIM JORDAN read
yesterday, Ambassador Taylor recalls,
and this is Sondland’s testimony, that
Tim Morrison told Ambassador Taylor
that Sondland ‘‘told Mr. Morrison that
I conveyed this message to Yermak on
September 1, 2019, in connection with
Vice President PENCE’s visit to Warsaw
and a meeting with President
Zelensky.’’
Astounding. That is where Mr. Tay-
lor says he got his clear understanding
of what had happened.
If you look at his testimony, you get
a real sense of how this honorable serv-
ing military member, fine graduate of
West Point, has been tainted over the
years.
You look at his testimony, first of
all, he says something like—he an-
swered a question. He had never seen
aid conditioned on political interests.
And yet, what he probably had in his
mind is he had never seen aid condi-
tioned on something he disagreed with.
Most of our aid is conditioned on
something. If it is not, we need to find
it and get conditions on it.
As I have said ever since I have been
here, you don’t have to pay people to
hate you. They will do it for free. And
yet, our country continues to pay dic-
tators that hate us.
That stuff ought to be stopped. It
ought to be conditioned on making
those countries less corrupt. That is
what this House has tried to do on both
sides of the aisle, in prior years, to end
corruption in Ukraine.
But you get a sense of things when—
this is his testimony, at page 11, Mr.
Taylor’s. Let’s see. ‘‘The first summary
of the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call
that I heard from anybody inside the
U.S. Government was during a phone
call I had with Tim Morrison, Dr. Hill’s
recent replacement at the NSC, on
July 28.’’
That is what Ambassador Sondland
was apparently talking about. He got
that from Tim Morrison, who conveyed
a message that Yermak got from Am-
bassador Sondland about Vice Presi-
dent PENCE’s visit to Warsaw and meet-
ing with President Zelensky.
He goes on, and his next statement,
next paragraph: ‘‘By August, I was be-
coming more concerned.’’
Yeah, Mr. Taylor was becoming con-
cerned because he had heard fourth-
hand the President wanted to end some
corruption in Ukraine that was affect-
ing the United States election.
I thought that is what everybody
here wanted to do. That is what we
have been hearing from the leftwing, or
many call it the mainstream, but the
leftwing, alt-left media. They have
been saying, oh, how horrible.
Well, here you have a President try-
ing to do something about it, and Mr.
Taylor, the wonderful, honorably serv-
ing Army man, is now concerned be-
cause of the fourth-hand account he
got about what the President did.
Now, we are told: Oh, by the way, I
heard about a staffer who overheard a
conversation between the Ambassador
and the President, and he mentioned

the interviews, had some question
about the interviews, maybe how they
were going.
Oh, my goodness. The investigation,
wanted to know how it was going. Gee,
how horrible that we had a President
who wanted to know about corruption
in Ukraine that was affecting the
United States.
Then we get down—and I think this
tells us a great deal about their star
witness, until his staffer, who was
eavesdropping and heard a conversa-
tion, we are told, when Mr. Taylor
says, ‘‘A formal U.S. request to the
Ukrainians to conduct an investigation
based on violations of their own law
struck me as improper.’’
Well, my understanding was the
President wants to know about corrup-
tion in Ukraine that may have violated
American law, our laws, work with our
U.S. Attorney General to try to get to
the bottom of not Ukraine, per se, but
Ukrainians’ effort to affect our elec-
tion.
That offends these deep staters in the
State Department, these people that
don’t like a President that doesn’t see
things exactly like they do. How dare
this President come in and want to
exert his foreign policy that he got
elected to put in place. He doesn’t un-
derstand. We are the ones that run
things.
You see it here. He says that ‘‘struck
me as improper.’’ I am the judge, the
purveyor of what is right or not in my
realm.
You find that in a number of people
in the State Department. We run
things.
Of course, they come in and testify.
‘‘I have worked for this many Presi-
dents, carried out their foreign policy.’’
Then we find out that what means. ‘‘I
carry out their foreign policy as long
as they do what I tell them. Or I ignore
them and carry out what I know is
much better.’’ You get that sense.
He goes on: ‘‘And I recommended to
Ambassador Volker we ‘stay clear’’’ be-
cause I, Mr. Taylor, know much better
than the elected President. I know bet-
ter than the Attorney General.
b 1745
I know better than all of these
clowns who are elected or have been
confirmed by the Senate. Who are they
to go around what I think?
And he goes on: ‘‘To find out the
legal aspects of the question, however,
I gave him,’’ the Ambassador, ‘‘the
name of a deputy assistant attorney
general, whom I thought would be the
proper point of contact for seeking a
U.S. request for a foreign investiga-
tion.’’
How dare President Trump try to go
around the way I, Mr. Taylor, think
that foreign affairs ought to be handled
and the way corruption ought to be ad-
dressed when it affects the United
States? How dare he? I am the one who
knows these things, not this clown
President.
I mean, it is pretty clear what was in
his mind, and it needs to stop.
And I would just suggest, if we have
a vote to send this matter of impeach-
ment, actually impeach this President
for violating the sense of propriety of
somebody who is so deep in the state
and in the intel that they don’t like
somebody coming in trying to drain
the swamp, if that is what they want to
impeach this President over, trying to
end corruption in Ukraine that affects
our election, well, then, the Senate, I
know some have said, ‘‘Oh, we are not
going to have a vote on that,’’ well, I
imagine they probably will, and they
are going to need to have a trial.
In looking back and researching this
again, you know, there are no rules of
evidence for impeachment; there are no
rules of procedure. The Constitution
provides for it, the impeachment trial
in the Senate. But as I understand it,
the Senate may have even gone to the
Old Senate Chamber to have a session
out from under C–SPAN cameras to
work out the rules of evidence and pro-
cedure, limit time, limit witnesses,
how questions are asked, all that. They
have to come up with that every im-
peachment, a new set of rules.
I would point to Article III, Section 3
for a little bit of guidance here.
Article III, Section 3 talks about
treason, and President Trump is not
guilty of any treason. He is not being
accused of treason, except from people
who are suffering from PTSD. That is
President Trump stress disorder. But
otherwise, there will be no charge of
treason against this President, because
it didn’t happen.
But it is such an important issue
when you talk about removing a duly
elected President for the first time in
our history. And there is a rule on trea-
son. It is in the Constitution: ‘‘No per-
son shall be convicted of treason unless
on the testimony of two witnesses to
the same overt act.’’ That means direct
evidence, no hearsay, two people who
actually witnessed this despicable act.
I would submit to the Senate that re-
moving a President properly duly
elected for the first time in our his-
tory, even after there were Ukrainians
and Russians trying to help the Demo-
crats to keep him from being elected—
he still won, got a huge majority of the
electoral college votes. This would be
every bit as serious as charging some-
one with treason. The Senate ought to
set a rule that says: We have got to
have two direct witnesses to whatever
they are saying he did wrong. We are
not going to take hearsay to remove a
President for the first time.
I would suggest that if the Senate
would do that, they won’t even have to
worry about setting time deadlines,
witness deadlines. Just put that re-
quirement on, and it will be a very
short trial because there are no direct
witnesses of any allegation that would
rise to the level of what is being ac-
cused here.
MILITARY PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN TREATED
UNFAIRLY
Mr. GOHMERT. Now I want to turn
quickly to the issue of some of our
United States military personnel who
have been unfairly treated, people who
saw it as their patriotic duty to sign up
and serve this country, risk their lives
and limbs and their life as a family
member to serve this country.
Greater love hath no one, Jesus told
us, that they would be willing to lay
down their lives for their friends, and
that is what these people do.
My group, my 4 years on Active
Duty, we were never sent to combat,
but we have, currently, a Secretary of
the Department of Defense who is try-
ing to stop efforts and came out and
publicly—basically threatened the
President, don’t you dare try to right
what you think are wrongs in people
who I would tell you have been rail-
roaded by a broken military justice
system.
The reason Congress created the
UCMJ, where military members don’t
even get all the rights that we give to
terrorists, to foreign terrorists ille-
gally in our country—we don’t give our
military as many rights as they have.
The reason we had to shortcut, or
Congress did, back when the UCMJ was
passed was because both sides of the
aisle understood that, when you are in
a combat theater, you don’t have time
to go back and have a thorough inves-
tigation, gather up all the forensic evi-
dence and then come back and have a
nice jury trial in America. You have
got to deal with it quickly and then get
back on the battlefield.
And yet what we have seen over and
over, when the military chooses for po-
litical expedience or political correct-
ness purposes or when they want to
satisfy a terrible leader like Maliki
was in Iraq who created all kinds of
trouble for that country, we would send
a Vice President over to stand by him
and say we are going to get these guys,
or tell Karzai, a corrupt family in Af-
ghanistan, oh, yes, we are going to
prosecute our guys who, turned out,
killed people who created IEDs that
killed Americans, people who were
Taliban trying to kill Americans, and
yet we have hung some of our own peo-
ple out to dry.
So we have a letter, a bunch of us do.
It should go out in the morning, I
guess, to the Defense Secretary, and,
you know, I put the words in there my-
self that I think, if he doesn’t realize
that there needs to be some corrections
within military justice so we don’t
keep sending innocent people defending
our country, defending their brothers
and sisters on the battlefield, if we
don’t stop sending them to prison and
bring them back to America for a trial,
don’t allow the defendant to bring wit-
nesses back from the combat theater,
oh, no, but the CID and our officials
will make deals with Taliban or with
people in Iraq who want to destroy our
country and us, if they will come over
and say terrible things about our mili-
tary member, we will put them in pris-
on, and we will give them visas.
And that happened with Sergeant
Derrick Miller. We got a whole bunch
of people.

Clint Lorance, hoping that the Presi-
dent will act. Apparently got slowed
down by the Defense Secretary jump-
ing in.
John Hatley, a first sergeant, two
bronze stars, He should have gotten a
silver star, but that was apparently
pulled as a recommendation.
Michael Behenna, Corey Clagett, we
have got a whole bunch of folks, and we
have a Congressional Justice for War-
riors Caucus here that is working on
this.
And we have got a guy who recog-
nized a Taliban member from the day
before when he had his AK–47 and
grabbed him in the middle of our U.S.
Army camp in Afghanistan and starts
questioning him, and he starts lying
through the interpreter: Oh, I was here
to fix electrical. Oh, no, I was here to
fix plumbing.
And that sergeant pulled his gun and
demanded answers. The guy grabs for
the gun and, in the struggle, the
Taliban member was shot. That ser-
geant was brought back to America.
The translator, who they told separate
stories—I mean, they told separate sto-
ries, but it was the same story told sep-
arately.
Yet, after the CID got through prom-
ising or somebody promising this guy
that had been trying to get a visa into
America and turned down every time:
If you will come to America and testify
that the Taliban member never
grabbed his gun, then we will give you
and your family visas; you will prob-
ably be able to get citizenship.
Oh, okay, then that is my story now,
he never tried to grab the gun.
And you threaten another witness
who was there, he is going to prison if
you don’t turn around and change what
you have said from the very beginning
without any influence from Sergeant
Miller, and you put the guy in prison
for premeditated murder?
You don’t have the weapon? Oh, no,
you don’t let him have the weapon.
You don’t have it examined so that it
can show that the fingerprints of the
Taliban member were on that gun, he
did try to grab it. And he is sentenced
for premeditated murder for the rest of
his life.
Well, we got that turned around. We
got it paroled, and thank God we did.
He is one of the finest people I have
ever known, Sergeant Derrick Miller
here, working for me now, and he is
working for our caucus.
We have a system that is broken, and
we need to fix it. And if our Secretary
of Defense doesn’t recognize that, he
needs to go, and we need to take the
money that we have allowed them to
use to drag people back to America,
away from the combat field, away from
juries that have combat experience, we
need to put them on trial in a civil
Federal court and let them have all the
rights and privileges they should have
as American citizens.
If you are not going to do it in the
combat theater the proper way with
the proper investigation, let’s bring
them back. Use your money from de-
fense. Use that not in courts-martial
but here in the United States in a civil
court, and that will solve the problem.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

RECOGNIZING SALEM MEDICAL
CENTER
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, today
I want to acknowledge the Salem Med-
ical Center, as they recently celebrated
100 years of service to the south Jersey
community.
The medical center has been a staple
of the area since its creation and has
evolved over time to meet the chang-
ing needs of Salem County.
Salem Medical Center offers cutting-
edge hospital services and a wide array
of outpatient programs to ensure the
people of south Jersey have access to
the healthcare they need. The center
has also been expanding in recent
years, thus providing patients with
more advanced technology and higher
quality care.
I want to thank the Salem Medical
Center for their reliable service to
south Jersey for the past 100 years and
hope they continue to flourish in
Salem County for 100 more. Their
nurses, their doctors, their technicians,
all of their employees are our heroes.
May God bless them.

S6579
Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2019 No. 182
Senate
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal Father, the source of light
and life, we praise Your Holy Name.
Because of You, we live and move and
have our being. Remind us that we are
not adequate for our daily task with-
out Your strength and abiding pres-
ence.
Lord, empower our Senators this day
to think clearly, speak wisely, and live
faithfully. May they strive to do their
best and then leave the results to You.
Eternal God, we are trusting You to
fulfill Your purposes for our Nation
and world.
We pray in Your powerful Name.
Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1
minute as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, a
5-year decline in farm income, retalia-
tory tariffs on U.S. ag commodities,
disrupted renewable biofuel policies,
devastating natural disasters, and now
shortages of LP gas needed to dry har-
vested grain add to the growing bur-
dens weighing heavily on the minds of
Iowans and American farmers.
Mounting pressure to pay the bills,
to get the crops out, and to make ends
meet can be overwhelming. We have
lately expressed lots of worries and
pressures that come from the increase
in farm bankruptcies and the increase
in rural and farm suicides.
There are many uncertainties in
farming that are beyond human con-
trol, but there are other areas where
Congress can help. As a farmer and as
a Senator representing the No. 1 agri-
cultural State, I am fighting to build
mental health resources—as an exam-
ple, there is the Grassley-Tester bill to
help preempt suicides—to uphold the
RFS by fighting with the EPA, and to
pass the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement.
These are issues that are tops on the
minds of Iowans and not just the farm-
ers.
I yield the floor.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
while our Senate Democratic col-
leagues continue blocking this body
from considering funding for our
Armed Forces, the Senate has taken
advantage of the time to confirm more
of President Trump’s well-qualified
nominees for Federal service, as well as
the judiciary.
Yesterday, we confirmed Chad Wolf
to serve at the Department of Home-
land Security. Following President
Trump’s decision to designate him Act-
ing Secretary, he is now heading up the
Department.
I want to take a moment to thank
the outgoing Acting DHS Secretary,
Kevin McAleenan. His tenure leading
the Department of Homeland Security
capped off a distinguished career in
public service, including nearly two
decades rising through the ranks of the
Customs and Border Patrol.
His leadership at DHS saw significant
progress in mitigating major aspects of
our border security and humanitarian
crisis, a strong focus on cyber security,
and hard work to strengthen the De-
partment all across the board. So I
thank the outgoing Acting Secretary
for his years in public service and, par-
ticularly, for his leadership in this re-
cent chapter.
Now, today, we will vote on the con-
firmation of Steven Menashi to the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr.
Menashi won majority support on the
Judiciary Committee on the basis of
strong academic and legal qualifica-
tions—degrees from Dartmouth and
Stanford, clerkships on the appellate
level and the Supreme Court, and expe-
rience in both teaching and practicing
law.
I would urge all of our colleagues to
vote to confirm this impressive nomi-
nee this afternoon.
f
NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
as my colleagues know, I have no
qualms about spending floor time on
the personnel business. Our Democratic
colleagues have made it necessary by
subjecting this President’s nominees to
unprecedented, systematic delays and
obstruction. The majority has been
willing to do things the hard way. We
are giving the American people the
government they voted for, as chosen
by the President they elected.
My Republican colleagues and I wish
that we could also be spending floor
time on productive, bipartisan legisla-
tion that the American people need to
actually become law. We want to pass
the USMCA and the 176,000 new Amer-
ican jobs it would create, but Speaker
PELOSI continues to block it. The far
left objects to their passing anything—
anything—that the President likes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6580 November 14, 2019
We want to pass a conference report
for the NDAA, critical legislation for
our national defense. Congress has
passed a bipartisan NDAA every single
year since 1961. Now it is another cas-
ualty of the impeachment obsession.
House Democrats steamrolled Repub-
licans in order to pass a wholly par-
tisan bill. I believe this may be the
first time ever that either Chamber has
passed a purely partisan NDAA. Now
they are stalling the conference com-
mittee and jeopardizing the whole
process.
We want to pass the defense funding
bill that our Democratic colleagues
have now filibustered twice so that our
servicemembers and commanders get
what they need. Back in the summer,
the Republican and Democratic leaders
in the House and Senate all agreed and
all signed onto an agreement with
President Trump—a bicameral, bipar-
tisan agreement. Everybody signed it.
We brokered this deal to make sure the
appropriations process did not—did
not—get bogged down with bickering
over policy issues. We all agreed to
keep poison pills out so that govern-
ment funding could move forward.
But just a few months later, our
Democratic colleagues are now insist-
ing on exactly the kinds of poison pills
they foreswore when they signed onto
the agreement this summer. They are
holding up funding for our men and
women in uniform because they dis-
agree with the President’s views on
border security. They want to chip
away at the exact Presidential authori-
ties that they specifically agreed not
to be touched. Let me say that again.
They want to chip away at the exact
Presidential authorities that they spe-
cifically agreed not to be touched. In
short, my friends in Democratic leader-
ship smelled an opportunity to pick a
political fight.
Our servicemembers need their fund-
ing. American workers and small busi-
nesses need their new trade deal. Our
Armed Forces need the authorizing leg-
islation that has been a bipartisan
slam dunk every year for almost 60
years—60 years.
We cannot cease all legislation just
because Democrats would rather fight
with the President. We will not neglect
the business of the American people
just because a House committee is
holding some public hearing. If they
are going to keep plowing ahead with
their impeachment obsession, they
cannot abdicate their basic govern-
ment responsibilities at the very same
time.
f
ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
now, on another matter, last Tuesday
was election day in dozens of States
and localities, including in my home
State of Kentucky. There was one im-
portant aspect of election day that
didn’t get much attention. Unlike in
2016, last week’s elections were not
marred to the same extent by foreign
interference from our Nation’s adver-
saries, and neither were the 2018 mid-
term elections last year.
As of now, there are no reports of for-
eign intrusion into voter records and
no reports of significant and successful
disinformation efforts on social media
or anywhere else. By any reasonable
standard and by all available evidence,
the past two elections have gone a
whole lot more smoothly than back in
2016.
Now, this wasn’t for lack of trying.
Russia and our other adversaries have
tried for decades to interfere in our
politics and to undermine the com-
petence of the American people in our
democracy, and they will not likely let
up anytime soon. This fight is nowhere
near over. But make no mistake, our
defenses are a whole lot stronger.
A massive coordinated effort to con-
front this threat has brought together
the Congress, the Trump administra-
tion, all 50 States, the private sector,
and more than 2,000 local jurisdictions.
We have worked to address the weak-
nesses Russia sought to exploit during
the Obama administration and have
proactively strengthened our defenses.
Last week, the Attorney General, the
Secretary of Defense, the Acting Home-
land Security Secretary, the acting
DNI, and the heads of the FBI, the
NSA, the U.S. Cyber Command, and the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Secu-
rity Agency issued a statement. Here is
what it said:
Election security is a top priority. . . . In
an unprecedented level of coordination, the
U.S. government is working with all 50
states and U.S. territories, local officials,
and private sector partners to identify
threats, broadly share information, and pro-
tect the democratic process.
Now, I know my colleagues already
know about these significant efforts
thanks to the groundwork laid by the
Intelligence Committee’s painstaking
investigation. We know about it be-
cause we have provided $380 million to
help modernize State election systems.
Back in September, I cosponsored an
amendment in committee that will
bring the total to more than $600 mil-
lion.
We know about the progress because
we have had a bipartisan, all-Members
briefing from administration experts.
Senators literally broke into applause
in appreciation for what the adminis-
tration was doing to protect our elec-
tion. The story is not finished. The cru-
cial work continues, but the progress is
undeniable.
No longer is threat intelligence
siloed within the Federal Government.
This administration has moved to
share vital information systematically
with everyone, from States and local-
ities to social media companies. No
longer is interference cost-free for ad-
versaries. The administration has sanc-
tioned and prosecuted Russians en-
gaged in election interference and
issued an Executive order that paves
the way for additional sanctions on
those who seek to interfere.
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity now runs a National Cybersecurity
and Communications Integration Cen-
ter—a physical war room of sorts—on
election day for sharing information
and coordinating action. That is along
with an online platform that 200 juris-
dictions reportedly tapped into last
week.
Long before election day, this admin-
istration was connecting with all 50
States and more than 2,000 localities to
deploy new cyber security tools, new
training for election workers, and to
provide threat alerts, and the list goes
on and on.
Our adversaries are still at the door,
but for two election days in a row now,
we have benefitted from stronger de-
fenses. Progress like this should earn
bipartisan applause. Like I said, behind
closed doors, it did, but in public our
Democratic colleagues have not loudly
cheered the successes. Instead, they are
trying to use the very serious issue of
election security to repackage their
long-held liberal view that Washington,
DC, needs far more power over elec-
tions.
Look, nobody really believes that all
the partisan proposals from Speaker
PELOSI and company are some kind of
tailored response to Russian meddling,
not when they transparently serve the
same goals the Democrats have wanted
since way before 2016.
For goodness’ sake, the New York
Times was editorializing for federal-
izing elections right after election day
2012, even when they liked the out-
come. That was the same election
cycle, by the way, in which President
Obama mocked—mocked—his Repub-
lican opponent for being too tough on
Russia.
So let’s not mistake these long-held
liberal policy goals as some new, tar-
geted response to Russian meddling.
Election security is too important to
become a Trojan horse for ideological
goals that Democrats have wanted for
many years.
We need to continue the serious work
that Federal, State, and local officials
are engaging in every day—work that
is already yielding results—and we
need to stay vigilant because our ad-
versaries will not stop.
So I want to salute the Federal,
State, and local professionals who
helped make last week an apparent
election security success. I urge Senate
Democrats to stop blocking a bipar-
tisan appropriations process so that we
can secure hundreds of millions of dol-
lars more for the folks out there on the
frontlines.

EXECUTIVE SESSION
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read the nomination of Steven J.
Menashi, of New York, to be United
States Circuit Judge for the Second
Circuit.
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
REMEMBERING KAY HAGAN
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last
month, we lost Kay Hagan after a long
illness.
Kay was always a fighter, starting
with her days in the North Carolina
State Legislature and continuing to
when she answered the call of serving
the Senate during the perilous days of
the great recession. Kay was the right
person to fight for North Carolina
when she was needed the most.
She came from a family who knows
service and sacrifice. Her uncle was
Lawton Chiles, a Korean war veteran
and former Representative, Senator,
and Governor of Florida. Her father
and brother served in the Navy. Her fa-
ther-in-law was a major general in the
Marine Corps. Her husband is a Viet-
nam veteran who used his GI bill to
pay for law school. When Kay talked
about veterans’ issues, she spoke from
the heart.
Kay was born into politics. As a
young girl, she was putting bumper
stickers on cars for her uncle. Her fa-
ther won an election to become mayor
of Lakeland, FL. While interning for
her uncle, Kay learned about the ups
and downs of Congress, literally. She
operated the Senators-only elevator in
this building.
North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt
first encouraged Kay to run for office
when she served as his Guilford County
campaign chairman. In 1998, she un-
seated a Republican incumbent and
won a seat in the North Carolina State
Senate. For 10 years, Kay Hagan
earned a reputation as a commonsense
hard worker, interested in results, not
partisan fighting. As cochair of the
State budget committee, she increased
the State’s rainy day fund and bal-
anced five straight budgets. She helped
make record investments in education,
raised the pay for teachers, and in-
creased the minimum wage.
She was one of the most versatile
women in her State. She juggled Girl
Scout events, winning reelection four
times, raising her growing family, and
serving as a Sunday school teacher and
a Presbyterian Church elder.
In 2008, Kay ran for and won a U.S.
Senate seat, becoming the Senate’s
first female Democratic Senator. With
her family’s military background, it
surprised no one that Kay fought hard
in the Senate for military families and
veterans. When she heard about 9-year-
old Janey Ensminger—daughter of a re-
tired marine—passing away from leu-
kemia because of contaminated water
on the base of Camp Lejeune, she
worked to pass the Janey Ensminger
Act to help those affected receive
healthcare.
Kay also introduced a bill that was
close to my heart. It would ban for-
profit colleges from using the phrase
‘‘GI bill’’ in their aggressive marketing
efforts aimed at separating veterans
and servicemembers from their hard-
earned education benefits.
Kay was fearless with her voting. She
made the toughest votes count, know-
ing the consequences to her own ca-
reer. As long as it helped people of
North Carolina and the United States,
she was always a crucial partner. The
Affordable Care Act and the 2009 eco-
nomic stimulus package were politi-
cally difficult for many, but Kay
stepped up and supported them. She
was brave to the highest degree. Histo-
rians will remember that bravery. She
stepped up when America needed her.
Today, because of it, America is
stronger and better.
We will all remember Kay Hagan for
her friendship and that we had the
privilege to call her a friend and col-
league.
She is survived by her husband Chip,
her three children—Jeanette Hagan,
Tilden Hagan, Carrie Hagan Stewart—
her father Joe P. Ruthven, two broth-
ers, and five grandchildren.
It was my honor to serve with Kay
Hagan and to memorialize her service
to North Carolina and the United
States in this statement today.
I yield the floor.

jority whip.
NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, No-
vember is National Adoption Month.
Later this morning, I will be spending
time with a family I nominated to re-
ceive an Angels in Adoption Award this
year. The Angels in Adoption Program
is designed to bring recognition to indi-
viduals and organizations who are, in
the words of the program, ‘‘making ex-
traordinary contributions to adoption,
permanency, and child welfare.’’
Angels in Adoption is a program in
the Congressional Coalition on Adop-
tion Institute, and each year Members
of Congress are invited to nominate an
individual or family to receive an An-
gels in Adoption Award. I have been
making these nominations for more
than a decade now. It has been a privi-
lege and an inspiration to meet South
Dakota families who have opened their
hearts and homes to children in need.
This year, I nominated Mike and Kim
Adams, fellow residents of Sioux Falls,
SD. Mike and Kim have a tremendous
heart for children. They have five bio-
logical children, but as they learned
more about the plight of children in
poverty, they were drawn to adoption.
God put the country of Ethiopia on
their hearts in a particular way. In
2008, they adopted a daughter from
Ethiopia—Eva. Within a few years,
they had adopted three more children—
Selena and Amanuel from Ethiopia and
Shakira from Uganda—making them a
family of 11. The story doesn’t end
there. Seeing the poorest of the poor in
Ethiopia deeply moved them, and in
addition to adoption, they sought ways
to help communities stuck in poverty.
The needs of children were particu-
larly close to their hearts. In 2013,
Mike and Kim agreed to take over two
schools in Ethiopia when the agency
running them was forced to pull out of
the country. The Adams family formed
the Adams Thermal Foundation to sup-
port the schools. Today the foundation
supports more than 1,000 students in
two schools in Ethiopia. The schools’
mission is to serve children most in
need—those who might otherwise miss
out on the opportunity for an edu-
cation. In addition to academic in-
structions, schools provide other re-
sources in an effort to alleviate some of
the effects of poverty and to make it
easier for the children to stay in
school.
To name one example, at the end of
last year, the foundation completed a
project to provide a permanent source
of clean water to its school in Ottoro,
Ethiopia, as well as to seven local vil-
lages. In addition to providing essen-
tial health and sanitation benefits, the
new pipeline also frees children from
the hours-long task of fetching water
for their families, meaning more chil-
dren can attend school.
In learning Mike and Kim’s story, I
was struck by how love multiplies and
expands. Mike and Kim’s willingness to
open their hearts has led not only to
four children finding a forever home
but to hope and opportunity for hun-
dreds more. I feel privileged to have
learned their story and to be able to
nominate them for an Angels in Adop-
tion Award this year.
National Adoption Month is a chance
to honor all those who, like the Adams,
chose to welcome a child in need of a
home. Sadly, not every child is born
into a safe and loving home. Some are
born to parents who are unable to take
care of them. Some lose their parents
to war, accident, or illness, and, trag-
ically, some are born to parents who
refuse to take care of them or actively
seek to damage the great gift in their
care.
Thankfully, there are parents out
there eager to receive these children.
Across our country, there are countless
parents whose homes and hearts are al-
ready prepared to welcome a child in
need. They may not yet know the
names of their future sons or daugh-
ters, but they are ready and waiting to
meet them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6582 November 14, 2019
National Adoption Month is a good
time to rededicate ourselves to caring
for children in need and helping them
find loving families to receive them.
In the gospel of Mark, Jesus says,
‘‘Whoever welcomes one of these little
children in my name welcomes me.’’
There are few actions more worthy of
admiration than a decision to welcome
a child in need and to create for that
child a secure and loving home.
I am so grateful for all of the gen-
erous families across this country who
have opened their hearts and found
sons and daughters through adoption. I
am also thankful for all of the birth
mothers who have chosen adoption for
their children to give them better lives
in loving families.
I am honored to recognize the Adams
family today for their embrace of their
own adopted children, as well as every-
thing they have done to make life bet-
ter for children in Ethiopia.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The Democratic leader is recognized.
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
for the past few weeks, including this
morning, the Republican leader has
amazingly accused the Democrats of
being uninterested in making progress
for the American people because we are
so distracted by the impeachment in-
quiry into President Trump. It is a lu-
dicrous charge, not the least because
Leader MCCONNELL has shuttered the
Senate when it comes to legislative
business.
The House has passed over 250 bills
that Leader MCCONNELL has taken no
action on here in the Senate. Leader
MCCONNELL proudly called himself the
Grim Reaper and blocked just about
everything that came through the
House long before impeachment was
even being talked about. So this idea
that impeachment is blocking us from
doing things belies Senator MCCON-
NELL’s record. Let me repeat it. The
House has passed 250 bills, and Senator
MCCONNELL has taken no action on
them from January forward.
There are lots of these bills we could
have put on the floor this week, but
there has been not a one. The Repub-
licans just block and block. They block
legislation to protect Americans with
preexisting conditions, to reauthorize
the Violence Against Women Act, and
even to secure our elections from for-
eign interference.
A few minutes ago, I heard Leader
MCCONNELL say that everything was
fine with the elections and that we
don’t need any more legislation. Go
talk to the election officials around
the States. The States are the ones
that have the say. The bottom line is
they think we need to do more, and the
experts think we need to do more. Only
Leader MCCONNELL doesn’t. Again, he
is blocking that. If Russia interferes in
2020—and I hope it will not—all eyes
will be on the Republican leader, who
has repeatedly prevented us from mov-
ing forward on bipartisan legislation to
make our elections safer.
To show another example of the leg-
islative graveyard, in a few minutes,
the two Senators from Connecticut—
MURPHY and BLUMENTHAL—will be
moving forward on bipartisan back-
ground checks, H.R. 8. It is overwhelm-
ingly supported by the American peo-
ple. Senator MURPHY and Senator
BLUMENTHAL will ask for unanimous
consent, and the Republicans will ob-
ject. So, while the Republican leader
accuses the Democrats of being too dis-
tracted to make progress, he has
turned the Senate into a legislative
graveyard, where we hardly ever vote
on legislation, where we hardly ever
have an open amendment process,
where we hardly ever debate major
issues. This is despite commitments
that have been made by the Republican
leader in the past. At one point, he
said—and I am sure my colleagues from
Connecticut will point this out—yes,
we ought to do something on back-
ground checks. Yet nothing has hap-
pened—nothing.
You don’t even have to ask me. My
friend the Republican Senator from
Pennsylvania, Mr. TOOMEY, said some-
thing last week that caught my atten-
tion. He and I may not agree on much,
but here is what he said: ‘‘Our Demo-
cratic colleagues have frequently criti-
cized the Republican leadership and
Republican majority for not legis-
lating. Sometimes they have a point.’’
Those are his words, not mine.
I was here on the floor yesterday
with the senior Senator from Texas,
and we talked about how the Senate
might go about trying to lower the
costs of prescription drugs. I disagreed
with the Senator’s unanimous consent
request, as it was too narrow a rifle
shot. We need to do a whole lot more.
Yet we agreed we could work through
the issues if the Republican leader
would only allow a debate on the floor
whereby both sides could offer amend-
ments and receive votes. We Democrats
very much want to vote on legislation
that would maintain protections for
the people who have preexisting condi-
tions. We Democrats very much want
to have a vote on allowing Medicare to
negotiate with the drug companies to
dramatically lower drug prices. Let’s
have a debate on all of these. Who is
stopping that? It is not the Democrats.
It is the Republican leader.
The fact of the matter is, the kinds
of open debates for which we wish and
the American people wish have not
happened in Leader MCCONNELL’s legis-
lative graveyard. The man who proudly
called himself the Grim Reaper goes
far too far in accusing the Democrats
of stifling progress. Instead, he should
take a hard look in the mirror.
IMPEACHMENT
Madam President, in the House im-
peachment inquiry into President
Trump, public hearings began yester-
day with the testimony of George Kent
and William Taylor.
Ambassador Taylor, who is a career
public servant and a war hero who has
long served Presidents of both parties,
provided a startling new revelation—
that his aide overheard a conversation
between President Trump and Ambas-
sador Sondland, during which the
President made clear he cared more
about Ukraine’s investigating the
Bidens than he did about helping
Ukraine. The aide is reportedly set to
appear before the House for a deposi-
tion later this week, and Mr. Sondland
is set to appear before the Intelligence
Committee for a public hearing next
week.
All Senators will have an obligation
to seek and review the full facts that
will be developed by this inquiry to be
able to render impartial justice. How-
ever, some of my Republican friends in
the Senate have said they are not even
paying attention to the hearings in the
House. The distinguished chairman of
the Committee on the Judiciary—a
former House manager of an impeach-
ment case, who, at the time, repeatedly
urged Senators not to make up their
minds before the case was in—recently
said that he has made up his mind, that
there is nothing there. This is before a
single bit of evidence has been pre-
sented in the Senate. Alice in Wonder-
land: First is the verdict, then the
trial. That is not becoming for the
chairman of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary.
While my Republican colleagues may
not have been paying attention, I have
been paying attention, and my Demo-
cratic colleagues in the Senate, who
know they might have to act as judges
and jurors in this case, are paying at-
tention. America is also paying atten-
tion. The evidence we all heard from
Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent has cast a
troubling portrait of a President who is
trying to use the powers of his office
for personal political gain. As the pub-
lic hearings continue, we have a re-
sponsibility here in the Senate not to
prejudge the case but to examine the
evidence impartially. At the very least,
Senators should be paying attention.
NOMINATION OF STEVEN J. MENASHI
Madam President, the Senate will
vote today on the confirmation of Ste-
ven J. Menashi to serve on the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals.
In all my time in this body, Mr.
Menashi has been one of the most con-
temptible nominees to have come be-
fore the Senate. He would be a disgrace
to the seat once held by the great
Thurgood Marshall.
While sitting before the Committee
on the Judiciary, Menashi refused to
answer simple questions. He showed a
breathtaking contempt for Senators on
both sides of the aisle. His record on

race, women’s equality, LGBTQ rights,
and the rights of immigrants should be
disqualifying. At the Department of
Education, he helped to cook up an il-
legal scheme to use the Social Security
data of students who had been swindled
by for-profit colleges in order to deny
them debt relief. A judge ruled this
scheme violated Federal privacy laws.
At the very least, a candidate for a
judgeship should show respect for the
law. That is the lowest possible bar. A
judge is supposed to revere the law, up-
hold it, and apply it with an even hand.
How can anyone trust Mr. Menashi to
come even close to doing that? Mr.
Menashi is a textbook example of
someone who does not deserve to sit on
the Federal bench, particularly with a
lifetime appointment.
My Republican colleagues, in my
view, have rubberstamped too many of
these extreme, unqualified nominees—
nominees, in Mr. Menashi’s case, who
have been almost craven, but on few
occasions, a small group has stood up
and said: Enough. This is too far.
Well, my colleagues, if there were
ever anyone who was too far, it is
Menashi. There is no reason President
Trump couldn’t find a more suitable
nominee for the Second Circuit Court
of Appeals. I urge my Republican col-
leagues to do the right thing today and
reject the Menashi nomination.
TAX RETURNS
On tax returns, yesterday a Federal
appeals court ruled that Congress can
seek 8 years of the President’s tax re-
turns. No doubt, the President will ap-
peal the ruling to the Supreme Court
in an effort to keep hidden what the
President has been hiding for as long as
he has been in public life—his tax re-
turns.
Why the President has engaged in
such an astounding breach of trans-
parency is still unknown.
President Trump, what are you hid-
ing?
The DC Circuit’s decision—an 8-to-3
ruling—was clearly the correct legal
result. It should be upheld.
FARMERS AND VETERANS
Last but not least, on farmers and
veterans, President Trump has long
fashioned himself a champion of every-
day Americans—workers, farmers, vet-
erans. This week has been a grim re-
minder that despite the President’s
promises, almost every week his ad-
ministration undermines the very peo-
ple he claims to champion.
Take our veterans whose service we
commemorated earlier this week on
Veterans Day. The Department of Vet-
erans Affairs decided in 2017 to help
Vietnam-era veterans who were ex-
posed to Agent Orange by expanding
the list of diseases that were eligible
for health benefits to include bladder
cancer, hypertension, Parkinson’s-like
symptoms, and hypothyroidism.
There are tens of thousands of vet-
erans whose lives would be changed by
this decision. It was the right decision
based on research done by the VA. Un-
fortunately, it was recently revealed
that OMB Director and Acting White
House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney
blocked funding for these new health
benefits because of what it would cost.
Think about that. Mick Mulvaney, who
thought adding $1.5 trillion to our def-
icit was an acceptable cost for tax cuts
to the rich, believes the cost of health
benefits for sick veterans is just too
high. So wrong. So wrong. It is shame-
ful that Mulvaney could actually be in
the position he is.
The next time the President claims
to be a champion for our Nation’s vet-
erans, the American people should re-
member what he is doing here—deny-
ing benefits to men and women who
were in our Armed Forces, exposed to
Agent Orange, and are now sick. It is
too expensive to help them but not too
expensive to give tax cuts to the
wealthiest of Americans. Shame on the
administration, shame on Mulvaney,
and shame on President Trump.
What about our farmers? It is no se-
cret that America’s farmers have
struggled as a result of President
Trump’s trade policies and retaliatory
tariffs from other countries. The ad-
ministration even created a new pro-
gram through USDA to help offset the
losses farmers were facing.
Well, now it turns out that the
Trump administration has grossly mis-
handled that program. A report by the
Democratic minority on the Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry Com-
mittee, led by its ranking member,
Senator STABENOW, revealed that the
lion’s share of Federal aid has gone to
large agricultural conglomerates scat-
tered across the South, not to small
family farms in the Midwest who have
suffered the most. Ninety-five percent
of the largest per-acre payments have
gone to Southern States, while the
lowest payments have disproportion-
ately gone to the farmers who are suf-
fering in the Midwest. The administra-
tion lifted the limits on aid to row
crops but kept the limits for other
crops, meaning that more aid has gone
into the pockets of the largest and
wealthiest farms in America. The re-
port even showed that tens of millions
of dollars have gone to foreign-owned
entities, including a beef factory in
Brazil.
President Trump has claimed to look
after our farmers, and he has claimed
to look after our veterans, but he has
instead turned his back on them. More
and more Americans—farmers, vet-
erans, others—are starting to notice.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from
Washington.
H.R. 8
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want
to thank Senators MURPHY and
BLUMENTHAL for their tremendous lead-
ership that we are here on the floor
today to speak about.
I come today not just as a Member of
the Senate representing my home
State of Washington but as a former
educator, as a mother, and as a grand-
mother devastated by how the gun vio-
lence epidemic is tearing apart our
families and ravaging our communities
in every State.
I am furious at Republican leaders
who continue to stand by and do noth-
ing while more and more lives are lost,
just as I was after Newtown, Parkland,
Sutherland Springs, and Marysville in
my home State of Washington. I could
go on.
We don’t have to continue this cycle
of violence, heartbreak, and inaction,
and we are here today to emphasize
that there is action we can take right
now because earlier this year, the
House passed H.R. 8—meaningful, bi-
partisan gun safety legislation—to ad-
dress this terrible crisis through uni-
versal background checks and other
popular reforms. But in the 260 days
since H.R. 8 passed the House, it has
languished here in the Senate despite
repeated calls from myself and my
Democratic colleagues for a vote.
That is why 58 days ago, following
the tragic events at El Paso, Dayton,
and Midland, I joined my Senate Demo-
cratic colleagues here on the floor to
try to break the cycle and demand that
we address the scourge of gun violence
in this country by taking a vote here
in the Senate on H.R. 8, which would
install universal background checks—a
policy that, by the way, is supported by
an overwhelming majority of Ameri-
cans.
In the face of Republican apathy,
people across the country raised their
voices even louder, demanding action
to end the endless wave of gun tragedy,
so much so that after this summer’s
string of horrors, President Trump
bowed to public pressure and made a
commitment to finally act to address
the gun violence epidemic.
After months and years of inaction
and far, far too many lives lost, it was
the first sliver of hope in a long while—
that the President and Senate Repub-
licans would finally put the safety of
our families over their allegiance to
the NRA and do something substantive
about ending this Nation’s gun vio-
lence epidemic, working with Demo-
crats toward commonsense reforms to
end gun violence and keep people safe.
Now, more than 2 months later,
President Trump has betrayed his
pledge to address this tragic epidemic
as if the past summer never even hap-
pened. Once again, he has chosen to ab-
dicate his responsibility to keep our
families and our communities safe and
has broken yet another promise he
made to the American people, kow-
towing to the NRA and its unpopular,
hard-right agenda to stymie common-
sense gun reform as soon as mass
shootings were out of the headlines.
Well, I can assure you, Senate Demo-
crats and I are going to keep fighting
for commonsense gun safety reforms,
like universal background checks, even
when gun violence isn’t making a head-
line that day, because while President
Trump continues carrying water for
the NRA and Senate Republicans con-
tinue hiding behind President Trump,

S6584 November 14, 2019
Democrats here understand that Con-
gress has a duty to act to protect lives,
and that the President’s cowardice ab-
solutely should not set Congress’s
agenda.
While President Trump’s back-
tracking on this serious issue is dis-
graceful, I ask my Republican col-
leagues to remember that we are not
beholden to the President or to the gun
lobby and that we do not need Presi-
dent Trump’s permission to vote on
bills or to act to save lives.
In fact, in States across the country,
we have been able to take on the gun
lobby and make meaningful progress to
address this crisis.
In my home State of Washington, we
have closed background check loop-
holes, and we have enacted extreme
risk protection orders. We were able to
accomplish those things because of the
advocacy of groups like Moms Demand
Action across my State, the Wash-
ington State Alliance for Gun Respon-
sibility, Everytown for Gun Safety,
March for Our Lives, and so many
more, as well as the dedicated volun-
teers and activists behind those organi-
zations, the brave people who have
been out making their voices heard and
putting pressure on lawmakers to do
their jobs to end this senseless epi-
demic, people like Jane Weiss, who
lives in Mill Creek, WA. After she trag-
ically lost her niece to gun violence,
Jane joined the fight to pass lifesaving
legislation in Washington State by put-
ting pressure on her State lawmakers
and won.
There are people like Jane all across
the country who are speaking up and
fighting back, even when it means re-
living some of the hardest moments of
their lives, in order to prevent others
from suffering as much as they have.
That is hard and brave work to do, but
there is absolutely nothing hard or
brave about simply having a vote on bi-
partisan, House-passed legislation to
ensure universal background checks.
To the contrary, it is the height of
cowardice not to hold that vote while
families across the country wonder
which movie theater or shopping mall
or synagogue or mosque or church or
community space is next and while stu-
dents spend their time in school on ac-
tive shooter drills while they should be
learning. Unfortunately, cowardice is
what we are seeing from far too many
Republicans here in the Senate and in
the White House when it comes to pro-
tecting families from this scourge of
gun violence.
I want to be clear. I hope my Repub-
lican colleagues allow this legislation
to pass today, but if they don’t, for
Jane and so many others, Senate
Democrats are going to keep shining a
spotlight on the inaction on gun vio-
lence here in the Senate and the bro-
ken promises coming out of the White
House. We are going to keep making
the case, building support, and we will
not give up until this is done.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 8
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, as Sen-
ator MURRAY noted, 100 people die from
gunshot wounds every single day. We
can’t go 24 hours without news of an-
other mass shooting somewhere in
America. My kids and millions of oth-
ers hide in corners of their classrooms
or in their bathrooms preparing for a
mass shooting at their school, and this
body does nothing about it.
The good news is, we have a piece of
legislation that enjoys 95 percent sup-
port in the American public and will
undoubtedly make an enormous impact
on gun violence rates in this country.
I will give more extensive remarks
after I make this unanimous consent
request, but my request will be that
the Senate immediately take up H.R. 8,
the universal background checks bill
which was passed in a bipartisan way
in the House of Representatives and
which has received no action, no debate
here in the U.S. Senate since that
time.
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed
to the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 29, H.R. 8; further, that the
bill be considered read a third time and
passed and the motion to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the
table with no intervening action or de-
bate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
an objection?
The Senator from Mississippi.
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President,
reserving the right to object, legisla-
tion that would affect the rights of
American citizens under the Second
Amendment should not be fast-tracked
by the Senate. Efforts to criminalize
otherwise lawful conduct with firearms
by law-abiding gun owners should not
be exempt from consideration by the
appropriate committee of jurisdiction.
It should not be exempt from debate on
the Senate floor.
If this so-called commonsense, bipar-
tisan legislation was indeed crafted
with strong bipartisan input, it
shouldn’t have any problems advancing
by regular order.
Many questions about this legisla-
tion need to be answered before it is
forced upon law-abiding gun owners. If
I wanted to give my best friend’s son or
grandson my hunting rifle, would we
first have to appear before a licensed
gun dealer and go through a lengthy
and potentially expensive background
check? This is my understanding. We
have many questions like this.
My constituents would like to have
an opportunity to weigh in on meas-
ures like these, which is why we can’t
fast-track legislation that affects
America’s Second Amendment rights.
I object to this unanimous consent.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Connecticut.
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the good-faith objection from my
friend from Mississippi, but the good
news that I can convey to her is that
my Republican Senate friends who
want to have some impact into the
consideration of the future of Amer-
ican gun laws have ample opportunity
to do that because they are in the ma-
jority.
Senate Republicans control the Judi-
ciary Committee. Senator MCCONNELL
can decide to bring any measure to the
floor. If the concern is that there
hasn’t been enough Republican input
into the question of whether criminals
or terrorists or people who are seri-
ously mentally ill get guns, then, con-
vene a discussion on this, bring a de-
bate to the floor, have a process in the
Judiciary Committee. Don’t just stay
silent. It doesn’t pass the straight-face
test to come down here and say: Well,
we can’t take up H.R. 8, despite the
fact it has 90 percent public approval
because we haven’t had input on it.
You are in the majority. You have the
ability to pass legislation that you sup-
port and that Democrats can support
as well.
The idea that we are just going to sit
here and twiddle our thumbs week
after week as 100 people are killed by
guns through suicides and homicides
and accidental shootings is an abdica-
tion of our basic responsibility as U.S.
Senators. There is nothing that mat-
ters more to our constituents than
their physical safety.
There are kids who are walking to
school in cities in every single State in
this Nation who fear for their lives,
whose brain chemistry is changed by
the trauma they go through because of
that fear for their safety, and they
can’t learn, they can’t cope, and they
can’t build strong relationships.
My kids go through active shooter
drills at school because they, in fact,
expect that someday someone will
walk through their doors and start fir-
ing a military-style assault weapon in
one of their classrooms.
I get it that there is a difference of
opinion on exactly how we should ex-
pand background checks. I understand
that maybe my Republican colleagues
don’t want to support H.R. 8. But you
are in the majority. You have the abil-
ity to lead a conversation that can find
that common ground on expanding
background checks.
I am not going to accept this argu-
ment that we can’t bring H.R. 8 to the
floor because we have some concerns
about it. I can’t get a piece of legisla-
tion to the floor any other way than to
offer this motion.
The American public is not going to
accept silence from this body week
after week, month after month, in the
face of this epidemic carnage that is
happening across this country. Parents
know their kids aren’t safe, and they
expect us to act.
The President’s Attorney General
said the other day that we made some
progress on the issue of background
checks over the summer, but now we
have the impeachment proceedings,
and so that stops all of this discussion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6585
November 14, 2019
That is not true. The impeachment
proceedings right now are in the House
of Representatives. The discussion on
the future of a background checks bill
was in the Senate. It was happening be-
tween myself and Senator MANCHIN and
Senator TOOMEY. We are still at the
table, ready to negotiate a compromise
version of the Background Check Ex-
pansion Act. We, frankly, have lots of
time on our hands in the Senate be-
cause we are not doing anything other
than approving an appointee here, a
judge there. We have plenty of time.
We have plenty of bandwidth in the
Senate to negotiate with the White
House over a universal background
checks bill.
You can’t say that we can’t take up
H.R. 8 because we haven’t had input.
Republicans are in charge. You have
the ability to have as much input as
you want. The White House can’t say
the impeachment is stopping a debate
on background checks from happening.
I am ready to talk. Senator TOOMEY is
ready to talk. Senator MANCHIN is
ready to talk.
We have evidence from this summer
about how important universal back-
ground checks are. On the last day of
August, a gunman fled from police in
Odessa, TX. He hijacked a U.S. Postal
Service van. He killed its driver and
then randomly fired on people as he
drove through the streets. During his
shooting spree, the gunman killed
seven people and wounded over 20 oth-
ers—a reign of terror throughout the
streets of this Texas town.
The current background checks law
worked as it was intended to work. The
shooter tried to buy a gun in January
2014, but he was denied. Why? Because
he had been found to be so seriously
mentally ill when he was committed to
an inpatient institution that his name
was placed on the list of individuals
who were prohibited from buying weap-
ons.
The problem is, Texas doesn’t have
universal background checks, meaning
that it was as easy as pie for the shoot-
er, after he got denied a gun purchase
at a brick-and-mortar store, to just go
find a private seller who would sell him
a military-style weapon without a
background check. In this case, it re-
sulted in 20 people getting hurt and
seven people being wounded—this easy
way to find loopholes through the Na-
tion’s background check system. But
that happens every single day. Every
single day, somebody buys a gun at a
gun show or online or through a pri-
vate sale because that is the way they
can get a gun without having to go
through a background check.
I am deeply troubled. I am pro-
foundly aggrieved by my body’s reluc-
tance to even take up a conversation
about the future of gun policy in this
country. I wish there wasn’t an objec-
tion. I wish we had an opportunity to
be able to discuss the future of back-
ground checks and the future of our
gun laws on the Senate floor. Our con-
stituents expect us to have that de-
bate.
This will not be the last time we
come down to the floor to try to force
a debate, to force a conversation in
this body so that we can find bipar-
tisan consensus on an issue that enjoys
95 percent public support, 80 percent
support from gun owners, and 70 per-
cent support from NRA members.
There is almost nothing else that is
less controversial in America today
than the issue of universal background
checks, and we will continue to press
that case on behalf of the American
people.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut.
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President,
we ought to be aggrieved, we ought to
be angry, and we ought to be furious—
not just frustrated but furious—at this
sad, even pathetic, objection to moving
forward with a bill that is supported by
95 percent of the American people. The
simple fact is that our Senate col-
leagues have been talking to us in good
faith, not only about a background
checks bill but also about emergency
risk protection orders, because we
know there is no single solution, no
panacea, and that emergency risk pro-
tection orders are the other side of the
coin to background checks.
Last week, the Washington Post re-
ported that President Trump has given
up on passing lifesaving gun violence
legislation. The reason is fierce lobby
by the NRA.
Let’s face the stark truth here. The
objection on the floor today is not the
result of any lack of clarity about the
need for background check legislation.
It is the result, purely and simply, of
the President saying no.
We need to do our job. We have con-
tinued talks, in fact, with members of
the White House staff after the im-
peachment proceedings began. My hope
is that the Washington Post article is
untrue. I believe it, certainly, in no
way forestalls or prevents these discus-
sions from continuing. I think there is
a reason to hope, but it will take cour-
age and strength to do it.
The President said yesterday that he
was too busy doing his job meeting
with the President of Turkey—an indi-
vidual who has potentially enabled war
crimes in northern Syria. If he wasn’t
too busy to do that kind of meeting, he
shouldn’t be too busy to do gun vio-
lence prevention.
The fact is that the stakes are simply
too high for there to be delay, and
36,000 Americans are killed every year,
or more. That is 100 every day. Gun
deaths are, in fact, rising, not declin-
ing.
The trends are absolutely alarming
and appalling, and we are complicit in
these deaths if we fail to act. As I
speak on the floor right now, there is a
school shooting in Santa Clarita, CA.
How can we turn the other way? How
can we refuse to see that shooting in
realtime, demanding our attention, re-
quiring our action? We are complicit if
we fail to act. It is not just a political
responsibility. It is a moral impera-
tive. The unconscionable loss of life is
our responsibility.
This problem is one that we can
solve. We may not be able to prevent
all the deaths that occur—all 100 every
day in America—but we can save lives.
Our goal has to be to save as many
lives as quickly as possible.
I have been hopeful for the first time
in a long time, as I have talked with
my colleague Senator GRAHAM. He and
I have worked together conscientiously
and closely on ‘‘extreme risk protec-
tion order’’ legislation. There have
been a series of encouraging conversa-
tions with the White House, and all
seemed to be proceeding well, until
there was a report of the President
talking to Wayne LaPierre of the NRA.
Apparently, it takes only a phone
call—or a couple of them—with the
NRA to turn around the White House
and stop the progress we have been
making and throw out the window all
the good work we have done.
Over these past several months, Sen-
ator GRAHAM, the White House, and my
office have made important strides on
emergency risk protection. We know
that they work. They enjoy broad pop-
ular support. At least 70 percent of the
American people support some type of
‘‘extreme risk protection’’ legislation,
including two-thirds of Republicans
and 60 percent of gun owners.
States like Connecticut, which was
the first to adopt them, have shown
they have a palpable, tangible, measur-
able effect. They are a crucial tool for
law enforcement. The full implementa-
tion of Connecticut’s ‘‘emergency risk
protection order’’ law was associated
with a mere 14-percent decline in fire-
arm suicide rates, and the passages of
Indiana’s law in 2005 is associated with
a 7.5-percent decline in the firearm sui-
cide rate.
We know these laws work. In the 17
jurisdictions that have passed them,
there has been a decline in suicides and
homicides and domestic violence shoot-
ings. We can save lives. We can put to-
gether a measure that combines back-
ground checks, emergency risk protec-
tion orders, and other sensible steps.
We can work through this body. The
objection that we are bringing it to the
floor precipitously is absolutely ridicu-
lous. There is no reason we have to
give up now and throw away all our
work simply because the House is
doing something unrelated, on im-
peachment.
There has been too much good work
as well by groups doing the grassroots
task of mobilizing public support—
Moms Demand Action, Students De-
mand Action, and all of the groups that
have rallied around for gun safety. In
Connecticut, the Newtown Action Alli-
ance, Connecticut Against Gun Vio-
lence, and Sandy Hook Promise show
us the way.
In the last election, gun violence was
on the ballot. Gun violence prevention
won. That is the reason the House has
passed H.R. 8. That is the reason why

we should do it here. History will judge
my Republican colleagues harshly if
they fail that, and the voters will judge
them even more immediately equally
harshly.
The NRA is imploding. Its vice-like
grip should be crumbling in this body.
They may have the ear of the Presi-
dent, but they should not have the ear
of my Republican colleagues.
To the President, I say: The NRA is
telling the American public they own
you and that all they have to do is snap
their fingers, and you fall into line.
Prove them wrong. All you need to do
is take the final steps on this legisla-
tion. Give us a green light. Tell us that
we can move forward and that you will
sign this bill.
To the majority leader I say, whether
or not the President gives us that
green light, we need to do our job.
Please do your job. Let us have this

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask

tion or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there

Without objection, it is so ordered.
The concurrent resolution (H. Con.
Res. 72) was agreed to.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, unfor-
tunately, this Congress has been de-
fined by previously unprecedented po-
litical antics. Things that used to be
far above the political fray are now
getting roiled in controversy.
One example is yesterday, when the
minority leader blocked the bipartisan
bill that I introduced to reduce drug
prices—a bill that received unanimous
support in the Judiciary Committee. I
recognize my friend from Connecticut
Senator BLUMENTHAL, who is the chief
Democratic cosponsor of that bill.
I think the most egregious example
of politicalization of things that used
to be nonpartisan has to be the
politicalization of the Violence Against
Women Act, or VAWA. For 25 years,
this program has supported survivors
of domestic violence and sexual assault
through a range of critical programs
and resources.
As a longtime victims’ rights advo-
cate myself, I am a proud supporter of
the Violence Against Women Act, and I
have consistently fought not only to
continue it but to strengthen it as
well.
I think there is more we can and
should do to support victims, and I
know folks on the other side of the
aisle feel the same way. It is safe to
say, though, that we have had our fair
share of disagreements on how exactly
to accomplish that.
Earlier this year, our Democratic
colleagues allowed VAWA to get
caught in the crosshairs of a funding
debate when they insisted we should
not fund this vital program because it
is overdue for updates. This is a rash
move, to be sure. It lines up with the
‘‘my way or the highway’’ legislative
strategy sometimes deployed by our
friends on the other side, but that
hasn’t stopped my Republican col-
leagues, led by Senator JONI ERNST
from Iowa, from pursuing a com-
promise.
For many months now, Senator
ERNST has been working with DIANNE
FEINSTEIN, the Senator from Cali-
fornia, to find ways to make improve-
ments that both sides can agree on.
That is the way things get done around
here: You try to build consensus, and
maybe you don’t get everything you
want, but if you can get 80 percent of
what you want, you ought to take it
and run.
Last week, unfortunately, Democrats
walked away from the negotiating
table when it came to the Violence
Against Women Act. Rather than con-
tinuing the discussions with people of
opposing views, they took the easy way
out and simply walked away and intro-
duced their own partisan reauthoriza-
tion—one they know has no chance of
passing.
Just like the version that passed the
House earlier this year, this is a mes-
saging document, worth no more than
the paper it is written on. It is not
going to reauthorize VAWA or make
the program better, and it is not going
to support victims because it stands no
chance of becoming law.
I am truly disappointed that our
Democratic colleagues, once again,
have chosen to play politics rather
than deliver real results, this time for
the victims of domestic violence and
sexual assault.
Despite the games being played here,
my Republican colleagues and I are
working to put in the hard work it
takes to actually accomplish some-
thing and legislate.
Senator ERNST said she will soon be
introducing a good-faith proposal that
actually has the chance to become law.
It is not a partisan document. It really
is a return to where we used to be,
where the Violence Against Women Act
enjoyed broad support on both sides of
the aisle and was truly not just bipar-
tisan but nonpartisan. It is a shame
that something as urgent and undeni-
ably important as combating domestic
violence and sexual assault has some-
how fallen prey to Washington, DC,
politics.
I hope our colleagues will reconsider
and return to the negotiating table so
we can reach a compromise and finally
reauthorize the Violence Against
Women Act.
E-CIGARETTES
Mr. President, on another matter, in
recent months, there has been a lot of
coverage in the news and in social
media about the health consequences
of e-cigarette use. The ‘‘e’’ stands for
electronic—electronic cigarette use.
We have seen alarming headlines
about vaping-related illnesses that
have led to severe health consequences
and dozens of deaths. I find it particu-
larly concerning that an increased
number of children in middle school
and in high school are using these
products, even though it is incon-
sistent with the law. It is against the
law.
The National Youth Tobacco Survey
estimates that more than 5 million
middle and high school students cur-
rently use e-cigarettes, up from 3.6 mil-
lion last year. Five million middle and
high school children are using this
product that the law says they should
not be using.
Folks at home are certainly dealing
with the fallout. Last year, 19 percent
of Texas high school students had used
an e-cigarette in the last 30 days, and
news reports lead me to believe the
number has done nothing but go up.
Certainly, there are negative health
consequences associated with it. A teen
in Michigan was recently hospitalized,
as my colleague from Michigan well
knows. He was recently hospitalized
after vaping and then had to have an
incredibly rare double lung transplant
because of the damage done to the
lungs.
This is causing alarm for parents, for
educators, for health professionals, and
just about everybody else who has
heard about it. It certainly caught my
attention.
Yesterday the HELP Committee—the
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee—in the Senate held a
hearing to look into the government’s
lackluster response to these public
health concerns. I am seriously con-
cerned with how, compared to tradi-
tional cigarettes, this industry is able
to evade countless government regula-
tions, especially through online sales.
Consumers are able to purchase tra-
ditional cigarettes online, but there
are clear guardrails in place to prevent
minors from using online purchases to
skirt the age restrictions.
At the time of delivery, if you buy
cigarettes online, you have to sign and
show an ID proving your age. That just

makes sense to me. You have to show
ID when you purchase cigarettes at a
gas station or convenience store, and
buying them online should be no dif-
ferent, but in the case of e-cigarettes,
it is different. Anyone, no matter how
old or how young, could go online and
buy e-cigarettes and have them deliv-
ered to your front door, no questions
asked.
You better believe underage kids are
taking advantage of that loophole. A
recent survey found that about one-
third of underage e-cigarette users
bought them online.
What people need to understand is
that e-cigarettes are essentially a nico-
tine delivery device. Nicotine, of
course, is an addictive drug, so it is not
as if there aren’t negative health con-
sequences. Even if they are not smok-
ing tobacco, if they use e-cigarettes,
there are true risks to the health of
these young people.
Now, while an adult, I believe, ought
to be able to do things that maybe neg-
atively impact their health, I think we
have an obligation to protect children,
particularly those who are making bad
decisions, before they are prepared to
understand what the consequences
really are.
So while it is important for us to un-
derstand the health impact of these de-
vices and have serious conversations
with our own children about the risks,
we should do something to prevent
children from getting their hands on e-
cigarettes in the first place.
I have introduced a bill with Senator
FEINSTEIN and Senator VAN HOLLEN
that prevents the online sale of e-ciga-
rettes to minors using the same safe-
guards that stop them from being able
to use regular cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco products on the internet. The
law is the same with regard to who can
legally purchase them, so we ought to
have the procedures in place that pre-
vent underage smokers from buying
cigarettes online without a signature
and without an identification card
proving their age. We ought to have
the same procedures in place for e-ciga-
rettes.
This bill, thankfully, has broad bi-
partisan support, with one-quarter of
all Senators serving as cosponsors, and
it has recently passed the House by a
voice vote.
When we talk about passing con-
sensus legislation in the Senate, this is
about as easy as it comes. I hope we
can bring this legislation to the Senate
floor soon so we can prevent the next
generation from using legal loopholes
to get their hands on e-cigarettes.
I yield the floor.

VA MISSION ACT
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this
week, America is paying tribute to
more than 19 million people in our
country and a half million people in
Michigan who show us every day what
service is all about.
America’s veterans have served in
many ways and on many different
fronts. However, I think they all have
a couple of things in common.
The first is that they love our Nation
so much that they are willing to put
their lives on the line for our Constitu-
tion, our democracy, our values, and
our ideals for our country. The second
is that they understand that patriot-
ism is a lot more than a feeling of
pride. Instead, it is a way of life.
Veterans don’t finish their military
service, hang up their uniforms, go
home, never to be heard from again. In-
stead, these are the people around us
who take a good look at their commu-
nity, their State, our country, see what
needs to be done, and step up.
Not all of us have what it takes to
serve in our Armed Forces. Yet all of
us do have the ability to follow the ex-
ample of those who have served us, see
a need, and raise our hands. Imagine
how much better off our Nation would
be if we all had that same dedication to
give something back.
As we have been celebrating Veterans
Day this week, we should all remember
that when American men and women
sign up to serve in our armed services,
they really sign a blank check to our
country—a check that could include
everything, including losing their life.
When our Nation accepts that check,
we need to make sure we are holding
up our end of the bargain.
Unfortunately, the Trump adminis-
tration is failing to provide veterans
with the benefits they have earned, es-
pecially when it comes to healthcare.
Congress passed the VA MISSION
Act last year to improve veterans’ ac-
cess to healthcare and to expand bene-
fits to caregivers, which is so impor-
tant. Yet the VA missed the October
deadline—missed the October dead-
line—to include Vietnam and Korean
war veterans in the expansion.
The VA has kicked eligible veterans
out of the caregiver program without
explaining why. Meanwhile, more than
60,000 veterans who received emergency
care at non-VA facilities in 2017 are
still waiting for the VA to pay their
medical bills.
Perhaps worst of all, this administra-
tion turned their backs on more than
80,000 Vietnam-era veterans who devel-
oped illnesses because of toxic exposure
to Agent Orange. We have known for a
long time that Agent Orange exposure
has caused many serious health issues.
In fact, I first started working on
this issue regarding Agent Orange and
fighting for our veterans when I was in
the Michigan State legislature, trying
to get the Federal Government to rec-
ognize and provide VA health coverage
for these illnesses. Over the years,
some things have changed and im-
proved, but it has been way, way too
slow.
Veterans who have been suffering for
years were offered hope in 2017 when
then-Veterans Affairs Secretary David
Shulkin added bladder cancer, under-
active thyroid, high blood pressure,
and Parkinson’s-like symptoms to the
list of diseases eligible for Agent Or-
ange benefits without going through a
lot of bureaucracy in order to get their
healthcare coverage. He did so at the
urging of the National Academy of
Medicine based on the science—medical
science—of the connection.
Unfortunately, veterans with these
conditions are still waiting. This was
back in 2017. They are still waiting to
get that healthcare, and that is be-
cause the Office of Management and
Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney,
quietly ignored the science and re-
jected the coverage expansion. Why?
We now know, through emails that
have been made public, that he thought
it was too costly.
Really? Let me remind you that
these veterans each signed a blank
check to our Nation. For veterans who
were exposed to Agent Orange, the
check they signed is in the amount of
their health and well-being.
A number of colleagues in this Cham-
ber, led by Senator TESTER and Sen-
ator BROWN, whom I see on the floor,
have repeatedly asked the VA to ex-
plain the delay in coverage. Their ques-
tions, over and over again, have gone
unanswered.
We only now know what really hap-
pened when a veteran trying to get
help, trying to get treatment, finally
filed a FOIA request—Freedom of In-
formation Act request—to get informa-
tion about who was holding it up and
what was going on. Just recently, we
have found out that the Office of Man-
agement and Budget—that Mick
Mulvaney blocked the care because he
thought it was going to cost too much.
It is now November of 2019, and Viet-
nam veterans are still not getting
treatment for these diseases. Yester-
day, my friend Senator BROWN from
Ohio requested unanimous consent on
his resolution, which I am pleased to be
a cosponsor of, that expands the dis-
eases covered by the VA for Agent Or-
ange exposure. It would fix this and say
to the OMB Director: We want to make
sure we are keeping our end of the bar-
gain for our Vietnam vets who were ex-
posed to Agent Orange.
Once again, Leader MCCONNELL and
Republicans chose to stand with the
Trump administration and Mick
Mulvaney to stop veterans from get-
ting this critical healthcare coverage. I
was amazed to actually hear the objec-
tion include the words, ‘‘It costs too
much.’’
It is not enough to praise our vet-
erans with words. We do that all the
time, especially around the 11th of No-
vember. Praise doesn’t pay the medical
bills. Praise doesn’t give a veteran a
healthy life, a job, a home, or opportu-
nities.
This administration, Congress, and
our country must keep each and every
promise our country has made to those
who have served, period. Each and
every one of them signed that blank
check to our country.
Leader MCCONNELL, it is time to hold
up our country’s end of the bargain.
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6588 November 14, 2019
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank
Senator STABENOW. She is exactly
right. A couple of times, she used the
term ‘‘blank check.’’ When people join
the Army, people become marines, peo-
ple go off to a service academy, and
people enlist in the National Guard, es-
sentially they sign a blank check
cashed by all of us who care so much
about protecting our country.
Senator STABENOW has been, with
Senator TESTER, one of the real leaders
on this. You know, it used to be, many
years ago, when it became clearer that
veteran after veteran after veteran—
young veterans in those days, 20 years
ago, not that far removed from Viet-
nam—were coming down with these ill-
nesses, Congress decided bipartisanly,
almost unanimously, that rather than
make every single veteran, every sol-
dier, every marine, and every sailor
prove to the government, prove to the
VA that they should be eligible for
healthcare coverage based on the ill-
ness they got because of Agent Or-
ange—Congress decided that we
shouldn’t make every single person go
through proving this—through that
process. So what did we do? We made a
list of illnesses that typically come
from exposure to Agent Orange, and
any veteran who was sick from one of
these illnesses, no questions asked, got
healthcare. That is what we did. That
was then.
Today, in this time when I hear my
colleagues who sit over here—I don’t
want to make this partisan, but it has
become that because it is President
Trump, Vice President PENCE, and Sen-
ator MCCONNELL who say no to this. We
have the Secretary of the VA, ap-
pointed by the President of the United
States, President Trump—the Sec-
retary of the VA came up with these
four additional illnesses around which
there is scientific consensus saying
that these illnesses are caused by
Agent Orange, and individual veterans
shouldn’t have to, one at a time, prove
that they got sick, that they got this
kind of Parkinson’s or they had blad-
der cancer based on Agent Orange. We
ought to just accept that. That is how
we serve those who served us.
But do you know what Senator
MCCONNELL does? You know, his office
is down the hall, as my colleagues
know. Senator MCCONNELL apparently
says that we should do tax cuts for rich
people, but we can’t afford to spend a
few billion dollars. It is a lot of money,
but these are our people, and these are
people who served in Southeast Asia
mostly in the 1960s and 1970s.
Senator MCCONNELL wants to turn
his back on them. President Trump
turns his back on them. The new Sec-
retary of the VA, appointed by Presi-
dent Trump, turns his back on these
soldiers. There are 80,000 of them. Does
President Trump just want to wait till
all 80,000 are dead, and then we will not
have to worry about this anymore? Or
do we serve those who served us?
Every time I think about this, I just
can’t believe that the President of the
United States, who didn’t serve—I
didn’t either. I understand that. But
you know, because I didn’t serve in
Vietnam and I am just slightly on the
young side of this generation, because I
didn’t serve, maybe I should work a lit-
tle harder, as a member of the Vet-
erans’ Committee, to make sure the
people who did serve are taken care of.
This President, who didn’t serve—I
don’t judge him for that. No matter
what he said, I don’t judge him for
that. But maybe he ought to work a
little harder, not just making speeches
about how much he loves veterans but
actually coming to the table and tell-
ing Senator MCCONNELL: Quit blocking
our attempts to take care of these
80,000 veterans. It is just outrageous.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the remainder
of my remarks be placed at a different
point in the RECORD.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
HONORING DETECTIVE JORGE ‘‘GEORGE’’ DEL RIO
Mr. President, I rise to honor a dedi-
cated Ohio public servant, Detective
George Del Rio. For three decades, De-
tective Del Rio served his community
in Dayton with honor and integrity.
On November 4, a few days ago, he
was working as part of a local DEA
drug task force, and he made the ulti-
mate sacrifice to keep his fellow Ohio-
ans safe. He laid down his life while
doing his job. He was working with fel-
low Dayton officers to protect the peo-
ple he was sworn to serve in Miami
Valley.
In the days since his passing, we have
heard story after story after story of
Detective Del Rio’s service to his com-
munity and to his family.
As he was hospitalized, officers from
around Miami Valley packed the hos-
pital hallways and parking lots to show
their support and their respect for De-
tective Del Rio and his wife Kathy and
their children and grandchildren.
Detective Del Rio was beloved by
friends and colleagues. He was devoted
to his family. He was kind. He was
funny. He was fair. He was a good cop
even while spending his days under-
taking dangerous work, often under-
cover.
Detective Del Rio’s career is a re-
minder of the contributions that immi-
grants make to our great country and
to my State. He came to this country
as a child from Mexico. His decades of
teamwork as part of the Dayton Police
Department and the DEA saved lives
and changed lives. He embodied the
Dayton PD’s motto of ‘‘Honor through
service and service with honor.’’
Chief Richard Biehl—whom I have
gotten to know on a number of occa-
sions because of the tragedies of the
shooting and the tornado and the
KKK’s attempted rally in Dayton—said
that Detective Del Rio had an impact
regionally, nationally, and internation-
ally. His legacy will live on through
the many lives he touched, and, not
surprisingly, he continues to serve
through his wishes to be an organ
donor.
In times of tragedy, Ohioans always
rise to the occasion. We have witnessed
an outpouring of community support in
the days since Detective Del Rio was
taken from us. While no gesture, of
course, can ever repay him or Kathy
and his children and grandchildren for
their sacrifice, today we honor this
hero’s memory, and we lift up the en-
tire Dayton community.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for

EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT
Mr. CARDIN. ‘‘Equality of rights
under the law shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or by
any State on account of sex.’’ Most
Americans believe that the Equal
Rights Amendment is part of our Con-
stitution today, but it is not.
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg stated:
Every Constitution written since the end
of World War II includes a provision that
men and women are citizens of equal stature.
Ours does not.
The State of Maryland has a provi-
sion very similar to that in its State
constitution. Many of our States have
acted on the Equal Rights Amendment,
but, as Justice Scalia said, ‘‘Certainly
the Constitution does not require dis-
crimination on the basis of sex. The
only issue is whether it prohibits it. It
doesn’t.’’
We need to pass the Equal Rights
Amendment in the Constitution of the
United States for many reasons. The
most basic reason is that it provides
additional protection against discrimi-
nation against women. It has a higher
standard to prevent discrimination. It
shows America’s leadership globally on
human rights.
In 1972, Congress started the process
by passing the Equal Rights Amend-
ment. We passed it in 1972. Now, of
course, it requires 38 States to ratify it
before it can become law. To date, 37
States have ratified the Equal Rights
Amendment. We are one short of ac-
complishing our objective of putting
the Equal Rights Amendment at long
last in the Constitution of the United
States. But there is an additional po-
tential hurdle; that is, when Congress
passed the resolution in 1972, it put a 7-
year time limit for the States to act.
They extended that to 10 years. This is
strictly a provision that is discre-
tionary to Congress. Article V of the
Constitution puts no limit on the time
for ratification of a constitutional
amendment proposed by Congress for
the States to ratify. In fact, the 27th
Amendment was ratified in 1992. That

deals with congressional pay raises. It
was first proposed in 1789 to be part of
the Bill of Rights, and over 200 years
later, it was ratified. So there is no
time limit in the Constitution for the
ratification of a constitutional amend-
ment.
To remove any doubt, Congress
should extend the time, as it did once
before. In order to accomplish that, I
joined with Senator MURKOWSKI, the
Senator from Alaska, in a bipartisan
effort on S. Res. 6 that removes the
deadline, the time limit on the passage
of the Equal Rights Amendment.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent to have printed in the RECORD
an op-ed piece written by Senator MUR-
KOWSKI and myself in regard to why we
need to get that resolution passed.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the Washington Post, Jan. 25, 2019]
IT’S TIME TO FINALLY PASS THE EQUAL
RIGHTS AMENDMENT
(By Lisa Murkowski and Ben Cardin)
Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, represents
Alaska in the Senate. Ben Cardin, a Demo-
crat, represents Maryland in the Senate.
Men and women should be treated equally
under the law. It seems pretty basic, right?
As we approach the 100th anniversary of
women’s suffrage, it comes as a shock to so
many that the U.S. Constitution does not
guarantee women the same rights and pro-
tections as men.
We come from different ends of the polit-
ical spectrum, but we agree that this needs
to change. Women compose a majority of the
American population but continue to be
underrepresented in government, elected of-
fice, the courts and business world. A level
playing field should not be a euphemism but
rather a reality for women (and men) from
Anchorage to Annapolis and everywhere in
between.
‘‘Equality of rights under the law shall not
be denied or abridged by the United States or
by any State on account of sex.’’
This is the full substance of the Equal
Rights Amendment. It’s a little less than a
tweet, but it will make a positive difference
in the lives of millions of women.
Why is this still necessary? During a 2011
interview, Justice Antonin Scalia summed
up the need for an Equal Rights Amendment.
He said: ‘‘Certainly the Constitution does
not require discrimination on the basis of
sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it.
It doesn’t.’’
On the other side of the spectrum, Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg laid out the rationale
for the ERA in simple terms: ‘‘Every con-
stitution written since the end of World War
II includes a provision that men and women
are citizens of equal stature. Ours does not.’’
Why has it taken this long? Per the Con-
stitution, an amendment must be ratified by
three-fourths of the states to be enacted.
While most amendments are put forward
without a time limit, this one came with a
seven-year deadline. The original was ex-
tended to 10 years, but still, only 35 states
had ratified the ERA by 1982.
While the clock stood frozen at the federal
level, today, nearly half of the states—in-
cluding Maryland and Alaska—have a
version of the ERA written into their con-
stitutions. Gender-based equality represents
the present-day views of the vast majority of
people across the United States, and is the
spirit that underpins our bipartisan legisla-
tion.
The deadline passed in 1982, so isn’t this ef-
fort futile? Not at all.
Nationally, momentum began to shift
about two years ago, as women across the
country began to raise their voices again in
calls for solidarity and equality. The ERA
had never gone away, but the #MeToo move-
ment gave it a jolt of energy and a new spot-
light for inequalities in U.S. law.
In March 2017, 45 years to the day after
Congress overwhelmingly approved the ERA,
Nevada became the 36th state to ratify the
amendment. And then, in May 2018, Illinois
became the 37th.
What had for years been referred to as a
three-state plan—working to have Congress
remove the ratification deadline so that
three more states could ratify the ERA, and
it would become enshrined in our constitu-
tion—had suddenly become a one-state plan.
Earlier this month, Virginia started the
ratification process in their state legisla-
ture. Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina
and Utah could also become state No. 38.
Congress can do its part by explicitly remov-
ing the deadline it once set.
Article V of the Constitution contains no
time limits for ratification of amendments.
The states finally ratified the 27th Amend-
ment in 1992 regarding congressional pay
raises more than 200 years after Congress
proposed it in 1789 as part of the Bill of
Rights.
The original deadline for ERA ratification
was not in the amendment itself but only in
the text of the joint resolution proposing the
amendment. This is to say the amendment
itself has no arbitrary deadline attached.
Whether on purpose or not, Congress hand-
cuffed itself at the time it passed the ERA.
But this Congress can and should easily
amend that language to remove the deadline
for ratification.
We are proud to work together on a bipar-
tisan basis to move this essential legislation
over the finish line and finally make the
ERA part of the Constitution—guaranteeing
equality under the law for women.
Women should not be held back or provided
less opportunity, respect or protections
under the law because of their gender. This
is not a partisan issue but one of universal
human rights. Gender equality should be an
explicit, basic principle of our society.
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, on
November 13, the House Judiciary
Committee took up a very similar reso-
lution, H.J. Res. 79 by Representative
JACKIE SPEIER, and it has now been re-
ported out favorably. So we now have
moving through the House of Rep-
resentatives a resolution that would
remove this time limit that was im-
posed in the 1970s on the ratification of
the Equal Rights Amendment.
What I am imploring upon my col-
leagues is, we are very close to getting
this done. We know there was a change
in leadership in Virginia. Virginia
could very well be the 38th State. But
let’s remove the ambiguity as to a time
limit.
We will celebrate in this Congress the
100th anniversary of the passage of the
19th Amendment to the Constitution,
the women’s suffrage amendment that
passed in 1920. Why did it take so long
for women to have the right to vote?
Well, people are asking: Why is it tak-
ing so long to put the Equal Rights
Amendment into the Constitution of
the United States?
We have a plan to get this done by
passing the resolution I talked about,
the 38th State to ratify it, and that at
long last, the United States will pro-
vide the leadership on universal human
rights by placing the Equal Rights
Amendment in our Constitution.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

HEALTHCARE
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, as
President Trump and the Senate Re-
publicans continue to press forward
with their relentless attacks on fami-
lies’ healthcare, the Democrats are
going to continue to make clear just
what is at stake by lifting up stories of
patients and families across the coun-
try, starting with Natasha from my
home State of Washington.
Because of a diagnosis she received
when she was young, Natasha had long
believed she could not conceive, so she
and her partner were particularly sur-
prised last year to get the news that
she was pregnant. With that unex-
pected news, came all sorts of ques-
tions, including whether they could
handle the cost of things like mater-
nity care, postpartum care, and new-
born care. Fortunately, Natasha’s fam-
ily had coverage through Medicaid, so
all of the medical costs she had been so
concerned about were completely cov-
ered. Instead of worrying about how
they would pay for the healthcare she
needed, she and her partner were able
to focus on getting ready to welcome
the newest addition to their family.
Natasha’s story shows why families
across the country are so worried as
the Republicans continue down the
damaging path they have been on for
years. Since day No. 1 of the Trump ad-
ministration, the Republicans have
been working to raise families’
healthcare costs, take away their cov-
erage, and make healthcare lower qual-
ity.
In the Senate, the Republicans have
stood with President Trump as he has
tried to implement draconian caps on
Medicaid through his Trumpcare bill
and has proposed budgets that slash
funding for Medicaid. They have also
stood by as President Trump has im-
plemented a gag rule on title X-funded
clinics—jeopardizing reproductive
healthcare for millions of patients. The
Republicans are also opposing the
Democrats’ efforts to lower sky-
rocketing prescription drug prices by

allowing Medicare to negotiate on be-

dent Trump’s steps to promote junk in-
surance plans that do not protect pa-
tients with preexisting conditions and
do increase families’ healthcare costs.
The Republicans are even
cheerleading a partisan lawsuit that
will be catastrophic to families across
the country. We could get a ruling on
this lawsuit any day now. If the Repub-
licans get their way, protections for
the over 100 million people in this

lions of families who are covered
through the exchanges and Medicaid

healthcare, and young adults could be
kicked off of their parents’ plans before
they turn 26. Patients could also be
stuck paying tens of thousands of dol-
lars for their care as caps on their out-
of-pocket costs are eliminated, as caps
on their lifetime and annual benefits
come back—even for those, by the way,
who are covered through their employ-
ers’ plans—and as essential benefits
that make sure their coverage includes
things like prescription drugs and
emergency care go away.
For patients like Natasha, the Re-
publicans’ healthcare agenda would be
a disaster. Not only would it gut Med-
icaid, which helped her to get the help
she needed, but if the Republicans suc-
ceed in this lawsuit, insurance compa-
nies could discriminate against pa-
tients like her for having preexisting
conditions, including, by the way,
being pregnant, and insurance compa-
nies could choose not to cover essential
health benefits like maternity care.
The junk plans President Trump is
already promoting leave patients fac-
ing similar problems today. In fact, as
part of their application process, many
of those junk plans ask patients wheth-
er they are pregnant or are planning to
become pregnant. That is because these
junk plans are already allowed to deny
coverage, exclude benefits, or charge
higher premiums for patients with pre-
existing conditions.
The Republicans’ approach to pa-
tients’ healthcare—making it more ex-
pensive, harder to get, and lower qual-
ity—is clearly designed to work for big
insurance companies, not for people
like Natasha. Her story is one of many.
In fact, it is one of tens of millions.
There are so many other families
across the country who are seeing their
well-being being put at risk by the Re-
publicans’ harmful healthcare agenda.
Yet we have seen before what can hap-
pen when people share their stories,
when we lift those stories up, and when
we put faces or names to the people the
Republicans could hurt with their poli-
cies. When the Republicans tried to
jam through their Trumpcare bill, we
stopped it because people across the
country fought back, and they spoke
up.
As President Trump and the Repub-
licans continue using every tool they
can to try and undermine families’
healthcare, the Democrats are going to
be here to continue to remind our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
that everything we do and don’t do in
the Capitol has real consequences for
real families, especially when it comes
to issues like healthcare, which every
family has to deal with.
Whether it is losing coverage right as
you finally have the chance to start a
family or whether it is being rejected
because you have a preexisting condi-
tion, we are going to continue lifting
up those voices who aren’t on the Sen-
ate floor, and we are going to continue
making clear what the GOP’s
healthcare plan would actually mean
to people’s lives. This isn’t a matter of
politics for families; it is a matter of
life and death, and we aren’t going to
let the Republicans forget it.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
NOMINATION OF STEVEN J. MENASHI
Mr. REED. Madam President, I have
serious philosophical disagreements
with many of the judicial nominees put
forth by this administration, but I be-
lieve Mr. Menashi is especially unfit to
serve on the Federal bench. His record
indicates an inability to serve as a fair
and impartial judge. And so I urge my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
reject his nomination to a lifetime ap-
pointment on the bench.
Steven Menashi’s public record dem-
onstrates a deep contempt for a wide
spectrum of Americans, and particu-
larly some of the most vulnerable
amongst us. In his own writings and as
editor in chief of the Dartmouth Re-
view, he has directly expressed or con-
doned disturbing views on issues such
as LGBT rights, racism, and student
aid.
Even if we were to cast these senti-
ments aside, Mr. Menashi’s recent
work in the Trump administration pro-
vides ample evidence that he is unfit
for a lifetime appointment to the
bench. Consider his performance as act-
ing general counsel at the Department
of Education. Mr. Menashi oversaw the
rollback of regulations designed to pro-
tect students and taxpayers from pred-
atory for-profit institutions of higher
education.
More egregiously, Mr. Menashi wrote
the memo outlining the administra-
tion’s scheme to provide only partial
debt relief to students defrauded by
for-profit colleges—a scheme that a
Federal judge ruled violated Federal
privacy laws. Under this scheme, the
Department of Education used data
that was collected to hold institutions
accountable for providing education
leading to gainful employment to fur-
ther punish their victims. The Depart-
ment has still failed to comply with
the court’s orders, resulting in the Sec-
retary of Education being held in con-
tempt.
Mr. Menashi supervised the legal
work on the administration’s proposal
to rewrite the rules dealing with sexual
assault and sexual harassment on col-
lege campuses. The administration’s
own analysis concluded that the new
rules would dramatically reduce the
number of sexual assault investiga-
tions.
Mr. Menashi worked on the rule roll-
ing back efforts to address disparities
in the discipline of students of color
and those with disabilities. In March, a
Federal court ruled that the Depart-
ment had engaged in an illegal delay
and had acted arbitrarily and capri-
ciously.
During Mr. Menashi’s time at the De-
partment of Education, the administra-
tion argued that it was appropriate to
use Federal education funds to pur-
chase guns for schools.
Also consider Mr. Menashi’s time as
a White House counsel where he helped
Stephen Miller in crafting some of the
administration’s most draconian immi-
gration policies. While he was an advi-
sor, the White House cut refugee ad-
missions to a historic low, effectively
banned asylum for refugees traveling
through Mexico, and threatened to end
birthright citizenship.
His views and work experience call
into question how his personal biases
would color his rulings, and whether he
has the judicial temperament and po-
litical independence necessary to serve
on the Federal bench. This is not the
kind of legal judgment that deserves a
lifetime appointment to the Federal ju-
diciary.
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
While the Senate has spent consider-
able time and hours on Mr. Menashi’s
nomination, one can’t help but notice
the fact that the majority leader seems
to scrupulously avoid calling up votes
on legislation that would help working
Americans and working families.
I hear from my Rhode Island con-
stituents every day about countless
pressing issues that the Senate should
be debating and voting on. We could be
considering an infrastructure bill that
would provide robust investment to en-
able the rebuilding of our crumbling
roads, bridges, schools, and other crit-
ical infrastructure. We could be work-
ing to increase Pell grants and lower
the cost of college.
I think every Member of this body
would agree that another vital issue
that we hear often from our constitu-
ents about is the need to address sky-
rocketing prescription drug costs. Ac-
cording to Families USA, nearly 3 in 10
American adults—nearly 80 million
people—have not taken required medi-
cine due to its costs. In fact, addressing
prescription drug costs alone would go
a long way toward bringing down
healthcare costs overall.
There are dozens of proposals from
Senators on both sides of the aisle that
would help to address this issue. Yet
Republican leadership has refused to
allow any debate on prescription drug
prices or on healthcare costs more
broadly this year. Something I, and
many of my colleagues, have proposed
numerous times would be to require
Medicare to negotiate drug prices with

the drug companies to ensure seniors
and taxpayers get the best price. The
Department of Veterans Affairs al-
ready does this. While there is no silver
bullet in solving rising drug costs, this
would be a commonsense first step in
the right direction.
There are also more than 250 bills
passed by the House that Majority
Leader MCCONNELL refuses to bring up
and that have been left in the legisla-
tive graveyard. Let me repeat that.
More than 250 bills are awaiting action
here in the Senate. The House is doing
its part to look out for the people’s
business, and the Senate should follow
suit.
These include the Enhanced Back-
ground Checks Act, which would ex-
pand the national firearms background
check system to include virtually all
gun transfers, and block the illegal
sales that currently happen through
gun shows and private transfers. They
include the reauthorization of the Vio-
lence Against Women Act, which is the
primary law to provide services for vic-
tims of domestic violence, sexual as-
sault, and stalking. They include the
American Dream and Promise Act,
which would provide a pathway to citi-
zenship for DACA recipients, TPS hold-
ers, and those with DED. That’s De-
ferred Enforced Departure.
Furthermore, Republicans continue
to block Democratic-led efforts to pass
commonsense election security legisla-
tion. This is despite warning after
warning from our intelligence and na-
tional security agencies that Russia
undertook an unprecedented effort to
interfere in our 2016 elections and that
the Russians are actively working to
do it again in 2020.
Instead of elevating someone with an
extreme record like Mr. Menashi to one
of the highest courts in the land, we
should be debating and voting on legis-
lation that will protect healthcare, ex-
pand educational opportunity, secure
our elections, fully fund the census,
and prevent gun and domestic vio-
lence—in addition to many, many
other important priorities.
The majority has refused to allow the
Senate to vote on and address the
pressing issues that Americans care
about. And this body is failing to get
its appropriations work done on time.
So I urge the majority leader to end
this partisan paralysis and let the Sen-
ate get to work on issues that can im-
prove the lives of Rhode Islanders and
all Americans.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1573
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President,
as in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee be discharged
from further consideration of S. 1573
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I further ask that
the bill be considered read a third time
and passed and the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Arkansas.
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, while we
very much appreciate what Senator
DUCKWORTH is trying to accomplish, I
must object to the request for unani-
mous consent.
The bill has only one cosponsor and
has not gone through regular order, the
Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee
has not considered the policy implica-
tions of the legislation, and the Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Veterans
Affairs that I chair has not been given
an opportunity to understand the budg-
etary impacts the bill would have.
This legislation would be a signifi-
cant policy change for VA and would
reduce revenue to VA medical centers
by eliminating certain copayments.
Policy changes such as this should be
thoughtfully considered through full
committees before being considered by
the full Senate.
I look forward to working with Sen-
ator DUCKWORTH to see if we can get
this resolved, but based on these facts,
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Illinois.
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President,
I am disappointed that the majority
has objected to passing our bipartisan
legislation.
Every Senator should support a sim-
ple fix to assure veterans enrolled in
the VA system can obtain preventive
medications without out-of-pocket
costs.
All Americans deserve access to the
best healthcare possible, especially the
veterans who signed up to defend our
Nation. Yet, because of this objection,
our veterans will continue to pay more
for essential preventive medications
compared to every other insured Amer-
ican.
One of the Affordable Care Act’s crit-
ical patient protections was prohib-
iting insurance companies and other
health systems, including the Depart-
ment of Defense’s own TRICARE, from
charging copayments for drugs that are
designated as preventive by the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force.
The ACA recognized that preventing
serious illness, such as heart disease
and breast cancer, may help avoid com-
plex and costly medical treatments
down the line.
Most importantly, preventive medi-
cine may also increase patient survival
odds. That is why the ACA required
every insurer to cover preventive medi-
cations at no additional cost to enroll-
ees.
The time has come to expand this
vital patient protection to cover vet-
erans enrolled in VA healthcare. Con-
gress has the power to stop veterans
from being the only ensured Americans
who are charged copays and out-of-
pocket fees for essential drugs and po-
tentially lifesaving preventive health
medication. This includes everything
from critical vaccinations to common
medications such as aspirin to lower
the risk of heart disease and more ad-
vanced drugs such as tamoxifen inhibi-
tors to lower the risk of breast cancer.
The question is simply, Does the Sen-
ate majority in this Congress have the
will to exercise this power to swiftly
fix the problem?
Unfortunately, today’s objection pro-
vided a disappointing answer. I hope
the majority will reconsider its opposi-
tion to passing the bipartisan Veterans
Preventive Health Coverage Fairness
Act by unanimous consent.
I am confident that a Democratic
House majority would act swiftly to
pass S. 1573 if we can get this common-
sense bill to that Chamber. After all, I
am confident that if asked, the major-
ity of Americans—if not all Ameri-
cans—would agree it is simply wrong
to force veterans to pay more for essen-
tial preventive medications that are
critically important to heart disease
and building bone density.
This should not be controversial. It is
certainly viewed as a commonsense
legislative update by the veterans com-
munity.
That is why my bipartisan bill has
been endorsed by the Veterans of For-
eign Wars of the United States, the
American Legion, the Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans, and the Paralyzed Vet-
erans of America.
Making sure veterans enrolled in the
VA system can obtain preventive medi-
cations without paying out of pocket
should be something every Senator can
agree on.
Senate Democrats certainly share
this conviction. That is why every
Member of the Democratic caucus
agreed to pass the bipartisan Veterans
Preventive Health Coverage Fairness
Act right now.
Unfortunately, today’s objection
proves that not every Member of the
Republican conference shares this con-
viction.
With deep disappointment, I yield the
floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6592 November 14, 2019
Colorado and across the country means
a lot of different things to so many
people across our Nation, but one thing
it has always stood for is a day of
thanks to share and celebrate the men
and women in our families and our
communities who have done so much
for our country so that it continues to
be the greatest Nation on the face of
this Earth.
In Colorado, we celebrated with pa-
rades, parties, charity fundraisers,
races and marathons, and events all
over the Centennial State to recognize
the work of our veterans and the sac-
rifice of our veterans and their fami-
lies. Admission to all of our State
parks was free so veterans and their
families could enjoy the land they have
defended.
In Colorado Springs, where we have a
number of veterans and Active-Duty
military members, three of the largest
school districts didn’t take the day off
for Veterans Day but, instead, they
held veteran appreciation events,
breakfasts and lunches with local vet-
erans, invited special speakers, wrote
letters to men and women who have
served, and had other opportunities for
students to learn about the sacrifices
our veterans have made for our coun-
try.
We in Colorado—we in this country
take great pride in our veterans and
our veteran community. In Colorado,
our six military bases, including the
U.S. Air Force Academy, all play a
critical role in defending our Nation
and keeping the world a safer place.
Colorado is home to more than 400,000
veterans who have bravely served our
country.
Earlier this year, I was fortunate
enough to meet more than 100 Colorado
heroes as part of the High Plains Honor
Flight, a tradition that has been car-
ried on for a number of years. It is an
incredible tradition every year—bring-
ing Colorado veterans to our Nation’s
Capital, touring the war memorials,
and taking the opportunity to meet
these veterans, look them in the eye,
shake their hands, and say thank you.
I could spend all week talking on the
floor about Colorado’s veterans and
their incredible acts of service, but if
you get the chance, I hope you will
visit Pueblo, CO. The Home of Heroes
Medal of Honor Memorial is in Pueblo,
CO. The memorial pays tribute to more
than 3,400 people who have received our
country’s highest award for military
valor.
Outside the memorial, there are four
statues, one for each of Pueblo’s Medal
of Honor recipients.
One of these men, Lt. Raymond G.
Murphy, was a U.S. marine who was
serving in Korea in 1953. After a failed
raid with heavy casualties, Lieutenant
Murphy organized and led his platoon
in a heroic rescue effort to save his fel-
low marines. Providing cover and driv-
ing back the enemy, he rescued his fel-
low men who were under intense enemy
fire. He sustained numerous wounds
but refused treatment until everyone
else had been treated. Lieutenant Mur-
phy stayed on the battlefield until
every marine was accounted for.
When President Eisenhower pre-
sented Murphy with the Medal of
Honor, he was quoted as saying:
‘‘What is it about the water out there in
Pueblo? All you guys turn out to be heroes!’’
That is our Pueblo, CO. Whatever it
is, there must be a lot of it in Colo-
rado’s water.
U.S. Army CPT Florent Groberg—an-
other Coloradan—was based out of Fort
Carson. He received the Medal of Honor
for his heroic actions in Afghanistan.
In 2012, his patrol was ambushed by an
individual wearing a suicide vest. Cap-
tain Groberg rushed to the individual
and grabbed him, driving him away
from his fellow troops and down to the
ground. The bomber’s vest exploded, se-
verely wounding Captain Groberg. He
miraculously survived the blast, and
his heroic actions and selflessness
saved many of his patrol members’
lives. His actions were certainly ex-
traordinary, and they showed the char-
acter of the men and women who serve.
They would do anything to protect
those they love.
I am also reminded of a Coloradan I
have had the honor of working with
and meeting over the last several
years. Two years ago, in fact, I had a
Veterans Day experience I will never
forget with another veteran who re-
fused to give up on his fellow brothers
and sisters in arms. I was visiting Don-
ald Stratton, who was a seaman 1st
class on the USS Arizona when the Jap-
anese launched a surprise attack on
Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
Mr. Stratton was one of the last five
remaining survivors stationed on the
USS Arizona. Since that time 2 years
ago, we have lost Lauren Bruner. There
are even fewer today than there were.
He told me how a young sailor named
Joseph George disregarded the orders
to abandon ship in order to save his life
and the other sailors. Joseph George
never received a medal for his actions,
and Donald Stratton didn’t think that
was fair. It didn’t sit well. Mr. Stratton
and I and his family worked together
to finally convince the Navy to honor
Joe George, to give this hero the rec-
ognition he deserves.
Donald Stratton’s story sticks with
me because he had already fought one
war for his country, and then he had to
spend another 16 years fighting govern-
ment bureaucracy in order to honor
the man who saved his life and the
lives of others. It is a reminder that
our veterans need our help and our sup-
port to receive the recognition and the
care they continue to deserve.
All of the stories I have shared and
the individuals I have talked about are
extraordinary, but there are so many
other—countless acts of heroism.
Every single person in our armed serv-
ices today is extraordinary. Every day,
they perform heroic acts of service and
make sacrifices that may not make the
national news or the front page of
newspapers, but we shouldn’t lose sight
of the fact that they sacrifice for our
country every day. They have put their
bodies and their minds through vig-
orous training, boot camps, and deploy-
ments. They have given up valuable
time with their loved ones. They are
away from home for months at a time,
if not longer. There are the holidays
they will never get back and the impor-
tant milestones they have missed with
their families as they placed their ci-
vilian lives on hold to serve our coun-
try. And too many people return with
wounds of war, both physical and men-
tal. All of these sacrifices and their
willingness to place their lives on the
line for the country they love add up to
a debt we can never repay—never pay
back.
I hope that the Veterans Day celebra-
tion this week serves as a reminder
that it is our responsibility to take
care of those who have taken care of
us. We owe it to our Nation’s veterans
to ensure that they can receive the
best possible care and that they have
the tools and support necessary to
navigate civilian life.
The Senate and the House have taken
great steps to improve the lives of vet-
erans and the care they receive, but we
can always do more, and we must do
more. We must do more and never give
up. We can do better than the status
quo.
For veterans living in rural areas
like the Western Slope or Eastern
Plains of Colorado, long drive times
and a shortage of doctors and nurses at
the VA facilities make it difficult to
receive the care we promised. There
has never been a fight too dangerous or
a task too difficult for these men and
women who have served our country,
and that is the approach we need to
take. We have to be in this fight to
make sure we approach veterans’ care
with the same commitment and find
creative solutions to ease the transi-
tion to civilian life, to make sure they
have the care they need, and to make
sure we have enough physicians and
nurses and doctors in these places to
provide the best possible care.
Earlier this year, I introduced my VA
Readiness Initiative, which is a com-
prehensive package of improvements
and reforms to ensure we are following
through on every one of these promises
to veterans. The VA Readiness Initia-
tive focuses on four pillars to support
veterans: expanding access to services,
encouraging innovation, VA account-
ability, and empowering transitioning
servicemembers.
It introduces more oversight and
more transparency and accountability
at VA facilities to eliminate fraud and
increase the quality of care.
In order to ease the transition to ci-
vilian life, it enhances programs that
help veterans start small businesses
and train for future careers in the
science, technology, engineering, and
math fields.
It promotes innovative approaches to
suicide prevention, which is a heart-
breaking problem in the veteran com-
munity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6593
November 14, 2019
In Colorado, we are losing one of our
own nearly every 7 hours to suicide. In
recent years, we have lost more vet-
erans to suicide than we lost in com-
bat. Think about that. We have lost
more veterans to suicide than we have
lost in combat. In Colorado, we lose
roughly 200 veterans a year to suicide.
I am working with my colleague Sen-
ator TAMMY BALDWIN from Wisconsin
to designate 9–8–8 as a national suicide
hotline that veterans and anyone else
in crisis can call when they need help.
Veterans answered our call when we
needed them; we need to answer their
call when they need us.
When somebody is suffering from a
heart attack or a medical emergency, a
crisis, we all know to call 9–1–1, but
how many people know a number to
call if they find themselves in a time of
mental health crisis? Is there a 10-digit
hotline? Yes, there is. How many peo-
ple can know that and know that now
off the top of their heads? How many
people can tell a friend in need what
that hotline number is? Let’s simplify
it. Let’s make it a three-digit number
like 9–1–1 for health crisis emergencies.
Let’s make sure we have 9–8–8 for men-
tal health needs.
The current suicide hotline number
is 10 digits long. This is an easy-to-re-
member hotline—9–8–8—to connect peo-
ple in crisis with professional help.
When a veteran is in need, a phone call
is made, and they will receive special-
ized care for veterans. Press 1 to be di-
rected to the veterans support line,
where they can receive mental health
support specific to the unique needs of
our veterans.
I also hope every veteran in Colorado
will look to our offices—my office in
Colorado and my colleagues’ offices—
Senator BENNET and others—if there is
anything we can do to help. Often-
times, too many people don’t know
about the services that can help them.
Thanks to the outpouring of veterans
who contact my office each and every
year, we were able to help open the VA
Medical Center in Aurora, CO, last
year. It was long overdue but essential
to their care and to making sure we
have the finest medical care for Colo-
radans.
Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON from Geor-
gia, chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs
Committee—somebody who is stepping
down from this Chamber at the end of
the year, and we will miss him great-
ly—was instrumental in making this
happen and will be greatly missed when
he leaves. JOHNNY is a true statesman
and a champion for our veterans. We in
Colorado are grateful for his work to
make sure that the VA hospital in Au-
rora is the crown jewel of our support
system in our State for veterans.
November is also Military Family
Appreciation Month. I certainly want
to express my gratitude to the military
families who share the burden of serv-
ice. This is not just an individual ef-
fort; it is indeed a family effort. When
one member of the family serves, the
entire family serves.
We all know this can be a difficult
time of the year. The holidays are com-
ing up for troops and their families. As
all of us celebrate Thanksgiving,
Christmas, Hanukkah, and other tradi-
tions in our families, I hope each one of
our prayers will go to a military family
in need, heroes who are placing their
dreams on hold to protect the Amer-
ican dream.
To everyone who has served this
country, thank you for the sacrifice
you have all made, and know that our
Nation is grateful. It is because of the
commitment you bring that we can
continue to live in a nation with un-
limited opportunities, a nation founded
in liberty and rooted in the principles
that inspire hope and optimism around
the world.
To every veteran, thank you from
the bottom of my heart for everything
you have done in service to our beloved
country. May God bless you, and may
God bless this great United States of
America as you continue to serve and
as we continue to serve you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr.
YOUNG). The Senator from Ohio.
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, Mon-
day was Veterans Day, and it gave us
all the opportunity to come together as
Republicans and Democrats and Inde-
pendents alike to express our immense
gratitude to our veterans for putting
on the uniform of the United States on
behalf of our great country and on be-
half of all of us.
I just listened to my colleague from
Colorado talk about our cherished vet-
erans and their service. He is a cham-
pion for our veterans. He is absolutely
right—our veterans need to be at the
front of the line for healthcare and get-
ting access to the best care possible.
That hasn’t always been the case. We
have made some improvements in the
last few years, and those are now being
implemented. They are not perfect, but
thankfully it is much better. I heard
that over Veterans Day.
He also talked about our families.
The families of veterans also make sac-
rifices, and sometimes we forget that.
In the last several years, as the up-
tempo has been a little higher and fam-
ilies have had to sacrifice even more,
we are particularly grateful for those
families.
The Presiding Officer today is one of
our veterans in the Chamber. As a ma-
rine, he has served our country with
distinction, and we appreciate him and
all the other veterans here in the Sen-
ate.
In my home State of Ohio, we have
850,000 veterans, roughly. It makes us a
State that is particularly proud. We
are a State that has produced some of
the great American fighting men and
women heroes, from Ulysses S. Grant
to Neil Armstrong.
When I go to veterans’ events, I am
just inspired and overwhelmed by the
families and the veterans I get to meet.
On Veterans Day, I was in Blue Ash,
OH, at a memorial that has been set
aside for our veterans. It was a wonder-
ful day in Blue Ash, but every day of
the year this memorial park is there,
and it is beautiful. It commemorates
veterans from every single war. There
are 11 soldiers, sailors, marines, and
airmen who are representing each of
the conflicts America has been engaged
in, all the way from the American Rev-
olution to the heroes of the Global War
on Terror. Behind a description of each
of those conflicts is a separate statue
of a fighting man or woman. Most im-
portantly to me, on Monday, on the
other side of those statues, were the
veterans. They were there from every
conflict—from World War II and right
up to those soldiers who have recently
come back from Afghanistan.
Today, as we are here on the floor
talking about our great veterans, there
are soldiers, marines, sailors, and air-
men on Active Duty in places all
around the world, including in Syria,
Afghanistan, and Iraq.
After this event in Blue Ash, OH, I
then went to Columbus, OH, and had
the opportunity to go to the National
Veterans Memorial and Museum. This
is a new, spectacular museum outside
of Columbus, OH. It is something we
are very proud of in Ohio. I took the
lead in the Senate to try to be sure
that we had the national designation.
We have that now. It is the National
Veterans Memorial and Museum. It
was funded almost entirely with pri-
vate sector dollars. Over $75 million
was raised just from the private sector
in the Columbus-Central Ohio area.
President Trump signed the legislation
into law last year to designate it as the
national memorial.
It is a beautiful way to pay tribute to
our veterans, mostly by stories. You
walk in, and there are story boards
about different veterans’ experiences.
The facility itself is inspiring—one of
the finest architectural designs, we are
told, in the country the year it was
built.
When I went around and thanked vet-
erans at this memorial, I heard the
same thing I heard in Blue Ash and
that I hear every time I thank a vet-
eran, which is more or less this: Thank
you for your service. The response
being: I was just doing my job. I was
just doing my duty.
Duty. I am the son of a World War II
veteran and the grandson of a World
War I veteran. ‘‘Duty’’ is a word I
heard a lot growing up and ‘‘service’’
and ‘‘honor.’’ For our country today,
those words are very important to re-
member.
Our veterans have played a key role
in ensuring we have the freedoms we
too often take for granted, but also
there is a culture around veterans that
we need to hear more and more of
today, and we need to be sure more of
our young people are hearing, which is
this notion that service beyond self is
important; that duty, honor, and sac-
rifice are part of the fundamental val-
ues of our country.
The fact that we have had such sup-
port for our veterans, to me, ought also

to be translated into support for those
who are on Active Duty, because when
I talk to our veterans about their con-
cerns—yes, they talk about healthcare
or disability and other issues that my
office helps veterans with every day,
and we are proud to do that—what they
also tell me is that they want to be
sure we are taking care of the troops.
They want to be sure we are honoring
our veterans by ensuring that the men
and women in uniform today, who are
out on the frontlines for all of us, are
getting the support they need from the
U.S. Congress.
Unfortunately, we are letting them
down right now, whether it is with the
National Defense Authorization Act—
which is still in conference, which nor-
mally is a bipartisan bill that gets
done quickly and that establishes the
framework for how we provide readi-
ness and how we provide the right
weapons, being sure our soldiers, ma-
rines, airmen, and sailors have the very
best—but, secondly, we are not even
providing the funding bill this year.
We have tried. We have brought it to
the floor of the Senate, and we have
asked for a vote on it. We have not
been able to get that vote. So right
now we are operating on what is called
a continuing resolution, which is not
good for the military.
I was at the Youngstown Air Reserve
Station last week, which is a reserve
unit in Ohio that provides airlift capa-
bility and a spray mission for our mili-
tary. They have about 1,500 airmen sup-
port people and pilots there. They are
very worried about the continuing res-
olution and its impact. They can’t plan
for training exercises. They can’t plan
for upgrades in their equipment to
keep the cutting-edge technology they
want to have for the safety of their pi-
lots and the crews.
I also heard, of course, a lot about
the possibility of a government shut-
down and how devastating that would
be for our military. Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base is in Ohio. That is their
top concern.
Unfortunately, I will tell you that al-
though our highest priority here in the
Senate ought to be ensuring that at a
minimum our troops have what they
need, we haven’t done that this year.
I would urge my colleagues on both
sides: Lets’s figure out how to do what
we typically do here, which is, if we
can’t agree on everything in the spend-
ing bills, let’s at least agree on pro-
viding this funding for our troops.
By the way, it is particularly impor-
tant this year because in that funding
is a pay raise for the troops that they
need badly. It is very important for
Ohio.
I said earlier that we are one of those
States that is proud of all the veterans
who live there and all of the people
from Ohio who have stood up and
served their country, but we are also
proud of our military facilities. De-
fense spending now accounts for 66,000
direct jobs in Ohio, more than $4 bil-
lion in salaries, and more than $14 bil-
lion of positive economic impact
spread out over our 88 counties in Ohio.
We have some great facilities. I men-
tioned Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base and the Youngstown Air Reserve
Station. We also have the Joint Sys-
tems Manufacturing Center in Lima,
OH, which is the place where we make
our tanks. During the Obama adminis-
tration, that facility was nearly shut
down. A bunch of us led the fight, and
I led the fight here in the Senate to
keep it open. Thank goodness we did.
Today, we need it. We need to be pro-
ducing these tanks. We need to push
back against the threats that we see.
Our Army wants these vehicles—ar-
mored vehicles—including Strykers
and tanks. We are very proud of that
facility in Ohio. We want to be sure
that we have the funding for it so we
can move forward. In this appropria-
tions bill there is funding for new
tanks and new Stryker vehicles.
At the spray facility I talked about
at the Youngstown Air Reserve Sta-
tion, they need new airplanes. They
need to have upgrades. Right now they
need to be sure that the funding we
have in this appropriations bill goes
through because it actually enables
them to construct a gate for the facil-
ity that is safe. The homeland security
folks have told them that their current
gate does not protect the base prop-
erly. So we have funding in this legisla-
tion to be able to do that.
I remain concerned that we are not
coming together, as we do for our vet-
erans, for our Active Duty.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle have repeatedly blocked these
procedural motions to move the bill
forward, but their disagreements seem
to be more with broader issues—how
we are going to fund other issues,
maybe including the wall on the south-
west border—from what they say. Let’s
deal with that bill separately, but let’s
not take it out on our troops. Let’s not
make our troops a pawn in these polit-
ical fights.
The funding bill we have was drafted
on a bipartisan basis. It also is bi-
cameral, in the sense that the House
bill for Defense appropriations this
year is very similar to the Senate bill.
The United States and the defense
framework we have built over the
years with our allies is under siege in
places like Iran, China, North Korea,
Turkey, and Russia. While we fight
over funding our defense this year,
their arsenals—those countries’ arse-
nals—continue to grow.
I have heard from every branch of the
military on this. Again, they all say
the same thing: Failing to pass this
funding agreement and defaulting to a
continuing resolution—God forbid we
go to a government shutdown, but even
a continuing resolution where the
funding wouldn’t increase—negatively
affects their ability to carry out their
missions.
For the Army, by the way, that
means delaying procurement of critical
equipment, like their Next Generation
Combat Vehicle and land-based
hypersonic missiles. But it also means
more than 4,000 military family and
single-soldier dwellings would not be
awarded to servicemembers, and that
nearly 300 military housing units in
desperate need of repair will not get
the upkeep they need.
For the Navy, they tell me failing to
pass the appropriations bill will mean
delaying the start of 3 dozen new crit-
ical military construction projects,
and it creates a nearly $2 billion short-
fall for research and development,
among other things. By the way, that
includes holding research into artifi-
cial intelligence development, or AI de-
velopment, which is critical right now.
China is making great strides in that
area. We have to be sure we are more
than keeping up.
For the Air Force, they tell me this
funding is necessary to field the new F–
15EX fighter plane, to maintain and
improve, of course, the F–35 fleet, and
to help recruit and train new pilots to
operate these state-of-the-art aircraft.
In Ohio, a CR would negatively im-
pact our operations at Wright-Patter-
son and the critical work we do for our
Nation at NASIC, which is a counter-
intelligence operation, among other
things.
Again, failing to pass the agreement
will also keep us from moving forward
with the across-the-board 3.1-percent
pay increase for our troops, which is
key to ensuring they are fairly com-
pensated for their hard work and the
sacrifices we have talked about today.
It would be the largest pay raise in a
decade, and they shouldn’t be pre-
vented from getting it because of our
political differences here on other
issues.
Anyone who has read the Constitu-
tion will tell you that the very first
stated purpose of the Federal Govern-
ment is to ‘‘provide for the common de-
fense.’’ That is our fundamental re-
sponsibility here. If we can’t put aside
these partisan disagreements and reach
an agreement to fund our Armed
Forces, we are failing to carry out
those duties.
I hope it doesn’t come to that. I hope
politics can be put aside, and we can
agree soon to give our men and women
in uniform the comprehensive support
they need, because when you meet vet-
erans, as I did on Veterans Day across
our State, you can’t help but wonder
where they would be if they didn’t have
the funding they needed when they
were out there putting their lives on
the line for all of us.
Again, to honor our veterans, we also
have to honor our Active Duty. It is
critical to our men and women in uni-
form, and it is critical to our national
security.
I yield back.

ator from Pennsylvania.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6595
November 14, 2019
REMEMBERING KAY HAGAN
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise
today to recount the life of a colleague
who recently passed away, Senator Kay
Hagan from the State of North Caro-
lina. I wish I didn’t have to stand here
to talk about her in the past tense. So
many people who have served in the
Senate with Kay Hagan, so many staff
people across the Senate—and, in the
context of both Members and staff, I
would say both parties—recall serving
with her fondly and also were very sad-
dened by her passing.
It is very difficult to encapsulate
someone’s personality or their life in a
few short remarks, but you could not
have met Kay Hagan even for a short
period of time or worked with her even
for a short period of time without
being captivated by her spirit, her en-
ergy, and her optimism, not only about
her life but about work. You could also
be captivated by her ability to connect
with people and to demonstrate the
kind of uncommon decency that we
don’t see enough of in politics and even
public service. We are going to miss
that energy, that optimism, and that
decency. We are also going to miss her
commitment to public service, even
when she was not an elected public offi-
cial.
My remarks today will not in any
way encapsulate her whole life or her
life of service, but I will try to provide
some reflections.
One thing you knew about Kay
Hagan when she got to the Senate was
that she was very clear about the peo-
ple she represented in the State from
which she came. If you were in a short
conversation with her or a long con-
versation—even a 30-second conversa-
tion—you were likely to hear the two
words, ‘‘North Carolina,’’ if not once in
a short conversation, several times.
She was so proud of her State and so
proud of the opportunities she had to
represent the people of North Carolina.
She, of course, understood her work
and was faithful to the basic obligation
to represent the Nation as well. She
was fiercely loyal to and always con-
cerned about the people of North Caro-
lina.
She was a fierce advocate for work-
ing people in North Carolina and
around the country. She also happened
to serve at a time when the Senate was
considering and then, ultimately, took
a vote on the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act. At that time, it
was a long debate and a lot of conten-
tion, obviously, and there still is on
healthcare. But Kay Hagan was very
clear about where she stood.
We happened to serve as members of
the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee, known by the acro-
nym HELP—one of the two committees
in the Senate that considered
healthcare. Both the HELP Committee
and the Finance Committee had fierce
debate about and then, ultimately,
votes on the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act.
Here is what Senator Kay Hagan said
when the HELP Committee approved
similar or, I should say, related legisla-
tion, which at that time was called the
Affordable Health Choices Act. That
was the original healthcare bill that
went through that committee, the
HELP Committee. It ultimately
changed when it was considered by the
Finance Committee and then by the
whole Senate, and the changes were
made in negotiation and deliberation
with the House.
But here is what she said. I guess this
would have been sometime in 2009. She
talked about this one particular
healthcare bill as it stood at that mo-
ment. She said:
Our bill also ensures that a pre-existing
condition will not prevent you from getting
coverage. This compromise package focuses
on prevention and wellness, which will keep
our nation healthier and save taxpayers’
money in the long run. I will continue work-
ing with my colleagues to get reform legisla-
tion to the President that stabilizes costs,
expands coverage and improves the quality
of care for all Americans.
That is what Senator Kay Hagan said
at the time. Of course, we are still
wrestling with a lot of those issues.
She was predicting, in a sense, some of
our future debates.
Kay Hagan wanted to get things done
for the people she represented and real-
ly for the American people. One of the
areas where she demonstrated that
commitment to leadership and that
commitment to getting things done
was in the area of children’s issues. In
that same committee, the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee, she was the chair of the Sub-
committee on Children and Families.
Later, I was able to follow in her foot-
steps.
That was so emblematic of Kay
Hagan’s service not to be concerned
just about what is right in front of us—
the issue of the day or the issue of the
moment, as important as those issues
are—but always thinking about what
comes next, always focusing on the fu-
ture, thinking about the future, and
not just in a compassionate way, as it
relates to children, but in a very stra-
tegic way. Kay Hagan knew that in-
vesting in our children was essential
for building the economy of the future
and having the kind of country we say
we want to have.
So Kay Hagan was ahead of her time
in that regard, focusing on America’s
future, which meant focusing on Amer-
ica’s children—whether it was financial
literacy and the curriculum for middle
and high school students or whether it
was from her earliest days in the Sen-
ate—to improve the lives of children in
any way that she could.
When I think about Kay Hagan, I
think of not just a Senator, not just a
colleague and a friend, but a public
servant, someone who cared very deep-
ly about service. I have often quoted
the inscription on a building in which I
worked in the State capital of Pennsyl-
vania—Harrisburg. It is called the Fi-
nance Building, and I served in that
building for 10 years and worked in
that building for 10 years. The inscrip-
tion on that building about public serv-
ice is very simple. It says: ‘‘All public
service is a trust given in faith and ac-
cepted in honor.’’ That is what it says
in that inscription. It is a great sum-
mation of what public service must be
about and what an election must be
about, that public service is a trust
that is given to one person, given to a
group of people, and that trust must be
honored by the service that you render.
Here is another way of saying it by a
predecessor of Kay Hagan, in a sense,
because she was a Member of the Sen-
ate and, at the time, a real pioneer for
women in the Senate. Margaret Chase
Smith once said:
Public service must be more than doing a
job efficiently and honestly. It must be a
complete dedication to the people and to the
nation.
That is what Senator Margaret Chase
Smith once said, and I think Kay
Hagan’s service was totally consistent
with that sentiment, that public serv-
ice is more than just doing a job hon-
estly and efficiently, as Senator Smith
said at the time. It must be a complete
dedication to the people in the Nation.
Kay Hagan demonstrated that in her
life and in her work.
I have joined so many Members of
the Senate in expressing condolence
and also commendation for the good
work that she did. I express condo-
lence, of course, to her family. I speak
on behalf of my wife Terese and many
people here in the Senate who served
with Kay to offer condolence to Kay’s
husband Chip and to her three chil-
dren—Jeanette, Tilden, and Carrie—
and Kay’s five grandchildren. We are
thinking of them today and all these
days since her passing, and we pray
that she will rest in peace. I express
again how much we will miss Kay
Hagan not only in the Senate but also
because of the person she was. God
bless you, Kay.
With that, I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6597
November 14, 2019
President Bill Clinton’s decision to
evacuate American troops from the
Horn of Africa.
Somalia’s legacy is rooted in years of
violence that overwhelmed the world’s
most elite military forces, froze the
economy, and left the Somali people
very much alone in the world—at least
until 9/11, when Western powers were
forced to focus on multiple fronts in
the War on Terror.
I was fortunate enough last weekend
to visit our Djibouti-based troops at
Camp Lemonnier. Our base there was
established in the wake of 9/11, and
since then, has expanded to support
AFRICOM’s mission in the Horn of Af-
rica. Their leadership is committed to
not repeating the mistakes of the past.
They have developed the best un-
manned aerial system force in the
world.
It is amazing what they are doing
with these UAVs. Between that pro-
gram and our impressive intelligence
surveillance and reconnaissance capa-
bilities, the military has stepped up
their ability to keep our troops safer in
the world’s most volatile theater.
I was pleased to know that the 101st
Airborne out of Fort Campbell—which
is located in Montgomery County, TN,
and also there on the Kentucky bor-
der—are supporting the vital post-
Benghazi East Africa Response Force
mission and that the Nashville-based
118th Air Wing unit of the Tennessee
Air National Guard plays a vital role in
regional security operations.
It brought home to me the point of
why we have to get the NDAA finished,
why we have to get these resources to
our men and women in uniform who
are fighting every day and need 21st-
century warfare in order to keep us
safe.
The work they are doing there—and
of course I can’t say exactly what it is
that they are doing—should make us
all really humbled and grateful for
those who choose to serve.
Our mission in Africa is changing.
Things are shifting a little bit. As we
urge our local partners in Africa to
take ownership over their own secu-
rity, the chattering class is at it again
and what we will hear from people is:
Well, I think we have done enough for
Africa. Don’t you think we have given
enough?
My response this week to those who
have made that statement has been:
No, we have not done enough. We have
invested more than a decades’ worth of
time, money, and manpower. We have
lost men, lost ground, regained that
ground, expanded our abilities, and
have achieved moderate regional sta-
bility. But most importantly, we have
confirmed the Horn of Africa is still a
geopolitical powder keg.
The same forces that swept the Horn
into anarchy in the 1990s and allowed
terrorism to metastasize in the 2000s
are now triggering instability all
across that continent.
For a long time, Somalia managed to
limp along as a failed state because a
traditional government has never acted
as their main arbiter. Powerful clans
decided for themselves who would con-
trol territory and resources, and the
clans are still very evident in that
country. The victors, in turn,
weaponized access to clean water, food,
and healthcare in order to keep citi-
zens in line.
Violent extremist organizations like
al-Shabaab, ISIS, and factions of al-
Qaida have been watching, and now
they are employing the same tactics to
destabilize existing governments in and
beyond the Horn, in northeast Nigeria,
and in the Sahel and the Lake Chad re-
gions of West Africa.
We may have eradicated the physical
caliphate, but mom-and-pop terror
shops are thriving. What is more, the
digital caliphate is alive and well, and
it will take more than ground forces to
wipe it out.
Many of my colleagues may be
tempted to assume that these insur-
gent hotbeds have lowered Africa’s
stock in the eyes of global powers, but
we shouldn’t be fooled about that in
this era of great power competition. It
is going to sound mighty familiar to all
of us, but China and, to a lesser extent,
Russia are doing all they can to actu-
ally buy their way into strategic domi-
nance. This is some of what we heard
and what we learned this week. For ex-
ample, China has made inroads by
agreeing to hold 80 percent of the gov-
ernment of Djibouti’s debt. Think
about that. China has gone to this
country and they have said: Look, we
will hold this debt for you, 80 percent
of it.
In turn, Djibouti has accommodated
China’s first overseas military outpost
and granted them access to crucial
shipping lanes. They have also bought
into China’s Smart City Program,
those all-seeing cameras that I encoun-
tered at every intersection at Djibouti
City. In other words, the Chinese must
feel like they have struck gold. They
have a huge port going in. They are
helping to turn this into an intermodal
transit system with a port, with a rail-
way. By the way, we are going to put
these cameras up to help you keep your
community safe. And what is China
doing? China is collecting all that data.
They are scanning all of these faces.
They are watching everything that
comes into these ports and are moni-
toring everything that goes on the
rails.
China is doing this not only with
Djibouti but with other countries in
Africa. They are trying to secure this
coastline in Africa for themselves to
expand their reach.
For 12 years, the United States and
our partners have worked together to
bring stability to the Horn of Africa.
The State Department and USAID have
laid the groundwork for education, for
health development, institution build-
ing, and permanent democratic transi-
tion. Yet the region remains vulner-
able. Our role is going to change be-
cause, yes, we look at it as great power
competition through the military. But
we also look at the way China and Rus-
sia are pushing into their economic
sectors. Great power competition is not
just playing out in the Indo-Pacific or
in Eastern Europe; it is playing out
right now on the African Continent. In-
stead of playing defense, as we do in
other theaters, we have the oppor-
tunity to be on offense when it comes
to Africa.
If we decide that now we have had
enough, these threats—from the mili-
tary, that sector, and from the eco-
nomic sector—will degrade American
influence and will threaten the home-
land and will imperil the delicate and
completely reversible balance that we
have fought so hard to gain. Our Na-
tion’s security cannot afford to give
ground, to cede ground, on the Con-
tinent of Africa.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
BRAUN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
AMERICA RECYCLES DAY
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise to
talk about something that is really im-
portant, I think not only to our Nation
and our planet but to me and my fam-
ily personally.
As cochair and cofounder, along with
Senator JOHN BOOZMAN of Arkansas, of
the Senate Recycling Caucus, I am
proud to stand side by side with all the
Members of our caucus on the matter
of recycling and its importance.
Today Senator BOOZMAN and I have
introduced a resolution to commemo-
rate tomorrow, November 15, as Amer-
ica Recycles Day. I would say that
every day should be America Recycles
Day. For a lot of our families, that is
what it is. I don’t have any idea how
many millions or tens of millions of
families recycle every day, but it is a
lot of people, and we need even more.
For more than two decades, commu-
nities across our country have come to-
gether on November 15, and they do so
to observe America Recycles Day and
to celebrate their commitment to recy-
cling.
First, I want to thank all of those
who have worked hard to make Amer-
ica Recycles Day a success for all of
these years. I have been a huge advo-
cate of recycling for the past 50 years.
I first recycled, I think, when I was a
lieutenant JG in the Navy stationed in
Moffett Field in California, which is
close to Palo Alto. I took my
recyclables to a warehouse there in
Palo Alto and have never stopped. I
don’t go to the one in Palo Alto any-
more, but we recycle all over Delaware.
Frankly, when I go around the country,
I recycle. I recycled on the train this
morning, somewhere around Baltimore,
coming down from Wilmington.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6598 November 14, 2019
I really welcomed the opportunity to
collaborate—I want to say more than a
decade ago—with Senator Olympia
Snowe of Maine. Together, we helped
create the Senate Recycling Caucus in
2006. Since the retirement of Senator
Snowe 6 years ago, I have been fortu-
nate enough to have as my running
mate and cochair Senator BOOZMAN of
Arkansas.
In this year alone, our caucus has
held four briefings to learn more about
the current state of recycling in this
country and to discuss ways in which
the Federal Government might play an
even more important role in encour-
aging additional recycling in the years
to come.
The State and local governments are
heavily involved in recycling, and
there is a huge role for them—I say
this as former Governor—a huge and
important role for State and local gov-
ernments to be involved in this, but
there are also opportunities for the
Federal Government to play a con-
structive role. We are doing that, and
hopefully we will be able to do that
even better in the days to come.
My sister and I were born in a coal
mining town in West Virginia. We grew
up later on in Virginia, where I was a
Boy Scout and a Civil Air Patrol cadet.
In scouting, we were taught to ‘‘leave
no trace.’’ When we were hunting or
fishing, my dad, a big hunter and fish-
erman, used to say basically to leave
no trace behind so no one would actu-
ally know we were there. I think that
admonition is one that has stuck with
me throughout my life.
I believe we have a moral obligation
to be devoted stewards of our environ-
ment and our planet and to leave our
planet in even better shape than we
found it.
Lately, I have been thinking about
another quote. This one I really like is
from Martin Luther King that a lot of
people have heard. It goes something
like this: ‘‘Everybody can be great, be-
cause anybody can serve.’’ This call to
service reminds me of recycling be-
cause almost anyone can help better
protect our environment by reducing
the waste we produce, and we can do
that, in part, by recycling.
I have a chart here that indicates
just some of the things I recycled of
late. This is not a green Ford Explorer.
I bought my wife a car—actually, she
bought it years and years ago, probably
15 years ago. We call it the Ford ‘‘ex-
ploder.’’ It never exploded. It was a
great car. She used it for 9 or 8 years or
so and passed it down to our son, Chris-
topher. He used it for a couple of years
and passed it down to Ben, who used it
for about 3 years. Finally, it just gave
up the ghost. I took it one day to a
place where they recycled cars. I drove
in. They put it on a huge machine that
actually weighed it. I think of—you
know, you get on a scale to weigh your-
self. Well, this was like a scale for ve-
hicles, including our Ford Explorer.
They wrote out a check literally before
I left to actually pay, I think $900, for
recycling the Explorer. People do that
every day in Delaware and other places
as well.
We have a waste facility in our State
of Delaware, and one of the things they
oversee is recycling. About every
month, from spring to the fall, they
hold recycling events. A lot of times
they are in school parking lots, maybe
high school parking lots. They do them
on Saturdays.
One Saturday I called ahead, and I
asked: Do you guys recycle dehumidi-
fiers? We had a dehumidifier. It was
about 20 years old. It had been in our
basement forever. They said: Yes, we
do that—which is great, and we
checked on paints, paint thinners, oil-
based paints, and stuff. They said: We
are doing hazardous materials recy-
cling. So I took several cans of paint
thinners.
We had all these outdoor lights from
our house over the years that kind of
died out on us, and I didn’t know what
to do with them. Sure enough, they
took these household lights, as well as
all kinds of cords and everything,
paints and stuff.
Every Monday in my neighborhood,
we have big canisters outside where we
can recycle all kinds of things. I al-
ways had water bottles in there and
other kinds of cans and so forth, news-
papers, you name it—actually, compost
too. If you actually add up what we put
in our big recycling bin every Monday
for pickup, you look at what we put in
our compost in our backyard, and you
compare that to the actual amount of
trash that is picked up at our house on
Thursdays, there are many times more
recyclables and compostables than
there is actually trash.
We like to do that where I live. Hope-
fully, we will learn from other commu-
nities and States, and hopefully they
will learn from us.
One of the reasons I love recycling so
much flows from my belief that all of
us can do our part to preserve limited
resources and reduce landfill input,
while at the same time helping our en-
vironment and creating jobs.
Mine is a little State. I tell people,
even today, that we are the 49th largest
State. That means only Rhode Island is
smaller than us. We are about 100 miles
long and 50 miles wide, so recycling is
particularly important. We just doesn’t
have a lot of space for landfills. We
have about 1 million people, and it is
just a matter of having enough space.
That space limitation is actually what
prompted Delaware to pass the Uni-
versal Recycling Law in 2010. It re-
quires that all waste haulers who pro-
vide residential trash collection also
have to provide for the collection of
recyclables. Think about that. That
was the law we passed about 9 years
ago, I think under the leadership of ei-
ther Governor Markell or Governor
Minner. We started a little bit of recy-
cling. We started getting serious about
it when I was Governor. They really
ramped it up in the last decade, which
is wonderful.
Since the law’s passage, the First
State—that is Delaware, if you didn’t
know—has continued to recycle some-
where around 40 percent of all of our
waste, most recently recycling a little
bit more than 43 percent in 2017.
I have a friend who, when you ask
him how he is doing, he sometimes re-
plies: Compared to what? Well, com-
pared to more than a decade ago, in
2006, the First State diverted about
half as much—23 percent of our waste
from landfills. So we pretty much dou-
bled that over the last 10 years. Hope-
fully, we will come close to doubling it
again in the years to come.
Today the recycling industry faces
unprecedented challenges, especially
with respect to plastics. The United
States used to ship a lot of our
recyclables, as you know, to China, but
beginning in 2017, China decided to ban
24 types of what are called scrap im-
ports and deployed strict contamina-
tion requirements for the scraps they
will accept. They didn’t want to have
glass mixed up with metals, mixed up
with plastic and paper. They are look-
ing to reduce contamination like that,
and they made their rules a whole lot
stricter in that regard.
Now, because of the policies China
implemented in March of this year,
local governments and municipalities
are facing an uphill challenge to keep
their recycling programs alive. Accord-
ing to the EPA, the United States recy-
cles less than 22 percent of our dis-
carded materials, which makes me feel
better in Delaware because we are like
twice the national average now.
According to a peer-reviewed study
published in 2017, more than 90 percent
of plastic has never been recycled. Let
me say that again. According to a peer-
reviewed study published in 2017—2
years ago—more than 90 percent of
plastic has never been recycled. That
means we have only recycled about 9
percent of our plastic around the
world. Of the 8.3 billion metric tons of
plastic produced, 6.3 billion tons—that
is about three-fourths of all that is pro-
duced—becomes waste. The rest gets
recycled; the lion’s share of it does not.
Most of it ends up in landfills, and too
much of it, unfortunately, ends up in
our oceans and environment.
I have a couple of our colleagues on
the Environment and Public Works
Committee. The Presiding Officer is
one of them, and we have Senator
BOOZMAN. The three of us are all mem-
bers on the committee. I think Senator
DAN SULLIVAN from Alaska and Sen-
ator SHELDON WHITEHOUSE—a Repub-
lican and a Democrat—have been work-
ing hard, along with TOM UDALL from
New Mexico, who is on the Commerce
Committee, to try to address some of
these plastic contaminations.
If we continue down this path, the
world economic forum predicts that we
are on track to have plastic pollution
in our oceans outweigh the fish in our
world’s ocean by 2050. Let that sink in
for just a minute. By 2050, if we con-
tinue on the track we are on, we are

going to end up having more plastic
pollution by weight than fish in our
world’s oceans. That is not a good
thing.
Last time I checked, Delaware is
blessed with more five-star beaches
than any other State in America. If we
don’t begin to change our recycling
habits, the waves that grace our pris-
tine beaches will be better known for
washing up plastic waste than giving
surfers those big waves to ride.
Almost every year I participate in
something called Delaware’s Annual
Coastal Cleanup, along with thousands
of people. We start down at Fenwick Is-
land—right in the southernmost part of
Delaware, a great beach town, and
right north of the Ocean City, MD,
line—to clean up our beaches and our
waterfronts, from the Delaware and
Maryland line all the way up almost to
Pennsylvania in the north.
While we are still waiting for the
numbers from this year, last year, in
2018, my fellow volunteers and I—thou-
sands of us—together collected 2.7 tons
of waste, including plastic water bot-
tles, straws, takeout containers, tires,
and you name it. This was from just
one weekend of work along 70 miles of
coastline.
Sadly, those 2.7 tons of trash col-
lected last year in Delaware pale in
comparison to what we are seeing
around the world. Our 2.7 tons of trash
is like the tip of the iceberg, compared
to all the rest of this washing up in
places around the world.
I think we might have one more
chart. Some of you have also heard of
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,
which now covers a surface area on the
Earth 250 times larger than my whole
State of Delaware and contains a whop-
ping 80,000 tons of trash. Here it is. Can
you imagine? Look at all that trash.
It is out in the Pacific Ocean, and I
would like to say that it is getting
smaller. I don’t think it is, but it needs
to, and we need to be a part of that in
making some progress.
As we celebrate America Recycles
Day tomorrow, I just want to encour-
age you to join Senator BOOZMAN and
join our colleagues and their constitu-
ents and join us in looking for new
ways to dramatically increase recy-
cling in our country and around the
world. We need solutions that are a
win-win for our economy on the one
hand and for our environment on the
other hand. I believe recycling is one of
those win-win solutions.
By the way, you may be surprised to
learn that recycling and manufac-
turing industries are beneficial for our
economy, accounting for more than
750,000 jobs and approximately $6.7 bil-
lion in tax revenues. That reminds me
of one of my favorite sayings: ‘‘It is
possible to do good and to do well at
the same time.’’ It is possible to clean
up our planet and make the planet
safer and create jobs and economic op-
portunities.
It is not a Hobson’s choice. It is not
one or the other. We can do both. I be-
lieve that if we work hard, we work to-
gether, and we work to leverage points
of consensus rather than points of dis-
agreement, we will continue to make
progress. Recycling is something that I
think every American can do to make
a difference.
I once read somewhere how many
aluminum cans we drink and use and
consume. It could be tea, it could be
soda, it could be milk or variety of
waters, but if people just would recycle
their aluminum cans, it would have a
terrific effect on, believe it or not, car-
bon dioxide. It is put up in the air. So
that affects climate change as well.
There are a lot of good effects. Recy-
cling is something that every Amer-
ican can do to make a difference. I
would ask you to start today. If you
have already gotten started, figure out
how to do better. On America Recycles
Day, our children and our grand-
children will be glad that we did it in
the years to come.
Again, I am grateful to be here today
with my dedicated cochair, my
compadre, Senator BOOZMAN. I thank
him for his leadership and for pro-
viding, with our staff, great ideas to
make this particular America Recycles
Day an even bigger and better thing
than before.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas.
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I
thank Senator CARPER and his staff
and my staff for the tremendous job
that they have done in recent years in
really trying to educate, through the
caucus, the rest of the staff and Mem-
bers as to the importance of recycling.
As a result of their efforts, it really is
making a big difference.
We hear a lot about Republicans and
Democrats not getting along on this
and that, not getting anything done,
and I think this is a great example of
something that is very, very impor-
tant. It is not glamourous, but it is
things like this that really can make a
huge difference, as Senator CARPER al-
luded to. We appreciate him and appre-
ciate his friendship.
Well, tomorrow, November 15, is
America Recycles Day. So we are ask-
ing Americans to join us as we come
together and reaffirm the importance
and the benefits of recycling on this oc-
casion. We all know that recycling is a
commonsense way for us to be respon-
sible stewards of our environment. Re-
cycling also strengthens our economy
and creates hundreds of thousands of
well-paying jobs throughout our coun-
try. This is something that I believe
everyone can agree is truly a win-win
situation.
Most Americans are familiar with
traditional recycling efforts at their
city and county levels, which encour-
age citizens to recycle household goods
or business goods, such as paper, soda
cans, and bottles. However, recycling is
much broader than these common prac-
tices. Recycling is a $200 billion indus-
try in our country, and it entails much,
much more than just traditional mu-
nicipal recycling programs.
My State of Arkansas is home to
many examples of companies that are
contributing to a robust and growing
commercial recycling industry. I will
give you an example.
Nucor, a leading steel producer lo-
cated in Blytheville, AR, has the ca-
pacity to recycle 6 million tons of steel
per year—6 million tons—and over 27
million tons nationwide, making it
North America’s largest recycler.
Nucor has also taken its efforts a step
further by teaming with local recycling
facilities to help tackle some of the
biggest challenges associated with the
practice in rural communities.
Nucor donated a recycled cardboard
baler to Abilities Unlimited, a local
nonprofit that runs a nearby recycling
facility. This investment has proven
mutually beneficial to Nucor and to
the community. This facility now pro-
vides an outlet for the steel company
and community members to recycle in
a much more cost-effective manner.
In fact, Nucor plants in Arkansas
have the capability to recycle about 60
tons of cardboard annually thanks to
this baler. More than 195 tons of card-
board, 21 tons of paper, and 71 tons of
mixed plastics have been recycled
through this partnership.
Another industry leader leading the
way is Walmart. As the world’s largest
retailer, Walmart has put recycling
front and center by raising its pack-
aging standards to include more recy-
cled content and to eliminate specific
nonrecyclable packaging materials by
2020. Earlier this year, Walmart an-
nounced its intention to achieve 100
percent recyclable, reusable, or indus-
trially compostable packaging by 2025.
Its leadership in this arena will help to
create more demand for recycled con-
tent and open the door for other com-
panies to follow suit.
Lastly, I want to highlight the recy-
cling accomplishments of Bryce Cor-
poration, a trailblazer in flexible pack-
aging. This is the packaging commonly
used for chips, juice pouches, pet food,
lawn and garden materials, cleaning
supplies, and many other products.
Bryce employs about 750 people at its
Searcy facility and has achieved an en-
vironmental footprint that the Central
Arkansas community can be very
proud of.
At this location alone, Bryce has
maintained a 98-percent landfill-free
status and has supported the circular
economy by recycling over 15 million
pounds of plastics each year. The mate-
rial recycled from this facility is
repurposed into other products, rang-
ing from plastic pallets to automotive
parts. Bryce Corporation’s innovative
efforts are a sterling example of recy-
cling done right, and I am grateful for
the example it has set for the rest of
the country.
Our country has certainly faced its
fair share of recycling woes and set-
backs, but I have always maintained
that in adversity lies opportunity. I be-
lieve there is much to be learned from

the meaningful work that these compa-
nies are doing in Arkansas, and I com-
mend them on leading on the issue.
The United States has the ability
now to improve its waste management
and recycling infrastructure and better
leverage the economic and environ-
mental benefits of recycling.
I look forward to continue my work
with my cochair of the Recycling Cau-
cus, Senator CARPER. Again, I thank
him and his staff and my staff, who are
doing such a tremendous job, and the
other members of the caucus who de-
velop meaningful, long-term solutions
that address the challenges facing the
industry.
I encourage all Americans to use
America Recycles Day as an oppor-
tunity to reflect on the critical impor-
tance of recycling and to consider what
we can do to support our environment
through our own individual efforts.
Mr. CARPER. Would the Senator
yield for a moment?
Mr. BOOZMAN. Yes, sir.
Mr. CARPER. Thank you for sharing
with us the terrific ideas of what busi-
nesses around Arkansas and the coun-
try are doing to recycle. They do it for
a variety of reasons. It is the right
thing to do, and a lot of them are com-
mitted to being good environmental
stewards. It can also be to their eco-
nomic advantage. Instead of having to
pay to have stuff being carted away to
a landfill, the ability to recycle mate-
rials is, I think, desirable.
We used to have a big Chrysler plant
in Delaware, in Newark, close to the
University of Delaware and close to the
Maryland line. The plant was about 60
years old, and in the middle of the
great recession, Chrysler went into
bankruptcy, and we lost that plant. It
closed, and about 3,000 jobs were gone.
We had a GM plant as well about 15
miles from there, just outside of Wil-
mington, and the same thing happened.
About 3,000 jobs were gone, which was
just really, really tough.
Having said that—in your words
again, in adversity lies opportunity—
the folks at the University of Delaware
called me. After Chrysler had gone into
bankruptcy, they announced that they
were selling the plant. They were look-
ing to sell it, and the folks at the Uni-
versity of Delaware and the president
of the university, Pat Harker, called
me and said: Do you think the Chrysler
people might be interested in selling
that plant to the university?
It was just about a half mile south of
the University of Delaware in Newark.
I called the people at Chrysler and
said: You may have an interested buyer
here.
They ended up coming to an agree-
ment on the terms of the purchase, and
that old Chrysler plant has been recy-
cled. The plant was largely taken
down—not entirely, but largely taken
down. The money that the University
of Delaware earned and generated from
the sale of the recyclables—the con-
struction stuff that the plant was made
out of—more than paid for taking down
and leveling the plant.
Now the University of Delaware has a
site of several hundred acres, and they
are redeveloping that as a science,
technology, and manufacturing facility
with a lot of tenants and more to come.
So there really is opportunity in adver-
sity.
The other thing I would say is that
we got some shredding machines. I had
a picture up there of an old shredding
machine, and we bought a new one not
long ago. So we ended up with a lot of
shredded paper. As it turns out, the
weekly recyclers, when they come
through our neighborhood and collect,
they are happy to take the paper, but
they don’t want to take the shredded
paper. What they said that we ought to
do is to put it in our compost.
My wife came up with this idea of
composting 10 years ago. Somebody
was nice enough to build a 4-by-6 and
about 3-feet high bin and then lined it
with materials, and we put grass in it,
recyclables, leaves, and we ended up
with this great mulch. We have, I
think, taken what a lot of people have
seen as waste product and ended up ac-
tually turning it into something to
make our lawn and our trees and our
shrubs even healthier.
It is all good. I am just thrilled to be
on the floor with my friend and to be
able to thank those who are recycling
and remind others, if you are not, that
you are missing out on the fun. Come
and join us. You will be glad you did.
Mr. BOOZMAN. I think you make a
great point in the sense that we do
things for the right reasons. That is so
important. Also, it is important, too,
that not only can we do it for the right
reasons and benefit our environment,
but it also can be cost-effective to our
businesses.
A good example of that is Walmart.
Several years ago, they wanted to re-
duce their fuel cost and then also re-
duce the harm in the sense of the land-
fills and things like that. They looked
and saw that on their trucks, the lim-
iting factor was not weight. It was
bulk. You know how you go to the
store and you buy something and it has
got this huge box or whatever and it
has got the little bitty product in it.
They said, you know, we don’t need to
be doing that.
So they told their vendors that they
would like to go in that direction, and
to their credit, the vendors cooperated.
As a result, they were able to put more
products on the truck, thus reducing
fuel costs—again benefiting the econ-
omy—and having less bulk for con-
sumers to deal with eventually. That
was putting less pressure on the envi-
ronment because, you know, some peo-
ple don’t do a good job of recycling.
These things can be so good for not
only doing the right thing but also im-
proving the bottom line and making
sure that we really are putting less
pressure on the environment.
We appreciate your leadership. You
have been doing this for a long time, as
Governor and now as Senator, helping
to put these things together. We very
much appreciate it.
Mr. CARPER. If the gentleman would
yield the floor for a moment, I said ear-
lier in my remarks, to paraphrase it
again, that it is possible to do good and
do well at the same time. It really is.
I am just happy that more and more
people are doing that.
While we are having this conversa-
tion, I just want to mention that when
we showed up at the recycling event at
Glascow High School last Saturday
afternoon, they took a bunch of our
stuff to recycle—papers, bottles, cans,
paint thinners, a dehumidifier, and all
kinds of stuff. One thing they wouldn’t
take was our Styrofoam. We have one
place in Delaware—and we are not a
big State; 100 miles long and 50 miles
wide—we have one place in Delaware
that will take Styrofoam.
What I would love to do in the
months to come and in the new year is
for us to start on recycling projects
and focus on that because it is not a
problem only in Delaware; there are a
lot of places where it is hard to recycle
Styrofoam. We can try to figure it out.
Maybe somebody around the world or
somebody in other States has figured
this out and they are doing it. We need
to learn from them, find out what
works, and do more of that. In my
State, we have a hard time dealing
with it.
Mr. BOOZMAN. We look forward to
having a robust bunch of programs.
It is so important to educate people
on what is recyclable because not ev-
eryone knows. Different things are re-
cyclable from one area to another area.
So we need education on that, and that
will make it much more efficient, with
people putting in the correct things.
So we have some obstacles to over-
come, but the good news is, there are
people working together, and we are
moving in the right direction.
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I think
I will yield back the time.
Mr. BOOZMAN. With that, I suggest
the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6601
November 14, 2019
50 million lives lost in the 1918 influ-
enza pandemic or the many thousands
lost in the SARS, Ebola, MERS, and
other recent infectious disease out-
breaks to recognize that far more must
be done to reduce the risk of cata-
strophic pandemics. Rather than wait-
ing until disease outbreaks occur, then
scrambling at great expense for 2 or 3
years or however long it takes to de-
velop a vaccine while countless people
die, we need to act proactively. It is
worth noting that tens of millions of
people have died, and we still lack a
vaccine against HIV.
Viral threats will continue to emerge
at a rapidly accelerating pace in re-
sponse to expanding global populations
in the least developed countries, inter-
national travel, and human encroach-
ment into wildlife habitat. And we
know that the vast majority of emerg-
ing viruses, like HIV, are zoonotic—in-
fectious diseases that can spread be-
tween animals and humans.
In an effort to strengthen global ca-
pacity for detection and discovery of
zoonotic viruses, the U.S. Agency for
International Development, USAID,
initiated the PREDICT project in 2009.
Its goal was to identify new emerging
viruses with pandemic potential and
improve predictive modeling to better
focus surveillance, data collection, and
analytics to reduce the risk of animal
viruses spilling over and spreading in
human populations. Through the col-
lection and analysis of wildlife samples
in areas of the world most at risk for
zoonotic disease, PREDICT was able to
discover disease pathogens at their
source, rather than waiting for human
infection.
Over the past decade and through its
work in more than 30 countries, PRE-
DICT has identified hundreds of viruses
and has estimated that there are more
than 1.6 million unknown viral disease
species in mammalian and avian popu-
lations, of which an estimated 600,000
to 850,000 have the potential to infect
humans. PREDICT has proven the fea-
sibility of a global, systematic viral
discovery program and paved the way
for continued progress toward a more
proactive approach to reducing pan-
demic risk.
As the PREDICT project comes to an
end next year, USAID is exploring
ways to build on its successful analyt-
ical and modeling work and is in the
process of designing the next phase of
programming to continue this critical
effort. It is my hope that others in the
international community will use the
lessons learned and techniques proven
from PREDICT to inform their own ef-
forts.
Currently, the international commu-
nity often targets global health invest-
ments on infrastructure, institutions,
and human resources. While that ap-
proach works to strengthen public
health systems and to tackle existing
diseases, reducing the risk of future
pandemics will require a substantially
different approach. As the PREDICT
project has shown, there are ways to
use data, research, and technology to
proactively identify viral threats.
Using existing health science and tech-
nology to continue to fill the knowl-
edge gap for unknown viruses will save
precious lives and dollars in the future.
Thanks to the work of USAID, we
have a strong basis of knowledge on
which to expand this critical research.
While the large pool of viral threats
lying dormant in animals has not
changed, human interaction with wild-
life has. In this increasingly globalized
and densely populated world, where it
is easier than ever for zoonotic diseases
to rapidly spread across regions and
continents, it is essential that the
international community focus on find-
ing innovative ways to reduce pan-
demic risk.
One approach is through a global
viral discovery effort, in which coun-
tries share data on previously unknown
viruses, which will transform the fight
against pandemic threats from a reac-
tive to a proactive undertaking. This is
not a technological challenge; it is
matter of political will and resources.
It will require commitments from gov-
ernments around the world to collect
and share data on previously unknown
viruses. While I recognize that is easier
said than done, better equipping hu-
manity to protect itself against cata-
strophic pandemics is an investment
we cannot afford not to make.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
SKIRACK
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont,
the Green Mountain State, is filled
with outdoor enthusiasts: people who
ski, snowboard, mountain bike, hike,
and do so much more. Outdoor enthu-
siasts who live in Chittenden County or
who have visited the area are likely to
have perused the walls, shelves, and
aisles of the Skirack in Burlington,
VT. Today I want to commemorate the
50th anniversary of the Skirack, a
small business that has become a sta-
ple of downtown Burlington.
Just a few blocks from its present lo-
cation at the corner of Main and Pine
Streets in downtown Burlington, the
Skirack first opened its doors on No-
vember 22, 1969, driven by the vision of
a group of University of Vermont stu-
dents. The founders of the Skirack—
Karen George, Zandy Wheeler, Spike
Clayton, and John George-Wheeler—
opened the shop with one goal in mind:
to provide the finest outdoor goods and
services. Over the next 50 years, their
store has equipped Vermonters and
visitors to our State with the essen-
tials as they face the elements and
reach new heights, both literal and fig-
urative.
Vermont has a proud and prominent
legacy of outdoor recreation.
Vermonters, or those who visit, can
cross country ski, swim in Lake Cham-
plain, mountain bike, or go on a trek
through any of Vermont’s magnificent
forest trails. Contrary to the store’s
name, the Skirack has been
Vermonters’ one-stop shop for all of
their outdoor recreational needs, re-
gardless of the season.
Since its inception, the Skirack has
been the recipient of numerous honors
and accolades. The store has been
named the Snowsports Retailer of the
Year and Nordic Retailer by Ski Indus-
tries of America. But recognition of
the Skirack goes far beyond their snow
sport inventory. For 5 years in a row,
from 2013 through 2017, it was named
one of America’s best bike shops by the
National Bicycle Dealers Association
and in 2018 was named one of the 20
Best Running Shops in America by
Gear Patrol.
The Skirack has gone through many
changes throughout its 50 years of op-
eration. In 1974, Karen, Zandy, Spike,
and John moved the Skirack from its
small shop on Center Street to where it
is currently located on Main Street in
downtown Burlington. Over time, they
were able to double the size of their
store by expanding to the building next
door. Then, in May 2011, they began a
special partnership with Patagonia and
opened a second store, Patagonia Bur-
lington. And today, the Skirack em-
ploys more than 80 Vermonters.
Vermont’s economy depends on small
businesses like the Skirack. Over the
years, those small businesses have be-
come the backbone of Vermont’s econ-
omy. In 2018, the more than 77,000 small
businesses made up 99 percent of
Vermont businesses—99 percent. In
Vermont, almost 60 percent of employ-
ees, over 158,000 Vermonters, are em-
ployed by a small business. I am proud
that small businesses such as The
Skirack, have not only been able to not
only survive but thrive.
With the holiday season approaching,
it is important for Americans across
the country to visit their hometown
Main Street stores as they shop for
friends and family. Holiday sales rep-
resent 20 percent of average annual
sales across most industries and 30 per-
cent or more for some businesses.
Marcelle and I congratulate Karen,
Zandy, Spike, and John on an incred-
ible 50 years of operations at the
Skirack. We wish them all the best of
luck, and we hope for 50 more strong
years.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I
rise to speak up for those who serve
our country all around the world, cou-
rageously, selflessly, with great sac-
rifice. I rise on behalf of our diplomatic
corps, our Foreign Service Officers,
civil servants, and State Department
personnel. I rise on behalf of patriotic
Americans serving our country on the
front lines of war zones and dev-
astating conflicts, in countries with
oppressive governments and societies
hostile to our own.
Our national security is stronger be-
cause of them. American people are
safer because of them. Our children’s
futures will be more secure, more pros-
perous, because of them. And because

of them and their hard work and sac-
rifice, our grandchildren may know a
world with less pain, less strife, less
conflict. And yet they have come under
attack, simply for serving their coun-
try.
This week, three State Department
witnesses are testifying during the
House of Representatives’ impeach-
ment hearings on the Trump-Ukraine
scandal. These individuals have, in
many cases, spent their entire careers
serving our Nation with distinction, on
behalf of both Republican and Demo-
cratic administrations. Some have
even worn the uniform of the U.S.
Armed Forces.
These men and women are not par-
tisans. They are patriots, patriots who
put our country first. And for putting
country first, for being willing to tell
the truth, they have come under at-
tack—not by a foreign regime bristling
at their efforts to promote democracy,
not by oligarchs and criminals who
fear their effectiveness—though that
has happened as well.
No. They have come under attack in
our own country, by our own President,
by the head of our government that
they so bravely and selflessly serve. It
pains me, and so I am standing before
you today to speak up on their behalf,
on behalf of each voice that has come
forward in this time of need and tu-
mult for our country. This is a time
when we need truth—truth above
party, truth above political loyalties
and expediency, truth above self-inter-
est. These diplomats, these profes-
sionals, these proud public servants are
putting the country before them-
selves—if only this President could do
the same, if only he—just once—could
put the interests of others ahead of his
own.
But frankly, I am not the one who
should be standing up on behalf of our
diplomatic corps, nor should it be only
the Democrats on the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. There is a job post
that actually entails standing up for
the men and women of our State De-
partment each and every day. The job
is called Secretary of State. It is a job
held by Secretary Mike Pompeo. Yet
under Secretary Pompeo’s watch, the
dedicated Americans who serve in the
State Department have been thrown to
the wolves.
Our Secretary of State should be the
No. 1 defender of our diplomatic corps.
He should come forward and tell the
American people what he saw, what he
heard, and what he did about it. He
should defend the officials who serve in
his own Department. And he could
start by uttering just one word of sup-
port for Ambassador Taylor, Deputy
Assistant Secretary Kent, and Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch. But he has had
plenty of time for that. We have seen
very clearly where he stands.
So instead, I, along with my Demo-
cratic colleagues on the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, are calling
on other senior officials at the State
Department to step up and do the right
thing. This week, we sent a letter to
the Deputy Secretary of State, John
Sullivan, and the Undersecretary for
Management, Brian Bulatao, calling on
them to do what Pompeo has not: to
publicly support the brave officials who
are putting their careers, their reputa-
tions, and terribly, even their personal
finances on the line—all to serve their
country. I hope that they do, even in
the face of vicious and unfounded at-
tacks unleashed by the President, his
allies, and those who refuse to stand up
for the truth.
Some have been called ‘‘disloyal,’’
‘‘unpatriotic,’’ and ‘‘Never Trumpers.’’
In fact, yesterday morning, as State of-
ficials were about to begin testifying,
the President tweeted, in all caps,
‘‘NEVER TRUMPERS!’’ These false at-
tacks misunderstand the entire
premise of public service. To be a ca-
reer public servant means to work
every day on behalf of the public, our
government, our country, our Con-
stitution, to check politics at the door.
To argue otherwise demonstrates this
President’s warped view of how our
government works. Our career Federal
employees do not serve him. They
serve our country. They serve the
American people.
The only ‘‘loyalty’’ they pledge is
loyalty to the oath they take to uphold
our Constitution. In coming forward, in
speaking the truth, in raising concerns
about events that trouble them as
guardians of our national security,
they are carrying out an act of selfless
patriotism and love of country that
that this President is incapable of un-
derstanding, let alone doing himself.
I hope that some of our other senior
officials will step forward and show
just a sliver of the backbone that these
individuals have shown. I hope they
will do the right thing. I hope they will
issue statements of public support for
officials courageously coming before
Congress and commit to protecting
them from retribution or reprisal.
Our State Department employees de-
serve commendation, not retaliation.
They deserve our thanks, not our
scorn. Above all else, they deserve
leaders who will defend them, not
desert them when it matters most.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LAST
GREEN VALLEY
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President,
today I rise to recognize The Last
Green Valley National Heritage Cor-
ridor as it celebrates 25 years of protec-
tion and preservation of this environ-
mentally sensitive, pristine area.
Originally designated as the
Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Val-
ley National Heritage Corridor, the
valley was officially designated as a
critical natural resource by President
Clinton on November 2, 1994. Twenty
years later, it was officially renamed
The Last Green Valley.
For a quarter of a century, The Last
Green Valley advocates have worked to
care for the corridor through nonprofit
stewardship. Overall, the valley com-
prises a 1,100-square-mile area, which
ranges from eastern Connecticut to
south-central Massachusetts. One of
the most notable aspects of the valley
is its rural characteristics despite its
proximity to three of New England’s
largest urban areas. Among its 707,000
acres, 77 percent of this range is farm-
land and forest.
The Last Green Valley’s designation
as a national heritage corridor by Con-
gress acknowledges its status as a
unique national resource. Included in
this designation are 26 towns in Con-
necticut and 9 in Massachusetts. The
underdeveloped, green area so close to
many large urban spaces makes it a
point of special ecological interest and
a great environmental asset to Con-
necticut and the nation.
Dedicated to preserving the natural
beauty and resources of New England
from development and despoilment,
The Last Green Valley sets a positive
example of environmental conservation
and protection. I applaud its accom-
plishments and hope my colleagues
will join me in congratulating The
Last Green Valley on 25 years of excel-
lence.∑

RECOGNIZING K. NEAL TRUCK AND
BUS CENTER
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, it is
with great pride that I name K. Neal
Truck and Bus Center the United
States Senate Small Business of the
Week.
K. Neal Truck and Bus Center is a
family-owned business based in Hyatts-
ville, MD. Following a decades-long ca-
reer in the grocery business, Stephen
Neal purchased a trucking business and
renamed it after his son, Korey Neal.
Together, the father-son team has
turned K. Neal into the second largest
minority-owned truck and bus supplier
in the country, with more than $100
million in annual revenue and just
under 100 employees.
On the Senate Small Business Com-
mittee, we often speak of small busi-
nesses as drivers of economic growth
and innovation, but they are often also
pillars in their communities, and K.
Neal is no exception.
I had the privilege of meeting with
Stephen, Korey, and several K. Neal ex-
ecutives last month, and I was im-
pressed by the company’s commitment
to empowering all its employees and
investing in its community.
Half of the executives at K. Neal are
women, and for the past 5 years, the
company has partnered with the Prince
George’s County Economic Develop-
ment Corporation to train workers
from underserved communities to be-
come diesel technicians. I am proud to
share that 14 individuals have com-
pleted the program, and 8 of them are
currently employed by the company.

TRIBUTE TO TONY HARBAUGH
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
Sherriff Tony Harbaugh of Custer
County for his tremendous impact on
the State of Montana.
In early October, Sheriff Harbaugh
was awarded the Montana Board of
Crime Control Lifetime Achievement
Award at the 12th Annual Montana
Crime Prevention Conference in Bil-
lings.
Harbaugh began his career at the
Custer County Sheriff’s Office in 1978
as the only jailer. He was then offi-
cially sworn in as a deputy with the
sheriff’s office in May of 1979. Harbough
quickly climbed the ranks and was offi-
cially elected as Custer County
Sherriff in 1986, holding that title until
today.
Throughout his long career in law en-
forcement, Harbaugh has served in a
number of leadership positions in law
enforcement. Currently, Harbaugh is
the Montana law enforcement rep-
resentative on the Western States
Sheriff’s Board, chairman of the Peace
Officers Standards and Training Coun-
cil, chairman of the Eastern Montana
Drug Task Force, and is the National
Sheriffs liaison for Montana Sheriffs
and Peace Officers Association.
It is my honor to recognize Sherriff
Harbaugh for his extraordinary dedica-
tion to public service and public safety.
His role as leader in the law enforce-
ment community has made Montana a
better place to live, and I am grateful
for his selfless service to the Custer
community and Montanans statewide.∑

RECOGNIZING CRITICAL POWER
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home
State of Idaho. However, in honor of
Veterans Day on November 11, this
month I will honor a veteran-owned
small business for each of the 10 days
the Senate is in legislative session. The
personal sacrifices made by America’s
veterans have protected the very free-
doms and values that give each of us
and our children the ability to achieve
the American dream. The skills vet-
erans learn as members of the military
are invaluable and undoubtedly con-
tribute to Idaho’s flourishing veteran
business community. I am proud of the
sacrifices veterans have made to pro-
tect our country and that they are
choosing Idaho to call home when they
complete their service in the military.
As your United States Senator from
the great State of Idaho, it is my pleas-
ure to recognize Critical Power Prod-
ucts and Services in Post Falls as the
Veteran-owned Idaho Small Business of
the Day for November 14, 2019. Critical
Power is owned and operated by U.S.
Army veteran Will Alt. The company is
a proven leader in backup power and
cooling system recycling and redis-
tribution. The company serves cus-
tomers who want to dispose of and pur-
chase backup diesel and natural gas
generators, air-handling equipment,
uninterrupted power supply systems,
power distribution units, chillers, cool-
ing towers, and raised access floors.
The company provides its services to
small regional firms as well as inter-
national Fortune 500 companies across
all sectors.
Alt opened Critical Power Products
and Services in Post Falls in 2018. Alt
served in the U.S. Army for 5 years,
which included multiple overseas tours
attached to a multinational special op-
eration team. Critical Power attributes
much of its success to Alt’s time serv-
ing our Nation, stating ‘‘it ingrained
professionalism, discipline, and dedica-
tion into his work ethic that is second
to none.’’ The company employs sev-
eral veterans and even has a Fallen
Soldiers Memorial in front of their
18,000 square foot Post Falls facility.
Congratulations to Will Alt and all of
the employees at Critical Power Prod-
ucts and Services for being selected as
the Veteran-owned Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the Day for November 14, 2019.
You make our great State proud, and I
look forward to your continued growth
and success.∑

on behalf of the New Hampshire con-

HASSAN, Congresswoman ANN MCLANE
KUSTER, and Congressman CHRIS
PAPPAS—to pay tribute to Dr. William
‘‘Ed’’ Kois, a passionate and caring pro-

sure that each patient coming through
the hospital doors received the best
medical care possible. He was often de-
scribed, especially by the many vet-
erans he served, as the quintessential
‘‘patient’s doctor.’’
Dr. Kois began his work at the Man-
chester VAMC in 2012 after two-and-
half decades of private practice in
Nashua, NH. He specialized in
physiatry, a branch of medicine de-
voted to the treatment of medical con-
ditions affecting the brain, spinal cord,
nerves, and joints. His expertise made
him a natural fit for the Manchester
VAMC’s Spinal Cord Clinic, and he
began to treat many veterans whose
mobility and well-being were impacted
by spinal cord injury or dysfunction.
Dr. Kois sought to provide a standard
of care consistent with the core values
of the Veteran’s Administration—in-
tegrity, commitment, advocacy, re-
spect, and excellence—and his own
strong moral compass.
This fierce devotion to his principles
compelled Dr. Kois to lead a team of 11
whistleblowers alleging inadequate
care at the Manchester VAMC. Al-
though soft-spoken among friends and
colleagues, he became a powerful voice
and a public face in the effort to expose
substandard treatment and demand
better care for America’s veterans. The
advocacy of Dr. Kois and his colleagues
caught the attention of the Boston
Globe Spotlight investigative team,
which published a story in July 2017
that directed public attention to the
shortcomings at the Manchester
VAMC. It prompted a top-to-bottom re-
view that delivered needed changes and
improvements at the site.
As with any whistleblower com-
plaint, Dr. Kois undertook significant
risk in bringing these subjects to light.
Yet, with an uncompromising spirit
that many attribute to his amateur
boxer father, he was willing to sacrifice
his livelihood if it meant that veterans
would receive the care they need and
deserve. And he was eager to sit down
with hospital administration and work
with them to develop policies that ful-
fill that promise. His efforts benefited
countless men and women in the Gran-
ite State and across the country.
Dr. Kois is survived by his wife of 29
years, Pamela Greenley, as well as
many loving family members, treas-
ured colleagues, and cherished friends.
Ms. Greenley will be on hand next week
to accept the First Amendment Award
on her husband’s behalf from the
Nackey S. Loeb School of Communica-
tions. This distinction honors Granite
Staters who go above-and-beyond in
their use of the freedoms guaranteed
by the First Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution. We join the Loeb School,
as well as the Boston Globe Spotlight
team, in saluting the work and the life
of a deserving recipient, Dr. William
‘‘Ed’’ Kois.∑

NIZING NOVEMBER 15, 2019, AS
‘‘AMERICA RECYCLES DAY’’ AND
EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE
SENATE THAT RECYCLING PRO-
MOTES A HEALTHY ECONOMY
AND RESPONSIBLE ENVIRON-
MENTAL STEWARDSHIP
Mr. CARPER (for himself and Mr.
BOOZMAN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 422
Whereas recycling is among the top ac-
tions that people in the United States can do
to improve the environment and the econ-
omy of the United States;
Whereas, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency, in the United States,
only 21.4 percent of recyclable waste is recy-
cled;
Whereas, in the United States, recycling is
an industry valued at approximately
$200,000,000,000;
Whereas diverting 75 percent of waste in
the United States from landfilling and incin-
eration to recycling by 2030 would result in
the creation of approximately 2,300,000 recy-
cling jobs, nearly 2 times the number of re-
cycling jobs that existed in the United
States in 2008;
Whereas the 2016 Recycling Economic In-
formation Report by the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency found, using 2007 as a base
year, that recycling and reuse activities—
(1) accounted for approximately 757,000
jobs, 0.52 percent of all jobs in the United
States;
(2) produced approximately $36,600,000,000
in wages, 0.62 percent of total wages paid in
the United States; and
(3) produced approximately $6,700,000,000 in
tax revenue, 0.90 percent of total tax revenue
in the United States;
Whereas recycling conserves natural re-
sources and fresh water;
Whereas recycling prevents waste and dis-
carded materials from ending up in oceans
and waterways and harming water and wild-
life;
Whereas, in 2015, approximately 67,800,000
tons of municipal solid waste were recycled,
in contrast with 137,700,000 tons of municipal
solid waste that were landfilled; and
Whereas, with respect to the 67,800,000 tons
of municipal solid waste that were recycled,
paper and paperboard accounted for 67 per-
cent, metals accounted for 12 percent, and
glass, plastic, and wood accounted for be-
tween 4 and 5 percent: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes November 15, 2019, as ‘‘Amer-
ica Recycles Day’’;
(2) acknowledges that recycling benefits
and strengthens the economy, environment,
and communities of the United States; and
(3) encourages the people of the United
States to be cognizant of their environ-
mental footprint and to incorporate addi-
tional recycling practices into their daily
lives.

BOOKER, Mr. LANKFORD, Ms. HIRONO,
Ms. HASSAN, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr.
COONS, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. PETERS,
and Mr. REED) submitted the following
resolution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 423
Whereas, in the United States, public
schools identified approximately 1,300,000
homeless children and youth during the 2016–
2017 school year;
Whereas an estimated 1,200,000 children
younger than 6 years of age in 2014 and ap-
proximately 4,200,000 youth and young adults
in 2017 experienced homelessness, with many
such youth and young adults staying on
couches, in motels, in shelters, or outside;
Whereas infants who are homeless are at a
higher risk for developing certain illnesses
and health conditions, homeless families are
more likely to experience involvement in the
child welfare system, and homeless children
are more likely to experience difficulty with
school attendance;
Whereas a recent survey found that more
than 1 in 3 high school students experiencing
homelessness had attempted suicide, and
nearly 1 in 4 high school students experi-
encing homelessness had experienced dating
violence;
Whereas individuals without a high school
degree or general educational development
certificate (GED) are more than 3 times
more likely to report homelessness than
their peers, making lack of education the
leading risk factor for homelessness;
Whereas, in 2016, the high school gradua-
tion rate for homeless students was 64 per-
cent, compared to 77 percent for low-income
students and 84.6 percent for all students;
Whereas the rate of youth homelessness is
the same in rural, suburban, and urban
areas;
Whereas 29 percent of unaccompanied
homeless youth between 13 and 25 years of
age have spent time in foster care, compared
to approximately 6 percent of all children;
Whereas homelessness among children and
youth is a complex issue that often co-occurs
with deep poverty, low education and em-
ployment levels, substance misuse and
abuse, mental illness, lack of affordable
housing, and family conflict; and
Whereas awareness of child and youth
homelessness must be heightened to encour-
age greater support for effective programs to
help children and youth overcome homeless-
ness: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports the efforts of businesses, orga-
nizations, educators, and volunteers dedi-
cated to meeting the needs of homeless chil-
dren and youth;
(2) applauds the initiatives of businesses,
organizations, educators, and volunteers
that—
(A) use time and resources to raise aware-
ness of child and youth homelessness, the
causes of such homelessness, and potential
solutions; and
(B) work to prevent homelessness among
children and youth;
(3) recognizes November 2019 as ‘‘National
Homeless Children and Youth Awareness
Month’’; and
(4) encourages those businesses, organiza-
tions, educators, and volunteers to continue
to intensify their efforts to address home-
lessness among children and youth during
November 2019.

Whereas W.G. Jamison, the first president

NATING OCTOBER 2019 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL DOWN SYNDROME
AWARENESS MONTH’’ AND SUP-
PORTING THE GOALS AND
IDEALS OF NATIONAL DOWN
SYNDROME AWARENESS MONTH
Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. BEN-
NET, Mr. INHOFE, and Ms. WARREN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 425
Whereas 1 in every 691 babies born in the
United States has Down syndrome;
Whereas Down syndrome affects people of
all ages, races, and economic levels and is
the most frequently occurring chromosomal
abnormality;
Whereas the life expectancy of people with
Down syndrome has increased dramatically
in recent decades, from 25 years of age in 1983
to 60 years of age in 2019;
Whereas people with Down syndrome at-
tend school, work, participate in decisions
that affect them, have meaningful relation-
ships, can vote, and contribute to society in
many ways;
Whereas advancements in education, med-
ical care, and research and advocacy, and
positive support from family, friends, and
the community enable people with Down
syndrome to live healthy and fulfilling lives;
Whereas parents of babies and children
with Down syndrome should receive the edu-
cation and support they need to understand
the condition and acquire new hope for the
future of their children;
Whereas there are lifespan and health care
disparities for minorities, such as African
Americans with Down syndrome, that should
be understood and addressed;
Whereas people with Down syndrome have
a dramatically different health profile than
other individuals, as people with Down syn-
drome are predisposed to develop major dis-
eases (such as autoimmune disorders, leu-
kemia, and Alzheimer’s disease) and may be
protected from other major diseases (such as
solid tumor cancers, certain heart attacks,
and stroke);
Whereas advancing research and medical
care for people with Down syndrome can not
only increase life expectancy and improve
health outcomes for this unique population,
but also holds great promise for treating and
perhaps curing life-threatening diseases af-
fecting millions of other people in the United
States;
Whereas people with Down syndrome
should have access to health care providers
who have easy access to updated, evidence-
based medical care guidelines for children
and adults with the condition;
Whereas, on October 8, 2008, the Prenatally
and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions
Awareness Act (Public Law 110–374; 122 Stat.
4051) was enacted to increase referrals to pro-
viders of key support services for mothers
who have received a positive prenatal diag-
nosis for Down syndrome or a positive diag-
nosis for other prenatally or postnatally di-
agnosed conditions;
Whereas promoting the acceptance and in-
clusion of individuals born with Down syn-
drome, a genetic condition, will help those
individuals achieve their full potential in all
aspects of their lives;
Whereas, on September 28, 1984, President
Ronald Reagan signed a joint resolution
(Public Law 98–437; 98 Stat. 1683) proclaiming
October 1984 as ‘‘National Down’s Syndrome
Month’’, and similar resolutions were en-
acted annually through 1989; and
Whereas the inherent dignity and worth of
people with Down syndrome, the valuable
contributions of people with Down syndrome
as promoters of well-being and diversity
within their communities, and the impor-
tance of the individual freedom and inde-
pendence of people with Down syndrome
should be recognized: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates October 2019 as ‘‘National
Down Syndrome Awareness Month’’;
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Down Syndrome Awareness Month;
(3) celebrates the significant contributions
that people with Down syndrome make to
their families, their communities, and the
United States;
(4) is committed to promoting the health,
well-being, and inherent dignity of all chil-
dren and adults with Down syndrome;
(5) supports the advancement of scientific
and medical research on Down syndrome at
the National Institutes of Health, including
through the INCLUDE project, focused on
improving health outcomes for people with
the condition; and
(6) encourages awareness and education re-
garding Down syndrome, including for new
and expectant parents.

S. RES. 426
Whereas teachers play a critical role in
shaping the minds and lives of children;
Whereas there are projected to be 3,200,000
full-time public school teachers in 2020;
Whereas approximately 200,000 teachers
leave the profession each year;
Whereas in the 115th Congress, there were
more than 2 times as many Members of Con-
gress that had backgrounds in public service
or politics than Members of Congress that
had backgrounds in education; and
Whereas Members of Congress should be on
the ground in public schools to understand
the challenges that educators and students
face, including challenges relating to—
(1) a growing shortage of teachers;
(2) issues of teacher pay;
(3) a lack of resources in both urban and
rural areas;
(4) teacher preparedness;
(5) chronic absenteeism among students;
(6) poverty; and
(7) parental involvement: Now, therefore,
be it

(1) recognizes the contributions of teachers
to the United States;

gress spend at least 1 day per year serving as

most historically significant days of the year
for Sikhs, is celebrated every April;
Whereas Sikhism is the fifth largest reli-
gion in the world, and there are more than

Whereas Sikh men and women have nota-
bly contributed to the society of the United
States since their arrival in the United
States in the late 1800s;
Whereas Sikh Americans pursue diverse
professions that add to the social, cultural,

including by serving as members of the
Armed Forces and making significant con-
tributions in the fields of agriculture, infor-

tality, trucking, medicine, and technology;
Whereas Sikh Americans, such as Bhagat
Singh Thind, served in the Armed Forces

f
WHITE HORSE HILL NATIONAL
GAME PRESERVE DESIGNATION
ACT
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, Sullys
Hill is a national game preserve that is
located entirely within the Spirit Lake
Nation in North Dakota. I have a bill,
S. 2099, that I want to ask to be voted
on shortly. If enacted, my bill would
change the game preserve’s name from
‘‘Sullys Hill’’ to the English trans-
lation of its traditional Dakota name,
‘‘White Horse Hill.’’
The name change has the full support
of the Spirit Lake Nation and all of the
leadership of the local, State, and na-
tional government in North Dakota,
including the entire North Dakota con-
gressional delegation: my colleague,
Senator HOEVEN, chairman of the In-
dian Affairs Committee, and Congress-
man KELLY ARMSTRONG, who has an
identical bill introduced in the House.
In 1904, the game preserve was named
after GEN Alfred Sully. Unfortunately,
General Sully gained notoriety by com-
mitting several massacres of Native
Americans, most notably on September
3, 1863, in the Dakota Territory. As re-
prisal for the Dakota conflict of 1862,
his troops destroyed a village of over
500 teepees that lodged the Yankton,
Dakota, and Lakota people, killing
hundreds of Native Americans. Many of
the descendants of his victims live on
the very Tribal lands that surround
this hill.
With the issues that our Federal Gov-
ernment is dealing with today, chang-
ing the name of a game preserve in
North Dakota may seem like a small
matter, but let me assure you, Mr.
President and colleagues, this is no
small matter to the people of the Spirit
Lake Nation. I am sorry it has taken
us so long to correct this wrong. It has
taken us over 100 years to correct this
mistake.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of Calendar No.
223, S. 2099.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the bill by title.
The legislative clerk read as follows:
A bill (S. 2099) to redesignate the Sullys
Hill National Game Preserve in the State of
North Dakota as the White Horse Hill Na-
tional Game Preserve.
There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded to consider the bill, which
had been reported from the Committee
on Environment and Public Works.
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the bill be
considered read a third time and passed
and that the motion to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the
table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The bill (S. 2099) was ordered to be
engrossed for a third reading, was read

HONORING THE SERVICE OF
KRISTIN SHAPIRO
HON. ZOE LOFGREN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the service of Kristin A.
Shapiro, who is leaving the House to join the
Office of Legal Counsel at the United States
Department of Justice. Ms. Shapiro has
served in the Office of General Counsel for
nearly three years as an Assistant General
Counsel and has provided frequent and in-
valuable legal advice and representation to the
House community, particularly in connection
with federal court litigation involving issues of
great institutional importance.
Ms. Shapiro provided extensive advice and
litigation expertise to several Committees, in-
cluding the Committees on Armed Services,
Appropriations, and Budget, in connection with
the House’s litigation regarding the funding for
wall construction on the Southern border. In
addition, Ms. Shapiro provided litigation assist-
ance to both the Committee on Ways and
Means and the Joint Committee on Taxation
regarding the application of the Freedom of In-
formation Act to Congressional records. As the
Chairperson of the Committee on House Ad-
ministration, I know firsthand that our Mem-
bers and House staff also came to rely on Ms.
Shapiro’s expertise and guidance, particularly
in connection with how the use of social media
platforms by Members intersects with the First
Amendment.
Ms. Shapiro has played a very significant
role in safeguarding the legal and institutional
interests of the House of Representatives. She
has served the House with great distinction,
and we know she will continue to serve our
Nation with that same level of distinction at the
Department of Justice. I know that I speak for
all of my colleagues on the Committee on
House Administration, and the entire House
community, in thanking Ms. Shapiro for her
devoted service, and extend to her our very
best wishes for continued success.

RECOGNIZING HERBERT COGLEY
FOR THE 2019 MONTANA CON-
GRESSIONAL VETERAN COM-
MENDATION
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Herbert Cogley of Clancy
for the Montana Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for his service to his country and
community.
Mr. Cogley served with the U.S. Army in
Vietnam as a combat engineer with the 101st
Airborne Division. He received multiple com-
mendations during his time, including the
Bronze Star and Army Commendation Medal.
Following his return home, Mr. Cogley
helped build the VFW Hall in his hometown of
Jordan, Montana. He continues to be a part of
the VFW through volunteering and performing
with the Honor Guard at veteran funerals.
Over the years, he has also been involved in
Habitat for Humanity, coordinating the building
of several homes in Helena. In addition, Mr.
Cogley volunteers with the Montana Military
Museum at Fort Harrison and helps build dis-
plays.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in
commending Herbert Cogley for his service to
his country and community.

HONORING THE DENMARK FAMILY
AND RAISING AWARENESS OF
PHELAN–McDERMID SYNDROME
HON. MAX ROSE
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in
commending the Denmark family of Staten Is-
land for their hard work to raise awareness of
Phelan-McDermid syndrome. Back home in
New York, we recognized their efforts on Oc-
tober 22, which Governor Cuomo proclaimed
‘‘Phelan-McDermid Syndrome Awareness
Day’’ in the state, and now I ask my col-
leagues to join me in giving them the same
recognition here in the House.
Drew Denmark suffers from Phelan-
McDermid Syndrome, as well as Autism. In
many cases, including Drew’s, individuals
struggling with this disease are non-verbal and
are afflicted with cognitive disabilities. Phelan-
McDermid is often misdiagnosed as another
ailment, resulting in this syndrome being very
under-diagnosed.
After Drew’s diagnosis, the Denmark family
got to work ensuring that Phelan-McDermid
Syndrome received the recognition it de-
serves, in hopes that more families will now
be able to receive a proper diagnosis. I am
honored to have walked with Drew and his
family a few of weeks ago at the Autism
Speaks Staten Island Walk and am proud to
be on Team Drew each and every day.
As more and more patients struggling with
this disease receive accurate diagnoses of
Phelan-McDermid Syndrome and families are
able get their loved ones the care they need,
they will in no small part have the Denmark
family to thank for it.
This family embodies what it means to be
Staten Islanders and New Yorkers: when we
want change to happen, we go out and fight
for it. So, Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues in the House to join me in honoring
Drew and the rest of the Denmark family for
the courage, and tenacity they have displayed.
INTRODUCTION OF THE TOTAL
RECALL ACT OF 2019
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
announce the introduction of the Total Recall
Act of 2019, which would require businesses
to strengthen and streamline notifications for
product recalls to consumers.
Every year, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC) recalls at least 400 prod-
ucts, but due to poor notification practices by
manufacturers and producers, the average re-
sponse rate of consumers for most recalls is
only between 4 and 18 percent. Consumers
are purchasing or failing to stop using prod-
ucts because they are unaware of recall notifi-
cations.
As a mom myself, I know that parents can-
not be expected to check the CPSC website
every time they purchase a product for their
families. If a company sells a dangerous item,
that company should be expected to market
the recall as aggressively as they marketed
the sale of the product.
That is why I am introducing the Total Re-
call Act, legislation which will implement much
needed reforms to increase the effectiveness
of products recalled by the CPSC. This bill will
increase requirements for companies to post
recall notices on their websites and social
media, and require or encourage companies
to use parts of the original marketing budgets
of the product in question on notifying con-
sumers of the recall.
The numbers don’t lie; if consumers are not
participating in recalls, then companies need
to work harder to let their consumers know
about any dangers that they face from contin-
ued use of these products. Companies know
how to market products, it is time for them to
apply those same skills to marketing recalls.

Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud NCAA football
on the 150th anniversary of their first colle-
giate game.
On November 6, 1869, Rutgers College
(now Rutgers University) went on to defeat the
College of New Jersey (now Princeton Univer-
sity) by a score of 6–4. Football was nothing
like today’s game. It used a rugby-type ball on
a 110-yard field. A touchdown was worth four
points and the games had two 45-minute
halves with a running clock.
The University of Colorado Buffaloes are
rich in football history. The CU Buffs began

HONORING VIVECA LOHR
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Viveca Lohr for her 33 years of
service to Meals on Wheels of the Monterey
Peninsula, including 32 years as Executive Di-
rector. The 20th Congressional District of Cali-
fornia appreciates Viveca Lohr’s dedication to
her community on the central coast of Cali-
fornia and the great efforts she has made to
serve seniors and disabled adults on the Mon-
terey Peninsula.
Viveca Lohr began her work with Meals on
Wheels of the Monterey Peninsula in Novem-
ber of 1986 and quickly became a leader in
the organization, rising to Assistant Executive
Director in May of 1987 and Executive Direc-
tor in November of 1987. Ms. Lohr now over-
sees the day-to-day operations of this critically
important organization that strives to promote
the well-being and independence of clients on
the Monterey Peninsula by providing home-de-
livered meals, welfare checks, and group
meals. During her 32 years as Executive Di-
rector, Ms. Lohr has overseen the Meals on
Wheels Home Delivered Meals Program as it
has grown to deliver over 190,000 meals an-
nually to more than 500 homebound clients
who cannot shop or cook for themselves.
Viveca Lohr has worked with a tireless team
of staff, Board Members, and volunteers who
make this critical service possible. Through
generous donations and fundraising events in
the community on the Central Coast, pro-
grams can be administered to guarantee the
continued health and well-being of individuals
who may not otherwise be able to remain
independent without Meals on Wheels. The
program not only serves food and conversa-
tion to its clients, but also provides more than
20,000 hours of exercise, health, and enrich-
ment classes at its headquarters, the Sally
Griffin Learning Center, to promote and main-
tain healthy aging. This facility is named after
the Meals on Wheels program’s dedicated
founder, Sally Judd Griffin.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in congratulating and thanking Viveca
Lohr for her 33 years of service and leader-
ship on the central coast of California. Her
tireless commitment to improving the lives of
seniors and disabled adults in California’s 20th
Congressional District will not be forgotten,
and her legacy in the community will certainly
be long lasting. On behalf of Central Coast
residents, I thank Ms. Lohr for her contribution
to our community and wish her a long and
healthy retirement.
HONORING THE MEMORY OF
GORDON SCOTT BRACE
HON. ZOE LOFGREN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life of Gordon Scott
Brace and his service to the House.
Many dedicated public servants work behind
the scenes to support the vital work of this
body and our work as Members. That is true
for what may be the most significant charge
we have: casting our vote here on the floor on
behalf of our constituents.
Mr. Brace helped make that possible. Dur-
ing his 17 years with the Office of the Clerk as
a senior systems engineer, Mr. Brace was pri-
marily responsible for maintaining all aspects
of the Electronic Voting System (EVS). When-
ever the House was in session, Mr. Brace
made certain that the EVS was in full working
order, manually checking all 54 voting sta-
tions, the tally clerk station, electronic display
board, and the EVS equipment in the cloak-
rooms.
To put this in perspective, during Mr.
Brace’s tenure the House completed more
than 12,300 roll call votes. Considering the in-
dividual vote of each Member of the House on
each of those roll call votes, Mr. Brace played
a central role on a team with the responsibility
to track more than 5,350,500 individual votes.
Every single one of those votes had to be
tracked swiftly, accurately, and without doubt.
Moreover, every one of those votes represents
a small, but important, part of our nation’s his-
tory.
Mr. Brace is remembered fondly by his co-
workers and friends here in the House not just
for his technical skills, but for his kindness and
generosity. I know I speak on behalf of his co-
workers and my colleagues in honoring his
memory and his important contributions to the
operations of the House. Our thoughts are
with his wife, Kristin, sons Wyatt and Dillon,
and all of his loved ones.

RECOGNIZING ROLAND HEATON
FOR THE 2019 MONTANA CON-
GRESSIONAL VETERAN COM-
MENDATION
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Roland Heaton of Town-
send for the Montana Congressional Veteran
Commendation for his service to his country
and dedication to the community.
Mr. Heaton served in the U.S. Army as a
maintenance technician in Vietnam and Japan.
He received multiple commendations for his
service, including the Good Conduct Medal
and the Vietnam Campaign award.
Mr. Heaton’s heart to serve lead him to cre-
ate a project that generates funding to assist
the community’s first responders with the pur-
chase of non-budget equipment. This allows
them to better serve the community. Since it
was created, it has raised over $15,000 to
purchase the needed equipment. Additionally,
Mr. Heaton serves on the board of the county
food bank and volunteers there regularly.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in
commending Roland Heaton for his service
and dedication.

RECOGNIZING TREE CITY USA
DESIGNATIONS
HON. VAN TAYLOR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise
to recognize eight cities in Texas’ Third Con-
gressional District who have received this
year’s Tree City USA designation by the Arbor
Day Foundation.
Allen, Fairview, Frisco, McKinney, Murphy,
Plano, Prosper, and Wylie—all located within
Collin County—have proven they care about
ensuring the environment around them is thriv-
ing and full of life.
These Collin County cities understand that
trees serve an integral purpose in our commu-
nity, including improved health, clean air and
water, and a positive impact on businesses
and homes in the area. Not only are these
communities dedicated to providing necessary
municipal tree care, but they are encouraging
their residents to do the same. I commend
these cities for their investments in green in-
frastructure and for creating a lasting and
positive impact for generations to come.
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentative to join me in congratulating these
eight communities on their efforts to maintain
healthy and green environments in their neigh-
borhoods.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1441
November 14, 2019
Currently, our industry supports hundreds
of thousands of jobs, tens of millions in tax
revenue, and billions in economic activity.
In 2017, the five states that had taxed and
regulated adult-use sales (Alaska, Colorado,
Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) collected
more than $790 million in state tax revenue
that year. However, per current federal law,
cannabis remains a Schedule 1 drug under
the Controlled Substances Act. This blocks
state-licensed cannabis business and firms
providing ancillary products or services to
the industry from accessing banking serv-
ices, forcing them to operate in an all-cash
environment. This situation not only creates
an unnecessary public safety risk, it poses an
undue burden on state and local tax and li-
censing authorities, which are forced to take
large cash payments. These taxes and licens-
ing fees fund the enforcement of state mari-
juana laws as well as school construction,
drug education activities, and infrastructure
programs.
In order to operate safely and successfully,
businesses must have access to traditional fi-
nancial services. For the cannabis industry,
which conducts hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in transactions across the majority of
U.S. states, the lack of access to financial
services creates public safety hazards, in-
cluding an increased chance of becoming a
target for robberies, loss of economic oppor-
tunity, and inability to retain workforce tal-
ent. Restricting financial services to li-
censed cannabis businesses also prevents the
elimination of illicit businesses currently
operating in the grey and black markets.
The SAFE Banking Act of 2019 would offer
not only safe harbor for financial institu-
tions that choose to service cannabis related
businesses, but would also provide much
needed clarity and direction from the federal
government.
After nearly a decade of significant regu-
latory changes at the state level, now is the
time to pass the SAFE Banking Act of 2019.
Ending the conflict between state and fed-
eral cannabis laws will promote a sound and
robust financial system that best supports
the economic growth and job creation driven
by the growing number of state-licensed can-
nabis businesses across the country.
Sincerely,
AARON SMITH,
Executive Director & Founder.
NATIONAL CANNABIS ROUNDTABLE,
September 25, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: The National Cannabis
Roundtable (NCR) is proud to offer its strong
support for H.R. 1595, the Secure and Fair
Enforcement Banking Act of 2019 (SAFE).
The passage of SAFE represents a clear,
common sense solution to one of the biggest
challenges for one of the fastest growing in-
dustries in America.
The National Cannabis Roundtable rep-
resents every aspect of the cannabis supply
chain. Our fifteen members operate in 23
states with legal cannabis programs, includ-
ing the District of Columbia. We are growers,
processors, retailers, wellness centers, tech-
nology companies, investors, entrepreneurs,
and publicly traded companies.
Since California passed Proposition 215 in
1996 which legalized the use of medical can-
nabis by those with debilitating conditions,
states around the country have developed
cannabis programs by licensing and regu-
lating cannabis businesses. Unfortunately,
due to the Schedule I status of cannabis,
these businesses have been unable to access
traditional financial services, causing mas-
sive public safety problems and business op-
erations challenges.
The SAFE Act deftly rectifies this problem
by allowing legitimate, licensed cannabis
businesses to access financial services. It
provides clarity for financial regulators and
opportunity to entrepreneurs by creating a
system of accessible capital. SAFE also
would allow for increased financial trans-
parency in the cannabis industry allowing
law enforcement to sort out licensed busi-
ness from illicit actors.
The bill’s lead sponsors Ed Perlmutter (D–
CO), Denny Heck (D–WA), Steve Stivers (R–
OH) and Warren Davidson (R–OH) have devel-
oped broad bipartisan support for this impor-
tant legislation. The SAFE Act is supported
by a sweeping coalition of stakeholders. Ac-
tivists in the drug policy community, busi-
nesses in the cannabis industry, investors,
state and local law enforcement, banking
regulators, and many other groups.
Currently, 47 states, the District of Colum-
bia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands, the Northern Mariana Islands and sev-
eral Indian tribes have some form of legal-
ized cannabis either through an adult use
program, a medical cannabis program, or
through cannabidiol programs. Additionally,
seven states are expected to either create or
expand cannabis programs via ballot initia-
tives in 2020 and 2021. It is estimated that
legal cannabis industry U.S. consumer
spending on legal cannabis reached $10.4 bil-
lion dollars in 2018. Even if no other states
reform their laws, cannabis spending is ex-
pected to top $26 billion by 2025. The SAFE
Act ensures that this economic growth can
happen in legitimate channels instead of on
the streets.
While there are many more facets of can-
nabis reform that must be tackled in the fu-
ture, the SAFE Banking Act will provide
needed clarity. keep our communities safe,
and foster economic growth and opportunity.
Sincerely,
SAPHIRA GALOOB,
Executive Director,
National Cannabis Roundtable.

Re: CTF Supports the ‘‘Secure And Fair En-
forcement Banking Act of 2019’’ or the
‘‘SAFE Banking Act of 2019’’
Hon. MAXINE WATERS,
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY,
Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Serv-
ices, House of Representatives, Washington,
DC.
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS AND RANKING
MEMBER MCHENRY: The Cannabis Trade Fed-
eration (CTF), a national coalition of can-
nabis-related businesses that represent all
aspects of the industry including cultivators,
dispensaries, wholesalers, distributors, and
ancillary businesses, strongly supports en-
actment of the SAFE Banking Act, legisla-
tion that would create a federal safe harbor
for banks that offer direct or indirect serv-
ices to cannabis-related businesses pursuant
to state law. The SAFE Banking Act will
benefit law enforcement, state regulatory
bodies, including taxing authorities, and
cannabis-related businesses.
We associate ourselves with the testimony
provided to the Subcommittee on Consumer
Protection and Financial Institutions on
February 13, 2019, by Rachel Pross, Chief
Risk Officer for Maps Credit Union, who tes-
tified on behalf of the Credit Union National
Association. She correctly observed:
In the absence of a federal law providing
explicit legal clearance for financial institu-
tions to provide banking services to the Can-
nabis industry, it is highly likely that many
of these businesses will be forced to continue
operating outside of the financial main-
stream. That outcome increases the poten-
tial of lost tax revenue, increases the likeli-
hood of criminal thefts in our communities,
and deprives both state and federal law en-
forcement with important information about
cannabis activity.
She is correct and her observations are ob-
viously true. We would like to underscore
the importance of having cannabis-related
businesses mainstreamed into the financial
system to law enforcement. In short, cash-
only businesses are more susceptible to bad
actors, including money laundering, than are
those in the banking system where all anti-
money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act
rules are followed and enforced. This is one
reason FinCEN promulgated guidance on
February 14, 2014, regarding ‘‘BSA Expecta-
tions Regarding Marijuana-Related Busi-
nesses,’’ which remains in effect today. That
guidance noted that it ‘‘should enhance the
availability of financial services for, and the
financial transparency of, marijuana-related
businesses.’’
As important as that guidance is, banks
have not fully embraced it. Only federal leg-
islation can achieve the type of transparency
and regulatory compliance sought by
FinCEN. For these reasons, we urge the
Committee to order the SAFE Banking Act
of 2019 favorably reported so that the full
House of Representatives can consider this
important legislation forthwith.
Sincerely,
NEAL LEVINE,
Chief Executive Officer,
Cannabis Trade Federation.

Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: The California Cannabis In-
dustry Association (CCIA) would like to offer
its enthusiastic support for H.R. 1595, the Se-
cure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act of
2019 (SAFE). From the passage of our state’s
medical cannabis program with Proposition
215 in 1996, to the passage of adult use can-
nabis with Proposition 64 in 2016, California
has been the leading ‘‘laboratory for democ-
racy’’ on cannabis policy. The SAFE Bank-
ing Act is a massive victory for California
cannabis business and consumers.
CCIA is the collective voice of the state’s
cannabis industry, representing the diverse
interests of cannabis retailers, cultivators,
manufacturers, delivery services, distribu-
tors, testing facilities, insurance groups,
packaging companies, and various ancillary
services. Our unified voice includes over 500
California businesses representing over 670
brands and approximately 15,000 employees.
Without question, the biggest challenge
that all our members face is access to tradi-
tional financial services. Due to restrictions
in Federal law, CCIA member businesses are
forced to primarily operate through cash
transactions, creating a massive public safe-
ty problem, and a logistical nightmare when
it comes to things like processing employee
payroll and paying state and local taxes. In
fact, some members of CCIA have paid up-
wards of $500,000 in cash carried in duffel
bags for quarterly tax payments. It is esti-
mated that legal cannabis sales will hit $3.1
billion in 2019 and $7.2 billion by 2024, a mar-
ket that will be 40% larger than all of Can-
ada and 253% larger than Colorado. SAFE

moves these massive revenues into legiti-
mate banks and off the streets. With access
to banking services our businesses can rein-
vest in communities, increase of trans-
parency of our operations, and help facilitate
economic growth. Additionally, SAFE pre-
vents consumers from having to carry cash
to pay for their cannabis and allows them to
purchase with credit cards. SAFE provides
clarity for financial regulators and law en-
forcement to sort out licensed business from
illicit actors.

cannabis programs to become fully on par
with other existing industries.

FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE AND CONSUMER SERVICES,
February 13, 2019.
House Committee on Financial Services,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN MAXINE WATERS AND
RANKING MEMBER MCHENRY: On behalf of
Florida’s farmers, our medical marijuana
professionals, and consumers, I want to
thank you for your efforts to provide the
cannabis industry access to traditional
banking and express my strong support for
the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking
Act (H.R. 2215).
Conflicting guidance from the federal gov-
ernment has unnecessarily, led to a higher
level of risk and hurdles for businesses in
this emerging market. This is an issue that
affected me personally—while running for
this office, our campaign had two bank ac-
counts closed due to my advocacy for med-
ical marijuana access and cannabis. The ab-
sence of traditional banking services forces
state-licensed businesses to resort to all cash
operations, which is inefficient and a public
safety concern. Businesses can’t operate pro-
ficiently with irregularities restricting their
growth, stability, and the ability to pay
bills, rent, and employees, when their ac-
counts are inevitably closed. This is an issue
impacting our state and national economy.
One of the important provisions of the re-
cently signed 2018 Farm Bill (the Agriculture
Improvement Act of 2018) is the relisting of
hemp as an agricultural commodity. But
without congressional action, continued con-
fusion and misinformation regarding hemp
could discourage financial institutions from
partnering with our farmers on this new
commodity.
The Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking
Act (H.R. 2215) is a strong first step in pro-
viding legitimate cannabis related and state-
licensed farmers, business, and consumers
with access to an efficient and safe banking
system, and traditional loans and capital
markets.
Sincerely,
NICOLE FRIED,
Commissioner of Agriculture.
NATIONAL ARMORED CAR ASSOCIATION,
September 25, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House, Senate Committee on
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, Senate Committee on Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs, Washington,
DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the National Ar-
mored Car Association (NACA), I write to ex-
press our support for H.R. 1595, the Secure
and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act
of 2019. While NACA’s members do not take
a position in favor of or opposed to the legal-
ization of cannabis or marijuana, nor cur-
rently service the U.S. cannabis industry, we
support H.R. 1595 because it would address
the existing conflict between federal and
state law with respect to proceeds from
marijuana-related businesses and allow for
safer transportation, storage and oversite of
such proceeds.
Formed in 1929, NACA is a business asso-
ciation that brings together the three major
companies of the armored car industry—
Brink’s, Garda, and Loomis—with a focus on
protecting and promoting the common inter-
ests of the industry. These three organiza-
tions comprise approximately 90% of the ar-
mored car industry in the United States, and
NACA members have handled virtually every
dollar and coin in circulation. They provide
secure transportation and cash management
services for the Federal Reserve, financial
institutions, state and local governments,
and private businesses and individuals across
the United States and internationally.
Currently thirty-three states and several
territories, including the District of Colum-
bia, Guam, and Puerto Rico, have legalized
the use of cannabis to some extent. However,
federal law prohibits cultivation, distribu-
tion, and possession of marijuana imposing
significant legal risks to financial institu-
tions and ancillary businesses that might
consider providing financial services to the
marijuana industry. Consequently, hundreds
of millions of dollars in cash are being trans-
ported and stored outside our banking sys-
tem and often without adequate security and
oversight. The lack of available vendors to
provide secure transport and storage of cash
increases the risk of criminal activity that
can pose a danger not only to those involved
in the cannabis industry, but the general
public. H.R. 1595 would provide NACA mem-
ber companies with the needed legal protec-
tion and clarity to safely and securely trans-
port cash in states that have legalized and
regulated cannabis.
We urge members of the House to support
H.R. 1595.
Sincerely,
BASIL THOMSON,
Senior Director, NACA.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL
EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the Federal Employee Recruitment
Act of 2019 to require the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) to develop, within three
months of enactment of this bill, a plan for re-
cruiting new workers into federal service. With
the aging of the federal workforce, this bill is
more important than ever.
The average age of federal employees has
steadily increased over the course of the last
two decades, hitting 47.5 years in 2017. In the
private sector, 54 percent workers are over 40
years old, while in the federal workforce, that
number is 69 percent. At the end of last year,
only 6 percent of the federal workforce were
under 30, while almost a quarter of private-
sector employees were under 30.
There are numerous consequences to an
aging federal workforce. For example, as older
federal employees opt to retire, the govern-
ment risks permanently losing much of its in-
stitutional knowledge if federal agencies can-
not find adequate replacements.
Possible solutions to the problem of a
graying workforce include increased federal
recruitment at college and university cam-
puses, increased technological innovation in
how applications are submitted, and a greater
number of internships. Improved benefits, in-
cluding paid family leave, increased telework,

RECOGNIZING ALICE SEFCIK
SULAK
HON. JOHN R. CARTER
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I’m honored to recognize the incredible life
and achievements of Alice Sefcik Sulak of
Temple, Texas. Her contributions to the re-
gion, as well as her commitment to maintain-
ing the proud traditions of her Czech ancestry,
have made her a beloved member of the Cen-
tral Texas community.
Renowned for both her singing voice as well
as her abilities to play multiple instruments,
Alice was one of Texas’ pioneering Czech vo-
calists who distinguished herself as an accom-
plished and respected musician with a distinc-
tive and recognizable style. Throughout her
life, she both mentored young musicians and
helped popularize Czech music throughout
Texas.
Alice remains a vital member of the Temple
community. In 1923, her parents built Tom
Sefcik Hall, a classic Texas dance hall. Alice
grew up working at the hall, and in 1970 she
took over the operation, which she continues
to run today. Sefcik Hall is a community gath-
ering place and the site of countless first
dates, weddings, anniversary celebrations,
birthday parties, and family reunions. While
the number of dance halls across Texas are
dwindling, the lights remain on at Sefcik Hall,
where new memories are made every day.
Recognizing her invaluable contributions,
the City of Temple has proclaimed November
17, 2019 as ‘‘Alice Sefcik Sulak Day.’’ She is
truly a local treasure and a fitting recipient of
our recognition and appreciation. Her commit-
ment to investing her gifts, talents, and abili-
ties to improve her community is a deeply held
creed that speaks to the generosity of a true
and devoted citizen.
Alice Sefcik Sulak’s life is the story of a
woman unafraid to chase her passions and
devote her time to make good communities
great. I join all Temple residents in celebrating
her on this special day.

GRAVE CONCERN FOR THE WEL-
FARE OF JOSE DANIEL FERRER
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I am
gravely concerned for the welfare of Jose
Daniel Ferrer, a courageous Cuban pro-de-
mocracy activist and hero of the Patriotic
Union of Cuba (UNPACU).
Ferrer was seized on October 1, 2019, and
remains held without access to family, friends,
legal counsel, international human rights
groups, or other concerned members of his or-
ganization.
Human rights groups including Amnesty
International have cited alarming but unverified
reports of torture and maltreatment at the
hands of the regime’s thugs, including the
withholding of necessary medical care, food
and water.
It is a disgrace that the King and Queen of
Spain are in Cuba, while Ferrer languishes in
prison, and have failed to exercise simple
human decency by demanding his release, or
meeting with other courageous independent
democracy and human rights activists.
The regime in Cuba has the blood of inno-
cents on its hands, those whose only ‘‘crime’’
was daring to speak against the evils of the
dictatorship including:
Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who died in state
custody on February 23, 2010; Juan Wilfredo
Soto Garcia, who died on May 8, 2011;
Laura Pollan, the renowned leader of the
Ladies in White, who died under suspicious
circumstances on October 14, 2011;
Wilman Willar Mendoza, who died on Janu-
ary 19, 2012;
Armando Sosa Fortuny, who died on Octo-
ber 28, 2019;
We also remember Oswaldo Paya and Har-
old Cepero of the Christian Liberation Move-
ment, both of whom died on July 22, 2012 in
a suspicious car accident that has not been
fully and appropriately investigated.
The regime of firing squads, political pris-
oners, the Tugboat Massacre, the Brothers to
the Rescue shootdown, the Black Spring, and
the murders of activists continues its evils to
this day. It continues to intimidate, detain, en-
courage acts of repudiation, and inflict brutal
violence to suppress the Cuban people.
Jose Daniel Ferrer must be released imme-
diately and without condition, and those who
participate in vile human rights abuses must
be held accountable. The world is watching.
Should any harm come to Ferrer, the mur-
derous Cuban dictatorship headed by Raúl
Castro and his puppet Miguel Diaz-Canel bear
sole responsibility.

FOR THE 2019 MONTANA CON-
GRESSIONAL VETERAN COM-

HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Mary LaForge of Crow
Agency for the Montana Congressional Vet-
eran Commendation for her service to her
country and service to fellow veterans at Crow
Agency.
Ms. LaForge served in the United States Air
Force as a reprographic specialist. She re-
ceived multiple commendation during her time
in the Air Force, including the Air Force Over-
seas Service Ribbon and the Good Conduct
Medal.
At the Crow Agency, Ms. LaForge has
played a large role in providing many services
to her fellow veterans. She coordinated with
the Billings Vet Center to ensure mental health
services are provided to Crow Agency vet-
erans, assisted others with enrolling in pro-
grams with the Department of Veteran Affairs,
and brought veteran employment fairs and job
opportunities to the agency. Additionally, she
placed a key role in organizing the Yellow-
stone Homeless Veterans Stand Down.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in
commending Mary LaForge for her dedication
and service to her country and community.

CALLING FOR THE RELEASE OF
AUSTIN TICE
SPEECH OF
HON. DEREK KILMER
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 12, 2019
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, more than seven
years ago, Austin Tice, an American journalist
and Marine Corps veteran, disappeared in
Syria.
Since the day he vanished, his parents,
family, friends, and supporters, have worked
tirelessly to ensure that no stone is left
unturned and no avenue ignored to see Austin
return home safely.
In the seventh year of Austin’s captivity, l
ask that whomever holds Austin release him
immediately so that he can return to his loved
ones.
I also ask the assistance of the Government
of Syria do whatever it can to help facilitate
Austin’s release.
There are things that transcend politics and
diplomacy, bridge cultural divides, and need
no translation across different languages.
Those are things like love and hope—rep-
resented by a mother and father who wake up
each day with deep love and concern for their
son and the belief that today could be the day
when they get the chance to hug him again.
I ask for the help of whomever holds Austin
and can assist with his release—without the
assignment of blame or malice to anyone—so
that this year is the last that Austin remains so
far from home and his family.

The experience and commitment of U.S. At-
torney Rodrı́guez-Vélez has been vital in the
Puerto Rico District. Her record in this office is
of outstanding performance in the face of the
great challenges in the fight against violent
crime, drug and arms trafficking, national se-
curity threats, human trafficking, organized
crime, illegal entry into the U.S., and most no-
tably the fight against public corruption.
U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodrı́guez-Vélez
has served the public interest since 1977 in
the Puerto Rico Department of Justice and
since 1988 in the U.S. Attorney’s Office. In
that role she held numerous key positions in

Ms. Rodrı́guez-Vélez was appointed U.S.

and received a presidential nomination in Jan-

pointed Ms. Rodrı́guez-Vélez to serve as
United States Attorney for the District of Puer-
to Rico. On October 4, 2011, Ms. Rodrı́guez-
Vélez was re-appointed to a new term as
United States Attorney, pursuant to the unani-

trafficking and violent crime in Puerto Rico, in-
cluding multiple drug strike forces responsible
for over 2,400 arrests; an Illegal Firearms and
Violence Reduction Initiative, responsible for
over 500 arrests; and a RICO Unit to pros-
ecute violent drug trafficking organizations.
She has received numerous awards and com-
mendation letters during her years of service
from both the Puerto Rico and United States
Departments of Justice, as well as from state

Her character has been tested many times,
often facing unfair political attacks and ob-

professional excellence and her heartfelt belief
in justice and American values, I congratulate
her on a well and faithfully executed career—
42 years working in both the Puerto Rico and
U.S. Departments of Justice, 12 of them as

I personally admire the courage of Attorney

HONORING THE KICK FOR NICK
FOUNDATION
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, just a few
weeks ago I had the extraordinary opportunity
to participate in a local fundraiser for the Kick
For Nick Foundation and was so inspired by
the generosity of the participants and the mis-
sion of the Foundation that I wanted to share
the experience with my colleagues.
PFC Nicholas A. Madaras of Wilton, Con-
necticut served our country bravely in Iraq
until his life was cut tragically short by an IED
on September 3, 2006. He was just 19 years
old and weeks away from the scheduled end
of his deployment. Nick had been an avid soc-
cer player, coach, and referee growing up and
when he had last came home on leave he had
shared stories about connecting with young
Iraqi children through the sport, often using
anything they could find as a ball, most times
nothing more than a tin can. Nick asked
friends and family to send him a few soccer
balls to share with the children in Baqubah.
Unfortunately, he never got that chance.
Yet, from their grief, Nick’s family and
friends found a new mission—a way to pay
tribute to Nick’s memory, his passion for soc-
cer, and his desire to make a difference in the
lives of the children he had met in the war-tom
country where he served. Shortly after his
passing, Nick’s family was approached by Ken
Dartley, also of Wilton, who had read Nick’s
story and asked to start a program collecting
soccer balls in his honor to fulfill his wish to
share his love and passion for the game with
Iraqi children. It was through this first effort
that the Kick For Nick Foundation was born.
What began with a few soccer balls in a net
donated at the James P. Whipple American
Legion Post 86 in Wilton has since grown ex-
ponentially with over 50,000 soccer balls hav-
ing been donated and distributed to date. The
Kick For Nick Foundation has received dona-
tions from 47 of the 50 states and, prior to dis-
tribution, each one is inscribed three times
with Nick’s name. Initially the balls were dis-
tributed only by US troops in Iraq, but over the
years, in addition to soldiers, the distribution
network has grown to include US military con-
tractors, volunteers, individuals, schools, and
charitable organizations. Balls have been
given to underprivileged children in more than
50 countries including Afghanistan, Syria, Leb-
anon, Bhutan, Guatemala, Colombia. Beyond,
the distribution of soccer balls, when they
have the opportunity and the supplies, Kick
For Nick has also provided uniforms, cleats,
shin guards, personal hygiene supplies such
as toothbrushes and toothpaste, school sup-
plies such as pencils, notebooks and
backpacks, as well as occasional food sup-
plies.
As I walked through the fundraiser and the
many who had gathered to support the Foun-
dation, I was inspired by the displays showing
pictures of troops distributing the balls and of
notes of thanks from the soldiers distributing
them as well as the young people receiving
them. I had the opportunity to speak with
Nick’s father, Bill, as well as several of his
family members, finding myself in awe of their
strength and determination to ensure Nick’s
memory continues to make a difference in the
world. The Kick For Nick Foundation is an ex-
traordinary effort and a wonderful tribute to
PFC Madaras. It is my hope that their success
continues to grow and that they can continue
in their mission to foster peace, good will and
stability across the globe by collecting soccer
balls and delivering them into the hands of un-
derprivileged children around the world—hon-
oring the memory of PFC Nicholas A.
Madaras and giving life to his dream of bring-
ing a bit of hope and joy to children living in
difficult circumstances.

Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize the dutiful work of
my constituent, Police Chief Dave Spiller, on
the occasion his retirement from the
Pleasanton Police Department after 17 years
of service.
Chief Spiller joined the Pleasanton Police
Department in 2002 after more than a decade
serving the San Diego and Mountain View Po-
lice Departments. In 2011, Chief Spiller was
appointed to be Pleasanton’s sixth police
chief. He has served in every sworn rank of
the police profession—from officer to chief.
Chief Spiller’s colleagues can attest not only
to his professionalism but to his commitment
to safety and quality of life in Pleasanton. His
leadership as police chief was characterized
by compassion, integrity and responsiveness
to the city.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1445
November 14, 2019
Chief Spiller’s commitment to law enforce-
ment has left an immeasurable impact that ex-
tends far beyond his own department. In his
time as chief he has modernized the depart-
ment’s training, technology, and equipment.
He has fostered lasting partnerships that have
shaped the future of his community and local
law enforcement.
Chief Spiller’s passion for public service is
reflected by his pursuit of higher education
which culminated in his master’s degree in
public leadership from St. Mary’s College.
Through his service as an advisory board
member on the Administration of Justice
Board and an adjunct faculty member at Las
Positas College, Chief Spiller is cultivating a
future police force that will reflect the same in-
tegrity and commitment that he has brought to
the law enforcement community.
In addition, Chief Spiller serves as a mem-
ber of the International Criminal Justice Board
at the University of San Francisco, a member
of the Board of Directors for the California Po-
lice Chiefs Association, and he is an inde-
pendent contract trainer and group facilitator
serving non-profit organizations and municipal
governments.
I want to thank Chief Spiller for the contribu-
tions he has made to the Pleasanton Police
department and community. Your extraor-
dinary vision and leadership will be missed,
and we wish you a fulfilling retirement.

HONORING MS. MARY E. STUART
HON. VAN TAYLOR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise
to recognize an outstanding individual who
has been volunteering for sixty consecutive
years. At the age of 91, Ms. Mary Stuart can
be found working seven hour shifts at Medical
City Plano five days a week.
In 1959, Ms. Stuart began her hospital vol-
unteer efforts in Newfane, New York, and later
relocated to Tallahassee, Florida where she
continued her work in area medical centers. In
1997, Mary moved to Plano and soon became
a valued volunteer at Medical City Plano. In
fact, just this year Ms. Stuart received her
25,500 hours volunteer pin which is the most
hours a volunteer has ever given to Medical
City Plano since they opened their doors in
1975.
Her unbelievable track record as a commu-
nity servant who puts the needs of others
above her own has earned her other pres-
tigious titles such as the Texas Yellow Rose
from former Texas Governor Rick Perry and
Honorary Georgia Peach.
The Plano community is very proud of her
leadership in volunteerism. Ms. Stuart exem-
plifies a passion for helping others and she
undoubtedly betters the world around her.
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in thanking Ms. Mary
Stuart for her sixty years of volunteer work.
RECOGNIZING LYNNE AND MYRON
MALNAA OF GLASGOW
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Lynne and Myron Malnaa of
Glasgow for their dedication to and compas-
sion for Montana’s children.
After her eldest daughter graduated from
high school and with their son and Myron
rodeoing, Lynne felt like she had an empty
nest, and she says she found her quiet house
unsettling.
One day Lynne, who ran a daycare out of
their home for 25 years, got a call that
changed her life. She was told there were a
few desperate kids who needed a home right
away. Lynne instantly stepped up and took
them in. It happened so quickly, Myron, a law
enforcement officer for 25 years, says he
doesn’t even remember Lynne talking to him
about taking on such a big responsibility.
Lynne says she did.
Since that day 18 years ago, the Malnaas
continue to provide a safe haven for many
kids in need. They have welcomed more than
150 foster children into their home, embracing
them with the unconditional love they need.
Lynne and Myron nurture and care for the
kids, who come to them from various back-
grounds. They watch them grow and give the
opportunity to let the kids be kids.
Lynne and Myron have also adopted two
children and are guardians to another.
For their commitment to Montana’s children,
Lynne and Myron were recognized recently as
2019 Angels in Adoption honorees.
Madam Speaker, for freely giving over 150
foster children unconditional love and a home,
I recognize Lynne and Myron Malnaa for their
Spirit of Montana.

WENDELL ‘‘SKIP’’ BROWNFIELD
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise be-
fore you today to recognize Wendell ‘‘Skip’’
Brownfield for his heroic service in the United
States Army during the Vietnam War.
On February 5, 1970, Skip and nine others
set out to a location where increased enemy
activity had been noticed. In route, Skip’s unit
triggered a booby trap, detonating a large ex-
plosive. The explosion was followed by heavy
enemy fire.
During the attack, two members of Skip’s
unit were injured. Despite the enemy fire, Skip
and a fellow soldier got the two injured men to
an opening so that a helicopter could rescue
them.
Skip Brownfield’s heroism that night was not
the only time he served meritoriously in battle
during the Vietnam War. For actions he took
in previous engagements with enemy forces,
Skip was awarded a Bronze Star with ‘‘V’’ de-
vice and Air Medal with ‘‘V’’ Device, among
other decorations.
Madam Speaker, I wish to send my most
sincere gratitude to Mr. Brownfield for his
service to our nation. Skip is a hero to us all.

OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise
to recognize Leith Daghistani for his service in
my office in Washington, DC.
Leith joined our office as a legislative fellow
and served as an advisor for my work on the
House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, in ad-
dition to handling a policy portfolio that in-
cluded defense, foreign affairs, agriculture,
and trade. Among other accomplishments, he
developed multiple pieces of legislation to im-
prove health care delivery at the VA and
helped our agricultural community navigate a
challenging year of tough weather and unprec-
edented trade tensions. Leith was also instru-
mental in ensuring House passage of the Vet-
erans’ Care Quality Transparency Act and the
Caring For Our Women Veterans Act.
Leith’s diligence, intelligence, and compas-
sion were invaluable assets as we worked to
establish our legislative operation from scratch
during my first year in office. I commend his
drive to advance mental health and suicide
prevention services for veterans and to im-
prove outcomes for women veterans and
younger veterans. Although Leith may be leav-
ing our office, our veterans in northern Illinois
and our community that supports and honors
them will continue to benefit from the results
of his hard work and expertise.
Prior to joining my staff, Leith earned a
Bachelor of Science from the United States
Naval Academy and served our country as an
officer in the United States Navy. I am grateful
he chose to continue his career in public serv-
ice by joining my office. Our office will miss his
kindness, diligence, sense of humor, and
expertly-brewed coffee.
Madam Speaker, I would like to formally
thank Leith Daghistani for his service to my of-
fice, to Illinois’s 14th Congressional District,
and to our country.

the substantial cost savings that have been
accrued from early investments in maternal
and child nutrition.
On November 11, 2019, the first wave of
WIC sites in Orange County began providing
food benefits in a new way—through the Cali-
fornia WIC Card. Previously, families served
by WIC received paper vouchers instead. This
change is expected to greatly improve the
WIC participant experience, while also improv-
ing the reimbursement experience for WIC
vendors to ensure the dollars redeemed in
stores in our community are received more ef-
ficiently.
I ask all members to join me in recognizing
the extraordinary work and contributions of
California WIC and their efforts to modernize
operations to ensure a better and more effi-
cient experience for all who participate.

OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Vickie Hartman Nicks.
Vickie was born on July 9, 1953 in Thomas-
ville, North Carolina. She graduated from East
Davidson High School in 1971 and married
Steve Nicks in 1979. In 1981, she took a posi-
tion as the Secretary of Mt. Zion Wesleyan
Church, where she worked for 38 years.
While being the church secretary certainly
kept her busy, her devotion to the community
didn’t stop there. Vickie was involved in many
children and youth programs as well as being
a member of the choir. She enjoyed painting
and crafts and was known for her quick wit
and keen sense of humor.
Outside of being active in her church, Vickie
was even more proud of being a wife, mother,
grandmother, and lifelong resident of Davidson
County. She was an excellent role-model for
and steadfast supporter of her daughters,
Stefanie and Andrea, as well as her
grandsons Steven and Jacob.
Vickie’s enormous impact on the lives of her
loved ones is indelible, and will live on for
years to come.
Vickie lost her life to a long drawn out battle
with cancer but her grit and tenacity never let
her lose faith. Recently, I had the opportunity
to meet with her husband, Steve Nicks, to
learn about Vickie’s bravery while facing the
final stages of her life. Her battle with cancer
was truly heartbreaking, representing a tragic
loss to our Davidson County community. Her
determination and grace provides an example
to us all.
Today I wear this bracelet given to me by
her husband that states, ‘‘Vickie Strong.’’ I
wear it today in her memory.
Madam Speaker, please join me in praying
for Vickie along with her husband Steve and
the entire Nicks family.
CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND
WORK OF MARLENE DILILLO
HON. JOHN R. CARTER
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to celebrate the life and work of
Marlene DiLillo, the former Executive Director
of the Greater Killeen Community Clinic, as
she retires after years of incredible public
service. With her ‘‘can-do’’ spirit and high-
minded vision, she’s a model citizen and trust-
ed community leader.
During Marlene’s nearly two decades as
manager of a medical clinic, she has always
shown great respect and support for both staff
and colleagues as well as a willingness to
make tough decisions. As the Executive Direc-
tor, she worked tirelessly to nurture relation-
ships with other community organizations, by
convening and collaborating around commu-
nity needs, and actively participating with gov-
ernment agencies, nonprofits, businesses and
community leaders, and elected officials.
Marlene signs all her emails with the stirring
words ‘‘Our job is not to climb the ladder of
success, but to descend the ladder of
servanthood.’’ All who’ve been blessed by her
presence know that to her this isn’t a mean-
ingless expression but a deep and lasting
creed that has been the guiding force of the
life of a true and devoted public servant.
Marlene DiLillo’s retirement is the richly-de-
served beginning of an exciting journey. I join
her colleagues, family, and friends in honoring
her career, commending her commitment to
public service, and wishing my friend nothing
but the best in the years ahead.

SIONAL VETERAN COMMENDA-
TION
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Karen Semple of Montana
City for the Montana Congressional Veteran
Commendation for her service and dedication
to her community.
Ms. Semple served in the United States Air

erans with moral injury, PTSD, and suicide
ideation. In addition, Ms. Semple serves as a
volunteer firefighter, and the American Legion
of Montana Disaster Emergency Response
Coordinator.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in
commending Karen Semple for her dedication
and service to her community.

HONORING THE CONNECTICUT
STATE LIBRARY’S ‘‘DIGGING
INTO HISTORY’’ PROGRAM
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it gives
me great pleasure to rise today to take a mo-
ment to recognize an extraordinary program
sponsored by the Connecticut State Library—
‘‘Digging Into History.’’ This extraordinary pro-
gram brought together fifteen Connecticut high
school students, five of which I am proud to
say are from my District, to take part in a
unique learning experience and community
service project.
The first German offensive against Amer-
ican troops during World War I took place on
April 20, 1918 in the village of Seicheprey,
France. It was Connecticut troops from the
102nd Infantry Regiment, also known as the
‘‘Yankee Division,’’ that came under attack
that morning as the German forces launched
the surprise offensive. The battle of
Seicheprey occurred on the southern side of
the St. Mihiel salient. There, three companies
of the Yankee Division’s 102nd Regiment oc-
cupied a trench, known as the Sibille trench.
The battle raged throughout the day with
heavy losses on both sides and the village
was destroyed. After the war’s end, Con-
necticut citizens collected $5,000 to help re-
build the water supply and installed a fountain
with a plaque in the town square. A bond had
been forged between Connecticut and
Seicheprey.
In recognition of the 100th anniversary of
this battle and as a way to strengthen that
bond, the ‘‘Digging Into History’’ program was
created. The program brought fifteen Con-
necticut high school students to Seicheprey to
take part in a community service project to
clear and restore a section of the trenches
Connecticut soldiers occupied, with the goal of
creating a historic attraction to help spur tour-
ism in the region. The students worked with
sixteen French students as well as military his-
torians to clear vegetation from the trenches,
re-dig sections and restore the trenches to
how they appeared a century ago.
It was an extraordinary opportunity for these
young people, bringing the history of World
War I to life for them, and today they are shar-
ing that experience with the presentation of
‘‘Digging Into History: Back From the Trench-
es.’’ Having had visited Normandy and other
such sites myself, I can imagine how thrilling
this project must have been. Though Congres-
sional business keeps me in Washington for
the event in Hartford, I hope to be able to see
the presentation myself soon.
These fifteen young men and women have
been incredible ambassadors for their commu-
nities, the State of Connecticut, and our na-
tion. I am honored to have this opportunity to
extend my heartfelt congratulations to them for
their remarkable work on this project. I also
want to extend my deepest thanks and appre-
ciation to the Connecticut State Library for
their work to organize this once in a lifetime
experience for these young people. I have no
doubt it is a journey they will never forget.
NEW HOME, NEW BYLAWS, SAME
MISSION: WPAOG HISTORY PART
IV (1996–2019) SECTION A
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, November 14, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to include in the RECORD Section A of the
fourth and final installment of an article by
Keith J. Hamel honoring the 150th Anniversary
of the West Point Association of Graduates:
‘‘When the Association of Graduates of the
U.S. Military Academy moved into the Her-
bert Alumni Center in the winter of 1995, it
was primed to capitalize on its past and, in
the process, make new history as well. The
AOG began on May 22, 1869, when a group of
graduates, upon a suggestion from Robert
Anderson, Class of 1825, held its first organi-
zational meeting in the office of Dr. Horace
Webster, Class of 1818. Out of this meeting
came the Association’s mission: ‘‘. . . to
cherish the memories of our Alma Mater,
and to promote the social intercourse and
fraternal fellowship of its graduates.’’ Ever
since then, the AOG mission has been about
serving both West Point (‘‘Alma Mater’’) and
the Long Gray Line (‘‘its graduates’’).
In the first stage of its history (1869–1900),
covered in our Winter 2019 issue, AOG was in-
strumental in moving the remains of the
‘‘Father of the Academy,’’ Sylvanus Thayer,
Class of 1808, to the West Point Cemetery
and memorializing him with a statue. Also
during this era, one of AOG’s founding mem-
bers, George Cullum, Class of 1833, be-
queathed $250,000 to build a memorial hall at
West Point and $10,000 for ‘‘necessary ex-
penses’’ of the Association. In AOG’s second
stage (1901–45), outlined in our Spring 2019
issue, AOG raised money to purchase the
Sanctuary Window in the newly built Cadet
Chapel and introduced initiatives such as
‘‘Alumni Day’’ (first held on June 11, 1923)
and ASSEMBLY magazine (which debuted in
April 1942). The modern AOG (see the Sum-
mer 2019 issue) began to take shape in the
late 1940s with the establishment of the West
Point Alumni Foundation and the granting
of tax-exempt status by the IRS. Thanks to
these developments in AOG’s third era (1946–
95), fundraising for both the West Point Su-
perintendent’s Fund and AOG’s annual ap-
peal steadily grew, and in 1972, Major Gen-
eral William Knowlton ’43JAN, the 49th Su-
perintendent, removed the AOG active duty
officer from the Office of Assistant to the
Superintendent, freeing the Association to
solicit money for the Academy and to estab-
lish new services for graduates. To meet
these dual objectives, AOG created both a
Directorate of Development (fundraising)
and a Directorate of Alumni Affairs (fra-
ternal fellowship) in the 1970s and 1980s, set-
ting up the themes that dominate the
present era of its 150-year history.
1997–2002: THE BICENTENNIAL CAMPAIGN
In 1996, after AOG had moved into Herbert
Alumni Center, Edward ‘‘Shy’’ Meyer ’51,
Chairman of the Association, noted that it
was time for the Association to refocus its
fundraising efforts. ‘‘The bulk of money has
gone into the Alumni Center and alumni
type things rather than the Superintendent’s
projects,’’ Meyer said, according to the min-
utes of the October 1996 Board of Trustees
meeting. ‘‘With 2002 coming up for a target,
we have a responsibility as alumni to do
something for the Academy in the way of a
gift.’’ In June 1990, AOG’s Long Range Plan-
ning Committee had agreed to raise $100 mil-
lion in 10 years for USMA, based on a long-
range analysis of Academy needs through
2002. However, debate over whether to run an
Army Athletics Center Campaign or a Cadet
Leadership Opportunities Campaign in con-
junction with the Academy’s Bicentennial in
2002 slowed efforts to get the Bicentennial
Campaign fully underway. All that changed
in 1996. Now with focus provided by Meyer
and the West Point Fund Committee, chaired
by Jack Hammack ’49, and in partnership
with Lieutenant General Dan Christman ’65,
USMA’s 55th Superintendent, AOG’s fund-
raising moved into high gear, thanks in large
part to lessons learned in the campaign to
raise funds for Herbert Alumni Center. The
Bicentennial Campaign kicked off with a
goal to raise $150 million for West Point be-
tween 1997 and 2002.
In the six years preceding the Bicentennial
Campaign, the average AOG annual collec-
tion was $9.4 million, from fewer than 14,000
donors annually, but during the campaign,
those numbers jumped to $28.8 million and
21,000 donors per year. But even more than
raising more money and growing the donor
pool, the Bicentennial Campaign provided
the vehicle to aid AOG’s burgeoning matu-
rity. It made it necessary for the Association
to grow and professionalize, developing new
office systems where none had existed, estab-
lishing gift acceptance and donor recogni-
tion policies and procedures, and educating
graduates to overcome general objections of
some alumni toward fundraising. It also
transformed the physical, academic, and ex-
tracurricular landscape of West Point, be-
cause the result of the campaign was not
just ‘‘something for the Academy in the way
of a gift,’’ but a collection of many signifi-
cant and lasting gifts.
‘‘The response to the Bicentennial Cam-
paign was overwhelming,’’ said Tom Dyer
’67, who was Chairman of the West Point
Fund during most of the Bicentennial Cam-
paign, and who took over as AOG Chairman
in January 2002. When the campaign closed
on December 31, 2002, AOG had raised $218.6
million for West Point, nearly $70 million
more than its initial goal. What’s more,
nearly half of all West Point graduates had
given at least one gift. ‘‘Never in our wildest
dreams did we think we would finish having
raised nearly $220 million!’’ said Dyer, ad-
dressing the success of the Bicentennial
Campaign in his Chairman’s Letter in the
March/April 2003 issue of ASSEMBLY ‘‘What
a great tribute to [all graduates] and dear
friends who recognized how much the ‘mar-
gin of excellence’ enriches the cadets’ experi-
ence.’’
EXPANDING AOG SERVICES
While AOG’s Development team was busy
raising funds for the Bicentennial Campaign,
the AOG Alumni Support team was expand-
ing services to graduates across a broad spec-
trum of programs. In fact, according to one
Chairman and CEO Annual Report of this
era, ‘‘the most rapidly expanding activity
managed by the Association of Graduates is
its Alumni Support Program.’’
In November 1996, the team hosted the first
AOG Minority Alumni Conference. A year
prior, the Association established the Minor-
ity Outreach Committee with the mission to
enhance the participation of minority mem-
bers in AOG programs and activities. More
than 120 graduates and friends of West Point
attended the first conference, raising and
discussing issues of major concern to minor-
ity graduates. A second conference was held
in April 1998. Attended by 107 participants,
the objective of the conference was to trans-
late those issues identified in 1996 into ac-
tion plans to achieve specific objectives re-
lated to minority cadet recruiting, the expe-
rience of minority cadets at the Academy,
AOG support of minority graduates, and
fundraising for minority-related projects.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1448 November 14, 2019
Another new initiative that emerged dur-
ing this time was the 50-Year Affiliation Pro-
gram. In 1999, the Class of 1949 asked the Su-
perintendent if it could present second lieu-
tenant bars, inscribed with ‘‘49–99,’’ to the
graduates of the Class of 1999. The Super-
intendent agreed, and four members of the
Class of 1949 greeted each cadet as he or she
left the dais, diploma in hand, and presented
the bars. Called a ‘‘friend raising’’ program
by the Alumni Support team, the 50-year Af-
filiation Program later expanded to include
a class flag presented to the yearling class as
it completed summer training at Camp
Buckner and a class coin presented to the
cow class upon their taking the affirmation
oath. Today, the 50-Year Affiliation Program
features eight formal events and a handful of
unofficial events at which cadets ‘‘Grip
Hands’’ with those who preceded them a half-
century earlier, including R-Day, A-Day,
Plebe Class Crest Unveiling, Yearling CFT
Class Flag Presentation, Cow Affirmation,
Ring Weekend, Branch Night and Gradua-
tion.
Finally, in November 2000, AOG inaugu-
rated the Class Ring Memorial Program.
Proposed by Ron Turner ’58 in the May/June
1999 edition of ASSEMBLY, the ‘‘Ring Melt,’’
as it is more popularly known, has today be-
come one of AOG’s most revered traditions.
As described by Turner, the program in-
volves ‘‘graduates bequeathing (or graduates’
descendants donating) West Point class rings
for the specific purpose of incorporating the
gold into the class rings of future grad-
uates.’’ Demonstrating that he had a long-
term ‘‘tradition’’ in mind when he proposed
his idea, Turner also recommended retaining
some gold shavings after each melt so that
these could be placed in the following year’s
melt, thus ensuring each year’s ‘‘Memorial
Gold ingot . . . would contain some of every
ring donated.’’ To date, a total of 575 rings
have been donated, spanning the classes of
1896 to 1997. All graduates’ rings from the
classes of 2002–2020 contain this ‘‘legacy
gold’’ from the Class Ring Memorial Pro-
gram.
NEW GOVERNANCE, NEW OPERATIONS
With growth in the number of services it
offered and the amount of money it was rais-
ing, AOG began considering changes to its
organizational structure soon after the con-
clusion of the Bicentennial Campaign. At the
same time, legislation proposed by New
York’s Attorney General requiring non-prof-
it organizations in the state to follow prac-
tices similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley cor-
porate reforms, which Congress enacted dur-
ing this period, also prompted AOG to con-
sider changes to its governance model. Thus,
in 2003, AOG formed the 2020 Governance
Committee, which presented the results of
its yearlong study to the Board of Trustees
in January 2005.
According to the Governance Committee’s
findings, the AOG board structure of the
time was inefficient: ‘‘too many people for
effective ideas, too infrequent for full consid-
eration, too little time for all issues, too
cumbersome to act as needs demand.’’ Fur-
thermore, in the opinion of AOG’s legal
counsel at the time, the early 2000s govern-
ance model left its 54 Trustees exposed to po-
tential personal liability. The Governance
Committee’s solution was the creation of a
smaller Board of Directors (12–16 members),
plus Chairman and Vice-Chairman, who
would be legally and fiduciarily responsible
for the Association, supported by a larger 57-
member (ultimately reduced to 54-member)
Advisory Council made up of a representa-
tive group of class, society, and at-large
members. The Governance Committee be-
lieved that the Advisory Council would pro-
vide AOG with broad graduate representa-
tion and participation while also accessing a
wide diversity of skills and experiences.
They also felt that service on the Advisory
Council would be excellent training for fu-
ture Board of Directors members. An addi-
tional change to note, the Governance Com-
mittee concluded that role of Chief Execu-
tive Officer should not remain with the
Chairman but transfer to the AOG President,
the person on-site in Herbert Alumni Center,
who would have authority over the day-to-
day affairs of the Association and the man-
agement of its staff. After careful consider-
ation and multiple compromises, the mod-
ernization and rewrite of AOG’s Bylaws was
completed and voted on in March 2005, elec-
tions were held in the fall of 2005, and, for
the first time since the 1920s, a new model of
AOG governance took effect on January 1,
2006 under the chairmanship of Ted Stroup
’62.
A year after receiving its new streamlined
model of governance, AOG received a new
name: the ‘‘West Point Association of Grad-
uates’’ (WPAOG). Board of Trustee minutes
show that AOG’s Strategic Planning Com-
mittee had been considering the name
change since 1998, as part of a larger effort to
change the fundraising, marketing, and busi-
ness organization efforts of the Association,
but it wasn’t implemented until WPAOG
launched its redesigned website in Sep-
tember 2007. The timing of this coincided
with ‘‘AOG Strategic Plan 2010,’’ which the
Board considered in May 2007. One of the
considerations under discussion during this
meeting was branding, and the Association’s
new name now incorporated what many con-
sider to be one of the world’s premiere
brands—West Point.
The new website was the product of
WPAOG’s Information Systems Department
(ISD), which had been established in 1996 to
build and maintain AOG’s hardware and soft-
ware infrastructures. ISD also developed and
executed the AOG Information Strategic
Plan, which leveraged existing technology to
enhance the ability to communicate infor-
mation quickly via electronic means. In 1997,
this plan led to a test program that provided
classes with a notification of the death of
one its members within 24 hours after con-
firmation by AOG. That same year, AOG pur-
chased software that enabled it to create
real-time distribution of news items and ar-
ticles. This was the beginning of today’s
Death Notification System (DNS), which
each day receives and verifies death notifica-
tions and then sends out daily updates to
Class and Society leaders (on average 400 per
year).
Given the emphasis on improving commu-
nication with graduate members and on in-
creasing awareness of the new WPAOG name
change, it wasn’t long before the Association
created a specific department to address
both needs. Effective communication had
been a decade-long goal of AOG by 2009, and
in August of that year, the Association
began to seriously consider establishing an
integrated communications team. One of the
questions facing WPAOG at the time was
what to do with ASSEMBLY magazine. Al-
though beloved by many graduates, by 2009,
less than 20 percent were subscribing to the
magazine, which meant that the majority of
graduates were not receiving news from their
alma mater. After much discussion and de-
liberation, WPAOG elected to follow the
model of several peer alumni associations
and produce a new quarterly magazine that
would be mailed out free of charge to all
graduates. West Point magazine debuted in
January 2011, and in February WPAOG’s
Publications Directorate became part of the
new Department of Communications and
Marketing, which was charged with mas-
tering new communications technologies in
the internet era, becoming an ongoing source
of information for graduates and promoting
participation in WPAOG services.
At the same time, WPAOG’s Finance De-
partment continued its management of gift
funds and endowments for West Point and
the Long Gray Line, aided by expert advice
from the Investment Committee. Today,
WPAOG manages more than $380 million in
endowment funds, and the Association has
received the highest rankings for trans-
parency and efficient funds management
from non-profit watchdogs Guidestar (Plat-
inum) and Charity Navigator (4 stars).
In the early 2000s, AOG tried an innovative
approach to building gift funded brick and
mortar projects, which now encompass both
new construction and renovation. WPAOG
successfully managed the planning, design
and construction of the Hoffman Press Box
in 2002–03 and proffered the completed
project as a gift to the government. The suc-
cess of this approach led to it becoming the
new model for gift-funded construction at
West Point, and by 2019 WPAOG had com-
pleted over 170 projects, representing more
than $250 million donated by members of the
Long Gray Line’’.
