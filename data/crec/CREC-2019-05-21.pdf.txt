DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,
May 21, 2019.
I hereby appoint the Honorable BRENDA L.
LAWRENCE to act as Speaker pro tempore on
this day.
NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
f
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by
the majority and minority leaders for
morning-hour debate.
The Chair will alternate recognition

MEMORIALIZING POLICE OFFICERS
WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE
LINE OF DUTY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes.
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in the wake of National Police
Week to memorialize our officers who
lost their lives in the line of duty.
Nearly 3 years ago, on October 8, 2016,
Officers Lesley Zerebny and Gil Vega
from the Palm Springs Police Depart-
ment were shot and killed in the line of
duty responding to what appeared to be
a routine domestic disturbance.
Through this tragedy, our commu-
nity came together, not only to re-
member Officers Zerebny and Vega, but
to do more for their families and the
entire law enforcement community.
Together, we found that families of
fallen first responders, those who gave
their all to protect us all, are being
shortchanged. That is why I introduced
the Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gil
Vega First Responder Survivor Support
Act, to honor those who have passed by
serving the living.
My bill will increase the Public Safe-
ty Officer Benefit from $350,000 to
$500,000 in order to pay off the cal-
culated national average debt most
families have; it will increase the
monthly education benefit from $1,024
per month to $2,000 per month to en-
sure they can afford the actual rising
costs of an education; and it will fix a
bureaucratic loophole that, due to un-
necessary red tape and delays in receiv-
ing benefits, can cost families up to
tens of thousands of dollars through no
fault of their own.
I urge all Members of Congress to do
the right thing: to follow words with
action, to follow praise with pragmatic
solutions that will improve the lives of
fallen first responders’ families. I hope
that all Members will cosponsor and
support my bipartisan Heroes Lesley
Zerebny and Gil Vega First Responder
Survivors Support Act.
I urge the Speaker to bring it up for
a vote immediately. Let’s support this
bill and stand up for the families of
fallen officers who have sacrificed so
much for us.
f
INTERRUPTED FAMILY DINNERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, a ques-
tion for those watching at home.
Do you have a cell phone?
Has your family dinner been inter-
rupted by a local call, only to realize
that it was spam?
This is incredibly frustrating and be-
coming all too common. In 2017, under
4 percent of cell phone calls were spam.
In 2018, the number jumped to almost
30 percent.
This year spam calls are expected to
rise up to the point of half of all cell
phone calls. That is why I am cospon-
soring the TRACED Act. This bill gives
the FCC broader authority to find
scammers and increase penalties for
those who are caught.
If you have a cell phone, this legisla-
tion will save you a lot of frustration
and make those times at home with
your family maybe a little bit more en-
joyable.
I hope my colleagues will join me in
supporting this commonsense legisla-
tion.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON’T TRUST
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, the
American people don’t trust Wash-
ington, D.C. And I know that shocks
everyone, but it is a perception that
every one of us deals with back home,
and after what the majority party
pulled last week, it is easy to under-
stand why.
Three—get it, three—bipartisan pre-
scription drug pricing bills made it
through committee and were ready to
vote on.
Now let me say that one more time.
Bipartisan healthcare bills, three of
them; that is unheard of around here.
But then politics got in the way. The
majority decided to add an unrelated
poison pill to drive away the Repub-
lican support. This healthcare package
now has no chance of being considered
in the Senate and will never become
law.
That is why I urge the majority to
bring to the floor H.R. 2700. This legis-
lation includes only the three bipar-
tisan prescription drug pricing bills, no
poison pills.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4014 May 21, 2019
Let’s come together to address the
problem. The American people deserve
better than the cynical political games
that we are playing.
CELEBRATING THE 19TH AMENDMENT
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, Susan B.
Anthony once said: ‘‘There will never
be complete equality until women
themselves help to make laws and elect
lawmakers’’—and serve as lawmakers
and actually serve in the chair.
One hundred years ago, Congress
moved one step closer to equality by
passing a constitutional Amendment
granting women the right to vote.
This week, we celebrate the 19th
Amendment. To honor the courageous
women who ushered us toward a more
perfect Union, we wear yellow roses.
I have two daughters. I have seven
granddaughters. I am thankful that
they can shape their government be-
cause of the generations of women who
came before them.
f
IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise, with love of country
in my heart and a belief that the Con-
stitution ought to be honored.
Today I rise, some 34 days since the
Mueller report has been made public, 34
days since we have concluded that im-
peachable offenses have been com-
mitted—34 days, and yet the President
still commits actions that are deemed
obstructive; 34 days, which means that,
for 34 days now, the President is clear-
ly above the law as it relates to the
Mueller report—longer than that, but
as it relates to the Mueller report and
its being released, 34 days.
But there is good news. A good many
Members are now considering joining
the impeachment effort, and I salute
them. I am more than honored to say
that you can never be too late when it
comes to being on the right side of his-
tory and the right side of justice. So I
salute them, and I believe that others
will come on board as well.
I believe they are doing this because
they believe that no one is above the
law. I think they are doing this be-
cause they believe that you have to put
principle above politics. They are doing
this because I think they love their
country, and they refuse to allow this
condition to continue without the con-
stitutional remedy of impeachment
being given its proper place in history
as it relates to this President.
And as they do this, I just want to re-
mind us that there is something that is
indelible in my mind. I will never for-
get this image: a baby.
This is a baby crying. I won’t forget
this image. For this alone, we should
consider impeachment. Separating ba-
bies from their parents without a
means of reuniting them, for this
alone, we should consider impeach-
ment.
But there is much more to add: the
whole notion that there are s-hole
countries in Africa; that there are very
fine people among those who were in
Charlottesville where a person lost her
life; the whole notion that the Chief
Executive Officer of the United States
of America, the President, will stand
before law enforcement personnel and
say: You don’t have to be nice when
you are bringing people into your care,
custody, and control.
And last night, to go to a rally—this
is the President of the United States at
a rally with people behind him saying,
‘‘lock her up,’’ or some equivalent.
This is not some outlaw, renegade
country. This is the United States of
America. Do we want the President of
this country to go before the public
and have throngs of people shouting,
‘‘Lock her up?’’
This is a great country. I love my
country, and, for this reason, I want to
assure my friends that I am going to
thank all who are coming on board.
And the question is not, now: Who is
going to be the first to come on board?
The question really is this: Who will be
the last to come on board? Who will be
the last person to say: ‘‘I believe that
no person is above the law’’? Who will
be the last to say: ‘‘I am going to do
what I believe the Constitution re-
quires when we have a person who has
demonstrated that he is a lawless,
ruthless, reckless person who happens
to have control of the executive branch
of government’’?
It is my belief that sometimes you
stand alone and it is better to stand
alone than not stand at all. But I also
understand that sometimes, when you
stand alone, it is just a matter of time
before others will stand with you.
I compliment all who are standing
with us today, who have been here
from the genesis of this.
Madam Speaker, I want to say one
final thing.
This is not about whether you are a
Republican or a Democrat. I com-
pliment the Republican who had the
courage to step forward, the courage,
the intestinal fortitude to take the
stand for righteousness: Believe me, he
won’t be the last. There will be others.
It is just a matter of time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL VET-
ERANS CEMETERY ON THE
SOUTH PLAINS OF WEST TEXAS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in strong support of the ef-
fort to establish a national veterans
cemetery on the south plains of west
Texas.
Dating back to the Civil War, the 147
national cemeteries across America are
a powerful way to honor those who
have gone before us who wore the uni-
form of the United States and remind
us every day of the 1 percent of Ameri-
cans who were willing to sacrifice ev-
erything in defense of our freedom and
security.
For some, they serve as what Presi-
dent Lincoln called ‘‘a final resting
place for those who gave their lives
that our Nation might live.’’
Yesterday, I had the privilege of
meeting with several distinguished vet-
erans who have made it their mission
to see this vision become a reality.
b 1015
Among them were four generals, who
have chosen to reside in a little slice of
heaven that Chairman MIKE CONAWAY
and I call west Texas. I am so honored
that they are with us here today in the
gallery.
General Edgar Murphy was the com-
manding general of the 49th Armored
Division of the Army National Guard
for the State of Texas. In his distin-
guished 42-year military career, he was
awarded numerous medals, including
the Legion of Merit. Today the Armed
Forces Guard and Reserve Center in
Lubbock is named in General Murphy’s
honor.
General Anne Sobel is a former major
general in the Arizona Air National
Guard who served as the first female
homeland security director for the
State of New Mexico. Today she con-
tinues by serving and teaching at my
alma mater, Texas Tech University.
Brigadier General Gary Harber is a
veteran with 42 years of service and a
master army aviator. General Harber
also served as the NATO northern re-
gional wartime construction manager
and commander from 1989 to 1995, re-
sponsible for the United Kingdom, Nor-
way, and Denmark.
Last but certainly not least is my
good friend Lieutenant General Bernie
Mittemeyer. General Mittemeyer
served 28 years in the U.S. Army, earn-
ing numerous awards and decorations.
He served as our Surgeon General of
the Army from 1981 until his retire-
ment in 1985, and he also served as
commanding general of the Walter
Reed Army Medical Center in Wash-
ington, D.C.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rep-
resent over 40,000 veterans in my dis-
trict and rural America. If you take
into consideration eastern New Mexico
that this national cemetery would
serve, it is over 70,000 veterans.
We must ensure that the commit-
ment we make to our veterans isn’t re-
served only for those veterans living in
population centers, whether it is long-
term care, services for the disabled, or
respect that is owed our honored dead.
We must never forget all veterans, in-
cluding those living in rural parts of
our country.
Madam Speaker, no group of Ameri-
cans believes more adamantly in the
importance of a strong defense and the
mission of our military to keep us safe
and free than the good people of west
Texas.
Their duty was to serve. Our duty is
to remember them. One of the best

RECOGNIZING BOB DINGEMAN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. PETERS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. PETERS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the late Colonel
Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Dingeman, a decorated
veteran and beloved community leader
who dedicated his entire life to service.
Bob’s commitment to service began
when he was just a teenager. He was
living with his family in Hawaii and
serving in the Reserve Officers’ Train-
ing Corps when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor. Bob helped to get the
women and children to safety before
joining the defense of the base, and the
events of that day led Bob to a life of
military service.
He graduated from West Point in 1945
and went on to serve in World War II,
the Korean war, and the Vietnam war.
During his decades of service, Bob
earned a Silver Star, Soldier’s Medal,
Bronze Star, and Purple Heart.
After retiring from the Army, Bob
earned multiple master’s degrees and
worked as a college professor at San
Diego Miramar College, teaching math,
history, and political science.
Bob became a pillar of San Diego’s
Scripps Ranch community where he
and his wife, Gaye, and their children
made their home.
Bob helped create the town’s council,
the Scripps Ranch Civic Association;
organized many annual traditions, in-
cluding the Fourth of July Parade; and
established the community newsletter.
The Robert E. Dingeman Elementary
School opened in 1995, so named by the
San Diego Unified School District to
recognize Bob Dingeman’s accomplish-
ments in the community. The school
celebrates Bob Dingeman Day every
year on June 12, Bob’s birthday.
Scripps Ranch and San Diego are bet-
ter off for Bob’s leadership and his
community involvement. His legacy of
military and volunteer service will
continue to be an example for us all.
Please join me in honoring Bob
Dingeman for his dedication to Scripps
Ranch and his service to the country.
RECOGNIZING MARINE CORPS AIR STATION
MIRAMAR’S COMMITMENT TO ALTERNATIVE
ENERGY
Mr. PETERS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Marine Corps Air
Station Miramar on receiving a 2019
Secretary of Defense Environmental
Award.
The award recognizes Marine Corps
Air Station Miramar’s commitment to
protecting the environment while sup-
porting the mission of the military.
The United States Department of De-
fense is the world’s largest user of fos-
sil fuels, and when the price of those
fuels spike, it harms our mission. That
is why the Marine Corps views energy
security as national security.
The marines at Miramar have led on
energy storage research through a
partnership with the California Energy
Commission’s Electric Program Invest-
ment Charge and deployed a methane-
to-energy project from an onsite land-
fill that generates half the base’s en-
ergy.
MCAS Miramar’s installation-wide
microgrid delivers 100 percent renew-
able energy to the base. Its distribu-
tion can provide reliable energy to mis-
sion-critical facilities for 3 weeks if
they are ever disconnected from the
grid.
This achievement has wide implica-
tions for the Marines, San Diego, and
the way we power our world. Energy in-
novation has always come naturally to
the military, and MCAS Miramar em-
bodies San Diego’s forward-thinking
approach and commitment to sustain-
ability.
I thank Marine Corps Air Station
Miramar and all marines stationed
there for their service to our Nation. I
thank Marine Corps leadership for
their dedication to alternative energy.
Please join me in congratulating Ma-
rine Corps Air Station Miramar on the
2019 Secretary of Defense Environ-
mental Award.
RECOGNIZING NEW CHILDREN’S MUSEUM OF SAN
DIEGO
Mr. PETERS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the New Children’s
Museum of San Diego, winner of the
2019 National Medal for Museum and
Library Service. This award is the
highest honor given to museums that
demonstrate extraordinary and innova-
tive approaches to community service.
The New Children’s Museum, which
will celebrate its 36th anniversary this
year, is a cornerstone of arts and cul-
ture for San Diego families.
The museum is certainly a model for
engaging people of all backgrounds
with art. They collaborate with com-
munity centers, social service organi-
zations, and schools to spread art, cre-
ativity, and play outside the museum.
The New Children’s Museum employs
a philosophy that enables children to
learn through play. Their philosophy is
pervasive in their immersive exhibits
that allow children to climb, touch,
build, and engage with the art.
I brought my own children there to
think, play, and create, like so many
families, when they were younger.
Today, the museum offers free and
reduced admission for military fami-
lies, Head Start groups, homeless and
foster children, migrant families, and
more.
This award is a testament to the New
Children’s Museum’s service to San
Diegans.
Please join me in honoring the New
Children’s Museum.

HONORING SENATOR RICHARD
LUGAR
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I
rise today with my House colleagues to
honor and remember Senator Richard
Lugar, a giant in Indiana politics who
recently passed away at the age of 87.
For those who had the privilege to
serve in Congress alongside Senator
Lugar, you simply could not find a bet-
ter mentor, colleague, and friend. Nor
could you find a more honorable and
decent individual.
Senator Lugar truly defined what it
meant to be a principled statesman,
dedicating his life to the betterment of
the world, our Nation, and the Hoosier
State.
From serving in the United States
Navy to being elected mayor of Indian-
apolis in 1968 and to his service in the
United States Senate from 1977 until
2013, he spent his entire life in service
to his Nation and his fellow Americans.
While Senator Lugar worked on a
wide variety of issues during his time
in office, it was in the realm of foreign
policy that he made the largest impact.
Senator Lugar’s knowledge of foreign
policy issues was unmatched. Our Na-
tion will forever be stronger and safer
because of his tireless efforts.
It was a privilege and honor to serve
alongside Senator Lugar during my
first term in Congress. As I stand here
today, it is truly humbling to say good-
bye to a man who inspired so many to
answer the call to service.
Our thoughts continue to be with his
beloved wife, Charlene; his sons, Mark,
Bob, John, David; and the rest of the
Lugar family.
May he have fair winds and following
seas. Godspeed.

MARKING THE CENTENNIAL OF
PASSAGE OF 19TH AMENDMENT
IN THE U.S. HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs.
TRAHAN). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ROUDA) for
5 minutes.
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to mark the 100th anniversary of
this Chamber’s passage of the 19th
Amendment guaranteeing women the
right to vote.
The battle for the 19th Amendment
was long and hard-fought. It was 72
years from the Seneca Falls Conven-
tion in 1848 to the affirmation in our
Constitution that women were owed
the right to vote.
But the ultimate goal was not just
the vote. It was what the vote means:
that American women, all women,
could enjoy the same rights and free-
doms as American men.
In the last 100 years, we remain well
short of that goal. In fact, this past
week’s latest assault on women’s bod-
ily autonomy is proof of that. The fact
that women make 80 cents on the dol-
lar compared to men, and much less for
women of color, shows that we have a
long way to go.
When there is so much work left to
do to realize full equality for all Amer-
ican citizens, we cannot afford to move
backward.

I am proud to serve with the largest

HONORING JIMMIE LEE MASON,
SR.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. CONAWAY) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor a longtime good
friend of mine named Jimmie Lee
Mason from Lubbock, Texas.
Jimmie Lee was a CPA, a consum-
mate professional, and someone who
took his profession very seriously and
helped create the firm Mason Warner,
which is in existence today.
Jimmie Lee passed away on April 5,
2019. He was 89 years old and leaves a
giant hole in the hearts of his family,
as you might expect.
I first met Jimmie Lee when I joined
the State Board of Accountancy in
Texas. Jimmie Lee, for whatever rea-
son, and I will now never know, chose
to take me under his wing. He
mentored me. He was a wise counselor.
As a result of his friendship and his
help, I was able to chair the State
Board of Accountancy, and I was able
to chair the National Association of
State Boards of Accountancy. I did
that work much better and more pro-
fessionally because of my friendship
and his leadership and help throughout
that process.
My story is only one of many, many
like it. Jimmie served the Texas State
Society of CPAs throughout his entire
career. There are countless other CPAs
who could have the exact same con-
versation with you that I am having
this morning as a result of his friend-
ship and his leadership.
Jimmie leaves behind a wife of 66
years, Wanda; son Jimmie Lee Mason,
Jr.; daughter Kristi Killion and her
husband, Jerry; son Greg and his wife,
Areace; and his grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.
Jimmie Lee, everywhere he touched
got better, whether it was a not-for-
profit organization in Lubbock that he
served or his profession that he served
diligently for all those years. Countless
individuals whom he came in contact
with are much better off, none more so
than the fellow who stands in front of
you here today.
My life is better as a result of my
friendship with Jimmie Lee Mason, and
I miss my friend.
COMMEMORATING 100 YEARS OF
WOMEN’S RIGHT TO VOTE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, one century ago today, the
United States House of Representatives
passed a constitutional amendment
granting women the right to vote. Just
1 year later, the 19th Amendment was
ratified.
Even before women had the right to
vote, women from Indiana were on
their feet, rallying their voices to be
heard. Hoosier suffragettes such as
Amanda Way, Zerelda Wallace, May
Wright Sewall, Helen Gougar, Dr.
Amelia Keller, and Grace Julian Clarke
led the push for suffrage in Indiana and
inspired Hoosier women to stand up
and speak out about their rights.
Each of these women and so many
more across the country paved the way
so that other women can now vote and
hold local, State, and Federal Govern-
ment positions.
It is an honor to be one of seven Con-
gresswomen elected thus far to rep-
resent the Hoosier State in our Na-
tion’s Capital, but it began with Rep-
resentative Virginia Ellis Jenckes, who
began her service in 1933; then Cecil
Murray Harden, who began her service
in 1949; Katie Hall in 1982; Jill Long
Thompson in 1989; Julia Carson in 2003;
and my good friend JACKIE WALORSKI
and I in 2013.
b 1030
Hoosier women have certainly left
their marks in America’s history book.
But, as I stand here today, I am struck
at how much work, yes, we still have
to do.
Exercising our right to vote is the
most powerful tool we have to share
our voice. Today, I join many col-
leagues here in the House wearing a
yellow rose commemorating the suf-
fragettes fight for our rights to vote.
So much has been accomplished by
women and for women in the past 100
years. Today, I want to encourage all
Americans to consider how much far-
ther we can go in the next 100 years.
f
CHARACTER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS) for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to reflect
on moral character, which is essential
to the promise of America in order for
us to flourish.
I am reminded that we stand on the
shoulders of so many who have gone
before us and impacted our lives in
many ways—members of our greatest
generation—who bravely fought tyr-
anny and oppression during World War
II. They were driven by honor, duty,
and country. They were selfless, not
drawing attention to themselves or
seeking to be a celebrity or a hero.
They are the models for character that
we must always celebrate and remem-
ber. They would never admit it, but
they are heroes, heroes for bravely and
humbly doing their part to protect our
freedom.
Madam Speaker, why is character so
important? Why does it matter? It is
because our character—who we are and
the decisions that we make when we
are tested—is foundational to the rule
of law.
In this body, we talk a lot about the
Constitution, our God-given rights,
bills and laws, checks and balances, the
rules and the procedures that govern
debate, the branches that make up this
government, and so on. All of these
pieces of our government are signifi-
cant, but they are lifeless and have no
meaning without the spirit of good
faith.
If we, representatives of the people,
don’t lead with moral character, Amer-
ica doesn’t stand a chance against cor-
ruption and the breakdown of trust
with the people we serve. It is on us,
each one of us, doing our part for what
is righteous, what is just, and for what
will keep America free.
President Reagan once said:
Freedom isn’t passed down to us in the
bloodstream; it has to be fought for.
In other words, freedom involves
choices, and that is precisely why char-
acter matters.
Every single day, every single mo-
ment, our character is tested. In poli-
tics, it is tested by the temptations of
power, palace intrigue, ambition, and
personalities.
I won’t blame either side of the aisle,
Madam Speaker, but these are the
smoldering fires that burn around us
that threaten our institutions and our
laws.
Did you know that only 3 percent of
Americans trust the government will
do the right thing—3 percent. Forty-six
percent of Americans say that they
have very little confidence in Congress.
That is a crisis of confidence, and it is
a call for reformation of character, so
that people will trust and can trust
that their representatives will always
act in good faith on their behalf.
Again, it starts with us being better
examples, not for the glory or the rec-
ognition, but because it is the right
thing to do. We must be countercul-
tural to the divisiveness that has taken
hold of modern politics today. That
means stopping the blame game, hon-
oring another’s argument, even when
we disagree, and acknowledging, and
even celebrating, our differences with-
out attacking the other side’s char-
acter. That is the way that we will
come together to find out how we can
make tough decisions without kicking
the can down the road.
I fear what may come if things do not
change. As Abraham Lincoln famously
said, ‘‘A House divided against itself
cannot stand.’’ The strength of our Na-
tion, our Constitution, our laws, and
our institutions have no greater guard-
ians than us. It is this government of

We must take this responsibility se-
riously or, again, we won’t have a
fighting chance to rebuild the trust of
‘‘we, the people’’ and keep the promise
of America alive. I have said it before
in the well of this House: this is the

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA
AGREEMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to urge my colleagues to
support the new trade agreement nego-
tiated with Mexico and Canada, or the
USMCA.
My district that I represent, the 11th
District of Pennsylvania, is one of the
top ten dairy producing counties in the
Nation and is the number one pro-
ducing county for egg layers.
One thing that I can tell you about
the farmers of the 11th District is that
they adapt, and they hold on to hope
that better times are yet to come. I
agree with them: better times are com-
ing for these farmers because the
Trump administration has worked to
do right by the American farmer in ne-
gotiating the USMCA.
Under the agreement, Canada would
eliminate its price control systems,
which have effectively locked out
America’s dairy industry.
The agreement also makes improve-
ments for the egg and poultry industry,
with Canada agreeing to increase its
quota regimes to allow for more Amer-
ican eggs and chicken into the market.
The farmers of my district are ea-
gerly calling for the USMCA to be en-
acted as soon as possible, and I join
them today in that call. I am hopeful
that we can get there.
That is why I urge the leadership
across the aisle to join in standing up
for our Nation’s farmers and to allow a
vote on the USMCA. We have a genera-
tional opportunity to help American
farmers compete and to thrive. Let’s
take that opportunity.
HONORING WARDEN CHERYL STEBERGER
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, ear-
lier this month was National Correc-
tional Officers and Employees Week,
and I rise today to recognize individ-
uals from Lancaster County, who are
making a difference improving crimi-
nal justice and public safety in our
community.
I would like to recognize Lancaster
County Prison Warden Cheryl
Steberger, who has shown exceptional
leadership in managing the Lancaster
County Prison. Warden Steberger has
substantially improved the welfare of
those repaying their debts to society
while in prison and helped with their
transition out of incarceration.
The warden has done so by meticu-
lously following the data with a pro-
gram known as Prison Stat. Prison
Stat is run in conjunction with the
Lancaster County Prison Board, led by
Lancaster County Commissioner and
Chairman Josh Parsons. This program
monitors key metrics on the prison’s
performance and holds leaders account-
able through transparent and frequent
public review of the data.
Their work in Lancaster County has
been honored by the National Associa-
tion of Counties, who awarded both
Commissioner Parsons and Warden
Steberger with the 2018 Achievement in
Criminal Justice and Public Safety
Award.
Madam Speaker, we appreciate the
work of our correctional officers and
we thank Warden Steberger for her
dedication and leadership.

NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, in
honor of National Foster Care Month, I
would like to address a vital issue in
today’s foster care system: the need for
more foster care parents. I would also
like to recognize a few foster care orga-
nizations in Nebraska’s Second Con-
gressional District. These organiza-
tions embrace children in the foster
care system and are committed to
helping youth find permanent homes
through foster parents, so that they,
too, can experience love, stability, and
the freedom to reach their full poten-
tial, regardless of their circumstances.
Lutheran Family Services of Ne-
braska has been an advocate in the
child foster care system for more than
125 years. This year, their mission is to
secure 100 foster families who can offer
a mature and stable environment.
Boys Town Nebraska, where I was
fortunate to speak this last weekend at
their high school graduation, directly
serves about 30,000 children every year
and believes that foster parents are the
heart of high-quality foster care by of-
fering children protection, perma-
nency, and comfort.
The Child Saving Institute values the
overall well-being of children by offer-
ing free, trauma-informed training to
individuals and couples who want to
serve as foster parents.
And the Nebraska Children’s Home
Society not only strives to find perma-
nent homes for children, but they also
address the need to foster teenagers.
All four of these organizations pro-
vide care and assistance to the abused
and neglected and encourages the need
for foster parents for children of all
ages.
Each year, hundreds of Nebraska
youth are removed from their homes
due to unfortunate circumstances.
Many of them fear where they will end
up or if they will ever find their forever
home.
My wife, Angie, and I adopted two
children, Austin and Jessica, from the
foster care system when they were just
8 and 9 years old. Even though we al-
ready had two sons, we knew that there
were not enough homes for older chil-
dren and siblings. Austin and Jessica
are blessings to our family. Even
though foster parenting was chal-
lenging, choosing to adopt them was
one of the best and most rewarding de-
cisions Angie, my wife, and I have ever
made.
Even though foster children are hurt-
ing, they are just looking for someone
to be committed to them and help
them succeed. It is time to realize that
everyone can play a part in enhancing
the lives of children and youth in fos-
ter care and that these children just
want someone to care for them. It is
the hope that one day, through oppor-
tunity and lessons, these children will
grow up and provide safety for their
own children, benefiting future genera-
tions.
The idea of children being placed
with stable and devoted families is not
a partisan issue. I am very appreciative
to my colleagues from both sides of the
aisle, and I am thankful to serve as a
co-chair for the Foster Care Caucus. I
will continue to be an advocate for fos-
ter children and encourage the need for
foster parents. We must remember that
every child, no matter the age, is wor-
thy of love and deserves a family.

HONORING MAJOR JOHN E.
CLECKNER, SR.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life of a great
man and a great patriot from Redding,
California, in my district. His commit-
ment to his fellow veterans is certainly
unparalleled. Major John Cleckner, Sr.
passed away on May 11, but he leaves
behind a tremendous legacy of service.
During a 22-year military career that
began in 1957 in the 82nd Airborne Divi-
sion and later the U.S. Army Special
Forces, John received far too many
awards and honors to list in this time.
During his time as a veteran of the
Vietnam war, he was wounded multiple
times and received three Purple Hearts
and two Bronze Stars.
In 1969, he was assigned to the 5th
Special Forces Group. Upon arriving,
he initiated a massive rebuilding of
their camp’s defenses and intelligence
gathering when he heard of increased
activity by North Vietnamese units in
the area. Not long afterward, a North
Vietnamese heavy weapons regiment
laid siege to their camp for 5 months,
but, thanks to John’s efforts, the camp
held.
After receiving his third Purple
Heart, John was medically retired in
1979.
As impressive as his military service
record is, it might even pale in com-
parison to his 35 years of dedicated

service to his fellow veterans, both in
northern California and across the
United States. Much like his military
career, his accomplishments as an ad-
vocate for veterans are too numerous
to properly list in this format.
He has worked closely with me and
my office and others previous to me
over the years as an adviser on all
things veterans related and as a tire-
less partner and champion of programs
and legislation that can make a real
impact to help our veterans thrive.
He was a leader in every sense of the
word. John was instrumental in get-
ting a new VA clinic in Redding, whose
groundbreaking will be very soon, and
started the quest for a veterans’ ceme-
tery in Shasta County, both of which
have now come to fruition, thanks to
his relentless efforts.
John even collaborated with country
music legend Merle Haggard, who is a
Redding resident, to coordinate a na-
tional fishing tournament for combat-
disabled veterans to have a chance to
get out and relax and enjoy the out-
doors with people who they can relate
to. For him, it was all part of making
the lives of veterans better in any way
that he could.
When John discovered that many
veterans struggled to obtain legal help,
he went back to college at the age of 62
to get a degree that would allow him to
serve as a legal assistant to in-need
veterans at no charge to the veteran.
That is amazing service. That is the
kind of person John Cleckner was.
For his impressive track record, both
on the battlefield and in civilian life,
the Special Operations Center of Excel-
lence at the U.S. Army John F. Ken-
nedy Special Warfare Center and
School inducted John into the Distin-
guished Members of Special Operations
Regiment in 2010.
b 1045
I know this: Major John Cleckner
was an American hero, on and off the
battlefield. He devoted his life to his
country, and when he could no longer
serve his country, he devoted himself
to improving the lives of his fellow vet-
erans.
I have seen it firsthand. I consider
myself fortunate to have known him as
a friend, and I am grateful for the
things he helped us—in my office and
others—do to accomplish things for
veterans in northern California.
John was tough, even a little scary,
especially if he thought you weren’t
being true to what you were saying you
would do. But if you were, you
wouldn’t have a stronger ally than
Major John Cleckner in what we pur-
sue to help our veterans, to help our
Nation be strong, to be true.
His commitment has only strength-
ened my own resolve to further some of
the initiatives he started and we have
helped with and to never stop fighting
for our veterans who deserve it.
I thank John for his service, his sac-
rifice, his dedication. We will miss him
in northern California but will ensure
his legacy lives on through our ef-
forts—all of us—to help our veterans,
to help our Nation remain strong.
God bless Major John Cleckner, his
faithful wife, Doris, his amazing fam-
ily, and all that he has ever had touch
with during his life of service to his na-
tion and to his brothers.

IN MEMORY OF TROOPER DONALD
C. BRACKETT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
it is with a heavy heart that I rise
today to honor the life and memory of
Trooper Donald C. Brackett, a dedi-
cated law enforcement professional
with the Pennsylvania State Police.
Trooper Brackett passed away while on
duty Saturday morning at the age of
58.
Our Nation just recognized National
Police Week, a time to reflect upon and
honor the sacrifices made by the men
and women in law enforcement. Troop-
er Brackett was no exception.
A resident of Bensalem, Trooper
Brackett served nearly 18 years in the
United States Marine Corps and en-
listed in the Pennsylvania State Police
in October of 2001. He was most re-
cently assigned to the patrol section of
Troop T, King of Prussia, and was pre-
viously assigned to Troop K, Media,
and Troop M in Trevose throughout his
distinguished career.
Madam Speaker, Trooper Brackett
lived his life in service to our Nation
and to our community. He is truly an
American hero, and I send my deepest
condolences to his wife, Marta, and his
children, Gabriella and Brianna.
Trooper Brackett lived his entire life
in service to our community. He set
the example for our entire Nation to
follow.
IN RECOGNITION OF PAUL STEKLENSKI
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize a native of
Perkasie in Bucks County, Pennsyl-
vania, who is promoting animal welfare
through the nonprofit organization he
established 4 years ago.
Paul Steklenski, an Army veteran
and a network engineer, founded Fly-
ing Fur Animal Rescue in 2015. Flying
his 1970 Beechcraft single-engine air-
plane, Paul transports shelter animals,
mostly dogs, at risk of being
euthanized to rescue groups along the
East Coast. To date, Paul estimates he
has saved the lives of over 1,300 ani-
mals in need.
Paul credits Rick Witt, who helps
manage the operations at Doylestown
Airport, for the success of this organi-
zation. Rick allows Paul to use the
original aircraft he used to transport
the animals.
Madam Speaker, I applaud the work
of Flying Fur Animal Rescue and
thank Paul for his work. I encourage
all of us to follow his lead of being a
voice for the voiceless.
RECOGNIZING BRUSH WITH THE
LAW
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
I rise to recognize an outstanding non-
profit organization in Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania, that is serving
individuals in need in our community.
Brush With the law, based in
Montgomeryville, was founded as a vis-
ual arts program at the Montgomery
County Correctional Facility in 2013.
The program quickly grew popular and
was transitioned into one that helps
marginalized individuals trying to re-
enter society.
Brush With the Law works with mu-
nicipalities and small businesses in
their endeavors, which involves cre-
ation of conceptual art installations to
beautify our community. These instal-
lations seek to raise awareness for
issues important to local residents,
such as drug addiction, homelessness,
and climate change. The principal goal
of Brush With the Law is to bring peo-
ple together, a vision which we all
should applaud.
I would like to recognize the founder
and director, Maria Maneos of North
Wales, for her leadership and for her
work in empowering our community.

MOVE ON FROM THE RUSSIAN
INVESTIGATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. OLSON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, on
April 18, 2019, my Democratic col-
leagues were overjoyed. The report on
the investigation into Russian inter-
ference in the 2016 Presidential elec-
tion was released. It was two volumes,
volume I and volume II. Volume I was
199 pages long, volume II, 182 pages
long.
Special Counsel Mueller’s report was
my colleagues’ dream: the smoking
gun. Now we can impeach President
Donald Trump. The taxpayers spent
$2.5 million so far, but that is a vic-
tory.
The folks back home heard this, one
ugly thud. There was no collusion and
no obstruction.
So why do my colleagues keep the in-
vestigation going? Why are they
threatening subpoenas, contempt of
Congress?
Well, it is because Mr. Putin hacked
into our elections with a wide open
door given to him by the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee,
the DCCC.
Volume I, page 38:
On April 12, 2016, the GRU, the Russians,
had gained access to the DCCC computers
using the credentials stolen from a DCCC
employee who had been successfully spear-
phished the week before.
A few lines later:
Approximately 6 days after the first hack
into the DCCC network on April 18, 2016, the
GRU—again, the Russians—gained access to
the DNC network via a virtual private net-
work connected between the DCCC and the
DNC.

Mr. Putin was not interfering in our
elections to help Mr. Trump. The re-
port shows he was motivated by the
fact of most of my people back home:
He wanted anybody but Mrs. Clinton.
Volume I, page 23:
Here is the main idea: Use any opportunity
to criticize Hillary and the rest—except for
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. We support
them.
It is time for my friends on the other
side of the aisle to admit they left the
barn door open, and Mr. Putin let those
cows out to run free in our elections.
It is over. Let’s move on. Join us in
doing the people’s work. That means
issues they care about, like how about
having lower unemployment? That is
historical right now for Asians, African
Americans, and Hispanic Americans.
Let’s give that a round of applause.
How about energy independence? Yes,
our world is clear because of American
energy.
How about helping us secure our bor-
der? Address the crisis on our border,
have an immigration policy that
works.
The American people want this. They
are sick and tired of investigation after

CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL
OF WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN) for
5 minutes.
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Madam Speaker, on June 4, we
will celebrate 100 years since Congress
passed the 19th Amendment, which cor-
rectly recognized women’s right to
vote.
At that time, only one woman had
served in Congress: Jeannette Rankin,
in 1916, from Montana. But today, we
have more women serving in this Con-
gress than ever before, with 131.
In this proud moment for both
women and our Nation’s history, we
also honor the suffragists who, more
than a century ago, paved the way that
allows women to take part in this
democratic process and that also al-
lows me to stand here as the first
woman elected to represent Puerto
Rico in Congress.
Because of our territorial status,
Puerto Rico has been historically ex-
cluded from our national process, in-
cluding the 19th Amendment ratifica-
tion process.
Prior to becoming a U.S. territory in
1898, Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony,
and people on the island advocated for
political equality for women, beginning
with a right to education. But it wasn’t
long after becoming a U.S. territory
that Susan B. Anthony advocated for
equal political and civil rights for men
and women in the new possessions, in-
cluding Puerto Rico.
This advance in civil rights was one
of the first reasons why people on the
island began to fight for the conversion
of Puerto Rico as a State of the Union.
It was the leaders of the Republican
party who first included women’s vote
as part of their platform, and they also
presented legislation to achieve it. As
the measure did not progress, our suf-
fragists sought support from national
organizations and the United States
Congress, which introduced legislation
extending women’s right to vote in
Puerto Rico.
Finally, in 1929, Puerto Rico’s Legis-
lature recognized the right to vote, but
only for literate women; and in 1935,
the right to vote was granted to all
women.
These series of events led to the elec-
tion of Maria Luisa Arcelay, who be-
came the first woman in Puerto Rico
to be elected to a government legisla-
tive body in 1932.
However, because Puerto Rico is an
incorporated territory of the United
States, despite being U.S. citizens since
1917, Puerto Ricans cannot vote for the
U.S. President, and they are also de-
nied voting representation in this Con-
gress.
While this Congress is legislating to
extend benefits to all women, I must
raise my voice many times to advocate
for these rights to be extended to terri-
tories like Puerto Rico that still lack,
at a general level, full equality in rela-
tion to a State.
Statehood for Puerto Rico will hap-
pen. The question is when this Con-
gress will do it.
The end of slavery, the end of seg-
regation, and women’s right to vote are
just examples of civil rights that took
a while to become the law of the land.
Statehood for Puerto Rico will follow.
We are still fighting for equal pay,
for equal work, for being able to walk
safely without fear of sexual harass-
ment, for eradicating gender violence,
for having more access to where deci-
sions are made, for having more rep-
resentation in different fields, such as
science, arts, sports, business, and eco-
nomics.
As we rejoice and celebrate progress
in equality for women, I ask my col-
leagues to be reminded that their job
continues and much more remains to
be done to achieve equality for all
Americans.
That also includes the veterans of
Puerto Rico, veterans that lack access
to TRICARE Prime options on the is-
land. Instead, only Active Duty serv-
icemembers and their family members
have access to TRICARE Prime, spe-
cifically TRICARE Prime Overseas.
This also affects the access by
spouses and dependents to benefits as
their family member serves our coun-
try.
Current law dictates that military
retirees under the age of 65 in Puerto
Rico and the territories are eligible
only for TRICARE Standard.
That is the reason I filed H.R. 2171,
which seeks to rectify this problem by
making TRICARE Prime available to
over 29,000 servicemembers in Puerto
Rico, who have retired from the Armed
Forces, and their dependents.
According to the report by the Con-
gressional Task Force on Economic
Growth in Puerto Rico, not having ac-
cess to TRICARE Prime is one way in
which Puerto Rico is treated dif-
ferently under several Federal pro-
grams.
I urge my colleagues to support H.R.
2171.

There was no objection.
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise

FAMILIES

Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam
Speaker, as we approach Memorial
Day, we are reminded of the brave serv-
icemen and -women who have given
their lives to defend our country.
The families of those who died in
conflict, known as the Gold Star fami-
lies, can never forget these sacrifices.
Our country is indebted to these self-
less Americans who made the ultimate
sacrifice.
No amount of financial support can
ease the pain of losing a loved one, but
veterans’ benefits to surviving spouses
and children provide an important life-
line during these times of need.
The 2017 tax law brought many unin-
tended consequences that Congress is
now trying to fix, including a signifi-
cant increase in tax rates on benefits
for children of these fallen service-
members. This is completely unaccept-
able. Congress must pass legislation to
fix this now so families that have al-
ready given so much are not asked to
give even more.

COMMEMORATING THE 19TH
AMENDMENT
(Mr. STEIL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, today
we celebrate an important moment in
our Nation’s history: 100 years ago,
today, Clifford Randall, the Represent-
ative from the First District of Wis-
consin, left his office like all of his col-
leagues in the House, walked to this
very Chamber, and cast his vote in
favor of women’s suffrage.
The 19th Amendment gave women
the right to vote. Today we commemo-
rate that vote.
Wisconsin was a leader in the wom-
en’s suffrage movement. In fact, Wis-
consin was the first State to ratify the
19th Amendment.
I am wearing a yellow rose today just
as the supporters of women’s rights did
a century ago.
As we commemorate the 19th Amend-
ment, let’s focus on how we can work
together to support women and ensure
that future generations will never for-
get that historic vote.
f
EMPOWERING WOMEN
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
what an amazing day: 100 years ago,
the Congress voted out a resolution to
empower women with the right to vote.
What is interesting, the last day, the
last State, Tennessee, when the vote
was taken, or when it was about to be
taken, the then-Speaker, who was
against it, wearing a red rose, said: We
have got the votes.
But there is nothing like the power
of a woman and the power of a mother.
And a young legislator got a letter
from his mother that very morning
that said: Son, be a good boy, and vote
to let women vote.
And, lo and behold, Tennessee rati-
fied that right because that 24-year-old
voted to let women vote.
It is an important time now for
women to be empowered, because the
States of Alabama and Texas and Mis-
sissippi and Missouri and others are
now trying to reign back the rights of
women and the right to choose.
We respect other values. We respect
the Constitution and the Ninth Amend-
ment, but Alabama and Mississippi and
Texas and Missouri, we are not going
back, because women got the right to
vote. And just like that young man, be
a good boy and leave women alone, for
them to choose their own right, the
right to vote.

HONORING MADISON DOZIER
(Mr. MASSIE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in honor of my constituent Madi-
son Dozier of Alexandria, Kentucky.
Madison is an honor roll student at
Reiley Elementary and the daughter of
proud parents Ronnie and Melanie
Dozier.
Madison is also the 2019 national win-
ner of the annual National Missing
Children’s Day poster competition,
sponsored by the Office of Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention at
the Department of Justice.
Each year, all fifth graders in the
United States are invited to partici-
pate in the missing children’s day post-
er competition. The purpose of this
competition is to foster awareness and
discussion among schools and law en-
forcement regarding the tragedy of
missing and exploited children.
This year, Madison’s poster received
the national award, following a unani-
mous decision from the judging panel.
Congratulations to Madison and her
teacher and her proud family as they
visit Washington, D.C., for the awards
ceremony this week. Her poster will be
on display in the Great Hall at the De-
partment of Justice. Check it out.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PASSAGE
OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT
(Ms. SÁNCHEZ asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. SÁNCHEZ. Madam Speaker,
today marks the 100th anniversary of
the House passage of the 19th Amend-
ment, which gave women the right to
vote.
It is hard to think that, 100 years
later, for most of our Nation’s history,
including my grandmother’s and great-
grandmother’s generations, women
contributed to the building of our Na-
tion but lacked this basic civil right.
In America, your vote is your voice;
it is what makes all of us equal. We
each have one vote. Voting is one of
the most important things that you
can do as a citizen.
When the 19th Amendment passed
over 100 years ago, only one woman
served in the United States House of
Representatives. When I began my con-
gressional career here in 2003, 60
women were serving in the House.
Today, I am proud to serve in the
House with 127 women, including 14
other Latinas. That, my friends, is
progress.
While we have made significant im-
provements to expand the representa-
tion of women in our political system,
we still have a long way to go. So let

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PASSAGE
OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to commemorate the 100th
anniversary of the 19th Amendment
and the efforts of the women’s suffrage
movement in the United States.
Susan B. Anthony once said: ‘‘Oh, if I
could but live another century and see
the fruition of all the work for the
women. There is so much yet to be
done.’’
Now that we stand on the other side
of that century, it is only fitting that
we honor the suffragettes who paved
the way for millions of women to vote
and hold public office.
By a vote of 74–15, my home State of
Arkansas became the 12th State to rat-
ify the 19th Amendment.
I would like to specifically recognize
Ms. Hattie Wyatt Caraway from
Jonesboro, Arkansas, the first woman
to ever be elected to the United States
Senate and whose portrait is promi-
nently displayed outside the Senate
Chamber.
A truly representative democracy ne-
cessitates that all voices be heard, and
the 19th Amendment signified a turn-
ing point in government.
America’s legacy of strong women
continues on today in the lives of each
woman who casts a ballot and runs for
office. I am honored to serve alongside
many of these women.

WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to join in celebrating the
66th Congress.
100 years ago today, in 1919, this
House voted to pass the 19th Amend-
ment to grant women the right to vote.
I rise today to celebrate the women’s
suffrage movement and the women
who, at the time, were seen as revolu-
tionary for demanding a voice, a rep-
resentation in our democracy.
Today, we applaud the women who
organized in upstate New York, in Sen-
eca Falls, who marched down Pennsyl-
vania Avenue, and who lifted their
voices across this country to demand
‘‘votes for women.’’
As we prepare to celebrate a century
of women’s suffrage, let us acknowl-
edge the tireless work of women to de-
mand the right to vote and the women,
including Ulster County’s own So-
journer Truth, who recognized that suf-
frage still denied treatment under the
law for all.
Today, I am proud to celebrate the
tireless work of women to demand the
right to vote and the men who stood on
the right side of history by voting to
pass the 19th Amendment.
Their work set the stage for the his-
toric 116th Congress, full of trailblazing
women, and firsts in their own right.

CELEBRATING BOLD TRAIL-
BLAZERS OF WOMEN’S SUF-
FRAGE MOVEMENT
(Mrs. RODGERS of Washington asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend her remarks.)
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate the bold trailblazers like Susan
B. Anthony, a pro-life woman and Re-
publican, and others like Emma Smith
DeVoe and May Arkwright Hutton,
who both led the suffrage movement in
Washington State.
It was exactly 100 years ago today
that this body passed a constitutional
amendment granting women the right
to vote. Its leaders like Susan B. An-
thony and others have inspired genera-
tions of women to live their dreams, to
be courageous, and to be risk-takers.
They fought in search of a more perfect
union to make sure the promise of
America was available to women of all
walks of life so that we, the people, are
able to make our voices heard.
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for
them. I am honored to stand here
today, 100 years later. Their legacy re-
minds us all why we are empowered to
do our part and write the next chapter
of America’s history.

JOHN BOLTON BEATING DRUMS OF
WAR
(Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, if
you listen carefully, you can hear
drums faintly in the background. It is
not a prayer circle. It is John Bolton
down at the White House, beating the
drums of war.
This is the same John Bolton who
thought invading Iraq was a really,
really great idea. In fact, he said, ‘‘I ex-
pect that the American role actually
will be fairly minimal.’’ Minimal? The
greatest foreign policy mistake in the
history of the United States of Amer-
ica fairly minimal?
Now he wants to do the same thing in
Iran.
Iraq was one thing, with Saddam
Hussein in a relatively small country.
Iran? Really, buddy? He hasn’t seen
any problem around the world that you
can’t change by regime change: North
Korea, regime change; Venezuela, oh,
that worked out really well a couple of
weeks ago, regime change; now Iran.
What about Russia? He is kind of
quiet about Russia. I wonder why that
is. It might have something to do with
his boss.
Now, his boss goes back and forth:
War, no war. War, no war. I don’t
know.
We have to hope Bolton doesn’t win
this debate. He has never repented. He
said, in 2019, ‘‘I still think the decision
to overthrow Saddam was correct.’’
The same guy said, ‘‘I confess I had no
desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice
paddy.’’ Chicken hawk.

RECOGNIZING IMPORTANCE OF
19TH AMENDMENT
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, exactly 100 years ago
today, this House passed the 19th
Amendment. On June 4, 1919, the Sen-
ate approved it.
The women’s right to vote began the
race to ratification, requiring three-
fourths of the 48 States to ratify it be-
fore it was added to the Constitution.
That happened on August 26, 1920.
Madam Speaker, a woman having the
right to vote is not at all controversial
today. However, in 1848, when the first
women’s rights convention was held in
Seneca Falls, New York, the issue was
so contentious that the group of most-
ly women only narrowly passed includ-
ing voting rights in their Declaration
of Sentiments.
We know some of the leaders of the
movement, like Susan B. Anthony,
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Ida B.
Wells, but there are thousands of other
women whose names will never be
known. They also gave heart and cour-
age to ensuring equality for women.
The passage of the 19th Amendment
ensured that all Americans were in-
cluded in steering our Nation toward
the future. One hundred years later, it
remains just as important.

Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I

versary of the House passage of the
19th Amendment giving women the
right to vote.
Suffragettes across the country
bravely fought for decades to make
that moment possible, enduring hard-
ship and pervasive discrimination. I
think about trailblazing women like
Oregon’s Abigail Scott Duniway.
The right to vote empowered women
to shape policy, elevated public dis-
course, and more.
We have come a long way. There is a
record number of women not only vot-
ing but serving in Congress. With more
women at the table, I hope we will fi-
nally enact policies that support all
women and their rights, including the
right to make our own reproductive

We still have work to do. We must

ture women leaders of all backgrounds

great things.

19TH AMENDMENT ENSURED
WOMEN FULL PARTICIPATION IN
OUR DEMOCRACY
(Mrs. WAGNER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to support H. Res. 354, cele-
brating the 100th anniversary of this
body passing the 19th Amendment.
On May 21, 1919, the House of Rep-
resentatives approved a proposed
amendment to the Constitution that
provided suffrage for women. This
amendment not only ensured that all
women are full participants in our de-
mocracy, but it also ensured that the
United States is a full democracy.
Women and girls have always pos-
sessed the same fundamental rights as
men and are essential to a stable,
peaceful society.
On behalf of every woman in the Sec-
ond District of Missouri, I honor the
role that the ratification of the 19th
Amendment played in fulfilling the
principles of the Constitution for
women.
I commit to working to strengthen
our democracy as we remember re-
markable women like Susan B. An-
thony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and
others who fought for our freedoms.

CONTINUE FIGHTING FOR EQUAL
RIGHTS OF WOMEN
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker,
today, we recognize a historic day in
our Nation, the 100th anniversary of
the House passage of the 19th Amend-
ment, which, once ratified, granted
most women the right to vote, bringing
them one step closer to equality with
their male peers.
That ratification was 10 years in the
making. Sadly, this pace of progress,
this slow pace, is still all too common.
Throughout history, women have had
to fight for the same rights automati-
cally afforded to men. Today, that
fight continues.
As we stand on the shoulders of all
the women who challenged convention,
who fought and refused to quit so that
we could be here in a moment where
some 68 million women vote in Amer-
ica and the first two Latina women
represent Texas in the people’s House,
our responsibility is to continue that
fight against the erosion of women’s
rights that we are witnessing today
and to fight for equal treatment and
opportunity for all.
f
HONOR 19TH AMENDMENT BY
EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO VOTE
(Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker,
going door to door in my first cam-
paign, a sweet, elderly lady invited me
in for iced tea. As she discussed my
race, she shared that she had never
missed a chance to vote since she was
a young girl.
One day, her mother had hitched the
horses to the wagon, pulled up in front
of the house, told her to get in, flicked
the reins, and they were on their way
to town. With determination and pride,
her mother announced, ‘‘Today, for the
first time in our country, we get to
vote. We must always exercise this
privilege.’’ And that girl did, every
election, for over 74 years.
As we celebrate the 100th anniversary
of this Chamber passing the 19th
Amendment to our Constitution, giv-
ing women the right to vote, we must
all reflect on what this right to vote
truly means. I am grateful for this
privilege not only to vote on election
day but also to stand here and rep-
resent the good people of Missouri’s
Fourth District and cast their vote
here in Congress.
We live in the greatest country in the
world. Let us always remember those
who secured our freedoms and honor
their legacy by exercising the right to
vote.

HONORING COURAGEOUS WOMEN
WHO WON RIGHT TO VOTE
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute
and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Madam Speaker, just over 100
years ago, my mother was born with-
out the right to vote. Like other
women of her time, she had no vote,
and she had no voice in her govern-
ment.
Today, we honor the courageous
women who marched, staged hunger
strikes, went to jail, and persevered in
order to win this fundamental right for
half the country, forever altering our
democracy by ensuring that everyone
in this country, including women, had
the constitutional right to vote.
I am deeply grateful that my mother
benefited from their efforts and that
she would live to see her daughter run
for and be elected to Congress.
Millions of women voted for the first
time in November 1920 and in the near-
ly 100 years since. But we still have
much more work to do.
I am determined that, one day soon,
all of our daughters and sons will wit-
ness the ratification of the Equal
Rights Amendment, which, at long
last, makes it clear that equal means
equal.

CELEBRATING THOSE WHO
FOUGHT FOR WOMEN’S RIGHT TO
VOTE
(Mrs. LESKO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I am
proud to speak before the U.S. House of
Representatives in celebration of the
100th anniversary of the House passage
of the 19th Amendment that gave all
women the right to vote. This centen-
nial is one of the most important in
our Nation’s history, and I am thrilled
to be celebrating it with my colleagues
here on the House floor.
The fight for women’s suffrage in my
State of Arizona began when we were
still a territory in the 1800s. Brave
women, like Josephine Hughes of Tuc-
son, Frances Munds of Prescott, and
others, led the suffragist movement in
Arizona so that women in Arizona won
the right to vote even before the 19th
Amendment passed.
Let us celebrate the many women
and men who fought for so much over
so many years to ensure the right to
vote for women in America.
As the daughter of a great mother, as
the mother of a wonderful daughter,
and as the grandmother to a 1-week-old
granddaughter, I am so proud to be
here today to honor this great, historic
moment.

PROTECTING RIGHT TO CHOOSE
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-

Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, as
States like Alabama move forward im-
plementing medieval laws that seek to
imprison doctors and punish women for
their personal healthcare decisions, I
want to make one thing absolutely
clear: I will always stand up and defend
a woman’s fundamental right to
choose.
These near-total bans on abortion are
not only unconstitutional, but they
also endanger the lives of countless
women who will be forced to turn to
unsafe procedures.
In 1930, illegal abortion was listed as
the official cause of death for almost
2,700 women, nearly 20 percent of ma-
ternal deaths recorded that year.
We have come too far in the fight for
women’s equality to retreat to an era
when women lacked the basic right to
autonomy over their own bodies.
My district of Rochester, New York,
is the proud home of Susan B. An-
thony. Today, we commemorate the

HONORING SUFFRAGIST MARY
ANN SHADD CARY
(Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam
Speaker, I rise today, standing on the
achievements of brave women who
came before me, to commemorate the
centennial anniversary of the 19th
Amendment House passage, expanding
the right for women to vote.
As we celebrate this historic day, I
want to pay tribute to an overlooked
but trailblazing woman who helped
make it possible, Delaware pioneer and
suffragist, Mary Ann Shadd Cary. In
her prophetic words: ‘‘We should do
more and talk less.’’
Using the power of the pen, Shadd
Cary was the first woman to edit and
publish a newspaper in North America,
using that role to combat systemic rac-
ism and slavery.
After the Civil War, she set her
sights on a new cause: voting. She be-
came one of the first Black female law-
yers in the United States to testify be-
fore the House Judiciary Committee, in
1874, advocating for women’s suffrage
in these very Halls.
Described by W.E.B. Du Bois as
‘‘well-educated, vivacious, with deter-
mination shining from her sharp eyes,’’
Mary Ann Shadd Cary blazed trails for
women everywhere, and throughout
her life, always fought in the name of
justice and equality.
We owe it to her and we owe it to all
to continue to fight for our rights.

COMMEMORATION OF THE 100TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH
AMENDMENT
(Ms. BARRAGÁN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Madam Speaker, I
rise to commemorate the 100th anni-
versary of the passage of the 19th
Amendment, which granted women the
right to vote.
The 19th Amendment played a piv-
otal role in paving the way for a new
agenda that would finally put women’s
issues at the forefront of our democ-
racy. Not only did it help women move
closer to equality, it created more op-
portunities for jobs, fairer wages, ac-
cess to education, and more health ben-
efits. Eventually, more women began
to run for office.
Madam Speaker, 100 years later and
women have made an impact at the
ballot box like never before, electing a
record-breaking number of women to
Congress. But there is still work to be
done.
We are still fighting for full equality
for all women, including LGBTQ
women.
We are still fighting for reproductive
rights. We have seen countless States
enact laws that strip away a woman’s
reproductive freedom, criminalizing a
decision that should be between her
and her doctor. But core to women’s
constitutional liberties is autonomy
over their own body and well-being. In
order to truly support women, we need
to safeguard and improve, not limit,
access to comprehensive healthcare.
As we celebrate the strides that
women have made in our country, we
also recommit ourselves to the fight
that women have endured since the
founding of our Nation.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH
AMENDMENT
(Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker,
America has always been a work in
progress, and, therefore, we always
have the opportunity to make our de-
mocracy better, stronger, when we sim-
ply do the right thing.
The Declaration of Independence may
have said that ‘‘all men are created
equal,’’ but it took a brave group of
Americans to say that it should really
be ‘‘all people.’’ If the law applies to
each of us equally, then the right to
vote must always be equal.
The women who fought for their
right to vote weren’t in it to make
friends. They were mocked and beaten,
called extremists, told to slow down,
told that good things would come if
they simply waited. But, nevertheless,
they persisted.
Today, on the 100th anniversary of
the 19th Amendment passed in the
House, let’s be inspired by this group of
women who took the hard fight and did
the right thing, because they knew our
democracy would be stronger and bet-
ter for it.

YOU CAN’T BE WHAT YOU CAN’T
SEE
(Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker,
‘‘Young girls need to see role models in
whatever careers they may choose just
so they can picture themselves doing
that job some day. You can’t be what
you can’t see.’’
Madam Speaker, Sally Ride, the first
American woman in space, spoke those
words. She was a personal hero of
mine, one of the few women in STEM I
could look up to as a child. And to this
day, I am grateful to Sally because she
showed me, as a young girl, that being
a woman did not prevent her from pur-
suing her dream, from entering a male-
dominated world and space.
Yesterday, I spoke on television with
my friend Representative MIKIE
SHERRILL, about the launch of the first
ever Servicewomen and Women Vet-
erans Congressional Caucus, and it
turns out another young girl was
watching.
‘‘Why do those two girls have the
same necklace on?’’ she asked her fa-
ther, referring to my and Representa-
tive SHERRILL’s pins. Her father ex-
plained the meaning of the pin, ex-
plained how we were two women elect-
ed to serve in the United States Gov-
ernment.
True equality can only be achieved
when every young girl can look up to
her leaders and see herself reflected,
see a legitimate path for achieving her
dreams. For that, we need more women
in leadership, more people of color. Our
elected representatives need to be a
more accurate reflection of America
that we represent.
Maybe that young girl yesterday will
go into politics, maybe she won’t, but
she saw two women who were elected
by their peers to serve.
‘‘You can’t be what you can’t see.’’

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH
AMENDMENT
(Mr. COOPER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-

Mr. COOPER. Madam Speaker, as we
celebrate the 100th anniversary of the
vote to pass the 19th Amendment, I
would like to recognize Tennessee’s
crucial role in the Amendment’s ratifi-
cation.
State Representative Harry T. Burn
was a slow learner. He was originally
antisuffragist, but he ultimately
changed his ‘‘nay’’ vote to ‘‘yea’’ just
in time to heed his mother’s advice to
‘‘be a good boy’’ and vote for ratifica-
tion.
His was the deciding vote in the Ten-
nessee General Assembly, making Ten-
nessee the 36th State, and final State,
needed for ratification. Representative
Burn explained his vote this way: ‘‘I
know that a mother’s advice is always
safest for her boy to follow, and my
mother wanted me to vote for ratifica-
tion.’’
So thank you to Representative Burn
and, above all, to his mother, Ms.
Phoebe Burn, for her crucial role in
aiding women’s right to vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4024 May 21, 2019
My State, Wisconsin, was the very
first State to ratify the 19th Amend-
ment, and I am wearing this yellow
rose today in honor of the remarkable
women who fought for their seat at the
table.
They persevered; they resisted; they
persisted; and the face of Congress is
different because of them. Women like
Ida B. Wells, Susan B. Anthony, and
Sojourner Truth said that, if women
want rights, we must be sisters in arms
and fight for what is right.
Wisconsin was the first State to rat-
ify the 19th Amendment, and, unfortu-
nately, they are now leading in the ef-
forts to disenfranchise people. But it is
because of the powerful legacy that I
will continue to fight to make sure
that no one is denied access to the bal-
lots due them as citizens.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE PASSAGE AND
RATIFICATION OF THE 19TH
AMENDMENT, PROVIDING FOR
WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE, TO THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of House
Resolution 354, and I ask for its imme-
diate consideration in the House.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs.
CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York). Is
there objection to the request of the
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania?
There was no objection.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 354
Whereas Congress passed the 19th Amend-
ment to the Constitution of the United
States, guided by the shared ideals of free-
dom, sovereignty, democracy, civil liberties,
and individual rights;
Whereas from 1919 to 1920, the Sixty-Sixth
Congress debated, and State legislatures con-
sidered, an amendment to the Constitution
to provide suffrage for women;
Whereas on May 21, 1919, the House of Rep-
resentatives approved a proposed amend-
ment, followed by the Senate a few weeks
later on June 4, 1919;
Whereas the introduction, passage, and ul-
timate ratification of the 19th Amendment
were the culmination of decades of work and
struggle by advocates for the rights of
women across the United States and world-
wide;
Whereas the ratification of the 19th
Amendment ensured women could more fully
participate in our democracy and fundamen-
tally changed the role of women in the civic
life of our Nation;
Whereas August 18, 2020, marks the centen-
nial of the ratification of the 19th Amend-
ment by three-fourths of the States, pro-
viding the support necessary under article V
of the Constitution of the United States;
Whereas August 26, 2020, marks the centen-
nial of the 19th Amendment becoming a part
of the Constitution of the United States, pro-
viding for women’s suffrage; and
Whereas the centennial anniversary of the
ratification of the 19th Amendment rep-
resents a historical milestone to be lauded
and celebrated: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives—
(1) celebrates the 100th anniversary of the
passage and ratification of the 19th Amend-
ment, providing for women’s suffrage, to the
Constitution of the United States;
(2) honors the role of the ratification of the
19th Amendment in further fulfilling the
promise of the Constitution of the United
States and promoting the core values of our
democracy;
(3) reaffirms the opportunity for people in
the United States to learn about and com-
memorate the efforts of the women’s suf-
frage movement and the role of women in
our democracy; and
(4) reaffirms the desire of Congress to con-
tinue strengthening democratic participa-
tion and to inspire future generations to
cherish and preserve the historic precedent
established under the 19th Amendment.
The resolution was agreed to.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
for the purpose of debate only, I yield

ation of this resolution, all time yield-

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado?
There was no objection.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
the Rules Committee met on Monday
night and reported a rule, House Reso-
lution 389, which covers a lot of terri-
tory. It provides for consideration of
H.R. 1500, the Consumers First Act
under a structured rule which makes in
order 17 amendments.
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 1994, the Setting Every
Community Up for Retirement En-
hancement Act, or the SECURE Act,
under a closed rule which self-executes
Chairman NEAL’s manager’s amend-
ment.
Additionally, the rule provides same-
day authority and suspension author-
ity through Thursday, May 23, and it
provides filing authority for the Com-
mittee on Appropriations through 5
o’clock p.m., Sunday, June 2.
Finally, the rule provides recess in-
structions through next Friday, May
31.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1500, the Con-
sumers First Act, reverses the anti-
consumer actions taken by this admin-
istration to ensure the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau once again
serves the needs of American con-
sumers.
More than a decade ago, the United
States experienced one of the worst fi-
nancial crises in our history, caused, in
part, by a failure to have strong pro-
tections for consumers of financial
products and services.
Through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act,
Congress created the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau to be a strong
and independent agency with the man-
date to protect consumers from unfair,
deceptive, or abusive acts or practices
in the financial marketplace. When the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
was first stood up, it was a powerful
ally to consumers in middle-class fami-
lies across the country.
Under former Director Richard
Cordray, the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau returned nearly $12 bil-
lion to over 30 million consumers who
were harmed, handled over 1.2 million
consumer complaints about financial
institutions, and implemented new
safeguards to better protect consumers
who utilize a wide range of consumer
financial products and services.
Unfortunately, the Trump adminis-
tration has politicized the agency,
weakened supervision and enforce-
ment, and reduced transparency and
accountability. The Bureau has dis-
mantled protections for Active Duty
servicemembers, weakened fair lending
enforcement, blocked payday loan
cases, and terminated the Consumers
Advisory Board. These are just a few
examples of how the agency is failing
to meet its mission.
The Consumers First Act would
block the Trump Administration’s
agenda and ensure the CFPB starts
working for the people once again.
Among other things, the bill would
direct the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau leadership to reverse all
anti-consumer actions taken under this
administration, including resuming
Military Lending Act oversight. The
bill restores the supervisory and en-
forcement powers of the Office of Fair
Lending and Equal Opportunity. It also
reestablishes a dedicated student loan
office to help protect students as they
find ways to finance their education.
Importantly, the bill requires adequate
agency staffing across the Bureau, in-
cluding for supervision and enforce-
ment.
I want to thank Chairwoman WATERS
for her work on this legislation, which
I cosponsored and is supported by 51
consumer civil rights, housing, and
labor organizations.
This rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 1994, the SECURE Act. I
am also a cosponsor of this bill to
make it easier for American workers to
save for their future. One of my num-
ber-one priorities is ensuring all Colo-
radans and all Americans have the op-
portunity to find a good job, can afford
to send their kids to college, and have
something left over for their retire-
ment.
Unfortunately, nearly half of Ameri-
cans in the private sector work for an
employer who does not offer a retire-
ment plan. A 2018 study by the Na-
tional Institute on Retirement Secu-
rity found over 100 million people of
working age have few, if any, retire-
ment assets.
The SECURE Act is a bipartisan bill
which was approved unanimously by
the Ways and Means Committee, and I
am eager for the House to pass this im-
portant legislation. The SECURE Act
would make it easier for small busi-
nesses to offer retirement plans to
their employees by eliminating out-
dated barriers to the use of multiple
employer plans and improving the
quality of these providers. This could
result in hundreds of thousands of new
retirement accounts to help people
save.
Additionally, the bill would allow
long-time part-time workers to partici-
pate in 401(k) plans and create a new
tax credit to incentivize small employ-
ers to set up retirement plans for their
employees. It would also add more
flexibility for how long individuals
could contribute to their retirement
accounts, and when they must begin
drawing down on those accounts.
This legislation is a big step forward
in helping Americans save and prepare
for retirement, and I am proud to sup-
port it. I urge all of my colleagues to
support the rule and the underlying
bills, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume, and I want to thank my friend
from Colorado for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes.
It is a close-knit bunch of folks up
there on the Rules Committee, Madam
Speaker. If you have not been by re-
cently, you ought to come by. There
are only 13 of us there. It is easy to re-
member everybody’s name, but you
don’t go to the Rules Committee when
you have important bipartisan legisla-
tion to bring to the House floor. You go
to the suspension calendar for that.
You go to the Rules Committee when
you have contentious pieces of legisla-
tion to bring to the floor. I regret that
we are here today on things that are
absolutely contentious that could have
been absolutely partnership bills.
I want to reference first H.R. 1500.
That is the bill my friend from Colo-
rado spoke about as it relates to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau. He is absolutely right. The way
this Congress set up the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau when Demo-
crats were running this institution and
President Obama was in the White
House was to make it a completely ad-
ministration-driven agency with no ac-
countability to Congress whatsoever.
That was a mistake.
But the folks who set it up liked the
team that was running it at the time,
and so our efforts in the minority to
stop that from happening were
rebuffed. Now we are here today,
Madam Speaker, and you might think
that we have a list of legislative fixes
to the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau. Not so.
I encourage you to pick up a copy of
H.R. 1500 just to see what those fixes

might be. It is a 40-page bill. You have
to get to page 21 before accusations and
assertions against former Director
Mick Mulvaney end, and the important
work, like changing the way we ref-
erence the agency by name, begins.
I don’t have any language today. No
amendments were offered in the Rules
Committee last night, Madam Speaker,
to talk about all of the things that
former Director Cordray did while he
was there. The list of things that he
did that I don’t like are long. The list
of things that he did that I thought
violated the actual text of the law is
pretty long.
But he is gone, and we have the abil-
ity to fix anything we want to fix that
he did. So no amendments were offered
to impugn the integrity of the former
director. Well, not the former director,
Mr. Cordray; but the former director,
Mick Mulvaney, yes, acting director.
There are 21 pages of a 40-page bill
dedicated to personal attacks on the
former director.
Madam Speaker, if we wanted to do
something about the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau that brought its
authority out of 1600 Pennsylvania Av-
enue and right back here to where it
belongs in Article I, we would make
this agency subject to congressional
appropriations. This is a bipartisan
issue.
If you want to find something that
we agree on as an institution, let’s talk
about making Article I the lawmaker
in this country, rather than Article II.
Let’s talk about taking it out of the
White House’s hands and putting it
back into the people’s hands on Capitol
Hill. You will not find that idea in
these pages.
It is a disappointment because we
could be doing something in partner-
ship. Standing for consumers is a
shared value, not a divisive one.
I go now to the bill coming out of the
Ways and Means Committee, H.R. 1994.
Madam Speaker, as my friend from
Colorado referenced, this bill passed
unanimously out of the Ways and
Means Committee. Unanimously.
Take a look at the men and women
on the Ways and Means Committee. I
think there are 42 of them. These are
not shrinking violets on the Ways and
Means Committee. I see a couple of
them out here. I won’t call anybody
out by name—Mr. PANETTA—but they
are not shrinking violets on this com-
mittee. These are serious public policy
advocates who represent very diverse
parts of the country and who fight hard
for the values that their constituents
represent.
Unanimously, they came together as
a committee, Madam Speaker, to
change the rules for retirement, to
make it easier for families to save; to
change the rules around college savings
plans so that families who ran into
challenges in secondary years, families
whose kids develop special needs and
might not be going on to college, but
who have very real needs today, to
allow those dollars to be tapped by
those families to serve the educational
needs of their children.
Unanimously it passed the com-
mittee. In fact, I will read from the
committee report. This is not some-
thing that was done lightly in com-
mittee, Madam Speaker. We are talk-
ing about hundreds of pages of legisla-
tion, hundreds of pages of a committee
report. This was a thoughtfully de-
signed and crafted piece of legislation.
The committee said this:
The committee believes that expanding 529
plans will help families save for education
expenses that meet each family’s unique
needs.
We run into that problem often,
Madam Speaker. We try to do some-
thing that is good for America, and it
turns out that 330 million Americans
have different needs and priorities. So
the Ways and Means avoided a one-size-
fits-all solution, recognizing those
unique needs. I will read on.
The committee says:
By allowing tax-free distributions for ap-
prenticeship expenses, homeschooling ex-
penses, student loan repayments, elementary
and secondary expenses, in addition to tui-
tion, families can customize the use of their
education savings to make education more
affordable.
We didn’t read that on the headline
of any major newspaper when the Ways
and Means passed that unanimously. I
am sure there was something in the
headlines of that major newspaper
about wars in foreign lands. I am sure
there was something in the newspaper
that day about partisan politics and
how folks were poking each other with
sharp rhetorical sticks.
There was not a word about how the
men and women of the people’s House
on the Ways and Means Committee
came together unanimously, not be-
cause it wasn’t hard to craft solutions.
It is hard to craft solutions, but they
came together unanimously on con-
sensus language to move out of com-
mittee.
It sounds like I am going to tell a
story with a happy ending, Madam
Speaker, and I should be. This should
be a story about how we get things
done, but what happened last night
that you also won’t see on the front
page of the paper is, we took this con-
sensus product that was passed unani-
mously by Republicans and Democrats,
and we took it up there to the Rules
Committee.
On a straight party-line vote, we
ripped out all of the language pro-
tecting families who were trying to
help their children at home; children
who may not be getting everything
they need through the public schools
and so they get additional education at
home; families that may have opted
out of the public school system because
they couldn’t get what their children
need, and they are homeschooling their
children.
This language that was agreed upon
unanimously in a bipartisan way, was
ripped out in a party-line vote in the
Rules Committee last night. We will
never vote on it in this Chamber,
Madam Speaker.
The Ways and Means Committee in a
long committee report, long committee
language, they deliberated over this
language and concluded that the right
thing to do was to help all American
families. But somewhere between that
unanimous vote in committee and late
last night in the Rules Committee, the
decision came down from on high—and
by on high I do mean your side of the
aisle, Madam Speaker, because when
you sit in the Speaker’s chair, you
have that kind of authority. The Rules
Committee is, in fact, the Speaker’s
committee—that said we are going to
rip this language out.
We offered an amendment last night.
And I think it is only right that folks
come to sit here to watch the people’s
business. They think that we are going
to operate a transparent building here,
and we work very hard to do that.
b 1300
We offered an amendment last night
in the Rules Committee to allow a sim-
ple vote of the people’s House on this
provision. If you don’t like parents
supplementing their students’ edu-
cation at home, so be it. I don’t under-
stand it, but so be it. But let’s have a
vote on it here just like they did in the
Ways and Means Committee. On a
party-line basis, the amendment to
allow the people’s House to have a vote
on this provision was defeated.
You might not have noticed it when
the Reading Clerk was reading, Madam
Speaker. I don’t want to tell you how
long that took to read. We have a lot of
things packaged in this bill. You will
have to go all the way down to the 12th
section of the rule, and the important
words are: modified by the amendment
printed in part B of the Rules Com-
mittee report, modified by part B of
the amendment printed in the Rules
Committee report.
I will translate that for you, Madam
Speaker. That means with no vote of
this institution whatsoever and with
no consultation or input from the Ways
and Means Committee that crafted this
legislation, we are going to revoke all
benefits that would have gone to fami-
lies who cannot find the services they
need outside the home and, thus, are
paying for those services inside the
home.
Representative MITCHELL came to
the Rules Committee to testify on this
amendment last night, Madam Speak-
er. He said that his family is blessed
enough to have the financial resources
to take care of their special needs fam-
ily member. But he talked about all
the American families who he has met
in his district—the Speaker has them
in her district; the gentleman from
Colorado has them in his district; and
I have them in my district—who don’t
have the financial means and who don’t
have that sense of security.
The Ways and Means Committee in
its wisdom unanimously said let’s pro-
vide that security to American fami-
lies. The Rules Committee in an error

in judgment repealed it because six
Members voted ‘‘yes’’ last night. That
is all it took. All it took to silence an
institution of 435, Madam Speaker, was
six Members voting to include this one
seemingly innocuous line that dis-
advantages families and children all
across this Nation.
It is another missed opportunity,
Madam Speaker. We could have been

We could have been here today making

weeks since the committee has passed
it, we were doing exactly that. In about
6 minutes of voting last night, we
erased it all. It took weeks to build bi-
partisan consensus, Madam Speaker. It
took moments to erase it all.
We have choices in this institution,
Madam Speaker. We made the wrong
one in the Rules Committee last night.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to defeat this rule and give us
a chance to make a right one. But we
only get so many bites at this apple.
The trust of the American people in us
as an institution and in us as individ-
uals is not infinite. If we betray that
trust often enough, it will disappear
forever.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I will start where
my friend from Georgia just left off,
complaining about a tiny section in the
bill that was stricken in the Rules
Committee. He is correct, because
there are individuals within our Caucus
who don’t think it is appropriate. The
bill, however, has dozens of provisions
that benefit Americans of every stripe,
millions of people.
I would say to my friend from Geor-
gia, if he feels so strongly about it,
then bring it up in a motion to recom-
mit. It isn’t the last statement here. If
my friend wants to see how many peo-
ple want to vote for this, then cer-
tainly bring it up there.
Otherwise, as my friend said, this
was a major step forward on retirement
security for so many Americans. The
perfect shouldn’t be the enemy of the
good because the bill, the SECURE
Act, advances that.
Secondly, I wish Representative
MALONEY was still in the chair, Madam
Speaker, because she would recognize,
as it applies to the Consumers First
Act, that the purpose of having a single
agency focus on consumers first was so
important because we saw that by hav-
ing certain activities handled by the
Housing and Urban Development De-
partment, others handled by the Fed-
eral Reserve, and others handled by the
Federal Trade Commission, consumers
were not being protected. Much of that
failure to protect—shark practices in
the credit card industry and bad prac-
tices in the mortgage industry—led to
the recession that we faced back in
2008, 2009, and 2010.
The purpose of having an inde-
pendent agency like the CFPB was to
avoid that and put consumers first,
just as H.R. 1500 is intended to do.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from California (Mr. PA-
NETTA).
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I
thank Mr. WOODALL for his advocacy as
well as his oratory skills.
As a member of the Ways and Means
Committee, I want to talk about the
SECURE Act and obviously the work
that we did in the Ways and Means
Committee in regard to not only H.R.
1994 but, more particular, a certain
part of that bipartisan legislation that
helps home healthcare workers save for
their retirement. That would include
the over 375,000 home healthcare work-
ers in my home State of California.
Madam Speaker, we know that home
healthcare is usually less expensive. It
is more convenient and, most times,
just as effective as the care people re-
ceive in a hospital or in a skilled nurs-
ing facility.
Home healthcare workers not only
provide critical services for seniors and
those with physical, mental, or emo-
tional disabilities, but they also ensure
that our loved ones with special needs
are able to live their lives in a dig-
nified manner.
That dignity, that skill, and that
care, I can tell you, is something that
I experienced firsthand throughout my
childhood when my grandmother suf-
fered a debilitating stroke and had to
live with us. We took her in realizing
that the effects of her stroke were per-
manent. That is when my family de-
cided to ensure that she had appro-
priate home healthcare, not just the
family but with full-time home
healthcare workers.
With both my parents working full-
time, we were forced—but, yes, we were
also fortunate—to hire home
healthcare workers, people who actu-
ally came into our home, took care of
my grandmother, and allowed her to
live a life with dignity and with the
care necessary to enjoy the latter
years of her life.
However, and unfortunately, right
now under the current Federal Internal
Revenue Code, home healthcare pro-
viders like those who cared for my
grandmother are not able to partici-
pate in a retirement plan or save in an
IRA. If you are a home healthcare
worker in California who works in and
helps out families, then you would be
ineligible to participate in the
CalSavers retirement program due to
the current Federal law.
That is why this bill is so important,
because it would allow home
healthcare workers to contribute to a
defined contribution plan or IRA, giv-
ing home healthcare workers the abil-
ity to save and prepare for their own
retirement.
These healthcare workers give our
family members dignity. This is the
least that we can do for home
healthcare workers so that they can re-
tire with dignity.
That is what this bill does. That is
one of the reasons why, as a member of
the Ways and Means Committee, I did
vote for this bill. It is also why I urge
my colleagues to support the rule and
the underlying legislation.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, you heard the ear-
nestness with which Mr. PANETTA just
described the committee’s work. You
can go through every line of the com-
mittee’s work, and you are going to
find a story similar to the one that Mr.
PANETTA has told about his family that
applies to hundreds of thousands of
families across the country.
That is what this work product was.
That is what the committee spent
weeks and weeks putting together.
That is, candidly, what my constitu-
ents think we do up here every day:
find problems, find partners, craft solu-
tions, and bring them to the floor.
My friend from Colorado said that we
shouldn’t let the perfect be the enemy
of the good, and I think he is exactly
right. I haven’t voted on the perfect
bill since I have been here, Madam
Speaker. You may have had that op-
portunity; I have not. I vote on bills
that move the ball in the right direc-
tion. Even had I been king for a day, I
couldn’t have done it better.
But the flip side of ‘‘don’t let the per-
fect be the enemy of the good’’ is that
this bill passed out of the Ways and
Means Committee unanimously. It was
perfect if bipartisanship was your goal.
It is now good legislation. But with
this change, it is perfectly partisan.
I would advise my colleagues that we
spent a lot of time when we were in
control—and I had the pleasure of lead-
ing the rule, as my friend from Colo-
rado does today—protecting our Mem-
bers from tough votes. You may not
know, Madam Speaker, but the way
the Rules Committee works, we could
have offered waivers. If you wanted to
strike protections for homeschooling
families, if you wanted to strike pro-
tections from families who need to buy
more than what they can find in their
public school system for their special
needs child, you could have brought an
amendment to the floor of this House
and said: I don’t like those protections
for those families. I want to strike
them.
But then you would have had to have
stood up and said that whatever your
ax was that you were grinding that day
took priority over those families. No
Member in this institution wants to do
that, which is why it comes to the
Rules Committee as a seemingly innoc-
uous line in a committee report and
why it only takes six members to vote
‘‘yes’’ on it up there to make it a part
of the underlying bill. It pretends that
the committee voted on it when, in
fact, they did not.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4028 May 21, 2019
If we want to vote on these issues,
then let’s vote on these issues. But I
will just tell my friends here in their
fifth month of leadership that they will
begin to rue the day that they told
their new Members they could come to
Capitol Hill, be a United States
Congressperson, and not have to take
tough votes.
We began to rue that day when we
started down that road, and you only
get one chance to start again.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Responding to my good friend from
Georgia, we are going to have a chance
to vote on this in the rule, and we will
see whether or not a majority is in
favor of the changes that were made as
part of this rule package.
I would say to my friend, as part of
the changes, we are adding Gold Star
families and other children to this en-
tire SECURE Act package to benefit
them because in the race to give a $2
trillion tax cut to the richest Ameri-
cans, the Republican Party forgot
about a lot of families and a lot of chil-
dren. That is being corrected in this
bill and in this amendment.
I urge my friend to take another look
at it because this rule does benefit
Americans all across the board and all
income levels.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts
(Mrs. TRAHAN).
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise to offer my strong support for the
rule and for the Setting Every Commu-
nity Up for Retirement Enhancement
Act.
This is an important retirement sav-
ings measure that has the support of a
wide range of stakeholders, from the
United States Chamber of Commerce
to the Girl Scouts. What a credit to the
committee for taking up this impor-
tant legislation for the people.
I want to highlight section 105, a pro-
vision that the committee included to
offer a tax incentive to small busi-
nesses for setting up automatic enroll-
ment for their employees’ retirement
plans.
Madam Speaker, while half of pri-
vate-sector employees have access to a
retirement plan through their em-
ployer, it is estimated that just 15 per-
cent of small businesses offer a retire-
ment plan. Yet small businesses em-
ploy approximately half of the Nation’s
private-sector workforce.
Ensuring that small business employ-
ees have retirement options just like
those who work for larger companies
will increase small businesses’ com-
petitiveness at a time when the job
market is tightening, and it will posi-
tion these employees for a secure re-
tirement.
Establishing automatic enrollment
in retirement plans is critical. Partici-
pation rates in defined contribution
plans like a 401(k) are above 90 percent
among new hires when automatic en-
rollment is the default. Moreover, 80
percent of participants increase their
contributions over time. Alternatively,
when employers do not offer automatic
enrollment, new hire participation is
below 50 percent.
Section 105 is based upon a bill that
Mr. KELLY and I introduced, the Small
Employer Retirement Savings Auto-
Enrollment Credit Act. It would pro-
vide small businesses—those with up to
100 employees—a $500 tax credit to de-
fray the start-up cost of offering auto-
matic enrollment. The tax credit would
also be available to small businesses
that convert their existing employee
retirement program from an opt-in to
auto-enrollment.
I was pleased to work with the chair-
man and his staff as well as the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania on this
issue. I urge adoption of the resolution
and the SECURE Act.
b 1215
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I want to associate
myself with everything my friend from
Massachusetts just said. Every line of
this bill, as crafted by the Ways and
Means Committee, was designed to
make a difference in a family’s life, a
difference that every single one of us
can be proud of, and no one has a single
bit of concern about that language.
The concern is that, instead of being
down here celebrating this bipartisan
product, in the dark of night it was
converted.
My friend from Colorado is abso-
lutely right. Not only was the home-
schooling provision stripped out; a pro-
vision for Gold Star families was put
in.
Now, I will just tell you, if you have
any concerns, Madam Speaker, let me
speak on behalf of the Republican Con-
ference. If you want to stand up for
Gold Star families, I have got Members
who want to stand with you. I don’t
have some; I have them all.
To be fair, that has nothing to do
with being a Republican. If I go to the
Democratic side of the aisle and look
for folks to stand with Gold Star fami-
lies, I won’t find one; I will find them
all.
That is yet another thing that unites
us, and kudos to RICHARD NEAL, as
chairman of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, for taking an opportunity to
make the bill better in that way.
I happen to have his manager’s
amendment here, Madam Speaker.
This is the language that was taken up
by the Rules Committee last night and,
again, stuck in because only six people
voted ‘‘yes.’’ And page after page is
dealing with those Gold Star families
and trying to right that clerical error
in drafting.
It is in the middle of page 3, with
looks like seven words: ‘‘In section 302,
strike subsections (b) and (d).’’ You
might not know what section 302 is and
what sections (b) and (d) are, Madam
Speaker. I will read some of that to
you, again, from the Democratic chair-
man’s committee report, from the
unanimous legislation that was passed.
The provision allows tax-free treat-
ment to apply to distributions made
for certain additional qualifying ex-
penses on behalf of designated bene-
ficiaries attending elementary and sec-
ondary schools.
This is the offensive language that
my friend referenced that some Mem-
bers of his caucus had problems with
that needed to be taken out. Here it
comes. And I don’t mean to offend you
by reading these words, Madam Speak-
er, but I am just going to read them di-
rectly because I feel the burden to do
it.
In addition to tuition, tax-free treat-
ment would apply to a distribution
made for expenses for fees, tutoring,
special-needs services, books, supplies,
and other equipment incurred in con-
nection with the attendance of elemen-
tary school.
I am aghast. I am aghast that that is
what the Ways and Means Committee
decided to do. I am just going to tell
you again, Madam Speaker.
The committee, in its wisdom, unani-
mously decided that we should speak
up for families who have problems with
expenses for fees, academic tutoring,
special-needs services, books, supplies,
and other equipment incurred in con-
nection with their child’s attendance
in elementary school.
That is what this big to-do was about
today. If you want to have a vote on
the floor of the House that says, ‘‘I
don’t want children in elementary
school to have any help,’’ we can have
that vote. I think it would lose, and so
do my friends on the other side of the
aisle.
That is why we are not going to have
that vote. We are going to sneak it in,
in the rule, and never be able to speak
on it.
I appreciate my friend raising the
Gold Star issue because that is yet an-
other area of agreement, like the issue
my friend from Massachusetts spoke
about, like the issue my friend from
California spoke about.
Madam Speaker, when you are in the
majority in this Chamber, it is easy to
get legislation passed. You control the
Rules Committee. You control the
votes on the board. You get to jam ev-
erything through.
I know. I spent 8 years in the major-
ity, and that is the way every day is
when you are in the majority.
But you don’t have to jam everything
through. Occasionally—just occasion-
ally—there are bills, like this bill from
the Ways and Means Committee, where
every single line is dedicated to solving
problems, problems that affect your
district and problems that affect my
district.
Occasionally—just occasionally—we
find Members on both sides of the aisle
sitting down, rolling up their sleeves,
looking for solutions instead of talking

points. And, when that happens, you
produce good legislation like the bill
Chairman NEAL brought before us
today.
We could have been down here cele-
brating that legislation, Madam
Speaker. Instead, we are talking about
the efforts to unwind it. And, for the
life of me, I just don’t understand why
that is the path we have chosen.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, just in response to
my friend, we have two bills that are
encompassed in this rule: H.R. 1500, the
Consumers First Act, and H.R. 1994, the
SECURE Act.
The gentleman is focusing on one
sentence out of dozens of provisions
that benefit millions of Americans to
complain about this rule and what was
done.
Well, people get to vote on this rule.
It isn’t just 6 people or 10 people or 13
people. There will be 435 of us voting on
whether we approve the rule or not.
There are other opportunities to take
care of the one sentence, if my friend is
so aghast that it might be stricken in
favor of dozens of other provisions, in-
cluding the Gold Star family and chil-
dren across America.
So, I appreciate the rhetorical abili-
ties of my good friend from Georgia,
but, quite frankly, he is missing the
forest for the trees through all of this.
Secondly, H.R. 1500 is another key
piece of legislation that is encom-
passed in this rule to really get con-
sumers first again, as opposed to the fi-
nancial services industry being first,
which appears to be the effort of the
Trump administration.
Madam Speaker, I would inquire of
my friend from Georgia if he has any
other speakers. If not, I suggest we
close.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
don’t have any speakers remaining. I
have a powerful previous question vote
that I would like to describe, and I am
prepared to do that at this time.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
We can’t always get exercised about
every single line in every single bill.
We would never get anything done.
We have an amendment process so
that, if you get exercised about a par-
ticular line in a particular bill, you can
bring your amendment to the floor and
we vote on it.
We are going to get into the appro-
priations process soon. When we spend
money, it turns out to be one of those
issues that people feel strongly about.
We are going to entertain hundreds of
amendments—Republican amend-
ments, Democratic amendments.
Some Republican amendments are
going to pass; some are going to fail.
Some Democrat amendments are going
to pass; some are going to fail.
But we are going to work the will of
the body, and we are going to do the
best we can to get to a final package
that we move across the street to the
Senate.
My frustration in this moment,
Madam Speaker, isn’t that we have the
inability of moving things forward and
discussing ideas. We do have the ability
to do that, and we did that well in the
Ways and Means Committee.
My frustration is that, when people
don’t like the way the committee
unanimously, in a bipartisan way, did
something because they have bipar-
tisan concerns—and, to be clear, the
concerns about this language are not
Republican concerns. This language
was not stricken because Republicans
objected. This language was not strick-
en to satisfy any bipartisan concern of
any kind.
This was purely a partisan exercise.
And if you want to have a partisan ex-
ercise, I know 435 Members who are
here all day, who will come down here
to the House floor and vote on it, and
we can do that.
So I want to offer that opportunity,
Madam Speaker. For folks who think
this is about public policy, as it was
when the committee considered it in a
bipartisan way, I want to offer an
amendment to this bill.
If we defeat the previous question,
Madam Speaker, I will offer an amend-
ment that strikes this offending sec-
tion. What that means in layman’s
terms is the bill would contain the
Gold Star family language that is very
important to every Member of this
Chamber. It would contain the pension
language that is very important to
every Member of this Chamber.
It would contain every line designed
in a bipartisan fashion by the Ways and
Means Committee to make a difference
in families’ lives, but it would strike
the majority’s effort, with only six
votes on the Rules Committee, to
eliminate protections for home-school-
ing families altogether.
Vote against the previous question,
defeat the previous question, and we
can restore the bipartisan consensus
language the Ways and Means Com-
mittee crafted, and we will add the
Gold Star family language that my
friend from Colorado and I agree on.
I don’t serve in the Ways and Means
Committee, Madam Speaker. They
have got big ideas they have to work
on over there. I don’t serve on the Fi-
nancial Services Committee. They
have got big ideas they have to work
on over there.
I serve in the Rules Committee. My
job is to get bills to the House floor
and to make sure that voices are heard
on perfecting that language.
If we defeat the previous question, we
can achieve exactly the partisan goal
that the majority wants, but we can
achieve it by actually having a vote of
the House on that goal.
I think the American people are tired
of things being done in secret. I think
they are tired of things being done
without the full story being told.
I talk to my friends on the other side
of the aisle regularly, daily, hourly,
Madam Speaker. I know the hunger
from your side of the aisle to deliver on
behalf of the American people. I know
that hunger. I know the hunger on
your side of the aisle to roll up sleeves
and do the hard things. Because the
easy things somebody else has already
taken care of. All that is left for you
and me are the hard things.
Going to the well of partisanship,
pulling your sharp stick out of your
quiver and poking the other team,
those aren’t the hard things. Those are
the easy things. And, candidly, those
aren’t the surprising things. They have
become all too commonplace.
I don’t get to run this institution,
but I do get a vote in it. I see opportu-
nities for partnership, not because ev-
erybody wants it, but because it has to
happen. Republican President, Repub-
lican Senate, Democratic House: The
only way we succeed, Madam Speaker,
is to succeed together. That is the only
pathway forward.
If anybody in this Chamber ran for
their seat because they wanted to
stand up here and talk about it for 2
years, we have got a great pathway for
you. But if you ran for this seat be-
cause you actually wanted to get it
done, these bills today aren’t doing it.
The Senate won’t consider them. The
President is not going to sign them.
But there are ideas in these bills,
Madam Speaker, as expressed unani-
mously by the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, that America is hungry for and
you and I can deliver.
Let’s exceed expectations today. De-
feat the previous question, and let’s re-
store this bill to the bipartisan com-
promise that the Ways and Means Com-
mittee created.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr.
PANETTA and Mrs. TRAHAN for joining
us today to speak on this rule, the Con-
sumers First Act, and the SECURE
Act.
And, just briefly, with respect to the
Consumers First Act, there are dozens
and dozens of consumer, civil rights,
and labor organizations supporting the
Consumers First Act and how we are
approaching it pursuant to this rule:
Americans for Financial Reform, the
Center for Responsible Lending, the
Communication Workers of America,
the Consumer Federation of America,
and the NAACP, just to mention a few,
with respect to the Consumers First
Act.
With respect to the SECURE Act:

Girl Scouts, the Boy Scouts, the Na-

Owners.

So we have consumer groups, insur-
ance groups, and business groups sup-
porting the SECURE Act so that mil-
lions more Americans can feel secure
in their retirement, something that so
many people feel insecure about today.
The bill has dozens and dozens of pro-
visions. The amendment that is in the
nature of the manager’s amendment by
Mr. NEAL includes additional children,
Gold Star families, a lot of people who
were left out by the giant tax cut that
the Republicans passed a year and a
half ago to benefit the wealthiest
Americans.
These two bills are important steps
forward for the constituents that you
represent, Madam Speaker, that the
gentleman from Georgia represents,
and the people I represent.
The Consumers First Act will realign
the Consumer Bureau’s focus as a truly
independent voice protecting con-
sumers first. We have seen what the
bureau can accomplish in the millions
of consumers who were helped under
Director Cordray, and our constituents
need the bureau to continue to focus on
them.
b 1330
The SECURE Act is an important bi-
partisan package which addresses re-
tirement security and makes an impor-
tant technical change to the GOP tax
bill for Gold Star families, among oth-
ers. This package was developed by
both sides of the aisle and with many
stakeholders.
While the other side of the aisle may
be upset over one provision out of doz-
ens and dozens of provisions, I hope
they can recognize the effort that went
into this package to bring both sides
together and the millions of Americans
who are benefited by this legislation.
These are both commonsense bills,
and I look forward to their passage.
Madam Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’
vote on the rule and the previous ques-
tion.
Mr. WOODALL. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. PERLMUTTER. I yield to the
gentleman from Georgia.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that the text of
the amendment be printed in the
RECORD immediately prior to the vote
on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
JUDY CHU of California). Is there objec-
tion to the request of the gentleman
from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I kind of wanted to object, but I didn’t.
Madam Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’
vote on the rule and the previous ques-
tion.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 389
In section 2, after ‘‘accompanying this res-
olution’’ insert ‘‘and the amendment speci-
fied in section 9 of this resolution’’.
At the end, add the following new section:
SEC. 9. The amendment referred to in sec-
tion 2 of this resolution is as follows:
In the amendment printed in part B of the
report of the Committee on Rules accom-
panying this resolution, strike ‘‘In section
302, strike subsections (b) and (d).’’.
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I yield back the balance of my time,
and I move the previous question on
the resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, on

resentatives of the United States of America in

ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P.
ROE) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 2359.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, before I begin my
comments on H.R. 2359, let me ac-
knowledge the centennial year of wom-
en’s suffrage and the wonderful yellow
roses we are wearing in acknowledg-
ment of that centennial year. Happy
100th year to women’s suffrage in
America.
Madam Speaker, American
healthcare systems are grappling with
the need to redesign the delivery of
care model to better meet the needs of
veterans struggling with mental health
conditions.
Two decades of increased social isola-
tion, economic inequality, and prohibi-
tive healthcare costs have seen an in-
creased use of complementary and al-
ternative medicine such as health
coaching, chiropractic services, acu-
puncture, yoga, meditation, and equine
therapy.
The Veterans Health Administration
is one of the first healthcare systems
to redesign care with a focus on main-
taining patient well-being and early
intervention, rather than a system de-
signed to treat conditions and diseases
only after they have occurred.
This redesign, VA’s whole health
transformation, will accommodate the
veteran population and their unique
needs while empowering veterans to
control their health and well-being.
By improving well-being, veterans
build resiliency that assists in the
early intervention and identification of
mental healthcare symptoms that, left
untreated, can advance to the point of
crisis. In 2017, VA launched the whole
health transformation program at 18
flagship sites, with positive early out-
comes.
According to a February 2019 memo
on VA’s whole health transformation,
VA plans to expand the full program to
an additional 18 sites by summer 2019,
and 140 medical centers have elements
of this program.
The pace, efficacy, and reach of the
whole health program are not known
to Congress. H.R. 2359, as amended, of-
fered by Congressman LAMB, requires
the delivery of a report on VA’s whole
health transformation. It will contain
an analysis of the accessibility of crit-
ical services so that Congress can bet-
ter inform its efforts to ensure vet-
erans are treated as whole people and
not just episodes of care. This is par-
ticularly true for socially isolated vet-
erans and veterans living far away
from a VA facility.
A two-pronged strategy is needed to
effectively address the veteran suicide
public health crisis. The second prong
is treating those veterans in crisis and
making treatment more accessible.
The first prong must address the com-
plex set of social determinants that
can lead to a crisis.
Early interventions in mental
healthcare can prevent veterans from
falling into crisis and having suicidal
ideations. This legislation falls under
the first prong of the strategy, which
will support creating opportunities for
early, pre-crisis intervention.
Congress must understand how VA
has rolled out the initial expansion
outcomes and the resources needed to
continue the whole health program.
This body must do everything in its
power to reduce the number of veteran
suicides in this country because this is
a sustained, prolonged, and frustrating
national public health crisis.
Sadly, over the weekend, yet another
veteran died by suicide at a VA Hos-
pital.
This bill is the first of five measures
we will consider today to address men-
tal healthcare and suicide prevention
efforts at VA. Our work, however, does
not end today. We will write more leg-
islation. We will hold more bipartisan
hearings.
In fact, a hearing right this very mo-
ment, this afternoon, with the Armed
Services Subcommittee on Military
Personnel and our Health Sub-
committee brought VA and DOD to the
same table to help end this crisis. It is
a joint hearing through this joint sub-
committee between the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee and the Armed Serv-
ices Committee.
We will do whatever it takes to end
these tragic incidents of suicide. I am
fully committed to this effort. Losing
20 veterans a day is unacceptable.
I will be voting ‘‘yes’’ on this critical
piece of legislation, and I call on every
Member of this body to do the same
and help reduce veteran suicide.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself as
much time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I would like to asso-
ciate my comments with the chair-
man’s comments about women’s suf-
frage 100th anniversary today.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2359, as amended, the

May 21, 2019
Whole Veteran Act. This bill would re-
quire the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs to submit a report to Congress on
the implementation of the whole
health initiative and include informa-
tion in the report about the avail-
ability of a number of complementary
and alternative treatments like medi-
tation, acupuncture, yoga, and equine
therapy.
VA’s whole health initiative is a
component of Secretary Wilkie’s plan
to transform the Veterans Health Ad-
ministration into a more innovative,
holistic, and veteran-centric
healthcare system that puts veteran
patients in the driver’s seat.
I support the Secretary in that effort
wholeheartedly, and I look forward to
seeing how it will yield improved out-
comes and satisfaction among veterans
across the country.
The dissemination of best practices
and complementary and alternative ap-
proaches to pain management is par-
ticularly important, given the ongoing
opioid crisis that continues to plague
our Nation.
I thank Congressman CONOR LAMB
from Pennsylvania for sponsoring this
bill and Congressman BARR from Ken-
tucky for improving it with his tireless
advocacy for equine therapy. I encour-
age all Members to join me in sup-
porting it.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB), my good
friend, the vice chairman of the House
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and
the author of H.R. 2359.
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of the Whole Veteran
Act. I thank the chairman of the Vet-
erans Affairs’ Committee, Mr. TAKANO,
and the ranking member, Dr. ROE, for
their support for this act, along with
all members of our committee.
This is a bipartisan bill with a bipar-
tisan goal, which simply is to reform
and continue to improve VA
healthcare. Our bill will do that in two
very important ways.
First, we aim to make the VA a lead-
er in the future of healthcare. Many
doctors have looked at how America’s
healthcare system is too expensive and
too reliant on prescription drugs. It
turns out that not all doctors think
that the best way to deal with chronic
pain, PTSD, or depression is to simply
hand out more pills.
b 1530
In fact, we believe that the future of
healthcare is going to involve a mix of
old and new methods of treatment.
In the future, patients who are suf-
fering will get access to yoga, acupunc-
ture, or meditation before they are
ever exposed to these addictive drugs.
This is safer and it is also cheaper, and
we believe that, in the long-run, it is
going to be better.
The NIH, which is the government’s
gold standard when it comes to re-
search, has looked at these treatments
and found that yoga is effective for
back pain, that acupuncture is highly
effective for chronic conditions like os-
teoarthritis, and study after study has
documented the benefits of meditation
and healthy eating when it comes to
anxiety, when it comes to stress, when
it comes to chronic pain and all of the
drivers of the suicide crisis that we are
seeing today. In the right combination,
these treatments will allow us all to
spend less on healthcare and to feel
better in the future.
But perhaps, Madam Speaker, the
most important part of our bill is that
it gives veterans more real choices and
greater power to manage their own
healthcare.
I visited a Whole Health Clinic here
in Washington, D.C., and the veterans
who were partaking in that clinic, they
like it because they get to pick which
treatments work well for them based
on how it makes them feel. They pick
the teachers they like and they go to
the classes, where they meet other vet-
erans who they get to know and spend
time with, and it keeps them coming
back.
One of the greatest challenges is how
we keep people coming back to the VA
for treatment once they have got it.
To stop veteran suicide once and for
all, one of the most important things
we have to do is go out and get all the
veterans who are living in isolation
and not using the VA for care.
Thirteen of the 20 veterans who are
committing suicide every day are out-
side of the VA’s reach. We have got to
find them, and we have got to give
them a reason to come back. This is
what the whole health program does. It
gives our veterans a reason to come
back and stay in the VA that they
didn’t have before.
We don’t know right now which parts
of the whole health program work the
best and which ones still need more
work. Our bill will start to answer that
question. But we do know one thing,
which is that there is no time to lose.
Veterans serve this country because
they want to prevent the suffering of
others, and now too many of them are
suffering themselves. We owe it to
them to try anything that will work.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I have no further
speakers at this time. I am prepared to
close. I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. RYAN), my good friend and
cosponsor of H.R. 2359.
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I thank
the chair for yielding. I thank Con-
gressman LAMB for his leadership on
this bill. I thank Congressman ROE for
his leadership on this. I want to also
thank Chairwoman DEBBIE WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ on our appropriations bill. We
continue to invest into the whole vet-
eran.
I think it has been articulated here
that we want the VA system to be the
most innovative system that we have,
and I believe that the Whole Veteran
Act is a step in that direction.
I have been researching and writing
about some of these integrative health
techniques around meditation, around
yoga, around nutrition, around having
health coaches, and to watch these vets
transform after years and years and
years of suffering is the most touching,
the most inspirational thing we can do.
I have been in yoga classes where the
teacher is a vet who, just years before,
was kicking down doors in Iraq. Double
amputee, and he is teaching yoga to
veterans, and they are healing from
post-traumatic stress.
This, to me, is what the government
is all about. How do we get these gov-
ernment programs, these government
facilities on the cutting edge, not just
in healthcare, but all across the board?
That is what this act is doing. It is
going to save us money.
The default position for vets should
not be how many prescription drugs
can we get them on.
This is going to save us money. This
is getting these vets their lives back.
This is reconnecting them to their fam-
ilies, to their kids, to their spouses, to
their communities. This is the most in-
spirational thing happening in govern-
ment today.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank
Tracy Gaudet, who is leading patient-
centered care in the VA. She has been
plugging away at this for years. This is
a step in the right direction.
Madam Speaker, I can’t thank the
chairman enough. I hope we continue
to go down this road.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentleman an additional 30
seconds.
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I know
the Secretary of the VA. We have dis-
agreements with him, but he, himself,
has testified before our committee
talking about these programs and
about the importance of these pro-
grams.
If you want to be inspired, go sit in a
meditation class with a Vietnam vet
who has been traumatized for years
and listen to them tell you about how
these practices have healed them and
have fixed their problems and recon-
nected them back to their families.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank ev-
erybody for their leadership on this,
and we will continue to try to support
it from the appropriations side.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such
time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I, too, want to en-
courage all Members to support this.
We, in 2003, spent about $2 billion on
mental health and PTSD treatment at
the VA; in this year’s budget, it is $8.5
billion. And we have not moved the
needle at all on the number of veterans
committing suicide.
So I think this is a great idea to see
if we can use an alternative treatment
to help lower this way-too-high rate
and help.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
TAKANO) that the House suspend the

VET CENTER ELIGIBILITY
EXPANSION ACT
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and pass the
bill (H.R. 1812) to amend title 38,
United States Code, to furnish Vet Cen-
ter readjustment counseling and re-
lated mental health services to certain
individuals, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1812
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Vet Center Eli-
gibility Expansion Act’’.
SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF VET CENTER SERVICES.
Section 1712A of title 38, United States Code,
is amended—
(1) by striking ‘‘clauses (i) through (iv)’’ both
places it appears and inserting ‘‘clauses (i)
through (vi)’’;
(2) by striking ‘‘in clause (v)’’ both places it
appears and inserting ‘‘in clause (vii)’’;
(3) in subsection (a)(1)(C)—
(A) by redesignating clauses (iv) and (v) as
clauses (vi) and (vii), respectively; and
(B) by inserting after clause (iii) the following
new clauses:
‘‘(iv) Any individual who is a veteran or mem-
ber of the Armed Forces, including a member of
a reserve component of the Armed Forces, who
served—
‘‘(I) on active service in response to a national
emergency or major disaster declared by the
President; or
‘‘(II) in the National Guard of a State under
orders of the chief executive of that State in re-
sponse to a disaster or civil disorder in such
State.
‘‘(v) Any individual who participated in a
drug interdiction operation as a member of the
Coast Guard, regardless of the location of that
operation.’’; and
(4) in subsection (h), by adding at the end the
following new paragraphs:
‘‘(4) The term ‘active service’ has the meaning
given that term in section 101 of title 10.
‘‘(5) The term ‘civil disorder’ has the meaning
given that term in section 232 of title 18.’’.
SEC. 3. PLAN TO PROVIDE VET CENTER SERVICES
TO VETERANS LIVING IN AREAS
WHERE NO VET CENTER IS LOCATED.
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit
to the Committees on Veterans’ Affairs of the
Senate and House of Representatives a plan to
provide Vet Center services to veterans living in
geographic areas where no Vet Center is lo-
cated, including in the United States insular
areas.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P.
ROE) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 1812.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Madam Speaker, the VA is author-
ized to provide counseling through Vet
Centers to a broad group of veterans
and servicemembers. These veterans
and servicemembers include National
Guard and Reserve members, those who
have served on Active Duty in any
combat theater or area of hostility,
veterans and servicemembers who ex-
perienced military sexual trauma,
those who provided direct emergent
medical care or mortuary services to
casualties of war, or servicemembers
and veterans who deployed to combat
zones or areas of hostility in a direct
support role.
However, members of the National
Guard, Reserve, or Coast Guard who
participated in a drug interdiction or
who served in a response to a national
emergency, major disaster, or civil dis-
order are currently not eligible to re-
ceive Vet Center care. This is all de-
spite the effects such experiences can
have on mental health.
H.R. 1812, as amended, the Vet Center
Eligibility Expansion Act, introduced
by Ranking Member ROE, would cor-
rect this oversight by extending eligi-
bility for Vet Center care to these indi-
viduals.
It would also require the VA to sub-
mit a plan to Congress for providing
Vet Center services to geographical
areas in which no Vet Centers are lo-
cated. These areas include territories
of the United States, rural, and insular
areas.
By assessing the steps necessary to
provide access to Vet Centers for vet-
erans living in these underserved areas,
the Vet Center Eligibility Expansion
Act is ensuring veterans, servicemem-
bers, reservists, and members of the
Coast Guard and National Guard are
allowed access to the lifesaving serv-
ices Vet Centers provide.
This legislation increases access to
services that provide early interven-
tion for mental healthcare issues,
which can reduce the risks associated
with suicide.
The sad statistics show that, of the 20
veterans and military servicemembers
who die by suicide, 14 of those 20 have
not received VA healthcare. This bill is
one step towards changing this tragic
number.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my
colleague, Dr. ROE, for his work on this
important measure, and I call upon all
of our colleagues to join us in voting
‘‘yes’’ on this life-changing piece of
legislation.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such
time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 1812, as amended,
the Vet Center Eligibility Expansion
Act.
Every day, 20 of those who have worn
our Nation’s uniform die by suicide. Of
those 20 deaths, each one is a tragedy.
There are approximately four deaths
among Active-Duty servicemembers
and nonactivated members of the Na-
tional Guard and Reserve.
The number of suicides among never
federally activated members of the Na-
tional Guard and Reserve, in par-
ticular, has increased from 2005 to 2016,
according to the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs’ most recent suicide data.
Many of these men and women have
stepped up to serve their communities
and our country honorably in dan-
gerous and unpredictable situations.
That service can have an understand-
able impact on mental health, but be-
cause they may not meet the legal defi-
nition of a veteran due to the nature of
their service, these individuals may
not be eligible for care from the VA.
This bill would address that issue by
expanding eligibility for counseling
and care at VA Vet Centers to those in
the Reserve, National Guard, or Coast
Guard who served in response to emer-
gency situations in the wake of a dis-
aster or civil disorder or support of
drug interdiction operations who never
deployed.
VA’s 300 Vet Centers are community-
based facilities that provide readjust-
ment counseling services to Active-
Duty servicemembers, veterans, and
their families.
Vet Center employees, many of whom
are veterans themselves, are on the
forefront of the fight to prevent suicide
among servicemembers and veterans,
to assure their successful transition
following the military, and to assist
them in recovering from whatever
trauma or challenges they may be fac-
ing.
I am proud to sponsor this bill and
grateful to Congressman MIKE LEVIN
from California for joining me as an
original cosponsor.
I am also grateful to the Enlisted As-
sociation of the National Guard of the
United States and the Iraq and Afghan-
istan Veterans of America for their
support of this legislation.
It is my sincere hope that this bill
will allow all of those who served in
the National Guard, the Coast Guard,
or the Reserve component to get the

help they need and lower the number of
suicides among this population of he-
roes.
Madam Speaker, before reserving, I
do want to note my surprise that the
bill received a discretionary score of
$55 million over 5 years from the Con-
gressional Budget Office.
It appears that CBO estimated that
VA would need to create costly new ca-
pacity within the Vet Centers to care
for those individuals newly eligible in
this bill.
Madam Speaker, I have been to many
Vet Centers, and the brick and mortar
is already there. You don’t have to do
anything. The personnel are there. So
there would be, if any, minimal costs.
However, I understand from VA that
excess capacity exists within the Vet
Centers that this bill would help fill, at
little additional cost to the Depart-
ment. I hope that could be taken into
account for this bill, moving forward.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all
Members to support this bill today, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
b 1545
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
California (Mr. LEVIN), my good friend
and fellow Californian, the chairman of
the Economic Opportunity Sub-
committee, and also a cosponsor of
H.R. 1812.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.
1812, the Vet Center Eligibility Expan-
sion Act.
Madam Speaker, I was proud to in-
troduce this bipartisan legislation with
my friend from Tennessee and ranking
member of the House Veterans’ Affairs
Committee, Dr. ROE.
We must do more to address the epi-
demic of suicide among veterans in
this country. We can start with ensur-
ing all servicemembers have the men-
tal health support they need.
Currently, most National Guard,
Coast Guard, and Reserve servicemem-
bers are precluded from receiving read-
justment counseling services at vet
centers. Guardsmen and Reservists
often face emotionally challenging de-
ployments to natural disasters, drug
interdiction missions, national emer-
gencies, or civil disorders that can
have serious mental health con-
sequences.
This bipartisan legislation is an im-
portant step in closing the mental
healthcare gap for those servicemem-
bers who compose four of the 20 vet-
eran suicides we see each day in this
country. As we continue to see vet-
erans turn to suicide, often on the
grounds of VA facilities, we must have
an all-hands-on-deck approach, and
this bill can play a critical role in this
effort.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such
time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all
Members to support this. I think it is a
great step forward for our Guard and
Reservists.
I will just pass along a quick story of
one of the reasons why I have pushed
this so hard. In my Tennessee Guard at
home, my previous commander said
that in the first 45 days he commanded
the Tennessee Guard, he had four sui-
cides. He knew he had to do something,
so he instituted a program there to
help lower veteran suicides.
We have lowered our suicide rate
among our Tennessee guardsmen by 70
percent. We would like to make sure
that all Guard and Reservists have ac-
cess to the benefits they need, the ther-
apy they need, and the help they need
for their families by allowing them to
get this help at the vet center.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all
Members to support this, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
urge all of my colleagues in the House
to support H.R. 1812, as amended, so we
can finally pass it into law and get jus-
tice for these veterans.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
TAKANO) that the House suspend the

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2326.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H.R. 2326, as amended, the Navy SEAL
Chief Petty Officer William ‘‘Bill’’
Mulder (Ret.) Transition Improvement
Act of 2019.
I would like to recognize the Eco-
nomic Opportunity Subcommittee
chairman and ranking member, Mr.
LEVIN and Mr. BILIRAKIS, for their bi-
partisan focus on this issue, and the bi-
partisan way in which they have craft-
ed this piece of legislation and have
moved it forward.
Almost 30 years ago, the National
Defense Authorization Act created the
first transition policy to assist service-
members entering civilian life. This
law provides that those who are being
separated from Active Duty are pro-
vided services for counseling, training
opportunities, finding employment,
and other related information and serv-
ices.
These services, more commonly
known as the Transition Assistance
Program, or TAP, were amended re-
cently by the VOW to Hire Heroes Act
of 2011. This legislation called for man-
datory participation of all servicemem-
bers and improved transition resources
by lengthening the process and low-
ering the class sizes.
While our veterans have found the
TAP program to be highly beneficial,
they find the sheer amount of informa-
tion too overwhelming to absorb.
Today, I ask my colleagues to support
H.R. 2326, as amended, which aims to
solve this problem.
This legislation would do several
things to make TAP more effective.
First, this act would create a pilot
program offering transition training
off military bases, making the transi-
tion process easier to access for vet-
erans and spouses. A review by the
Government Accountability Office con-
cluded that a program held off base
would be beneficial, and the committee
believes that such a program is worth
examining in further detail.
In my own visits to TAP classes, I
heard from servicemembers who felt
they needed to attend TAP multiple
times before they transition to civilian
life because the resources aren’t avail-
able off base. The legislation would
create a grant program for organiza-
tions to provide multiple transition as-
sistance services such as resume assist-
ance, interview training, and job re-
cruitment training from one program,
location, and source.
Next, this act would give the Depart-
ment of Labor’s Veterans’ Employment
and Training Service and VA access to
the Social Security Administration’s
resources to track in real time when a
participant receives a new job. This is
going to help improve programs and
provide a better accountability of serv-
ices provided by the VA.
Lastly, this bill would require a 1-
year independent assessment of the ef-
fectiveness of TAP, as well as a 5-year
longitudinal study of TAP which com-
pares the effectiveness of using the pro-
gram.
The 1-year independent assessment of
the Transition Assistance Program’s
effectiveness shall be conducted not
later than 90 days after the enactment
of this act. The legislation requires the
VA enter into an agreement with an
entity with experience in adult edu-
cation to carry out an independent as-
sessment of TAP.
It also requires the Secretary of
Labor, Secretary of Veterans Affairs,
and the Small Business Administration
to conduct a 5-year longitudinal study
of TAP to determine the need for TAP
off base and determine if this program

would ease the process of participation
for servicemembers, veterans, and
spouses who may have had difficulty
attending classes on bases.
Upon completion of the respective 1-
year and 5-year studies, the Secretary
of the VA shall submit the findings to
Congress, where we can, again, assess
the quality of transition resources pro-
vided to veterans and servicemembers.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such
time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2326, as amended, the Navy
SEAL Chief Petty Officer William
‘‘Bill’’ Mulder (Ret.) Transition Im-
provement Act of 2019.
One of the most important things our
government can do to help our Nation’s
servicemembers is to ensure that their
transition from military to civilian life
is as seamless as possible. We all know
that an ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure, and I believe that so
many of the problems that veterans en-
counter later in life could have been
mitigated if they had a more sup-
portive and successful transition. I
know that the goal of this bill is to
help servicemembers have as smooth a
transition as possible to civilian life.
I will allow Congressman JODEY
ARRINGTON from Texas, who is an origi-
nal cosponsor of the bill, to go into the
specifics in a moment. Before I do that,
I want to thank him, as the former
chairman of the Subcommittee on Eco-
nomic Opportunity, for taking the time
last Congress to sit down with stake-
holders and really examine the transi-
tion process from the very beginning
and look at the need for improvements.
While this bill was a culmination of a
bipartisan review and work, it is only
one step in the process to ensure a suc-
cessful transition for all servicemem-
bers. I know that we all remain dedi-
cated to making improvements to this
process to reach this goal. We were un-
able to persuade the Senate to act on
this bill last Congress, and I want to
thank Mr. ARRINGTON, Chairman
TAKANO, and subcommittee Chairman
LEVIN for picking up where we left off
in pushing this bill through yet again.
I am confident, with their continued
support, we can ensure it is on Presi-
dent Trump’s desk very soon.
Madam Speaker, I want to just say
from a point of privilege, when I sepa-
rated from the military, the U.S. Army
in 1974, a long time ago, my transition:
Was how quick can I get to the front
gate? We have made huge improve-
ments since the end of the Vietnam
war. There really was no program for
veterans then. It was a mistake then. I
appreciate the efforts of my colleague
to rectify this mistake.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all
Members to support H.R. 2326, as
amended, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
California (Mr. LEVIN), my good friend,
the chairman of the Economic Oppor-
tunity Subcommittee, and also the au-
thor of H.R. 2326.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.
2326, the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Offi-
cer William ‘‘Bill’’ Mulder (Ret.) Tran-
sition Improvement Act of 2019.
Madam Speaker, I was proud to in-
troduce this bipartisan legislation with
my friend from Texas, Mr. JODEY
ARRINGTON. Mr. ARRINGTON was a
friend of Mr. Mulder and represents his
hometown of Plainview, Texas.
William Mulder, or Bill as his friends
knew him, passed away nearly 2 years
ago on June 9, 2017. He was a decorated
Navy SEAL of 20 years whose awards
included three Bronze Stars with
Valor. He was also a father, husband,
brother, and friend.
This legislation honors him by better
equipping servicemembers for the chal-
lenges and opportunities they will face
as they transition from Active Duty
military service to civilian life. Far
too often, the men and women of our
Armed Forces lack the support and co-
ordinated resources they need to re-
turn to civilian life and we cannot
leave them behind. We owe it to those
who have served and their families to
ensure that they have everything they
need to connect with community orga-
nizations, to pursue educational oppor-
tunities, to launch new careers, or to
start their own businesses. That is why
we must improve the Transition As-
sistance Program.
This bill would extend a pilot pro-
gram for off-base transition training,
allowing veterans and their spouses
more time and convenience to digest
and access resources.
It would also create a grant program
for organizations to provide multiple
transition assistance services such as
resume assistance, interview training,
and job recruitment training from a
central source.
We can also improve the program by
expanding access to better employment
data at the Departments of Labor and
Veterans Affairs, which this bill does.
And, finally, it is important that we
are constantly evaluating the effec-
tiveness of the Transition Assistance
Program, which is why this bill would
require a 1-year independent assess-
ment and a 5-year study of the pro-
gram.
b 1600
We have a solemn duty to ensure
that our Nation’s heroes are able to
readily access the best possible serv-
ices when it comes time to transition
back to civilian life.
I do not believe that we are living up
to that duty right now, but this bipar-
tisan bill will help change that. I
strongly encourage my colleagues to
vote in support today.
Madam Speaker, again, I thank the
gentleman from Texas (Mr.
ARRINGTON), my friend, and our origi-
nal cosponsors: Mr. CISNEROS; ranking
member of the Economic Opportunity
Subcommittee, Mr. BILIRAKIS; Mr.
CUNNINGHAM; and Mrs. LEE.
Together, we can do more than pay
lip service to our veterans. We can give
them the support and the resources
they have earned and deserve.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS), my good friend.
This is my sixth term in Congress,
and I have served each one with GUS. I
can assure you, there is nobody in this
body, of the 435 of us, who is more sup-
portive of our Nation’s veterans than
GUS BILIRAKIS of Florida 12.
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I
rise in strong support of H.R. 2326, the
Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer Wil-
liam ‘‘Bill’’ Mulder (Ret.) Transition
Improvement Act of 2019.
As ranking member of the Economic
Opportunity Subcommittee, I am proud
of the work we have done in the sub-
committee so far this year on a bipar-
tisan basis and through regular order.
Last Congress, we worked together to
make reforms to the Transition Assist-
ance Program at the Department of
Defense, enacting a portion of this bill
in the National Defense Authorization
Act. We created a more individualized
process for servicemembers to undergo
counseling and training for civilian life
well before their discharge. I think
that is the key.
The bill was formed as a result of
multiple roundtables and hearings,
which included stakeholders from my
district who discussed the importance
of community involvement in their
transition process and stakeholders
from all over the country, Madam
Speaker. And yet, despite all the
progress we have made, there is still
more work to be done. I am grateful
that we are revisiting this issue today.
H.R. 2326 will provide access to vet-
eran employment tracking information
to the VA and to the Department of
Labor. It will also reestablish a pilot
program for an off-base TAP program
for veterans and their spouses, made
available at locations such as local
high schools and community centers.
Madam Speaker, I think it is so impor-
tant to include the spouses.
H.R. 2326 would also create a 5-year
grant program at the VA for qualified
community organizations that provide
innovative transition assistance serv-
ices to veterans.
I know we have many of these orga-
nizations in my district in Florida and
all over the country. One example of
this is Veterans Alternative in Holi-
day, Florida. I am grateful for the
great work that they do.
Finally, this bill would require the
VA, DOD, DOL, and SBA to coordinate
their efforts to conduct a 2-year inde-
pendent assessment and curriculum re-
view of TAP and the transition process,
as well as a 5-year longitudinal study
on the effectiveness of these TAP
changes.
I am glad to see the bill being taken
up today by my friend and the sub-
committee chairman, MIKE LEVIN,

whom I have gotten the pleasure to
know this year.
I think I don’t have much more time,
but I want to give him so much credit
for doing a great job as chairman of the
Economic Opportunity Committee, as
well as Chairman TAKANO and my good
friend, Republican Ranking Member
ROE. I also commend Representative
ARRINGTON for doing a great job. We
are helping our veterans.
Let’s pass this good bill and get it to
the Senate and to the President so it
can become law.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM), my
good friend and member of the Eco-
nomic Opportunity Subcommittee and
cosponsor of H.R. 2326.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker,
today, I rise in support of H.R. 2326, the
Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer Wil-
liam ‘‘Bill’’ Mulder (Ret.) Transition
Improvement Act.
First, I thank my colleagues, Con-
gressmen LEVIN and BILIRAKIS, for all
their hard work on this bipartisan bill
and for their leadership on the Sub-
committee on Economic Opportunity.
I am honored to have helped intro-
duce this important legislation, which
will improve the military’s Transition
Assistance Program and help to ensure
that our men and women in uniform
can successfully transition to life in
the civilian world at the end of their
service.
H.R. 2326 will streamline the transi-
tion process and allow the VA to part-
ner with third-party organizations that
teach veterans critical job-seeking
skills. By creating a pilot program for
transition training off-base, this bill
will also make that stressful transition
process more convenient and accessible
for servicemembers and their families.
Finally, this legislation will allow
policymakers to more effectively ad-
just the program to the needs of our
veterans by directing an independent
assessment of its effectiveness and by
expanding the VA’s access to Federal
employment data.
The bottom line is, we have a respon-
sibility to our servicemembers to make
sure that they are equipped with the
tools to succeed both on the battlefield
and when they return.
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
join me in supporting this legislation
and ensuring every veteran has access
to the support that they have earned.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to
the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
ARRINGTON), my good friend who was a
previous chairman of the Economic Op-
portunity Subcommittee on the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, and have
him tell you about this bill because
this was his friend.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker,
what a joy and a pleasure and an honor
to serve under the ranking member’s
leadership in the 115th Congress, my
first term. I thank him for letting me
lead the subcommittee and initiate the
legislation that will have an impact—I
believe a tremendous impact—on the
lives of folks like my friend Bill, so I
thank him.
Madam Speaker, I enjoyed working
with Chairman TAKANO, and I con-
gratulate him on his chairmanship. I
thank him for being a great colleague
and for being a friend to the veterans,
most importantly.
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman
LEVIN for being such a gracious gen-
tleman and statesman, to come up to
me on the floor of the House and tell
me he was going to pick up this ball
and he was going to run it all the way
down the field and into the end zone so
that we can score points, not politi-
cally for Democrats or Republicans,
but for the American people who ex-
pect that we take care of our veterans
and, most of all, for our military men
and women who are transitioning and
have unique challenges in that regard,
as Bill had. It meant so much to me.
If I don’t say anything else here, I
want to say thank you. I say that on
behalf of Bill’s family because I know
it means a lot to them.
He is worthy. Bill Mulder is worthy
to be on this legislation. Don’t ask me,
ask his teammates, his fellow Navy
SEALs.
I mean, just look at him. He is Cap-
tain America. I am so jealous. I was al-
ways jealous. He was tough. He was
strong. He was courageous.
Madam Speaker, I promise you this,
that when he stood between you and
me and the enemy, we were safe, and
the enemy was scared, as they should
be.
Thank God for Bill Mulder, and
thank God for our men and women who
wear the uniform.
Our country makes a tremendous in-
vestment in preparing our citizen sol-
diers to be freedom fighters, to be part
of the greatest fighting force in all the
world, but then we invest a fraction of
that in their transition back to civilian
life.
This is an investment in prevention,
as has been said. If we can do a better
job on the front end, then we can pre-
vent folks from struggling with addic-
tion, unemployment, homelessness,
suicide, and a number of challenges
that disproportionately affect our vet-
erans.
Next Monday, we will celebrate Me-
morial Day and take time to pay trib-
ute to those who not only served but
made the ultimate sacrifice, those
American heroes who never made it
home.
However, even when our soldiers do
return home from war, it doesn’t al-
ways mean that the conflict is over for
them. There is often a battle that con-
tinues to rage on. It is a big reason
that we see so many soldiers take their
own lives.
One of those veterans, sadly enough,
was my friend Bill, my fellow Plain-
view Bulldog for whom this bill was
named. I am so proud that this legisla-
tion bears his name, and I am so grate-
ful that you guys kept it that way.
Bill was a warrior’s warrior. He
served this country with honor and dis-
tinction.
Like many veterans, Bill’s greatest
fight wasn’t on the battlefield. It was
the struggle that often ensues from the
mental, emotional, and physical wear
and tear of military service.
After 20 years as a combat Navy
SEAL, Bill bore scars you couldn’t see,
and he struggled to make that transi-
tion from Active Duty to civilian life.
For a lot of these folks, it is not the
skills gap that is important. It is not
always the education gap. It is not
even redefining your mission and pur-
pose after such a sacred calling as to
wear the United States uniform. Some-
times, it is a mental health issue.
I am grateful that we have included
that in that comprehensive assessment
and in this legislation because that was
the case for Mr. Mulder.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1
minute to the gentleman from Texas.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I
am sorry for going on a little long.
Let me just say, we owe this to the
likes of Bill Mulder.
I really believe, Ranking Member,
Chairman TAKANO, and Chairman
LEVIN, of all the things I worked on, on
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee—and
it was a tremendous honor; I didn’t
serve our country in the military, so
this was my way of serving those who
served—I don’t believe anything is
going to have a greater impact. And it
may just save lives. I believe it will. I
really do.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to be a
small part of it. God bless our veterans.
God bless those guardian angels that
keep guard over us every day. God
bless the United States of America.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I have no further
speakers. I am prepared to close, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, let
me say that I extend my commenda-
tions to the work of my colleague from
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). I thank him
also for naming the bill after such a
distinguished warrior and someone who
exemplifies the need for this legisla-
tion. We certainly wish Chief Petty Of-
ficer Navy SEAL Bill Mulder all the
success in the world.
Madam Speaker, I have no further
speakers, and I am prepared to close, so
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I think it is appro-
priate, as we approach this Memorial
Day, as many families go on picnics, to
remember what it means. We not only
memorialize those whom we lost in
combat, but I think we also memori-
alize those who are lost because of the
invisible wounds of combat.
I can’t think of a more fitting time
to pass this bill for Navy SEAL Chief

SUPPORT FOR SUICIDE

troller General of the United States to
conduct an assessment of the respon-
sibilities, workload, and vacancy rates
of Department of Veterans Affairs sui-
cide prevention coordinators, and for
other purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Support for
Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act’’.

OF RESPONSIBILITIES, WORKLOAD,

MENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SUI-
CIDE PREVENTION COORDINATORS.
(a) ASSESSMENT REQUIRED.—The Comp-
troller General of the United States shall
conduct an assessment of the responsibil-
ities, workload, training, and vacancy rates
of Department of Veterans Affairs suicide
prevention coordinators. Such assessment
shall include a determination of—
(1) the extent to which the use and staffing
of suicide prevention coordinators varies be-
tween Department facilities; and
(2) the extent to which the Secretary pro-
vides oversight of suicide prevention coordi-
nators.

one year after the date of the enactment of
this Act, the Comptroller General shall sub-
mit to the Committees on Veterans’ Affairs
of the Senate and House of Representatives a
report containing the findings of the assess-
ment required by subsection (a).

ant to the rule, the gentleman from

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 2333.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, according to the Na-
tional Suicide Data Report for 2005–
2016, approximately 20 veterans, Active
Duty servicemembers, and members of
the National Guard and Reserves die by
suicide each day.
This rate is disproportionately high-
er than that of the civilian population.
Of those 20 a day, 14 are not enrolled in
the VA healthcare system. Part of the
VA’s effort to combat veteran suicide
is by strengthening the role of the sui-
cide prevention coordinator. The VA is
the only healthcare system that has
full-time employees dedicated to sui-
cide prevention.
Suicide prevention coordinators iden-
tify high-risk veterans and ensure they
receive appropriate care, conduct out-
reach, and promote awareness and best
practices within the VA system. As of
April 2019, the VA had approximately
444 suicide prevention coordinators sta-
tioned at medical centers across the
country.
These coordinators manage care for
almost 30,000 veterans who are high
risk for suicide, in addition to man-
aging their other duties as assigned.
In fiscal year 2018, these coordinators
conducted more than 20,000 outreach
events, reaching almost 2 million peo-
ple. During the oversight trips to VA
facilities, VA committee staff heard
from coordinators who are overworked
and struggled to keep up with their
casework.
Last week, I visited the Atlanta VA
Medical Center and one of three Vet-
erans Crisis Line call centers. Last
year, the Atlanta VA crisis line re-
ceived 3,600 referrals. The Atlanta sui-
cide prevention team is staffed with
only eight social workers and one em-
ployee for administrative support to
respond to all crisis line referrals and
approximately 200 veterans identified
as high risk for suicide.
Let me repeat that. They have eight
social workers to manage 3,600 refer-
rals and 200 high-risk patients a year.
This team does all it can to keep up
with the staggering number of refer-
rals, but they simply do not have the
capacity to conduct outreach to vet-
erans in the community who may need
help.
Suicide prevention team staffing
shortages in Atlanta and at VA med-
ical facilities across the country is why
H.R. 2333, introduced by Congressman
BRINDISI, is so important.
It would direct the Government Ac-
countability Office to access the work-
load and vacancy rates of VA suicide
prevention coordinators. This report is
essential to better informing Congress
of the current state of suicide preven-
tion coordinators, the resources at the
facilities where they work, and the
challenges they face in addressing the
needs of our most vulnerable veterans.
The role of these coordinators is vital
to combating veteran suicide, and this
report will illustrate where the gaps in
care delivery exists, especially for the
clinicians, social workers, and suicide
prevention coordinators working on
the front lines.
I fully support this bill and I really
want to thank Mr. BRINDISI for cham-
pioning this legislation, and I urge my
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 2333.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such

Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2333, the Support for Sui-
cide Prevention Coordinators Act. This
bill would require a Government Ac-
countability Office report on the re-
sponsibilities, management, workload,
training, and vacancy rates of Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs suicide pre-
vention coordinators. The VA employs
at least one suicide prevention coordi-
nator in every VA medical center to
coordinate, care for, and conduct out-
reach to servicemembers and veterans
at risk of suicide.
These men and women are on the
front lines of the fight against the
tragic loss of 20 of our Nation’s service-
members and veterans every day to
self-harm. We must ensure that they
are appropriately staffed, supported,
and overseen as they go about their dif-
ficult and incredibly important work.
Passage of the Support for Suicide Pre-
vention Coordinators Act today will
help us do just that.
This is a bipartisan bill sponsored by
several members of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee, including Congress-
man JIM BANKS from Indiana, ranking
member of the Subcommittee on Tech-
nology Modernization; Congressman
MIKE BOST of Illinois, the ranking

member of the Subcommittee on Dis-
ability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs; Congressman STEUBE from Flor-
ida, a member of both the Disability
Assistance and Memorial Affairs Sub-
committee, and Health Subcommittee.
I am grateful to each of them, as well
as the bill’s lead sponsor, Congressman
ANDY BRINDISI from New York, for
their efforts.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all
Members to join me in supporting H.R.
2333, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
New York (Mr. BRINDISI), my good
friend and the author of H.R. 2333.
Mr. BRINDISI. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of H.R. 2333 and
taking action to address the crisis of
veteran suicide.
As we know too well, data from the
Department of Veterans Affairs indi-
cates that 20 veterans die from suicide
every day. I want to thank Chairman
MARK TAKANO, and Ranking Member
PHIL ROE for their bipartisanship and
their commitment to addressing this
crisis and bringing these bills to the
floor today for a vote.
One area we have to get right is the
work of VA’s suicide prevention coordi-
nators. Suicide prevention coordina-
tors are the face of the VA’s efforts to
combat veteran suicide. They identify
high-risk veterans and ensure they re-
ceive appropriate care. They conduct
outreach and promote awareness and
suicide prevention best practices with-
in the VA.
However, many suicide prevention
coordinators report being overworked
and unable to keep up with their many
responsibilities. In an effort to improve
suicide prevention and mental health
resources at the VA, I introduced H.R.
2333, the Support for Suicide Preven-
tion Coordinators Act with my friends
on the other side of the aisle, Congress-
man BANKS, and Congressman BOST.
Clear Path for Veterans, which is a
veteran service organization in my dis-
trict doing incredible work to engage
with and support veterans after they
return home from service described
this bill very well.
They said:
In the last decade, a large number of bills
and initiatives have come out of Washington,
D.C. aiming to combat veteran suicide.
While all great in concept, we have not seen
a huge change in suicide rates.
H.R. 2333 is a great way to measure what is
effective, what is not, and how the VA should
pivot on what they are currently doing to
better meet the mental health needs of the
veterans they serve.
The Support for Suicide Prevention
Coordinators Act would help ensure
prevention coordinators have the re-
sources they need to effectively pro-
vide veterans with critical mental
health resources to prevent future vet-
eran suicides.
Specifically, this bill would require
the Comptroller General of the United
States to conduct an assessment of the
responsibilities, workload, and vacancy
rates of the Department of Veterans
Affairs suicide prevention coordinators
and submit a report to Congress within
1 year.
It is critically important that we
provide our suicide prevention coordi-
nators with the resources they need to
successfully address the veteran sui-
cide epidemic, and I believe this bill is
a good step toward making sure that
happens.
Again, I thank the committee for
their bipartisan work. Taking care of
our veterans is the responsibility that
belongs to each of us, and I urge my
colleagues to support this important
legislation and all of the veterans bills
on the floor today.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST),
my good friend, the previous chairman
and now ranking member on the Dis-
ability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee, and a Marine vet-
eran. I have seen this Marine drink
from the Devil Dog fountain in Belleau
Wood.
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I thank
Ranking Member ROE and Chairman
TAKANO for allowing this piece of legis-
lation to move forward.
As a veteran, first off, let me say
this: I couldn’t be prouder than to
serve on the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee with the men and women we
serve with because we get the oppor-
tunity to actually, hopefully, make a
difference in those veterans’ lives.
Twenty veterans commit suicide
every day, and as was mentioned a
while ago, that number hasn’t changed
much. So clearly, the current situation
is not good enough.
We need to think differently about
veteran suicide. President Trump re-
cently took action on this issue. Now
Congress is too, and it is vitally impor-
tant that we do. We are acting in a bi-
partisan manner.
I am honored to stand with the gen-
tleman from New York in supporting
this legislation to improve the VA’s
suicide prevention coordinators.
Veteran suicide isn’t a Republican or
Democrat issue, and I am proud of the
work we have been doing to try to help
our veterans. They deserve our help,
and, hopefully, with this bill, they are
going to get it.
We have to turn the tide on our vet-
erans that are committing suicide
around this Nation at the level that
they are. We have to do everything we
can.
This bill, I believe, was a step in the
right direction. I believe that we
should pass it to the Senate as quickly
as possible, and the Senate should then
move forward, and then it should be
implemented.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
As I said in my remarks related to
Mr. BRINDISI’s legislation, I visited the
Atlanta VA Medical Center and it re-
ceives 3,600 referrals per year from the
Veterans Crisis Line, which is the high-
est number of crisis line referrals any
individual veteran medical center re-
ceives nationwide.
I know that at the medical center
itself that there is a 22 percent vacancy
rate among mental health profes-
sionals. They have lost eight psychia-
trists across their hospital and out-
patient clinics since the beginning of
the year. Staff who resigned have cited
salaries and workload stress as their
main reasons for leaving the VA.
Mr. BRINDISI’s legislation goes to,
however, the position of suicide preven-
tion coordinators, and currently, the
coordinators at this particular medical
center are staffed up, but we are trying
to figure out where these staff coordi-
nator positions across the country may
be vacant or insufficient because we
know these crisis lines are being used.
We have to make sure that we have the
coordinators to respond to them.
But in addition to that, we need coor-
dinators to do the outreach events to
reach those veterans who are not con-
nected with the VA. So the VA medical
center in Atlanta is just one example
of the staffing shortages in VA hos-
pitals and clinics throughout the coun-
try. We know that beyond the stress
and strain of our psychiatrists and of
our suicide prevention coordinators,
which Mr. BRINDISI’s bill addresses,
there are nearly 50,000 vacancies at VA.
If we want to fully address the vet-
eran suicide crisis in this country, we
need to make sure that suicide preven-
tion teams are sufficiently staffed and
do more to address mental health clini-
cian understaffing.
Mr. BRINDISI’s legislation is a signifi-
cant step in making sure all of this
happens.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all
Members to support this piece of legis-
lation.
I, too, have visited Canandaigua,
which is in New York, which is a call
center, and I think this committee is
doing everything it can in a bipartisan
way to help lower this unbelievable
rate of 20 suicides per day.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all
Members to support this piece of legis-
lation, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I cer-
tainly appreciate the partnership and
the spirit of the ranking member of the
committee in addressing this national
crisis of veteran suicide, and H.R. 2333
is an essential and significant step that
we are taking to address this crisis.

leagues to join me in passing H.R. 2333,

time.

and resources, I rise today in strong support
of H.R. 2333, the ‘‘Suicide Prevention Coordi-
nators Act.’’
I support H.R. 2333 because this legislation
will provide much needed assistance to the
VA to reduce the incidence of suicide among
our veterans. The ‘‘SPCA’’ provides DVA sui-
cide prevention coordinators with the re-
sources needed to effectively do their job of
providing veterans with critical mental health
resources to veterans in need.
Madam Speaker, veteran suicide is a perva-
sive and critical issue, threatening, and in to
many heartbreaking cases, taking the lives of
many of our heroes.
Although, the Department of Veterans Ad-
ministration has screening protocols designed
to aid veterans and to stage suicide interven-
tions, about 6,000 veterans fall through the
cracks of this system annually, finding them-
selves without the necessary aid and re-
sources that were promised to them.
Many suicide prevention coordinators and
offices specializing in veterans affairs report
being overworked and unable to keep up with
the demand for their services.
On average, about 20 veterans die every
day by suicide and since 2017, 25 veterans
have taken their lives on the grounds of Vet-
erans Affairs hospitals, including seven this
year and at least four last month. These vet-
erans were actively seeking help from an un-
prepared and under resourced agency before
they took their lives.
It is long past time for Congress to provide
the help needed to address the troubling in-
crease in veteran suicides and help improve
suicide prevention and mental health re-
sources at the at DVA.
It is imperative that the DVA has the tools
it needs to serve every veteran that walks
through the door.
The ‘‘Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act’’
would require the Comptroller General to as-
sess the responsibilities, workload, and va-
cancy rates of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs Suicide Prevention Coordinators and re-
port it to Congress within one year, on the
ability of the DVA to detect and protect vet-
erans from self-harm.
It is critically important that we provide sui-
cide prevention coordinators with the re-
sources needed to successfully combat the
troubling trend of veteran suicide, and I be-
lieve this bill is a necessary step in the right
direction.
Madam Speaker, it is unconscionable that a
veteran will commit suicide every hour.
The fact that veterans make up just 20 per-
cent of the male population, yet veterans
make up close to 32 percent of all male sui-
cides is shocking and must spur our action.
It does not have to be this way, Madam
Speaker, and we can do something about it,
starting with the passage of H.R. 2333, the
‘‘Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act.’’
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
TAKANO) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2333.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
FOSTERING INTERGOVERNMENTAL
HEALTH TRANSPARENCY IN

Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
move to suspend the rules and pass the
bill (H.R. 2340) to direct the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs to provide to Con-
gress notice of any suicide or at-
tempted suicide of a veteran in a De-
partment of Veterans Affairs facility,
and for other purposes, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2340
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fostering Inter-
governmental Health Transparency in Veteran
Suicides Act’’ or ‘‘FIGHT Veteran Suicides
Act’’.

AND ATTEMPTED SUICIDES OF VET-
ERANS IN DEPARTMENT OF VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS FACILITIES.
Section 1720F of title 38, United States Code,
is amended by adding at the end the following
new subsection:
‘‘(l) CONGRESSIONAL NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.—

signs that are often exhibited by veterans at risk
of suicide; and
‘‘(C) provide notice of the resources the De-
partment offers to veterans who may be at risk

Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2340,
as amended.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, since the beginning
of this year, seven—seven—veterans
have died by suicide in or on the
grounds of VA facilities. Sadly, an-
other suicide occurred at a VA hospital
in Washington just this weekend.
Currently, VA staff notify both the
House and Senate Committees on Vet-
erans’ Affairs of the events as a matter
of courtesy; however, should the De-
partment’s leadership change, there is
no assurance this courtesy would con-
tinue.
I have made veteran suicide preven-
tion the top priority for the Committee
on Veterans’ Affairs because 20 suicides
a day is far too many. One suicide is
far too many. But to address this
alarming trend, Congress must be in-
formed when a suicide occurs on a VA
campus and must be provided all rel-
evant data.
This information will allow the com-
mittee to conduct appropriate over-
sight, write legislation that will im-
prove outcomes, and, when necessary,
hold individuals accountable when
there are clear failures that impact the
timely and adequate care for veterans.
As such, H.R. 2340, as amended, the
FIGHT Veteran Suicides Act, would re-
quire the VA Secretary to notify Con-
gress following an attempted or a com-
pleted suicide by a veteran in or on the
grounds of a VA facility.
This measure also requires VA to
provide Congress with communications
guidance to deter the sensationalism of
suicide, provide information on identi-
fying the warning signs often exhibited
by veterans at risk of suicide, and iden-
tify resources offered by the Depart-
ment for at-risk veterans, including
the Veterans Crisis Line and Vet Cen-
ter readjustment counseling.
It is essential that this information
be shared, regardless of leadership at

I thank Congressman ROSE, a combat

this tragic national public health cri-
sis, and I want to commend him for his
leadership and for writing this impor-
tant legislation that will ensure Con-
gress has all the data it needs to truly

I encourage my colleagues to join me

Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such
time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2340, as amended, the
FIGHT Veteran Suicides Act.
This bill would require the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs to report to
the local congressional delegation, as
well as to the committee, whenever a
veteran attempts or dies by suicide in
or on the grounds of a VA facility.
We have all heard the heartbreaking
stories of veterans who have died by
suicide on VA campuses, including five
veteran suicide deaths in the last sev-
eral weeks alone. There is no indica-
tion that these events represent an in-
crease in the rate of suicide among
servicemembers and veterans, but they
are particularly poignant because they
occur so close to help and appear to be
an indictment on the healthcare sys-
tem that was created to support them.
To be clear, suicide is a national pub-
lic health crisis that is not unique to
VA, the military, or veterans. How-
ever, we must pay careful attention to
the incidents of suicide among those
who have served and sacrificed on our
behalf and do everything we can to
point those in crisis to the resources
they need to recover from the traumas
and live long, full, healthy lives.
I am grateful to Congressman MAX
ROSE from New York for sponsoring
this bill, which will allow us to learn
all we can about the suicides that
occur on VA campuses so that we can
take action that may save other lives
in the future.
I encourage all Members to support
this much-needed piece of legislation.

of December 1, 2019, the rates of com-
pensation for veterans with service-
connected disabilities and the rates of
dependency and indemnity compensa-
tion for the survivors of certain dis-
abled veterans, and for other purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:

SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COM-
PENSATION AND DEPENDENCY AND
INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.
(a) RATE ADJUSTMENT.—Effective on De-
cember 1, 2019, the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs shall increase, in accordance with sub-
section (c), the dollar amounts in effect on
November 30, 2019, for the payment of dis-
ability compensation and dependency and in-
demnity compensation under the provisions

clude extraneous material on H.R. 1200.

There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1200, the Vet-
erans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living
Adjustment Act of 2019 would require
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to in-
crease the rates of disability com-
pensation for service-connected vet-
erans and the rates of dependency and
indemnity compensation for survivors
of veterans, effective December 1, 2019.
Now, this bill would also increase
these rates by the same percentage as
the percentage by which Social Secu-
rity benefits are increased effective De-
cember 1, 2019, and require that VA
publish the increased rates in the Fed-
eral Register.
To me, the actual cost-of-living ad-
justment to veterans’ benefits, other-
wise known as COLA, is much more
than a rate adjustment tied to infla-
tion. In reality, it is a quality-of-life
guarantee in retirement years, espe-
cially for veterans suffering with serv-
ice-connected disabilities and ailments.
It also comes with the assurance for
veterans that their survivors will not
see a steady decline in benefits if the
economy changes and costs rise after
they are gone. This guarantee is a
great source of comfort for veterans as
they age. I know this because they tell
me this everywhere I go.
The yearly COLA increase is a rec-
ognition and appreciation of a grateful
nation of the service and sacrifice of
those who volunteer to wear the uni-
form of our country.
Participating in this gesture of ap-
preciation is one of the most rewarding
responsibilities of the Committee on
Veterans’ Affairs. As chairman, I am
honored to be leading this effort to say
thank you.
I want to recognize the work of the
Disability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee chair, ELAINE
LURIA, and ranking member, MIKE
BOST, for sponsoring H.R. 1200 and for
bringing this bill to the floor today.
I am pleased that we are considering
this bill early this year so veterans will
not be concerned about its passage by
the December 1 deadline.
I wholeheartedly support H.R. 1200
and urge all my colleagues to do so as
well.

ance of my time.

sistance and Memorial Affairs Sub-
committee Chair ELAINE LURIA and
Ranking Member MIKE BOST. I appre-
ciate their commitment to ensuring
that veterans and their families can af-
ford living expenses when prices go up.
H.R. 1200 authorizes a cost-of-living
increase for veterans and their families
next year if Social Security recipients
receive an increase.
To put this in perspective, in 1975, a
veteran who was rated totally disabled
would receive at least $655 in monthly
disability compensation. Because of
the COLAs that Congress has passed for
decades, totally disabled veterans now
receive $2,907 in tax-free monthly dis-
ability compensation, an increase of
443 percent over the years. As you can
see, H.R. 1200 is necessary to prevent
inflation from eroding the value of vet-
eran and survivor benefits.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all
Members to support H.R. 1200, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Virginia (Mrs. LURIA), who is my
good friend and the chairwoman of the
Disability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee and also a cospon-
sor of H.R. 1200.
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of my bipartisan bill,
H.R. 1200, the Veterans’ Compensation
Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2019.
In Congress, I have vowed to keep our
Nation’s veterans at the top of my
mind, and I plan to deliver on that
promise through this critical piece of
legislation.
I represent a coastal Virginia district
with eight major military installa-
tions, including Naval Station Norfolk,
the largest naval station in the United
States, so veterans are clearly a crit-
ical part of my constituency, just as
they are honored members of every
congressional district across America.
Our veterans put their lives on the
line and are deployed far from home to
keep America safe. As a 20-year Navy
veteran myself, I am proud to bring a
bill to the floor that would eliminate
the erosions of benefits they earned in
service to our country.
The Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-
Living Adjustment Act would recog-
nize that the benefits we provide our
veterans need to be modernized and in-
creased the same way that Social Secu-
rity has raised benefits to meet cost-of-
living increases.
b 1645
My bill enhances benefits for war-
time disability compensation, com-
pensation for dependents, clothing al-
lowance, dependency and indemnity
compensation to surviving spouses, and
dependency and indemnity compensa-
tion to children.
We have seen costs for disability
care, clothing, and childcare increase
over the years, and it is vital that we
continue to provide benefits that actu-
ally meet the demands that our vet-
erans see on the ground.
A cost-of-living increase would aid
veterans, their families, and their sur-
vivors to help maintain the value of
their benefits against inflation. With-
out consistent increases, veterans and
their families may not be able to have
a consistent quality of life into their
later years.
Providing quality benefits to our vet-
erans and their dependents can change
lives, and Congress must honor the
commitment to those American heroes
who served in harm’s way so that we
can live in peace at home.
I thank my colleagues on the Dis-
ability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee and my ranking
member, MIKE BOST, for being a co-
sponsor of this legislation, and I urge
swift House passage so that we can do
our part to push this into law and help
our Nation’s veterans.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST),
ranking member of the Subcommittee
on Disability Assistance and Memorial
Affairs and a marine veteran.
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, this is a
must-pass bill.
I want to thank the chairman and
the ranking member for moving this
piece of legislation forward as well.
Many disabled veterans and their
families depend on their veterans bene-
fits to pay for things like food and
medicine. For many of these veterans,
these payments are a lifeline. In some
cases, the benefits may even be the
only income that the veteran has.
It is only fair that we ensure that the
benefits paid to veterans who were in-
jured during military service do not
lose value because of inflation. If we
don’t, it could become hard for people
who were injured while serving our Na-
tion in uniform to keep their heads
above water.
I want to thank Disability Assistance
and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee
Chair LURIA for her introduction of the
bill.
Madam Speaker, this bill has always
enjoyed bipartisan support. I urge my
colleagues to support H.R. 1200.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I have no further
speakers, and I am prepared to close.
Madam Speaker, I encourage every-
one to support this commonsense bill.
I think my last duty assignment was
probably in Mrs. LURIA’s district, Fort
Eustis, Virginia. That is where my last
9 months in the Army was.
I was raised in a military town: Fort
Campbell, Kentucky, and Clarksville,
Tennessee. I grew up around the mili-
tary, and I just cannot thank them
enough.
This is the very least we can do for
our disabled veterans, to give them a
COLA which will, hopefully, make
their lives a little bit better and thank
them for their service.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all
Members to support this legislation,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I,
too, join my ranking member in asking
all of our colleagues to pass H.R. 1200.
I thank Chairwoman LURIA and
Ranking Member BOST of the Sub-
committee on Disability Assistance
and Memorial Affairs for their hard
work.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1200, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
TAKANO) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1200.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2372,
as amended.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, to meet the needs of
veterans, VA has long relied on com-
munity partners to provide outreach
and services, particularly to address
mental health needs and suicide pre-
vention.
The number of mental health- and
suicide prevention-related agreements
between VA and these organizations
has increased exponentially since 2014.
It is anticipated that these relation-
ships will continue to grow in the
months following the signing of Execu-
tive Order No. 13861 on March 5, 2019.
Now, this executive order seeks to es-
tablish grants to local communities to
better collaborate and integrate serv-
ice delivery and resources for veterans.
As reliance on outside groups grows,
Congress must better understand the
effectiveness of the programs and men-
tal health services these private orga-
nizations offer. VA must also ensure
such partnered organizations are able
to provide quality, culturally com-
petent, evidence-based services to vet-
erans.
Congresswoman UNDERWOOD’s legisla-
tion, H.R. 2372, as amended, would re-
quire the Government Accountability
Office to study the effectiveness of
these partnerships between VA and or-
ganizations providing services related
to suicide prevention and mental
healthcare.
When complete, GAO would report
their findings to the House and Senate
Veterans’ Affairs Committees. As part
of the assessment, GAO is required to
look at several factors, such as the
staffing structure of the organization,
its accreditations or licensures, the
level of oversight and tracking of out-
comes by VA, and the secure exchange
of data and information.
The GAO would also be required to
study the ability of these organizations
to serve unique subsets of the veteran
population, including, women, minori-
ties, older and younger veteran co-
horts, families, and veterans who re-
side in U.S. insular areas.
I thank Ms. UNDERWOOD for intro-
ducing this legislation because it will
ensure VA is responsibly leveraging its
community partnerships to reduce vet-
eran suicide and support VA in its
transformation to a public health ap-
proach to suicide prevention. This pub-
lic health approach focuses on preven-
tion and intervention before veterans
are in crisis.
As I previously mentioned, a two-
pronged strategy is necessary to ad-
dress the national crisis of veteran sui-
cide. These Federal, State, and local
partnerships are integral to the first
prong of the strategy of prevention and
early intervention.
It is critical that we develop these
partnerships as part of an infrastruc-
ture to support veterans. This legisla-
tion will ensure we are using taxpayer
funds effectively to partner with those
organizations providing quality, evi-
dence-based programs.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port this legislation, and I encourage
all my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R.
2372, as amended.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such
time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2372, as amended, the Vet-
erans’ Care Quality Transparency Act.
This bill is sponsored by Congress-
woman LAUREN UNDERWOOD of Illinois,
and I thank her for her efforts to bring
it to the House floor today.
This bill would require the Govern-
ment Accountability Office to conduct
an assessment of the effectiveness of
all memoranda of understanding and
memoranda of agreement entered into
by the Department of Veterans Affairs
and other governmental or private-sec-
tor entities regarding suicide preven-
tion activities and outreach, as well as
the coordination of mental health serv-
ices, during the 5-year period preceding
the date of enactment.
For the last two decades, approxi-
mately 20 of our Nation’s servicemem-
bers and veterans have died by suicide
on a daily basis.
Suicide is, unquestionably, a tragedy
that impacts all Americans and is a
crisis that VA cannot combat alone. In
light of that, VA has become increas-
ingly mindful of the need to collabo-
rate with partners in both the public
and private sectors to connect with
servicemembers, veterans, and their
families wherever they reside and with
whatever they may be struggling.
This bill would ensure that Congress
has insight into those collaborations
and whether or not they are working as
intended to reduce incidents of suicide
among those who have served our coun-
try.
Madam Speaker, I encourage all
Members to support this bill today, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD), my
good friend, member of the Disability
Assistance and Memorial Affairs Sub-
committee, and author of H.R. 2372.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of my bill, the
Veterans’ Care Quality Transparency
Act.
With Memorial Day just around the
corner, I am humbled to see these bi-
partisan efforts to bring forward legis-
lation that will help all veterans re-
ceive the care that they have earned
through their service to our Nation.
I am so pleased to see the chairman’s
focus on ensuring access to healthcare
for veterans, particularly women vet-
erans, who face unique challenges navi-
gating a VA system originally designed
to serve men.
I am committed to working to make
needed improvements to the VA by
working with my colleagues on the
Servicewomen and Women Veterans
Congressional Caucus and on the
Women Veterans Task Force.
I am also pleased to see this bipar-
tisan, wide-ranging focus on veterans’
mental health and suicide prevention.
Our work, however, has just begun.
We have an urgent responsibility to
continue to fight for the highest stand-
ards of care on behalf of veterans.
Despite much good work by the VA
and significant Federal investment, the
veteran suicide rate hasn’t gone down.
We must empower the VA to find inno-
vative, effective ways to end this crisis.
That is why I have introduced this bill,
which will address a vital but over-
looked part of veteran suicide preven-
tion.
The bill directs the GAO to evaluate
the effectiveness of agreements that
the Department of Veterans Affairs has
with outside providers for mental
healthcare and suicide prevention serv-
ices.
Expanding access to care for veterans
struggling with mental health or with
thoughts of suicide is an essential part
of reducing veteran suicide rates, and
partnering with providers outside the
VA is just one way to do that. But
there just isn’t enough data on the
ability of these outside providers to
meet the high standards of care we ex-
pect from the VA.
All veterans deserve access to con-
venient and high-quality healthcare,
and it is unacceptable that outside pro-
viders are not currently held to the
same high standards as the VA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4045
May 21, 2019
The mission of the VA is undermined
each time a veteran receives sub-
standard care. My bill would help en-
sure outside providers are held to the
standard of providing high-quality
mental healthcare and suicide preven-
tion services.
Our efforts to stop veteran suicide
need to focus on wider, better in-
formed, and data-driven paths to tan-
gible results so that we can save lives.
This bill is about increasing trans-
parency so that we can ensure that
those who have served our Nation are
not left behind when they return home.
I am grateful to my colleagues on the
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs who
have reaffirmed their commitment to
this issue and who have acted so quick-
ly to respond to the veteran suicide cri-
sis with the focus and resources it de-
serves.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
support this bill.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I have no further

Madam Speaker, I want to thank
Congresswoman UNDERWOOD for sub-
mitting this legislation today. I think
it is much needed. I have thought it all
along. Let’s find out what works and

doing this, and I feel like it will be sup-

I encourage all Members of the body

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2045,
as amended.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, when our service-
members conclude their military serv-
ice, they are taxed with returning to
civilian life after putting their lives on
hold for years. This is the sacrifice
they make for our security.
In exchange, we owe them more than
a thank you and well wishes. We owe
them a commitment that their transi-
tion to civilian life will go smoothly,
and a VA that responds to their needs.
That is why we passed the first GI
Bill nearly 75 years ago, and why we
continue today to make improvements
to provide veterans with the benefits
they have earned.
Unfortunately, VA has struggled to
track the effectiveness of education
and employment programs and, con-
sequently, Congress has struggled to
determine the Department’s resource
needs. We have identified a contrib-
uting factor through hearings and dis-
cussions with our Veterans Service Or-
ganizations that the Veterans Benefits
Administration is simply asked to do
too much.
With the focus on managing count-
less compensation claims, the responsi-
bility of managing transition edu-
cation, and housing benefits often
takes a back seat.
To put it in perspective, the Veterans
Benefit Administration’s structure has
not significantly changed since the cre-
ation of the Department of Veterans
Affairs in 1930.
During the last 89 years, the services
needed by veterans have drastically
changed, and that is why our com-
mittee has an Economic Opportunity
Subcommittee. It is time for the VA to
understand this as well.
The VET OPP Act, as amended,
would create a new administration
within the department to manage edu-
cational assistance, vocational reha-
bilitation and employment, education
and career counseling programs, and
broadly defined transition assistance
programs that are shared across agen-
cies.
Now, that means veterans’ education,
housing, and economic programs will
have a dedicated Under Secretary for
Veterans Economic Opportunity and
Transition. The Veterans Economic
Opportunity and Transition Adminis-
tration will solely focus on fulfilling
these promises to veterans, so that
they get the education that that they
want, the housing they need, and the
careers they deserve.
During our April 9 Economic Oppor-
tunity legislative hearing, this pro-
posal received support from the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, American En-
terprise Institute, and the Tragedy As-
sistance Program for Survivors.
Now these organizations know first-
hand how hard it is to navigate the
process of using benefits, so I want to
thank the hard work of our Economic
Opportunity Subcommittee for holding
hearings on H.R. 2045, as amended,
where this legislation received uni-
versal acclaim from our VSO commu-
nity.
I also want to thank our VSO com-
munity, and the American Federation
of Government Employees, who worked
with us to make this legislation work
for all veterans and all employees cur-
rently employed at the VA.
This is a bipartisan bill because we
are not trying to make a political
point or attack the VA. Instead, we
simply want to make the VA run more
effectively for the veterans it serves.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself as
much time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2045, as amended, the Vet-
erans’ Education Transition and Oppor-
tunity Prioritization Plan Act, or the
VET OPP Act.
Madam Speaker, investing in edu-
cation and employment opportunities
for our Nation’s veterans is one of the
Department of Veterans Affairs’ most
important but least recognized mis-
sions.
Today, programs concerning edu-
cation and employment are embedded
within the Veterans Benefit Adminis-
tration which, understandably, devotes

most of its time, attention, and re-
sources to disability compensation-re-
lated issues and backlogs that rise and
fall with time.
The focus on compensation programs
creates programs when other VBA pro-
grams need attention. An example of
this was the implementation last fall
of the Forever GI Bill which was, to
say the least, rocky, the start was.
While I know that the VA has many
dedicated employees who tried their
best to prevent the delays that oc-
curred, I do believe that if the imple-
mentation of this law had received
more attention from senior leaders at
VA, things could have been better.
The VET OPP Act is a means to miti-
gate these problems in the future. The
bill would create a new, fourth admin-
istration at VA which would be called
the Veterans Economic Opportunity
and Transition Administration and led
by a new Under Secretary for Veterans
Economic Opportunity and Transition.
The new Under Secretary would over-
see education benefits like the GI Bill,
the Vocational Rehabilitation and Em-
ployment Program, VA’s home loan
program, the Transition Assistance
Program, or TAP program, and the
small business programs. Creating a
new administration within VA to house
education and employment programs
will ensure that those programs receive
the focused leadership time and atten-
tion that they deserve.
I appreciate my friend and colleague,
Congressman WENSTRUP from Ohio, for
championing this legislation. It has my
full support.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
California (Mr. LEVIN), my good friend,
chairman of the Economic Opportunity
Subcommittee, and also a cosponsor of
H.R. 2045.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.
2045, the Veterans’ Education Transi-
tion and Opportunity Prioritization
Plan, or VET OPP Act of 2019.
Madam Speaker, I was proud to in-
troduce this bipartisan legislation with
my friend from Ohio, Mr. WENSTRUP.
We have a responsibility to provide
America’s servicemembers with the
best possible resources and opportuni-
ties as they transition back to civilian
life, and we must do more to meet that
responsibility.
Education, employment, housing,
and transition assistance programs are
critical to veterans’ economic success.
But many veterans aren’t receiving
these opportunities because of bureau-
cratic red tape at the VA. These pro-
grams are currently lumped with com-
pensation programs under the Veterans
Benefits Administration.
As chairman of the House Veterans’
Affairs Economic Opportunity Sub-
committee, one of my top priorities is
ensuring that veterans are receiving
their benefits as efficiently as possible,
and it is clear that the current struc-
ture at the VA isn’t meeting this need.
This bipartisan bill will allow us to
deliver economic resources more effec-
tively by creating a new Economic Op-
portunity and Transition Administra-
tion at the VA and bringing more over-
sight and accountability to economic
programs for veterans.
I strongly urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bipartisan legislation.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS), my good friend, and a Member
I have served with on the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee the entire time I have
been in Congress. As I have said pre-
viously, there is no one in this body, in
this House that I have seen that cares
for veterans more than Congressman
BILIRAKIS does, and he is the ranking
member on the Economic Opportunity
Subcommittee.
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to strongly support H.R.
2045, the Veterans’ Education, Transi-
tion, and Opportunity Prioritization
Plan, or the VET OPP Act of 2019,
which would create a significant struc-
tural change at the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs to better align and spe-
cialize economic opportunity for our
veterans, our true heroes.
As ranking member of the VA Eco-
nomic Opportunity Subcommittee, I
know this committee understands the
importance of prioritizing veterans’
education, workforce training, transi-
tion, and vocational rehabilitation pro-
grams.
However, the way the VA is struc-
tured, under the current system, it
puts all benefit programs under one
roof at the Veterans Benefits Adminis-
tration. While I certainly understand
that the VBA focuses a significant
amount of time on processing dis-
ability claims and working to decrease
its backlog of appeals, as the doctor
stated, my colleagues and I on the
committee have concerns that this has
led to an imbalanced amount of atten-
tion away from other benefit programs,
like the GI Bill education benefit and
the employment programs, such as the
vocational rehabilitation and employ-
ment, which is so very important as
well.
I fear that this lack of attention was
fully realized last year, again, as the
doctor stated, as VBA failed to prop-
erly implement sections 107 and 501 of
the Forever GI Bill.
This failure by the VA to update
their IT systems caused massive delays
in processing GI Bill claims for thou-
sands of student veterans last fall,
many of whom rely on their payments
as the only source of income. And
sadly, it was not the first time that the
VA has failed to provide GI Bill pay-
ments on time. Hopefully, it’s going to
be the last time.
To help solve this inequity, H.R. 2045,
the VET OPP Act, would create a
fourth administration at VA called the
Economic Opportunity and Transition
Administration, led by the new VA
Under Secretary appointed by the
President of the United States. This
new Under Secretary would be tasked
with managing all education, home
loans, small business certification,
transition assistance, and vocational
rehabilitation and employment bene-
fits within the VA.
This bill is a smart, commonsense
policy that will allow VA to improve
outcomes for our Nation’s veterans
seeking better economic opportunities.
Finally, the bill will allow Congress
to provide significantly better over-
sight and accountability of those run-
ning these programs.
I want to thank the sponsor of H.R.
2045, Dr. BRAD WENSTRUP, for intro-
ducing this legislation this Congress.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs.
AXNE). The time of the gentleman has

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman
from Florida an additional 30 seconds.
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I
also want to thank the chairman of the
subcommittee, my good friend, MIKE
LEVIN, who is doing an outstanding job
for co-leading the bill with us.
I urge my colleagues to pass H.R.
2045, as amended.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), my
good friend.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I thank the sponsor of this legislation
for really tapping into something that
every single Member must face with
their veterans, and certainly those who
have been out of the military for a pe-
riod of time, and then all of our new
veterans who are coming in from some
of the more recent conflicts that we
have had, and wars that we have had.
Just about a week or so ago, I was
meeting with veterans from a certain
battalion that had flown into Houston
to share with us their concerns about
the state of mind and the increasing
amount of suicides among veterans,
but, in addition to those conversations
and ones that I have had, the idea of a
Veterans Economic Opportunity and
Transition Administration and the
Under Secretary of Veterans Economic
Opportunity and Transition of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs to over-
see vocational rehabilitation employ-
ment, educational assistance, veterans
housing loans, and the verification of
small businesses.
b 1715
I think this is important because vet-
erans want to know that they can fully
integrate into society when they re-
turn home.
One of the initiatives that I had was
to ensure that their service-related
professions, whatever their assign-
ments were in the military, would
equate in civilian life and that they
would be respected for their hierarchy
of rank and also responsibility.
Having an office like this one helps
those veterans with creative minds
who want to start small businesses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4048 May 21, 2019
When we had the impact of Hurricane
Harvey, one of the hardest hit groups
were small businesses. We carved out
dollars to help small businesses by
grants and not loans because that is
the economic engine of this Nation.
With respect to veterans, they are
very creative. They see solutions where
there are problems. To have an office
that would focus on their vocational
rehabilitation, employment, and giving
them educational assistance, that is
also very important.
I have gone to my college campuses
and met many, many, many veterans
who are using some of the dollars that
this House provided for them back dur-
ing the first time Speaker PELOSI was
Speaker, when we voted on major ref-
ormation of the process of giving dol-
lars to veterans for their educational
assistance, a great bill dealing with
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans that has
helped them a lot.
I see the impact that getting a home
has on veterans as well, and I have
been involved in projects where organi-
zations are in the business of donating
homes to disabled vets. What a dif-
ference it makes in their lives.
Madam Speaker, I applaud the au-
thor of this legislation and the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee as well be-
cause you are now looking holistically
at these veterans and giving them a
hand up, as they want, and not a hand-
out.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentlewoman an additional 30
seconds.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman for his cour-
tesies.
Madam Speaker, I rise to support
this bill, H.R. 2045, because, as I have
said, whether it is a homeless vet,
whether it is a vet who has been a vet-
eran for a long period of time or those
in the recent conflicts or those coming
home today, this is a package that
they need.
This is what Members of Congress try
to help them with, in their offices. If
we knew that we had an office in the
Veterans Affairs Department that
deals with education, vocational reha-
bilitation, and small business, and it is
a one-stop shop, I think that our vet-
erans will appreciate that very much.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding, and I ask my col-
leagues to support H.R. 2045.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.
WENSTRUP), my good friend, a Con-
gressman, doctor, colonel, Iraq war
veteran, and in the previous Congress,
chair of the Health Subcommittee on
the Veterans Affairs’ Committee, and
currently a member of the House Com-
mittee on Armed Services and the
House Select Committee on Intel-
ligence.
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I
thank Dr. ROE for yielding. I appre-
ciate his leadership on the Veterans Af-
fairs’ Committee for the many years
that he has been here and has always
been a leader.
As an Iraq war vet and an Army re-
servist, I know how important it is to
help our warfighters succeed in their
transition from Active Duty to civilian
life. We should prepare our warfighters
for success outside the military from
the day they take their oath of enlist-
ment to the day they begin their civil-
ian careers. I think we have ignored
this for too long.
Leaving the military with a plan and
a purpose is key to the long-term well-
being of all of our servicemembers.
I know when I came back from Iraq
as a reservist, they said, ‘‘You have 90
days before you have to go back to
work.’’ I said, ‘‘I am going next week.
What am I going to do, sit around my
house and just look at the walls?’’
You go from having a job in the mili-
tary, where you have a purpose and a
meaning, and it is important that when
you get out that you have the same.
That makes the transition and your
life that much better.
Economic opportunity and transition
programs are critical support for vet-
erans when they complete their serv-
ice. The current structure of the VA al-
lows economic opportunity and transi-
tion programs for our veterans to fall
by the wayside. These programs should
be treated with the same importance as
health, compensation, and other bene-
fits.
The Veterans’ Education, Transition,
and Opportunity Prioritization Plan
Act, known as the VET OPP Act,
aligns transition, education, and em-
ployment programs in a fourth admin-
istration within the VA. This ensures
that these opportunity-focused pro-
grams get the high priority they de-
serve and the oversight they need to
better serve our veterans.
The VET OPP Act would streamline
services and help the VA empower vet-
erans and set them on a path to a suc-
cessful civilian life.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself as
much time as I may consume. I have no
further speakers, and I am prepared to
close.
Madam Speaker, I strongly encour-
age my colleagues to support this bill.
When I first got here to Congress in
2009, the Veterans Benefit Administra-
tion had 1 million backlogged dis-
ability claims. It is hard to focus on
something else when you have that
much on your plate.
I think we have recognized that over
the last several years, and I commend
Dr. Wenstrup and others for bringing
this up.
Madam Speaker, I strongly encour-
age all Members to support this, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself as much time as I might
consume.
Madam Speaker, if anyone thinks
that business as usual is working at
the VA, I would only ask you to look at
the implementation of the Forever GI
Bill. My good friend the ranking mem-
ber knows that there were definite
issues with the implementation. It did
not go well. We are still months away
from implementation, which should
have happened last year.
When the IG and others evaluated
what went wrong, one thing was very
clear: There was no accountable leader.
That is what happens when programs
are buried in layers of bureaucracy,
and that is why I urge my colleagues to
join me in passing H.R. 2045, as amend-
ed, the VET OPP Act, which will estab-
lish an accountable leader at VA for all
of those programs that we have under
the purview of our Economic Oppor-
tunity Subcommittee.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
TAKANO) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2045, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
The title of the bill was amended so
as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend title 38,
United States Code, to establish in the
Department the Veterans Economic
Opportunity and Transition Adminis-
tration, and for other purposes.’’.
A motion to reconsider was laid on

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1947,
as amended.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection.
PERMISSION FOR COMMITTEE ON VETERANS’ AF-
FAIRS TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT ON
H.R. 1947
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs be author-
ized to file a supplemental report on
the bill, H.R. 1947, as amended.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, this comprehensive
legislation addresses funding for VA re-
search and gives the VA authority to
work with grieving families to memori-
alize their loved ones. It also closes a
loophole that has allowed contracted
flight schools to charge public schools
unlimited tuition and fees to train vet-
erans using the GI Bill.
The first section of the measure ad-
dresses VA research. VA’s Office of Re-
search and Development improves the
lives of veterans, contributes to the na-
tional public health, and develops life-
saving biomedical breakthroughs that
change the world.
In its 90-year history, the VA’s med-
ical and prosthetic research has pro-
duced some of the world’s greatest ad-
vances. The VA developed the pace-
maker in 1960 and the shingles vaccine
in 2005. It created an effective smoking
cessation program and increased life
expectancy for people with spinal cord
injuries.
VA researchers were responsible for
beginning the first international
antiretroviral drug therapy trial to
find the optimal treatment for patients
with AIDS, for whom all therapy had
failed.
These research efforts usually aren’t
performed alone. They are often in col-
laboration with nonprofits, univer-
sities, other Federal agencies, and
international bodies.
When research is funded from non-VA
grants, it is managed by a for-profit
corporation, otherwise known as an
NPC, established at a VA Medical Cen-
ter, which allows flexible research
funding.
Last year, the VA’s Office of General
Counsel uncovered an appropriations
law limitation that prevents funding
transfers to these nonprofit research
corporations for longer than 1 fiscal
year. This has negatively affected sev-
eral ongoing multiyear projects across
the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4050 May 21, 2019
Dr. ROE’s legislation, H.R. 1947, as
amended, would provide explicit au-
thority for NPCs to administer re-
search funding without regard to fiscal
year limitations.
To ensure this legislation does not
raise spending, section 2 addresses a
loophole in GI Bill flight school bene-
fits.
This loophole had been exploited by
flight schools that had contracted with
public institutions of higher learning
to offer flight-related degrees. In some
cases, bad actors were exploiting GI
benefits that resulted in the VA paying
out over $500,000 in tuition and flight
payments to one student.
H.R. 1947 fixes this loophole by
marrying the cap on tuition at private
institutions with a cap on flight school
tuition at public institutions.
In addition, to ensure that the fewest
possible students are impacted, the leg-
islation also includes a provision to
allow flight school students to accel-
erate their GI Bill benefits. This will
allow them to be better used for flight
school, which is regularly more expen-
sive but takes fewer months to com-
plete.
Finally, section 3 of H.R. 1947, as
amended, authorizes VA to replace a
veteran’s headstone or marker in a pri-
vate cemetery so that an inscription
may be added to remember a deceased
spouse or a child following their
deaths.
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive LAMALFA for introducing the
original legislation and Ranking Mem-
ber ROE for offering the legislation as
an amendment during markup.
This bill is another example of our
committee working on a bipartisan
basis to get it right for all veterans.
This legislation allows veterans to
memorialize their loved ones in the
way they want and where they want.
Every veteran deserves to know that
their wish to be remembered in per-
petuity alongside spouses and their
children will be granted. The same is
true for surviving spouses and children
who want reassurance that they, too,
will be memorialized with their vet-
eran spouse or parent.
Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. ROE for
his tireless efforts to care for veterans,
and I commend him on this bill. I look
forward to joining him in voting ‘‘yes’’
on this legislation.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself as
much time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 1947, as amended.
This bill would address a limitation
in current law that prevents funding
from being transferred to the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs nonprofit re-
search and education corporations, or
NPCs, for longer than 1 fiscal year.
b 1730
NPCs were established by Congress in
the late 1980s to provide a flexible fund-
ing mechanism to support research.
Collectively, they have contributed
more than $2 billion to VA research
projects over the last decade.
However, last year, VA’s Office of the
General Counsel uncovered a legal lim-
itation that prevents funding from
being transferred to the NPCs for
longer than 1 fiscal year. This upturned
years of practice by the NPCs and
threatened a number of ongoing re-
search projects across the country that
could benefit veterans and all Ameri-
cans.
Madam Speaker, I have been involved
in a number of research projects over
the years, and they just don’t go for 365
days. Many of them go for years and
years. This bill would correct that lim-
itation and preserve the ability of the
NPCs to support important multiyear
research projects.
Additionally, H.R. 1947, as amended,
includes a provision from Representa-
tive LAMALFA’s bill, H.R. 1126, the Hon-
oring Veterans’ Families Act.
Currently, VA is authorized to add a
memorial inscription for a veteran’s
deceased spouse or eligible dependent
child to a VA-furnished marker, but
only if they are buried in a national
cemetery or a State or Tribal veterans
cemetery. Unfortunately, VA cannot
provide this benefit to veterans and
their families if they are buried else-
where, such as a private or local ceme-
tery. H.R. 1947, as amended, would ad-
dress this problem by allowing VA to
memorialize a veteran’s deceased
spouse or certain children on the vet-
eran’s marker, regardless of where they
choose to be laid to rest.
The cost of this bill will be paid for
by closing a loophole in GI Bill rules
related to flight schools by capping the
total tuition and fees that can be used
at a public school for flight training at
the current private school cap of $23,671
per year. The bill would authorize a 2-
year grandfather clause so that no cur-
rent students are impacted by this
change.
It also includes provisions that would
make it easier for students to attend
flight training by removing the prohi-
bition against GI Bill funds paying for
a private pilot’s license and giving stu-
dents the option to accelerate their GI
Bill benefits to pay for the increased
cost associated with flight training.
These changes to flight training for
the GI Bill have had wide bipartisan
and veteran service organization sup-
port in the past, and I am pleased that
they are included in this bill.
I encourage all Members to support
H.R. 1947, as amended.
I thank the chairman for his kind
comments and support of this bill.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from California (Mr.
LAMALFA), my good friend and an au-
thor of one part of this bill.
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
thank Ranking Member ROE and Chair-
man TAKANO for including my legisla-
tion, H.R. 1126, within H.R. 1947. It is
greatly appreciated. This is an over-
sight that was pointed out by northern
California veterans to me a while back,
the choice of being able to have a fam-
ily member, a spouse, inscribed on a
grave marker, simply the difference
being that it is in a Federal cemetery
or one that is private. That is really
the bottom line on this.
This bill changes that oversight so
that the choice can be at any recog-
nized cemetery. That is simply what
we are after: to have our veterans who
have served us honorably know that,
when they are at their final resting
place, that this oversight cannot hap-
pen for their family member that they
held so dear to share that gravestone
with them.
So, whether it is a private cemetery
or a VA, or whatever other type you
might have as your choice, veterans
need to have this choice as well.
Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking
Member ROE and Chairman TAKANO for
including this so we can take care of
this oversight quickly and have our
veterans have the choices that they
feel they deserve and, indeed, do de-
serve. I appreciate it.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
GOSAR), my good friend and Western
Caucus chair.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I rise not
against this bill, but I have concerns
about a provision capping the veterans’
training benefits. This severely under-
mines the important goal of helping
our Nation’s veterans enter a field
where they are desperately needed.
H.R. 1947 does have needed improve-
ments for structural veteran flight
training benefits. This includes an ac-
celerated payment provision to provide
greater flexibility and a more efficient
funding mechanism to help veterans
complete their flight training.
The bill also provides coverage for
obtaining a private pilot’s license when
it is incorporated into the require-
ments of a professional flight training
program.
Additionally, this action provides
flexibility to public schools, allowing
them to contract for flight training,
which, in turn, makes aviation train-
ing more available to interested vet-
erans.
There is improved fiscal responsi-
bility by the government, and there is
strong support for tightening the exist-
ing regulations of the Department of
Veterans Affairs to curb abuses by a
minority of flight schools affiliated
with collegian degree programs. How-
ever, the bill caps payments for flight

training programs, which unfairly im-
pacts the ability of veterans to pursue
well-paying jobs in the civilian avia-
tion sector.
Capping funds available for flight
training degree programs virtually
guarantees that veterans seeking to
use their GI Bill benefits to enter the
aviation industry will have insufficient
funds to achieve their goals. They will
either abandon their pursuit or be bur-
dened with significant personal debt
through either expenditure of personal
funds or taking on severe student
loans. This will harm veterans and
limit their employment opportunities
in the aviation industry.
It is unfair and discriminatory to sin-
gle out these funding caps for veterans
seeking employment in aviation. These
caps deprive them of the ability to pur-
sue collegian flight training, a common
path to a career as a commercial pilot.
I hope this provision can be addressed
prior to finding its way to the Presi-
dent. These jobs in aviation are in high
demand, and our veterans are some of
the most deserving and most needed.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I have no further
speakers, am prepared to close, and I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Before I yield back, I do want to ex-
press my disappointment that H.R. 2196
is not on the floor for consideration
this afternoon. This bill, introduced by
my friend and outstanding new mem-
ber of our committee, Congressman
BARR from Kentucky, would clarify the
eligibility of the Edith Nourse Rogers
STEM Scholarship program. This
scholarship, which was enacted as part
of the Forever GI Bill, authorizes extra
GI Bill funding to help student vet-
erans complete their undergraduate de-
grees in the science, technology, engi-
neering, and math, STEM, fields.
Madam Speaker, we all know that
there is a need to fill vacancies for
high-paying jobs in the STEM fields.
The Smithsonian Science Education
Center found STEM-related jobs grew
at three times the rate of non-STEM
jobs between 2000 and 2010. By 2018,
they projected that 2.4 million STEM
jobs would go unfilled.
The Edith Nourse Rogers STEM
Scholarship program is critical to en-
sure that veterans are the ones who fill
these vacancies. However, the way the
original law was drafted, it would unin-
tentionally prevent most students from
using this scholarship in all but a few
STEM programs.
With the scholarship going live on
August 1, 2019, I am grateful to Mr.
BARR for quickly stepping up to the
plate to offer this bill to ensure stu-
dents are eligible for it.
We all know that the Senate gen-
erally takes longer to review legisla-
tion than the House. Let me repeat
that. We all know that the Senate gen-
erally takes a lot longer to review leg-
islation than the House does. That is
why, with the August 1 deadline ap-
proaching quickly, I was hopeful we
could consider this legislation today.
The bill has gone through full regular
order, is supported by VA and veterans
service organizations, and has no cost.
I would ask the chairman if he would
please work with the majority leader
to schedule this bill for consideration
immediately after the Memorial Day
district work period.
Before I yield back, next Monday is
Memorial Day. For me, personally, I
want to thank all of the members of
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, the
chairman and others, as you have seen
today, for the work they have done in
a bipartisan way to help our Nation’s
heroes.
As I said, for me, personally, as a vet-
eran, this is a very difficult day be-
cause it is a day that we mourn the
loss of veterans who served on Active
Duty and paid the ultimate price. I
want to just mention a few names of
people.
First, Sergeant Thomas E. Thayer, a
tremendous man whom I knew as a
young boy growing up. He was my
Scout master. He was in the 101st Air-
borne and was killed in Vietnam, re-
ceiving the Silver Star in 1965.
Johnny Parham, who was also an
Eagle Scout, as I am. Johnny and I ran
on the 2-mile relay team together in
high school. I have to say, we were
pretty good. Johnny died in 1969 in
Vietnam and was unable to have the
wonderful life that I have had, to be
able to raise a family, have children
and grandchildren, because of service
to our Nation.
Bob Perry, a young man whom I went
to elementary school with all the way
through high school. I found out at my
high school reunion many years later
that Bob also died in Vietnam.
We just heard today, Chief Petty Of-
ficer Bill Mulder, a highly decorated
Navy SEAL who protected this Nation,
giving up his life because of, really, the
invisible wounds of war.
I just want to thank all of those who
paid the ultimate price for our free-
dom. Thank you, thank you, thank
you.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to join me in passing H.R. 1947.
Before I close, let me say that I ap-
preciate the kind words of the ranking
member, Dr. ROE of Tennessee, and I
associate myself with his eloquent trib-
utes to his classmates and the people
who did not get to live the full lives
that he, himself, has been able to live.
I, myself, have also known people
who have served our country and who
have also paid the ultimate price. I cer-
tainly do share his sentiments as we
enter this Memorial Day weekend, as
all Americans reflect on the ultimate
sacrifice of all the people buried in our
national cemeteries and cemeteries
that aren’t national cemeteries that
are marked by VA grave markers.
It is always a poignant moment to
walk through my national cemetery
and to watch the Girl Scouts and the
Cub Scouts planting American flags on
each and every grave and to see it all
happen within 20 minutes because
there are so many Americans who want
to come to my cemetery to make sure
that every grave is honored.
To my colleague from Tennessee, I
wish him a pleasant Memorial Day
weekend, but, also, to all Americans,
let us reflect on what Memorial Day
weekend does mean to our Nation.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
TAKANO) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1947, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
The title of the bill was amended so
as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend title 38,
United States Code, to exempt trans-
fers of funds from Federal agencies to
the Department of Veterans Affairs for
nonprofit corporations established
under subchapter IV of chapter 73 of
such title from certain provisions of
the Economy Act, and for other pur-
poses.’’.
A motion to reconsider was laid on

Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
Harrison Township, New Jersey, re-
cently celebrated its 175th anniversary.
This town has been a staple of south
Jersey for many years.
Harrison Township was built on
farming, as its local economy and its
access to Philadelphia and New York
continued its prosperity.
After the railroad opened in 1889, the
station became a major shipping point.
Postwar Harrison Township saw an era
of change and growth with new re-
gional highway construction that made
the area much more accessible to all.
Harrison Township in the 21st cen-
tury continues to grow with staples
like wineries, antique stores, continued
agriculture, and farming.
But what is most noticeable about
Harrison Township is their residents,
their people, those who are new, and
those who have been here for genera-
tions, like Vince Gangemi, Sr., who for
so many years has given back to their
wonderful town. They love their town.
South Jersey is proud to consider
this historical place a part of our com-
munity.

100 YEARS OF WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, this
country was built by great leaders on
the bedrock of even greater ideals. The
idea that all are created equal and en-
dowed with those certain inalienable
rights.
The idea that democracy was insti-
tuted not to bestow rights given to us
by God, but to safeguard them from
tyranny. The conviction that a govern-
ment’s power to protect our rights
comes solely by consent of the gov-
erned. But as we are a country of im-
perfect leaders, we often fall far short
of these perfect ideals.
And 100 years ago today, great
women brought this country into a new
age; an age where women are endowed
with that inalienable right to vote; an
age where women can safeguard their
rights at the ballot box; an age where
the power of our democracy comes
from the consent of all the governed.
And at a time when a woman serves
as Speaker of the House and there are
more Congresswomen with us today
than at any other point in our history.
We are in this age because of great
women. And I am honored to share this
House with so many of you.

UCLA’s excellence is clear. With 13
Nobel laureates, 13 MacArthur Fellows,
9 National Medal of Science winners, 3
Pulitzer Prize winners, a Fields Medal,
an A.M. Turing Award, UCLA’s aca-
demic credentials are rivaled by few.
And the UCLA Bruins have enjoyed
117 NCAA team championships and 261
Olympic medals over their 100-year his-
tory.
Alumni have gone on to make incred-
ible strides in fields like rocket
science, film, and politics. It has been
an incredible century for UCLA.
In honor of UCLA’s centennial, I
would like to extend my sincerest con-
gratulations to Chancellor Block, UC
President Janet Napolitano, and UCLA

I also want to recognize all the peo-
ple in UCLA’s history that ensured the

CELEBRATING 100 YEAR ANNIVER-

19TH AMENDMENT
(Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
I rise today with enthusiasm and grati-
tude that exactly 100 years to the day
this very body passed the 19th Amend-
ment which guaranteed women the
right to vote.
This decision was a critical step for-
ward, a major development in a rep-
resentative government to empower
millions of Americans and allow them
access to the fundamental freedoms en-
shrined in our Constitution.
The passage of the 19th Amendment
was an important turning point, and
the culmination of decades of fervent
activism by members of the women’s
suffrage movement and their allies.
Their vision and their tenacity paved
the way for generations of leaders who
would follow.
And in their honor, I am proud to be
the co-lead of H.R. 1980, the Smithso-
nian Women’s History Museum Act,
along with my friend and colleague,
CAROLYN MALONEY from New York, to
give these pioneers proper recognition
by constructing a National Women’s
History Museum on the National Mall.
Madam Speaker, I am privileged
today to be a Member of this House at
such a monumental time where there
are more women serving in the House
of Representatives than ever before. I
am proud to serve with them and to
honor this centennial anniversary by
their side.

CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF THE
PASSAGE OF 19TH AMENDMENT
(Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam
Speaker, today we come together to
celebrate 100 years since the United
States House passed the 19th Amend-
ment prohibiting the government from
denying the right to vote on the basis
of sex.
It was a milestone in the evolution of
women’s suffrage, but the hard work of
making sure that all women could vote
continued long after its passage.
Women still had to fight to build a
system where Native Americans, Afri-
can Americans, Asian Americans and
all women of color could not only reg-
ister to vote but could actually cast
their ballot.
In 1924, when Native Americans were
granted U.S. citizenship, we took a big
step toward Native American women’s
suffrage. And in 1964 when the Voting
Rights Act was passed, we took an-
other step in breaking down obstacles
that prevented Black women and other
women of color from voting.
The history of women’s suffrage, like
the history of our Nation, is complex,
but it is a history that we must ac-
knowledge and that we absolutely need
to reckon with, because we know that
people all over this country today still
face voter suppression.
So let’s take this opportunity to cel-
ebrate this historic day but let us also
recognize the full movement for wom-
en’s suffrage has continued long after,
and let’s recommit to making sure that
every citizen in this country can exer-
cise their constitutional right to vote
and participate in our democracy.

Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize the centen-
nial of the passage of the 19th Amend-
ment in the House of Representatives.
Women’s right to vote was won by
the brave work of suffragettes, many of
whom were from North Carolina.
In 1917, the National American
Women Suffrage Association held a 4-
day suffrage school in Raleigh to ad-
vance the movement in our State. In-
structor Halsey Wilson said, ‘‘We have
a government of men, by men, and for
the people, instead of a realization of
the hopes of Abraham Lincoln of a gov-
ernment of the people, by the people,
for the people.’’
Today, I am grateful to be serving
among the largest group of women ever
elected in this body. When the 19th
Amendment was ratified, 10 million
women joined the electorate, but the
suffragettes’ work also laid the founda-
tion for women in public offices and

today.

approved the 19th Amendment and
moved our Nation one step closer to
full voting rights for women.
I am so proud that the great State of
Michigan was among the first to ratify
the 19th Amendment, and I was proud
to join my colleagues today to pass a
bipartisan resolution to commemorate
and celebrate the amendment.
I rise now to honor all the suffrag-
ettes whose names we know and all
those we don’t, who put themselves in
danger to help make a more perfect
union. But I also rise to honor those
who follow in their footsteps, like my
incredible classmates in the 116th Con-
gress.
Just like the suffragettes helped
usher our Nation forward, they, too,
have opened doors that young women
like my own daughter, Molly, may
walk through some day.
It is an honor to fight alongside them
today and every day.

CONGRATULATING DR. DEBBIE
LUPEIKA
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate a great
woman and a doctor who is from my
district in northern California, who
earned an incredible honor over the
weekend.
Dr. Debbie Lupeika has been named
as the 2019 National Clinician of the
year by the Association of Clinicians
for the Underserved.
She teaches residents at Mercy Med-
ical Center in Redding, California, and
Shasta Community Health Center,
which serves mostly underserved or un-
insured patients.
Dr. Lupeika has helped treat many
families that were displaced from their
homes in Shasta County by the Carr
fire last year—everyone from children
to adults.
In rural communities like ours, it is
even more important to have great
doctors who truly care about their pa-
tients and their craft when also faced
with these rural issues that are so dif-
ficult for retaining doctors in rural
areas. Dr. Debbie Lupeika fully em-
bodies that in every way.
Madam Speaker, I thank her for her
commitment to improving healthcare
in our rural communities, and I con-
gratulate her on receiving this pres-
tigious award.

THE CENTENNIAL OF 19TH
AMENDMENT
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to commemorate
the 100th anniversary of the 19th
Amendment passing in the House giv-
ing women the right to vote.
Today, along with my yellow rose, I
stand here wearing a purple and a
black ribbon honoring the history of
African American women who are un-
sung heroes, like Sojourner Truth, and
Ida B. Wells, and Mary Church Terrell.
These women fought tirelessly so all
women would have the right to vote.
Although, even after the ratification of
the 19th Amendment, many Black
women and Native American women
were still denied their voting rights.
Madam Speaker, let us not forget the
sacrifices and the achievements of
Black women and all women of color
who continue to fight for women’s
right to vote, many of whose names we
may never know, but without whom
many of us would not be here today.
As we celebrate this important mile-
stone with this historic number of
women and women of color in Con-
gress, let us remember the words of
suffragette Mary Church Terrell. She
said: ‘‘And so, lifting as we climb, on-
ward and upward we go.’’
[From ACLU, May 18, 2019]
CELEBRATE WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE, BUT DON’T
WHITEWASH THE MOVEMENT’S RACISM
My 94-year-old great-aunt, Paralee Wil-
mer—we call her Aunty Lee—voted for the
first time after moving to Cincinnati, Ohio,
in 1944. Born to no-nonsense, small farmers
in Millers Ferry, Alabama, and the youngest
daughter of 12 children, Aunty Lee was one
among many African Americans who moved
from the South to the North in search of bet-
ter job opportunities and greater freedoms
during the The Great Migration. These free-
doms included the right to vote without in-
timidation or any other hindrance.
Aunty Lee’s memory is a bit cloudy re-
garding whether the first time she cast her
ballot was in an election for local politicians
or a presidential race, but one thing she
knows for sure is her pastor at the time in-
spired her to exercise her constitutional
rights and fulfill her civic duties. He said,
‘‘When it’s time to vote, make sure you vote.
When it’s time to do grand jury, make sure
you go.’’
At age 20, Aunty Lee understood the mag-
nitude of her pastor’s advice, given the dis-
enfranchisement of Black folks that she wit-
nessed growing up in Millers Ferry—includ-
ing poll taxes, literacy tests, and outright vi-
olence and intimidation that prevented
Black people from voting. To be a Black cit-
izen in America but denied full citizenship
rights epitomizes the hypocrisy of American
democracy. This is a sad truth that I repeat
like a blues refrain to my students.
This summer—as the nation celebrates the
170th anniversary of the first major conven-
tion for women’s rights at Seneca Falls and
the 98th anniversary of the 19th Amendment
to the Constitution, which granted women
the right to vote—how do we reconcile wide-
spread narratives of a triumphant, steady
march towards women’s enfranchisement
with the more complicated and painful re-
ality of my great-aunt’s lived experience as a
young, Black woman in Jim Crow America?
One word: intersectionality.
Legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw argues
that racism and sexism intersect in a man-
ner that compounds Black women’s oppres-
sion. Although the above historical events
occurred long before Crenshaw articulated
intersectionality, this insightful theory
should be applied to all historical narratives
that do not fully engage with the lived expe-
riences of African-American women.
What do we notice when we take an inter-
sectional view of the events that transpired
at Seneca Falls? How does our understanding
of the history of all women’s political em-
powerment in the United States change?
When suffragists gathered in Seneca Falls,
New York, in July 1848, they advocated for
the right of white women to vote. The par-
ticipants were middle and upper-class white
women, a cadre of white men supporters and
one African-American male—Frederick
Douglass. The esteemed abolitionist had
forged a strong working relationship with
fellow abolitionists and white women suffra-
gists, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
Susan B. Anthony. No Black women at-
tended the convention. None were invited.
Although women of color were profoundly
absent at Seneca Falls, a greater degree of
cultural inclusion was on the horizon. In
May 1851, African-American abolitionist So-
journer Truth spoke at a women’s rights
convention in Akron, Ohio. During her fa-
mous speech on the abolition of slavery and
the promotion of women’s rights, Truth al-
legedly bared her breast and proclaimed,
‘‘Ain’t I a woman?’’
It was a melodramatic act and statement,
but as historian Nell Painter argues, it never
happened Instead, it was a quaint fiction
crafted by convention organizer Frances
Dana Gage and other white feminists who de-
picted Truth to white audiences as a genuine
albeit primitive ally in the fight for women’s
rights. Thus, the 1851 convention marked a
modicum of progress, but this progress is
tainted by white suffragists’ attempts to
control Truth’s voice.
By the turn of the 20th century, Black suf-
fragists such as Mary Church Terrell rep-
resented intersectional feminism at its best.
Born to former slaves in Memphis, Ten-
nessee, Terrell earned her bachelor’s and
master’s degrees from Oberlin College and
served as president of the National Associa-
tion of Colored Women. In February 1898,
Terrell spoke at the National American
Woman Suffrage Association convention in
Washington, D.C.
Her speech forced powerful white women
attendees to reflect on the compounding op-
pressions and systemic violence that Black
women endured during slavery. She ended on
a more optimistic note—praising the sheer
grit and intellect of freed women. Terrell’s
rhetorical style echoed the American ethos
of self-made men and women, but she over-
simplified the historical reality that the
paths to racial and gender equality are long,
jagged, and still unwinding.
The history of women’s suffrage in Amer-
ica is not nice or neat, because the impact of
white supremacy is broad and human nature
is messy. Furthermore, a nation built on sto-
len land from Native Americans and stolen
labor from African slaves is flawed from the
start. We must constantly acknowledge this
truth and engage in an intersectional cele-
bration of women’s rights activists and land-
mark events.
In addition to celebrating the passage of
the 19th Amendment, let’s celebrate the up-
coming birthday of African-American suffra-
gist Mary Church Terrell, who would be 155
on September 23. Let’s celebrate the lives
and legacies of the true Sojourner Truth, ab-
olitionist and suffragist Harriet Tubman,
and Shirley Chisholm—the first Black
woman elected to Congress and to seriously
run for president.
Let us celebrate and support current-day
Black Lives Matter founders and organizers
Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal
Tometi, three queer Black women com-
mitted to ‘‘placing those at the margins clos-
er to the center’’ of political leadership. Last
but not least, let’s celebrate the lives of ev-
eryday people like my Aunty Lee—a Black
woman born and raised in Jim Crow Ala-
bama who sought out a better life in Ohio
and has religiously exercised her right to
vote for the past 74 years. Let us celebrate
these Black women while recognizing that
the struggle to vote without obstacles con-
tinues.

NEW LOCK AT THE SOO LOCKS
(Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Madam Speaker,
the Appropriations Committee has now
passed legislation with $75.3 million in
funding for the construction of a new
lock at the Soo Locks.
This is the first time in decades the
construction of a new lock at the Soo
Locks is being funded in legislation.
I have been pushing for this funding
with my work on the Appropriations
Committee, and I am grateful for the
support of our colleagues.
Right now, the lock is 50 years old,
and it has survived harsh winters
through extraordinary maintenance.

However, if it were to fail for an ex-
tended period, it would create a cas-
cading problem for the economy and
national security, because iron ore
that goes through the locks would have
no way to get from Lake Superior to
factories across the country.
Also, this is an issue that Democrats,
Republicans, and President Trump all
agree on.
When President Trump came to
Michigan last year, I was joined by
Congressman BERGMAN and Congress-
man MITCHELL. We told the President
about the Soo Locks, and he pledged
his support. That was backed up in
March when the Army Corps of Engi-
neers requested $75.3 million in its
budget for next year.
I appreciate and want to thank Presi-
dent Trump for his leadership on this.
That request is funded in legislation
now, and I look forward to working
with my colleagues to keep this con-
struction moving forward in the years
to come.

CELEBRATING ANNIVERSARY OF
19TH AMENDMENT
(Mrs. TRAHAN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to commemorate the pas-
sage of the 19th Amendment 100 years
ago today.
It is remarkable to imagine that the
fundamental right to vote was only
granted to women this recently. If only
the suffragettes who sacrificed so much
for so long could see the results of
their movement, that I would be serv-
ing in Congress shoulder to shoulder
with 131 women, the most in our Na-
tion’s history.
We know that better decisions are
made when more women are at the
table, from the boardroom to the floor
of this historic Chamber.
Women have been blazing the path of
social progress in the United States for
centuries, marching for civil rights,
striking for workers’ rights, organizing
against gun violence, and speaking out
on sexual harassment. Today, we con-
tinue to reshape our country, writing
new history in the Halls of Congress.
We stand on the shoulders of those
who came before us, women like Susan
B. Anthony, Shirley Chisholm, Edith
Nourse Rogers, and many more, and
make sure we do our part to pave the
new path for women to follow after us.
Madam Speaker, I am proud and hon-
ored to take part in celebrating the an-
niversary of the 19th Amendment.

CELEBRATING PATRIOTISM OF
AMERICAN WOMEN EARNING
RIGHT TO VOTE
(Mr. PALMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, al-
most from the day that I have been
elected to Congress, I have looked for-
ward to the opportunity to honor my
wife’s great-grandmother.
She was able to vote in the 1920 elec-
tion. Prior to that election, in Boston,
they distributed sample ballots. This
document that I have with me today
has been in my wife’s family for almost
100 years. On the back of the document,
Miss Abby Mayhew Cushing wrote this
note: ‘‘November 2, 1920. Cast my first
vote for President of these United
States.’’
You can feel the pride and the patri-
otism in those words that she experi-
enced for the first time. Abby Mayhew
Cushing was 67 years old.
With all due respect to my Democrat
colleagues, she wrote: ‘‘Voted straight
Republican ticket. Smashing victory
for Harding and Coolidge.’’ Then she
added this: ‘‘President Harding died
very suddenly August 2, 1923, in Cali-
fornia. Burial in Marion, Ohio, Friday,
August 10.’’
This is, for the Cushing family, a his-
toric document that celebrates the pa-
triotism of American women earning
the right to vote.

NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority
leader.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise, and I do so with the
love of my country within my heart,
and I do so this evening because I be-
lieve that no one is above the law. No
one.
We find this to be the case in our
great country: If you are a person who
exceeds the speed limit, you are break-
ing the law. If you are caught exceed-
ing the speed limit, there is a price to
pay. No one is above the law.
If you are a person who happens to,
in the State of Texas, decide that you
are going to go through the super-
market and pick and choose certain
things that you would like to sample,
at some point, if you partake of more
than is reasonable, you will be charged
with grazing. It is a crime in the State
of Texas to graze, to take more than
what is reasonable in having a sample
of a grape. No one is above the law.
People are prosecuted in the State of
Texas for grazing.
In the State of Texas, a good many
persons have been prosecuted for not
causing their children to go to school.
Thwarting public attendance in school
was a law in the State of Texas. People
paid fines for not having their children
in school.
The list of laws is too long to ever
mention in a statement such as this,
but the point is, no one is above the
law. There are laws that deal with per-
sons who commit felonies and persons
who commit misdemeanors. When you
break these laws, you are prosecuted.
You are not allowed to break the law
with impunity, and you are not allowed
to do it with immunity. No one is
above the law.
I believe that this is a part of the
very hallmark of our criminal justice
system in this great country. We be-
lieve that no one is above the law and
that no one is beneath the law, mean-
ing that the law should apply equally
to all. Every person ought to be treated
the same when it comes to the very
bedrock principle of whether or not
someone is above the law. No one is in
this country.
However, we find ourselves with a
unique circumstance now. We have the
highest office holder in the executive
branch, the chief executive officer, if
you will, who has refused to cooperate
with lawful investigations of the Con-
gress.
He refused to cooperate in this sense.
He has said to witnesses they should
not appear and give testimony in a
lawful investigation. He indicated that
subpoenas will not be answered. They
were issued pursuant to lawful inves-
tigations.
No one is above the law. If you are
not above the law, then if you are
called upon to testify, you must tes-
tify. If you have some document within
your possession and there has been a
request for it by way of a subpoena,
then you have to produce it. No one is
above the law.
Well, we currently have a cir-
cumstance where the chief executive
officer is at odds with the legislative
branch. This places the legislative and
the executive at odds with each other.
They are in a stalemate, if you will.
When this occurs, you have one
branch of government refusing to co-
operate with lawful requests of another
branch, the executive refusing the re-
quest of the legislative, then you have
a standoff, as I indicated. No one is
above the law.
This, in my opinion, creates a con-
stitutional crisis. Now, there are peo-
ple who would differ with me. But re-
member this: What they are expressing
is what I am expressing, an opinion.
This is my opinion. They have their
opinion. There is no hard and fast defi-
nition for a constitutional crisis.
There are some who would contend
that to have a constitutional crisis in
this area, the subpoenas that have been
issued would have to go to court. They
would have to be litigated. At some
point, a court might say to the execu-
tive branch of the government that it
must obey the subpoena issued by Con-
gress, the lawful subpoena.
If the executive officer declines to
obey the subpoena, it would be con-
cluded that you have a constitutional
crisis because the chief executive offi-
cer is not only disobeying Congress, he
is disobeying a third branch of the gov-
ernment, the judicial branch, the judi-
ciary. So you would then have a con-
stitutional crisis.
I differ. It is my opinion that you
have a constitutional crisis when the

chief executive officer declines and re-
fuses to obey a lawful request from the
legislative branch. I think that when
you get to the point that the President
of the United States, or the chief exec-
utive officer, refuses an order from the
court, you have a constitutional crisis,
but you also have a collapse.
That is when you have gone beyond a
constitutional crisis. It is a collapse.
The crisis leads up to that point. Once
this happens and the President refuses
to obey the judiciary as well as the leg-
islative, you have a collapse.
Right now, we are in a constitutional
crisis. In this constitutional crisis, we
have a circumstance that has devel-
oped that we cannot tolerate. You see,
it is the legislative branch that has the
duty to provide the check on the execu-
tive branch such that we maintain the
balance of power. When the legislative
branch seeks to check the executive
branch and it absolutely refuses to co-
operate, when this occurs, the system
of checks and balances is being ig-
nored.
The system of checks and balances
was put in place by the Framers of the
Constitution to prevent the concentra-
tion of power in any one branch of gov-
ernment. To prevent the executive
branch from having a concentration of
power, the legislative branch was given
this ability to check it.
When the legislative branch cannot
get cooperation, the ultimate check
that it has is impeachment. The legis-
lative branch prevents the concentra-
tion of power by saying to the chief ex-
ecutive officer: Mr. Chief Executive Of-
ficer, you are out of balance. You are
assuming more authority than the
Constitution accords you. Because you
cannot do this, we, the Members of the
legislative branch, can bring you before
the bar of justice. We can call on you
to answer for your failure to honor
lawful investigative requests of the
legislative branch. So we bring you be-
fore the bar of justice, and that is
called impeachment.
But it is important to remember that
the Framers of the Constitution put
the system of checks and balances in
place to prevent a concentration of
power. Why would we want to prevent
a concentration of power? Because if
the chief executive officer, the Presi-
dent, is allowed to have power con-
centrated beyond what the Constitu-
tion accords, meaning there are no
guardrails, the President can do what-
ever he chooses.
The President then becomes an offi-
cer who is and can be above the law. He
is above the law in this country. No
person is above the law. The checks
and balances are in place to prevent
the President from being above the
law.
If we don’t enforce this system of
checks and balances, we then allow the
concentration of power, and we no
longer have the form of government
that the Framers intended and that we
have enjoyed for these many years.
We would have a monarchy. We
would have a monarch. A monarch has
the power to do whatever he chooses.
The monarch is the law.
We never intended in this country for
the chief executive officer, the Presi-
dent, to be the law. We intended for the
President to enforce the law by and
through the various agencies that are
under his domain, if you will, but not
to be the law itself, not to decide what
the law is on any given day, not to de-
cide that he will obey the law when he
chooses. No one is above the law.
The Mueller report is a good indica-
tion of how the law is viewed. The
Mueller report indicates that there are
many instances where, but for a rule
that the Justice Department adheres
to, the President would be indicted—
but for this rule.
You won’t find the words stated ex-
actly as I have stated them, but that is
the essence of what is stated in the
Mueller report as it relates to obstruc-
tion of justice. Mr. Mueller was as-
signed the responsibility of looking
into certain aspects of the campaign
that the President participated in be-
fore being elected and to ascertain
whether or not there was some collu-
sion, obstruction of justice, if you will.
b 1815
The Mueller conclusion is that the
President is not exonerated when it
comes to obstruction of justice and
that the President but for these rules
that they have, this rule that says you
don’t indict a sitting President, the
President would likely be indicted. I
say, likely be, because Mr. Mueller
didn’t say he would be, but he did say
that the President wasn’t exonerated
when it comes to obstruction of jus-
tice.
So the President is not above the
law, and if the Justice Department is
not going to prosecute, then where is
the bar of justice?
It is here. It is right here in this
room; this very august body that we
call the Congress of the United States
of America. We then have the responsi-
bility. If the Justice Department is not
going to pursue the President, then it
is left to the Congress. This is the last
alternative for ensuring that the
checks and balances are maintained
and that the President is not above the
law.
Who agrees with the Mueller Report
as I have expressed it?
Some 800 former prosecutors have in-
dicated that if this were any other per-
son who violated the law as they see it
in the Mueller Report, that this person
would be prosecuted. They go on to say
that it is critical that obstruction of
justice be prosecuted because if you do
not, then what you are sending is a
message to people that they can inter-
fere with lawful investigations. They
don’t say it in those exact words, but
that is the import of the message that
they do share with us, some 800 pros-
ecutors, Federal prosecutors, persons
who understand this law.
Many of them have said that there is
more than enough evidence here to
prosecute anyone other than the Presi-
dent. But they have been respectful,
and they understand that there is a
rule in the Justice Department—the
Office of Legal Counsel has promul-
gated it—that indicates that a sitting
President won’t be prosecuted.
If the sitting President is not going
to be prosecuted, then these 800 law-
yers are saying to us that the bar of
justice has to be the place where the
President will be brought, and that bar
of justice is here in the House of Rep-
resentatives. No one is above the law.
We now recognize that we are some
34 days since the Mueller Report was
made public. This is the number of
days that the Trump administration
has been above the law, some 34 days.
Why?
Because we have one official in the
administration who has refused to
honor a lawful request by the Ways and
Means Committee to produce certain
records, certain records belonging to
the President, tax records—refused to
produce those records in contravention
of the law. Another official, the person
who heads the Justice Department, is
declining to respond to requests of the
Judiciary Committee.
No one is above the law. So we now
have not only the President refusing,
but the persons who are part of the ad-
ministration are refusing. Some 34
days now I would say the administra-
tion itself has been above the law.
These are the days since the Mueller
Report has been released to the public,
the number of days the Trump admin-
istration has been above the law.
I love my country. I never came to
Congress to give the speech I am giving
tonight. I didn’t come to Congress to
take on the most powerful person on
the planet Earth. I find myself stand-
ing here because I believe that you can-
not see that this moral imperative ex-
ists to make sure that the law is fol-
lowed and treated the same as it re-
lates to all people and then ignore it. I
just don’t see how you can do it. I can-
not. I refuse to ignore the fact that the
President has obstructed justice.
The President is not above the law.
No one is. I will not allow political ex-
pediency, this notion that rather than
deal with this now, let’s just wait and
let the next election determine the fate
of a person who has breached the law in
the highest office of the land, I might
add. I refuse to accept it. I just cannot.
The President is not above the law. I
didn’t come to the Congress to say
this, but I love my country, and I see
what this is doing to the country, when
we have the chief executive officer say-
ing to law enforcement officers—and he
did say what I am about to tell you—
that you don’t have to be nice when
you arrest people.
What message are you sending to
them in terms of what their behavior
should be when they take people into
their care, custody, and control?
You are saying to them you can
break the law.

you say to people: Don’t worry about
how you treat them; if they arrest you,
I will take care of it?
That wasn’t the exact language, but
that was the message. This is the chief
executive officer. This is the person
who is the standard-bearer for the
United States of America—the stand-
ard-bearer, the person who carries the
torch of freedom for the United States
of America.
What are you saying when you say
that you are a person who would sup-
port the breaking of the law and then
you would support defending the per-
son who breaks the law?
You are saying you are above the law
and you believe it, and you are saying
you are willing to take care of those
who would break the law as well.
We have seen circumstances in this
country that I never thought we would
see: a President sending messages and
signals indicating that if you side with
me, I have the magic wand. If you side
with me, I have the power to erase
your offenses, your crimes. It is not
really erasing, but I am commu-
nicating that it is a pardon. The Presi-
dent has this power, and he sends sig-
nals: break the law, but worry not, I
have your back.
Is this what we expect from the high-
est office in the land in the greatest
country in the world?
Are we going to allow ourselves to be
brought into this complicity that we
see so many people succumbing to?
I don’t think so. I will not. We can-
not allow ourselves to become
complicit. We cannot allow ourselves
to become a party to what is going on
here. The mere fact that we stand si-
lent on it, as Dr. King put it: at some
point, silence in and of itself becomes
betrayal.
The silence is betraying our country,
it is betraying the Constitution, and it
is betraying the Republic. The si-
lence—no one is above the law.
When will we cease to be silent on
the greatest issue confronting us at
this time?
The Republic is at stake. It is not
about Republicans, it is about the Re-
public and whether we will maintain it.
It is not about Democrats, it is about
our democracy. This is bigger than all
of us. It is bigger. It is bigger than the
President. It is about the country we
love and whether we are going to allow
one person to destroy the concept of no
one being above the law.
It is bigger than we are, and the
truth is it has now become an issue
that is about Congress. This issue is
now about Congress. It is about wheth-
er the Congress of the United States of
America is going to fulfill its responsi-
bility. It is about whether the Congress
of the United States of America will
see and say—see that the President is
obstructing and say that the President
is obstructing.
I marvel at the number of Members
of Congress who have said that the
President is obstructing justice, who
have said that the President has com-
mitted impeachable offenses, impeach-
able acts, but notwithstanding having
said it will not say that the President
ought to be impeached. There are some
who say that he should be impeached
as a matter of fact and still won’t move
to impeach him.
The President is not above the law.
We are the law, the Members of Con-
gress, 435 of us. We have been given an
awesome responsibility. It is awesome.
I don’t take it lightly. It is not some-
thing that I think everybody should
have the responsibility accorded to
them because there are a good many
people who don’t believe that you
should prosecute a President. They
think that if the President commits a
crime, well, that is the President. I am
not one of them.
They think that you have to commit
a crime, by the way, before you can be
impeached, a good many people. I am
not one of them. The President doesn’t
have to commit a crime to be im-
peached. It is the harm that he causes
society that the Framers of the Con-
stitution addressed in Federalist 65,
the words of Madison, Jay, and Ham-
ilton.
The President is not above the law.
We in this body are now the issue. The
issue is: Will Congress do what the
Constitution has given us as the means
by which we can deal with a chief exec-
utive officer who is breaking the law,
who sees himself, apparently by virtue
of his behavior, as being above the law?
This is what Congress has to look
into. This is what Congress has to
bring before the bar of justice, this
whole notion that the President is not
above the law.
So let’s just take a moment now and
talk about the process of impeachment
because a good many people don’t un-
derstand. Impeachment does not mean
that a President is removed from of-
fice. Impeachment is sort of like an in-
dictment. It is not the same but very
much similar to an indictment. The
Members of the House of Representa-
tives serve as a body very similar to a
grand jury. It is not the same, but it is
similar to a grand jury. The Members
of the House of Representatives deter-
mine whether or not a President should
be impeached. They do so with a vote,
a majority of the House voting to im-
peach, and the President is impeached.
The President doesn’t have to com-
mit a crime to be impeached. Andrew
Johnson was impeached in 1868. Article
10 of the articles of impeachment
against him for a high misdemeanor
that was not a crime—a misdemeanor
is a misdeed, aside from being a minor
criminal offense it is also a misdeed.
He was impeached for this misdeed, and
we here in this body can impeach any
President for misdeeds.
So if the body impeaches, it doesn’t
mean that the President is removed
from office. It simply means that the
President must now go to trial in the
Senate. There is no requirement in the
Constitution for the House to have to
investigate the Mueller Report. The
Mueller Report has been shared with
us. There is enough evidence in that re-
port to impeach the President. The
Mueller Report has evidence shared by
virtue of talking to witnesses who gave
their testimony under the penalty of
perjury. We can use that as the rea-
son—that report—to send this to the
Senate where a trial will take place.
Remember, impeachment is sort of
like an indictment—not the same but
similar. It goes to the Senate. The
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
would preside over that trial—the Chief
Justice.
In so doing, the House will have per-
sons called managers. These managers
would act as prosecutors. They would
bring evidence before the Senate for
the Senate to act upon. The Senate
acts upon the evidence. The Chief Jus-
tice is there to make sure certain rules
are followed. For example, if the House
prosecutors, the managers, if they
would like to call a witness, the Chief
Justice will then be there to assist the
process to get that witness before the
Senate.
There is a trial. Witnesses are called.
Subpoenas can be issued, and you don’t
have to meander through some lower
courts, inferior courts, because all
courts, when it comes to the impeach-
ment of the President, are inferior to
the Senate when it sits in trial of the
President.
b 1830
They are all inferior, all of the
courts.
So you have the Chief Justice there
to make his ruling. All of this is done
before the public. There will be a trial.
All of these subpoenas that are not
being honored, all of the witnesses that
are refusing to testify, take them be-
fore the Senate. Call them; have them
sworn; have them give their testimony;
and let the world hear and see.
There is a desire to have a trial be-
fore the trial in the House, to have a
trial in the sense that witnesses come
and appear and are a part of an inves-
tigation. That is not, in fact, the kind
of trial that you think of when you
think of the word ‘‘trial,’’ but in a
sense, we are having the witnesses
come in and give their testimony.
There is a desire to do this.
To be very honest with you, I am not
antithetical to the idea, but I do under-
stand that, if the witnesses are not
coming, if the subpoenas are not being
honored, then the option left to us is to
impeach and have that trial in the Sen-
ate, where they will have to come. Sub-
poenas will have to be honored. That is
the means by which we maintain the
system of checks and balances when
the President refuses to perform as ex-
pected under the Constitution—as a
matter of fact, as required under the
Constitution.
So, given that the President is not
following the norms and not following
the law and eventually we could take
this through the inferior courts—they
are inferior to the Senate when it sits

in trial of the President, because that
is the ultimate court related to issues
related to the President.
These things can meander through
the inferior courts. They are not infe-
rior in the sense that they are less than
efficient and effective at what they do;
they are just inferior to this impeach-
ment trial when the President has been
impeached, the trial to determine
whether or not he should be removed
from office. Impeachment doesn’t re-
move the President from office.
But these subpoenas and all of these
issues can go through these courts. No
one knows how long it will take, but
everybody prognosticates, people who
know and who are supposed to know,
that it can take months. It can take
months, which means that we will, at
some point, engage in paralysis anal-
ysis.
Dr. King called it the paralysis of
analysis, but analysis paralysis, mean-
ing this: We will have done all that we
can in these courts to try to bring the
President to justice, get the witnesses
necessary to bring the President to jus-
tice because he has committed these
impeachable acts, and at some point,
you will get so close to an election that
someone will say: Well, let’s not do
this. Let’s just wait until the next elec-
tion.
We will have been paralyzed going
through the courts such that we won’t
get to the issues in time, and, as a mat-
ter of fact, it could be after the next
election before some of the courts will
rule. We just don’t know. But those
who prognosticate say that it will be
months.
One would think that maybe there
can be an expedited process, but the
courts will determine whether this will
be the case.
So, when you have all of this and you
are confronting all of these things, you
have to ask yourself: Will the House of
Representatives do its job?
And for those who are saying, well,
you have to have bipartisan support, I
would love to see bipartisan support,
but there is no requirement for it in
the Constitution.
As a matter of fact, Jay, Hamilton,
Madison, they prognosticated that you
would not have unanimity. You won’t
have the bipartisanship that you are
looking for. They said it would be a
time of strife. They indicated that peo-
ple would separate along party lines.
Read Federalist 65, not a long read.
Read it. You will see. They prognos-
ticated that there would be divisions.
So to say you have got to have the Re-
publican Party on board before the
Democratic Party can do its job is in-
correct—not required.
And, by the way, history is not going
to be kind. It is not going to be kind.
History is not going to be kind to us.
History is going to cause a lot of rep-
utations to be soiled. Those who look
through the vista of time are not going
to side with us the way we have friend-
ships and relationships siding with us
now.
History is not going to be kind to
Democrats or Republicans. History is
going to present us as people who saw
an injustice in the highest office of the
land and refused to do our jobs.
It won’t be kind to us. Reputations
are going to be tarnished. People who
will be saluted and proclaimed heroes
today who were just waiting to do the
right thing at the right time, history is
not going to be kind to them. There are
too many things on record that they
have already said. And there are too
many people who will go back through
these records, videos of what they have
said.
They can walk it back now, and they
can have friendships now that will be
of assistance to them, but history is
not going to be kind to them.
But there is a means by which we can
bring ourselves back in proper align-
ment with the Constitution. It is called
impeachment. This is what we can do,
and it is never too late to get on the
right side of history.
There are many people in this House
who are on the wrong side of history,
wrong side of history. The right side of
politics, as they see it. I would rather
be on the right side of history and the
wrong side of politics.
So these persons who are now on the
wrong side of history, my hope is that
they will do as I see many of my col-
leagues doing now, and they are com-
ing forward and they are acknowl-
edging that enough is enough. Im-
peachment is a solution that has to be
pursued.
The question no longer is who is
going to be the first to engage in this
notion that we have to bring the Presi-
dent before the bar of justice in the
House of Representatives. This is not
the question.
The question now is who will be the
last person to say we must do it, be-
cause there seems to be a momentum
building. There seems to be a momen-
tum building that is going to cause
some people who would have made his-
tory to be made by history.
History can make people, and people
can make history. There are some peo-
ple who are going to be proclaimed by
our contemporaries now as having
made history, but the truth is that his-
tory will make them. History will
make them do what they should do and
should have done.
They are going to have to face his-
tory. Maybe not right away, but, I as-
sure you, time always tells. The truth
is known, and history always judges.
We are going to be judged, my
friends. We all are. We are going to be
judged. So why don’t we just get on the
right side of history now and salvage
some of the reputation that we have?
They don’t have to lose their entire
reputation. They don’t have to become
adamant about this. They have made
their point. Let it go. Get on the right
side of history. We know where this is
going. It is just a matter of time.
There will be additional votes on im-
peachment right here on this floor of
the House of Representatives. Be on
the right side of history for our chil-
dren, for our grandchildren, for our
great-grandchildren, for unborn gen-
erations. Get on the right side of his-
tory.
Yes, history will have made them,
but they will have made the right deci-
sion.
History makes people; people make
history. Either way, be on the right
side of history. Don’t find yourself on
the wrong side of history when you
hold yourself out to be a person who
adheres to moral authority, the moral
imperative to do the right thing. Be on
the right side of history.
I have heard people say that the soul
of the country is at risk. I concur. But
I also say this: Before the soul of the
country goes, the soul of the House of
Representatives will have gone, the
soul of the House of Representatives,
the very soul that we have in our
hands, that has the moral authority,
the moral imperative, to go forward
and not allow political expediency to
jeopardize our duty to do that which
the Constitution affords us the oppor-
tunity to do if we have but only the
will to do it.
This House is now on trial. The
House of Representatives is on trial in
the court of public opinion. Some
would say: Well, the court is not unani-
mously opposed. Some 40-plus percent
of persons say that impeachment is ap-
propriate.
The public is here today and there to-
morrow. The public has no duty to stay
in one place all the time. We are look-
ing at a snapshot in time, and the pub-
lic opinion will change. It does.
When Nixon was first brought before
the attention of the Senate, as they
were investigating, public opinion was
not such that it would call for his im-
peachment then. Public opinion
changes.
I have a great example—unrelated to
impeachment, but a great example.
I remember when we had to vote on
what has been called the ‘‘bailout.’’ I
remember the calls to my office. Peo-
ple knew that we were about to, as
they saw it, bail out the banks, and the
calls were very strong.
People called in in large numbers,
saying: Don’t you vote to bail out
those banks. Don’t you do it. If you do
it—there was at least one caller, prob-
ably more, who said—we will run you
out of town.
Well, I remember standing in the
back of the Chamber, and as I stood
there, after having cast my vote
against the bailout, I saw the votes go
up and the stock market go down.
And having done what I thought was
the appropriate thing pursuant to the
requests of my constituents, I could
not wait to hear what the response
would be the next day.
The response the next day was: What
is wrong with you? Don’t you see what
you have done to my 401(k)? What is
wrong with you? We are going to run
you out of town.

I learned a lesson about public opin-
ion. Public opinion can be in one place
today and in an entirely different place
tomorrow.
We should do what we believe is the
right thing based upon what our con-
science dictates. That is what I do.
I assure you, this is a question of
conscience for me, and I am going to
follow my conscience, and I will have
done the right thing.
Dr. King said there are times when
you have to do that which is neither
safe, nor politic, nor popular. You do it
because it is right.
I am going to do the right thing be-
cause conscience dictates that this is
the right thing to do.
Madam Speaker, 34 days the Presi-
dent, the administration, is above the
law—34 days.
But there is one other thing. There
are some things that are indelible,
some things that you can’t get out of
your mind, some things that you just
can’t reconcile within yourself.
This baby—and we have all seen this
picture, or a good many of us have—
crying, being separated from a parent—
babies—at the border. I don’t know the
people. I know that they are part of the
same race that I am a part of, the
human race. I know that I have a kin-
ship and a relationship with them.
For our executive office to promul-
gate a policy, produce a policy that
separates babies from their parents and
not have a means by which they can be
reunited is sinful.
Babies separated from their parents
and no means of reuniting them in
place at the time you make this sepa-
ration?
b 1845
This is indelible in my mind. There
are many other things to think about,
but this I think about a lot, how we
have treated people who are coming to
this country who mean us no harm but
who are trying to escape harm’s way. I
cannot divorce myself from it.
I don’t know them. I just know that
they are human beings.
I know that there is a crisis at the
border. I think we have to deal with it.
I want to deal with the border crisis.
But I don’t think separating children
from their parents, as we have done it,
is a part of the solution.
I think that persons who would do
this are victims. Those Border Patrol
officers are victims themselves for
what they have to do. Many of them,
they don’t want to do some of the
things that they are being forced to do.
They, too, are victims.
But it started at the top. It started
at the top with a belief that somehow
this would deter people from coming,
people who are fleeing harm’s way.
I only say to people as it relates to
me. I say to myself, but for the grace of
God, I could be one of these people. I
was just fortunate enough to be born in
this country, in a country where there
are great opportunities. But for the
grace of God, it could be me.
Why would I treat someone with this
level of indignity? But for the grace of
God, it could be me.
I refuse to let this go. I believe that
this, too, is a part of the overall ration-
ale for impeachment.
Madam Speaker, this is our watch.
This is the watch that has been af-
forded us. To every woman and man, a
watch is given, and this is our watch.
We can do as best we can to reconcile
in our minds that this is okay, that it
is all right. But in our hearts, we can’t
reconcile it. The mind can reconcile it,
but the heart cannot.
My heart won’t let this be reconciled.
In my mind, it is indelible.
I say that, on my watch, I want the
RECORD to show that I took a stand.
Even when I had to stand alone, I took
a stand. It is better to stand alone than
not stand at all.
But there are others who are stand-
ing, and I believe there will be many
more, one of whom happens to be on
the opposite side of the aisle. I thank
him for having courage.
I know what is going to happen. He is
going to be ridiculed, but don’t let that
become the final word. When the pages
of history are properly written, he will
be vindicated. He will be vindicated. I
assure him, my dear brother, he will be
vindicated.
I don’t know him. I have never en-
couraged him to do anything. Nobody
can say that he and I have any kind of
friendship, really, other than I believe
that all of us have collegiality and that
we ought to be friendly with each
other.
But he is going to be vindicated. Stay
strong. People are going to say ugly
things. He may even get threats. But
stay strong, because he is on the right
side of history.
More importantly, he is on the right
side of righteousness. The right side of
righteousness, what a great place to be.
Don’t let the head convince you that
the heart is wrong. The heart speaks to
the soul, to your very being. The head
speaks to those who would listen to
you. Let your heart speak to you.
Madam Speaker, I pray that we, in
this House, will do that which the Con-
stitution and the Framers of the Con-
stitution have given us the opportunity
to do in a time such as this with a
President such as Trump.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the

ADDRESSING THE IMMIGRATION
CRISIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
minority leader.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to address what I think is
the most pressing issue in America
right now. But prior to addressing it, I
yield to the gentlewoman from North
Carolina (Ms. FOXX).
CONGRATULATING SAMARITAN’S PURSE ON NEW
MINISTRY CENTER IN NORTH WILKESBORO,
NORTH CAROLINA
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise to congratulate Samari-
tan’s Purse, an international Christian
relief organization headquartered in
Boone, North Carolina, on its expan-
sion in North Wilkesboro.
This inspiring organization has been
providing spiritual and physical aid to
impoverished victims of war, disease,
famine, and natural disaster since 1970.
The new North Wilkesboro Ministry
Center will serve as a lifeline to remote
missions in developing countries. It
will house inventory from World Med-
ical Mission, including lifesaving med-
ical supplies and an emergency field
hospital.
This expansion and the wide-reaching
vision of Samaritan’s Purse would not
be possible without the hardworking
and dedicated staff behind it. These
great humanitarians are an honor to
represent, and I know that they are
wonderful ambassadors of North Caro-
lina’s Fifth District around the world.
CONGRATULATING NORTH WILKES AND WEST
WILKES MIDDLE SCHOOLS ON LIGHTHOUSE CER-
TIFICATION
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize North
Wilkes Middle School and West Wilkes
Middle School in North Carolina’s
Fifth District on their recent achieve-
ment of Lighthouse certification for
implementing the Leader in Me pro-
gram. Lighthouse certification is the
highest recognition awarded by the
FranklinCovey institute, and these are
the first schools to receive this distinc-
tion in our State.
I commend the schools’ administra-
tion, staff, and students for embracing
new paradigms of leadership and under-
taking the comprehensive school im-
provement model put forth by the
Leadership in Me program. The pro-
gram aims to provide a holistic edu-
cation that encompasses leadership, a
culture of student empowerment, and
academic achievement.
Congratulations to North Wilkes
Middle School and West Wilkes Middle
School for their demonstrated success.
The high-achieving students are evi-
dence of how effectively local leaders
in Wilkes County foster positive re-
sults with innovation in education.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker,
prior to addressing the immigration
crisis, which is the biggest problem, I
think, facing America today, after
hearing a rather lengthy speech before
mine, I was analyzing the well here and
noticing the flag of the United States
of America behind me. As I am looking
at that flag, I couldn’t help but think
about the Pledge of Allegiance.
The Pledge of Allegiance begins: ‘‘I
pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the
Republic for which it stands.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4059
May 21, 2019
I pondered why that Pledge of Alle-
giance refers to this country as a re-
public instead of a democracy of which
it stands. I think it would be a good
thing for the other Congressmen up
here to think about that as well.
There have been several versions of
the Pledge of Allegiance. In each one of
the versions, while there are changes
made, it refers to our country as a re-
public instead of a democracy. We
should wonder why that is, and I think
every Congressman should read up on
the difference.
Now, the reason I am here today is to
discuss what I think is the biggest
problem in the United States of Amer-
ica, the one thing we have to deal with
in the immediate future and something
that I believe does not grab the atten-
tion of Congress the way it should, and
that is the immigration crisis.
One more time, another month will
go by, and another 100,000 people will
enter this country not at the des-
ignated points of entry. We believe an-
other 10,000 people will enter at the
points of entry and claim asylum,
whether they actually need asylum or
not.
No country can afford to have over
100,000 people pour into that country
month after month after month with-
out being appropriately vetted, step-
ping in line ahead of the people who are
doing what is appropriate to become a
citizen of the United States or appro-
priate to get a work visa in the United
States.
Ultimately, this will destroy our
country, and it is something that this
Congress should be dealing with imme-
diately.
I think it is a little embarrassing,
hearing all the other speeches up here
and no speeches about the immigration
crisis.
I want to point out, neither I nor
President Trump wants to reduce the
700,000 people who are sworn in as citi-
zens in this country every year, neither
do we want to deal with the 4 million
work permits that people in this coun-
try already have. Neither are they
overly concerned that we, right now,
have the highest number of foreign-
born people in this country as a per-
centage of our total population since
World War I.
Now, what are we going to do about
this crisis? Because, obviously, be it
culturally, be it fiscally, we cannot
allow this to go on any further.
The first thing I think President
Trump should do is end birthright citi-
zenship. To say that if you come here,
and particularly given that we allow
entire families to stay once somebody
is a citizen, to continue to allow the
situation to happen in which, if you
come here, whether you come in not at
a designated point of entry, whether
you come here flying in on a jet plane,
in the United States of America, a
newly born child becomes a citizen.
We and Canada are the only two
countries of the 40 wealthiest countries
in the world per capita that allow this
birthright citizenship to continue.
I know President Trump understands
this problem very well. He understands
very well, as some Members of Con-
gress do not, that the amendment to
the Constitution that talks about peo-
ple being born in this country becom-
ing citizens was meant to deal with
slavery, not meant to deal with any-
body who comes here.
I strongly urge President Trump to
step up and do something that he
talked about doing during his cam-
paign, and that is ending birthright
citizenship.
In addition to the fact that it is
wrong on its face, as long as you have
birthright citizenship, it encourages
people to come here, even illegally,
knowing that if they have a child here,
it will create a situation in which there
is a good chance the rest of the family
will follow.
The next thing I think we can do is
put immigration judges on the border.
Right now, people are showing up, and
they are asking for asylum. They are
given a court date 5 years down the
line.
Well, who knows whether they will
be around in 5 years. They probably
will not show up for the court date at
that time.
I strongly encourage President
Trump to put judges on the border so
we can immediately judge whether
these people are entitled to asylum or
not.
The next thing, along the same lines,
I strongly encourage the Border Patrol
to be trained to judge credible fear.
Again, we believe that there are people
coming from other countries who claim
they have a credible fear who do not
meet that standard as far as coming to
the United States. We know that peo-
ple are being coached as to what to say
to come into this country. By training
our Border Patrol to deal with these
issues, we will not have so many people
coming into the country illegally.
The next thing I strongly think that
President Trump should do is he should
have ICE round up the million people
who already have orders to be de-
ported. This should be a relatively sim-
ple matter. By deporting some people,
it sends the message to people in other
countries that the United States will
take our immigration laws seriously.
Today, to a certain extent, because
far too many politicians are encour-
aging things like sanctuary cities, get-
ting rid of ICE, talking about giving
public benefits to people who are here
illegally, it is not surprising that peo-
ple in other countries are getting the
message that the United States does
not treat its immigration laws seri-
ously.
The next thing I think we ought to
do is I hope President Trump expedites
the rule in the Department of Home-
land Security dealing with allowing for
removal of people who are taking ad-
vantage of public assistance.
b 1900
Obviously, the United States cannot
become the welfare magnet for the en-
tire Western Hemisphere. Everybody
knows that, while it is frequently ille-
gal, many people who are here illegally
are taking advantage of public assist-
ance, and we should expedite the legal
ability to remove these people.
I would like to take a pause here to
congratulate Secretary Ben Carson for
removing illegals from public housing.
I will point out something a lot of
people don’t know. Frequently, under
Section 8 or, even more, under section
42, the housing assistance they get
from the government gives people
housing that is superior to what many
of the working people get. It is even
more ridiculous when people who are
here illegally get housing superior to
what many of the native-born people in
this country who rent are receiving.
So I would like to thank Secretary
Carson for having the ability to step up
and begin to take a stand on the idea
that, if you come here illegally, you
should get free or reduced housing.
The next thing I would like to see
this House take up is sanctuary cities.
I have introduced H.R. 516, which takes
away grants from State and local units
of government that become sanctuary
cities.
There are a variety of problems with
sanctuary cities. First of all, it encour-
ages people to go to those cities to get
some sort of welfare benefit.
Secondly, whenever a mayor or a
Governor wants to declare their city or
State a sanctuary city, it sends the
message that the United States is not
going to enforce its immigration laws.
As long as that message is out here,
people will continue to flow into our
country, and it will eventually be the
end of the United States.
The next thing I want this body to do
is pass H.R. 848, another bill of mine.
The purpose of that bill is to increase
the verification for compliance on any
welfare benefits which people who are
not in this country could be receiving.
We are also saying that anybody who is
not a citizen of this country should not
receive any public assistance, which
should be common sense.
If you are coming here for an oppor-
tunity and you are not able to find a
job, even if you are coming here le-
gally, the answer is not to have the
American taxpayer who is already $23
trillion in debt pick up the tab. The an-
swer is, if you cannot find opportunity
in this country, return to your country
of origin.
I hope this body, which is spending so
much time dealing with less important
issues, takes up this bill in the near fu-
ture.
Finally, I ask President Trump to
continue to work towards the wall. I
ask this Congress, as we move appro-
priation bills out, to make sure that
wall is funded.
I have been down on the border. I did
not find any Border Patrol agents who
were embarrassed to do their job or
didn’t want to do their job. The Border
Patrol agents that I talked to on the
Arizona-Mexico border felt we des-
perately needed a wall. They realize

that walls work in other countries, and
they realize that in the long- or even in
the short-term, walls would save us a
lot of money.
Right now, different estimates vary
between $50 billion, $100 billion a year
is lost because of illegal immigration.
Given the cost of a wall would be under
$10 billion, it would be a big cost sav-
ings. And for a country that is $23 tril-
lion in debt, we need big cost savings.
In any event, those are suggestions of
some of the things we can do to deal
with this crisis.
Think about it: 100,000 people coming
here every month, people unvetted,
people who may wind up on welfare,
people who may wind up having a
criminal record, and all coming here
skipping ahead in line of those people
who have sometimes waited 5 or 10
years to come here legally, which is in-
credibly unfair to them.
In any event, I hope Congress begins
to act on these measures. I encourage
President Trump to make border en-
forcement his number one priority over
the next couple months, because we
can see it. It is very difficult to remove
any of these people once they come to
this country.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE CENTENNIAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. HILL) is recognized for the
remainder of the hour as the designee
of the minority leader.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to
the historic vote taken exactly 100
years ago when this body passed the
19th Amendment, giving women the
right to vote.
The most powerful tool we have is to
share our voice, cast our ballot, and ex-
ercise our right to vote. This momen-
tous vote finally allowed women to use
that tool and forever have a voice in
the future of our beloved Nation.
Adolphine Fletcher Terry, a civic-
minded woman from a prominent Lit-
tle Rock family in the late 1800s and
early 20th century, served her State
and her country tirelessly to promote
the education of women and women’s
rights. Terry marched for voting rights
for women during the ratification proc-
ess in 1920, saying: ‘‘To me, the vote
represents more than just saying how a
person feels about an issue or a can-
didate. It represents human dignity
and the fact that a citizen can express
his or her opinion on any subject with-
out fear of reprisal. That, I think, is
what real human dignity consists of.’’
In advance of the final State’s ratifi-
cation vote in Tennessee, both suffra-
gists and antisuffragists began wearing
roses to identify their respective sides.
Those favoring women’s voting rights
wore yellow roses; those against wore
red roses. I proudly, today, have worn a
yellow rose on my lapel throughout to-
day’s activities to show my support of
women’s right to vote.
What a thrill it is and a proud thing
to say, thank you, Madam Speaker, for
your service.
FENTANYL SANCTIONS
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, across Arkansas, heartbroken
families have told me of their stories
about the opioid crisis and how it has
claimed the lives of their loved ones.
We can’t allow more families to be de-
stroyed by this truly national night-
mare that is killing more than 130
Americans every day.
Furthermore, the Centers for Disease
Control reported that fentanyl is now
considered the number one U.S. opioid
killer in 2018. Targeting the source of
the world’s largest producers and dis-
tributors of fentanyl will begin to stop
the flow of these drugs coming across
our borders and onto our streets.
Madam Speaker, in just one Sweet’N
Low packet, about a gram, an equal
amount of this as fentanyl has the
power to kill 500 of our citizens. That is
why I am pleased to support the bipar-
tisan legislation that I recently helped
introduce, H.R. 2483, the Fentanyl
Sanctions Act. This takes the nec-
essary steps to target the bad actors
responsible for illegally trafficking
fentanyl into the United States.
I applaud my colleagues MAX ROSE of
New York, ANTHONY BRINDISI of New
York, and BRIAN FITZPATRICK of Penn-
sylvania for their support in intro-
ducing H.R. 2483.
This legislation is the first ever
fentanyl sanctions effort by the House
of Representatives. It will apply pres-
sure on the Chinese Government to
honor their commitment to make all
fentanyl illegal in China. This bill will
also provide the United States with
more tools and resources to go after il-
licit traffickers in China, Mexico, and
other countries.
H.R. 2483 has support from both par-
ties and both Chambers, and we need to
act now in order to get this done. We
cannot wait any longer.
ASSOCIATION OF MILITARY BANKS OF AMERICA
60TH ANNIVERSARY
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, today I rise to congratulate
the 60th anniversary of the Association
of Military Banks of America.
Just as they did back in 1959, mili-
tary banks today consider themselves
privileged to provide financial services,
support, and education to the military
and veteran communities across this
country.
I am particularly proud that First
Arkansas Bank and Trust, which serves
our airmen and -women at Little Rock
Air Force Base, is one of these military
banks.
On base, financial institutions have
proven to be the single best sources of
financial education and support avail-
able to our troops. They ease financial
burdens and stress faced by our troops
and their families so that they can
focus on their mission of protecting
our great Nation.
Congratulations on 60 years of serv-
ing the financial needs of our Nation’s
heroes.
COURT SECURITY OFFICER OF THE YEAR, JIMMY
HOWINGTON
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
life of a security officer who continues
to have an indelible impact on my
State of Arkansas, Mr. Jimmy
Howington, who this year was the
Court Security Officer of the Year.
Jimmy is one of 33 court security of-
ficers in Arkansas and serves under the
jurisdiction of the Eighth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
He was chosen for the award from
roughly 600 court security officers
working in 30 courthouses in the seven
States within the Eighth Circuit’s ju-
risdiction.
Jimmy was recommended for this
honor for noticing and investigating
two suspicious situations on court-
house property during a period of sev-
eral bomb threats at Little Rock’s
Richard Sheppard Arnold U.S. Court-
house, where he has worked since 2016.
A former state trooper and sergeant
major in the United States Marine
Corps Reserve, Jimmy’s life of service
makes him well deserving of this
award.
I would like to extend a hand of grat-
itude and congratulations to him for
his selfless service to Arkansas and our
Nation.
BRIGADIER GENERAL PAUL ROWLETT
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the ac-
complishments and to congratulate
Brigadier General Paul Rowlett, who
recently was promoted to brigadier
general of the Arkansas Air National
Guard.
Rowlett is a native of Salem, Arkan-
sas, and as a brigadier general will
serve as the chief of staff for the Ar-
kansas Air National Guard.
He joined the military in 1988 and is
currently an intelligence officer with
the National Guard and works with re-
mote-piloted aircraft. His duties in-
clude strategic planning on current and
future missions.
Rowlett has been assigned to Active-
Duty positions throughout his career,
including locations such as Guanta-
namo Bay, and recently he has been as-
signed to Little Rock Air Force Base
for the majority of the time since 2001.
He has become one of only three gen-
eral officers in Arkansas.
My congratulations and best wishes
for Brigadier General Rowlett and his
bright future defending our beloved Na-
tion.
NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM EMPLOYEE

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam

tional Wildlife Refuge Complex for

uge System Employee of the Year by
the National Wildlife Refuge Associa-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4061
May 21, 2019
Eric is an administrative forester
that is in charge of restoring and man-
aging some 90,000 acres of forested
habitat for waterfowl and migratory
birds in the lower Mississippi Valley.
While protecting this extensive acre-
age, he developed the Nation’s first
Spatial Habitat Management Plan.
This plan will serve as a new national
standard for refuge systems and pro-
tect all of Arkansas’ five refuges, in-
cluding Bald Knob’s Wildlife Refuge in
my district.
His service to the State of Arkansas
and to wildlife conservation will not be
forgotten, and I join all Arkansans in
congratulating Eric on this recognition
and wish him much continued success.
U.S. POLICY IN SYRIA
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to speak out
against the daily atrocities in Syria.
Few would have predicted that 8
years ago peaceful protests would turn
into violent conflict that has left more
than half a million men, women, and
children dead, millions more displaced,
and the entire region feeling like a lit
fuse ready to explode into further con-
flict.
Shortly after coming to Congress, I
met Mouaz Moustafa, a young Syrian
American from Arkansas who has been
leading a Syrian pro-democracy group
here in Washington called the Syrian
Emergency Task Force.
After meeting Mouaz, I studied his
efforts and learned more and more
about the horrific events happening in
Syria over the past few years.
b 1915
Mouaz led me through the Caesar file
photos in a special exhibit at the
United States Holocaust Memorial Mu-
seum. Earlier this year, he introduced
me to Omar Alshogre, who was ar-
rested as a teenager and survived the
torture, starvation, and other brutal-
ities in Assad’s prisons for more than 3
years. Seeing those photos and hearing
Omar’s personal testimony were power-
ful experiences.
I believe what is happening in Syria
today is a modern-day holocaust, and
our obligation to end Assad’s reign of
terror is something that all Americans
must confront.
I am grateful for The New York
Times and its recent extensive front-
page story, in last Sunday’s newspaper,
going inside Assad’s torture prisons.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD a link to this article:
www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/
middleeast/syria -torture-prisons.html
Madam Speaker, it is the experiences
shared by former prisoners like Omar
that remind us of the likes of Hitler,
Mao, and Stalin. Bashar al-Assad can
add his name to this list of barbarous
thugs who rule with evil, torture, and
mass murder.
We have known about these atroc-
ities for years but have only expressed
outrage while we twiddled our thumbs
as these modern-day Hitlers annihilate
the civilian population in Syria.
I commend Senate Majority Leader
MITCH MCCONNELL for passing S. 1, the
Strengthening America’s Security in
the Middle East Act.
Last week, many of us, including my-
self, signed the discharge petition for
the companion legislation to S. 1 here
in the House, H.R. 336 sponsored by
MIKE MCCAUL from Texas. This legisla-
tion includes the Caesar Syria Civilian
Protection Act, which has critical pro-
visions to hold Assad accountable for
his atrocities.
As Speaker PELOSI well knows, this
House, under Republican leadership,
has passed the Caesar bill three times
over the last three Congresses, only to
have it bogged down in the Senate.
Now Leader MCCONNELL has acted,
and we, in the House, must now act
with expedition and pass H.R. 336 to
end this step back into darkness, to
stop the torture and the murder of
thousands, and to move to convict
Assad and his henchmen for war
crimes.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

MATERIAL
REVISION TO THE AGGREGATES, ALLOCATIONS,

This adjustment responds to House consid-
eration of H.R. 1500, as amended, the Con-
sumers First Act. This adjustment is allow-
able under section l(d)(2) of H. Res. 293, as
H.R. 1500, as amended, would not increase
the deficit for either of the following time

2020–2029. It shall apply while that legisla-
tion is under consideration and take effect

Accordingly, I am revising the aggregate
spending level for fiscal year 2020 and the ag-
gregate revenue level for 2020 and 2020–2029
and the allocation for the House Committee
on Financial Services for fiscal year 2020.
For purposes of enforcing titles III and IV of
the CBA and other budgetary enforcement
provisions, the revised aggregates and allo-
cation are to be considered as aggregates and
allocations included in the budget resolu-
tion, pursuant to the Statement published in
the Congressional Record on May 3, 2019, as

The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Almighty God, we are grateful for
life and all of its gifts. Thank You for
the beauty of the Earth, for the maj-
esty of the skies, and for the wonder of
Your love and grace.
Draw near to our lawmakers as they
seek to see You more clearly, love You
more dearly, and follow You more
nearly each day. Lord, let the light of
Your understanding illuminate the
path they travel. Teach them to trust
Your precepts and to obey Your com-
mands, permitting You to guide them
with Your wisdom and might. When
this day is done, may they look back
with the realization that they have
been loving and kind, generous and
faithful, joyful and good.
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.

NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
this week presents us with more oppor-
tunities to make progress on the back-
log of qualified nominees who are still
awaiting Senate confirmation.
We began yesterday by voting to ad-
vance an exceptionally well-qualified
nominee to the Federal judiciary. Dan-
iel P. Collins of California was chosen
by President Trump to be U.S. circuit
court judge for the Ninth Circuit, and
the reasons why are abundantly clear.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2986 May 21, 2019
Mr. Collins is a graduate of Harvard
and of Stanford Law School. He has
held clerkships on both the Ninth Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Su-
preme Court for Justice Scalia. He
served at the Department of Justice as
Associate Deputy Attorney General
and as Attorney-Advisor in the Office
of Legal Counsel. He spent 4 years as
an assistant U.S. attorney. He has com-
plemented that experience with more
than 20 years of well-regarded work in
private practice.
Mr. Collins has developed a reputa-
tion for legal excellence. The American
Bar Association rates him well quali-
fied for this new post. Our colleagues
on the Judiciary Committee reported
him favorably here to the floor.
I hope my colleagues will join me as
we vote later today to confirm this fine
nominee.
Following the Collins nomination, we
will consider four more nominations to
district courts around our Nation:
Howard Nielson of Utah, Stephen Clark
of Missouri, Carl Nichols of the Dis-
trict of Columbia, and Kenneth Bell of
North Carolina. Each has been tapped
by the President to fill important va-
cancies. Collectively, they represent
decades of experience in private prac-
tice and decades more in public service,
and they come before us with the high
esteem of their legal peers.
Take the case of Mr. Nielson, whose
nomination we will consider first.
Former circuit judge Mike Luttig, for
whom he served as law clerk, said:
‘‘Howard Nielson may well be the sin-
gle most qualified person to serve on
the federal bench that I have ever had
the privilege to know.’’
It would be hard to come up with a
more unequivocal endorsement, so I
hope each of my colleagues will join
me in support of Mr. Nielson, along
with each of the nominees who will fol-
low him this week.
I have noticed that a few of my col-
leagues across the aisle have expressed
some displeasure that the Senate has
recently been spending some time on
nominations. I would remind our
friends on the other side that not so
long ago, thoroughly qualified district
judge nominees were the kinds of nomi-
nations that would sail through the
Senate floor by voice vote and in big
groups.
Since this particular President was
inaugurated in 2017, this Democratic
minority has largely taken a different
view. They have chosen to deploy an
unprecedented level of systematic,
across-the-board delaying tactics. The
effect has been the need for cloture
votes and individual consideration for
all kinds of uncontroversial nomina-
tions, where it hadn’t been a tradition
in the Senate in the past. So more than
2 years into this consideration, we are
left with too many vacancies still
unfulfilled and a backlog of qualified
nominees who need considering.
Confirming unobjectionable individ-
uals continues to take more of the Sen-
ate’s time than it should, but this ob-
struction is not going to deter us. We
will be here as long as it takes. We will
keep confirming highly qualified nomi-
nees to the Federal bench. We will keep
putting the President’s team in place
and giving Americans the government
they actually voted for.
f
DISASTER RELIEF
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on another matter, as I have discussed
many times on the floor, powerful nat-
ural disasters have devastated commu-
nities across America. Many are still in
need of aid as they struggle to rebuild.
My colleagues know all too well the
destruction that was brought to States
across the Southeast, the gulf coast,
and Puerto Rico by a bad hurricane
season: tens of billions of dollars in
damage to buildings and infrastructure
and thousands of people left without
shelter or access to clean water and
electricity.
We remember the record wildfires
that swept across our western regions,
the tornadoes that tore through the
Deep South, and the rampant flooding
that sunk entire communities across
the Midwest and affected many of my
fellow Kentuckians as well.
We have seen the pain caused by na-
ture’s worst. Now it is time for Con-
gress to finally—finally—demonstrate
our commitment to America’s best. It
is time to deliver supplemental re-
sources for the rebuilding efforts that,
in many cases, have been inching—just
inching—along for months. It is well
past time to show the relief workers,
the volunteers, and the families still
picking up the pieces that we have
their backs.
In recent days, important progress
has been made to deliver on this over-
due commitment. Chairman SHELBY,
Ranking Member LEAHY, our col-
leagues on the Appropriations Com-
mittee, and their counterparts over in
the House are continuing their hard
work to reach a bipartisan solution
that meets the most pressing needs of
all of these affected communities. That
includes promising steps toward bipar-
tisan agreement to deliver critical re-
sources to address the ongoing humani-
tarian crisis at our southern border.
The status quo is completely—com-
pletely—dysfunctional, so I am glad
the agreement seems to be converging
on more resources.
I expect to discuss our progress in
greater detail as the week unfolds, but
it is my sincere hope that in both par-
ties and in both Chambers we will fi-
nally—finally—be able to reach a
meaningful consensus that can become
law and deliver on the priorities of
communities that are in need all across
our country.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.

ABORTION
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
over the last year, women’s reproduc-
tive rights have come under a new level
of assault. From Alabama to Missouri,
to Texas, to Georgia, and beyond, over
300 new restrictions have been proposed
in 39 States—bans on abortion as early
as 6 weeks, so-called heartbeat bills,
arbitrary waiting periods, and restric-
tions on clinics so severe that they
force any center that performs an abor-
tion to close down, leaving a few of our
States with no more than a single clin-
ic.
Ten such bills have now passed into
law. These restrictions fly in the face
of public opinion. The vast majority of
the American public don’t want to see
Roe overturned or a woman’s right to
choose curtailed so severely as to
render it meaningless.
I understand why many of my col-
leagues here in the Senate don’t want
to associate themselves with these ex-
treme anti-abortion laws. Some of
them have even publicly opposed the
law passed by Alabama’s Republicans,
including the House Republican leader
and the President. But let’s face it.
There is a sleight of hand going on
here, because while many of my col-
leagues don’t support these policies out
loud, they are, at the same time, con-
firming judges to the Federal bench
with horrendous records on women’s
rights, many of whom hold extreme
views on Roe. These judges, in many
ways, have just as much power as State
legislatures to restrict a woman’s right
to choose and limit access to contra-
ceptives through the courts.
Just look at some of the judges the
Republican Senate has approved in the
past 2 years with almost unanimous
support on the Republican side. Look
at Leonard Steven Grasz, who wrote
about the ‘‘moral bankruptcy that’s
the legacy of Roe v. Wade.’’
What about Amy Coney Barrett? She
said Roe v. Wade had been ‘‘erro-
neously decided’’ and called the ACA’s
birth control provisions ‘‘an assault on
religious liberty.’’ A lot of these judges
are not just against abortion. They are
against contraception. She is on the
bench for life. Amy Coney Barrett, who
said that, is on the bench for life and
on President Trump’s short list for the
Supreme Court.
Let’s not forget Justice Kavanaugh,
who refused to affirm that Roe was set-
tled law and now sits on the one body
with the power to overturn it.
Just last week, Republicans con-
firmed Wendy Vitter, who said Planned

Parenthood kills 150,000 a year and
once pushed the idea that contracep-
tives cause cancer.
We have more coming down the pipe-
line. Soon the Senate may consider the
nomination of Stephen Clark, who be-
longed to an organization called Law-
yers for Life. He once compared Roe v.
Wade to the Dred Scott case.
So Republicans are playing a cynical
long game here. They refuse to com-
ment on the anti-abortion bills but are
content to install anti-choice judges
across the Federal bench who will up-
hold many of these very same laws. It
is hypocritical. It is sort of like that
old routine. They are saying: No, no,
no, I am not for these laws. Judges, ap-
prove them. I am supporting judges
who approve them.
It is not fair, it is not right, it is cyn-
ical, and the American people are
going to get wise to it. We are watch-
ing the endgame of a long and con-
certed campaign by the far right to
erode a woman’s right to choose
through the courts. From the moment
that Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973,
the most extreme elements of the Re-
publican Party have plotted its demise.
The Federalist Society was founded
with the intent of cultivating a genera-
tion of judges loyal to conservative
causes. Its founder, Leonard Leo, was,
above all, an anti-choice advocate—
some would say, even further, a fa-
natic. Now that they have a Repub-
lican President and a Republican Sen-
ate, the Federalist Society can push
judge after judge after judge onto the
bench with barely a delay and with
barely a discussion, where they will
have the power to severely curtail a
woman’s right to choose.
My Republican friends who profess
opposition or indifference to these ex-
treme anti-abortion bills while voting
for hard-right, anti-Roe judges are en-
gaging in subterfuge, if not hypocrisy.
f
CHINA
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, fi-
nally, there is a topic I have discussed
before—the administration’s moves to
block access to telecommunications
equipment to China’s state-controlled
and state-backed firms, like Huawei. I
firmly back these measures. Our de-
fense, law enforcement, and intel-
ligence officials have publicly testified
that Huawei and other Chinese telecom
companies pose a national threat to
the security of the United States.
Their technology could allow China to
spy on Americans, steal their data, and
otherwise conduct espionage.
Also, there is another point. China
has taken advantage of us. There is a
huge consensus now in America that
that has happened. We didn’t have that
consensus even 5 years ago, but wheth-
er it is business or labor, average
American citizens, Democrats, or Re-
publicans, everyone agrees that China
takes advantage, and one of the main
ways they take advantage is they don’t
let our companies that have top-line
products sell them in China, except
under restrictions that make it almost
impossible for them to do it. Our major
tech companies are excluded from
China, but China, at the same time,
can sell anything it wants here.
‘‘Reciprocity’’ should be our watch
word. If Google or Facebook or any of
our other companies can’t sell in
China, their top companies shouldn’t
sell here until they let us in. That is
what has happened with Huawei, in ad-
dition to the national security con-
cerns, and it makes sense.
So I say to the Commerce Depart-
ment: Stay strong.
We are now talking about some 90-
day delay. I hope this is not a prelude
to what we did with ZTE, when we
stood tough at the beginning. It had an
effect, and then we backed off.
President Trump, don’t back off on
Huawei.
Commerce Secretary Ross, don’t
back off on Huawei.
Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin and
Ambassador Lighthizer, stay strong.
This will get the Chinese to play fair;
talking won’t. Tariffs are one tool; this
is another. We need all the tools in our
toolbox to get China to play fair.
I yield the floor.

TARIFFS
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, Fri-
day’s announcement that the adminis-
tration had reached an agreement to
remove steel and aluminum tariffs on
Canada and Mexico was great news for
American consumers, producers, and
workers. Mexican and Canadian retal-
iatory tariffs on U.S. products have al-
ready been lifted. That is a big deal for
American producers, especially for
farmers and ranchers, who were hit the
hardest by Mexico and Canada’s retal-
iatory tariffs.
Friday’s agreement is also important
because it removes a significant road-
block to passage of the U.S.-Mexico-
Canada trade agreement. With the alu-
minum and steel tariff settlement and
labor reforms recently adopted by the
Mexican Government, two major
Democratic objections to passage of
the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement
have been addressed. Now it is time for
the House Democratic leadership to in-
dicate its willingness to take up the
agreement in the near future.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement
would boost almost every sector of the
American economy, from automotive
manufacturing, to digital services, to
dairy farming. It would create 176,000
new jobs and increase wages for work-
ers. It is time to take up this agree-
ment. As I said, the U.S.-Mexico-Can-
ada free-trade agreement would be a
boon for U.S. producers and U.S. work-
ers.
This is the kind of stuff we should be
spending our time on in Washington—
measures that grow our economy, in-
crease opportunity, and improve life
for the American people. That is what
Republicans have been working on. Our
policies have helped produce the lowest
unemployment rate in 50 years and
more jobs and higher wages for work-
ers.
Unfortunately, my colleagues across
the aisle seem more interested in re-
litigating the 2016 election and accel-
erating their party’s rapid move to-
ward the radical fringe left.
While I realize the Democrats are dis-
appointed with the results of the 2016
Presidential election, it is time for
them to accept the fact that they lost.
It has been more than 2 years now, and
Democrats are still more focused on
opposing this President than on get-
ting things done for the American peo-
ple.
When Democrats do get around to
talking about legislation, too often, it
is proposals from the radical fringe
left, which is rapidly swallowing up the
Democratic mainstream. Take the
Green New Deal, the Democrats’ plan
for a government takeover of a large
section of the economy in the name of
clean energy. The estimated price tag
for this government takeover is be-
tween $51 trillion and $93 trillion over
10 years. To put that number in per-
spective, $93 trillion is more money
than the U.S. Government has spent in
its entire history, and $93 trillion is
more money than the 2017 gross domes-
tic product of the entire world.
How do Democrats plan to pay for
this? Well, they don’t actually have a
plan. Their usual ‘‘tax the rich’’ solu-
tion won’t work since taxing every
wealthy American at a 100-percent rate
wouldn’t come anywhere close to pay-
ing for the Green New Deal. Should the
Green New Deal ever come to pass,
working Americans would face massive
tax hikes for the privilege of having
government dictate the design of their
house and the type of their car.
Then, of course, there is the Demo-
crats’ plan for a government takeover
of the Nation’s healthcare. Under so-

called Medicare for All, the govern-
ment would take away Americans’ in-
surance choices and force everyone
into a single one-size-fits-all, govern-
ment-run plan and then tax Americans
to pay for it.
Thanks to policies like tax reform,
American families are doing better
than they have been doing in a long
time. They have been taking home
more money. They have access to bet-
ter jobs and more opportunities, and
they are enjoying better wages and
benefits. To most people, it would seem
logical to continue and build on the
policies that have gotten us here, but
not to Democrats. Democrats want to
overturn the policies that have gotten
us to this point. Instead of tax cuts,
they want tax hikes so they can imple-
ment their socialist fantasies. Instead
of less government interference in
Americans’ lives, they want more.
They think the government should be
directing your healthcare choices, your
housing choices, your energy choices,
and much more. It is unfortunate that
the Democratic Party is being swal-
lowed by its extreme left wing.
Republicans are going to do every-
thing we can to protect Americans
from Democrats’ socialist fantasies and
to continue to expand the choices and
the opportunities available to Amer-
ican families.

DISASTER RELIEF
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, next
Saturday, June 1, marks the official
start of the Atlantic hurricane season.
It is an important reminder for every-
one—from individuals and families to
businesses and local officials—to re-
view preparedness efforts to ensure you
are ready for anything that Mother Na-
ture may throw at you.
There are simple steps, of course,
that everybody can take, like review-
ing evacuation routes, signing up for
emergency alerts, and making a family
communications plan. This is also a
great time to look at your insurance
policies to ensure that you have the
right coverage. This isn’t the most fun
conversation or topic to talk about at
the dinner table, but in the event of a
disaster, these small steps can make a
world of difference.
As we gear up for the 2019 Atlantic
hurricane season, I can’t help but
think back on the devastation my
State saw in 2017 when Hurricane Har-
vey hit. This storm was the largest
rain event in American history, and
some parts of Texas are still in the re-
covery mode. Harvey brought more
than 50 inches of rain to some parts of
Houston.
I am sure that many Americans can
remember the TV footage of the dev-
astating scenes and the heroism of peo-
ple who rose to the challenge and
helped. The roofs of homes were com-
pletely torn off and revealed knee-deep
water and scattered furniture. Streets
looked like rivers that were filled with
small boats that led rescue operations.
Folks linked arms and made human
chains to help save people who were
stranded in their vehicles.
It was the second most expensive
hurricane in history, only behind Hur-
ricane Katrina, with an estimated total
cost of $125 billion. While we can put a
pricetag on the damaged homes, busi-
nesses, and infrastructure, there is no
way we could even begin to quantify
the impact this storm had on lost loved
ones and how much it completely up-
ended so many lives.
With that heartbreak fresh on our
minds, it only underscores the impor-
tance of strengthening our prepared-
ness efforts. Unlike many threats we
face, either from our adversaries on the
ground or in cyberspace, there is noth-
ing we can do to stop Mother Nature in
her tracks. Our only course of action is
to be prepared and to build resilient
communities that can withstand the
impact. We need to continue to do ev-
erything in our power to provide assist-
ance to State and local governments so
they can protect themselves in the
event of severe weather.
One may recall, in the wake of Hurri-
cane Harvey and other natural disas-
ters, that Congress worked hard to pro-
vide disaster relief to Texas and other
States that were adversely affected.
While there is still a lot of work to be
done, these dollars have helped my
State to rebuild and to bring back
some semblance of normalcy. I am
grateful to all of our colleagues here
for working with us, as well as with
Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and
the other places that were hit at about
that same time. I am grateful for the
assistance of a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators and Congressmen and for Presi-
dent Trump who worked together to
provide disaster relief in the wake of
this devastation. Yet here is the rub—
much of the funding that has been ap-
proved for Texas still hasn’t been un-
tangled from the redtape here in Wash-
ington, DC.
In February 2018—15 months ago—
Congress appropriated more than $28
billion in community development
block grants for disaster recovery, with
roughly $12 billion intended specifi-
cally for mitigation purposes. About $4
billion of that was designated for
Texas, and it could still be used to do
things, like to repair wastewater treat-
ment facilities that haven’t been fully
restored, to carry out important eco-
nomic revitalization in decimated
areas, or to relocate or elevate dam-
aged facilities in order to prepare for
the next storm. Yet we have not seen a
cent of that $4 billion because it has
been tied up at the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget.
I have said before and will say it
again: I look at the Constitution. I see
what the President’s authority is. I see
what the House of Representatives’ au-
thority is. I see what the U.S. Senate’s
authority is. My understanding is,
when they all agree on an appropria-
tions bill, that it is the law of the land.
Yet somehow, this Agency—the Office
of Management and Budget—has seen
fit to usurp that authority and to de-
feat the will of Congress when it comes
to getting disaster relief to the in-
tended beneficiaries.
This undue delay, I believe, is unac-
ceptable but is, sadly, not unique to
my State. Other States are facing this
same unnecessary holdup in getting
desperately needed funds. One of those
States is West Virginia, which has been
waiting more than 3 years to receive
funding after the devastating floods of
June 2016.
I and my colleague from West Vir-
ginia, Senator MANCHIN, recently intro-
duced a bill that would require the Of-
fice of Management and Budget to en-
sure that these appropriated funds are
promptly disbursed. The Bipartisan
Disaster Recovery Funding Act would
start a timer—a shock clock, if you
will—on when the OMB must release
the money. It would give it 60 days to
get these dollars untangled from the
redtape and get them to the commu-
nities that desperately need them.
It is important to note that this
change would apply not only to this
particular block of funding but to any
funds appropriated to States that are

As appropriators continue to work on
a disaster supplemental this week, I
hope they will include a provision to
ensure that States like Texas that
have already suffered from a major dis-
aster don’t become victims of govern-
ment bureaucracy.
It has now been 467 days since the
President signed a bill that would have
sent roughly $48 billion to Texas, and it
is tough to imagine what communities
could have accomplished in that time
and how much progress could have
been made if simply Congress’s and the
executive branch’s will had been car-
ried out by the Federal bureaucracy.
With the 2019 hurricane season only a
week and half away, it is critical we
get this money out of Washington and
into the hands of those who need it so
we can begin to work on long-term
projects to protect the Texas coast and
protect against future storms.
Of course Hurricane Harvey was not
the first storm to hit my State, and I
guarantee it will not be the last. Tex-
ans have waited long enough for the
funding that we were promised and
that Congress appropriated over the
signature of the President, and I hope
we can pass something soon to improve
the resilience in these communities
and carry out congressional will.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

ABORTION
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want
to start today by expressing my appre-
ciation to all of my colleagues who will
be out here today speaking out and to
the women and men nationwide who
are doing the same today in their own
communities.
In the last few weeks, we have seen
some of the most blatant and cruel ef-
forts yet to deny women access to a
safe, legal abortion. We have seen leg-
islation so extreme, it would even
block a 12-year-old survivor of rape
from getting an abortion and sentence
healthcare providers to prison for pro-
viding safe, medically sound care to
their patients, which is their responsi-
bility.
The extreme politicians behind these
cruel abortion bans are not stopping in
Alabama or Missouri or anywhere else;
they want to take these bans all the
way to the Supreme Court. They want
to allow Brett Kavanaugh to do what
President Trump and Republicans
chose him to do—roll back the decision
in Roe v. Wade that established a wom-
an’s constitutionally protected right to
make her own decisions about her own
body and her own healthcare.
They are pushing for this even
though they know as well as we do that
without the ability to exercise that
right, women lose their lives; even
though they know just as well as we do
that without this right, doctors will be
blocked from providing medically ap-
propriate care. Let me be frank. Ex-
treme conservatives will push these
abortion bans all the way to the Su-
preme Court even though they know—
or maybe even because they do know—
that in a world where women cannot
control what happens to their own bod-
ies, they are less able to plan their
family and stay financially secure and
independent. That means they are less
free and less equal.
I am not going to stand for that, and
Senate Democrats are not going to
stand for that either. I am proud to be
on the floor today with a number of my
colleagues who will be here standing
for what our Constitution confirms is
true: Women have the right to access
safe, legal abortion, and this makes our
country stronger because women are
absolutely critical to our country’s
strength. I am proud to be making
clear that even in the face of relentless
attacks on women’s health and rights,
we are not going to back down one bit.
The truth is, there are certain ex-
treme politicians around the country
who want to take us backward to the
‘‘Mad Men’’ era or, honestly, quite a
bit before that. But they aren’t speak-
ing for our country—quite the oppo-
site. In fact, the vast majority of
women and men nationwide, including
those from all different backgrounds,
agree that abortion should be safe and
it should be legal, just as our Constitu-
tion says. Those people are watching
now. They are speaking up, and they
are absolutely going to remember who
stood up to protect women’s health and
rights and who pushed to take those
rights away.
We have a number of Senators who
will be speaking about this today, and
I want to thank them for being here
today.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, while she
is on the floor, I want to commend my
northwest colleague and friend, Sen-
ator MURRAY, for all of her leadership,
constantly coming to the floor and
leading us on this enormous health
challenge—a challenge that is really
existential for so many women across
the country.
Right now in State capitals across
the land, Republican lawmakers are
passing extreme bills that throw in the
trash can 45 years of settled law on re-
productive health. This is an open, co-
ordinated attack on Roe v. Wade and a
woman’s right to choose the healthcare
she needs. These Republican law-
makers are passing bills that are not
only harmful, but they are overwhelm-
ingly opposed by the public—bills with
harsh criminal penalties for women
and doctors, bills with no exceptions
for cases of rape or incest, bills that ex-
plicitly compare women getting med-
ical care to the Holocaust. Let me re-
peat that—bills that explicitly com-
pare women getting medical care to
the Holocaust.
I want to be clear on what this is all
about. The party of Donald Trump is
insisting on government control of
women’s bodies. That is what is on the
table in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri,
and elsewhere—government control of
women’s bodies.
Millions of women across the land
are watching in anger and in fear as all
of this is playing out. I have heard
from many of them back home in Or-
egon. I heard it last weekend. I have
four town meetings in the rural part of
Oregon coming up; I am going to hear
it again. Women are afraid for the fu-
ture—their future and their family’s
future—because they know what is at
stake with this coordinated attack on
their rights.
First, it puts women’s lives in dan-
ger.
The reality is, abortions will still
happen in States that pass these laws,
but those abortions will happen later,
and they will be unsafe. Women are
going to die. That is a fact. Women are
going to die because of these restric-
tions. If you need proof, just look at
the figures before and after the Roe
case. In the decades before Roe, thou-
sands of women died due to unsafe
abortions. And those are only the ones
people know about. That doesn’t even
take into consideration the unnamed,
the unknown victims of those mis-
guided policies. After Roe was decided
in 1973, women’s healthcare got safer.
Now, once again, there is an effort to
undermine that safety of women.
Second, in key ways, the future these
restrictive laws are creating is worse
for women and healthcare professionals
than before Roe.
What we are talking about now is
jailing doctors for life. We are talking
about treating women like hardened
criminals after they get a medical pro-
cedure. Women in some places are fac-
ing the prospect that they may need to
report miscarriages to the government
or they could wind up in prison.
The other side in this debate paints a
picture of women exercising their right
to choose that is unfair and unreal-
istic. These are incredibly difficult
choices. Many women exercising the
right to choose have just been hit with
the most devastating medical news
that prospective parents can face. It is
not up to State lawmakers and govern-
ment bureaucrats to step in and inter-
fere with this intensely private and
personal choice, but that is exactly
what is on offer with the laws being
passed in statehouses across the land.
These laws bind and punish women
with a level of government control that
did not exist before Roe. This is right
out of nightmarish fiction. It is a co-
ordinated attack on women’s rights
that is cruel and dangerous.
Abortion and other reproductive de-
cisions are healthcare, and healthcare
choices ought to be made by women
with the help of doctors they trust, not
by the Federal Government and not by
State lawmakers—women and doctors.
That is it. Full stop.
My Democratic colleagues and I want
to thank Senator MURRAY and Senator
SHAHEEN, who have been such advo-
cates for women’s healthcare for many
years in public service. They are here.
We are all going to be part of this ef-
fort that I am proud to join in to fight
at the Federal level with everything we
have to stand up for women’s right to
make intensely personal choices, and
we are going to be joining those women
across the land who are standing up
and fighting with everything they
have.
The government should not have con-
trol of women’s bodies—end of story.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire.
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am
here to join my colleagues. I was going
to say I am pleased, but I am not
pleased. I am disappointed that we are
here on the floor today talking about
something that should be an issue that
is decided by women with their fami-
lies and their physicians. Yet we are
here to sound the alarm about the re-
lentless assault State legislatures and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2990 May 21, 2019
this administration have leveled
against constitutionally protected re-
productive rights and a woman’s right
to choose the healthcare she needs.
I certainly applaud Senator MURRAY,
who has done such a great job of lead-
ing the response to this assault, and
my colleague from Oregon, Senator
WYDEN, for his efforts.
This radical effort to limit women’s
freedom to a full range of reproductive
care is part of a broader strategy by
some in this country to take
healthcare away from people who need
it. Americans across the country, both
women and men, are calling out these
threats and fighting them head-on.
Today, in hundreds of capitals across
this country, in courthouses, at hun-
dreds of rallies, a powerful message is
being sent that we are not going back.
As Members of Congress here in Wash-
ington, we need to join them and de-
fend women’s reproductive rights.
In just the past 2 weeks, Governors in
Alabama and Georgia signed extreme
and dangerous abortion restrictions
into law. Yesterday, the Missouri Leg-
islature passed another bill to place
draconian restrictions on a woman’s
access to abortion. These actions are
part of a concerted effort around the
country to overturn Roe v. Wade and to
deny women access to reproductive
care.
What is so ironic about this is that
this is coming at a time when last year
this country saw fewer unintended
pregnancies than at any time in our
history because giving women access to
family planning, to the range of repro-
ductive healthcare that women need,
means that there are fewer unintended
pregnancies. What laws like this will
mean is that there will be more abor-
tions, more unintended pregnancies,
more maternal health deaths. That is
not the direction in which we should be
going.
All of these State actions are con-
cerning, especially the new Alabama
law, which would outlaw abortion in
virtually all instances with no excep-
tion for cases of rape or incest. The
Alabama law also establishes prison
sentences for providers who perform
abortions in violation of the abortion
ban. So think about that for a second.
If a doctor performs an abortion for a
rape victim, the Alabama law could put
that doctor in prison for as long as or
even longer than the rapist. That
makes no sense. The Alabama abortion
ban, and so many other State laws like
it, will not only impede on a woman’s
freedom to make her own reproductive
choices, but it will also push women
into the shadows and increase the like-
lihood of unsafe abortions. We know
that. We have data that shows that—
not just in the United States but
around the world.
Today, one in three women live in
States where abortion would be out-
lawed if Roe v. Wade is overturned.
The Alabama law and other State
abortion bans are designed as a direct
challenge to the protections provided
by Roe in the hopes of forcing action
from the Supreme Court and sowing
chaos in those States where abortion
would be outlawed. So rather than
thinking about women and how they
will be affected by this law, it is strict-
ly designed to try to challenge the cur-
rent Roe v. Wade law.
Unfortunately, even in the light of
the extreme nature of these recent
abortion bans, we have an administra-
tion that is compounding the issue
through its own actions to interfere
with access to reproductive health
services. Now, whether it is creating
new administrative obstacles to insur-
ance coverage of abortion, preventing
title X family planning clinics from in-
forming their patients about reproduc-
tive care choices, or any of the many
other recent Federal actions, the
Trump administration’s clear goal is to
chip away at access to abortion.
Now, these recent actions by States
and the administration pose grave
threats to the freedoms and reproduc-
tive health protections that are relied
on by women all across this country.
At this critical time, we need to say
loud and clear that we are ready to
fight these extreme actions with every-
thing we have.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The Senator from Washington.
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I
come to the floor to join my colleagues
who have been speaking this morning
about the access to healthcare for
women in America. Today, as women
take action across the Nation to bring
focus to this issue, I would like to join
my colleagues, particularly the senior
Senator from Washington, and I thank
her for her leadership on this impor-
tant issue. She knows better than most
how many times the Senate and the
Congress in the last decade have fought
over access to healthcare for women. It
seems like every budget debate, every
fiscal cliff, every budget negotiation,
and every issue had to have a debate
about whether we were going to defund
Planned Parenthood. So it is not a sur-
prise that we are out here today as
States across the Nation try to roll
back access to healthcare. I guarantee
you, I believe and my State believes
that access to healthcare should be and
is protected under the Constitution as
a right to privacy. We believe that and
codified Roe v. Wade into statute by a
vote of the people in the 1990s. So any
time anybody is going to take on ac-
cess to healthcare for women and erode
what is a basic right in our State and,
I believe, a basic right protected in our
Constitution, we are going to raise our
voices. You are going to hear from us.
So it is amazing to me that every budg-
et battle and every debate here in the
Senate comes down to rolling back ac-
cess to women’s healthcare.
Now we see Supreme Court Justices
who may or may not uphold those
basic rights as were established in Con-
necticut v. Griswold, as did a Supreme
Court Justice, who just happened to
hail from the State of Washington, who
understood that the privacy rights pro-
tected in the Constitution are in the
penumbra of rights. So, yes, I believe
that our Supreme Court Justices
should also continue that well-estab-
lished practice of observing those pri-
vacy rights. So it is hard to say what
all of these State actions will lead to,
whether they will make it to the Su-
preme Court and what this Supreme
Court will have to say about it. But I
can tell you that we here in the Sen-
ate—women who understand the access
to healthcare—are so emphatic that we
not erode these rights.
I had the very unfortunate situation
of having to speak at a funeral this
weekend for a 28-year-old former staff
member who died of cancer. I know
how much fight she had in her, but it
was afterward where one of her rel-
atives said to me: Senator, you cannot
leave this unaddressed.
Young women at college campuses
are not getting the breast exams to do
early detection that they should. They
should be out there. We should do more
to evangelize that young women need
to pay attention to their healthcare.
Yet we are here across the Nation hav-
ing this debate, and I guarantee you
that the access to healthcare to do
those early detections in a lot of com-
munities comes with the access that
organizations like Planned Parenthood
and others deliver. So while they are
not what is immediately under attack
by these States, I guarantee you that it
is all a part of a larger debate that
needs to stop.
Healthcare should be the right of
women to be discussed with their doc-
tors and continue to be protected under
our Constitution.
I thank the President.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota.
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I
thank my colleague from Washington
for that personal story, and I am sorry
for her loss of a former staff member. I
think that story is a good place to
start because this isn’t just about an
isolated bill passing in one State. This
is actually part of a greater effort.
As you look at what this administra-
tion has been trying to do since day
one, defunding Planned Parenthood—
OK, well, that is where one out of five
women in their lifetime will go to seek
healthcare for things like cancer
screenings and for things like contra-
ception. You look at the fact that over
the span of the last administration, we
actually reduced abortions to the low-
est level in recorded history. That is a

good thing. People who are personally
opposed to abortion or people who are
pro-choice can agree that that is a
good thing. Why did that happen? Be-
cause contraception was available.
Why did that happen? Because
healthcare was available that allowed,
with more ease, women to access con-
traception. So now what do we have?
We have three things going on. These
restrictive laws that literally put doc-
tors in prison for 99 years is what I will
talk about today. We have an effort to
defund Planned Parenthood and to re-
duce access to contraception as a re-
sult. Then we have an effort—a major
effort—to repeal the entire Affordable
Care Act, which would allow women to
be kicked off of their healthcare insur-
ance if they have a preexisting condi-
tion. Before that act came into law, in
eight States, being a victim of domes-
tic abuse was considered a preexisting
condition. So do not see these laws
that were just passed in these States
and are being considered in these
States as isolated. Look at it as a com-
plete package, and it is not a package
that the women of this country want to
get in the mail.
I have always believed that a wom-
an’s most personal and difficult med-
ical decisions should be made with her
doctor and her family and that those
decisions should not be undermined or
politicized by Government officials.
But that is exactly what we are seeing
today. In the last few months, an
alarming number of States have passed
laws to limit a woman’s ability to seek
reproductive healthcare services. Ken-
tucky, Ohio, Mississippi, and Georgia
have all recently passed measures that
basically amount to a ban on abortion.
Just last week, Alabama passed a bill
that effectively and in writing banned
abortion completely. The bill which
passed the Alabama State Senate—by
the way, without a vote of a single
woman senator—would allow a doctor
who performed an abortion to be sent
to jail for 99 years. The Alabama law’s
only exception is if a woman’s life is at
risk. It does not even include an excep-
tion for incidents of rape or incest. So
what does this mean? Well, if your kid
is in college and gets brutally raped, it
means that she would not have a
choice about whether or not she would
carry a baby. That is what that law
says in Alabama. And if a doctor inter-
vened, if a doctor wanted to help in
that State, he would be sent to prison
for 99 years—or up to 99 years. This is
not something I am making up or exag-
gerating; this is what this bill that
passed one of the States and is similar
to bills in other States actually says.
What we are seeing, of course, is
wrong and unconstitutional. These
bills directly infringe on a woman’s
right to make her own medical deci-
sions and the precedent that the Su-
preme Court set in Roe v. Wade, which
has been affirmed many times over the
last 46 years.
You wonder where the public is on
this? Seventy-three percent of Ameri-
cans do not believe that Roe v. Wade
should be reversed. In my State, I have
people who are pro-choice, and I have
people who are pro-life. I have people
who personally believe they do not
want to have an abortion; however,
they don’t think that their views
should dictate what happens to their
neighbors. That is the problem. That is
the nub of the problem with what is
going on in these States.
The precedent in Roe is clear, but
these lawmakers have decided that
they want to take away a woman’s
basic right to make a personal
healthcare decision. In fact, they are
passing these bills with the hope that
it goes to the Supreme Court where
this administration has placed judges
on that Court where there is a lot of
hope, with the people who are passing
these restrictive laws, that they are
going to overturn Roe v. Wade.
After signing the new abortion ban
into law, the Governor of Alabama re-
leased a statement in which he said the
sponsors of this bill believe it is time,
once again, for the U.S. Supreme Court
to revisit this important matter, and
they believe this act may bring about
‘‘the best opportunity for this to
occur.’’
So don’t tell me this is just one legis-
lature deciding they are going to do
something other people in this Cham-
ber on the other side of the aisle don’t
agree with. No. No. No. This has been
an effort that has been going on for
years. This is an effort that is going on
during an administration with a Presi-
dent that, in a townhall meeting in
March of 2016, said that he thought
women should be punished for making
that decision. A few hours later, his
campaign tries to dial it back with the
statement: No, he meant that doctors
should be punished.
This is not just an isolated incident,
which is why so many of my colleagues
have taken to the floor today. We can
have individual disagreements, and we
can have our own personal beliefs, but
as elected officials, we must follow the
Constitution of the United States.
Overturning Roe isn’t just unconstitu-
tional. As I said, it is against the wish-
es of the vast majority of the people in
this country.
In the last few years, as I have noted,
we have seen an assault on women’s ac-
cess to care. We have seen it with the
attempt to defund Planned Parent-
hood, even though, during the Obama
administration, we saw a historic de-
crease in abortions. According to a
CDC study conducted between 2006 and
2015, abortion rates fell to historic lows
near the end of the Obama administra-
tion.
What should we be doing? Well, we
should be providing more access to
healthcare services, comprehensive
health education, and contraception,
not less. We should ensure that women
are equipped with the knowledge and
resources they need to make informed
healthcare decisions.
In the Senate, I have fought back
against efforts to undermine the abil-
ity of a woman to make choices about
her own health. I have cosponsored the
Women’s Health Protection Act, im-
portant legislation led by Senator
BLUMENTHAL, to prohibit laws intended
to restrict women’s access to reproduc-
tive health services, and I look forward
to cosponsoring this bill again when it
is reintroduced.
I thank Senator MURRAY for her lead-
ership over her many, many years in
this area. It is our responsibility to
treat women in every State in this
Union with respect and dignity, instead
of using them as political pawns.
I join my colleagues in condemning
these recent efforts to restrict women’s
access to healthcare services, and I will
continue working to protect the health
and lives of women across the country.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

IMMIGRATION
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is dif-
ficult to believe that it is happening,
but I have seen it. It was about 5 weeks
ago that I was in El Paso, TX. I went
down to see what has happening on the
border. You can’t escape all the stories
that have been written about the num-
ber of people who are coming to our
border and what is happening to them,
so I wanted to see it for myself.
I saw what was a detention facility
for people who had been stopped at the
border. There was a cell with a plate
glass window, so that you could see ev-
erything inside. Above the door of the
cell, it said, ‘‘capacity 35.’’ I looked in-
side and counted—took the time to
slowly count—and I counted 150 men in
that cell, standing shoulder to shoul-
der. Few of them could sit on the
benches on the side of the walls—150.
There was one toilet in that cell.
They were fed their meals to eat stand-
ing up. They slept taking turns lying
down on the floor. Some of them would
be there for 3 days and some as long as
6 weeks.
Next to that cell was another one
with a plate glass window; you could
see inside. Above the door, it read, ‘‘ca-
pacity 16.’’ This was a cell for women.
I counted 75 women in that cell—‘‘ca-
pacity 16.’’ There were four or five of
them with nursing babies.
I have since learned, in the few weeks
since I saw this and witnessed it first-
hand, things have gotten dramatically
worse. The cell with 150 now has al-
most 200 men jammed into it. The cell
with the women is even worse than
what I saw when I visited.
If I described these conditions in a
prison in some foreign country, you
would say: For goodness’ sakes, the
United States of America should speak
up for human rights. We cannot allow
human beings to be treated that way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2992 May 21, 2019
This detention facility for these im-
migrants is in the United States of
America. It has to come to an end, and
it has to start with a commitment by
the people of this country through
their elected representatives in Con-
gress and this President to stop this in-
humane treatment of these individuals.
Today, I am sending a letter that I
never thought I would send. I am join-
ing other Senators in a letter to the
International Red Cross. You see, we
call on the International Red Cross to
go to developing countries and look at
their prison situations and decide
whether they are humane.
I cannot believe that I am asking
them to do this in the United States of
America. Because I have seen it with
my own eyes and I have been told that
it is getting worse, I feel I have no
choice.
I am also asking for the inspector
general of the Department of Homeland
Security to immediately, on an emer-
gency basis, review the detention fa-
cilities for adults and children. Why do
I raise that point? We know what this
administration did last year in a
project called zero tolerance.
Zero tolerance, announced by the At-
torney General of the United States
Jeff Sessions, said we will treat every-
one who comes to our border as a
criminal. Understand that people can
come to our border and present them-
selves, as many of these people do, and
ask for asylum. They have turned
themselves in. They are not sneaking
in.
They have turned themselves in for
adjudication as to whether they are eli-
gible to be in this country. Attorney
General Sessions said last year that we
will treat them as criminals, and there-
fore, because they are suspected crimi-
nals, we will remove their children
from them.
How many kids under zero tolerance
were taken by the Trump administra-
tion away from their parents? More
than two thousand eight hundred—I
know that number because a Federal
judge in southern California took this
administration to court and said: I
want an accounting for every one of
those children.
I saw those children—at least some of
them—in Chicago. They go through a
bureaucratic process and end up at
agencies—at Health and Human Serv-
ices agencies to try to place them in
foster care or connect them up with a
member of their family.
I remember, in a room, they brought
in some of the children who had been
taken away from their parents. There
were two little 4-year-old girls who I
thought were sisters, and then as I
looked more closely, I realized they
weren’t. They just seemed like sisters,
and they had become friends at that fa-
cility. They were 4 years old, holding
hands. We gave them crayons and
coloring books, what you would give to
little kids.
Then I went to an immigration court
proceeding in downtown Chicago in an
office building. You would never know
it from the street, but on the fourth
floor of this high-rise, we have a U.S.
immigration court. A very caring judge
was there, and she was trying to get
through a docket that was very heavy.
She invited me to stay for the first
case of the day that involved two cli-
ents. It was tough to get this pro-
ceeding underway because zero toler-
ance had resulted in more children
coming into these immigration courts.
The difficulty in getting this hearing
underway was that she said: Before we
start, I want everyone to take their
seats.
It was hard to get Marta to take her
seat. Marta was 2 years old. She had to
be lifted into the chair and handed a
stuffed animal for her hearing. Luckily
for the other client, Hamilton, he spot-
ted one of those Matchbox cars on top
of the table, and 4-year-old Hamilton
scrambled up into the chair.
In the United States of America at
an immigration hearing, the clients
were 2 years old and 4 years old be-
cause of the conscious policy of this ad-
ministration to separate children from
their parents. So we have this setting
with detention cells jammed with peo-
ple in inhumane circumstances and the
separation of children from their par-
ents.
I sent a letter to the inspector gen-
eral of the Department of Health and
Human Services asking about these
children who had been separated. They
came back to me a few months ago and
said: We have discovered there were
more.
Before they announced it, this ad-
ministration had been separating in-
fants, toddlers, and children from their
parents as they presented themselves
at the border. The judge who was in-
volved in the case in southern Cali-
fornia stepped in and asked: Well, how
many?
It is now reported at least 1,712 more
kids may have been separated. That
means we have over 4,500 babies, tod-
dlers, infants, and children separated
from their parents by this administra-
tion. Sadly, some of these children will
not be reunited. Their parents were
sent back, usually to the Central
American countries they came from,
and now the kids are in the system and
way too young to even remember who
Mom or Dad was.
This circumstance has reached the
point of a humanitarian crisis on our
border. How can this President, who
was elected promising that he would do
something about immigration, have
brought us to this terrible moment
where we have more people presenting
themselves at the border than we have
had in recent history—certainly those
with children? We have never had fami-
lies in these numbers showing up. The
tougher this President’s rhetoric is and
the meaner his tweets are, the more
people come to our borders. It is ex-
actly the opposite of what he promised
us.
This circumstance here is absolutely
intolerable, unacceptable, and embar-
rassing to our country. That we would
have to call on an international organi-
zation to look at the way we are treat-
ing people in the United States—I am
sorry it has come to this. But in good
conscience, I can’t ignore it.
The most recent news report said
that another child died at the border. I
think that brings the total to five in
the last few months. Is that what
America has come to?
We need to have an immigration pol-
icy that makes sense. Absolutely, we
must have border security. In an age of
terrorism and drug epidemics, I want
to know what is coming into this coun-
try, and I want to know what they are
bringing with them.
Second, the United States certainly
cannot accept everyone in the world
who wants to come here. It is under-
standable they want to live in this
great country. That is what brought
my grandmother and more to these
shores as immigrants to this country.
But we cannot accept everyone in the
world.
Third, we don’t want anyone dan-
gerous coming into this country, pe-
riod. No exceptions. If you are dan-
gerous and not legal in this country,
you should be gone.
Having said that, now it is our bur-
den to come up with a comprehensive
immigration bill that makes sense for
this Nation of immigrants in the 21st
century.
Unfortunately, the U.S. Senate and
this empty Chamber tell you how much
work we do on legislation. We give
speeches—we ran for the Senate to give
speeches—and occasionally we vote on
another nominee every few hours. That
is it. You will not see a comprehensive
immigration bill come to the floor of
the Senate. It hasn’t—not this year and
not for the previous 6 years. But the
last time it did, I was part of a bipar-
tisan effort that wrote one that passed
the Senate with I believe 68 votes—an
overwhelming rollcall, bipartisan, in
favor of immigration reform. That died
in the Republican-controlled House,
and there has never been another try
since. Why were we elected to come
here if we can’t face this problem
squarely, dealing with what is going on
at our border and making sense of our
immigration system?
There is a humanitarian nightmare
on our border, but I will tell you about
another one. This President decided to
end the DACA Program. I know a little
bit about that—maybe more than some
of my colleagues—because it was 19
years ago that I introduced a bill. We
do a lot of that. This bill was called the
DREAM Act—19 years ago. It said: If
you were brought to this country as a
child, you lived here, went to school,
and didn’t get in trouble with the law,
you ought to have a chance to become
legal in America. That was it. For 19
years, we have been trying to make it
the law of the land and have been un-
able to get 60 votes in the Senate. We
always got a majority but never the 60
votes we needed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2993
May 21, 2019
I appealed to my former Senate col-
league and friend, President Obama,
and said: Can you do something to help
these young people who have never
known another country and want to be
part of the United States and its fu-
ture? Many of the schoolchildren who
visit us here get up in their classrooms
every day, and I am proud to say they
put their hands over their hearts and
pledge allegiance to that flag. These
kids do exactly the same thing. It is
the only flag and the only country they
have ever known.
So President Obama created what
was called DACA, and more than 800,000
of these young people stepped up, paid
a filing fee of almost $500, went
through a criminal background check,
and were given a chance to stay legally
in the United States for 2 years at a
time, not to be deported but be able to
work and go to school—more than
800,000 of them.
I really believe in them. And you
know human nature—out of 800,000,
there have to be some of them in there
who are going to disappoint you. But I
stand here today in the Senate and tell
you that in all of these years since
President Obama did that, I have never
heard any of those stories. These are
extraordinary young men and women. I
have told their stories on the floor of
the Senate—over 120 of them—of how
these DACA-protected young people
want to become part of America’s fu-
ture.
Let me tell you about a group of
them in Chicago. Loyola University in
Chicago is a great school, and they
have a great school of medicine. When
they heard about the DACA Program,
they said: We are going to open up
competition to these DACA-protected
young people to compete to go to med-
ical school. And the news flashed
across the country because many of
these young people who dreamed of
being doctors had no chance because
they were undocumented. Because of
DACA, they were given temporary
legal status, and because of Loyola
University, they were able to apply.
Over 30 of them were accepted to the
medical school—some of the brightest
kids living in our country who wanted
to become doctors.
There was a catch: If you went to
Loyola and you needed to borrow
money—and most of them did—you had
to promise to give a year of service
back to the State of Illinois, which
loaned you the money to go to school,
for each year they loaned the money.
They signed up for it. They were ready
to go to neighborhoods where we need-
ed doctors and to small towns in rural
America where we desperately need
doctors. These young people are some
of the best and brightest I have ever
met, every one of them an inspiration.
When President Trump eliminated
the DACA Program, he eliminated
their opportunity to continue their
medical education. You see, after 4
years of medical school, you go into a
residency. A residency is a job, employ-
ment, and it is a lot more than 40 hours
a week, I might add. But since Presi-
dent Trump eliminated DACA, they
cannot legally take a job.
This case is going through the courts
now as to whether the President had
the right to eliminate DACA. He
didn’t. Last Friday, a second court said
that he was wrong, that he had no rea-
son, no basis to eliminate this pro-
gram.
When you hear these stories about
what is happening at the border and at
these detention cells; when you hear
about the conscious decision of this ad-
ministration to separate infants and
toddlers from their parents—4,500 of
them having been separated; when you
hear about this administration coming
forward to eliminate the DACA Pro-
gram and to stop these medical stu-
dents from becoming doctors and serv-
ing in my State, where they are des-
perately needed, you have to ask: Mr.
President, what is your immigration
policy? Why have you made such a
mess of this situation that wasn’t very
good to start with?
And what are we going to do about
it? Anything? Not in this empty Cham-
ber. Not today. We are just going to
pick up the papers every morning and
say: Isn’t it a shame? Well, it is more
than a shame; it is an embarrassment
to this country that this Nation of im-
migrants has reached this moment.
Mr. President, I continue to appeal to
my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle: Please, come forward, and let’s
solve these problems together.
I have been part of bipartisan groups
who have come up with comprehensive
bills and all sorts of legislative re-
sponses. My door is always open to
anyone who wants to sit down.
In the meantime, bring humanity to
our border. Let’s not do things with
these people presenting themselves at
our border that don’t speak well of our
values and our reputation around the
world. We can do better. We can pro-
vide humane treatment.
Even as Congress fails to do its job,
those people at the border deserve to be
treated like human beings as we work
through our legal issues and our polit-
ical issues. No more separation of chil-
dren from their parents. How dev-
astating it must be for that child.
When some of these parents were re-
united with their children—these little
babies and infants—the young kids
wouldn’t talk to their mothers. They
turned away from them. With their
body language, they said what we knew
was going through their minds: You
abandoned me. You left me. I don’t
know who you are anymore.
Over time, maybe they can reestab-
lish that relationship. Child psycholo-
gists tell us there could be some dam-
age that needs to be repaired there.
Isn’t that a shame, that an innocent
child would go through that experi-
ence?
Now that we know there may be 1,712
more of these children, we need to do
everything we can to work with this
Federal judge, who had the courage to
step up, to reunite them with their par-
ents as quickly as possible.
In the meantime, I want to call on
this administration and the Acting
Secretary of the Department of Home-
land Security, Kevin McAleenan, to go
down to the border, take a look at the
detention facilities, and do everything
possible to make certain there is hu-
mane treatment there. These are des-
perate people risking their lives to
come to this United States of America.
We owe them at least humane treat-
ment while they are here, as our polit-
ical and legal system works its way
through it.
(Mr. CRUZ assumed the Chair.)
ABORTION
Mr. President, people are following
what is happening in States like Ala-
bama, Georgia, and Mississippi, where
State legislatures are considering leg-
islation on the issue of abortion.
I know this is a very inflammatory
and divisive issue. I have seen it first-
hand throughout my political career. I
have good friends who are on one side
of the issue, who smile and say hello
but wouldn’t vote for me in 100 years
because of this issue. I have others who
passionately support me because they
are on the other side of the issue. For
some people, it really is the litmus test
on how they will vote for a candidate.
For over 40 years, we have tried to
reconcile this issue, this basic ques-
tion: When does life begin? In Roe v.
Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court said: We
are going to base it on the concept of
viability, survivability of the fetus, as
to an individual’s right when it comes
to making this decision as opposed to
society’s right or responsibility.
Over the years, there has been a lot
of debate as to whether that Roe v.
Wade decision was right or wrong. We
have seen a lot of different efforts to
change it—some successful and some
not—and we have seen subsequent Su-
preme Court cases which redefined Roe
v. Wade as well.
Now we have a group who believes
they can move forward on this in the
State of Georgia and in the State of
Alabama. What they have proposed is
much different from what we had ac-
cepted as the norm for decades. For ex-
ample, they have eliminated any ex-
ceptions for rape and incest. Most peo-
ple understand that victims of rape and
incest should be viewed differently
from others, but in the State of Ala-
bama, they eliminated those excep-
tions in the law they have just passed.
Why are they doing that now when
Federal courts in the past have—in the
immediate past—decided they can’t go
that far? It is because they believe that
because of the actions of the U.S. Sen-
ate, it is going to change in the courts.
This President has appointed two new
Justices to the Supreme Court—
Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. The belief is,
even though they have told us over and
over again that Roe v. Wade was set-
tled law, if this new law in Alabama

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2994 May 21, 2019
makes it across the street to the Su-
preme Court, they may use this Ala-
bama law to overturn Roe v. Wade.
On a regular basis here, we continue
to bring judges before us who have ex-
treme views on this subject and, with-
out much debate, give them lifetime
appointments to the Federal bench—
district and circuit court judges, sev-
eral of whom are before us this week.
I have heard from them in the com-
mittees. Just last week, we had Judge
Vitter from Louisiana. She is a person
who has blamed Planned Parenthood
for deaths and has said at one point
that she believes that contraception—
the pill—was dangerous to women.
That was her conclusion without sci-
entific evidence to back it.
She just got a lifetime appointment
to the Federal bench. Those are the
kinds of nominees who are brought to
us by this administration. So is it any
wonder that the Alabama legislators
were encouraged to think, if we can
pass this law and just get it to the
right Federal judge, somebody under
the Trump administration, we are
going to overturn Roe v. Wade? I think
that would be a serious mistake if it
happens.
The overwhelming majority of Amer-
icans support Roe v. Wade. Yet a total
of 30 States have now sought to restrict
the rights of women to make that
healthcare decision, and some would
directly or virtually reverse Roe v.
Wade. What we are facing is not a few
far-right politicians making a state-
ment out of mainstream. This is a sys-
tematic effort by Republicans and
State legislators to restrict women’s
reproductive rights and ultimately
overturn Roe v. Wade.
What else do these State legislators
have in common? They rank among the
lowest when it comes to gender rep-
resentation and women in power.
Meanwhile, here in the Senate, Repub-
lican Leader MCCONNELL has lined up
even more extreme ideological judicial
nominees who have records of restrict-
ing women’s rights.
Just last week, as I mentioned, the
Republican majority confirmed Ms.
Wendy Vitter, who once promoted the
concept that contraceptives cause can-
cer and claimed that Planned Parent-
hood kills 150,000 women a year. That
anyone can make those statements and
then be approved by this Senate Cham-
ber for a lifetime appointment to a
Federal bench tells you the standards
being used by the Trump administra-
tion and by the Republicans in this
body. She was confirmed to a lifetime
appointment.
This week, the Senate is considering
Mr. Daniel Collins, who has been nomi-
nated to the Ninth Circuit over the ob-
jections of both California Senators. He
filed an amicus brief in support of
Hobby Lobby petitions to deny female
employees of that corporation contra-
ceptive care, and he has argued that
pregnancy clinics need not follow a
local notification law informing pa-
tients about their options when it
comes to birth control.
Also, this week, we are considering
North Carolina district court nominee
Kenneth Bell, who once wrote in an op-
ed, and I quote, ‘‘There is no middle
ground’’ on this issue of abortion.
Missouri district nominee Stephen
Clark is before us as well. He spent
much of his legal career litigating
against reproductive rights and access
to contraceptives.
These are the nominees to take life-
time appointments on the Federal
court. You have to bring together the
action of Alabama with the action on
the floor of the U.S. Senate. Alabama
is setting up the test case. The Repub-
licans in the Senate are setting up the
courts in the hopes that they will rule
in their test case to put an end to Roe
v. Wade and to say that despite the
support of a majority of Americans,
women do not have the last word when
it comes to their own bodies, their own
lives, and their own pregnancies.
That is what this is about today in
America on our political scene. That is
certainly what the next election is all
about, as well—division of America,
the rights of women, and the rights of
individuals to make their own deci-
sions about their own bodies.
I hope that the Republican leaders
who have expressed their misgivings
about the Alabama legislation will do
much more than that. I hope they will
join us in trying to maintain some
sort—if not a consensus, some sort of
understanding about how we deal with
this extremely divisive issue.
TRIBUTE TO ROBERT KING
Mr. President, in a sermon on the
Good Samaritan, Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., said that most people who
come upon a stranger in need ask: ‘‘If
I stop to help this man, what will hap-
pen to me?’’
But the Good Samaritan reverses the
question and asks: ‘‘If I do not stop to
help this man, what will happen to
him?’’
The latter person is rare and special,
Dr. King said. On the Saturday before
Easter, that special person was another
man named Robert King of Chicago.
Mr. King was driving on heavily trav-
eled Lake Shore Drive, which passes
right in front of my apartment, when
he saw a green and white van on the
side of the road. Another vehicle had
crashed into that van at a stoplight.
The van was a wreck.
Many cars passed the accident and
did nothing, but Robert King didn’t.
Mr. King pulled over to stop and see if
he could help. He noticed that the man
in the van held a cooler and thought he
might be delivering food. King was
stunned to find out that the van was an
organ transplant vehicle and the man
in the van was an organ transplant sur-
geon, Dr. Kofi Atiemo. Inside the cool-
er were three precious human organs—
a liver, a kidney, and a pancreas—that
needed to be rushed to nearby North-
western Memorial Hospital as soon as
possible.
Robert King, a passerby, stopped to
help one stranger in need. He ended up
helping to save two lives. Those pre-
cious organs were the final magnani-
mous gift of a young woman who died
too soon and had the heart to donate
her organs. One patient at North-
western received her liver and kidney,
while her pancreas went to another pa-
tient at a separate hospital.
The president and CEO of Gift of
Hope Organ and Tissue Donor Network,
Kevin Smunt, put it best: ‘‘Here was
just a regular Chicagoan’’—this Robert
King—‘‘who, through the kindness of
his heart, helped us honor a donor fam-
ily who was kind enough to donate the
most precious gift anyone can ever
give.’’
At the Chicago Organ Summit’s an-
nual gathering, government officials,
doctors, advocates, and families of do-
nors gathered last month and honored
Robert King for his act of kindness,
which saved lives and told his story to
the world. The two people who were
helped by Robert King’s thoughtfulness
are among an estimated 113,000 men
and women and children in America
who are living and waiting and hoping
for organs to reach them. Every 10
minutes, another person is added to
that list. Every day, sadly, 20 people
die waiting for a transplant.
The human body contains eight or-
gans that can be transplanted to save
lives—the heart, two lungs, two kid-
neys, a pancreas, a liver, and intes-
tines. And here is the hope: Each of us
can choose to save up to eight lives by
becoming an organ donor.
The world needs Good Samaritans. It
needs more Robert Kings and more
organ donors.
I yield the floor.

MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, this
month is Mental Health Awareness
Month, and the goal of Mental Health
Awareness Month is to recognize the
importance for personal well-being, the
need for research and education, dispel-
ling the stigmas associated with men-
tal illness, and to improve mental
healthcare to ensure that care is avail-
able to ensure that the first episode of
mental illness is the last.
A goal with Mental Health Aware-
ness Month is the awareness that is
necessary for the programs to be imple-
mented so that that young person with
their first episode is returned to whole-
ness, and, again, as I said earlier, the
first episode is the last. It recognizes
that mental health is a societal issue
associated with homelessness, crime,
suicide, physical health, and public
health issues.
Now, when you speak of mental
health, it is a little bit almost like: Oh,
my gosh, this is going to be a futile
issue. It is so difficult for someone who
has serious mental illness to return
them to wholeness. It is so difficult
that sometimes the individual, their
family, and society throws up their
hands and says: There is nothing to do,
so why try.
You see manifestations of that with
the homeless people walking around
this city and every city in the United
States, many of whom are mentally ill;
yet there can be hope.
I called a person back home from
Baton Rouge, LA, and asked her for a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2997

story, if you will, of how someone with
mental illness issues can be returned to
wholeness, so let me tell you about
Mary. When you walk with Mary, you
can’t help but feel happy, happy,
happy. That is because Mary radiates
the joy of how Capital Area Human
Services helped change her life.
Mary says:
I go out and help the community every
day. I became successful in my life because
of my faith in God and because of the won-
derful people at Capital Area Human Serv-
ices. Today I give back to the community
what Capital Area has given to me.
It wasn’t always this way. For nearly
20 years before being referred to Cap-
ital Area Human Services, Mary lived
in group homes and was dependent
upon others for basic needs.
I am now quoting Mary:
I weighed 340 pounds. I was sick all the
time, was in and out of hospitals. I was bare-
ly able to function. I was on so many medi-
cines I could not keep track.
When Mary came to Capital Area
Human Services in 2006, she was first
helped at the Margaret Dumas Center
at the Government Street location.
She eventually entered the total health
program, and even more dramatic
changes began.
Now, let me point out as a physi-
cian—I am a doctor—I have learned
from folks such as the people I am
quoting now that mental health is
often associated with physical health
problems. So someone who is seriously
mentally ill is more likely to die in
their 50s than they are in their 80s with
untreated hypertension, diabetes, or
perhaps, because they are homeless,
subject to violence on the streets.
So let me now go back to Mary’s
story. When she entered the total
health program, she lost nearly 100
pounds, no longer needed to take blood
pressure medicine, changed her diet,
participated in fitness programs, and
continued to attend mental health
therapy sessions.
Today Mary is a different person. She
lives independently in her own apart-
ment, attends Sacred Heart of Jesus
Catholic Church, walks 2 hours every
day to volunteer for various duties at
the St. Agnes Catholic Church soup
kitchen, where she also sings for the
attendees. Mary credits the nuns at St.
Agnes for teaching her how to cook,
prepare meals, and serve.
Also, Mary is a regular volunteer at
the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and
at the Baton Rouge General Hospital
chapel, where she reads Scriptures for
some of the services.
Mary said she loves Capital Area
Human Services, tells everyone she
knows about the people who helped
her, particularly Kesha, John, the staff
at Margaret Dumas, the staff at the
Government Street location, and
former total health employees Roy and
Ricky.
She says:
I was motivated and didn’t give up. It
made me happy to do this for myself. I
proved that I could do it, and I’m doing it.
It’s winter, but I’m out there anyway.
Now, I give that kind of personal
story to give an example of someone
with serious mental illness returned to
wholeness. Now, I love that because I
always tell folks when I speak that we
in Washington, DC, can propose legisla-
tion, but unless there is local leader-
ship, nothing good happens.
In 2016, I collaborated with CHRIS
MURPHY, as well as EDDIE BERNICE
JOHNSON and Tim Murphy in the House,
to pass the Mental Health Reform Act.
It increased access to mental
healthcare for adults and children, it
strengthened leadership and account-
ability for Federal mental health and
substance abuse programs, and it es-
tablished new programs for early inter-
vention. It was called by Senator ALEX-
ANDER the largest reform to our mental
health system in decades. I continue to
work with President Trump’s adminis-
tration to implement these reforms.
Now, none of this Federal legislation
makes a difference unless there is
State and local leadership, as was dem-
onstrated in the story which I gave.
Last October, I held a mental health
summit in Baton Rouge and brought
together Federal, State, and local lead-
ers, and the purpose was to discuss
proven methods in how to work to-
gether to improve the provision of
mental health services in both Lou-
isiana and the United States.
There is still important work to do.
If we are going to return these folks to
wholeness, these folks—our family
members, our neighbors, our fellow
Americans.
The Mental Health Parity bill be-
came law 10 years ago, but patients
still have trouble accessing mental
healthcare in the same way they access
physical healthcare, caused by, among
other things, the lack of mental health
providers, prior authorization require-
ments, and reimbursement rate set-
ting. I am committed to ensuring pa-
tients have access to the treatment so
they return to wholeness.
We need the story of Mary not to be
something so unusual that it is read
upon the Senate floor, but something
which is so common that we know it to
be true. Instead of throwing up our
hands—kind of, oh, my gosh, serious
mental illness; there is nothing to do—
instead we look to hope with a future
for someone who could be returned to
wholeness so that her first episode of
mental illness is her last episode of
mental illness.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia.
MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH
Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, May
is Military Appreciation Month. In
light of that, I come to the Senate
floor to remind us all just how impor-
tant our military is to our way of life.
One of the blessings of being a U.S.
Senator and being on the Armed Serv-
ices Committee and a past member of
the Foreign Relations Committee, I
have had the privilege to travel, as you
have, around the world, visiting with
our men and women in uniform.
I have concluded that the best—and I
mean the very best—of what we
produce here in America is in uniform
around the world, worn by our women
and men, protecting our interests and
defending freedom around the world.
There are only six reasons in the Dec-
laration of Independence why 13 Colo-
nies got together in the first place, and
one of those was to provide for the
common defense.
Today, the world is more dangerous
than any time in my lifetime. Today,
the United States faces five threats
across five domains. This is much more
complicated than the world has ever
seen. Today, we measure the threats in
this manner: China, Russia, North
Korea, Iran, and terrorism across five
domains.
It used to be air, land, and sea. Un-
fortunately, today, it is air, land, sea,
cyber, and now space. The tragedy,
frankly, of our time is we have treated
space as a scientific endeavor over the
last 30 years, and others who we now
consider potential threats have treated
it as a military domain.
I grew up in a military town. My fa-
ther served in Germany during World
War II. When World War II was ended,
he joined the Reserves and then was
called up again in the Korean war. He
spent a couple of years in Korea during
the Korean war. I have his dog tags
today in my office. They serve as a
constant reminder of his commitment
to defending our ideals and upholding
our way of life here in America. It re-
minds me that every single woman and
man in uniform in our services today
do the same thing.
Today, I am humbled to represent
our men and women in uniform in the
United States Armed Services Com-
mittee. I take that very seriously, as I
know every member does. One of my
greatest honors as a member of this
committee and a former member of the
Foreign Relations Committee, as I
said, is to travel overseas. The high-
light in every one of those trips is not
meeting with the head of state or the
head of the military or the foreign
minister; it was having dinner with
people from my home State who were
in uniform around the world.
When President Obama was in office,
the No. 1 request I heard from heads of
state around the world was: We need
America to reengage.
At that time, America had with-
drawn. We had created a vacuum. Peo-
ple weren’t asking us to be the world’s
policeman. They were asking us to ba-
sically reengage and have a seat at the
table and lead again. After a decade of
withdrawal from the world stage under
the prior administration, America is
now leading again.
President Trump is reengaged with
the rest of the world. He has made it
clear that America’s interest comes
first. When we say America first, it
doesn’t mean America alone. Today,
our allies trust us again, and our ad-
versaries fear us again. President
Trump has also taken action to rebuild

our military after it was gutted during
the prior administration. Under Presi-
dent Obama, spending on the military
was cut 25 percent, and we saw the re-
sulting drop in our readiness.
In the last 2 years, we have updated
defense spending by $80 billion a year.
As a result, in addition, we have avoid-
ed the use of continuing resolutions in
each of the last 2 years, thanks to peo-
ple on both sides of the aisle—Senator
LEAHY and Senator SHELBY, who are
the ranking member and the chair of
the Appropriations Committee—who
worked diligently last year and made
sure that we got defense funding done
before the end of the fiscal year and
without a continuing resolution.
Because of that, readiness is on the
rise again in the military. Moderniza-
tion efforts and rebuilding our military
are underway, and our men and women
in uniform are safer around the world,
No. 1, and have the resources they need
to carry out their mission.
I am proud of the progress that we
have made in just a very short period
of time. Just in the last 2 years, our
readiness has dramatically improved.
However, a continuing resolution of
any length for fiscal year 2020 will
erode and undo a lot of progress we
have made just in readiness over the
last couple of years.
I am really very concerned that this
is a primary responsibility of ours here
in the Senate and, indeed, in Congress,
and it is one we have not stood up to in
the past. We have got to do better than
that this year.
I believe that Secretary of the Navy,
Richard Spencer, said it best when he
described the impact of continuing res-
olutions. Since the 1974 Budget Act was
put into place, Congress has used 187
continuing resolutions as a release
valve to fund the government in a tem-
porary manner.
Let me say that again, since 1974, 45
years, we have used 187 continuing res-
olutions. Each one of those continuing
resolutions is devastating to our mili-
tary in so many ways that I will get
into in just a minute. Continuing reso-
lutions are absolutely devastating to
our military, both in readiness and the
ability to rebuild our military. It is the
most insidious thing Congress can do
to our men and women in uniform.
Many of us here don’t even realize the
damage that continuing resolutions do
to our military.
I have questioned all three current
service Secretaries and their chiefs of
staff, both publicly and in private
meetings, about the operational im-
pacts of continuing resolutions and
funding uncertainty.
Here are some of the responses:
A continuing resolution ‘‘would be
like a punch in the gut,’’ according to
ADM John Richardson, Chief of Naval
Operations.
A continuing resolution ‘‘would stall
our progress on readiness and mod-
ernization,’’ said Gen. Bob Neller, Com-
mandant of the U.S. Marine Corps.
Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air
Force, said that the defense budget se-
quester ‘‘did more damage to the
United States Air Force and our ability
to defend the nation than anything our
adversaries have done in the last 10
years—and we did it to ourselves.’’
Secretary of the Army Mark Esper
said:
Fiscal uncertainty has done a great deal to
erode our readiness and hamper our ability
to modernize. . . . If we do not modernize the
force right now, we risk losing a future con-
flict against Russia or China. It’s just that
simple.
Finally, Secretary of the Navy Rich-
ard Spencer said, and this is classic:
Continuing resolutions have cost the De-
partment of the Navy roughly $4 billion. . . .
Since 2011, we have put $4 billion in a trash
can, put lighter fluid on top of it and burned
it.
I don’t know how to put it more
clearly than that.
CRs have a direct and immediate im-
pact across the entire Department of
Defense—from training, to readiness,
to maintenance, to personnel, and, yes,
to contracting.
During a CR, training must be
rescoped, scaled back, or discontinued
entirely, which means our warfighters
are less prepared for battle and don’t
have the resources to defend them-
selves properly when in the heat of bat-
tle.
Depot maintenance and weapons de-
velopment are delayed, resulting in
costly delays, less lethality, and higher
costs.
Hiring and recruitment are put on
pause, leaving critical gaps in work-
force skill sets.
We have the development of cyber ca-
pability and space capabilities now. We
are just ginning up those capabilities,
and CRs absolutely devastate these
young, developing capabilities.
Change-of-station moves for service-
members and their families are halted,
creating unnecessary turmoil for fami-
lies. Can you imagine that you have
kids, and you are going to be deployed
overseas. The timing has to be right to
get your kids in schools over there.
Well, if a CR happens to occur—and
guess what happens around September
30. The end of our fiscal year. If your
family is moving around that period of
time, it could be held up because of
that CR. That is very disconcerting to
families already stressed by increased
deployments and rapid turnarounds.
The DOD cannot start new contracts
or in many cases has to cancel existing
ones. That devastates the supply chain.
When we look at the supply chain in
the military, after the devastating dis-
investment of the last administration,
one of the things that have to be re-
built is the supply chain. The con-
sistent funding of the supply chain is
critical to the long-term defense of this
country, and it is one we have taken
for granted and have devastated over
the last decade.
Additionally, the Department of De-
fense has outlined hundreds of critical
projects that would be disrupted or
even discontinued if a current CR is
used this year. I can think of one right
now. A very much in demand heli-
copter has been under development for
the last few years. It is ready to go. It
is ready to be sent to the troops in the
field. Yet, if we have a CR come Sep-
tember 30, it will be delayed 1 full year.
We cannot allow this any longer.
Clearly, CRs create inefficiencies and
uncertainty that hurt the bottom line
and our ability to fight. These funding
disruptions weaken our strategic capa-
bility and shake the confidence and
foundation of our Nation’s industrial
base.
Until 2018, the Department of Defense
started 13 of the last 17 years under a
continuing resolution. Thirteen of the
last 17 years, they started their fiscal
year under a continuing resolution.
Fortunately, for the last 2 years, de-
spite other funding failures of Con-
gress, we did not have to use a CR to
fund the military. That has been a
major factor in boosting readiness and
our reinvestment and recap efforts.
I hate to say it, but I believe we are
staring down the barrel of a potential
CR on September 30 this year. As we sit
here tonight, there are only 25 working
days between now and July 31. Why is
that important? Because in the month
of August, this body, along with the
House, goes back to their States, and it
is a work period in those States. That
means we will not be able to pass ap-
propriations bills here because we will
not be here.
If we don’t move this appropriations
bill and get it passed by the end, I be-
lieve, of July, when we come back in
September, there will be only 10 work-
ing days, legislative working days, and
there is no way we are going to get it
all funded in that time.
Last year, on July 31, we had only ap-
propriated about 121⁄2 percent of the
Federal discretionary budget. We
stayed here in August, to the credit of
the leadership, Senator MCCONNELL. I
believe that because of that, we went
from 121⁄2 percent to 75 percent funding,
including the Department of Defense,
and therefore we were able to avoid a
continuing resolution last year, as I
have said.
Other people have said that the
greatest threat to our national secu-
rity is our own national debt—General
Mattis, Admiral Mullen. There are var-
ious other people who have said that
who are in a position where they
should know. I would add one thing to
that that is devastating to our ability
to defend this country, and that is the
use of continuing resolutions.
When we look at the domain threats
and the natural threats that have
evolved in the world right now—China,
Russia, Iran, North Korea, and ter-
rorism—I don’t think any of that dam-
ages the military, potentially, as much
as our inability here to provide con-
sistent funding for our military.
During Military Appreciation Month,
I can think of no higher calling than
for Congress to work diligently on
passing a defense appropriations bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2999
May 21, 2019
First, we have to pass the National De-
fense Authorization Act, which we are
working on this week. All the sub-
committees are passing their markups
this week. We hope to move on that
immediately. I believe that will get
passed here without much controversy.
I know that leadership right now is
talking about moving in a very intense
manner, with a critical sense of ur-
gency, to get this Defense appropria-
tions bill done. I applaud those efforts.
I want to support it in any way I can.
I call on everybody in this body to be
supportive of making sure that we can
have, for the third year in a row—this
is not a partisan issue; this is about
our men and women in uniform. Given
that this month is Military Apprecia-
tion Month, what better time to face
up to this potential and make sure that
we don’t have a continuing resolution
come September 30 of this year. That is
the least we can do for our women and
men in uniform. And we can fulfill the
responsibility our Founders laid out in
the Declaration of Independence when
they outlined those six reasons why we
were coming together, and the No. 1
reason we had at that time was to pro-
vide for the security of the United
States of America.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas.
Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President,
first, before my colleague from Georgia
leaves, I want to thank him for his
strong statement on the fact that we
have to do defense appropriations.
I know that the Presiding Officer cer-
tainly knows all about this, given her
Active-Duty service on behalf of our
Nation.
As he has pointed out, every service
has been affected by this. Speaking for
the U.S. Marine Corps, part of the Ma-
rine Caucus that we have here, and
talking with Bob Neller, who is our re-
tiring Commandant—he has pointed
out specifically that they don’t have
enough to do—I mean, we are proud of
the Marine Corps. I always say we do
more with less, but this time, you can’t
do more with less and then less and
then less, and that is precisely where
we are.
I thank the Senator for making an
outstanding statement. I join him in
this plea on a bipartisan basis to get
these appropriations bills done.
Thank you.
NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH
Madam President, I rise today, along
with many of my colleagues, in rec-
ognition of National Mental Health
Awareness Month.
We on the Senate Agriculture Com-
mittee have worked extensively on
mental health issues, fighting for im-
proved mental health services and
mental health parity, especially in our
rural and smalltown areas. We have
made great strides over the years in
improving access to mental health
services and eliminating the stigma of
seeking treatment. However, as we
continue to see violent tragedies
around the country resulting from in-
dividuals with mental illness, or even
solely looking at suicide rates, which
continue to increase—let me point out
that in Kansas, there were over 500 sui-
cides in 2016 alone. If the figures were
available, I am sure that would be in-
creased, especially with the problems
we have in farm country, where we are
going through a very rough patch—a
fifth year of prices below the cost of
production. There is a lot of stress out
there in farm country. All of this
shows me that more can certainly be
done to address the deficiencies in our
current system.
Kansas has one suicide prevention
lifeline crisis center, located in Law-
rence, KS. That is to assist people ex-
periencing mental health crises from
the entire State. In many of our rural
areas, we continue to struggle with
providing adequate access to mental
health services.
Those facts apply just for those pa-
tients who seek out care. Too many
times, people struggling with mental
health are either unaware that they
can seek help, or they are simply un-
willing to do so because of the stigma
that is often associated with mental
illness. That is why we need to take
the opportunity not just this month
but every day going forward to improve
awareness and understanding about
mental health.
The same can be said for addiction.
On the Agriculture Committee, we are
all proud to have played a role in the
passage of the SUPPORT for Patients
and Communities Act last year to help
address the opioid crisis. However,
Kansas is still facing significant chal-
lenges with meth addiction. We fought
the good fight to eliminate meth labs
in many of our States, and now the
cartels in Mexico have much more
virulence—if I can use that term—with
regard to meth.
I am currently working on legisla-
tion to help extend the reach of impor-
tant, often lifesaving treatments for
addiction to folks in our rural areas.
We can improve mental and behavioral
well-being while continuing to reduce
the stigma associated with seeking out
mental health and addiction treat-
ment.
Additionally, having the privilege of
being the chairman of the Agriculture
Committee and speaking for my rank-
ing member, Senator STABENOW, as
well, you have probably heard me say
that we have been in a rough patch in
farm country over the past several
years. That is certainly true. However,
those of us who represent farm country
can be more reticent to discuss the toll
these troubled times take on farmers,
ranchers, growers, and their families,
who work tirelessly each day to
produce the food and fiber for the
United States and a troubled and hun-
gry world.
Farmers, ranchers, and growers face
highly demanding working conditions
on a good day but more especially dur-
ing a time of lower prices. As I have in-
dicated, it is the fifth year of prices
being below the cost of production. So
we see mitigation payments coming
out of the Department of Agriculture.
Historically, there have been efforts
made by Congress to address these con-
cerns, including the programs that
took place during the 1980s farm cri-
sis—I was in the House of Representa-
tives at that particular time; those
were very tough times—and recogni-
tion of this issue in the 2008 farm bill.
As we began the 2018 farm bill proc-
ess, we looked for opportunities to ad-
dress this pressing issue, and it led to
renewal of the Farm and Ranch Stress
Assistance Network. Members on both
sides of the aisle in the Capitol recog-
nize the importance of a nationwide
Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance
Network. It provides support for all
producers, farmers, ranchers, and their
families through partnerships with or-
ganizations in their local communities.
Local communities are stepping up,
but in terms of getting that network
applied, that is another story.
This network recognizes the State
and local organizations that have been
addressing behavioral health concerns
for farmers and ranchers and author-
izes grants to support the programs
that assist those who are in crisis, es-
pecially during this month when we are
addressing this topic.
We have just heard from the distin-
guished Senator from Georgia about
the need to avoid a CR in terms of a
national defense, and that is true, but
in this particular case, it is authorized,
but it is subject to appropriations.
On this particular issue, to prevent
suicides and mental health illness from
resulting in a tragedy, not only in our
cities, not only in other States, but
across our rural and smalltown areas,
it is exceedingly important that we
fund this so that we can get the Farm
and Ranch Stress Assistance Network
up and running and provide the help
they really need.
Thank you.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3000 May 21, 2019
CONFIRMATION OF DANIEL
COLLINS
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President,
I rise today in opposition to the nomi-
nation of Daniel Collins to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.
Mr. Collins had been nominated to a
California seat on the Ninth Circuit
over the objections of Senator HARRIS
and myself. Neither Senator HARRIS
nor I returned blue slips for Mr. Col-
lins, yet the majority moved forward
with his nomination, disregarding our
concerns.
This vote on Mr. Collins follows on
the heels of last week’s vote on Ken-
neth Lee, another Ninth Circuit nomi-
nee who lacked blue slips from me and
Senator HARRIS.
So, once again, we see the majority
violating Senate norms and traditions
by ignoring home-State Senators, in-
cluding the Judiciary Committee’s
ranking member, and stacking the
courts with ideologues.
This breakdown in Senate traditions
is harmful to all of us, Democrats and
Republicans. It is also unnecessary.
As I have highlighted before, Demo-
cratic Senators have been willing to
work with the White House to find con-
sensus picks for the circuit courts, but
that willingness has been rebuffed by
the Trump administration and dis-
regarded by the majority.
The majority’s decision to once again
ignore blue slips is short-sighted. After
all, what goes around comes around.
Senator HARRIS and I refused to re-
turn blue slips on Mr. Collins for sev-
eral reasons.
I have used a bipartisan instate
screening commission to vet potential
nominees to California district and
Ninth Circuit seats for my entire ca-
reer. These are highly respected law-
yers from throughout the State, and
they have reviewed and recommended
nominees from Democratic and Repub-
lican administrations.
My instate bipartisan commission
raised concerns about Mr. Collins’s ri-
gidity, temperament, and history of
taking positions in litigation for the
purposes of overturning precedent and
challenging legal boundaries.
The role of a judge is to be an impar-
tial arbiter, not an advocate and not
someone with an agenda, particularly
an agenda of overturning precedent.
Based on this, I am concerned that
Mr. Collins has not demonstrated and
does not embody the characteristics
that we expect of all Federal judges.
I also believe that Mr. Collins’s
record on women’s reproductive rights,
executive power, civil liberties, and
criminal justice matters puts him far
outside the judicial mainstream.
For example, Mr. Collins was a
strong advocate for the Bush adminis-
tration’s use of military commissions
to try enemy combatants held at Guan-
tanamo Bay. He even went so far as to
argue that the President’s authority as
Commander-in-Chief allowed him to
bypass Congress and create these com-
missions without congressional ap-
proval.
Mr. Collins also wrote a law review
piece in which he argued that Miranda
v. Arizona, a longstanding Supreme
Court precedent that protects the
rights of individuals, should be over-
turned.
For the last decade, Mr. Collins has
also defended numerous chemical and
energy companies in lawsuits brought
by homeowners, Tribes, and local gov-
ernments. The plaintiffs in these law-
suits have argued that these companies
contributed to climate change and its
effects, such as increasing the severity
of storms and causing sea levels to rise.
In several of these lawsuits, Mr. Col-
lins argued that climate change is not
even real. For example, in a case rep-
resenting Shell Oil Company, Mr. Col-
lins wrote that ‘‘climate change alleg-
edly results from the aggregate effects
of greenhouse gas emissions from bil-
lions of sources around the world accu-
mulating in the global atmosphere over
the course of centuries, and thus it
cannot be attributed to . . . energy
companies.’’
In addition, in questions for the
record, he refused to acknowledge that
climate change is real and that human
activity contributes to it.
I understand that Mr. Collins was
representing clients in these lawsuits,
but he was the one who chose which ar-
guments to make, including arguments
that climate change is not real. We
cannot have a judge on the Ninth Cir-
cuit who denies climate change and its
impacts.
At his hearing, Mr. Collins was will-
ing to answer questions from Repub-
licans on his personal views, but not
answer similar questions from Demo-
crats.
For instance, when asked how he
‘‘feel[s] about the First Step Act,’’ Mr.
Collins said: ‘‘I think that the First
Step Act . . . appeared to me to be a
balanced approach to reform some of
the sentencing provisions which
seemed unduly harsh.’’
But when asked by Senator
BLUMENTHAL whether he believed
Brown v. Board of Education was cor-
rectly decided, Mr. Collins refused to
answer.
Nominees should not answer Repub-
lican questions and evade Democratic
ones, especially when it comes to an-
swering questions about Brown v.
Board of Education, a monumental
case whose correctness cannot and
should not be questioned and has been
answered by previous Republican nomi-
nees, including Chief Justice Roberts.
Taken as a whole, I believe Mr. Col-
lins is far outside the legal main-
stream.
Given concerns about his tempera-
ment and commitment to upholding
precedent and given the positions he
has taken on executive power, criminal
justice, and other matters that could
come before the Ninth Circuit, I cannot
support Mr. Collins.
I voted against Mr. Collins, and I
urged my colleagues to do the same.
VOTE EXPLANATION
Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, on
May 20, 2019, the Senate voted on the
motion to invoke cloture on Executive
Calendar No. 201, Daniel P. Collins, of
California, to be United States Circuit
Judge for the Ninth Circuit. Due to
travel delays, I missed this vote. How-
ever, I oppose confirming this nominee,
and I would have voted against cloture
if I were present.
f
TRIBUTE TO KEANON LOWE
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President,
today I want to recognize and honor
Parkrose High School coach and secu-
rity guard Keanon Lowe for his her-
oism during the school day on May 17,
2019.
When Mr. Lowe spotted an armed
student in a classroom in the northeast
Portland high school, he bravely tack-
led the student, wrestled away the gun,
and held the student until police ar-
rived. Mr. Lowe may have saved the
lives of countless students, teachers,
and administrators at Parkrose.
In Mr. Lowe’s own words the day
after the incident, ‘‘When I signed up
to be a security guard, football and
track and field coach for Parkrose High
School, I did so to guide and coach
young people whose shoes I had once
been in. I had no idea that I would one
day have to put my life on the line like
I did yesterday for my students.’’
Mr. Lowe is no stranger to the spot-
light. Before becoming the football and
track coach at Parkrose, Mr. Lowe was
a standout football player in Oregon at
Jesuit High School and then the Uni-
versity of Oregon, U of O, ‘‘Go Ducks!’’
As an U of O alumnus, I witnessed
Mr. Lowe’s standout play both in
Autzen Stadium in Eugene and in the
2015 national championship game
against the Ohio State University.
All Ducks fans know Mr. Lowe as a
champion on the field, and now all of
Oregon and the country, know him as a
hero off the field.
Mr. Lowe’s heroics saved the day on
a Friday morning just before noon.
Students, teachers, and administrators
at Parkrose, as well as their loved
ones, are incredibly grateful that Mr.
Lowe prevented what could have been a
tragedy in my hometown.
Sadly, far too many schools in my
State and across America have not
been so fortunate in the past few dec-
ades. Gun violence in schools has es-
sentially created a ‘‘lockdown genera-
tion’’ of students whose happy memo-
ries of high school dances, games,
plays, and other activities jostle along-
side memories of lockdown drills and,
in far too many instances, violent gun-
men.
Again, in Mr. Lowe’s own words, ‘‘I’m
blessed to be alive and extremely
happy that the students are safe. I’m
not sure what’s next, I haven’t had the
time to really think about it. But I am
sure I want to be a part of the solution
to school gun violence.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3001
May 21, 2019
I am grateful that Mr. Lowe pre-
vented the worst on May 17, 2019, and
welcome his commitment to be a team-
mate in reducing the chances of gun
tragedies in every school in America.
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President,
today, I would like to honor Keanon
Lowe’s heroism and bravery in tack-
ling a gunman at Parkrose High School
on May 17, 2019. Mr. Lowe is known for
being a top wide receiver for University
of Oregon’s football team and now as a
popular coach of football and track and
field at Parkrose High School. He also
works as a security guard at the
school.
On Friday, May 17, a distraught stu-
dent entered a Parkrose classroom
with a shotgun. Already this year, our
Nation has watched children die at the
hands of their armed classmates, in-
cluding two young men who sacrificed
their lives to stop gunmen and save
their fellow students. To prevent such
a tragedy, Mr. Lowe, in a tremendous
act of courage, tackled the armed stu-
dent and wrestled away the gun before
anyone could be injured.
Mr. Lowe put his life on the line to
protect our students. Mr. Lowe has not
only guided students on the field, but
now he has also protected them in the
classroom. He will no doubt be remem-
bered by those students for the rest of
their lives as an example of selflessness
and courage.
On behalf of all Oregonians, I express
our deepest gratitude and admiration
to Mr. Lowe, and thank him for his
service to Parkrose students, every
Parkrose family, and all Oregonians.

HONORING THE FALLEN POLICE
OFFICERS OF BUTTE-SILVERBOW
COUNTY, MONTANA
Mr. TESTER. Madam President,
today I wish to honor the memory of 18
of Butte, America’s finest.
Since 1892, 18 brave police officers
have lost their lives in the line of duty
protecting the people of Butte-
Silverbow County, the most of any
county in Montana.
These men put the lives of others
above their own, rushing into danger to
keep their community safe, and paying
the ultimate sacrifice as a result.
I want to honor: William F. Jordan;
Dennis W. Daly; Federick Kranbeck;
Fred A. Palin; John J. Streb; Joseph A.
Freshman; Charles E. Streb; Ivan W.
Lincoln; James H. Pace; Bart J. McCar-

their families and loved ones who sac-
rificed so much as well.
May their memories never be forgot-
ten. May all current and future peace
officers in Butte-Silver Bow, around
Montana, and this Nation return home
safe at the end of their watches.
TRIBUTE TO WEST VIRGINIA’S HE-
ROES AND RECOGNIZING THE
ALWAYS FREE HONOR FLIGHT
NETWORK
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President,
today I am incredibly honored to rise
and recognize a group of 23 heroic mili-
tary veterans who will travel from
West Virginia this week to visit our
Nation’s Capital as part of the 10th Al-
ways Free Honor Flight. On the occa-
sion of their visit, in which they will
see for the first time the monuments
built in their honor, I want to express
my utmost gratitude to these special
men and women for their extraordinary
bravery and patriotism and for their
noble sacrifice to help keep our coun-
try free.
I have said this time and time again:
West Virginia is one of the most patri-
otic States in this great Nation. With
one of our country’s highest per capita
rates of military servicemembers and
veterans, West Virginia is undoubtedly
one of our Nation’s most patriotic
States. According to the Department of
Defense, West Virginia had the highest
casualty rate in the Nation during the
Vietnam war, and I am so proud that
the Honor Flight will allow these West
Virginia veterans to pay homage to
their brethren at the Vietnam Wall.
The 31 veterans participating in this
week’s Always Free Honor Flight truly
embody the Mountain State’s history
and contributions to the safeguarding
of our American freedoms.
Our special West Virginians visiting
this week represent warriors from 23 to
93 years old and have traveled from all
parts of our great State, from Beckley
to Bluefield, Princeton to Cottageville,
and many places in between. In addi-
tion to our Mountain State veterans,
six veterans from Virginia and one vet-
eran from Florida will be accom-
panying their West Virginia neighbors
on the day-long adventure. Of the pa-
triots attending, one served in World
War II, two served in the Korean war,
10 served in the Vietnam war, one in
Vietnam and Desert Storm, one served
in the Cold war, one served in Desert
Storm and the Gulf war, two served in
the war in Afghanistan, and many oth-
ers served between wars.
I would especially like to recognize
our World War II veteran who will be
on this honor flight—93-year-old Allen
K. Walker who now lives in Beckley
but is originally from the Mississippi
Delta. He joined the Navy in Rosedale,
MS, in 1944. He served as a seaman first
class stationed in Pearl Harbor, HI.
Allen is a member of our Nation’s
Greatest Generation, and their sac-
rifices and valor embody American pa-
triotism. They fought in such a pivotal
war, in an era that threatened our ex-
istence as a Nation. Unfortunately, as
the years go by, we are losing so many
of our World War II veterans, and we
must show them our utmost gratitude
each and every day.
As I mentioned, we will also be joined
by veterans of the Korean, Vietnam,
Cold, and Gulf wars. They engaged in
combat all over the world. They were
Humvee mechanics, military police of-
ficers, and radio operators.
Two of our proud veterans here today
served in the Korean war. One is 86-
year-old Corporal Paul Clifford Lathey
from Cottageville, WV. He joined the
Army in 1953 in Ripley, WV. During his
time in Korea, he served in the 15th In-
fantry, 3rd Division Fox Company,
where he treated wounded soldiers in
MASH units. Our other Korean war
veteran is 90-year-old Sergeant David
Shirley Knapp, who was in the Army
from 1948–1954 and served as a combat
engineer during the Korean war.
Another veteran is Charlie R. Lam-
bert from Iaegar, WV, who served in a
variety of roles during the Vietnam
war. After he joined the Navy in 1970,
he served in a ‘‘boots on the ground’’
role in Thailand, served on the flight
deck of the USS Iwo Jima, and volun-
teered to be a member of the Brown
Water Navy or the forces that patrol
shallow inland waterways, seizing con-
traband and engaging with the enemy.
Another brave West Virginian who
served in Vietnam is Sergeant Robert
Ortiz, from Premier, WV, who served as
an infantryman in the 196th Light In-
fantry Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division
Americal.
We also have two veterans who
served in two wars, both from Virginia.
Sergeant Jackie Thornton of Narrows,
VA, who served in the Army during
both the Vietnam and Desert Storm
wars, as the chaplain’s assistant, as
well as, Sergeant Steven R. Mitchell of
Bluefield, VA, who served in the Army
in both Operation Desert Shield/Storm
and the Gulf war.
I would like to also specifically
honor the youngest veteran we have
with us today, Sergeant Austin Patrick
Coleman of Bluefield, WV. He joined
the Marines in Houston, TX, and served
his country in Helmand Province Af-
ghanistan as an infantryman, assisting
the Afghanistan National Army. An-
other veteran of the war in Afghani-
stan here today is Michael ‘‘Doc’’
Atwell of Princeton, WV. Doc served in
the Navy at Camp Dwyer in the
Helmand Province. He was attached to
the 1st Tank Battalion RCT7 as a FMF
corpsman.
Showing our appreciation to those
who have served is something that we
should do each and every day, but
today is a special day to pay tribute
and thank those who have volunteered
to put their lives on the line for our
freedoms. The memorials our honor
flight participants will visit today
serve as an important reminder to us
all that our freedoms and liberties
come at a steep cost. However, I know
our veterans will find special meaning
and potentially long-lost emotions
when they tour such touching sites.
This week’s honor flight and the con-
tinued support of our veterans would
not be possible without the dedication
of so many volunteers and caregivers. I
would like to thank Theresa Riggs, the
JROTC Cadet from Montcalm High

School, as well as the military spouses
and other family members serving as
the guardians on this year’s honor
flight. These guardians have selflessly
given their time to travel alongside our
veterans all the way from Princeton,
WV, to Washington, DC, to share this
very special journey with them.
I also commend those in the Always
Free Honor Flight Network for their
dedication to providing our veterans
with such a unique and meaningful ex-
perience. Without the diligence and
passion Dreama of Denver, president of
Always Free Honor Flight Network and
owner of Princeton, WV’s, Little Buddy
Radio, as well as Pam Coulbourne, the
coordinator of these flights, many of
our veterans would never have the op-
portunity to travel to Washington and
pay homage to the men and women
they fought beside. Dreama and Pam
launched the Always Free Honor Flight
in 2012, and every year, they continue
to make this dream a reality for many
of our West Virginia veterans.
I would also like to recognize Ser-
geant First Class Paul Dorsey, vice
president of Always Free Honor Flight
and official photographer Steve Cole-
man, who have done a tremendous job
of ensuring that our veterans receive
the recognition they deserve. Dreama,
Pam, and Steve have also dedicated
themselves to the Denver Foundation,
serving as incredible examples of how
individuals can give back to their com-
munities.
I am filled with pride every time I
meet the patriots who have served our
country, and I am so pleased to wel-
come West Virginia’s most courageous
veterans, who are all heroes, to Wash-
ington, DC. I encourage all of my col-
leagues to join me in saluting them.
They truly inspire us all as we are re-
minded of their selfless service. It is
because of their bravery that all Amer-
icans enjoy the greatest liberties and
freedoms in the world.
God bless all our servicemembers and
veterans, God bless the great State of
West Virginia, and God bless the
United States of America.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
REMEMBERING JOEL COURREGES
∑ Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I
am honored to pay tribute to Joel
Courreges, a Washingtonian, a marine,
and commander of the Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans, Chapter 5, upon his
passing.
Joel Courreges was a man who never
stopped serving his community, his
State, and his country. Joel served our
Nation as a marine in the Vietnam
war, returning with disabilities both
visible and invisible. Having seen first-
hand how difficult the transition home
can be, he made it his mission to
smooth the path for his fellow veterans
as they returned from service. Joel be-
came the commander of the Disabled
American Veterans, Chapter 5, in
Bremerton, WA. In this role, he not
only dedicated countless hours to help-
ing veterans file claims with the VA
and making sure they could make their
appointments, he even drove them him-
self if they couldn’t get there on their
own.
But that wasn’t all. As Joel saw what
more and more veterans were going
through, he realized the system wasn’t
working. Too many veterans, espe-
cially those with PTSD and other
wounds of war beneath the surface,
were getting caught up in courts that
didn’t understand their unique needs
and weren’t prepared or designed to
help them get back on their feet. Be-
cause of Joel’s drive and vision, the
Kitsap County Veterans Court was cre-
ated, with the goal of helping the men
and women who sacrificed to defend
our freedoms get a hand up when they
were most in need.
Having seen Joel’s efforts firsthand, I
know without a doubt that his dedica-
tion to public service lifted countless
others, especially veterans who have
given our country so much, and helped
them lead the fulfilling lives they de-
serve. I will always be grateful to Joel
for his kindness, his generosity of spir-
it, and his determination to make a
difference. My thoughts are with his
family and all those who loved him.∑

TRIBUTE TO DAVID FITZ-GERALD
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Madam President,
today I wish to recognize David Fitz-
Gerald and congratulate him on his
term as the chair of the ESOP Associa-
tion. David has been committed to ad-
vancing the employee ownership model
in Vermont and around the country.
For the last 2 years, David served as
chair of the association, working to
promote the interests of employee
stock ownership plan, ESOP, compa-
nies across the country.
In my State of Vermont, we have
seen firsthand the many benefits that
employee ownership can bring to busi-
nesses and employees. Study after
study has shown that employee owner-
ship has been proven to spur employ-
ment, increase productivity, grow
sales, and raise wages. During the last
two recessions, companies with ESOPs
were twice as likely to survive the
downturn.
David has been a vital ally in the ef-
forts to expand broad-based employee
ownership and bolster middle-class jobs
in our communities. As chair, David
advocated for the ESOP business model
and the benefits of worker ownership
all across the country. I know many in
the employee ownership community
are so appreciative of David’s energy,
motivation, and empowerment. Over
the last 2 years, David dedicated much
of his time and energy to expanding
broad-based employee ownership to
help create a sustainable economy that
benefits all of us.
In addition to his work as chair of
the ESOP Association, David serves as
a trustee for the Employee Ownership
Foundation, working to promote em-
ployee ownership. He is a leader in the
Vermont employee ownership commu-
nity and has been a crucial ally in our
fight to expand employee ownership in
our state and throughout the country.
As we continue to work together to
help the employee ownership model re-
alize its true potential, I know David
will continue to be an invaluable part-
ner.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–61. A resolution adopted by the House
of Representatives of the State of Michigan
urging the United States Congress to speed-
ily approve the recently negotiated United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement; to the
Committee on Finance.
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 81
Whereas, The North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) is a close tri-lateral re-
lationship between the United States, Can-
ada, and Mexico. For more than 25 years,
NAFTA has been economically, culturally
and strategically important for all parties;
and
Whereas, NAFTA is significant for the
American economy. Trade with Canada and
Mexico supports nearly 12 million American
jobs, and nearly 5 million of those jobs are
supported by increased NAFTA trade. Since
the agreement began in 1994, trade with Can-
ada and Mexico has nearly quadrupled to $1.3
trillion, and the two countries buy more
than one-third of U.S. merchandise exports.
U.S. service exports to Canada and Mexico
have also tripled, rising from $27.5 billion in
1993 to $91.3 billion in 2017, thanks to the
trade agreement’s new market access and
clearer rules; and
Whereas, Trade with Canada and Mexico is
significant to U.S. states. For 43 states, our
contiguous international neighbors represent

the first or second largest export market,
and all but one state counts Canada or Mex-
ico as a top three trading partner. Canada is
Michigan’s largest export market, and Mex-
ico is Michigan’s third largest export mar-
ket. NAFTA has also contributed to a 300
percent increase in Michigan’s agricultural
exports to Canada and Mexico; and
Whereas, Small and medium-sized enter-
prises in the United States rely on trade
with Canada and Mexico to support and grow
their business. Canada and Mexico are the
top two export destinations for U.S. small
and medium-sized enterprises, more than
125,000 of which sold their goods and services
in Canada and Mexico in 2014; and
Whereas, Trade among our North Amer-
ican trading partners is made up predomi-
nantly of intellectual property (IP)-intensive
goods and services that employ millions of
Americans in high paying jobs and generate
billions of dollars in economic output. How-
ever, many of the IP-intensive goods, serv-
ices, and exchanges through which trade is
facilitated did not exist when the agreement
was drafted. This situation has resulted in
uneven and weak IP enforcement. Stronger
enforcement of IP rights will encourage
more foreign direct investment and increase
gross domestic product; and
Whereas, The United States-Mexico-Can-
ada Agreement (USMCA) creates a 21st Cen-
tury trade agreement for North America.
The renegotiated USMCA has provisions fa-
vorable to U.S. autoworkers that would help
level the playing field between U.S. and
Mexican autoworkers. The updated agree-
ment is also more beneficial to the agricul-
tural sector than NAFTA and will offer a
higher degree of certainty and stability to
Michigan farmers. The new IP provisions are
the most comprehensive of any multilateral
U.S. trade agreement and are vastly superior
to those included in NAFTA; and
Whereas, A seamless transition between
NAFTA and the USMCA will ensure that
none of the benefits in trade accomplished by
the integration of the three North American
economies will be lost: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives,
That we urge the Congress of the United
States to speedily approve the recently nego-
tiated United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment; and be it further
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be
transmitted to the President of the United
States Senate, the Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives, and the
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation.
POM–62. A resolution adopted by the Com-
missioner’s Court of Grayson County, Texas,
urging the United States Congress to des-
ignate the Butterfield Overland Trail as a
National Historic Trail; to the Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. WYDEN:
S. 1569. A bill to amend the Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971 to allow
certain expenditures for cybersecurity-
related services or assistance; to the
Committee on Rules and Administra-
tion.
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I
am introducing the Federal Campaign
Cybersecurity Assistance Act of 2019—a
bulky name for a bill that attempts to
do a simply stated thing: protect our
democracy from foreign cyber attacks.
This bill allows the national campaign
committees to provide much-needed
cybersecurity assistance to State polit-
ical parties, Federal campaign offices’
staffs, and Federal candidates’ personal
accounts and devices.
In 2015 and 2016, hackers working for
the Russian government penetrated the
networks of the Democratic National
Committee and the Democratic Con-
gressional Campaign Committee. The
hackers also compromised the email
account of Senator Hillary Clinton’s
presidential campaign manager, John
Podesta. The Russian government sub-
sequently leaked and weaponized
Democratic party and campaign emails
in order to influence the outcome of
several elections—most publicly, the
presidential race between Donald
Trump and Hillary Clinton, but also
U.S. House of Representatives races in
Illinois, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsyl-
vania. Hackers also targeted Repub-
licans during the same period, but were
less successful in their efforts.
The impact of Russia’s hacking-en-
abled influence campaign was a sur-
prise to many. However, this was not
the first time that a foreign govern-
ment hacked into the campaign organi-
zation of someone running to be Presi-
dent of the United States. Senior offi-
cials from the 2008 Obama and McCain
presidential campaigns have publicly
confirmed that both organizations were
compromised by hackers. In an inter-
view with NBC News 2013, Dennis Blair,
who served as President Obama’s Di-
rector of National Intelligence between
2009 and 2010 stated that ‘‘Based on ev-
erything I know, this was a case of po-
litical cyber-espionage by the Chinese
government against the two American
political parties. They were looking for
positions on China, surprises that
might be rolled out by campaigns
against China.’’
In recent years, the Republican Na-
tional Committee, the National Repub-
lican Senatorial Committee, and the
the National Republican Congressional
Committee have all been hacked, as
well as the campaigns of Senators GRA-
HAM and MCCAIN. Both major political
parties have suffered hacks, and will
undoubtedly continue to be targeted by
foreign governments and other sophis-
ticated hackers.
Over the past two years, Congress has
turned its attention to several weak-
nesses in our democracy that were ex-
ploited by Russia including the role of
social media companies and long-
standing flaws in paperless voting ma-
chines used in several states. While
these issues have yet to be meaning-
fully addressed, they have, at least,
been the subject of oversight hearings
and legislative proposals in Congress.
In contrast, Congress has yet to hold a
single hearing on the vulnerability of
political parties and campaigns to
hacking by foreign governments, nor
has anyone else in Congress introduced
legislation to help defend these organi-
zations from cyber attacks.
For the sake of the integrity of the
American political process, I introduce
this bill today to protect those running
for office, and the organizations that
support them, from cyber attacks. Rus-
sia’s hacking and leaking of emails in
2016 is now well documented. Their ef-
forts continue. If you think they aren’t
working towards the 2020 federal elec-
tions as hard as any cub reporter in
Iowa, you’d be sadly mistaken. And
they are likely NOT alone. Other hos-
tile governments will undoubtedly seek
to emulate and improve on Russia’s
tactics.
Congress has acted in the past to pro-
tect those running for office from seri-
ous threats. After Senator Robert F.
Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, Con-
gress authorized the Secret Service to
protect Presidential and Vice Presi-
dential candidates. In extending Secret
Service protection to candidates, Con-
gress recognized that the threats to
Presidential and Vice Presidential can-
didates required professional protec-
tion. Congress must now take action to
protect candidates for Federal office—
and consequently, our democracy—
from another serious threat: hacking
by foreign governments.
The political parties are best of the
available options to provide cybersecu-
rity to campaigns. Politicians are al-
ready dependent upon the parties for
fundraising, advertising, polling, mes-
saging, and other forms of support.
Giving parties the responsibility to
provide cybersecurity does not make
politicians dependent on help from a
new entity. Parties are also responsible
to politicians they protect, moreso at
least than any other government, cor-
porate, or non-profit entity.
Quite simply, this bill gives the na-
tional campaign committees the role of
the ‘‘IT Department’’ for state parties,
campaigns, and candidates. The com-
mittees will be able to provide these
entities with securely configured
laptops and cellphones, professionally
administered email, encrypted mes-
saging, and collaboration software, and
if necessary, hire third-party cyberse-
curity experts to help in the event of a
successful hack.
This bill also permits the national
parties to provide this assistance with
money they raise in their ‘‘building
fund.’’ The building fund is one of three
supplementary accounts through which
Congress permitted the national cam-
paign committees to raise an addi-
tional $100,000 per individual, per year,
to pay for the cost of presidential
nominating conventions, national
party headquarters buildings, and elec-
tion recounts and other legal battles.
I know that some advocates have se-
rious concerns about the building fund
and the other supplementary accounts
created by Congress in 2014. I share
these concerns, and have long sup-
ported bold reforms of our campaign fi-
nance system. However, the current
Senate is extremely unlikely to pass
legislation creating public financing of
elections anytime soon, and so while
we have the current system, permit-
ting the use of money in the building
fund for cybersecurity appears to be
the least bad option. Most importantly,
this approach does not permit the par-
ties to raise any new funds—it merely
permits a new use of money raised
through the building fund.
I am not the only one to recognize
the severity of the cyber threat aimed
at political parties. Earlier this year,
the Canadian agency responsible for
government cybersecurity, the Com-
munications Security Establishment,
issued a lengthy report on threats to
elections, which noted that that ‘‘Glob-
ally, political parties, candidates, and
their staff remain attractive targets
for cyber threat activity.’’ Likewise,
the Maryland Board of Elections pub-
lished guidance last week, recognizing

that ‘‘Campaigns are a potential cyber
target,’’ and consequently permitted
state political parties to provide addi-
tional cybersecurity assistance to cam-
paigns.
November 2020 gets closer by the day.
Congress cannot wait any longer to
protect state parties, campaigns, and
the candidates themselves from sophis-
ticated cyber attacks. Accordingly, I
urge my colleagues to promptly act on
this legislation, and to secure our de-
mocracy from cyber threats before it is
too late.

AND POLITICAL FREEDOMS IN
CUBA, AND FOR OTHER PUR-
POSES
Mr. BRAUN (for himself, Mr. COTTON,
Mr. RUBIO, and Mr. CRUZ) submitted
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations:
S. RES. 215
Whereas the Castro regime has used arbi-
trary incarcerations, harassment, and in-
timidation to deny basic freedoms to thou-
sands of Cubans since the Cuban Revolution;
Whereas, in April 2019, a family was sent to
prison by authorities in Cuba for
homeschooling their children;
Whereas the children were enrolled in a
Christian distance school in Honduras;
Whereas the families involved, which in-
cluded a pastor, cited religious reasons for
homeschooling their children;
Whereas the Government of Cuba has a his-
tory of arresting individuals who chose to
homeschool their children and sentencing
them to prison time and hard labor;
Whereas the Government of Cuba’s insist-
ence on state-controlled education is a sign
of authoritarianism, enabling them to indoc-
trinate youth with a communist ideology;
Whereas parents have the right to teach
their children free from the state indoctrina-
tion of an autocratic regime;
Whereas the United States Commission on
International Religious Freedom formerly
condemned Cuba for actions pertaining to
the April 2019 imprisonment of those who
homeschool their children;
Whereas the United States has instituted
an embargo on Cuba in 1960;
Whereas the Cuban Liberty and Demo-
cratic Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996 (22
U.S.C. 6021 et seq.) does not permit these
sanctions to be lifted until the Castro regime
has been deposed and Cuba has legalized po-
litical activity and made a commitment to
free and fair elections; and
Whereas, despite the 2014 Executive branch
decision to normalize relations with Cuba, it
is still in the power of Congress to lift an
embargo: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) expresses solidarity with the people of
Cuba in their pursuit of religious freedom;
(2) calls on the Government of Cuba to re-
lease all political prisoners, including those
who have been imprisoned for homeschooling
their children;
(3) calls on the OAS Inter-American Com-
mission on Human Rights to grant the Pre-
cautionary Measures requested on April 25,
2019;
(4) calls on the Government of Cuba to rec-
ognize the right of parents to teach their
own children free from state communist in-
doctrination;
(5) calls on the Government of Cuba to in-
stitute democratic reforms, including re-
forms that guarantee freedom of religion;
and
(6) calls for the continued implementation
of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Soli-
darity Act of 1996.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3012 May 21, 2019
S. CON. RES. 18
Whereas Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) up-
holds the constitutional right to privacy, in-
cluding in health care decisions and the
right to access abortion care;
Whereas Roe v. Wade demonstrates quality
legal reasoning and is consistent with re-
lated precedent since it was based on sound
legal principles first established in Griswold
v. Connecticut (1965) and Eisenstadt v. Baird
(1972), and repeatedly reaffirmed by the Su-
preme Court, including in Obergefell v.
Hodges (2015);
Whereas the facts that have developed
since Roe v. Wade was decided reaffirm that
people of the United States support the right
to choose, that abortion is a medically safe
procedure, and that access to reproductive
health care provides women with greater
economic opportunities;
Whereas the rights established in Roe v.
Wade have been relied upon in this country
for almost 50 years;
Whereas a majority of people of the United
States support access to abortion care;
Whereas, while the State of Alabama, the
State of Georgia, and other States passed
laws in 2019 that clearly seek to overturn
Roe v. Wade and are unconstitutional; mean-
while in 2018 there were over 60 bills intro-
duced in more than 21 States to protect and
expand access to reproductive care;
Whereas low-income individuals and
women of color are disproportionally im-
pacted by restricting access to abortion care;
and
Whereas when States have enacted laws in
violation of Roe v. Wade, health clinics close
and health care services disappear: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress sup-
ports efforts to—
(1) ensure that all women can access com-
prehensive, unbiased information and make
their own health care decisions;
(2) promote preventive health care services
for women;
(3) ensure that all women have access to
comprehensive, affordable health care that
includes pregnancy-related care, including
prenatal care, miscarriage management,
family planning services, abortion care,
labor and delivery services, and postnatal
care; and
(4) improve women’s access to reproductive
health care, regardless of the State in which
they reside.

The Senator from Ohio.
f
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this
month I join Senator GRASSLEY of Iowa
and a bipartisan group of my col-
leagues to recognize May as National
Foster Care Month.
It is an opportunity to acknowledge
the millions of foster parents and chil-
dren in foster care around the country.
More importantly, it is a call to action.
We simply leave too many children be-
hind.
Poverty should never be the reason
children are separated from their par-
ents. There is no dignity in removing
children from their mothers or fathers
because they don’t have adequate hous-
ing or affordable childcare or jobs that
allow them to take time off when their
children get sick.
Right now, child welfare agencies are
overwhelmed by the number of children
who enter the system, and the addic-
tion crisis just makes it worse. In Ohio,
parents’ substance abuse is listed as
one of the causes for one-third of all
children who enter the system. Chil-
dren who are already in the system
stay there longer, especially teenagers.
We have to do better than that.
Last year, we passed and the Presi-
dent signed the bipartisan Family
First Prevention Services Act, which is
an important first step. It has the po-
tential to change our child welfare sys-
tem over time. Yet the changes the
Family First Prevention Services Act
requires ultimately have to be made at
the State level. We have to make sure
that States have the support they need
and that they actually do what the law
requires.
That is why, this month, I introduced
the Family First Transition and Sup-
port Act—to help all States transition
to the family first era. It would provide
funding for States to recruit and retain
quality foster parents who meet the
needs of children. Our bill would ex-
pand funding for kinship support serv-
ices, which would help family members
who raise children pay for essential
needs and services, like childcare,
transportation, and other things.
This is especially important with the
rise in having other family members
raise the children because of the addic-
tion crisis. In Ohio, Arizona, and all
over this country, we have seen a big
increase in there being grandparents
who raise grandchildren, in large part,
because the children’s parents have had
addiction issues or have actually died
of overdoses.
The grandparents with the grand-
children face unique challenges and
don’t often qualify for the same sup-
port as foster parents. It means that
they are going back to work. It may
mean that a 68-year-old grandmother
who lives on a pension and thought she
was retired has to go back to work in
order to raise this child to make
enough money or has to take money
out of her retirement savings.
Relatives’ care is vital to keeping
kids safe at home and in their commu-
nities. Our bill would provide real fund-
ing to get these grandparents and other
family members more support. There is
no formula here, but most of the time,
it is better if grandparents can raise
these children rather than send them
to foster parents, who are strangers.
The grandparents, obviously, know and
love the children. It doesn’t mean fos-
ter parents can’t, of course, but so
often the grandparents are financially
challenged.
I get letters all the time from Ohio-
ans who tell their stories and ask us to
support these family members.
A man from Richland County, where
I grew up, wrote to me saying:
I ask that family members be given the
same financial aid as foster parents. Most of
the family members are grandparents or
great-grandparents on fixed income with lit-
tle or no money.
Another woman from the county just
south, Knox County, south of Mansfield
wrote:
I am a grandmother raising my grandson.
He is 15 years old, a great kid, and has been
living with me almost all his life. I lost my
beautiful daughter to an overdose.
She was raised in a good home, but was af-
fected by this disease for the past 9 years. We
loved her and miss her every day.
This letter goes on:
Grandparents that lovingly accept their
grandchildren, under sometimes awful [con-
ditions]—
Just think of that. She is raising a
grandson when her daughter died of an
overdose.
Grandparents that lovingly accept their
grandchildren, under sometimes awful cir-
cumstances, often don’t know what to do.
Thank you so much for getting this pro-
gram and money to support it on board.
Grandparents do so much, without much
help.
Last year we were able to break
through the partisanship and get the
Family First Act signed into law. This
bill is the commonsense next step.
This Foster Care Month, I hope that
my colleagues will live up to their
talking points about supporting chil-
dren and families. We hear every day
here how much we support children and
families. Well, do something about it.
Work with us to pass this bill.
I yield the floor.

STRONGER CHILD ABUSE PREVEN-
TION AND TREATMENT ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, May 20, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as
the founding Chair of the Congressional Chil-
dren’s Caucus and a senior member of the
Committee on the Judiciary, I rise today in
strong support of H.R. 2480, the ‘‘Stronger
Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.’’
I support H.R. 2480 because this legislation
will help states to address the recent rise in
child abuse and neglect by providing strategic
funding to build networks of prevention serv-
ices designed to strengthen families and to im-
prove the quality of child protective services.
Madam Speaker, child abuse and neglect is
a pervasive public health problem that con-
tinues to affect millions of children across the
country.
Although we witnessed significant declines
in the rate of child abuse and neglect across
the 1990s and 2000s, the rate of child mal-
treatment has ticked up in recent years as the
opioid epidemic has devastated families and
communities across the country.
In 2017, more children received an inves-
tigation or response from child protective serv-
ices agencies than any other time in the dec-
ade prior.
It is long past time for the federal govern-
ment to provide the necessary funding to re-
verse the rise in child maltreatment.
The ‘‘Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and
Treatment Act’’ authorizes $270 million for the
expansion of prevention services to reach over
3 million children annually and another $270
million to foster new research and support
state child protective services agencies to ex-
pand services to meet increased demand with-
out sacrificing quality.
Madam Speaker, another reason I strongly
support this legislation is that it will also help
address child abuse and neglect by improving
the quality of federal and state data.
Specifically, the ‘‘Stronger Child Abuse Pre-
vention and Treatment Act’’ establishes uni-
form standards for counting child fatalities and
near fatalities related to child maltreatment
and will create an electronic system that al-
lows states to share data from their child
abuse and neglect registries with other states.
H.R. 2480 also combats childhood maltreat-
ment and protects children by initiating pro-
tocol designed to detect infant abuse earlier,
prevent child injuries and fatalities and halting
the effects of maltreatment before they even
develop.
By supporting the training and careers of
medical and child welfare professionals, the
‘‘Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treat-
ment Act’’ will help successfully identify and
respond to signs of potential abuse in infants
under age three, better protecting them from
the immediate and lifelong negative impacts of
childhood maltreatment and offering an en-
sured solution to end abuse.
Madam Speaker, it is unconscionable that 1
in 7 children in the United States suffers from
child abuse or neglect.
The effects of this abuse are far-reaching
and severe, hindering a child’s mental, phys-
ical, and emotional development with con-
sequences that may follow the person through
his or her lifetime.
Childhood maltreatment has also been
linked to higher risk for a wide range of long-
term and future health concerns, including dia-
betes, lung disease, and cancer.
It does not have to be this way, Madam
Speaker, and we can do something about it,
starting with passage of H.R. 2480, the
‘‘Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treat-
ment Act.’’

HONORING OUR NATION’S HEROES
HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to remember the brave men and women
who gave their lives in the defense of freedom
and to preserve the liberties that we hold dear
in this nation.
Every Memorial Day, our nation unites to re-
member our military heroes who have paid the
ultimate sacrifice to defend the values and
freedoms we all cherish. This day of remem-
brance represents why so many people in our
country are grateful to be Americans. No other
nation has sacrificed so much to secure not
only its own freedom, but that of other nations
as well.
As we reflect on the remarkable lives of our
nation’s fallen soldiers and their families, we
must continue to honor them each and every
day, as a single day of commemoration is far
short of what they deserve. I know that back
home in my district, our community will do
their part in carrying on the legacy of these
selfless individuals.
This year, the Granbury community will host
their annual ‘‘Field of Flags,’’ which is a me-
morial of over a thousand flags flying along
Highway 377. These flags are dedicated to the
lives of those that were killed in action or that
are still missing in action.
Attending Memorial Day events like the
‘‘Field of Flags’’ this weekend is imperative to
teaching younger generations about the sac-
rifices that our military and first-responders
make so that we may continue to live by the
values that founded this nation.
May God bless our men and women serving
today and in days past, may He comfort those
who endure the pain of loss, and may He
never cease to shed his grace on Texas and
this great nation.
CONGRATULATING GIRL SCOUT
GOLD AWARD RECIPIENTS
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in
congratulating several extraordinary young
women from Missouri’s Third Congressional
District, for their achievement in earning the
prestigious Girl Scout Gold Award.
The Girl Scout Gold Award is not an
achievement easily obtained. It requires a sig-
nificant amount of time, initiative, commitment,
and leadership. The lessons learned in each
of the seven steps that must be completed to
achieve the Gold Award can be used beyond
the Girl Scouts and applied in their edu-
cational choices, career paths, and everyday
lives. With each of their Gold Projects, the
young women have identified issues in their
communities important to them, created plans
for solving these concerns, and tackled the
problems head-on. Because of their deter-
mination and drive, they have helped make
their community a better place. Each of these
young ladies should be proud of their accom-
plishments and I am honored to recognize
each of them on this momentous occasion.
Congratulations to the following outstanding
young women: Allison Bright, Emily Kurtz,
Lindsay Picha, Kimberly Coulon, Maddi
McGuire, Jillian Marie Rodgers, Madelynn
Dickson, Anne Katherine Meister, Victoria
Suerig, Nicolette Kolenc, Alyssa Miller, Madi-
son Stumpf, Josephine Schmaltz, Sarah
Burke, Shannon Wyss, and Sarah Wyble for
their hard work and dedication as they join a
selective group of young women.
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing these exceptional young women for a
job well done.

RECOGNIZING NOAH CONNER
HON. MIKE BOST
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Noah Conner in honor of his pres-
entation of the Golden Apple Award. Out of
150,000 high schoolers, this distinction is
given to 26 students across the state of Illinois
who not only exhibit an exceptional work ethic
within the classroom, but in athletics as well.
As a senior at Pinckneyville High School,
Conner has shown his excellence in track and
cross-country running while maintaining a per-
fect 4.0 Grade Point Average. This balance of
academics and athletics is a difficult task, and
I can’t think of a more fitting individual to be
merited this tremendous award.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
Noah Conner and commend him for his hard
work in and out of the classroom.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF
KATHLEEN PIERCE-RYAN
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, today I rise
to honor the life and legacy of my constituent
Kathleen Pierce-Ryan, who as an active mem-
ber of her community, passionate about giving
back through her gift of song.
Kathleen Pierce-Ryan was born on April 7,
1931, to Irish immigrants in the Bronx. Her tal-
ent for singing became evident early in life,
and she developed her voice with her music
teacher Sister Gabriel at St. Gabriel’s Parish
School. Going on to win local singing competi-
tions and receive awards for her perform-
ances, Kathleen auditioned at the Metropolitan
Opera where she was awarded a scholarship
and even performed at a concert in Manhattan
Town Hall.
It was her brother who invited Kathleen to
perform at the inaugural ceremony at Calver-
ton National Cemetery, and she volunteered
there, singing the National Anthem and God
Bless America every Memorial Day and Vet-
erans Day ceremony, for the next 39 years.
Having had the honor of attending many of
these services, I can attest that her songs
touched the hearts of everyone who had the
pleasure of listening and provided solace to
those who grieved.
It was during some of the hardest moments
in the lives of these veteran families that
Kathleen’s voice comforted them, her patriotic
melodies evoking an everlasting sense of
pride. There is no doubt her passing pains the
hearts of each and every family she touched
throughout her 39 years singing at Calverton.
Her voice is now sorely missed across Calver-
ton National Cemetery and our entire commu-
nity.
This Memorial Day, as we honor the service
and sacrifice of the brave men and women
who have fought for the freedoms and liberties
that make this country the greatest in the
world and the families that have stood by their
side, let us also remember the so many Amer-
icans like Kathleen who have done their part
to serve and inspire throughout our great na-
tion.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF BETTY
LIGGINS
HON. RAÚL M. GRIJALVA
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Ms. Betty Liggins, a nurse and
community civil rights activist, whose work
tackling rampant crime and drugs in her neigh-
borhood helped create a safe environment for
families to thrive and grow.
Although she lost her final battle on May 8,
2019, her legacy as a nurse working out of
her mobile health clinic and helping those in
need lives on. Ms. Liggins’ service was in-
spired by a chance meeting with Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. at a civil rights march in Chi-
cago, where Dr. King encouraged her to go
back to school, finish her education, and help
others. Inspired by his words, she attended
the University of Arizona where she received
her degree and became a Licensed Practical
Nurse (LPN) and vowed to use her talents to
champion the causes of the voiceless.
Ms. Liggins received many awards for her
service to our community. She received the
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ‘‘Drum Major
Award’’ and the National Jefferson Award in
1993 which was awarded in our nation’s cap-
ital. Her activism and leadership helped lift our
community beyond what we could ever imag-
ine, and she was recognized as one of the 25
Most Influential African Americans in Southern
Arizona.
Ms. Liggins also took pride in her political
activism and worked tirelessly to register vot-
ers and use the ballot box for change. An ac-
tive member of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),
she continually advocated for criminal justice
reform to give incarcerated young African
Americans a chance at a better life. Bearing
witness to the blatant racism and prejudice of
her youth endowed her with the grit and deter-
mination to ensure that that mistakes and trau-
ma of the past were not inflicted on future
generations.
In that vein, she took on the education sys-
tem and advocated for better policies to im-
prove the graduation rates of African American
students. Instead of being discouraged by a
justice system that sometimes turned a critical
eye to the poor, and a health system that put
corporate interests over the health of her com-
munity, she remained motivated to create
positive change.
Betty Liggins didn’t hold back. Her life is an
example of how ordinary citizens with ordinary
means can always stand up against the evils
of injustice and poverty and accomplish ex-
traordinary things.

IN SUPPORT OF THE 2020 CENSUS
HON. RICK LARSEN
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of the 2020 Census.
Every decade, the Census shapes important
local infrastructure and investment decisions
like where to build new schools, establish
workforce training sites, invest in road and
public transportation projects, and fund health
care and affordable housing. The Census also
determines how many Members of Congress
are allocated per state and informs decisions
about Congressional district lines, ensuring fair
representation.
An accurate Census is vital to the well-being
of Washington’s communities. That is why I
oppose adding a citizenship question to the
Census. By enabling informed decisions, ac-
curate Census data can create jobs, stimulate
economic growth and increase employment
opportunities for people in Washington’s Sec-
ond District. Adding an un-tested citizenship
question will sow fear and lead people to not
respond to the Census survey, negatively im-
pacting local communities.
Madam Speaker, I continue to support a
well-researched and just 2020 Census to fos-
ter innovation, growth and prosperity for
Washington state communities.

CONGRATULATING THE BRADLEY
UNIVERSITY SPEECH TEAM ON
THEIR WIN AT THE AMERICAN
FORENSICS ASSOCIATION’S NA-

HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Bradley University Speech
Team on their victories at the American
Forensics Association and National Forensic
Association national tournaments. Bradley Uni-
versity is the only team to win a national
championship every decade since 1980 and is
one of the most winning teams in the country.
Bradley’s Speech Team is an extremely ac-
complished program and impressively have
now added two more national titles to their
long list of championships. The program has
also claimed more than 150 individual national
champions and has served as a special place
on campus for students to come together, tell
stories and improve their communication skills
along the way. The speech community unites
students across the country and provides
them with a community to share their passions
and discuss topics important to them. I under-
stand the amount of hard work and commit-
ment to have a team as special as this. They
are an example of how a strong work ethic
and dedication can lead to victory. I am proud
there is such young talent in our community,
and to see them represent Peoria throughout
the state and country. I look forward to fol-
lowing them as they continue their work and
build skills that will last a lifetime.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
the Bradley University Speech Team that I am
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would
like to again formally congratulate the Bradley
University Speech Team on their victories at
the American Forensics Association and Na-
tional Forensic Association national tour-
naments.

NEW FETAL HEARTBEAT
ABORTION LAWS
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
to express my strong opposition to the so-
called ‘‘fetal heartbeat’’ laws recently enacted
in Georgia, Alabama, Missouri, Texas, and
other states.
GEORGIA
House Bill 481 outlaws abortion after six
weeks of pregnancy, when a doctor can usu-
ally detect a fetus’ heartbeat. Gov. Brian
Kemp signed it into law May 7, and it is set
to go into effect Jan. 1—unless it is blocked
by the courts.
MISSOURI
The Missouri House passed H.B. 126 in a
110-to-44 vote after hours of heated debate,
including impassioned speeches by both
Democratic and Republican legislators and
angry shouts of ‘‘when you lie, people die’’
from those who opposed the bill. Those pro-
testers were eventually removed by the po-
lice.
The measure, known as the Missouri
Stands for the Unborn Act, now moves to the
desk of Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, who
is expected to sign it. The bill, which bans
abortions at around eight weeks of preg-
nancy, often before a woman even knows she
is pregnant, included no exceptions for rape
or incest.
ALABAMA
Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama on Wednesday
signed into law a bill banning almost all
abortions in the state, with no exceptions for
cases of rape or incest. Under the law, which
is scheduled to take effect in six months, an
abortion is only legal if the pregnant per-
son’s life is at risk. A doctor who performs
an abortion for any other reason could face
up to 99 years in prison.
TEXAS
The Texas Senate approved a bill Thursday
that would impose criminal penalties on doc-
tors who fail to treat babies born alive after
failed abortion attempts—extremely rare
cases—a month after the House approved the
same measure. If the House concurs with the
Senate’s minor changes to House Bill 16, it
will then head to the governor’s desk.
The Senate approved the bill in a 21–10
vote, with Democratic state senators Eddie
Lucio of Brownsville and Judith Zaffirini of
Laredo bucking their party to support the
measure. The measure, authored by state
Rep. Jeff Leach, R–Plano, gives teeth to ex-
isting federal and state laws that grant legal
protections to children born after abortion
attempts. Doctors who ‘‘fail to provide the
appropriate medical treatnent’’—like imme-
diately transferring the infant to a hos-
pital—could be charged with a third-degree
felony, and they would have to pay a fine of
at least $100,000.
MISSISSIPPI
Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed the
bill into law in March which says physicians
who perform abortions after a fetal heart-
beat is found (typically at around 6 weeks)
could have their medical licenses revoked.
The state allows abortions after a fetal
heartbeat is found if a pregnancy endangers
a woman’s life or one of her major bodily
functions but does not have exceptions for
cases of rape or incest.
OHIO
Gov. Mike DeWine signed one of the na-
tion’s most restrictive abortion bans into
law Thursday afternoon and opponents have
already pledged to take him to court. The
American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio has
already promised to sue over the legislation,
which would ban abortions after a fetal
heartbeat is detected and prosecute doctors
who perform them anyway. A fetal heartbeat
can be detected as early as six weeks into a
woman’s pregnancy, which can be before a
woman finds out she’s pregnant. The ‘‘heart-
beat bill’’ passed the GOP-controlled Legis-
lature on Wednesday amid protests from ad-
vocates of abortion access. DeWine signed
the bill, making Ohio the sixth state to
enact the ban. Under the bill, doctors would
face a fifth-degree felony punishable by up to
a year in prison for performing an abortion
after detecting a heartbeat. The bill has an
exception to save the life of the woman but
no exception for rape or incest—in line with
current state law.

OF SCHOOLS THOMAS
HOEGERMAN RETIRES
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the retirement of Superintendent
Thomas E. Hoegerman, who will retire from
Apple Valley Unified School District on May
22, 2019.
Thomas E. Hoegerman was born Sep-
tember 15, 1959 in Lodi, CA. He attended
California State University Sacramento where
he earned a B.A. in liberal studies, which he
later followed with a teaching credential from
the University of the Pacific and a master’s
degree from Chapman University. He joined
the Apple Valley Unified School District in
1989, where he taught at Yucca Loma Ele-
mentary School and later at Vista Campana
Middle School. In 1996, Tom joined the Dis-
trict Office, where he has worked to improve
education outcomes across the district.
During his time at the District Office, Tom
oversaw the construction of both Granite Hills
High School and Sitting Bull Academy. He
also implemented class-size reduction, as-
sessment systems, and data analysis pro-
grams across the district. His leadership dur-
ing the restructuring that followed the Great
Recession was instrumental in ensuring stu-
dent success while keeping the district finan-
cially stable. Tom has also served in several
educational organizations, including the San
Bernardino County District Advocates for Bet-
ter Students, California Association of Health
and Education Linked Professions, and San
Bernardino Gangs and Drugs Task Force Ex-
ecutive Committee.
Superintendent Thomas Hoegerman has
been an incredible asset to the education
community in Apple Valley, and he will be
sorely missed in retirement. I wish him and his
wife Lisa a happy retirement and a happy 30th
anniversary this July.

IN HONOR OF THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT
HON. DUNCAN HUNTER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
commemorate the 100th anniversary of the
House passage of the 19th Amendment,
which guaranteed women the right to vote.
The Senate followed the House two weeks
later with passage on June 4, 1919, and the
amendment was ratified by the states the fol-
lowing year. This historic centennial offers an
unparalleled opportunity to commemorate this
victorious milestone of the women’s suffrage
movement.
In 1848, a group of women organized a na-
tional women’s rights convention in Seneca
Falls, New York. Following the convention, the
right to vote came to the front and center of
the women’s rights movement. Many women
like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott,
along with Susan B. Anthony and other activ-
ists, raised public awareness and lobbied state
and federal governments to grant voting rights
to women.
Almost 70 years later, in her first term,
Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to
Congress, introduced a Constitutional Amend-
ment to grant women’s suffrage. Several years
later, women’s rights groups finally emerged
victorious with the passage of the 19th
Amendment.
Madam Speaker, our democracy is stronger
because of the 19th Amendment, and I am
proud to honor women like Elizabeth Cady
Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Susan B. Anthony and
other women, who accomplished so much.
The efforts of these great American women af-
ford generations to come with the opportunity
to vote freely, whether it is in a neighbor’s ga-
rage in Escondido, or from a far battlefield de-
fending our freedom.

great Floridian, Sandy D’Alemberte. As it does
for so many, his passing pains me both per-
sonally and for our state and country. Sandy
was a voice for reason, the rule of law, de-
cency and kindness—a ‘‘necessary man’’ for
all his time and certainly for these times. It is
enough to remember him as a brilliant legis-
lator, president of the American Bar Associa-
tion (ABA), Florida State University (FSU)
president and Florida Constitutional scholar.
And, much loved dean while I was at FSU
College of Law. However, Sandy was indis-
pensable in so many instances in Florida’s
history—both the big moments and some mo-
ments that most of his fellow Floridians might
never know about but which were just as
grand. One of the latter was his embrace of
Jose Manuel Godinez-Samperio and his fight
to be admitted to the Florida Bar. Jose grad-
uated valedictorian of his class at Armwood
High School in Hillsborough County, Fla. and
went on to attend FSU College of Law. Jose
made history when he graduated from FSU
College of Law and passed the Florida Bar
exam, but when he sought admittance to the
Florida Bar as an undocumented immigrant,
this great American Story almost came to an
end. Sandy’s belief in the law, fair play and
young people caused him to take on this injus-
tice. He brought together a team, including
me, past presidents of the ABA, bipartisan
members of the Florida Legislature and oth-
ers, to successfully confront this quiet indi-
vidual inequity just as he had taken on more
large and public challenges for all of Florida.
Like so many public officials, I can say that
Sandy has helped make me a better rep-
resentative for my neighbors in Tampa and
throughout Florida. I sought his counsel for
Florida’s future as recently as last fall. The
gracious efforts by Sandy on behalf of the
small and the grand, and the foundation he
has laid for the legal community, higher edu-
cation, his state and his country will hopefully
be of some solace to Patsy and his family.

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma or
DIPG is a common form of pediatric brain can-
cer responsible for the majority of deaths in
children with brain tumors annually. In honor
of Olivia Mazzell, whose life was taken far too
soon by DIPG, I am grateful to cosponsor
House Resolution 114, which supports the
designation of May 17th as ‘DIPG Awareness
Day’ to raise awareness and encourage re-
search into cures for DIPG and pediatric can-
cers in general.
I would also like to recognize her grand-
parents Angelo and Kathy Basile and parents
Jonathan Mazzell and Heather Hiett of Lex-
ington, South Carolina, for their efforts to cre-
ate greater access to helpful medications.
Working together we can have a meaningful
conversation about strengthening medical re-
search to address the needs of children with
cancer.

INTRODUCTION OF THE REBUILD
AMERICA ACT OF 2019
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today
I introduced the Rebuild America Act of 2019.
This legislation makes much-needed invest-
ments in America’s roads, bridges, and transit
systems by raising the federal gasoline excise
tax by five cents a year for the next five years,
indexing it to inflation, and expressing Con-
gress’ intention to repeal and replace the gas
tax with a more sustainable funding source.
The United States faces the largest infra-
structure funding gap in the world. The sector
with the greatest shortfall is surface transpor-
tation, which the American Society of Civil En-
gineers estimates needs more than $1.1 tril-
lion of investment by 2025. Worse, we are
paying for 2019 infrastructure with 1993 dol-
lars. Inflation and fuel efficiency improvements
have reduced the gas tax’s purchasing power
by more than 40 percent since it was last
raised in 1993.
Today, one in five miles of highway pave-
ment is in poor condition, and damage due to
rough roads costs the average motorist $599
a year. Americans waste nearly 100 hours a
year stuck in traffic and congestion, costing
the U.S. economy $305 billion annually—an
average of $1,445 per driver. These costs fall
especially hard on low-income individuals, who
can’t afford the unexpected burden of a blown
tire, hourly wages lost to congestion, or the
steadily increasing cost of transportation.
Since 2010, 35 states with legislatures con-
trolled by both parties have voted to raise the
gas tax. American families pay far more from
continued neglect than a gas tax increase. In-
action will cost families $3,400 in annual dis-
posable income by 2025, whereas a 25-cent
gas tax increase costs the average driver less
than $3.00 a week and contributes nearly
$400 billion toward upgrading roads, bridges,
and transit systems. Investment in American
infrastructure is the jobs bill that our economy
needs and the middle class deserves. Every
$1.3 billion in infrastructure investment adds
29,000 construction jobs, yields $2 billion in
economic growth, and reduces the federal def-
icit by $200 million.
This legislation is expected to invest nearly
$400 billion in the next decade for surface
transportation projects and deserves inclusion
in a comprehensive infrastructure package
that rebuilds and renews America.

May 21, 2019
Wishnick—a beloved husband, and Los Ange-
les community leader—who passed away on
April 27, 2019 at the age of 76.
Arnie was born on September 7, 1942 in
Chicago, Illinois to Ruth and Ben Wishnick,
who immigrated to the United States from Po-
land. His career began in high school as a re-
pairman for the Schick Razor Company. After
college, he moved out west to join the emerg-
ing banking industry in Beverly Hills, eventu-
ally settling in Pacific Palisades.
In 1993, Arnie assumed the role of execu-
tive director of Pacific Palisades Chamber of
Commerce, a position he held for 25 years.
During those years, his extraordinary love and
commitment to the community was evident
from his dedicated organization of annual
events like the Palisades Teen Contest, the
Classic Auto Show and the Holiday Ho Ho Ho.
Arnie especially enjoyed coordinating celeb-
rity appearances each year for the Fourth of
July Palisades Americanism Parade. He also
convinced stars such as Billy Crystal, Martin
Short, and Steve Guttenberg to be Honorary
Mayors of Pacific Palisades.
He was deeply involved in every aspect of
the community. He was president of the Opti-
mist Club of Pacific Palisades and an active
member of both the Village Green Committee
and PRIDE, two organizations designed to im-
prove and enhance the aesthetics of Pacific
Palisades. He was an honorary Rotarian and
was recognized time and again for his service
to the community, including with the Citizen of
the Year, Sparkplug, and Pride of the Pali-
sades awards.
Arnie loved the arts—he produced four
musicals at Theatre Palisades and was a
member of the Just Off Via Dance Troupe that
performed at various community events. For a
time, he even wrote movie reviews for the
local newspaper.
Arnie is survived by his wife, Jackie; step
children, Wendy and Daniel; their child, Bella;
and his sister, Audrey. Arnie was always smil-
ing, eager to chat and willing to help in any
way he could. May Arnie’s memory be a
blessing to us all.

Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the retirement Chief Warrant Officer
James R. Curry, who will be retiring after 30
years of active duty in the United States Navy.
Chief Warrant Officer Curry joined the Navy
on August 28, 1989 as an Airman Recruit and
completed Basic Recruit Training at Great
Lakes, Illinois. His first assignment for as
Naval Air Station North Island, where he
served as a Plane Captain for Helicopter Anti-
Submarine Squadron Ten. Over the course of
his career, Chief Warrant Officer Curry has
served in support of numerous operations, in-
cluding North Korean Contingency Operations,
Operation Desert Strike, Operation Southern
Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom. Following multiple de-
ployments afloat with Helicopter Anti-Sub-
marine Squadron Four and Helicopter Anti-
Submarine Squadron Six, Chief Warrant Offi-
cer Curry reported to NAVSUPPFAC at
Paxtuent River, Maryland, where he served as

STROKE AWARENESS MONTH
HON. JOYCE BEATTY
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize May as Stroke Awareness Month.
Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death and
affects someone every 40 seconds in the U.S.
As a stroke survivor, I know the difficult road
to recovery.
That’s why I’ve reintroduced the Return to
Work Awareness Act to help survivors of
stroke and other serious illnesses get back
into the workforce.
I invite my colleagues to join in cospon-
soring the Return to Work Awareness Act, as
well as my resolution recognizing Stroke
Awareness Month.
But, we can do a lot more than just raise
awareness, and I’m proud to say that House
Democrats are delivering ‘‘For the People.’’
In the past few weeks, we passed a bill pro-
tecting health coverage for the 130 million
Americans living with pre-existing conditions,
including 6.5 million stroke survivors, and
today we will debate legislation to strengthen
the Affordable Care Act and lower drug costs.
Madam Speaker, let’s continue delivering
‘‘For the People’’ in May and every other
month.
THE SECOND STAGE OF AOG
HISTORY (1901–45)
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
clude in the RECORD part two of an article I
submitted earlier this year by Keith J. Hamel
honoring the 150th Anniversary of the West
Point Association of Graduates:
‘‘At the turn of the 20th century, the Asso-
ciation of Graduates of the United States
Military Academy had been in existence for
more than three decades. It began on May 22,
1869, when 15 graduates, acting upon an idea
from Robert Anderson, Class of 1825, met in
the office of Dr. Horace Webster, Class of
1818, and adopted articles and bylaws for the
new organization. Article II of the Associa-
tion’s Constitution stated: ‘‘The object of
this Association shall be to cherish the
memories of the Military Academy at West
Point, and to promote the social intercourse
and fraternal fellowship of its graduates.’’
According to Charles P. Echols, Class of 1891,
the early years of the Association were dedi-
cated to ‘‘little more than holding an annual
meeting at West Point, collecting dues, and
publishing an annual bulletin.’’ Echols was
generalizing, of course—in its early years,
the Association moved Sylvanus Thayer’s re-
mains to the West Point Cemetery and me-
morialized him with a statue, and it built a
memorial hall at West Point with funds left
by George Cullum in his will—but in the first
stage of its existence, the Association was
hardly recognizable as the organization it
would later become. That began to change
during the Association of Graduates’ second
stage of evolution (1901–45), as changes to
AOG’s mission, governance, and operations
signaled its desire to become more like a
‘‘modern’’ alumni association.
One year into that second stage, the mem-
bership of the Association was celebrated by
President Theodore Roosevelt, who attended
West Point’s Centennial Exercises and said
during his June 11, 1902 speech, ‘‘During [its
first 100 years] no other educational institu-
tion in the land has contributed so many
names as West Point has contributed to the
honor roll of the nation’s greatest citizens
. . . The average graduate of West Point dur-
ing these hundred years has given a greater
sum of service to the country through his
life than has the average graduate of any
other institution in this broad land.’’ A year
earlier, almost as if in anticipation of Roo-
sevelt’s remarks, the Association’s 1901 An-
nual Reunion included an ‘‘Index to Obitu-
aries (1870–1900),’’ which contained 953 names
of the president’s ‘‘honor roll’’ and informa-
tion on how to find biographies detailing
each’s ‘‘sum of service to the country.’’ Also,
with 1902 being the Centennial of West Point,
some 350 members of the Long Gray Line
were present to personally hear Roosevelt’s
tribute, more than triple the attendance of
the previous highest annual meeting attend-
ance (109 in 1883). During the Centennial Ex-
ercises, they also witnessed Lieutenant Gen-
eral John M. Schofield, Class of 1853 (Re-
tired) and President of the Association,
unveil a tablet commemorating the Acad-
emy’s first century of existence. ‘‘Let us all
pledge ourselves to our country, that the
best efforts of our lives shall be to make the
record of the second century even more
memorable than that of the first,’’ Schofield
said in his brief remarks.
Despite the excitement and vigor inspired
by West Point’s Centennial Exercises, the
Association of Graduates returned to a more

typical level of attendance in 1903, with only
20 graduates attending the annual meeting.
Lack of participation became one of two
main concerns of the Association in the new
century. During the 1905 annual meeting,
Alexander Webb, Class of 1855, proposed a
resolution to form a committee to study the
attendance issue and to offer a solution.
Webb’s classmate Charles Larned was ap-
pointed chairman. He reportedly addressed
the matter at the 1906 meeting, but no
records of his report exist. A few years later,
however, Robert Howze, Class of 1888, who
was a member of Larned’s ‘‘Committee on
Entertainment,’’ suggested that interest
could be added to the annual meeting if the
Superintendent would designate one day dur-
ing the graduating week as ‘‘Graduates’
Day,’’ and that ‘‘some specially interesting
features be added to this day’s exercises.’’
Howze’s idea was enthusiastically received
and unanimously adopted, but it took 15
years before it came to fruition under a new
name.
The second main concern of the Associa-
tion centered on a gift that graduates could
present to the Academy. In 1907, John Car-
son, Class of 1855, suggested that the Asso-
ciation raise funds for an organ for the new
Cadet Chapel, for which the Academy had
just broken ground a year earlier. At the
same annual meeting, a proposal was made
to purchase bronze doors for Thayer Hall
(then the name of the ballroom in Cullum
Hall), but it was rejected given that plans
were already underway to change the room,
making such doors obsolete. The gift matter
went to committee, and the following year
its members recommended a memorial win-
dow for the new Cadet Chapel to be built
over the altar. By 1909, one year before the
Cadet Chapel was completed, the Association
had raised $1,564 for the ‘‘Memorial Window
Fund.’’ Eight glass companies submitted
competitive designs for the project, and on
October 17, 1909 a jury of committee and ad-
visory members settled on two designs,
which went head-to-head in a second com-
petition in February 1910. The contract for
the memorial window, at an amount of
$8,000, was ultimately awarded to the Willett
Stained Glass and Decorating Company of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Soon after, Ber-
tram Goodhue, the architect of the Cadet
Chapel, wrote a letter to the Association
stating, ‘‘I think there is no doubt but that
you will have . . . the most wonderful win-
dow of modern times and one of the finest in
the world.’’ At the conclusion of the 1911 an-
nual meeting, which was held in the new
Cadet Chapel, Horace Porter, Class of 1860,
presented the memorial window to the Acad-
emy on behalf of the living alumni, approxi-
mately 140 of whom were present to see
Major General Thomas Barry, Class of 1877,
the 27th Superintendent of USMA, accept the
Association’s gift.
In addition to noting the increased number
of graduates attending the 42nd annual meet-
ing, the 1911 Annual Reunion was the first to
highlight classes holding their own reunions
at West Point, citing those of 1886, 1891, 1896,
and 1901. Two years later, all five living
members of the Class of 1863 returned to
their Rockbound Highland Home to celebrate
the 50th anniversary of their graduation. Ac-
cording to the 1913 Annual Reunion, ‘‘Every-
thing possible was done to make it pleasant
for the visiting graduates by the Super-
intendent, the Quartermaster and the offi-
cers detailed to meet the trains and have
charge of rooms in Cullum and Cadet Bar-
racks.’’ In a letter submitted to the 1913 Ex-
ecutive Committee, Francis Hills, Class of
1866, went even further, extending his per-
sonal appreciation to Colonel Clarence
Townsley, Class of 1881, the 28th Super-
intendent of USMA, for making all graduates
‘‘feel that they are warmly welcomed to
their old home.’’
In the wake of these warm sentiments,
Gustav Fiebeger, Class of 1879 and a member
of the Executive Committee, announced a
plan at the 1915 annual meeting for classes to
purchase one panel each for the remaining
windows of the new Cadet Chapel. According
to George Pappas, Class of 1944, the next
morning, representatives from the Class of
1875 presented the Association with a check
for $250, making it the first class to place a
window in the Chapel. Within two years,
more than 20 classes sponsored windows.
‘‘The Stained Glass Window’’ project became
the forerunner of Class Giving at the Asso-
ciation of Graduates, with each graduating
class, 1802 through 1976, purchasing a panel
and filling all the available space (windows
in memory of earlier classes were sponsored
by classes graduating 100 years later). The
new Cadet Chapel inspired even more giving:
Arthur Gerhard donated a baptismal font in
memory of his father, William Gerhard,
Class of 1869; and the Class of 1885 initiated
an effort to purchase a full set of chimes on
behalf of the Association. Furthermore, the
enthusiasm for the Academy at this time
could not be contained to just the annual
meeting at West Point. In 1915, more than 100
graduates dined together in Honolulu, Ha-
waii, sending ‘‘felicitations to those gathered
at West Point’’; and, in 1916, graduates held
large dinners in Boston, New York, Chicago,
San Francisco, Honolulu, and Manila to cele-
brate the anniversary of the Academy’s
founding.
Unfortunately, World War I put a halt on
the momentum that had been building for
the Association and Long Gray Line during
this time. There was no annual meeting in
1917, and the next major milestone of AOG
history did not occur until 1922, despite the
Association celebrating its 50th anniversary
in 1919 (although it did present the chimes to
the Cadet Chapel at its annual meeting that
year). At the 1922 meeting, William Dykman,
Class of 1875, who was elected President of
the Association in 1920, introduced several
amendments to AOG’s Constitution. First,
he proposed ‘‘to amplify the statement of the
object of the Association.’’ This amendment
added the phrase ‘‘to promote its [the Mili-
tary Academy at West Point] welfare and
that of its graduates’’ to Article II of the
Constitution, which is the predecessor of the
West Point Association of Graduate’s cur-
rent mission: ‘‘To serve West Point and the
Long Gray Line.’’ Dykman also suggested re-
visions to AOG’s governance: recommending
a Vice President, increasing the Executive
Committee from 10 to 30 members (to be ap-
pointed by the President), and transferring
the appointment of AOG Secretary and
Treasurer from the presiding officer at the
annual meeting to the President. Dykman’s
amendments were universally adopted, put-
ting AOG on the path to developing the
Board of Trustees governing model that
would it later employ throughout the re-
mainder of the century. Dykman’s arguably
finest contribution to the Association oc-
curred two years earlier, although it took
some time to become manifest. In 1920, after
he had been elected President, Dykman
sought to influence members of graduating
classes to join the Association and intro-
duced the idea of associate membership to
AOG. In the 1921 Annual Report, Dykman re-
ported that all 17 members of the Class of
1921 (the ‘‘Orioles’’) became members. The
same was true for the Class of 1922, ‘‘nearly
all as life members,’’ and more than 80 per-
cent of graduates from successive classes
throughout the 1920s joined. According to
Dykman’s obituary in the 1938 Annual Re-
port, ‘‘This infusion of younger members
into the Association of Graduates, for which
he was largely responsible, gave the Associa-
tion new life and new objectives.’’
One of those new objectives was ‘‘Alumni
Day’’ (modeled on ‘‘Graduates’ Day,’’ pro-
posed 15 years earlier), which was first held
on June 11, 1923 and included a wreath-laying
ceremony at Thayer Statue, a tradition that
continues to this day. From 1925 to 1928,
Dykman served as AOG Vice President (the
post he recommended three years prior) and
then as Chairman of the Board of Trustees
until 1935. In 1926, his idea for associate
membership was finally approved, allowing
those who completed initial summer train-
ing and stayed at the Academy long enough
to take their first semester’s exams to join
the AOG. This expansion of membership pro-
vided a temporary spike in the Association’s
revenue (a nearly 45 percent increase in
membership fees and annual dues), but a 1927
report by the Finance Committee (of which
Dykman was a senior member) showed the
need to establish an income stream beyond
dues to support the Association. As a result,
provisions were made for the establishment
of an Endowment Fund, the annual income
from which would provide necessary oper-
ating funds for the Association in per-
petuity.
Statements in the report such as, ‘‘If this
Association is to fulfill its natural and prop-
er mission and give that measure of support
and assistance to the Military Academy
which other Colleges and Universities re-
ceive from their graduates, it must have an
assured income,’’ seem to come straight
from Dykman, who was a respected New
York City lawyer and director of four power-
ful companies of the day. Returning to his
obituary, ‘‘[His] great contribution to the
Military Academy and to the Association of
Graduates was giving to it a re-birth of in-
terest and imbuing its members with a feel-
ing of respect for the power of the Associa-
tion in doing many things for West Point
which the Academy and the War Department
authorities could not well do.’’
During its ‘‘re-birth,’’ the Association of
Graduates gave life to new projects and grew
in its duties. The ‘‘Forward’’ to the 1929 An-
nual Report called attention to some of
these changes. It stated, ‘‘This issue . . . rep-
resents the beginning of an effort upon the
part of your Officers and Trustees to present
it in a somewhat improved and more attrac-
tive form . . . new matter has been intro-
duced, and long lists containing names and
addresses of members have been omitted . . .
the work of the work of the Association is an
event of the first importance, and promises
much towards the increased usefulness of the
Association in the future.’’ The Association
was moving toward what Alexander Piper,
Class of 1889 and AOG President (1934–36),
later called, ‘‘. . . more life and less
morgue.’’ There was even discussion during
this time to ‘‘kill’’ publication of graduates’
obituaries in the annual report, which com-
prised approximately 75 percent of each
issue, but members ultimately felt this
would violate the original mission of the As-
sociation: ‘‘. . . to cherish the memories of
our Alma Mater,’’ particularly through its
graduates.
In 1930, the Association renewed the publi-
cation of the AOG Bulletin, a ‘‘mid-year
pamphlet’’ designed to keep members ‘‘in-
formed of current matters of interest during
the long interval between the publication of
[AOG’s] annual reports.’’ There were four
Bulletins issued between December 1900 and
April 1905, but then publication mysteriously
ceased. One plausible reason is that the ear-
lier Bulletin was published by ‘‘U.S.M.A.
Press, West Point, N.Y.’’ AOG balance sheets
of this period only show expenses for pub-
lishing the annual report, which used

Saginaw, Michigan. AOG was able to revive
the Bulletin thanks to the support it re-
ceived from the June 1929 establishment of
an Association office at the Academy,
manned by an active duty officer who served
‘‘in the capacity of Secretary and Treasurer
of the Association of Graduates and as the
Officer in Charge of Cullum’s Register.’’ AOG
published four Bulletins between 1930 and
1934. As before, the reason why publication
stopped remains a mystery, although its de-
sign seemed to influence the annual report,
which started publishing reunion summaries
in 1935.
The Bulletin reappeared one more time in
1941, brought back to inform ‘‘Association
members of matters of current West Point
interest, particularly since the Military
Academy curriculum, always in step with
the times, so well meets the demands of the
present national emergency.’’ The format of
this last issue had radically changed from its
predecessors. Instead of long treatises re-
garding ‘‘The Indebtedness of the United
States to the Military Academy’’ or ‘‘Arthur
Sherburne Hardy’s Opinion of the West Point
Educational System,’’ Bulletin No. 9 was
written in news sheet style and contained
brief reports about current happenings at the
Academy (e.g., ‘‘First Class Attends Maneu-
vers,’’ ‘‘Branch Instruction,’’ ‘‘Skeet Club,’’
reports from academic departments, etc.). A
year later in 1942, AOG’s Bulletin and the an-
nual report, which had existed for 72 years,
merged to form the first issue of Assembly
magazine, the periodical publication that
would inform graduates for the next 70 years.
Innovations to keep AOG relevant to grad-
uates were not only confined to its commu-
nication efforts. The final part of the Asso-
ciation’s re-birth involved changes to its
governance, which were done to make the or-
ganization more transparent and account-
able to its membership. After accepting
Dykman’s proposed changes in the early
1920s, AOG elected a President and Vice-
President at each annual meeting. The Presi-
dent then appointed an Executive Com-
mittee of 30 members, as well as an addi-
tional member to serve as Chairman. The
Executive Committee made all preparations
for the annual meeting, including nomi-
nating candidates for the President and Vice
President positions, and audited the ac-
counts of the Treasurer. Starting in 1929, the
number of Vice Presidents of AOG was in-
creased to five and the Executive Committee
became known as the Board of Trustees. Fur-
thermore, the Trustees appointed for that
year were equally divided into three classes:
one appointed for one year, one appointed for
two years, and one appointed for three years.
In each successive year, another group of 10
grads were appointed to the Board of Trust-
ees to serve for a term of three years.
Then, in 1935, Piper, President at that
time, proposed the formation of another
body labeled the ‘‘Executive Committee.’’
This committee, which consisted of the
President and four Trustees (chosen by bal-
lot of the Board), would ‘‘possess and exer-
cise by a majority of its members all the
powers and duties of the Board of Trustees,’’
when it was not in session. Unfortunately, a
year later, learned that the election of this
Executive Committee was illegitimate, as it
was voted on by proxy, which was a practice
prohibited by New York State according to
the Association’s certificate of incorpora-
tion. In correcting this oversight, the Board
agreed to sweeping changes in AOG’s Con-
stitution and governance. First, Article III,
paragraph 2, was amended so that Associa-
tion members now directly elected Board of
Trustee members instead of the President
appointing them. Then, paragraph 5 of that
Article eliminated the Chairman of the
Board position, stating, ‘‘He is not necessary
and seldom has any knowledge of the oper-
ating affairs of the Association.’’ Finally,
the By-Laws were amended to eliminate ex-
cess Trustees (i.e., the President, the five
Vice Presidents, and the USMA Super-
intendent) and prescribe the duties of the
Board, Treasurer, and Secretary. This gov-
ernance model continued, with some minor
tweaks (e.g., increase the size of the Board in
1956 and adding an Executive Vice President
in 1972), for the next six decades.
After addressing its governance issues,
AOG turned its attention to the recurring
question of how to fund its operations. While
the Endowment Fund started out strong—
Bulletin No. 5 (1930) reported cash and pledge
contributions amounting to nearly $55,500 of
its $100,000 goal—the Great Depression obvi-
ously took its toll. By the mid–1930s, the As-
sociation was still approximately $25,000
short of the goal, and the fund’s $2,700 yearly
interest was not enough to cover AOG’s an-
nual expenses ($5,600–$6,000). Although rough-
ly 70 graduates a year were being dropped
from the Association’s member roll during
the height of the Depression for non-pay-
ment of annual dues, the Army Athletic As-
sociation, which also accepted support from
graduates, was able to remain on solid finan-
cial footing. Piper was dismayed by this situ-
ation, and other AOG leaders called on
younger graduates for support (contributions
generally came from classes prior to 1930). It
took a few more years, but in 1941, Frank
McCoy, Class of 1897 and AOG President, re-
ported, ‘‘Our funds have now reached sound,
healthy proportions,’’ with income exceeding
expenditures the preceding year by nearly
$8,000.
The Association of Graduates entered the
World War II era beginning to look like the
organization with which many are familiar
today. It had started to financially support
the Academy, first with the windows in the
Cadet Chapel and then in 1939 with furniture
for Quarters 100 (the ‘‘Superintendent’s
Quarters Fund’’); it had an effective govern-
ance model in which all operational deci-
sions were made by the President and the
Executive Committee, who were accountable
to the membership, and then carried out by
a small staff; and it had replaced the 350-
plus-page annual report with the more en-
gaging, less than 50-page ASSEMBLY maga-
zine, published quarterly. The state of the
Association was strong enough that in 1942
the Board debated the idea of lowering or
eliminating dues. The proposal failed, but it
signaled AOG leadership’s desire to remove
the burden of operating support coming pri-
marily from membership dues.
Looking to find a new income stream, the
West Point Alumni Foundation was estab-
lished on December 26, 1945 to solicit adver-
tising for ASSEMBLY and an annual (in-
stead of decennial) Register of Graduates.
The foundation’s incorporation marks the
transition from AOG’s second stage of his-
tory to its third phase of ‘‘Foundation and
Fundraising’’ (1946–94), where the Associa-
tion’s fundraising efforts for the Academy
increased in importance, and its growth cul-
minated with the opening of its new home,
the Herbert Alumni Center. This phase in
AOG history will be covered in the summer
issue of West Point magazine.’’

CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNI-

THE 19TH AMENDMENT
HON. F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, JR.
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to celebrate 100 years since the
U.S. House of Representatives passed the
19th Amendment, taking a monumental step
toward giving women the right to vote.
Women have always played an instrumental
role in shaping this country, yet lacked one of
the most fundamental rights. It wasn’t until
1919 that our nation righted this wrong and
millions of women earned the right to vote,
thereby gaining full citizenship.
A women’s suffrage amendment was first in-
troduced in Congress in 1878. It wasn’t until
41 years later that both the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Senate finally voted
to approve the 19th Amendment. The effort
then went on to the states, requiring the ap-
proval of three-quarters of state legislatures.
I am proud to say that the great state of
Wisconsin led the way. Wisconsin made his-
tory by becoming the first state to ratify the
19th amendment, granting national suffrage to
women. This early and important vote paved
the way for other states to follow suit.
Today is a day to celebrate the achieve-
ments of the women who made great sac-
rifices for suffrage. I especially want to thank
Speaker PELOSI, and Rebecca Kleefisch who
served as Executive Director of the Centennial
Commission, and all of the other members of
Commission for their tireless efforts to make
this day possible.

civil rights leader and legal trailblazer that our
country lost on April 28, 2019 at the age of 96.
When Judge Damon J. Keith was nomi-
nated by President Lyndon B. Johnson in
1967 to serve as Judge of the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Michi-
gan, it was at a time when there were very
few African American federal judges.
Judge Damon J. Keith said, ‘‘I never had a
black teacher. . . . There wasn’t a black po-
lice officer above the rank of sergeant. There
were no black judges. There were not black
elected officials.’’
Judge Damon J. Keith’s appointment to the
U.S. District Court was the same year that
Thurgood Marshall was nominated and con-
firmed to the Supreme Court Bench as an as-
sociate justice.
When Judge Damon J. Keith was later nom-
inated by President Jimmy Carter to serve on
the federal court of appeals, he was the sixth
African American appointed to serve on a U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
The sixth.
Judge Keith made a series of landmark de-
cisions that changed the social and legal land-
scape of this country throughout his 52 years
of service on the bench, including:
Davis v. School District of City of Pontiac,
309 F. Supp. 734 (E.D. Mich. 1970), which or-
dered citywide buses to integrate and helped
integrate Pontiac public schools.
Judge Keith stood up to the KKK with this
ruling and it became the first case to extend
federal court-ordered integration to the North.
Then, Judge Keith ruled that President
Nixon and U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell
did not have the right to wiretap in domestic
security cases without a court order in United
States v. United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297
(1972).
That same year Judge Keith ruled in Garrett
v. City of Hamtramck, 335 F. Supp. 16 (E.D.
Mich. 1971), that Hamtramck practiced so-
called ‘‘Negro removal’’ under the guise of
urban renewal and ordered the city to build
new public housing.
In Stamps v. Detroit Edison Co., 365 F.
Supp. 87 (E.D. 1973), Judge Keith ordered
Detroit Edison to pay 4 million to black em-
ployees and start an affirmative action pro-
gram in a historic job-discrimination case.
Furthering integration of public spaces and
jobs, in Baker v. City of Detroit, 483 F. Supp.
919 (E.D. 1979), Judge Keith ordered the De-
troit Police Department to carry out Detroit
Mayor, Coleman Young’s plan to integrate.
And in Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft, 195
F. Supp. 2d 937 (E.D. 2002), he upheld a
lower court’s decision prohibiting the Justice
Department from barring the public and press
from deportation hearings involving people
suspected of supporting terrorism.
Judge Keith did his job amid death threats
and the obstacles of racial bigotry.
Judge Keith’s dedication to civil rights and
civil liberties came from a life dealing with ra-
cial inequality as a solider and a young man.
Judge Damon J. Keith was born July 4,
1922.
Judge Keith was the grandson of slaves and
the son of a Ford factory worker who made 5
dollars a day.
Judge Keith was youngest of seven children
and he was the first member of his family to
earn a college degree.
Once Judge Keith graduated from college
during World War II in 1943, he enlisted in a
segregated U.S. Army.
Judge Keith recalled the three years he
spent in the Quartermaster Corps during
World War II in Europe as ‘‘absolutely degrad-
ing,’’ partly because the ‘‘all-colored’’ unit did
not have a single black officer.
After Judge Keith was discharged in 1946
as a sergeant, he returned home to experi-
ence White German soldiers riding in the front
seats of buses and dining in restaurants
where he was not welcome.
Judge Keith’s experience seeing African
American soldiers being treated with less re-
spect than White German prisoners of war,
made him vow to fight for civil rights here at
home.
So, Judge Keith attended and graduated
from Howard University Law School with his
JD in 1949.
While in law school, Judge Keith helped re-
search civil rights cases, participated in mock
trials and watched rising legal stars, like
Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP’s chief legal
counsel, practice his legal arguments and
argue cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.
After Judge Keith graduated law school in
1949, he went on to not only pass the bar but
found one of the first Black law firms in Detroit
city.
Judge Keith was a man dedicated to
change and as he climbed the legal ranks,
Judge Keith brought women and minorities up
with him, not just African-Americans but also
Hispanics and Asians.
Judge Keith hired more minorities law clerks
than any other federal judge and encouraged
those he helped to do the same for other
young minorities.
But, not only should Judge Keith be re-
warded for what he has done as judge, but for
what he has done as a man.
Judge Keith became the surrogate father
and guardian for Willie Horton, guiding the
young athlete from a troubled neighborhood
into manhood and to stardom with the Detroit
Tigers.
It was also Judge Keith who came to Rosa
Parks’s rescue in 1994 when the Civil Rights
icon had been attacked by a burglar in her
Detroit home.
Judge Keith helped her find a safe place to
live in the aftermath.
Judge Keith’s eldest daughter, Cecile Keith,
said Saturdays was spent with their father,
who would take them to dance classes, music
lessons, and choir rehearsals, and afterward
they would go out for hamburger and French
fries.
Judge Keith took his children to the movies,
Tiger games, played ball in their backyard,
and he taught them how to ride bikes.
Judge Keith was more than a civil rights ac-
tivist and he was more than a trailblazer.
Judge Keith was also a father and husband.
Judge Keith was a man dedicated to his
wife, family, and to his community.
Judge Keith has always been a beacon of
justice and we are a better country because of
his work and are forever in his debt.

Tuesday, May 21, 2019

to congratulate Michael Allen for his promotion
to National Chair of the Healthcare Financial
Management Association (HFMA). Mr. Allen
will rise from the position of Chief Financial
Officer at OSF Health Care in Peoria, Illinois.
Mr. Allen began his career after earning an
accounting degree from Illinois State Univer-
sity and a master’s degree in healthcare ad-

Mr. Allen then went on to gain more than 25
years of experience in business and the
healthcare industry—making him well qualified
to take on this new role with the nation’s larg-
est membership organization for healthcare fi-
nancial management executives and leaders.
Leadership experience is something Mr. Allen
gained in his 19 years as Chief Financial Offi-
cer for health systems and eight years in pub-
lic accounting. Mr. Allen is no stranger to
HFMA—he has been a member since 1993,
and has chaired the Board of Examiners and
served on the National Advisory Council. Mr.
Allen will bring a new set of eyes to HFMA,
having selected ‘‘Dare You to Move’’ as this
year’s theme to encourage members to get
out of their comfort zone. I want to thank Mr.
Allen for his work in healthcare and for his
service to the Peoria community.
It is because of dedicated leaders like Mi-
chael Allen that I am especially proud to serve

I am grateful for the steadfast support Sal-

aspiring artists by giving them opportunities to
succeed that they would not otherwise have
had.
Since 2003, Salvador’s business, the Frame
Factory, has delivered high-quality products

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Rick Jones
and the E. Richard Jones Family Foundation

Mr. Jones received a Bachelor of Arts from
Princeton University and a Master in Business
Administration from the Stanford Graduate

sided in the Napa Valley, Mr. Jones has been
deeply involved in and committed to our com-
munity. Mr. Jones has worked to better the
health and well-being of Napa residents
through his foundation, The E. Richard Jones
Family Foundation. The Foundation has been
critical to the success of Community Health
Initiative. The Foundation provided seed fund-
ing to Community Health Initiative to become
the first non-profit health insurance broker in
California that is motivated by the need to as-
sist vulnerable populations and provide access
to health care services in the public and pri-
vate markets. Additionally, The E. Richard
Jones Family Foundation was instrumental in
registering over 18,000 people for health in-
surance and providing them with access to
care.
Mr. Jones is active in our community in ad-
dition to his work with his foundation. He is a
current Board Member and former Board
President of the Napa Valley Vintners Asso-

ment of our community. It is therefore fitting

DENOUNCING FEMALE GENITAL
MUTILATION/CUTTING AS VIO-
LATING HUMAN RIGHTS OF
WOMEN AND GIRLS
SPEECH OF
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, May 20, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in support of H. Res. 106 denouncing
female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) and
urging the international community and the
Federal Government to increase efforts to
eliminate this harmful practice.
Female genital mutilation is a clear human
rights violation and must be ended imme-
diately.
In many parts of the world, female genital
mutilation is still performed by a religious lead-
er, town elder, or a medical professional with
limited training using crude instruments which
can include broken glass, kitchen knives, and
razor blades, however, antiseptics and anes-
thesia are rarely used.
Leaving these young women, many of which
are between the ages of 4 and 13, susceptible
to elevated risk of HIV transmission, hem-
orrhaging, chronic pelvic inflammation, septi-
cemia, and delayed menarche.
In about 15 percent of cases, infibulation,
the most severe form of FGM/C, involves the
removal of the labia and the suturing together
of the vulva.
This practice may place the victim’s life at
risk and victims of infibulation must be cut
open to have intercourse and may be repeat-
edly opened and closed at the husband’s will
to ensure fidelity.
The practice of FGM/C abroad has per-
sisted due to strong sociocultural influences
which ensure that it is secretly done and
underreported.
And despite many international efforts, anti-
FGM/C legislation has not ended the practice
in many countries.
FGM/C is still embraced by practitioners of
all the major faiths—Christianity, Islam and
traditional worship on the contents of Africa,
the Middle East, and Asia.
In the past, the U.S., largely through the
U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), and the World Health Organization

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E646 May 21, 2019
have made several recommendations des-
ignated to end the practice of FGM/C.
However, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, an estimated
513,000 women and girls in the United States
were at risk of, or had been subjected to, fe-
male genital mutilation, the United States must
be a beacon against this type of immoral prac-
tice.
That is why I, along with former Representa-
tive Joe Crowley, introduced the Zero Toler-
ance for Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Act,
supported by international human rights group
Equality Now, that required the federal govern-
ment to undertake a national study to provide
data on and insight into the prevalence of
FGM/C in the U.S. and establish a multi-agen-
cy strategy to bring the practice to an end.
Following the introduction of the Zero Toler-
ance for Female Genital Mutilation Act, I
partnered with 58 other members of Congress
to pen a bipartisan letter to the State, Health
& Human Services, and Education agencies,
the U.S. Agency for International Develop-
ment, the White House Office of Management
and Budget, calling for a cross-agency plan to
further fight FGM/C.
This letter included requests for resources
to help law enforcement, health workers, and
educators detect the practice here the United
States, plus a hotline for girls who may be in
danger of mutilation.
Given the abhorrent nature of this practice,
states should have in place laws that require
healthcare professionals, school employees,
and other professionals who work with chil-
dren to report any suspected practice of fe-
male genital mutilation to the appropriate law
enforcement entity.
FGM/C is currently a crime in 26 States, in-
cluding Michigan and Texas; it is also a Fed-
eral crime.
Around the world, at least five girls are muti-
lated, cut, every hour, and an estimated 100
million girls and 140 million women worldwide
are living with the consequences of FGM/C.
Even though, FGM/C has been banned in
the United States, since 1996, people continue
to engage in this abusive practice.
It is with great concern that I stand before
you today, still fighting to eradicate the prac-
tice of FGM/C globally.
Even more concerning is recently, The Jus-
tice Department stopped defending a federal
prohibition on female genital mutilation making
it difficult to combat this practice here at
home.
This recalcitrant act coincides with an
emerging view inside the Justice Department
that it is up to the Trump administration, not
members of Congress, to decide whether a
law has merit and should be enforced.
The World Health Organization has asserted
that FGM/C has no health benefits for women
and girls, and can have long-term negative im-
pacts on the physical, psychological, sexual,
reproductive health, and to their general well-
being.
We cannot be indifferent to this human
rights violation that puts so many lives at risk,
here in the United States, and around the
world.
H. Res. 106 makes clear that this practice
is rooted in gender inequality, gender-based
violence, and discrimination.
It affirms our dedication to protecting women
and girls globally and will help us accelerate
eradication and improve access to care for
survivors of this practice.
Because this intolerable practice has no
medical benefits, it has no place in our soci-
ety, and those who commit these horrendous
crimes should be held accountable for their
actions.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle to support this clearly bipartisan resolu-
tion.
Put aside partisanship and protect our
women and girls from this painful and archaic
practice.

a school counselor in the East Moline School
District for more than 25 years.
Ms. Dunn got her start at the University of
Illinois and University of Kansas before going
on to earn a master’s degree in School Coun-
seling from Eastern Illinois University. During
the course of her career, Ms. Dunn has
earned a reputation among her peers as a

being a positive resource for the students of
Glenview Middle School and someone they
can turn to. The ‘‘Builders Club’’ was estab-
lished by Ms. Dunn to fundraise and provide
gifts to other students and families in the area.
Additionally, she initiated GBAY, which oper-
ates in a similar concept to EBAY, where stu-
dents donate and then bid for holiday presents
for community members. Annual Career Fairs
are also a tradition jumpstarted by Ms. Dunn
and have even included visits by students to
local nursing homes. Ms. Dunn is an asset to

Dunn that I am especially proud to serve Illi-

I rise today along with my colleague, Con-
gressman COLIN ALLRED, to recognize and pay
tribute to the life and legacy of Debby Hay
Spradley, who passed away on Sunday, May
19, 2019.
A native Texan, Debby graduated from
Southern Methodist University and spent the
entirety of her professional career in the Dal-
las area, first as President of the Hay Agency,
Inc., and then as the Director of Development
and External Affairs at the Hockaday School.
She was respected in the Dallas community
for her wisdom as a mentor, her generosity as
a volunteer, and her leadership as an adminis-
trator.
She began her work with the school in the
early 1980s as a parent volunteer before
eventually joining the administrative team.
During her tenure, Debby served as both a
Member and the Chair of the Board of Trust-
ees; was a Member of the Leadership Team
for the Hockaday Tomorrow Capital Campaign
and the Campaign Executive Committee for
the Centennial Campaign; Co-Chaired the
2004 HP A Benefit; Chaired the Annual Fund
Campaign; and was rightfully named an Hon-
orary Alum in 2000. We admire and honor
Debby’s selfless dedication to the Hockaday
School.
Debby is survived by her husband Webb;
daughter Jessica Werner Epperson and her
husband Doug Epperson; daughter Rachel
Hay Spradley and her fiancé Jonathan Ben-
Horin; and three wonderful granddaughters
Kathryn, Virginia, and Margaret.
I ask my colleagues to join us in remem-
bering Debby and her contributions to her
family, her community, and the Hockaday
School. The Dallas community is better off be-
cause of her. We will miss her dearly.

Ken Yager calling for the TVA to make all
board meetings open to the public.
[From Knoxville News Sentinel, on Apr. 14,
2019]
AN OPEN LETTER TO TVA’S NEW CEO: YOU
NEED TO BE THE LEADER YOUR PREDECESSOR
WAS NOT, HERE’S HOW
(Unauthored Editorial)
Welcome to Tennessee, Mr. Lyash.
No doubt you had a busy first week as the
new CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
And what a responsibility!
You lead the nation’s first and largest re-
gional planning and economic development
agency owned and operated by the federal
government.
You provide power for some 10 million peo-
ple, and you employ thousands in our state.
You’ve taken over an organization whose
history and legacy are revolutionary and in-
spiring. Few organizations have transformed
the lives of so many people, across so many
generations. And we know you believe deeply
in this mission, a mission derived from dec-
ades of service to improving the lives of the
people of the Tennessee Valley.
This is what has brought you to Knoxville.
Which is why today we challenge you to be
the leader your predecessor was not.
We challenge you to launch a fully inde-
pendent and transparent investigation of
safety and workplace practices that occurred
in the aftermath of the massive Kingston
coal ash spill and cleanup—not just the
TVA’s own practices, but those of every one
of the contractors and subcontractors it em-
ploys. We’ve reported extensively about the
workers who have died, and the hundreds of
others who are sick, after their exposure to
the toxic ash. Learn from the mistakes of
the past and demand accountability.
We challenge you to commit to a top-to-
bottom review and overhaul of workplace
safety at every power plant you operate.
Last week we reported about workers at two
Tennessee plants who are exposed to fly ash
dust and flue gas without masks or res-
pirators.
We challenge you to review your relation-
ship with Jacobs Engineering. Although the
case goes on, a federal jury already found Ja-
cobs breached its contract with the TVA and
its duty to ensure the health of cleanup
workers. Yet you’re still doing hundreds of
millions of dollars of business with the com-
pany.
We challenge you to hire an independent
consultant to radically remake your internal
reporting and whistle-blowing procedures
and make sure they are accessible to your
contractors as well. Your people are ada-
mant no one should fear workplace retalia-
tion, yet your workers are coming to us be-
cause they don’t trust TVA.
We challenge you to rid the agency of dou-
ble-speak and misdirection—where it’s cul-
turally acceptable to mislead the public, as
Bill Johnson did when he said that the EPA,
the Tennessee Department of Environment
and Conservation and OSHA were on site
daily during the Kingston cleanup. Today at
the TVA it’s acceptable for your official
spokesman to recraft this as mere hyperbole.
Finally, we challenge you to visit your em-
ployees in the field. Talk to them. Not with
an entourage, not with a phalanx of handlers
who will hand-select the ones who’ll say the
‘‘right’’ things to you. You need to hear the
truth. You need to visit sick men in hos-
pitals and listen to their stories. You need to
sit down in the lunchroom with truck drivers
who are around fly ash all day. You need to
walk through the plant, see things yourself.
And then you need to do the right thing.
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 192
By Senators Yager, Kurita, and
Representative Powers
A Resolution to express support for the en-
actment of legislation that requires all
board committee meetings of the Tennessee
Valley Authority Board of Directors to be
open to the public.
Whereas, established in 1933, the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) is a corporate agen-
cy of the United States that provides elec-
tricity for business customers and local
power companies, serving ten million people
in parts of seven southeastern states; and
Whereas, TVA also provides flood control,
navigation, and land management for the
Tennessee River system and assists local
power companies and state and local govern-
ments with economic development and job
creation; and
Whereas, Tennessee Congressman Tim
Burchett has introduced the Tennessee Val-
ley Authority Transparency Act of 2019, leg-
islation to require that committee meetings
and subcommittee meetings of the Tennessee
Valley Authority Board of Directors be
transparent and open to the public; and
Whereas, the bill would amend the Ten-
nessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 Section
2(g)(2) to include a provision on transparency
that would require meetings of the TVA
Board to be held in public, properly noticed,
and with minutes and summaries of each
meeting made available; and
Whereas, it is vitally important to the citi-
zens of Tennessee that TVA, as an entity cre-
ated and protected by Congress, should con-
duct their business in the open and be as
transparent as possible: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred
Eleventh General Assembly of the State of Ten-
nessee, The House of Representatives concur-
ring, That we strongly support the passage of
the Tennessee Valley Authority Trans-
parency Act of 2019; and be it further
Resolved, That an appropriate copy of this
resolution be prepared and transmitted to
the Speaker and the Clerk of the United
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent and the Secretary of the United States
Senate, and each member of Tennessee’s del-
egation to the United States Congress.

HONORING VICE ADMIRAL ALBERT
CALLAND, III
HON. TROY BALDERSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and honor the professional
achievements of a fellow Zanesville High
School graduate, Vice Admiral Albert (Bert)
Calland, III.
Vice Admiral Calland is being commemo-
rated in our hometown for his tremendous ca-
reer, which has spanned many decades, and
forms the model life of a selfless calling to
public service in defense of this country. From
the United States Navy to SEAL Team ONE,
from the Central Intelligence Agency and the
National Counterterrorism Center to CACI
International, Inc., Admiral Calland has always
displayed the dedication of a consummate
man of service.
After graduating from the United States
Naval Academy in 1974, Admiral Calland dis-
tinguished himself in the ranks of the U.S.
Navy and Special Operations Command, gain-
ing the respect of juniors, peers, and superior
officers alike. His impressive qualities of hard
work and strategic problem-solving helped Ad-
miral Calland advance in his field. By the time
of the terrorist attacks that devastated our na-
tion on September 11, 2001, Admiral Calland
was a key guiding force in the United States’
fight against those who seek to do us harm.
As our hometown gathers to recognize this
ardent patriot, I salute him for his ongoing
service above self. Admiral Calland can take
great pride in all he has accomplished and in
the impact his legacy will leave. I thank Vice
Admiral Calland for bringing honor to Zanes-
ville, Ohio, and in turn, I honor him for his in-
credible record of achievement.

HONORING PETE RICHMOND
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Pete Richmond
as the Napa Valley Grower of the Year for
2019.
Mr. Richmond’s career in agriculture began
in 1986 after earning a degree in Agricultural
Business from California State University,
Fresno. He gained valuable experience as a
viticulturist while working at Bien Nacido Vine-
yards. Mr. Richmond went on to work for
many prestigious wineries. In 1992 he was at
Stag’s Leap Winery; he worked at Atlas Peak
Winery from 1993 to 1995; from 1995 to 2001
he was at Kendall Jackson. Mr. Richmond
founded the Silverado Farming Company, a
vineyard management company, in 2001.
Many of the finest wineries and vineyards in
the Napa Valley contract with Silverado Farm-
ing Company to manage their vineyards. The
company oversees vineyard management for
over 650 acres of grapes.
Mr. Richmond’s passion for agriculture is
not confined to the vineyard. He is involved in
our community—through his philanthropic con-
tributions and the Boards on which he sits. In
2006, Mr. Richmond established the One Per-
cent for the Community Fund, a foundation
that receives one percent of gross revenue
profits made by the Silverado Farming Com-
pany. The foundation uses the money to sup-
port at-risk youth in our community and helps
find a solution for a variety of issues that im-
pact farm workers. Mr. Richmond is on the
Farmworker Foundation Board of Directors,
OLE Health Operating Board, and the OLE
Health Foundation Board. He is also an Advi-
sory Board Member for Teens Connect, a
member of the Marketing Committee for the
Napa Valley Community Foundation, and a
past member of the Napa Valley
Grapegrower’s Board of Directors. He is active
in the housing community as a member of
Napa Valley Community Housing and Napa
County Housing Commission. Mr. Richmond is
also involved with Ag for Youth and is a
former Babe Ruth Baseball League Coach.
Madam Speaker, Mr. Richmond is the com-
munity member we should all strive to be. He
is a person of integrity, is generous and car-
ing, and well-deserving of the title Napa Valley
2019 Grower of the Year. It is therefore fitting
and proper that we honor Pete Richmond here
today.

IN RECOGNITION OF ROSEMARIE
MYRDAL
HON. KELLY ARMSTRONG
OF NORTH DAKOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor an outstanding constituent and
public servant, Rosemarie Myrdal.
Rosemarie’s tremendous career and life is a
testament to her strong spirit, hard work, and
determination.
Rosemarie was born in Minot in 1929, grad-
uated from Fargo Central High School, and
earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Edu-
cation from North Dakota Agricultural College.
She married John Myrdal in 1952 and the cou-
ple began farming near Edinburg and raising
five children.
Rosemarie’s public service to the state
began in 1984, when she was elected to the
North Dakota House of Representatives. In
1992, Rosemarie was elected as the first Re-
publican woman to serve as Lieutenant Gov-
ernor in North Dakota history. She served
alongside Governor Ed Schafer from 1992 to
2000.
Rosemarie continued her service to her
community after her terms as Lieutenant Gov-
ernor, staying active in the Edinburg School
Board, the Icelandic Communities Association,
the National Trust for Historic Preservation,
the North Dakota Diabetes Association, the
North Dakota Library Coordinating Council,
Preservation North Dakota, and Red River Re-
source Conservation and Development.
May 19 was Rosemarie’s 90th birthday. On
this special occasion, I send her warmest
greetings on behalf of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and blessings to her and her fam-
ily.

COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE 19TH AMEND-
MENT
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the centennial of the
19th amendment.
Such an achievement as women’s suffrage,
long overdue, was not the result of one grand
swoop of action. It took a million little steps
from women across the country. A million little
steps from women who wore the sash or car-
ried the torch in their own way, a million little
steps from those who marched in the streets
or stood up for their place in the direction of
our country.
Let us follow their example today.
I am reminded of my mother. In 1933, at the
age of 20, she wrote a charge for women. It
was just over a decade after the 19th amend-
ment. She wrote, and I quote:
‘‘It is not my intention to be critical, rather
my motive in writing this article is to encour-
age the female members of this organization
to take a more active part in its affairs. We are
not living in the middle ages when a woman’s
part in life was merely to serve her master in
her home, but we have gradually taken our
place in every phase of human endeavor, and
even in the here-to-fore stronghold of the male
sex: politics.
‘‘I have noticed that the girls, unlike the
men, are timid in asserting themselves, and
many a good idea is lost, having been sup-
pressed by its creator. Come on girls, let’s
make ourselves heard.’’
It will take another million little steps to
move this cou—ntry forward in all the ways it
must. On health care, on reproductive rights,
on equal pay, on education, and more. So,
come on girls, let us make ourselves heard.

COMMEMORATING THE ONE HUN-
DREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
WOMEN’S RIGHT TO VOTE
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the one hundredth anniversary
of the women’s right to vote.
Madam Speaker I am the youngest of 12,
raised by a single mother on a Social Security
check. To say I understand the power of
women would be an understatement.
That is why today, on the centennial anni-
versary, I rise to applaud and celebrate the
passage of the 19th amendment which gave
women in this country the right to vote.
Representing Seneca Falls, NY I under-
stand all that generations of brave and intel-
ligent women went through to bring us to the
100th anniversary of the women’s right to
vote.
The Seneca Falls Convention, right in New
York 23, was the first women’s rights conven-
tion in the United States.
Held in July 1848, the meeting launched the
women’s suffrage movement, which more than
seven decades later ensured women the right
to vote.
Despite scarce publicity, 300 people—most-
ly area residents—showed up. There this
group of strong women demanded the right to
vote sparking a 70-year push for this essential
right.
But the fight is not over.
This is why I have been a strong advocate
of the equal rights amendment. We are so
close to ratification with just 1 more state
needed to ratify.
So as I stand here with this yellow rose on
my lapel signaling my support for women’s
right to vote, I want everyone to know this
rose means much more to me.
It means my support of equal rights to
women.

IN CELEBRATION OF THE LIFE OF
MR. JOHN SUTTON
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to salute a veteran of the U.S. Army
from Independence, Missouri, for his heroism
and dedication to a life long career serving our
country. As a young boy in Hutchinson, Kan-
sas, brave soldiers inspired Mr. Sutton to join
the ranks of the millions of women and men
serving in our military.
A man of unwavering grit and tenacity, Mr.
Sutton was not discouraged when his applica-
tion to join the Army and Navy Air Corps was
denied due to his color-blindness. He was
studying at the University of Kansas when he
was drafted into the Army in 1944. After his
conscription, Mr. Sutton attended West Point
and received his Bachelor of Science in 1949
from the Army Engineering school. This wealth
of knowledge eventually led Mr. Sutton and
his wife Dana to travel internationally to Ger-
many with the Army.
Using his engineering skills and personal
fortitude, Mr. Sutton served the U.S. Army’s
Engineering and Transportation units in Ger-
many. During his time there, Mr. Sutton
worked with an all-black Engineering Battalion
where he learned the meaning of service and
brotherhood. To this day, Mr. Sutton cherishes
the time he spent with that battalion. Years
later, Mr. Sutton honored his time spent with
the battalion by creating a course focusing on
Black Men in the U.S. Army.
Mr. Sutton eventually returned to the U.S.
and furthered his education by receiving a
Master’s in Business Administration with an
emphasis in Transportation Management.
Shortly thereafter, he once again served his
country as a professor of mathematics at the
U.S. Military Academy at West Point for three
years.
Mr. Sutton took classes until he was once
again sent to Korea in the 1st Calvary Divi-
sion. Being both an energetic scholar and
dedicated service member, Mr. Sutton eventu-
ally returned to Virginia to work for the Pen-
tagon. At the Pentagon, he was an assistant
to a three-star general, a position which led
him to travel all around the world. For in-
stance, this occurred when the U.S. Army sent
Mr. Sutton to Vietnam, where he oversaw a
battalion of 3,000 troops and spent countless
days and nights living under the fear of an at-
tack.
Upon his return to the States, he became a
Colonel and was sent to Pennsylvania for 3
more years. After teaching and serving in Ger-
many and Fort Leavenworth, Mr. Sutton was
ready to return home to care for his family and
his elderly parents. As a retiree from the
Army, Mr. Sutton began working at Park Uni-
versity first as the supervisor of their Military
Extension Program and later as the Assistant
Dean of the University.
A man who pursues his passions and goals,
Mr. Sutton received his private pilot’s license
and eventually bought his own plane. To this
day, he flies his plane at Fort Leavenworth.
Today, Mr. Sutton’s extensive military history
is honored at Veterans Hall in the Truman Me-
morial Building.
In addition to his 35 years of active duty
service, he has been married for 69 years of
marriage with two children, his five grand-
children, and four great-grandchildren. Though
their travels have taken them all over the
world, we are fortunate to have Mr. Sutton and
his wife call Independence, Missouri, their
home.
Madam Speaker, please join me and all of
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District in con-
gratulating Mr. Sutton for his 35 years of ac-
tive duty service and outstanding accomplish-
ments. It is with great respect that I urge all
my colleagues and fellow citizens across the

SUPPORTING H. RES. 354
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in support of H. Res. 354, which
celebrates the 100th anniversary of the 19th
Amendment passing this body. This centennial
is a moment to celebrate the women who
fought to make the right to vote a reality for all
women and to honor their dedication to our
nation. As we gather to reflect on this impor-
tant cause, it is important to recognize that be-
cause of generations of women’s commitment
to our democracy, today I serve along with a
record number of women in the United States
Congress.
As a Member of Congress, I recognize that
the right to vote is the most precious right of
any American citizen. It is the collective re-
sponsibility of all today to preserve what gen-
erations of women before us fought to earn,
and I am committed to continuing this great
legacy for the sake of this country and the fu-
ture of our democracy.
Even with these historic moments, our work
is far from over as women still struggle for the
right to equal pay and the right to affordable
health care. Today, let us reaffirm our commit-
ment to removing barriers that prevent women
in America and around the world from achiev-
ing their full potential.
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this resolution honoring the centennial
of the House passage of the 19th Amend-
ment. I yield back the balance of my time.

HONORING DENNIS PEDISICH
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 21, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Dennis Pedisich
for his involvement with Community Health Ini-
tiative and his leadership in providing health
insurance to residents of Napa County.
Mr. Pedisich has been active in our commu-
nity since earning his Master in Business Ad-
ministration from Santa Clara University. He
sat on the Community Health Initiative Board
of Directors for nine years. During his time on
the Board, he held many positions, including
that of Vice President. Mr. Pedisich has self-
lessly given many hours of his time to Com-
munity Health Initiative, which has provided
over 18,000 uninsured individuals with health
insurance and access to care.
Mr. Pedisich has been active in our commu-
nity in other positions as well. He has been
the President of the Napa Valley College
Foundation, the Justin-Siena High School
Board of Trustees, and the Kiwanis Club of
Napa Valley. He also sits on the Board of
Trustees for the Queen of the Valley Medical
Center. As the former President of Napa Com-
munity Bank and Vice President of Rabobank,
Mr. Pedisich has shared his expertise of the fi-
nance community with the local non-profit sec-
tor and has helped many businesses thrive
through his generosity with his time and
knowledge.
Madam Speaker, Mr. Pedisich is an active
member of our community who uses his ex-
pertise to assist others and help important
local institutions, such as the Community
Health Initiative, thrive. Community Health Ini-
tiative has been able to reach such a large
number of Napa residents in no small part be-
cause of Mr. Pedisich. It is therefore fitting and
proper that we honor Dennis Pedisich here
today.
