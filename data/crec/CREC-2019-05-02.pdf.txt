PRAYER
Reverend Jonathan Falwell, Thomas
Road Baptist Church, Lynchburg, Vir-
ginia, offered the following prayer:
Our gracious Heavenly Father, we
thank You for this great Nation that
we call home. We thank You for bless-
ing us so greatly through these 243
years of American history.
The Bible says: ‘‘Blessed is the na-
tion whose God is the Lord.’’ So, today,
Father, we ask Your forgiveness for the
sins that we as a people, and we as a
nation, have committed which have led
us away from You.
We pray that You grant wisdom and
guidance to all who serve in this room.
We ask You to give clear direction as
they set the course for our Nation, and
we pray that You lead them as they
lead us. We ask You to protect those
who serve this Nation both here and
around the globe.
And we ask You to continue to bless
this great Nation that we call home.
In Jesus’ name we pray, amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman
from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON)
come forward and lead the House in the
Pledge of Allegiance.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania led

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
WELCOMING REVEREND
JONATHAN FALWELL
The SPEAKER. Without objection,
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
CLINE) is recognized for 1 minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize our guest chaplain,
the Reverend Jonathan Falwell of
Thomas Road Baptist Church in
Lynchburg, Virginia.
Reverend Falwell has long been a
leader in his community, the Common-
wealth of Virginia, and the United
States. His sermons are delivered to
thousands each week at Thomas Road,
on television, and through the inter-
net. Jonathan Falwell followed in the
footsteps of his father, Dr. Jerry
Falwell, as senior pastor of Thomas
Road Baptist Church.
Jerry Falwell was founder of Liberty
University, one of the largest Christian
universities in the United States. In
addition to his role as senior pastor at
Thomas Road, Reverend Jonathan
Falwell also serves as executive vice
president of spiritual affairs at Lib-
erty.
On this National Day of Prayer, I ex-
tend my thanks to Jonathan Falwell
for his devotion to Christ, his family,
and his community.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER
PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CASTEN of Illinois). The Chair will en-
tertain up to five further requests for
1-minute speeches on each side of the
aisle.
f
MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF
CLIMATE CHANGE
(Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, last year
was an abject failure in addressing the
climate crisis. In both policy and real-
world emission reductions in the U.S.
and globally, we fell short. We cannot
afford another year like it, and yet,
2019 is off to an ominous start.
The consequences of inaction on cli-
mate change are both dire and famil-
iar. The lives and livelihoods of mil-
lions across the country and billions
around the world are at risk.
Climate change is a national security
threat, a food security threat, a hous-
ing issue, a transportation issue, an in-
frastructure issue, an immigration
issue, a jobs issue, an energy issue, a fi-
nancial issue, and a public health issue.
We cannot, in good conscience, claim
to be adequately representing the peo-
ple of our districts and our country and
the world if we ignore or deny the dan-
gers that climate change poses to the
American public and the world.
I stand here in strong support of H.R.
9, the Climate Action Now Act, to re-
verse the shameful and dangerous
course of the last 2 years and meet the
challenge of climate change head-on.
f
NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, today we
observe the 68th annual National Day
of Prayer, a day dedicated to bringing
men and women of all faiths together
in prayer for this great Nation.
Statistically, only about 14 percent
of Americans read the Bible and pray
on a daily basis. That is why this
year’s theme focuses on our love for
one another, just as we learned in the
teachings of Jesus in John 13:34: Love
one another just as I have loved you.
This theme is just as important in
our Nation today as it has been
throughout our history. Right now,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3410 May 2, 2019
America is a divided nation, and we are
fighting for the values that this great
country was founded upon. More than
anything else we need unity.
Mark 3:24 says: If a kingdom is di-
vided against itself, that kingdom can-
not stand. But to find unity, we must
put our faith before our politics. We
must do what is right for the American
people. Why? Because our faith unites
us in Christ.
Jesus prayed for us, in John 21:17,
that: All of them may be one, Father,
just as You are in me and I am in You.
May they also be in us, so that the
world may believe that You have sent
me.
I encourage all Americans to join me
in celebrating the National Day of
Prayer and humbly come before God to
seek his guidance on how we may be-
come one America.
f
A FIRST STEP TOWARDS THE
FUTURE OF CLIMATE ACTION
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it
was an honor to preside over the House
during the debate on H.R. 9 yesterday
to uphold our commitment to the Paris
climate accord, our first real piece of
climate legislation in over 9 years. It
may have been an honor, but it was jar-
ring to listen to my Republican col-
leagues in denial.
For decades, Americans have seen
with their own eyes rising sea levels,
extreme weather events, and tempera-
ture increases, all terrifying prospects
for our children and grandchildren, yet
Republicans are defending the Trump
administration’s action to undercut
and isolate the United States as the
only country to withdraw from the cli-
mate accord, placing us firmly on the
wrong side of history.
In contrast, I am thankful that to-
day’s action demonstrates that Demo-
crats are on the side of protecting our
children’s future. H.R. 9 is a first step
towards a future of climate action and
climate justice, a Green New Deal for
clean energy jobs, rebuilding and re-
newing our infrastructure, sustainable
agriculture, and environmental justice.
We can’t afford to wait, and neither
can the planet.
f
HONORING BEN REIFEL
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.
Speaker, in 1961, South Dakota’s Ben
Reifel became our Nation’s first
Lakota Indian in Congress.
He grew up dirt poor in a log cabin in
rural Todd County. He dropped out
after eighth grade but later graduated
from South Dakota State and from
Harvard.
Ben Reifel was respected in this
Chamber. That gentleman was re-
spected in Indian Country. You see,
throughout his career at the Bureau of
Indian Affairs and for a decade here in
Congress, he worked tirelessly to fur-
ther economic opportunity for Amer-
ican Indians. Ben Reifel celebrated
education, hard work, and self-deter-
mination.
Yesterday, I filed a bill asking that
Ben Reifel’s name be placed on the
Mission Post Office. It is my hope that
young American Indian boys and girls
will see that name and realize that
great American leaders have come, and
will come again, from that place.
f
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE
(Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in strong support of H.R. 9,
the Climate Action Now Act, to ensure
that the U.S. remains part of the Paris
climate agreement.
Report after scientific report has told
us that, when it comes to climate
change, we are on a precipice. The sta-
tus quo leads us over the cliff. The only
way back is with immediate and ear-
nest action. That is all of us together.
The Paris Agreement was meant to
be a collective first step toward begin-
ning to address climate change. We
have a duty to ourselves, to our chil-
dren, and to the rest of the world to
not only join in that step forward, but
to lead it.
I urge my colleagues to join with me
in supporting H.R. 9.
f
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FOSTER
CARE MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
May as National Foster Care Month.
This is a time to recognize more than
400,000 foster youth in America. During
this month, we renew our commitment
to ensuring that every child has a safe
and loving home.
Mr. Speaker, I am a member of the
Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth,
and to this day, I have a foster brother
as part of my family. I know firsthand
how a loving, supportive home can
make all of the difference in a young
person’s life.
More than 200,000 children enter the
foster care system every year, which
translates to a child entering care
every 2 minutes.
All children deserve a safe, loving,
and permanent home. We have a re-
sponsibility to continue to create poli-
cies that will improve outcomes in the
overall well-being of foster youth and
their families.
I thank every foster parent, volun-
teer, and mentor who works to make
sure that the needs of our children are
not only being met, but giving them
the opportunity to thrive in a loving
home.
f
LEAD ON THE CRISIS OF CLIMATE
CHANGE
(Mr. HIMES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to address the opportunity we have
today to lead on the crisis of climate
change.
The climate change crisis is unlike
any other that we have faced. It cannot
be defeated on the battlefield; it can-
not be cured; it cannot be wished away;
and it, certainly, can no longer be de-
nied.
What we can do is what we have al-
ways done and lead the community of
nations to address a problem that
would leave our children and their
grandchildren with an unbelievable cri-
sis and possibly a planet that they can
no longer inhabit.
The Paris climate agreement was a
set of targets that we developed that
are not mandatory. The Paris climate
agreement is about making a state-
ment that this is a problem and a cri-
sis, and that America will lead.
Today, this Chamber has an oppor-
tunity to say, yes, we will lead. We will
not hide from the problem. We will not
let this crisis distract us. We will lead.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 9 today and to send a
statement to the world that, as we
have always done, we will lead on this
global crisis.
f
RECOGNIZING HOLOCAUST
REMEMBRANCE DAY
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
join our friends in Israel and in the
Jewish communities around the world
in recognizing Israel’s Holocaust Re-
membrance Day.
President Trump took the unprece-
dented step of proclaiming this week
Holocaust Remembrance Week, and
solidarity is one of our strongest allies
in the entire Jewish community.
With the recent rise in anti-Semitic
rhetoric amongst some, even in this
House, it is important that we remem-
ber just how horrific and dangerous
these ideas truly are.
More than 6 million Jewish people
died at the hands of the Nazis during
the Holocaust. Many who survived will
never be able to escape the horrors of
their experience. They emerged into a
world that has changed them forever.
But the world has changed since
then, too. No longer is that sort of ha-
tred and bigotry to be accepted, and
that is what we must affirm on this Na-
tional Day of Prayer, via prayer, via
our actions, for Jewish people as well

HEALTHCARE
(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to discuss our
work in the House to advance innova-
tive solutions to improve access to af-
fordable healthcare for people in my
district in New Hampshire and across
the country.
Over the past 2 weeks I have had the
opportunity to visit with hospitals and
providers throughout my district to
discuss the challenges facing
healthcare in my State. I have heard
consistently that the efforts of the
Trump administration to sabotage the
Affordable Care Act are causing serious
anxiety for patients and healthcare
providers.
The American people have made
clear they want Democrats and Repub-
licans to work together to improve ac-
cess to affordable healthcare and to
abandon the partisanship that has seen
protections for individuals with pre-
existing conditions threatened and ac-
cess to healthcare restricted.
I am excited that next week the
House will pass innovative legislation
that will have a real impact on the
lives of hardworking families, includ-
ing my bill to protect people with pre-
existing conditions. We are advancing
pragmatic solutions and stabilizing and
strengthening the Affordable Care Act.
f
CELEBRATING OUR NATIONAL
LIBRARIES
(Mr. MARSHALL asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, re-
cently we celebrated our national li-
braries. I rise today to discuss the im-
portant role they play across many
Kansas communities.
I have visited libraries throughout
The Big First, stopping in Manhattan,
Salina, Dodge City, Quinter, Great
Bend, and Scott City. I recently visited
the Marion City Library that was
awarded the 2019 five-star honor for its
welcoming facility with well-targeted
programs.
Communities from Colby to Abilene
have partnered with organizations such
as the Library of Congress, National
Archives, and Smithsonian Institution
to shine a spotlight on the great quali-
ties and rich history that is unique to
Kansas. These programs, run by our
local libraries, are vitally important to
our small communities and reached
more than 27,000 Kansans in 2018.
I am so proud of our Kansas libraries
that are constantly going above and
beyond.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
KUSTER of New Hampshire). Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 329 and rule
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in
the Committee of the Whole House on
the State of the Union for the further
consideration of the bill, H.R. 9.
Will the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
further consideration of the bill (H.R.
9) to direct the President to develop a
plan for the United States to meet its
nationally determined contribution
under the Paris Agreement, and for
other purposes, with Mr. CASTEN of Illi-
nois (Acting Chair) in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The Acting CHAIR. When the Com-
mittee of the Whole rose on Wednes-
day, May 1, 2019, amendment No. 20
printed in House Report 116–42 offered
by the gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs.
LEE) had been disposed of.
AMENDMENT NO. 21 OFFERED BY MR. KIM
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 21 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 7, line 25, strike ‘‘; and’’ and insert a
semicolon.
Page 8, line 5, strike ‘‘Agreement.’’ and in-
sert ‘‘Agreement; and’’.
Page 8, after line 5, insert the following
paragraph:
(3) how the Paris Agreement’s loss and
damage provisions would affect infrastruc-
ture resiliency in the United States.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. KIM) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chairman, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amend-
ment to H.R. 9.
My amendment is straightforward.
This bill requires the President to sub-
mit a plan to Congress to meet our ob-
ligations under the Paris accord. This
amendment ensures that we do not for-
get the impact of our infrastructure
when addressing the threat of climate
change.
We know that climate change is real.
We know that we are already feeling
its effects and that it will only inten-
sify. Strong scientific research tells us
that storms are getting stronger and
more frequent. Sea levels are rising,
and this poses a direct threat to our
coastal communities.
While this bill and the Paris accord
take significant steps to address the
root causes of climate change, we must
be prepared to address the significant
impact it is having on our Nation’s in-
frastructure today.
My district in New Jersey was among
the hardest hit by Superstorm Sandy.
Toms River alone saw $2.25 billion in
property damages, the highest out of
any township in New Jersey, and we
are still recovering from that storm
that hit our State years ago.
In 2017 we saw three of the five cost-
liest storms in our history in Harvey,
Maria, and Irma. Rising sea levels are
increasing the severity and frequency
of flooding and are contributing to
beach erosion, posing a major threat to
our coastal tourism economy.
Climate change isn’t just measured
by rising tides and rising temperatures.
It is measured by the rising costs that
will incur on our communities and the
investment needed in infrastructure to
keep our communities resilient in the
face of that threat.
In the coming months, as we hope-
fully take up and pass a bold infra-
structure package, this amendment
will provide guidance towards achiev-
ing the infrastructure resiliency our
communities need. We know that infra-
structure improvements don’t only
need to come in the form of potholes
fixed and bridges rebuilt, they need to
lessen the impact of rising storm
surges from the next big storm and
make sure communities like mine in
Ocean County can remain a place for
people to raise a family, create jobs,
and achieve the American Dream.
The Paris Agreement’s loss and dam-
age provision recognizes the impor-
tance of updating our infrastructure to
help communities deal with the ad-
verse impacts of climate change. I urge
that we include this amendment be-
cause it is crucial that there is an un-
derstanding from top to bottom of the
threat that climate change poses and
the impact that it will have toward in-
frastructure resiliency across our coun-
try.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment and ensure
we are not only protecting our climate
but the infrastructure we need to sup-
port our communities, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3412 May 2, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time to close.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), who is the Speaker
of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I com-
mend him for his leadership.
This issue of infrastructure resil-
iency is so important. We are now dis-
cussing doing major infrastructure leg-
islation to rebuild America in a way
that is making it safer, by promoting
commerce and improving the quality of
life by decreasing the amount of time
people have to spend in their cars. By
increasing broadband and all of the
things that enable people, whether it is
healthcare, education, or commerce,
the infrastructure is so central to that.
When we talk about infrastructure,
we have to talk about resiliency; and
when we talk about climate change, we
have to talk about infrastructure. So
this is a very important amendment,
and I rise to support it.
I thank the gentleman for sharing his
New Jersey experience in terms of the
need for resiliency in this very wise
amendment.
I also want to rise in support of H.R.
9, the Climate Action Now Act. I com-
mend Chairwoman KATHY CASTOR who
is the chair of our House Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis and also
the chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee, Mr. ENGEL, for his leader-
ship on this important issue which is
under the jurisdiction of his com-
mittee. They bring vision, they bring
values, and they bring the voices of
Members and the American people to
make a difference.
We thank our freshman Members, in
particular, who have carried the prior-
ities of their communities to Congress
to demand climate action now. And I
think it is very appropriate that the
gentleman in the chair is on the House
Select Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis and has been a leader in the private
sector, now in the public sector, on this
important issue as we go forward.
It is time, Mr. Chairman, to end de-
nial about this and start listening to
the facts. This is about science,
science, science. An overwhelming
number, 86 percent, of Americans know
that this is a crisis. They know that
human behavior has an impact on it,
and they want us to act.
We all have stories from our commu-
nities.
One of my constituents wrote:
My daughter has developed asthma. It
wrenches me to see her used as a canary in
a coal mine. We are literally choking on the
denial and inaction.
Another writes:
Green jobs are guaranteed local jobs and
will put people to work. Survival is now
poised to become a viable economic sector.
Let me just say that this is about
jobs, jobs, jobs. It is very important for
our country to be preeminent in the
world on the green technologies, and
this legislation is in recognition of
that. It is about public health, about
clean air and clean water, the air our
children breathe and the water they
drink, and it is about environmental
justice in that regard as well that all
children will be able to live in a safe,
clean environment in which they can
thrive.
It is about our national security.
Over and over again the national secu-
rity experts, the generals and the ad-
mirals, have come to us and said that
this is a global security issue, because
of what impact the climate change cri-
sis is doing to the use of water and ac-
cess to food and how natural disasters
affect migration and also how that can
lead to initiation of hostilities among
people. It is a national security issue in
terms of how we use our resources for
our national security as well.
It is a moral issue. If you believe, as
I and some in the evangelical commu-
nity do, that this planet is God’s cre-
ation and we have a moral responsi-
bility to be good stewards of it, then
you would be sure to be a good steward
and sign up for climate action now.
But even if you don’t share that reli-
gious belief, we all know that we have
a moral responsibility to the next gen-
eration to pass this planet on in a bet-
ter way than we found it in a very re-
sponsible way.
So it is we must take action. The bill
demands action now, by keeping us in
the only international agreement dedi-
cated to ending the climate crisis and
demanding a plan of action from the
administration, and Mr. KIM has put
forth that plan to recognize infrastruc-
ture resiliency as the administration
comes forward.
We are sending a signal to the world
that the U.S. is in denial about the
overwhelming science about climate,
but this bill is a step in the right direc-
tion.
I am very proud of the work the
House Select Committee on the Cli-
mate Crisis and other committees of
jurisdiction are doing. But it is a task
for every committee of the Congress to
look at the jurisdiction of the com-
mittee and to see how, in terms of jobs,
public health, national security, and,
again, our moral responsibility to our
children and future generations—it is
everybody’s responsibility in the Con-
gress. It is a Congress-wide responsi-
bility.
I do thank the House Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis for the
focus that it is placing on all of this.
We will be able to accommodate so
many entrepreneurial ideas, new think-
ing on the subject, being current on the
data and on the science. So we have a
tremendous generational opportunity
and responsibility.
I thank all who are involved in this
for their extraordinary leadership.
Anyone who cares about our planet and
our children’s future is deeply in debt
to those who have taken the lead on
this.
Under President Bush’s leadership
when he was President and we had our
select committee then, we passed the
biggest energy bill in history. While
everyone was not in agreement on the
climate crisis, we all agreed that we
had to take action. President Bush
signed the bill in a big ceremony, and
it was the equivalent of taking tens of
millions of cars off the road in how we
raised the emissions standards. It was
important, and that legislation was the
basis for many of the executive actions
that President Obama was able to take
under the authority of that legislation.
So that was very important, and it
was bipartisan. Hopefully, we can be bi-
partisan as we go forward for the next
big steps that we have to take.
Technology has come a long way
since then. Science informs us better.
Current events have made it very clear:
we have an imperative to have climate
action now.
Again, Mr. Chairman, I urge our col-
leagues to vote for Mr. KIM’s amend-
ment to H.R. 9.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time to close.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ENGEL).
b 0930
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for yielding. On behalf of
both the Foreign Affairs Committee
and the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, we support this amendment. It
is a good amendment.
I also thank the gentleman for work-
ing with the committees on this
amendment.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chair, I reiterate that
my amendment is straightforward. It
recognizes the importance of safe-
guarding our communities and updat-
ing infrastructure to protect against
the adverse impacts of climate change.
We can see that storms are getting
worse and worse and costlier. The
storms are not hitting just red States
or blue States. They are hitting all of
us.
I urge all my colleagues to stand be-
hind my amendment and lend your sup-
port to ensure that our communities
are resilient after the next big storm so
that they can remain a place for people
to raise a family, create jobs, and
achieve the American Dream.
Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, it is,
again, great to be here this morning. I
appreciate Speaker PELOSI coming
down and talking about bipartisan so-
lutions and working together.
Obviously, on this piece of legisla-
tion, I think the terminology was de-
manding a plan for the administration.
Well, that assumes that the adminis-
tration would sign this bill. That also
assumes that the Senate would pass
this bill. Even if the President would
sign a bill that he doesn’t want to
enact, he would probably then veto the
bill he just signed. Then we would sus-
tain his veto.
If we want to move forward, then we
want to do things that can get through

the Senate and get to the President’s
desk. That is why, all afternoon yester-
day, we talked about—and this amend-
ment has some of those issues in it—
adaptation, resiliency, grid moderniza-
tion, and how do you adapt.
We appreciate the intent on which
this amendment is being brought for-
ward.
On another cautionary note, in the
Paris accord, when it talks about ad-
dressing loss and damage associated
with the impacts of climate change, it
is referring to the Paris accord’s provi-
sion for developing countries. That ac-
cord doesn’t have provisions for devel-
oped countries.
Maybe as things move forward with
my colleague from New Jersey, we can
make sure we address that appro-
priately.
We would like to have these studies
done before we go into international
agreements when we don’t know how
they are going to respond, versus after
the fact, just like the cart before the
horse. Then we will know that this is a
good deal, that we should do this, or
maybe that we shouldn’t.
We had a couple of amendments last
night that talked about all the bad as-
pects but none of the positive aspects.
We also had a couple that said let’s
look at the good and the bad.
I would suggest that, in an amend-
ment, there may be some areas of the
country in which the infrastructure is
not going to be harmed. In fact, an
area of the country might even benefit
from these changes.
Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to
vote against the amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 22 OFFERED BY MRS. FLETCHER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 22 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk, and I ask
for its consideration.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 8, after line 20, insert the following
new subsection:
(d) TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL.—Nothing in this
Act may be construed to require or prohibit
the inclusion of a specific energy technology
or technologies in the plan required by this
section.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentlewoman
from Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself 4 minutes, and I rise in support
of my amendment.
Innovation drives the energy indus-
try, and it is important that we con-
tinue to follow a technology-neutral
approach that allows the best science
to flourish and the best technologies to
emerge.
When it comes to energy innovation,
my home in Houston is its home. Hous-
ton, long known as the energy capital
of the world, is the epicenter of our
modern energy renaissance. Home to
virtually every segment of the energy
industry, including exploration, pro-
duction, transmission, marketing, sup-
ply, and technology, we see opportuni-
ties for innovation in all sectors of the
energy industry.
Over the last decade in particular,
energy technology has enabled us to re-
cover resources in new areas and new
ways. Advances in technology that
have transformed our energy economy
have substantially reduced U.S. carbon
emissions.
Replacing coal-fired plants with nat-
ural gas plants has led to the greatest
reduction in carbon emissions in the
last 30 years, and we are leading the
way on new technologies critical to
reaching our emissions reduction goals
and combating climate change, like
carbon capture technologies. Two
plants are near my district in Houston.
We believe in an all-of-the-above ap-
proach to energy sources that reduces
costs as well as emissions, and we see
that in Texas’ investment in wind en-
ergy.
In Texas, we have installed more
wind power generation than any State,
three times as much as the next lead-
ing State.
Houston is home to more than 100
solar-related companies.
These statistics may surprise some,
but they should not because energy
companies, whether renewable or hy-
drocarbon-based, are really technology
companies that apply their technology
to energy.
My amendment ensures that nothing
in this act will favor one fuel source or
one technology over another.
Climate change is a global threat. We
need the input of a diverse and broad
coalition of stakeholders that have the
energy expertise we need to chart our
path forward, and we need to encourage
innovation and technology in every
area.
Mr. Chair, it is for these reasons that
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time to close.
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Chair, I yield
30 seconds to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ENGEL).
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman from Texas for yielding
to me.
On behalf of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee and the Energy and Commerce
Committee, we support this amend-
ment. It is a good amendment, and I
thank the gentlewoman for working
with the committees on the amend-
ment.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time to close.
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Chair, I urge
support for my amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, this is the
perfect example of an amendment that,
as we move something forward that
might be able to be considered by the
Senate and signed by the President, I
think we would be very interested in
dealing with.
Although, I guess I am a little con-
fused. The amendment says we don’t
want to be technologically specific, al-
though you mentioned the benefits of
carbon capture, sequestration, and uti-
lization, which is an amendment we
had in the committee to try to say
these are some good technologies we
ought to consider.
A lot of folks on our side have been
excited about the energy renaissance,
the ability to recover more oil. We
know the great stories of Texas and the
ability to capture carbon and sequester
it with utilization for money to help
deal with other issues.
I think when we move in the direc-
tion of a bill that we plan to get
through the Senate and the House, we
should keep our communications open
because I think there are some bipar-
tisan solutions.
The Republicans have always talked
about conservation, innovation, and
adaptation. This is part of the innova-
tion package.
We also have advanced nuclear in
that package. We also have pump stor-
age and batteries in that package. I
think there are opportunities here.
We offered, as I said, in the com-
mittee, the value of nuclear and ad-
vanced nuclear energy, hydropower,
carbon capture, and the production and
export of natural gas. Part of my port-
folio of volunteer activities is in the
Eastern European bloc. Obviously, the
ability to export natural gas has been a
boon to these countries that don’t want
to be enslaved to Russian natural gas.
Again, there are things we can do.
When we talk about innovation nec-
essary to produce a strong economy,
energy security, and lower emissions,
we have to focus on the benefits of
these technologies. While I can agree
with the idea of this amendment, I
think it falls short of what is necessary
for Congress to assist our priorities.
Mr. Chair, I encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote,
but I look forward to working with my
colleague in the future, and I yield
back the balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 23 OFFERED BY MS. PRESSLEY
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 23 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 5, after line 19, insert the following
paragraph:
(3) The Paris Agreement specifies the need
for a strong global response to climate
change and when taking action, the need to
respect, promote, and safeguard the right to
health now and for future generations.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentlewoman
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I rise to
offer an amendment to H.R. 9, the Cli-
mate Action Now Act.
My amendment is a commonsense
amendment that reaffirms the inter-
connection between climate change
and public health disparities plaguing
communities across our country and
throughout the globe.
Mr. Chair, despite arguments to the
contrary by many, there is no such
thing as planet B. This is the only
Earth we have, and we need to act like
it. H.R. 9 will ensure that this adminis-
tration acts accordingly.
It has been said that politicians con-
sider future elections while statesmen
and -women consider future genera-
tions. It is our responsibility to con-
sider future generations, to take the
necessary actions to reestablish our
Nation as a leader in the global fight to
combat climate change.
The impacts of climate change are
not some futuristic threat. The threats
are imminent; we are being confronted
by them daily; and we must act now.
Climate scientists have made clear
that, if we are to continue down this
path without action, it will be too late.
We must act now. We must act today.
We must act at this very moment.
Climate change and global warming
are threatening all aspects of our soci-
ety and increasing the risk to human
lives and health today, particularly for
vulnerable communities like Roxbury
and Chelsea in my district. These com-
munities are finding themselves on the
front lines of the crisis.
For example, in Boston’s Chinatown
neighborhood, a predominantly immi-
grant and low-income community that
falls at the crossroads of two major
highways, my constituents breathe
some of the most toxic air in all of Bos-
ton, air polluted with car exhaust and
other irritants that are exacerbated by
rising heat levels.
While these are largely invisible pol-
lutants, the impacts are crystal clear.
Over the last several years, asthma
rates at the Josiah Quincy Elementary
School in the heart of Chinatown have
jumped from 18 to 25 percent.
Mr. Chair, let me make this plain.
Our children are breathing toxic air.
These climate injustices are far-
reaching. According to a report re-
leased earlier this week by the Amer-
ican Lung Association, more than 141
million people in the U.S. live in com-
munities with unhealthy levels of toxic
pollution, including many living in my
home State of Massachusetts where air
quality has worsened each year.
The World Health Organization esti-
mates that 7 million people around the
world die each year as a result of these
types of air pollution exposures. These
toxic pollutants are affecting 9 out of
10 people, the vast majority of the
world’s population.
These statistics are staggering and,
quite frankly, terrifying. If it seems
that we are being fatalists, it is be-
cause the threat is a fatal one.
Again, my amendment recognizes the
critical impact that climate change
poses to our fundamental right to
breathe clean air, to drink clean water,
and to live in clean and safe commu-
nities.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I yield 30
seconds to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ENGEL).
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding to me. Let
me say, with pleasure, on behalf of the
Foreign Affairs Committee and also
the Energy and Commerce Committee,
we support this amendment. It is a
good amendment, and I thank the gen-
tlewoman for working with the com-
mittees on this amendment.

Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, first of
all, we really don’t need a Paris Agree-
ment to meet substantial changes in
the carbon dioxide, or, as my colleague
was speaking, she was really referring
to the Clean Air Act and the four cri-
teria pollutants that we have so ag-
gressively addressed since 1992.
Having said that, what is better for
the poor and the downtrodden is to
have a job. What is better for their
health and economic opportunity is to
have a job. What also helps is that they
have a good paying job that provides
great healthcare benefits.
So, from 2015 to 2018, out of the in-
dustrialized countries, the United
States is the number one reducer of
carbon dioxide—number one. We didn’t
have to do it with all these inter-
national accords. We do it through in-
novation, technology, and advance-
ment.
But carbon dioxide emissions went up
last year. That is a known fact. The
question is why. Well, Mr. Chairman,
we have one of the best economies that
I have ever served in in the House of
Representatives, where there are help
wanted signs all over the place.
As the manufacturing sector grows,
there is a need to address these emis-
sions. That is why Republicans con-
tinue to look forward to the day when
we can join with our Democratic col-
leagues on conservation, innovation,
and adaptation, moving some bills and
processes through the floor that will be
received well in the Senate and to the
President’s desk.
I think, rather than focus on the
finding, we should debate bipartisan so-
lutions such as boosting research, ad-
vanced technologies, and promoting in-
novation. I ask my colleagues to vote
‘‘no’’ on this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.
PRESSLEY).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 24 OFFERED BY MS. SCHRIER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 24 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 8, after line 20, insert the following
new subsection:
(d) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in
this section may be construed to require or
prohibit the President from including or con-
sidering voluntary agricultural practices to
be undertaken by farmers and ranchers,
thereby contributing to the development of
soil organic matter, increasing carbon se-
questration, reducing greenhouse gas emis-
sions, and contributing to meeting the goals
and ambitions of the Paris Agreement.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentlewoman
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington.
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
My amendment would support farm-
ers and ranchers who employ agricul-
tural practices that help us meet the
goals and ambitions of the Paris Agree-
ment.
In order to combat climate change,
we are all going to have to work to-
gether. Ours is a country that has al-
ready banded together to take on the
greatest challenges of our times, and
this is no exception. This is a time for
the United States to not just partner,
but to lead the world in protecting this
planet for our children and future gen-
erations.
Now, farmers and ranchers are on the
front line of the climate crisis, and
they are stepping up. Droughts, fires,

and floods are threatening their safety
and their livelihoods. My time on the
Agriculture Committee and time spent
with growers in my district have shown
me that farmers are deeply invested in
addressing our climate and are eager to
be part of the solution.
Farmers are already expanding no-
till practices, rotating crops, and
planting cover crops to sequester car-
bon, fix nitrogen and other soil nutri-
ents, and reduce erosion. With that
healthier soil packed with organic
matter, they are decreasing their reli-
ance on fossil fuel-based fertilizers, in-
creasing yields, saving water, and re-
ducing greenhouse gas emissions.
We must recognize and celebrate the
contributions of our farmers who en-
gage in sustainable ag practices. My
amendment would support this agricul-
tural ingenuity and creativity and pre-
vent this administration from standing
in the way of farmers and ranchers who
are fighting climate change.
The climate crisis is an urgent mat-
ter, and there isn’t one silver bullet.
Let’s recognize that the solution will
require something from all of us and
support our farmers who can make a
tremendous dent in CO2 emissions.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
30 seconds to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ENGEL).
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding to me.
Let me say with pleasure, on behalf
of the Foreign Affairs Committee and
also the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, I support this amendment. It is
a good amendment, and I want to
thank the gentlewoman for working
with the committee on this amend-
ment.
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chairman, I would
just like to reiterate that it is so im-
portant that we all step up.
When I hear my colleagues talking
about jobs, needing to do other things,
waiting, this is too advanced. It is frus-
trating to see that 2 years passed and
we saw absolutely no legislation to
protect our climate. Kicking the can
down the road further just puts our fu-
ture in peril, along with the future of
our children.
So I would ask for that step of faith
that we will protect jobs. I am happy
to say that H.R. 9 specifically notes
that, in addressing our changing cli-
mate, this will create jobs, clean en-
ergy jobs, and you can rest assured
that our economy will flourish with ad-
dressing our climate.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, again,
to my colleague, and I appreciate it.
She has me at a disadvantage because
I have a huge ag district, 33 counties in
southern Illinois, more pigs than peo-
ple. I have corn, beans, and the like, so
we appreciate this; and we appreciate
this amendment because of the vol-
untary action of it and trying to
incentivize and appreciate what our ag-
riculture community has done because,
as you know, other proposals out there
that are debated in Washington might
have some severe effects on agri-
culture.
I also want to take this time to say
we did a lot in the last Congress. I
think the misnomer is that if we don’t
say ‘‘climate change’’ and we move
good public policy, that we haven’t
done anything.
Through the House, we passed:
The Energy Efficient Government
Technology Act; that was actually
voice voted and sponsored by ANNA
ESHOO from California;
Advanced Nuclear Technology Devel-
opment Act, BOB LATTA from Ohio;
Streamlining Energy Efficiency for
Schools Act, which this is another
thing we did in the last Congress;
Ozone Standards Implementation Act
of 2017, PETE OLSON from Texas;
Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving
the Environment, the SENSE Act;
Blocking Regulatory Interference
from Closing Kilns Act by BILL JOHN-
SON;
Responsible Disposal Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2017, another bill to reau-
thorize the West Valley Act.
Of course, I am a proud sponsor, with
a huge bipartisan vote, for what was
H.R. 3053, which was how do you deal
with the nuclear waste provision.
So we actually moved a lot of bills in
the last Congress, and many of those
bills were in a bipartisan manner.
Yes, we do not carry the mantle of
‘‘Paris’’ or ‘‘climate,’’ but not every-
thing has to be a subtitle of that major
provision, especially if you are doing
what we are trying to do in the House,
which is bring to the floor bills in a bi-
partisan manner.
Conservation, that would be like en-
ergy efficiency, new source review, for-
est management practices. Being from
Washington State, the gentlewoman
understands the forest issues and the
concerns that we do more forest man-
agement practices. Maybe some of our
fires would be less so.
Innovation; advanced nuclear power;
carbon capture; utilization; sequestra-
tion, which we spoke about in an
amendment previously; and also pump
storage batteries.
Also, from Washington State, the
gentlewoman knows the benefits of hy-
dropower, and if we can pump that
water back up and have a continuous
cycle, that is a pretty green use of
power.
Adaptation, grid modernization, re-
siliency, and things on GMO crops,
crops that can change if the environ-
ment is changing, if the growing cycles
change. Right now we have drought-re-
sistant corn. We might have to have
corn that grows in wetter conditions.
That is all part of the adaptation that
we need to talk about.
So I appreciate the gentlewoman’s
amendment and the chance to discuss
these issues. I support voluntary ac-
tion. The idea of this amendment will
be better served focusing on examining
the costs of these commitments, like
some of our Republican amendments
try to do, as we move this bill outside
of the committee.
I oppose this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

climate change. Eighty percent of par-
ents and 86 percent of teachers believe
that schools should teach about cli-
mate change and its impacts on our en-
vironment, our economy, and our soci-
ety.
As our future generations grow up in
a world that is impacted by extreme
weather events and a changing climate,
it is essential that we educate them on
the causes and impacts of the crisis, as
well as equip them for finding solutions
to combat it.
Climate change truly is an existen-
tial threat, in my view, that we must
begin tackling head-on. Science is per-
fectly clear that we have a very short
runway to avoid catastrophic con-
sequences for our planet, and this mo-
ment requires bold action now. The so-
lutions we find and the bold policies
that our country requires to combat
this current crisis must begin with
education.
While it is our duty to get the ball
rolling on policies and programs that
will begin to mitigate climate change-
related issues, make no mistake: It is
our children who will feel the brunt of
the effects that our scientific commu-
nity has outlined time and time again.
When my daughter, Natalie, who is
now 8 months old, is attending middle
school, climate change and its impacts
on our planet will be her reality. She
should be equipped with every resource
we are able to offer her at that time,
and that begins with education.
This amendment underscores the im-
portance of State and local efforts to
teach our youth the causes and effects
of climate change. Again, the science is
clear, and it is of the utmost impor-
tance that the next generation is pre-
sented with the facts of this crisis.

Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I yield 30
seconds to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. ENGEL), the distinguished
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I want
to, first of all, thank the gentleman for
yielding and say unequivocally, on be-
half of the Foreign Affairs Committee
and the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, we, both committees, support
this very good amendment. I also want
to thank the gentleman for working
with the committees on this amend-
ment.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chairman, I again
thank the chairman for his distin-
guished leadership in chairing the For-
eign Affairs full committee and for his
leadership in shepherding this impor-
tant resolution to the floor.
Mr. Chairman, I would hope that my
colleagues across the aisle could come
to consensus on this amendment. I
think it is a commonsense, reasonable
amendment that ensures that our chil-
dren, the next generation, are, as I
said, well-informed about the causes
and the effects of climate change so
that they can work with all of us to try
to stop it and to try to deal with the
planetary crisis that we find ourselves
in.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I appre-
ciate my colleague bringing that up. I
taught high school for 4 years, so edu-
cation is key.
This whole provision of moving to
the Paris accord was done without edu-
cation of the Members of Congress. It
was an executive branch decision.
We can debate whether the President
had the authority or didn’t have the
authority, but we think what happened
was that there was not total buy-in.
Had it been presented as an agreement
or had it been presented as a treaty, it
wouldn’t have passed either Chamber.
I do agree that education is very,
very important. However, I also believe
in local control. Republicans will al-
ways have a challenge with the Federal
Government directing, dictating, and
telling our local schools what their
curriculum should be.
Mr. Chair, that is why I oppose this
amendment. I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 26 OFFERED BY MR. VAN DREW
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 26 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 6, after line 23, insert the following
new paragraphs (and redesignate the subse-
quent paragraph accordingly):
(8) Article 8 of the Paris Agreement notes
Parties recognize the importance of avert-
ing, minimizing and addressing loss and
damage associated with the adverse effects
of climate change, including extreme weath-
er events and slow onset events, and the role
of sustainable development in reducing the
risk of loss and damage such as strong winds
from hurricanes and tropical storms, and
flooding from storm surges and heavy rain,
that inflict losses on various sectors of the
United States economy.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Chair, my
amendment would add to the findings
of the importance of averting, mini-
mizing, and addressing loss and damage
associated with the adverse effects of
climate change, including extreme
weather events.
It is well known that extreme weath-
er events, such as hurricanes and trop-
ical storms, are some of the most dev-
astating and costly consequences of a
warming world, displacing thousands of
people at a time and costing govern-
ment billions of dollars to recover.
The good people of south Jersey
know that climate change is occurring
because our streets flood almost every
time it rains in the coastal areas. Un-
fortunately, we also have the painful
reminder of Superstorm Sandy.
On October 29, 2012, Superstorm
Sandy first struck the mainland near
Brigantine, New Jersey, in my district,
pounding our coast with winds of over
70 miles per hour and 13-foot storm
surges, ultimately killing 147 people.
Superstorm Sandy was the most de-
structive natural disaster ever to
strike the State of New Jersey and
ranks among the five costliest natural
disasters in our Nation’s history.
Here is some of the damage caused by
Sandy: Almost 350,000 homes were dam-
aged. 1,400 vessels were sunk or aban-
doned. Seventy drinking water systems
were affected. Eighty wastewater
treatment plants suffered power loss or
damage. The entire coastline experi-
enced erosion. And untold billions were
sucked out of our economy.
We need to recognize that climate
change is exacerbating the intensity
and the frequency of extreme weather
events that often cause the loss of life,
property, and security.
Staying in the Paris Agreement is
good for jobs and good for the econ-
omy.
Investing in clean, low-carbon tech-
nologies will help us expand and de-
velop the industries of the future and
help us compete globally against other
countries that are already making sig-
nificant investments in these fields.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support my amendment, which simply
acknowledges the need to reduce and
avoid the human and economic toll
brought on by the changing climate
and that we need to develop our econ-
omy in a sustainable fashion.
Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL).
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for yielding and say, on be-
half of the Foreign Affairs Committee
and the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, we support this amendment.
New York, which is just up from New
Jersey, also suffered tremendously
from Superstorm Sandy. In fact, a lot
of the repairs that we are doing now to
the New York City subway are a direct
result of that, so I certainly appreciate
the gentleman’s words and concern.
This is a good amendment, and I
thank the gentleman for working with
the committees on this amendment.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3417
May 2, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, we appre-
ciate this amendment. A lot of these
amendments are putting the cart be-
fore the horse. It would have been in-
teresting to have these debates about
resiliency and efficiencies prior to the
administration going into the Paris ac-
cord. You do the research first and
then you make a decision.
Now what we are trying to do is say,
okay, we have this Paris accord that
the President has stepped away from,
so now let’s evaluate what impacts are
happening.
We did accept an amendment yester-
day in this debate to look at both posi-
tive and negative aspects, which I
think is a fair balance. There are going
to be some areas of the country that
are going to benefit; there are going to
be some areas of the country that are
going to be disadvantaged. So I think
that is helpful in this debate.
There is a lot of talk about an infra-
structure bill coming up. We hope that
would be something we would move in
a bipartisan manner. I know that it is
always going to be asked how to pay
for it.
I am willing to make the tough calls
on how to pay for it. But in that infra-
structure bill, it would be great if the
resiliency of communities and these
concerns that are being addressed
could be wrapped up in something like
that.
Again, for this bill, Leader MCCON-
NELL just said on the floor that they
are not going to address it. Even if
they did, the President wouldn’t sign
it.
We will get to a point in time in this
Congress when we will work together.
Republicans believe in conservation,
innovation, and adaptation. This is
part of the adaptation portfolio, and we
look forward to working with you as
we move forward.
This amendment does nothing to af-
fect CO2 reductions, so I will oppose the
amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. VAN
DREW).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from New Jersey will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 27 OFFERED BY MR. LEVIN OF
CALIFORNIA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 27 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 7, after line 5, insert the following
new paragraph:
(9) The Paris Agreement has driven innova-
tion in developing cleaner, more reliable,
and more affordable forms of energy, dem-
onstrating that addressing climate change
and providing affordable energy to American
consumers are not mutually exclusive. The
Paris Agreement encouraged the United
States to develop a Mid-Century Strategy for
Deep Decarbonization, which was submitted
on November 16, 2016. The Mid-Century
Strategy for Deep Decarbonization stated
that ‘‘energy efficiency improvements enable
the energy system to provide the services we
need with fewer resources and emissions.
Over the past several years, the United
States has demonstrated that programs and
standards to improve the energy efficiency
of buildings, appliances and vehicles can
cost-effectively cut carbon pollution and
lower energy bills, while maintaining signifi-
cant support from U.S. industry and con-
sumers.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from California (Mr. LEVIN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Chair, I
rise today to mark a monumental occa-
sion for this body and offer an amend-
ment to H.R. 9, the Climate Action
Now Act.
After years of denial, outright lies,
and inaction on the climate crisis
under Republican leadership in the
House, we are finally taking meaning-
ful steps to protect our planet for fu-
ture generations.
While the President denies climate
change exists, promotes fake scientists
who believe pollution is good, and pulls
us backward, we are embracing the sci-
entific consensus that climate change
is real; it is driven by human action;
and it is already having a detrimental
impact on our health and our planet.
There are a lot of myths about cli-
mate change that we must dispel. One
of the biggest myths I hear is that we
cannot combat climate change, invest
in clean energy, and grow our economy
at the same time. We know that isn’t
true.
In California, we have seen strong
GDP and per capita income growth
while also leading the country in the
fight to combat the climate crisis.
We also know that renewable energy
options are often more affordable for
consumers than traditional fossil fuels.
That is why my amendment to the Cli-
mate Action Now Act adds three key
facts about our ability to reduce green-
house gas emissions and maintain af-
fordable energy options at the same
time.
First, the greenhouse gas emissions
reductions spurred by the Paris Agree-
ment have driven innovation for reli-
able and affordable forms of energy,
which demonstrates that emissions re-
ductions and affordable energy are not
mutually exclusive.
Second, the United States’ long-term
greenhouse gas emissions reduction
strategy under the Paris Agreement
touted energy efficiency improvements
in buildings, appliances, and vehicles
as a way to cost-effectively reduce
emissions and lower energy bills.
Third, this strategy has had the sup-
port of both industry and consumers.
This amendment is very simple. It
should not be controversial. Members
of both parties should be able to agree
that we can reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, invest in clean energy alter-
natives, and maintain affordable en-
ergy options at the same time.
Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to recognize this simple fact
and support my amendment to H.R. 9.
Ultimately, this is about the planet
we leave behind for our children and
our grandchildren. With a 5- and 6-
year-old at home, I am proud to co-
sponsor the Climate Action Now Act
and support bold and commonsense so-
lutions to the climate crisis.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Chair, I
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from
New York (Mr. ENGEL), the distin-
guished chair of the Foreign Affairs
Committee.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for yielding to me and want
to gladly say, on behalf of the Foreign
Affairs Committee and also the Energy
and Commerce Committee, we support
this amendment.
It is a very good amendment, an im-
portant amendment. I thank the gen-
tleman for working with the commit-
tees on this amendment.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS).
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Chair, I thank
Mr. LEVIN for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Rep-
resentative LEVIN’s amendment and
H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act.
I know when you think of Minnesota,
the first thing you think of is snow. It
is true that we know how to handle a
snowy winter. But this year, the Mid-
west was hit with record levels of
snowfall, and when all that snow melt-
ed, it led to record levels of flooding.
Farms and homes across the entire
region have been devastated, and it is
because of climate change, one of the
greatest threats of our time.
We must lead, and we must be on the
right side of history, so I cannot under-
stand why the President pulled us out
of the Paris climate agreement.
I support H.R. 9 to recommit us to
this agreement because we should be
running toward sustainable solutions,
not away from them.
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3418 May 2, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, again, first
of all, I appreciate my colleague, one
whom I have gotten a chance to know.
I look forward to working with him on
some issues down the road.
I want to take this time to kind of
reject the premise that nothing has
been done. In the debate a little while
ago, I mentioned the 15 or 20 bills that
had passed the House in a bipartisan
manner. These were signed into law, a
lot of the hydroelectric extensions in
H.R. 2122 and H.R. 2292 to extend the
project of the Federal Energy Regu-
latory Commission involving the
Cannonsville dam. Hydroelectric power
is clean, renewable. I can go through a
whole list of things that were done.
As I said in debate earlier, just be-
cause we don’t put the stamp of
‘‘Paris’’ or ‘‘climate change’’ on a piece
of legislation doesn’t mean that it is
not going to help reduce our carbon ex-
posure. In fact, our country has the
largest reduction of CO2 of any indus-
trialized nation from 2015 to 2018.
Having said that, I also would readily
admit, and the Chair has heard me say
this many times, that in 2019, our emis-
sions went up. But that was because we
have a thriving economy with more
manufacturing. So this debate is still
very important.
This amendment suggests that the
measures that the Obama administra-
tion were putting in place to meet the
commitments in the Paris Agreement
were affordable. A lot of us would re-
ject that premise when you look at the
cost per kilowatt hour of major genera-
tion, baseload versus the green.
We have always tried to be kind of an
all-of-the-above. Actually, in part of
my congressional district, which is
very large, I have one of the biggest
wind farms in Illinois. That is in the
Champaign County, Vermilion County,
Ford County area in southern Illinois.
b 1015
Also, solar power. Because of the ac-
tions our State General Assembly has
done, we have a lot of solar power con-
struction going on in the State of Illi-
nois. An all-of-the-above approach is
what we would hope for.
We look forward to the time when
this, too, shall pass, this debate on this
bill, which will then go to the Senate
and die, and then we work back with
my friends in the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. Chairman ENGEL is also on the
Energy and Commerce Committee, so
he knows that we will eventually get
to the aspect where we can move in a
bipartisan manner.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LEVIN).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 28 OFFERED BY MR. CROW
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 28 printed
in House Report 116–42.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 7, after line 5, insert the following:
(9) In its nationally determined contribu-
tion, the United States notes that pursuant
to Executive Order 13693 (2015), the Federal
Government has committed to reduce emis-
sions 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, and
reaffirmed the Department of Defense’s goal
to procure renewable energy across military
installations and operations ‘‘to drive na-
tional greenhouse gas reductions and support
preparations for the impacts of climate
change’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. CROW) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today to high-
light the continuing work at the De-
partment of Defense to procure renew-
able energy, reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, and make our military more
resilient in the face of climate change.
The American military is the strong-
est in the world. It is also the world’s
biggest consumer of energy. In 2017,
our Armed Forces consumed over 85
million barrels of fuel to power ships,
aircraft, combat vehicles, and bases. As
a combat veteran, I know firsthand
that our reliance on fossil fuels at
home and on the battlefield makes us
very vulnerable.
Moreover, current and former DOD
civilian and military leaders have ar-
gued that climate change presents a
rising threat to our force readiness and
has exposed vulnerabilities of critical
operations. They have argued that cli-
mate change is an urgent national se-
curity threat, and I agree.
Warming oceans lead to higher tides,
putting our Nation’s critical infra-
structure at risk. Severe weather has
already wrought havoc on military as-
sets, including Tyndall Air Force Base,
which will likely require $5 billion in
repairs after Hurricane Michael. Cli-
mate change is already causing mass
migrations that affect the stability of
nations and will put our national secu-
rity and that of our allies at risk.
The purpose of my amendment is to
make the DOD’s contributions to the
government sustainability efforts a
part of the conversation surrounding
H.R. 9. And the DOD’s accomplish-
ments should be lauded: the DOD has
invested heavily in microgrids, renew-
able energy resources, and fuel-effi-
cient vehicles.
Additionally, last year’s NDAA re-
quired the military to build on its obli-
gations to address climate change by
incorporating energy and climate resil-
iency efforts into its installation and
operational planning.
The DOD has done a lot so far and is
a model for the rest of the U.S. Govern-
ment, but there is more to be done.
Going forward, we have a unique op-
portunity to support sustainable poli-
cies, while also securing our bases, sav-
ing taxpayer money, and protecting
the environment. One of the best exam-
ples is Fort Hood, Texas. Fort Hood has
invested in technology to harness re-
newable energy and ensure that power
is being efficiently managed. It is esti-
mated that the combination of
microgrids and renewable energy will
save Fort Hood $100 million in energy
costs. It is also hardened against po-
tential vulnerabilities in the electrical
grid, which is a win for our security.
We must scale smart, practical solu-
tions, like those at the DOD, to make
our force more resilient, agile, and effi-
cient.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support my amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
ENGEL), the chairman.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I am happy to say
that on behalf of the Foreign Affairs
Committee and the Energy and Com-
merce Committee we support this
amendment. It is a very good amend-
ment. I also thank the gentleman for
working with our committees on this
amendment.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chairman, simply
put, the Federal Government cannot
meet its obligations under the Paris
Agreement without DOD’s past, ongo-
ing, and future contributions to this ef-
fort. I urge my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle to recognize this fact and
support my amendment.
This is very simple. This is an oppor-
tunity for a win-win-win, which is
often hard to come by these days, but
this is good for the American tax-
payers. It will save us hundreds of mil-
lions, if not billions, of dollars by pro-
moting these efforts and increasing en-
ergy resiliency and efficiency. It is a
win for our national security, because
it is one of our largest vulnerabilities.
Our bases are subject to cyberattack
and are very vulnerable to continuity
decreases in our operations. And it is a
win for the environment.
This is something that we have to do
and that we have an obligation to do in
support of our national security.
Mr. Chairman, again, I urge everyone
to join in supporting this amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I want
to make sure I also thank my colleague
for his service. I, too, served in the
Army infantry during the Cold War.
They are a band of brothers, and we do
appreciate his service to the country.
Also, I do appreciate that the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act,
passed in the last Congress, has been
helpful. That is another example of, it

wasn’t couched in climate change, but
it was couched in national defense.
That is where, again, I will continue to
make the arguments and the comments
that things have been going on. I don’t
want to read the first list of bills and
stuff that we have passed over the last
Congress.
The military is also looking at small
modular nuclear reactors in some iso-
lated locations. That will be part of the
issues in the innovation area that Re-
publicans could be very, very sup-
portive of. We look forward to having
those debates.
I also know forward operating bases
of solar technology and of solar power
help keep our warfighters prepared and
able to communicate. It is just the
smart thing to do versus trying to haul
crude oil or generators and stuff to
places where it would not be in the best
interest of our warfighters to have.
So the focus is good. The Repub-
licans, again, believe in conservation,
innovation, and adaptation. When we
move a bill that will get a chance to be
heard by the Senate and that we work
together, the goal would be to get
something on the President’s desk that
he will sign. This is not the venue, be-
cause the Senate is not going to move
it and the President is not going to
sign it. But I would encourage my col-
leagues to stay engaged, not just with
the Armed Services Committee, but
the Energy and Commerce Committee,
and colleagues on this side because I do
think there is merit to the debate. Ac-
knowledgement of what the Depart-
ment of Defense has done was focused
on by the previous Commander in
Chief.
The Paris climate mandates insti-
tuted by the Obama administration
through the Paris Agreement and the
outdated executive order would have
increased energy prices and wasted tax-
payer dollars. As a result, we cannot
support the amendment that would
condone and reinstitute some of these
costly measures.
Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to
vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, as the

ally determined contribution under the Paris
Agreement, and the failure to meet such con-
tribution, including but not limited to—

(B) the cost of energy, such as electricity
and gasoline, for consumers; and
(C) the ability to develop and deploy new,

nologies.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I want to
say very strongly that on behalf of the
Foreign Affairs Committee and also
the Energy and Commerce Committee,
we support this amendment. It is a
very good amendment.
The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015,
is the first truly universal agreement
among nations to tackle climate
change. Rarely is there consensus
among nearly all nations on a single
topic. But with the Paris Agreement,
leaders from around the world collec-
tively agreed that climate change is
driven by human behavior, that it is a
threat to the environment and all of
humanity, and that global action is
needed to stop it.
It also created a clear framework for
all countries to make emission reduc-
tion commitments. At present, 197
countries—every nation on Earth, with
the last signatory being war-torn
Syria—have adopted the Paris Agree-
ment. This agreement includes a series
of mandatory measures for the moni-
toring, verification, and public report-
ing of progress towards a country’s
emission reduction targets.
The emission reduction targets them-
selves are voluntary. Each nation sets
their own, respectful of national sov-
ereignty, and there is no penalty for
missing the targets. The idea is to cre-
ate a culture of accountability and
maybe some peer pressure to get coun-
tries to reduce emissions.
Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. COX), the
author of this amendment.
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Chairman,
I am honored to be here today to intro-
duce my amendment to H.R. 9, the Cli-
mate Action Now Act. My amendment
takes into consideration the various
populations, regions, industries and
communities affected by climate
change, while reducing any possible
impacts on American jobs.
We all know that climate change has
impacted countries and communities
throughout our country and the world.
Over the past few years, we have seen
the devastating effects of it on the
waters of the Caribbean Sea, fueling
powerful storms, like Hurricane Maria,
which devastated Puerto Rico and took
the lives of close to 3,000 people and
displacing another 300,000 from their
homes.
In my home State of California last
year, it led to the deadliest wildfire
season in history. According to the Na-
tional Climate Assessment, rural com-
munities, like the ones I serve, face
challenging obstacles in responding to
climate change because they are so
highly dependent on natural resources.
My constituents, the people of Cali-
fornia’s Central Valley, live in one of
the most economically distressed parts
of our country. We have been forgotten
and left behind. But it is my constitu-
ents who have seen the direct impacts
of climate change with our recent heat
waves and droughts. It is only going to
get worse if we don’t work together
and address this issue head-on.
H.R. 9 is the first step we must take
in addressing this challenge. This
would prohibit Federal funds from
being used to take any action in ad-
vancing the withdrawal of the U.S.
from the Paris Agreement.
The U.S. committed to joining the
Paris Agreement because we are a lead-
ing nation. It is unfortunate that this
President is taking us backward.
b 1030
Instead of fighting climate change,
the President and his administration
have proposed to slash funding from
the Department of Energy’s Efficiency
and Renewable Energy offices by over
85 percent, and they even propose to
cut energy funding from our States.
My amendment would help create a
clean energy economy that would pro-
vide good paying jobs to millions of
Americans, cleaner air for everyone,
and a safe, sustainable future for our
children and grandchildren.
What we continue to hear from our
Republican colleagues is that a number
of coal jobs will be taken away from
Americans. And I can tell you, as
somebody who has worked in the min-
ing industry, who has worked under-
ground, I know it is not the way to go.
While we know that mining jobs and
underground jobs are honorable jobs
and provide for families, at one time so
was whaling, but we need to be innova-
tive in looking towards the future. The
more time we waste on clinging to jobs
of the past, the more time we waste on
not making progress.
Nationally, there are over 240,000 jobs
in the solar industry alone, and only
about 53,000 coal mining jobs. Reports
find that the Paris Agreement would
generate over 24 million jobs world-
wide.
In the State of California, we have
over 519,000 clean energy jobs, and it is
critical, more than ever, that we con-
tinue to connect workers to these jobs
that we are creating for the 21st cen-
tury. My amendment does just that by
requiring any climate plan to consider
the impact on jobs, wages, and pay.
We have the opportunity to be global
leaders in the clean energy economy,
ensure that so many of these jobs are
created right here in the United
States—not in other countries, not in
India, not in China.
We cannot afford to take steps back
on the fight on climate change, and we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3420 May 2, 2019
must keep our word to the rest of the
world. Mr. Chairman, I urge my col-
leagues to support my amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman from New York has expired.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois has the only time remain-
ing. The time of the gentleman from
New York has expired.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I will
read into the RECORD a statement. This
is from the International Energy Agen-
cy, Global Energy and CO2 Status Re-
port 2018, published March of 2019, so it
is pretty much fresh off the press. It
addresses some of these issues that I
have mentioned during this debate
today about how we have been doing
things; how, overall, missions are de-
creasing; and how public policy has
helped, and the like.
This is on page 10: ‘‘In the United
States, the emission reductions seen in
2017 were reversed with an increase of
3.1 percent in CO2 emissions in 2018.’’
That is what we addressed about the
economy going up, more CO2 emissions.
‘‘Despite this increase, emissions in
the United States remain around their
1990 levels, 14 percent and 800 metric
tons of CO2 below their peak in 2000.
This is the largest absolute decline
among all countries since 2000.’’
So I think that is instructive when
we are here debating a bill that is not
going to be reviewed by the Senate and
the President is not going to sign it.
We look forward to working with my
colleagues on the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce on things that we
can do to work together to even make
better strides than what we already
have in this country.
We don’t get a lot of credit because
we don’t couch it in, as I said before,
Mr. Chairman, ‘‘climate change,’’
‘‘Paris accord.’’
But, you know, facts are important,
data is important, and the Energy In-
formation Agency is an independent
agency underneath the Department of
Commerce, so it is evaluating all coun-
tries and all emissions.
Republicans believe in conservation,
which would be energy efficiency, new
source review, force management, in-
novation, advanced nuclear power, car-
bon capture, sequestration, utilization.
To the colleague who brought the
amendment up, I don’t believe coal will
be dead. I think if we bring technology
and we use carbon capture, utilization,
and sequestration and get it captured,
we can still have a coal mining sector.
We can still have energy electricity
generated by coal. I hope so, because I
am from a coal mining region, and I am
not going to walk away from the jobs
in southern Illinois.
And the adaptation which we have
had a lot of debate about today, which
is grid modernization, resiliency, crops,
and the like.
The amendment of my colleague is
opposite to what Dr. BURGESS and I
tried to do in the committee when we
marked up this bill. We wanted to have
the research and the analysis done be-
fore we go back to a climate agree-
ment.
I mean, what good does it do if you
go to an agreement and then you find
that jobs have been lost, wages have
gone down? It is too late. You are in
the agreement.
So let’s do the research prior, which
was our amendment, Dr. BURGESS and
I—it wasn’t made in order for the
floor——to say let’s do this research.
So if we are going to move and go
back into the climate Paris accord, if
we are going to affect jobs in the econ-
omy negatively, we should know that
beforehand. This amendment does not
do that.
Mr. Chairman, I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote
on this amendment, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from New York will be
postponed.
The Acting CHAIR. The Committee
will rise informally.
The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. PHIL-

AMENDMENT NO. 30 OFFERED BY MR.
KRISHNAMOORTHI
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CASTEN of Il-
linois). It is now in order to consider
amendment No. 30 printed in House Re-
port 116–42.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-
man, I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 6, after line 18, insert the following
paragraph:
(7) Essential in achieving this target is a
thriving clean energy industry in the United
States, which currently employs over 500,000
Americans.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 329, the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of
amendment No. 30 to the Climate Ac-
tion Now Act.
We are already seeing the economic
benefits of taking action on climate
change. In the United States, we have
already created millions—I say mil-
lions—of jobs in the clean economy,
from installing wind turbines and solar
panels, to retrofitting buildings to
make them more energy efficient, to
assembling fuel-efficient vehicles and
manufacturing the component parts for
all of these clean energy technologies
that can help drive down emissions.
My amendment acknowledges the
important role clean energy jobs play
in meeting the United States’ commit-
ment under the Paris Agreement.
There are currently more than 500,000
jobs in the renewable job industry
alone, just an example of the millions
of jobs we are creating in the clean
economy as we work to meet our emis-
sions reductions target.
By taking a leadership role in global
climate action, we can harness these
benefits and see even more economic
growth and opportunities for commu-
nities everywhere, including in south-
ern Illinois. And we need to make sure
we do this in a way that not only cre-
ates jobs, but creates good family-sus-
taining jobs for working families
throughout the country, including in
my home State of Illinois and in the
Eighth District of Illinois.
Economic growth, workforce develop-
ment, and climate leadership go hand
in hand. As cofounder and co-chair of
the bipartisan Congressional Solar
Caucus, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL).
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I thank
my friend for yielding, and I want to
say unequivocally, on behalf of the
Foreign Affairs Committee and the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, we
strongly support this amendment. It is
an excellent amendment. I also want to
thank the gentleman for working with
the committees on this amendment.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank the gentleman from New
York for his excellent remarks.
I have no further comments, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

CORRECTION
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3421
May 2, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from southern Illinois is recognized for
5 minutes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I
think that is the first time I have been
directed to my region of the State of Il-
linois, and I appreciate it.
Illinois has 102 counties. I represent
33 of those, or parts of 33, so it is a lit-
tle different than north of I–80, as the
Chairman knows and as does the au-
thor of this amendment. And, of
course, you had me at a disadvantage
because I have great kinship and
friendship with my colleague who is of-
fering this amendment.
I would pause to say sometimes we
have a hard time defining ‘‘clean.’’
What is clean energy? For me, some
of this debate is no CO2 or very limited
CO2 emissions. I think that is in the
Paris accord, in the climate change,
global warming debate. It is all about
CO2. We have some colleagues come
here and talk about the four criteria
pollutants and stuff, but this is really
about CO2.
So we also think not just solar, but
we ought to make sure we do geo-
thermal provisions. We ought to look
at pump storage provisions. We should
do the hydroelectric provisions.
As my colleagues know, Mr. Chair-
man, the Chicagoland area of Illinois
has the largest production of elec-
tricity through the use of nuclear
power—six locations, 11 reactors. How
much does it emit of CO2 into the at-
mosphere? Zero. Major baseload energy
that is beneficial in this debate, be-
cause we can’t meet these standards
unless we have some major generation,
some major baseload.
So I think if we look forward to mov-
ing forward with a bill that would have
a chance to move to the Senate floor
that we eventually want to get to the
President, we actually look forward to
working with my colleagues on provi-
sions and helping us grapple with the
definition of clean.
If the definition is little to no CO2
emissions, solar is great; wind is great.
They are small parts of a large port-
folio of nuclear energy and hydro-
electric, which are the predominant
clean energy electricity producers if
that definition is CO2.
So, with that, I ask my colleagues to
vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendment, respect-
fully.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr.
KRISHNAMOORTHI).
The amendment was agreed to.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. MCGOVERN)
(during the vote). There is 1 minute re-
maining.
b 1146
Mr. GAETZ changed his vote from
‘‘no’’ to ‘‘aye.’’
So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The Acting CHAIR. There being no
further amendments, under the rule,
the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.
BONAMICI) having assumed the chair,
Mr. MCGOVERN, Acting Chair of the
Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union, reported that that
Committee, having had under consider-
ation the bill (H.R. 9) to direct the
President to develop a plan for the
United States to meet its nationally
determined contribution under the
Paris Agreement, and for other pur-
poses, and, pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 329, he reported the bill back to
the House with sundry amendments
adopted in the Committee of the
Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
Is a separate vote demanded on any
amendment reported from the Com-
mittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair
will put them en gros. The question is
on the amendments.
The amendments were agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I have a
motion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. BARR. I am in its current form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Barr moves to recommit the bill H.R.
9 to the Committee on Foreign Affairs with
instructions to report the same back to the
House forthwith, with the following amend-
ment:
At the end of the bill, add the following
new section:
SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall take effect on the date that
the President certifies that meeting the na-
tionally determined contribution of the
United States under the Paris Agreement
will not result in a net transfer of jobs from
the United States to China.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, this is
the final amendment to the bill. It

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3427
May 2, 2019
would not kill the bill or send it back
to committee. If adopted, the bill
would immediately proceed to final
passage, as amended.
This motion makes a small but im-
portant change to the bill, a change
that is necessary to preserve the eco-
nomic strength of the United States.
The amendment simply states that
the act shall not take effect until the
President certifies that the United
States will not, on net, lose jobs to
China as a result of meeting the emis-
sions commitments required under the
Paris Agreement.
If, as the majority believes, the Paris
Agreement will improve America’s eco-
nomic and technological competitive-
ness, this should not be a problem.
Madam Speaker, I do not disagree
with my colleagues that climate
change is a problem that this Nation
and other nations need to address. In
fact, I believe it is important that we
continue to have discussions about se-
rious solutions on how to mitigate
these risks through American innova-
tion, conservation, adaptation, and
preparation. But, Madam Speaker, H.R.
9 is not a serious solution to these
problems.
The truth of the matter is the Paris
Agreement would hurt our economy,
cost millions of American jobs, weaken
our sovereignty, and put us at a dis-
advantage among international com-
petitors, especially China.
My home State of Kentucky relies
heavily on fossil fuels, and the coal in-
dustry provides our State with thou-
sands of jobs and delivers over 83 per-
cent of our power. This enables Ken-
tuckians to enjoy some of the lowest-
cost electricity rates in the country.
Kentucky is not the only State that
relies on carbon-based fuels for its en-
ergy. Nationally, our energy mix is
made up of about 80 percent fossil
fuels, as compared to only 5 percent
intermittent and unreliable sources,
such as solar and wind.
Let’s think about the feasibility of
hitting the goals outlined in the Paris
Agreement to cut greenhouse emis-
sions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025 or, to
push the debate even further, those
goals outlined in the Democrats’ other
climate proposals, such as the Green
New Deal, to eliminate fossil fuels
completely, a proposal that just yester-
day every member of the majority
voted against bringing up for debate.
That is because the Green New Deal is
nothing more than an absurd socialist
fantasy that would devastate our econ-
omy.
As policymakers, our goal should not
be to embrace at all costs the greenest
energy. Our goal should be to promote
the best energy, the most effective en-
ergy, the most reliable energy, and the
most affordable energy.
Despite massive technological ad-
vances and innovations, any drastic
move away from fossil fuel consump-
tion is dangerous. It would mean in-
creased energy prices and decreased re-
liability. Household electricity expend-
itures would increase up to 20 percent.
It would mean manufacturing and en-
ergy-intensive jobs moving offshore. On
average, we would see a shortfall of
nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs and
400,000 jobs overall.
It would mean economic decline and
stagnation in communities, yielding an
aggregate GDP loss of over $2.5 trillion
and a total income loss for a family of
four of over $20,000.
It is only common sense that we en-
sure that these economic outcomes will
never come to fruition before entering
into this agreement, which is what this
simple amendment would do.
Remember, between 2000 and 2014, the
United States reduced greenhouse gas
emissions by 18 percent without being
subject to any international agree-
ment.
We should continue to focus on re-
ducing emissions, developing and ex-
porting clean coal technologies, and
making our communities more resil-
ient, but 1,000 more pages in the Fed-
eral Register will not change the
weather. Scientific and technological
innovation fueled through free enter-
prise can.
Finally, if we want to be serious
about a global solution to climate
change, we need to address the world’s
largest carbon emissions offenders that
have refused to meet the agreement’s
goals. This agreement fails to address
those real polluters.
China, the number one country in the
world for greenhouse gas emissions, is
perhaps our greatest strategic eco-
nomic adversary. It is a nation that
has been growing in manufacturing and
industrial dominance.
Under the Paris Agreement, China
has been allowed to increase emissions
until 2030. This gives China a leg up.
They will spend that decade stealing
our jobs. That hits people in my dis-
trict the hardest. It hits those who can
least afford it.
As we confront China economically,
we must be sure our environmental
goals do not put us at a strategic dis-
advantage or force us to commit eco-
nomic self-destruction. We must ensure
that our policies do not raise electric
rates and drive energy-intensive busi-
nesses offshore. We must make sure
that China, with its rapacious appetite
for dominating all industry and its
sweeping efforts to steal U.S. ideas,
does not have new reasons to take ad-
vantage of American workers.
Madam Speaker, socialism and cen-
tral planning will never solve the prob-
lems of the human race. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on
the motion to recommit.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
I rise in opposition to the motion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
our Republican colleagues are right
about one thing: China is taking ad-
vantage of us. But it is not taking ad-
vantage of America being in the Paris
accord. It is taking advantage of our
retreat.
China is our strategic competitor. It
should pain all of us that everywhere
around the world, China is being treat-
ed like the leader in fighting climate
change. It should pain us that China is
investing more money in renewable en-
ergy than any other country. It should
pain us that they are surging ahead of
us in electric vehicles. It should pain
us that they are racing to dominate
the global market in lithium batteries,
that they have two-thirds of the
world’s high-speed rail and have spent
over $100 billion on it in 2018.
Why is China spending hundreds of
billions of dollars to make the transi-
tion to clean energy? Let me tell you,
it is not because the Chinese Com-
munist Party loves trees. It is because
they want to win the future.
I want America to win the future. I
want us to reap the economic benefits
and the jobs that will go to whoever
wins the race to a clean energy future.
How do our Republican colleagues
propose to win that race? I have looked
at their record in the years when they
controlled this House. I searched in
vain for one free-market-based plan.
What did I find? Nothing, apart from
a tax bill filled with giveaways to oil
companies to allow more oil drilling,
and legislation to allow methane emis-
sions, to gut the Clean Air Act, and to
roll back the Clean Power Plan.
That is it. That is all our Republican
colleagues did.
Do they know who has left them be-
hind? Do they know who wants us to
stay in the Paris accord because they
know that our economic future depends
on it? I will tell you who. The Dow
Chemical Company wants us to stay in
Paris. Bank of America wants us to
stay. DuPont wants us to stay. Procter
& Gamble wants us to stay. General
Electric wants us to stay. Cargill
wants us to stay. Citigroup wants us to
stay. Johnson & Johnson wants us to
stay. Coca-Cola wants us to stay.
ExxonMobil wants us to stay. The Walt
Disney Company wants us to stay.
Not a lot of socialists on their
boards, though I do have my doubts
about Goofy from time to time.
So that is our choice. We can cling to
the past, we can let China win this
race, or we can stand with our Amer-
ican companies, our American sci-
entists, and our American innovators
and let them lead us into the future.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
I yield to the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM).
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker,
as a former ocean engineer, I rise on
behalf of South Carolina’s First Con-
gressional District, the Low Country.
And I rise, quite frankly, as someone
who typically votes with Republicans
on these motions.
But not today.

the other side of the aisle would want

to engage in a constructive dialogue
that addresses the devastating impacts
of flooding, intensifying storms, and
rising sea levels.
But not today.
This is not the way that it used to be.
President Teddy Roosevelt established
150 national forests and five national
parks. President Reagan signed into
law 38 bills that added more than 10.6
million acres to the National Wilder-
ness Preservation System, all with the
support of the distinguished Members
of the Grand Old Party.
But not today.
The Grand Old Party has an illus-
trious history with environmental con-
servation, a history it should be proud
of.
But not today.
This Republican body does a dis-
service to that environmental record
by turning a blind eye to science and
facts. There are certain things that go
beyond politics, impacts that touch
each and every one of us, regardless of
partisanship, regardless of ideology.
Climate change is one of them. The
Low Country knows this more than
most.
In downtown Charleston, our medical
district, which is home to Charleston’s
VA hospital and our medical univer-
sity, is the area that is most prone to
flooding. During a recent hurricane,
the Medical University of South Caro-
lina was forced to float surgeons across
the campus in jon boats to treat pa-
tients, including our veterans and our
children.
Parris Island is one of the only two
bases that makes enlisted marines, and
the only base that makes female en-
listed marines in our country.

A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, as an
original co-sponsor of H.R. 9—Climate Action
Now Act, I would have voted YES on rollcall
#184, had I been present.
f
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, and ask for its immediate
consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I urge
that the Speaker would immediately
schedule this important bill that will
save lives.

tleman has not been recognized for de-

HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMOR-
ROW, AND ADJOURNMENT FROM
FRIDAY, MAY 3, 2019, TO TUES-

Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that when the
House adjourns today, it adjourn to
meet at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow, and fur-
ther, when the House adjourns on that
day, it adjourn to meet at noon on
Tuesday next for morning-hour debate
and 2 p.m. for legislative business.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
SHALALA). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Maryland?
There was no objection.
f
THE RISING COST OF
HEALTHCARE
(Mr. MCADAMS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I
rise to address what, for my constitu-
ents, is an urgent concern: the rising
cost of healthcare. I hear about it ev-
erywhere I go.
Healthcare is personal. Having access
to quality, affordable care is central to
our quality of life and our ability to de-
cide where we live and where we work.
At a healthcare townhall I held last
week, I heard from people such as a
small business owner who worried that,
while the very poor and wealthy have
coverage options, she struggles to find
an affordable policy for her family. She
said: Please don’t forget about people
like me.
Another woman talked about how
complicated her copays were for the
drug treatment prescribed by her doc-
tor, and another asked about the con-
fusion surrounding billing codes and in-
voices.
Healthcare is probably the most com-
plex issue we will address in Congress.
My top goals include to ensure that
Federal law continues to protect people
with preexisting conditions, to pro-
mote coverage and enrollment, and to
find solutions to bring down costs.
I believe that a good first step will be
passing three bipartisan bills to make
the drug market more competitive and
prices more transparent:
The CREATES Act, which address an
outrageous action by some name-brand
companies to unfairly stop generics;
The BLOCKING Act, to stop ‘‘first’’
generic drug ‘‘parking’’; and
The drug price STAR Act, to improve
transparency.
With the cost of prescription drugs
increasing dramatically, we need to
take steps now.
f
NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to bring attention to the Na-
tional Day of Prayer, a day that exists
to encourage prayer for America.
Since our country’s founding, from
Washington to Lincoln to Kennedy to
Trump, prayer to our Creator has
served as our most important resource
during times of celebration and days of
trial.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3430 May 2, 2019
With the same spirit as those who
fled the shores of Europe to escape reli-
gious persecution, we welcome this day
as one in which we can come together
as a people in gratitude for our free-
doms and our prosperity, but also in
earnest petition for forgiveness, unity,
mercy, guidance, and favor.
The National Day of Prayer is a day
for all Americans to reflect on our
many blessings and to recognize where
our ultimate source of strength and
hope comes from—our Creator.
At a time in history where our Na-
tion is more divided than ever, I call
for us to commit ourselves to prayer
this day, to seek the God which has
blessed this Nation for 242 years, and to
begin again to live out this year’s
theme, to love and serve one another.
f
HONORING JUDGE DAMON KEITH
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to give honor to a great pub-
lic servant, Judge Damon Keith. Judge
Damon Keith was a judge of the United
States Court of Appeals.
He was born on July 4, 1922, a fitting
day for someone who so believed in
American democracy.
He attended Howard and was
mentored by the future Supreme Court
Justice, Thurgood Marshall.
In 1967, he was nominated to a seat
on the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan by
President Johnson. This nomination
came at the suggestion of Michigan
Senator Phil Hart, the remarkable
namesake of the Hart Senate Office
Building.
Judge Keith’s career was spent fight-
ing for civil rights and civil liberties,
particularly for communities within
the 14th District. He stood for trans-
parency in government.
Judge Keith will be sorely missed,
but his years of tireless service as a
champion for civil rights will never be
forgotten.
In 2002, he issued an opinion on the
secret hearings for alleged terrorists
after the 9/11 attacks. He famously
wrote: ‘‘Democracies die behind closed
doors.’’
f
IN HONOR OF RAY ECKSTEIN
(Mr. COMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor and remember the en-
trepreneurial spirit and compassionate
philanthropy of Ray Eckstein, who
passed away on April 20, 2019, at the
age of 93.
After receiving a law degree from
Marquette University, Mr. Eckstein
founded Wisconsin Barge Line. He later
sold the business and formed Mar-
quette Transportation, leading him to
relocate to Paducah, Kentucky. His
business had a profound economic im-
pact and brought numerous jobs to the
region.
Mr. Eckstein and his wife touched
the lives of many through the estab-
lishment of the Ray and Kay Eckstein
Charitable Trust. The couple’s gen-
erosity has, no doubt, had a tremen-
dous impact on the local community.
Over the years, they have gifted the
area they loved with a hospice care
center, regional cancer care center, and
heart and vascular institute, all named
in their honor.
Mr. Eckstein was widely known for
his warm, compassionate spirit and de-
votion to his family. I join with all
those who knew him to express our
gratitude for his outstanding contribu-
tions to western Kentucky.
May God continue to bless the many
members of his family through whom
his memory lives on.

VETERAN SUICIDE—A NATIONAL
CRISIS
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
as we enter the month of May, many of
us will be gathering at the end of the
month to honor and recognize those
who have fallen.
In mid-month, we will celebrate the
mothers of this Nation, many of whom
are veterans and who have died in bat-
tle.
I rise today to speak about veteran
suicide, and to view it as a national
crisis. It is told that there are 20 vet-
erans a day committing suicide.
So, as I stand here today, tragically,
a man or woman who has worn the uni-
form, who is willing to sacrifice him-
self or herself for this Nation, for the
freedom of our people, for democracy,
is taking their life.
This is such a national crisis that I
believe that this should be a major
issue for all of us to ensure that we
find the resources, including the re-
sources for family members, early
counseling, and a helping hand to en-
sure that those veterans who find
themselves lonely or homeless and feel
that there is no other way out but to
commit suicide—many of them
young—that we will find a way to leg-
islate, but also to protect the men and
women who stood for us.
f
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise
for the purpose of inquiring of the ma-
jority leader the schedule for the next
week to come.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER),
the majority leader.
b 1230
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
On Tuesday, Madam Speaker, the
House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-
hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative
business, with votes postponed until
6:30 p.m.
On Wednesday and Thursday, the
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-
hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative
business.
On Friday, the House will meet at 9
a.m. for legislative business.
We will consider several bills under
suspension of the rules. The complete
list of suspension bills will be an-
nounced by the close of business to-
morrow.
The House will also consider H.R. 986,
the Protecting Americans with Pre-
existing Conditions Act of 2019.
On October 22, 2018, the Trump ad-
ministration continued the Republican
assault on affordable, quality health
coverage by issuing new guidance to
carry out section 1332 of the Affordable
Care Act.
That new guidance, Madam Speaker,
undermines patient protections and
threatens coverage for Americans with
preexisting conditions. H.R. 986 blocks
implementation of that guidance so as
to preserve preexisting condition pro-
tections and ensure that healthcare re-
mains affordable and comprehensive.
In addition, Madam Speaker, the
House will consider H.R. 2157, the Sup-
plemental Appropriations Act of 2019.
The legislation would provide relief
and recovery assistance for Americans
affected by recent natural disasters. It
includes an additional $3 billion above
that which we passed and sent to the
Senate some weeks ago to address ur-
gent needs following flooding in the
Midwest and tornadoes in the South
that have occurred since the House
passed its first disaster relief bill in
January, which, unfortunately, has
languished in the Senate.
Lastly, the bill includes an extension
of the National Flood Insurance Pro-
gram until September 30, 2019.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
would point out that the President’s
executive order on section 1332 does
nothing to change the protections in
law for people with preexisting condi-
tions under ObamaCare. As the gen-
tleman knows, the law protects people
with preexisting conditions from facing
any kind of discrimination, and the
section 1332 waivers have nothing to do
with that.
What they do is allow some States—
and there have been a number of States
who have requested—the ability to be
more innovative and focus on lowering
premiums while protecting preexisting
conditions.
Those States that have taken advan-
tage of that waiver have used it to,
number one, provide healthcare in dif-
ferent ways, more innovative ways for
their Medicaid population.
That is something we should all en-
courage because Medicaid in many
States is the worst form of healthcare.
In many cases, doctors don’t even take
Medicaid policies and don’t see Med-
icaid patients, so they can’t get access
to care.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3431
May 2, 2019
These waivers are a way to help open
more access to care at lower costs, in
many cases, while protecting pre-
existing conditions.
With that said, when the gentleman
laid out the schedule, I didn’t see any-
thing on the President’s request for
supplemental funding for the border
crisis. Specifically, there was a $4.5 bil-
lion request that came down from the
White House for additional funding to
address this wave of people who are
coming into our country illegally.
In many cases, they have run out of
detention beds. They are overwhelming
the system, and it has been reported
very widely. That is why the President
made the $4.5 billion request.
I wanted to ask the gentleman if that
might be included in this supplemental
for the disasters that we would surely
like to be addressed.
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the gentleman’s comments. I
won’t respond to his initial comments.
Obviously, we have a disagreement on
the impact that the administration has
had on preexisting conditions and on
the section to which we are referring.
But we will have a full debate on that
next week when we consider the bill.
With respect to the gentleman’s
question as it relates to the President’s
proposal for supplemental funding for
border security, which, by the way, was
sent down yesterday and is now being
reviewed, the gentleman knows that we
are strong supporters of border secu-
rity, and we want to make sure that
the border is also humane.
The gentleman did not mention, but
I want to point out, that in the bill
that we adopted to fund the govern-
ment that was shut down for 35 days, in
the bill that we passed, there was $755
million for construction and tech-
nology at ports of entry where most
drugs come into the country illegally.
We want to make sure those drugs
stop.
We want to have border infrastruc-
ture that allows for not only security
but checking people who are coming
into the country to make sure they do
not have illicit substances with them,
either for their own use or for sale.
In addition to that, we had $415 mil-
lion for Border Patrol and Customs
agents and for humanitarian relief,
which, obviously, was anticipating the
problem that currently confronts us
and to make sure that people who come
across our border are treated humanely
and with respect.
In addition, there was $30.5 million
for alternatives to detention and fam-
ily case management, which we think
is important.
In addition to that, there was a half
billion dollars, $563 million, for immi-
gration judges to reduce the backlog of
cases.
Lastly, there was a half-billion dol-
lars, $527 million, to assist Central
American countries, which has had a
positive effect on reducing crime and
violence, one of the major reasons that
people are fleeing those countries, par-
ticularly the Northern Triangle coun-
tries, and seeking asylum in the United
States of America, pursuant to Amer-
ican law.
But we are reviewing. We want to
make sure, as I said at the beginning,
that our borders are secure and that we
are treating people consistent with
American law, not separating children
from their families.
The President says he wants to per-
haps renew that policy. We are vigor-
ously opposed to that policy. We think
the President is wrong in citing pre-
vious administrations that separated
children. They did so in very few in-
stances, almost exclusively when they
were concerned about the safety of a
child because of a parent’s actions to-
ward the child.
I will tell the gentleman that we are
going to be reviewing the President’s
request very carefully. Ms. ROYBAL-
ALLARD, who chairs the committee,
and Mr. THOMPSON, who chairs the
Homeland Security Committee, both
will be looking at it carefully. We will
be making recommendations in the
near future as to the disposition of
that proposal.
Mr. SCALISE. Reclaiming my time,
Madam Speaker, at the final end of
your spending bill, we got a start on
addressing the problem of border secu-
rity. We had very intense negotiations,
and the President laid out the mul-
titude of things that need to be done to
get full control over the border, which
we do not have.
That was a start. As the gentleman
knows, it surely hasn’t stopped the
flow of people who have been coming
across, especially these caravans, these
organized caravans, in the thousands
per day, which is overwhelming our
system. I wish it would stop.
I wish we would address all the inte-
rior security problems and magnet
laws, like catch and release and the
asylum loopholes, that are encouraging
people to come here illegally, in many
cases overwhelming our own system.
As the gentleman reviews that sup-
plemental, hopefully, we can come to
an agreement on how to, at least in the
interim, address the problem. But ulti-
mately, long term, we need a solution.
We will continue to work on that.
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
The point of reciting the dollars that
were included just some weeks ago to
the administration is to point out that
they had clearly significant sums with
which to operate now, and we will see
what funds they need in the future. But
I wanted to point out that we have not
been negligent or sleeping, with respect
to both border security and the human-
itarian treatment of those who come
across our border seeking asylum.
As I said, we will review it and see
what determination needs to be made
on what further resources are nec-
essary.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, that
debate will go on. Hopefully, we can
start addressing some of the long-term
problems.
Madam Speaker, I wanted to ask the
gentleman, finally, about legislation to
confront this BDS movement, a major
threat to our ally Israel. It attempts to
undermine its economy. There is legis-
lation, and of course, there is a bipar-
tisan resolution, the Schneider-Zeldin
legislation, which I strongly support,
that at least calls out the BDS move-
ment.
As we have also seen, we need teeth.
We need real tools that we can provide
to not just our friend Israel, but also
States, many States that are also try-
ing to confront this problem and push
back against the BDS movement. The
McCaul bill addresses that, similar to a
Senate bill that passed with over 70
votes—very bipartisan.
In fact, I believe there are amend-
ments being put together to make the
McCaul bill identical to the Senate
bill. Then the question is, can we get
some kind of commitment—and I know
we have talked about this before—to
bring that bill to the floor so that we
can finally, truly confront this growing
problem of the BDS movement across
not only the world but within our
country, and do it with real teeth, like
the bipartisan McCaul bill?
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, as the
gentleman knows, and I thank him for
his observation, the bill to which he re-
fers has essentially four parts, includ-
ing a provision with reference to the
MOU for Israel’s assistance package,
which we strongly support. We strong-
ly support the levels of that. That was
not controversial.
Also, the Syria sanctions bill—of
course, we have passed the Syria sanc-
tions bill, and we are working on other
bills that relate to that.
Unfortunately, they are being held
up in the Senate by some Republican
Senators. The Syria sanctions bill has
not been moved in the Senate. It also
has the Jordan MOU, which is non-
controversial. It has Syria, Jordan, and
the MOU. Those are the three factors.
One is controversial.
It is controversial because of whether
or not it comports with the law. There
have been a substantial number of
State cases that have been ruled on,
State actions taken on this issue that
have been held not to be consistent
with law and the Constitution.
We are concerned about that because
I share the gentleman’s view. I am an
opponent of the BDS movement. I
think it harms one of our most impor-
tant allies, and it is inconsistent with,
I think, the welfare of the people in
Israel and, frankly, the Palestinians in
the West Bank.
Having said that, we are strong sup-
porters of the resolution. That resolu-
tion has bipartisan support, I think,
and if it comes to the floor, it will have
bipartisan support. The gentleman in-
dicated that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3432 May 2, 2019
We intend to come forward with that,
but we are trying to work to make sure
that other suggestions are consistent
with law, and we may move with those
as well.
We haven’t made that determination
yet.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate it. I understand that there
hasn’t been any determination yet, but
there is a growing frustration that this
needs to be addressed by the Congress.
There is a move to initiate a discharge
petition to get that bill brought to the
floor, so those discussions will con-
tinue.
Hopefully, we can address the prob-
lem of BDS not only in a resolution but
also in legislation that has teeth in law
to help those States that want to con-
front it and also to help, in a bigger
way, our ally Israel.
My final point is on the process that
we have seen. Of course, this week,
there was only one bill that came
under a rule. As far as amendments go,
we have seen a growing trend toward
shutting out Republican amendments.
If I can just go through it with the
gentleman, as we have looked in this
Congress, of the amendments that have
come out of the Rules Committee, 74
percent of those amendments were
Democratic amendments; 14 percent
were Republican amendments; and 12
percent were bipartisan.
If I can compare it to the last Con-
gress when we were in the majority,
there were, in fact, more Democratic
amendments than Republican amend-
ments allowed. Forty-five percent of
the amendments were Democratic; 38
percent were Republican in our Repub-
lican majority; and 17 percent were bi-
partisan.
When you compare last Congress
when we were in the majority, we let
more Democratic amendments to the
floor than Republican amendments.
So far, we have seen a complete re-
versal of that, where our amendments
have been shut out at a very high level,
again, 74 percent to 14 percent.
I would ask if the gentleman can
look at addressing this problem and try
to bring some parity to the floor proc-
ess as it relates to that disparity, and
I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for his comments.
Of course, what the gentleman didn’t
say is that the last Congress had the
most closed rules of any Congress in
which I have served, the most closed
Congress that we have served in, ac-
cording to outside observers.
There were 30 amendments available
to this bill. I am not sure how many
were asked on the Democratic side or
the Republican side, frankly. But hav-
ing said that, there were Republican
amendments made in order. Mr.
MCGOVERN, the chairman of the Rules
Committee, has said he intends to have
as many amendments made in order as
they believe consistent with getting
our work done.
b 1245
So I would say to the gentleman, un-
like the last Congress, I think you will
see closed rules be very much the ex-
ception while, frankly, they were very
much the rule in the last Congress. But
I take the gentleman’s point, and I will
have discussions with Mr. MCGOVERN.
But as you know and I know he is one
of the fairest Members in this House,
and we will be trying to accommodate
Members.
I will also say that the gentleman’s
statistics include the appropriations
process, where there were a lot of
amendments on both sides of the aisle.
We have not gotten to the appropria-
tions process. As you know, it is my in-
tention that we get to the appropria-
tions process and, frankly, try to con-
clude the appropriations process next
month, and I am sure there are going
to be a lot of amendments coming from
both sides.
Mr. SCALISE. I hope when we get to
that appropriations process that there
would be open rules, as we did.
And I guess the gentleman doesn’t
have to worry about his majority
breaking the record of closed rules, be-
cause this week we only had one rule,
and, in fact, again, a modified rule,
where over 30 of our amendments were
shut out. Hopefully, more legislation
starts moving through the process.
When we look at last Congress, we
passed over 50 rules last Congress. So
far, this Congress, only 34 rules. We ac-
tually had 30 bills signed into law at
this point in the last Congress, 30 bills
signed into law under our majority,
only 16 signed into law here. Hopefully,
we see more productivity as well as
more openness in that process.
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land.
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman
for his comments.
I think the viewers and the Members
of Congress are probably glazed over
right now with these numbers, but I
will tell the gentleman, there was not
a single open rule in the House that
was presided over by Paul Ryan, not
one—not one. Check your record.
But as I say, Mr. MCGOVERN has
clearly said that we want to have
amendments made in order so that
both sides can get a fair hearing, and I
think he has been doing that, and I
think he will continue to do it.
Mr. SCALISE. Well, as eyes are glaz-
ing over, for clarity, there were many
rules where every single Democrat
amendment was included. So if you
want to call it a modified rule, closed
rule—for people watching, when Repub-
licans and Democrats go to the Rules
Committee to try to amend a bill,
when every single Democrat amend-
ment is allowed in, that is an open
process.
Today, for example, the only rule
today, over 30 Republican amendments
were shut out—over 30 were shut out.
So, many times we had rules where
every single Democrat amendment was
allowed. In the last Congress, more
Democrat amendments were allowed
than Republican amendments.
But this, hopefully, can get addressed
and corrected, and maybe when we get
to an appropriations process, it will be
more fair in that regard.
With that, I look forward to next
week, hopefully get some of those
things done.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
f
ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, we
had an interesting debate and inter-
esting vote today regarding the Paris
climate change agreement that is a
treaty. It hasn’t been properly treated
like a treaty, just like the Iran treaty
was a treaty.
No matter whether the House or the
Senate agreed to violate the Constitu-
tion and treat the Iran treaty in ex-
actly the opposite format as required
by the Constitution, it doesn’t matter.
It was treaty. It was never properly
ratified.
It doesn’t matter whether it was a
Republican or a Democrat who came up
with the bill. A Republican Senator or
House Member cannot come up with a
bill that changes the Constitution and
say: Do you know what? We are going
to take this treaty and act like you
have to have two-thirds to vote it down
instead of two-thirds to ratify it.
But that is what they did, so the
President did exactly the right thing.
It was time to stop giving billions of
dollars in both direct money aid to the
largest sponsor of terrorism, Iran.
It was also time to reimpose the
sanctions that had basically brought
Iran to its knees begging for help. Well,
the Obama administration helped them
in two ways: number one, allowing
them to pursue nuclear capabilities,
just doing it privately.
I am one of three people who met
with the two main inspectors from the
IAEA over in Europe, and they would
issue the statement each time that
they had seen no evidence that Iran
was developing nukes. They were asked
the question: Did you see the military
facilities that they keep so hidden in
secret and where their nuclear develop-
ment would be occurring?
In response, they said: No. Gee, they
gave us a video that they said came
from there, but we had never been al-
lowed to examine the facilities.
So the IAEA was not allowed to ex-
amine the facilities where nuclear
weapons would have been developed,
probably were being developed.
From Iran’s standpoint, based on how
ridiculous the agreement was and
knowing their mentality of cheating,
certainly they would have been pur-
suing nuclear weapons, whether or not
VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:33 May 03, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K02MY7.064 H02MYPT1

they would wait for 10 years before ac-
tually going public with actually hav-
ing nuclear weapons.
But I even asked: Okay. The Obama
administration sent them $150 billion
in cash. Say, hypothetically, Iran de-
cided, ‘‘We will just take some of that
$150 billion and buy us one, two, three,
four, five nukes from North Korea or
from Pakistan.’’
We know that during those final
years of the Obama administration
that Iran had met with Pakistani offi-
cials and with North Korean officials,
so that was certainly a possibility, but
I wondered if the IAEA had a capa-
bility of noting and discovering if Iran
were to import a nuclear weapon from,
say, North Korea or Russia or Paki-
stan. Apparently, unless the Iranians
brought their new nuclear weapons im-
mediately near the detection equip-
ment, there would be no way to know
that Iran bought nuclear weapons.
So, to anyone who used reason in
dealing with the largest supporter of
terrorism in the world, responsible for
killing so many precious American
military members and others, Presi-
dent Trump did a great thing. He did
the right thing. It was a great thing to
do for America’s future safety; it was a
great thing to do for the world’s safety;
and it was absolutely a helpful thing to
do for the nation of Israel. So that was
smart.
We have had these different climate
accords, and what so many of them
have in common, basically, was, gee,
we will pay the world lots of money,
supposedly some type of guilt money,
even though we have been more philan-
thropic than any other country in the
history of the world.
To any astute eye examining the
state of the world and world history, it
becomes very clear that the only coun-
tries that are able to do anything
about pollution on the planet are coun-
tries that have a strong, vibrant econ-
omy. Countries that are struggling are
doing all they can to put people to
work and to survive. They just can’t
spare the money to clean up the envi-
ronment.
You have got countries like China
and India, massive polluters, and under
these accords, heck, China wouldn’t
even have requirements for them to
clean things up until 2030, and by then,
there would be all new agreements that
would probably give China even more
time.
These accords appear to be geared to
do one thing: do damage to the econ-
omy of the one country that is doing so
much to clean up carbon emissions and
to clean up pollution.
I have an article here from Forbes.
This is back in the fall of 2017. Yes, the
U.S. leads all countries in reducing car-
bon emissions—and that was 10 months
into the Obama administration—but,
as the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy announced, we are leading the world
with respect to our CO2 footprint in re-
ductions.
The Washington Post fact-checked
this claim and rated it three
Pinocchios, which means they rate the
claim mostly false.
They further wrote that Pruitt’s
usage of data appeared to be a delib-
erate effort to mislead the public. But
the data mostly supports Pruitt’s
claim. You have to consider the source,
Madam Speaker.
Just like during my days on the
bench as a felony judge, major civil
litigation, it was all about the credi-
bility of the witness.
As we have seen, The Washington
Post is exceedingly biased and slanted
in their reporting, so we need a source
that gives Pinocchios to The Wash-
ington Post.
If you look at the 2017 BP Statistical
Review of World Energy, since 2005, an-
nual U.S. carbon dioxide emissions
have declined by 758 million metric
tons. That is, by far, the largest de-
cline of any country in the world over
that time span, and it is nearly as
large as the 770 million metric ton de-
cline for the entire European Union.
By comparison, the second largest
decline during that period was reg-
istered by the United Kingdom, which
reported a 170 million metric ton de-
cline. So we had a 758 million metric
ton decline in carbon emissions in that
year, and the U.K. was second. They
were not quite up to our 758 million
metric tons. They were at 170 million
metric ton decline.
But, at the same time, China’s car-
bon dioxide emissions grew—that is
grew—by 3 billion metric tons, and In-
dia’s grew by 1 billion metric tons.
So we are over here in the United
States trying not to destroy our econ-
omy and yet cleaning up the environ-
ment more than anybody else in the
world, and this ridiculous accord—real-
ly, a treaty—allows the biggest pol-
luters in the world to keep polluting
much more, just either one of those,
than the rest of the world.
b 1300
It is just phenomenal.
The article goes on: ‘‘The Wash-
ington Post gets into per capita emis-
sions, and indeed despite the decline,
U.S. per capita emissions are still
among the highest in the world. How-
ever, The Washington Post story
claimed: ‘The United States may have
had the largest decrease in carbon
emissions, but it is still the largest per
capita emitter.’
‘‘That’s not accurate either.
‘‘According to World Bank data, U.S.
per capita carbon dioxide emissions
rank 11th among countries. So, we are
not the largest per capita emitter, but
we do emit 2.2 times as much on a per
capita basis as China. But, China has
4.3 times as many people, and that
matters from an overall emissions per-
spective. China’s lower per capita car-
bon dioxide emissions are more than
offset by its greater population, so
China emits over 70 percent more car-
bon dioxide annually than the U.S.’’
So, there is a lot of manipulation as
to what is going on, but it is ridiculous
for the United States to be part of a
treaty in which the United States is
punished, and our economy punished
and the American people punished even
though we are cutting the rate of car-
bon dioxide emissions more than any-
one else.
Another article from Liz Peek on The
Hill: ‘‘China’s rising emissions prove
Trump right on Paris Agreement.’’
This article is from last year: ‘‘Noth-
ing horrifies the intelligentsia more
than President Trump’s withdrawal
from the Paris Agreement on climate
change. But, based on new information
on China’s emissions, it increasingly
looks like the President made the right
call.
‘‘Just last week, an analysis from
Greenpeace indicated that China’s
2018’’—and the numbers we were
quoting before were from the year be-
fore—‘‘carbon emissions were on track
to grow at the fastest rate in 6 years.
The study, based on government data
regarding the use of coal and other en-
ergy sources, shows carbon output ris-
ing 4 percent in the first quarter of this
year. Analysts are projecting similar
gains over the next several quarters.
‘‘The weakness of the Paris Agree-
ment was that it was lopsided, requir-
ing little from China and a great deal
from the U.S. President Obama com-
mitted the United States to reducing
carbon emissions in 2025 by 26 to 28 per-
cent, which would have meant a sub-
stantial jump in electricity costs.
‘‘By contrast, China committed to
boosting nonfossil fuels to around 20
percent of its overall energy mix by
2030 and a ‘hope’ that emissions might
peak at that time. As one analyst com-
mented in The New York Times, ‘What
China is pledging to do here is not a lot
different from what China’s policies
are on track to deliver.’’’
So, the President really did do the
right thing for the American public.
We lost a great man, a former Mem-
ber of this body, in John Dingell. He
and I had disagreements over some
issues, but I knew John Dingell—I
knew, and I know—was an honest man.
He was an honorable man. He was a
very decent man. He was a genuine
asset to this legislative body.
He followed the rules. He made oth-
ers follow the rules. Yet, he was re-
moved as chairman of the Committee
on Energy and Commerce, even though
he was looking forward to working dili-
gently on a healthcare bill.
He was removed as chairman of the
committee because he made a state-
ment that can still be found on
YouTube. Like I said, he was an honest
man. He did not want to move the cap
and trade bill out of his committee. As
he said, that cap and trade bill was ba-
sically—the big thing in it was a car-
bon tax. He said that cap and trade bill
is not only a tax; it is a great big one.
And he had talked about how, when
you skyrocket the costs of energy, you
know, the rich people are inconven-
ienced, but it is the poor in the Nation,
it is the lower middle class, it is the

senior citizens on a fixed income, on
Social Security, where they may go for
years without getting a cost-of-living
increase, and, even if they get one, it
doesn’t keep up with skyrocketing en-
ergy costs.
And he could not abide hurting poor
people—hardworking, lower middle
class people—with skyrocketing energy
that they couldn’t afford to pay for.
And that is where so many of these
things lead. If we are going to have
compassion for the people that are the
working poor, for heaven’s sake, the
last thing you want to do to them is
skyrocket the cost of what they abso-
lutely have to have just to exist.
In America today, you have got to
have energy, whether it is electric en-
ergy, whether it is natural gas energy,
gasoline, diesel. You have got to have
energy. Even a wood-burning stove.
You have got to have energy.
These kinds of bills that push for
these kinds of efforts devastate the
working poor in this country.
Here is an article from Justin
Sykes—it also is from 2017—analyzing
Obama’s Paris Agreement. The title
says, ‘‘All Cost and No Benefit for the
U.S.’’
So, I am pleased that President
Trump withdrew us from the treaty
that was never properly ratified and
that would continue to send jobs to
China and India from the United
States.
We have a President who under-
stands, before America can continue to
be the most philanthropic country in
the world, helping those less fortunate,
you need a vibrant economy. And sim-
ply bringing the U.S. economy down to
the almost no rate of growth during
the Obama years is not going to help us
help other countries.
So, the economy, as some may re-
call—you can go back and see Presi-
dent Obama talking in terms of basi-
cally the 3 percent growth is a thing of
the past; the economy can’t grow past
that; we need to get used to the new
normal.
Well, under this President, the new
normal is over 3 percent growth, and
the only chance we have to overcome
our massive deficit and growing deficit
is to get the economy going so strongly
that it grows in enough sufficient man-
ner that we are able to start paying
down our deficit, if we will just quit
the massive overspending.
Now, we have had quite a show—real-
ly, more of a circus—in our Judiciary
Committee the last couple of days. It
has really been outrageous. The Judici-
ary Committee ought to be, if anything
the last bastion of civility in this town.
The Judiciary Committee should be
the committee from which good rules
emanate that inspire others in the
country and around the world that we
have a model that can be followed.
What occurred in our Judiciary Com-
mittee in the last 2 days has made a
mockery of the legislative process.
And something that our committee,
under our new majority, Democrat ma-
jority, has not been willing to focus on
that is a threat to our First, Second,
Fourth, and Fifth Amendment rights is
the overreach by the Department of
Justice, by the FBI, and potentially by
the Intel community, in taking away
Americans’ right to have privacy in
their phone conversations, in their
emails; their right to have a court sys-
tem in which the judges are not closer
to being a prosecutor than they are ac-
tual even-handed judges.
And one of the things that is a huge
concern for me and should be a huge
concern for all Americans—I know it
used to be a big concern with our now
Chairman NADLER. My first term here
in ’05 and ’06, at that time Congress-
man NADLER was a great stalwart in
pushing for privacy rights and civil lib-
erties to make sure the government
under the Bush administration didn’t
overreach.
But an interesting thing happened on
the way to their majority and having
the Obama administration in charge,
which seemed to be a complete loss of
interest in protecting civil liberties of
people whom the Obama administra-
tion chose to spy on.
And I know that the Attorney Gen-
eral has said he is going to be following
up with critically important investiga-
tions now, but I would hope—and
maybe the majority just really doesn’t
want to protect Americans’ rights, is
more focused on trying to destroy the
current President.
But there are things that have now
arisen. Evidence is clear: massive,
widespread abuse at the top of the FBI,
top of the DOJ, potentially in the Intel
area. And even to the point that we
would have a special prosecutor, Rob-
ert Mueller, who, in the words of
Wilford Brimley: Last time we had a
leak like this, Noah built himself an
ark.
That seems to be what has happened
under Mueller’s watch, when he was at
the FBI, under Mueller’s watch as a
special counsel.
And a good example is in this article
from BuzzFeed. They are certainly no
fan of mine, but the News Editor-in-
Chief Ben Smith has this article from
April 18, 2019. In this article he says:
‘‘Our reporters’’—talking about the
BuzzFeed reporters—‘‘went back to the
two senior law enforcement sources
who had told them, as the article put
it, that ‘Donald Trump directed his
longtime attorney Michael Cohen to lie
to Congress about negotiations to build
a Trump Tower in Moscow, according
to two Federal law enforcement offi-
cials involved in an investigation of
the matter.’’’
That means there has got to be a
couple of people on the Mueller team
leaking information that turns out was
not accurate, but leaking information.
For one reason, obviously, since it
turned out not to be accurate: to do
harm to the President of the United
States. That is not the job of the De-
partment of Justice or the FBI.
b 1315
Further down in the article it says—
and this is a news editor-in-chief talk-
ing at BuzzFeed—‘‘Our story was based
on detailed information from senior
law enforcement sources. That report-
ing included documents specifically’’—
and get this—‘‘specifically pages of
notes that were taken during an inter-
view of Cohen by the FBI.’’
Now, we got to looking at this issue
back—regarding witness statements
that are taken down by the FBI, and it
is really time that the FBI came on up
into the 20th century, the latter half of
the 20th century. I am not even asking
them to come to the 21st century.
But a practice of the FBI has been—
and it is advantageous to law enforce-
ment that does this, it is not really
honorable, but it is advantageous—
they don’t like to film, or record state-
ments made by witnesses. They prefer
to have an FBI agent take notes of
their interpretation of what the wit-
ness is saying. If they recorded it, by
video, or audio tape, then, when there
was a question, Well, which is right;
the FBI agent’s notes, or the actual
words coming from the witness’s
mouth? Then you could go to the tape
and find out which was actually accu-
rate.
But when there is no recording, then,
advantage goes strictly, inures strict-
ly, to the benefit of the government
agent, because, gee, they have got no
convictions; they come into court. I
saw so many felonies being tried in my
court. I have tried felonies many times.
But you know which way the jury is
normally going to go? They are going
to believe the law enforcement officers,
especially prior to the last few years,
back when the FBI had a much higher,
well-thought of reputation. It has been
devastated in recent years.
But they come in and testify and the
witness says, that is not what I said.
You don’t get to see a video. You don’t
get to hear the audio of what the wit-
ness actually said. What you have to
decide between is this FBI agent that
has never been convicted and looks
good on the stand, sounds good on the
stand, and this defendant, that prob-
ably has a criminal record. So that
usually goes in the direction of the FBI
agent.
But now, most State and local law
enforcement offices have done more
and more to record statements, to
record what happens, so that juries can
see for themselves; so they don’t have
to judge between the credibility of law
enforcement or a defendant. They see
for themselves. They hear for them-
selves what was said or done.
The FBI doesn’t like to do that. They
much prefer to have agents make their
notes of their interpretation of what
the defendant said. And Mueller par-
ticularly loved that during his 12 years
as Director of the FBI, because his peo-
ple always got the benefit of the doubt,
and they were able to convict people
because the FBI agent, who may have
completely misinterpreted what was

said in his or her notes, they get the
benefit, and the defendant gets con-
victed. So that has been a great strat-
egy for law enforcement.
Some people felt like I was a hang-
’em-high-type felony judge, but I want-
ed fairness. We have got to have fair-
ness. And because of the credibility
issues of the FBI, I feel comfortable
Christopher Wray won’t do it. He is
more interested in trying to rebuild
the image of the FBI without actually
correcting anything.
So I am sure he is correcting some
things, but certainly, he is not chang-
ing 302, witness statements taken down
in writing as the FBI agents’ interpre-
tation.
And there are other indications he is
more interested in trying to have a
good front, making it look like the FBI
is better now. But there are actions
that do need to be taken.
But this story, going back to it; that
reporting included documents, specifi-
cally, pages of notes that were taken
during an interview of Cohen by the
FBI. ‘‘In those notes, one law enforce-
ment source wrote that: ‘DJT person-
ally asked Cohen to say negotiations
ended in January, and White House
Counsel office knew Cohen would give
false testimony to Congress. Sanc-
tioned by DJT. Joint lawyer team re-
viewed letter Cohen sent to SSCI about
his testimony about Trump Tower
Moscow, et al, knowing it contained
lies.’ ’’
Well, it turns out, those notes that
were taken by FBI agents were not ac-
curate, which, again, causes problems
for credibility.
But the real problem is the fact that
you had investigators, which must
have been FBI, working for the Mueller
team, and they are turning over docu-
ments that, at least, were law-enforce-
ment sensitive, and they are probably
classified to some level.
And as we know, as people looked
into it after former FBI Director
Comey basically admitted a crime,
that he had leaked information that he
had taken down or typed up in a memo
based on his conversation with the
President—well, under the FBI rules
and regulations, that is not his prop-
erty. It is not to be leaked. And yet, he
leaked it to a professor friend so that
the professor friend could get it out to
the press. I think it was the New York
Times.
But regardless, get it out to the press
for the sole purpose of trying to get a
special counsel appointed to harass
President Trump.
So you have got the former FBI Di-
rector—what kind of example is that?
Comey is knowingly leaking informa-
tion that was potentially criminal to
leak. And so when you have the FBI
Director potentially committing overt
crimes himself, what kind of example—
what do you expect that to do inside
the FBI?
As an example, I know from talking
to FBI agents from all over the coun-
try, they were, and still are, amazed at
the things that top people in the FBI in
Washington did to destroy FBI credi-
bility. Of course, I think part of that
was a result of Robert Mueller’s 5 year
up-or-out policy. He used it to elimi-
nate people in the FBI that had more
law enforcement experience than him.
He ran off thousands and thousands of
years of experienced, ethical, moral,
upstanding FBI agents.
I wonder why would an FBI agent, di-
rector, run off their most experienced
agents from all over the country? And
really, the only reason I can think of
that you would do that, you know
young guys coming right out of school
that are patriotic; they come in; they
take their orders. They don’t have the
experience to know when it is a stupid
order or maybe an improper order, and
so they are not going to talk back.
They are going to salute Mueller and
go do what he said; whereas, he knew
that people that are longer in the
tooth, that have been around, when he
ordered one of his ridiculous policies
into effect that he would later have to
repeal, he didn’t want the experienced
FBI agent saying, sir, I know it seems
like a good idea, but 15 years ago we
tried that and here was the result. It
doesn’t work out like you think it is
going to.
Mueller didn’t want anybody there
that would do that kind of thing. He
didn’t want anybody that knew more
than he did. He ran off thousands of
years of experience.
I cannot help personally but think, if
Mueller had not run off so many thou-
sands of years of FBI experience, there
would have been people around inside
the FBI who could have nudged an FBI
director like Comey to avoid commit-
ting crimes; could have encouraged an
idiot like Peter Strzok, maybe a great
law enforcement officer at one time,
but clearly immoral, illegal in his con-
duct, and a disgrace to the FBI, and a
guy that can lie with a smirk on his
face. That was pretty impressive.
But there would have been people
around to say, you can’t do that, and if
you don’t stop, I am going to report
you. Well, Mueller ran those guys off.
He didn’t want people like that.
A good example is the FBI agent
that—after Ted Stevens, under the
Mueller FBI, was tried and convicted of
a crime that he did not commit right
before the election—so he lost his seat
in the U.S. Senate—we had an FBI
agent come forward, he filed an affi-
davit that he swore to that the FBI
had, in effect, manufactured a case
against Ted Stevens that did not exist;
that he did not accept hundreds of
thousands of dollars’ worth of improve-
ments to his home. He paid for them.
He overpaid for them.
But the FBI did their raids. They hid
evidence that he needed to—it would
have exonerated him, not just raised a
reasonable doubt, but completely exon-
erated himself, and the FBI agent iden-
tified his superior that participated in
manufacturing that crime.
So what happened with Mueller as di-
rector of the FBI when he finds out, if
he didn’t already know, that he had a
supervisor agent who manufactured a
case to convict an innocent man?
Well, the Mueller FBI ran off the guy
that filed the affidavit because he had
a conscience, and Mueller didn’t want
people of conscience in the FBI under
him. He wanted people that would sa-
lute Mueller, salute the flag, and do
whatever he wanted done.
And apparently, in that case, it was
manufacturing a criminal case against
a U.S. Senator, the longest serving Re-
publican in the Senate at that time.
And, of course, you have the case of
Dr. Steven Hatfill. Mueller had no evi-
dence whatsoever that Steven Hatfill
was guilty of the anthrax crime that
killed and harmed people after 9/11.
And at one point, the nonexistence of
any evidence caused, apparently from
reports, President George W. Bush to
call Mueller in and say, hey, it doesn’t
look like there is any evidence here.
Are you really sure that Dr. Hatfill is
the anthrax defendant, the guy? And
Mueller reportedly said, I am 100 per-
cent certain.
There was no evidence. None. He just
had a feeling. He basically framed an
innocent man and ultimately, the U.S.
Government had to pay over $6 million
in settlement to Dr. Hatfill.
He didn’t really get his life back. We
still talk about him in terms of an-
thrax.
But when Mueller was asked if he had
any regrets, apologies, he said, abso-
lutely not. He had no apologies. He
didn’t care if he ruined an innocent
man’s life.
He never apologized about Ted Ste-
vens and, of course, Ted Stevens was
killed in a plane he would never have
been on if the Mueller FBI had not
manufactured a case against him.
b 1330
So it shouldn’t come as a big surprise
here that you have a Mueller team—it
has got to be Mueller investigators;
they were the ones that were doing this
investigation—and they are leaking
their own documents that are not to be
leaked, well, unless they are directed
to by Mueller, so I guess that is a pos-
sibility. But anyway, leaking this to
the press.
And it wasn’t just one FBI agent, ac-
cording to the BuzzFeed news editor in
chief, because he says, in the story he
wrote, that they had ‘‘senior law en-
forcement sources.’’
And they gave BuzzFeed—it is a lib-
eral news organization, being kind
here. They gave them the FBI notes to
try to bring pressure on Cohen. That is
the reason normally that law enforce-
ment does this, to build up public
hysteria against somebody and hatred
for someone so that they ultimately
give up and agree to testify however
they are asked to testify.
Now, this BuzzFeed editor also says:
‘‘At the time, the sources asked report-
ers to keep the information confiden-
tial, but with the publication of
Mueller’s report, they have permitted
its release.’’

That is so outrageous. I mean, was
nothing learned from the FBI framing
the wrong person in the Atlanta bomb-
ing case? Apparently not.
And then what happened to Curt
Weldon. He used to come speak from
this very podium multiple times in my
first term—I think it was mainly in
2006—and he kept alleging that the FBI
had information that they knew there
was going to be a terrorist attack, just
like what happened on 9/11.
I didn’t know how Congressman
Weldon knew what he was talking
about. He sure seemed to. He kept
making these allegations that the FBI
didn’t do their job. They could have
saved 3,000 American lives on 9/11.
Anyway, they were very tough alle-
gations against the FBI, and as a fresh-
man, I am thinking: Wow, Mueller has
got to come back and respond to this.
This looks bad for the FBI. Even
though he only took over shortly be-
fore 9/11, it still makes his FBI look
bad. Mueller has got to come out and
address this.
Apparently, Director Mueller, FBI
Director Mueller, did address the alle-
gations of Congressman Curt Weldon,
because 2 weeks before his election
that year, in 2006, there was a raid of
the Weldon office, his daughter’s law
office, and it was early morning, and
the press was all there.
Gee, had to have been the FBI. They
are doing the raid. They got the press
all there.
And in no time at all, there were
protestors with already-made signs at
Curt Weldon’s office calling him all
kinds of names, thief and different
things. And that, occurring 2 weeks be-
fore the election, caused him to nar-
rowly lose.
Then some months later, they were
notified by the FBI: Oh, by the way,
you can come get all that stuff we
seized during our raid. We didn’t really
use it for grand jury or anything.
They apparently used it to defeat
Curt Weldon as a Member of Congress,
who made them feel bad.
An intelligent person might ask:
Well, look, if that is what the FBI has
done to people in the past, whether
Hatfield or Weldon or Stevens, aren’t
you concerned about doing just what
Curt Weldon did?
And the fact is it should be a matter
of concern. We are seeing, even from
BuzzFeed, how the FBI will disclose in-
formation that is not even accurate to
bring down public opinion against both
a witness and, in that case, the Presi-
dent himself just to smear somebody’s
name even when it is not accurate.
So it should be a matter of concern.
But if people don’t stand up in this
body—actually, the way Jerry Nadler
used to years ago—about concerns with
Federal law enforcement activities, if
we don’t stand up here, nobody is going
to, and it isn’t going to get better.
So it is a risk we have got to take,
because somebody has got to speak up
about these outrageous abuses. And
they truly are abuses.
Now, as the evidence continues to
come out, what appears to be quite
clear was not that there was collusion
or conspiracy between the Trump cam-
paign to bring down Hilary Clinton as
a candidate, but the Russian effort has
not changed, not when they were the
Soviet Union and now that it is an
independent country of Russia. They
want to cause as much problem and di-
vision in the United States as they can,
and, boy, did it work this time.
Just a little over a week ago, appar-
ently, former MI6 agent, secret agent—
he is no 007, that is for sure. Chris-
topher Steele was hired by Fusion
GPS, that also hired Nellie Ohr, who is
the wife of a top FBI official named
Bruce Ohr. She was digging up dirt,
whatever she could find—that was why
she was hired—on Donald Trump; and
Christopher Steele, who hated can-
didate Donald Trump was hired to dig
up dirt on Donald Trump.
As I understand it, he didn’t even go
to Russia. He is calling, emailing,
whatever he needs to do to commu-
nicate, and word gets out around Rus-
sia this British agent now working for
the Clinton campaign through Fusion
GPS and working with at least one FBI
top official, he is looking for dirt on
Donald Trump in Russia.
Steele has now basically admitted:
You know what? It could well be that
the people that gave me this dirt about
prostitutes and Donald Trump that has
now turned out to be 100 percent fab-
ricated, it is possible that those could
be agents for Vladimir Putin.
You think? You bet.
Russia was able to divide this coun-
try and had plenty of willing accom-
plices in what turned out to be an out-
rageously corrupt top in the FBI and
some in the DOJ.
You know, I know Mr. Rosenstein has
said, oh, he was joking when he said he
would wear a wire into the Oval Office
to try to trap Donald Trump as Presi-
dent so they could try to remove him
as President. I mean, they were work-
ing on a coup.
But from what I understand, we know
he was not joking, because there was a
second meeting in which Andy McCabe
and another person, at least one more
person, were there when Rosenstein
brought it up on his own again: Hey, I
wasn’t kidding. I really am a team
player. I know you are mad at me for
the memo about Comey that allowed
him to be fired, but I am a team player.
I want to be part of the team. I will
wear a wire into the Oval Office to try
to trap the President. I am really will-
ing to do that.’’
And McCabe, apparently just blown
away that Rosenstein would offer to do
that again, goes back and has a meet-
ing with his subordinates and says: You
won’t believe Rosenstein just brought
up again he is willing to wear a wire
into the Oval Office. I don’t know what
is wrong with that guy.
Well, there is a massive stench that
has existed. It came about during the
Obama administration. It came about
when Robert Mueller ran off so many
of our incredibly qualified, upstanding
FBI agents.
I was hoping that when Christopher
Wray came in, he would help clean up
the mess, get rid of the bad actors, but
he has been more of hold what you
have got and try to make the picture
look rosier.
Why would I say that? Because I
know from having talked to the indi-
viduals who found the information.
They knew that Hillary Clinton’s pri-
vate server was hacked by a foreign
country, and it was not Russia.
I knew at the time I was asking
Peter Strzok questions, but I didn’t
mention the country. But now it has
come out that a Chinese intelligence
agency had embedded instructions in
her private server that every email
coming in and every email going out
was to go to this Chinese intelligence
agency, and it happened.
We also now know there was classi-
fied information that came and went
through her private server.
But the inspector general for our in-
telligence community was so con-
cerned, he told his investigator, Frank
Rucker: Frank, you have got to get
over there and tell the FBI. They don’t
know that her private server was
hacked. You have got to go tell them.
This didn’t come out in the hearing.
I didn’t bring it up. But I did ask
Strzok, because we know from his pri-
vate texting that he was doing every-
thing he could to exonerate Hillary
Clinton and doing everything he could
to prevent Donald Trump from becom-
ing President.
So it had to come as an incredible
blow to Peter Strzok when the intel-
ligence community’s investigator,
their IG investigator, comes over to
the FBI, as directed by the IG, and he
has to tell Peter Strzok because he is
director of counterintelligence at the
FBI. And they have their liaison there,
Dean Chappell, and they have another
person there; and the IG also sent over
one of their top lawyers, Janet Mitch-
ell.
Rucker says: I needed to get you this
information, and you weren’t respond-
ing, so here it is. We now have proof
positive that Hillary Clinton’s private
server was hacked, and it was hacked
by China, and every email coming in,
going out is going to their intelligence
agency.
And this didn’t come out in the hear-
ing, but the fact is he was shocked at
the response by Peter Strzok, because
he just looked at him. He showed no
surprise. And Chappell and Strzok
thanked Frank Rucker for the informa-
tion, shook his hand, and sent him on
his way as if it were no big deal.
So where does Christopher Wray
come in there? After that came out
that our United States intelligence IG
had proof positive that Hillary Clin-
ton’s private server had been hacked
and after it was exposed what a det-

out that they were instructed that her
private server was hacked, what does
Christopher Wray’s FBI do? They re-
lease an official statement that the
FBI still has not seen any evidence
that Hillary Clinton’s private server
was hacked.
That was despicably dishonest. All
they had to do was contact the intel-
ligence community IG’s office. They
could have gotten the information.
But Christopher Wray was more in-
terested in trying to preserve the old
reputation of the FBI, so he continued
with the facade: Well, yeah, we put on
our blinders. We see no evil. We hear no
evil. We don’t know about any evil. We
are not going to go look at the evi-
dence that absolutely, unequivocally
shows her private server was hacked.
We will just ignorantly and inten-
tionally mislead the American people
and say we haven’t seen any evidence
that her private server was hacked.
b 1345
This is a dangerous, dangerous time
in our history. People can throw all the
rocks at Bill Barr. I didn’t know the
guy. I don’t think I ever met the man.
I had concerns because he was a private
friend of Bob Mueller, and his wife was
a friend of Mrs. Mueller. I had con-
cerns.
Now that he is trying to get to the
bottom of all the corruption within the
FBI and at the top of the DOJ, the
rocks are being hurled.
This should be a time when we come
together to try to root out the corrup-
tion. If they can attempt a coup of a
duly-elected President, whether you
like the electoral college or not, if they
can do it to a Republican, then the day
can come when we have conservative
people who disagree with a liberal
President and decide to take him out
the way they made so many inroads
into almost taking out Donald Trump.
This is a scary time in our history. I
literally hope and pray, and I know
there are people who make fun of the
prayers, but I truly believe prayers
have brought about God’s blessing on
this country.
We have a chance to fix things here,
but it is going to take courage by peo-
ple who are willing to stand up to an
FBI, some corruption at the top.
There are still some people at the
FBI who do not like Donald Trump.
They are still there. They still would
like to cover for people who were help-
ing try to effectuate this attempted
coup on Donald Trump. They need to
go.
It used to be—and I know person-
ally—assistant U.S. attorneys who
were career, or FBI agents who were
career. Most times, you don’t even
know how they voted. You don’t know
if they did vote because they had one
interest, getting to the truth of wheth-
er or not there was probable cause a
crime was committed and, if so, who
probably committed it. That gets them
an indictment, and then they can go
for a conviction. That is what they
were interested in, enforcing the law.
The FBI under Robert Mueller and
then James Comey became an instru-
ment to abuse enemies, and it has to be
cleaned up.
I have seen no indication that Chris-
topher Wray is interested in doing
that. He is covering for the guys who
created the problem. Maybe he is doing
some things internally that I am not
seeing, but he is not the answer.
For the sake of continuing this little
experiment in self-government, we
need to clean up the mess at the FBI in
Washington, D.C., and the mess that
still exists at the top of the Justice De-
partment. Then we can have a chance
to keep this little experiment of self-
government going.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

LEADING ON CLIMATE CHANGE
(Mr. CASTEN of Illinois asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
I rise to praise this body for passing
H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, of
which I am a proud cosponsor.
Climate change is the greatest exis-
tential threat to our species. It is also
an unequivocal economic opportunity.
Replacing the need to extract and burn
fossil fuels with renewable and clean
energy saves money.
This White House is failing to seize
this domestic opportunity while simul-
taneously walking away from our
international partners and competitors
that are committed to this challenge.
Of all the misguided decisions of this
administration, few have been as reck-
less as announcing our withdrawal
from the Paris climate agreement. It is
environmentally foolish; it is economi-
cally naive; and it cedes leadership to
China and others on the defining chal-
lenge of our time. That is foolhardy.
H.R. 9 is a reclamation of that man-
tle. It is a demonstration that Ameri-
cans are determined to lead, even if the
White House is refusing to do so.
I am proud to be a part of this effort,
not because it is enough, but because it
is the kind of leadership into the
breach that has long defined true
American greatness.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-

Let us pray.
Gracious God, You have blessed us
beyond our deserving, making our Na-

Day of Prayer, remind us that the ef-
fectual, fervent prayers of the right-
eous avail much.
Lord, transform our national leaders
into people of diligence, integrity, and
prayer. May they claim Your promise
in 2 Chronicles 7:14, that if they hum-
ble themselves, pray, repent, and seek
You earnestly, You will hear their
prayers, forgive their sins, and heal our
land. Help our Senators to continue to
seek You in prayer so that they may
learn how to embrace the unfolding of
Your loving providence.
Sovereign Lord, hear our prayer, for
we place our trust in You.
We pray in Your merciful Name.
Amen.

S.J. RES. 7
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in
March, the Senate narrowly passed a
resolution that would have misused the
War Powers Act and actually hampered
efforts to bring the conflict in Yemen
to a close. Fortunately, the President
vetoed it.
So today, Members will have a sec-
ond chance to send the right message
to our partners in the region, to impor-
tant humanitarian missions, and to
eradicating al-Qaida from the Arabian
Peninsula. I urge my colleagues to vote
to uphold the President’s veto.
The resolution before us starts from
false premises. We are not parties to
the civil war in Yemen. We are no
longer providing even air-to-air refuel-
ing.
More important, the resolution
would make it actually more difficult
to prevent the loss of innocent lives.
This resolution would require U.S. ad-
visers to cease training and intel-
ligence sharing operations that help pi-
lots avoid civilian casualties. And it
would dry up U.S. noncombat support
to the weakened, U.N.-recognized gov-
ernment in Yemen.
The resolution would also create seri-
ous new problems for the U.N.-led dip-
lomatic mission that is doing all it can
to negotiate an end to the bloodshed.
Abandoning our Yemeni, Emirati,
and Saudi partners just as diplomatic
efforts are starting to make progress is
hardly the way to give them the con-
fidence to take the hard diplomatic
steps that are necessary.
An abrupt withdrawal of U.S. support
for the coalition would be good news
for Iran, for the Houthi rebels they
support, and, of course, al-Qaida, as
well.
I share many of my colleagues’ seri-
ous concerns about aspects of Saudi
Arabia’s behavior, but the best way for
us to encourage better behavior from
our partners is to remain involved with
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, not push
them into the arms of Russia and
China.
The War Powers Act is a blunt tool,
and not at all the right vehicle to pro-
ductively or diplomatically express
concern about the behavior of close
partners of the United States.
The Senate passed a more nuanced
resolution in December of last year,
and it has many other tools to register
concern and disapproval. If Senators
want to play a productive role in this
conflict, I would encourage them to
meet with Saudi, Emirati, and Yemeni
officials, to travel to the region, and to
hold hearings on this important mat-
ter.
But for all the reasons I have laid
out, this particular resolution is a par-
ticularly bad idea. I urge each of my
colleagues to join me in setting it aside
and upholding the President’s veto.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, a
few weeks ago, a majority of the Sen-
ate took a modest step to revise some
of our institutional traditions and
process the President’s nominees for
lower level positions in a more fair and
expeditious manner. At the time, our
Democratic colleagues protested an-
grily. They had gladly supported a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2580 May 2, 2019
nearly identical procedural step in 2013
when it stood to benefit President
Obama. Now, with a different occupant
in the White House, apparently the
same principle just doesn’t apply.
They said their unprecedented delays
and obstruction were justified because
this administration’s nominees were so
controversial. They said there were le-
gitimate reasons why they had forced
cloture votes on 40-plus different posi-
tions for the first time in history and
wasted so much floor time.
My Democratic colleagues insisted
these were highly controversial people.
Well, Republicans knew better, so we
took the sensible step to expedite the
proceedings for these lower level nomi-
nations. It is time to take a look at
some of the individuals who have been
moving through under these new proce-
dures and how controversial they are.
This week alone, we have now con-
firmed the Energy Department’s gen-
eral counsel by a vote of 68 to 31; the
Director of the Pension Benefit Guar-
anty Corporation, 72 to 27; and an As-
sistant Secretary of State, 90 to 8. Yes-
terday afternoon, we advanced the
nominations of three district court
judges with 64 votes, 89 votes, and 94
votes. Obviously, they are really con-
troversial people we have been talking
about here.
We aren’t talking about lightning-
rod partisans here. These are abun-
dantly qualified, noncontroversial pub-
lic servants. They are the kinds who
used to go in big groups by voice vote.
The two leaders would put together
packages and voice vote them. Well,
our friends across the aisle aren’t let-
ting that happen.
Now we are beginning to make better
progress, nonetheless. Now that we are
finally able to get these people voted
on, our Democratic colleagues mostly
don’t oppose them. It would be almost
comical if it weren’t a sad reminder of
just how totally pointless the past 2
years of obstruction have been.
But it is also a hopeful sign as we
move forward. After studying and con-
sidering these nominees, the Senate
will keep on filling traditional vacan-
cies. We will keep confirming the
President’s team. We will keep giving
the American people the government
they actually voted for back in 2016.
f
MEDICARE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as I
have mentioned, there has been a re-
markable development this week in the
House. The Rules Committee held the
first hearing to discuss Medicare for
None. It was another demonstration of
how disconnected our Democratic col-
leagues’ agenda has become from the
best interests of working Americans
and middle-class families.
The last 2 years have been a case
study on how much American families
benefit when Republican policies get
out of the way. Helped along by tax re-
form, regulatory reform, and other ef-
forts, the country is seeing starkly low
unemployment, faster wage growth—
more opportunities for more families
to get ahead and build their lives.
Rather than admit the obvious, our
Democratic colleagues are choosing to
double and triple down on jacking
taxes back up and making families
cede a larger role for Washington in
their daily lives.
We have heard the pitch on
healthcare. They want to trade seniors’
Medicare and all private, employer-
sponsored health insurance plans for a
one-size-fits-all Federal plan and the
higher taxes needed to pay for it.
Just yesterday, a new report from
the CBO confirmed that such a scheme
would substantially increase Federal
spending and could lead to longer wait
times, worse quality of care, and a sys-
tem less responsive to patient needs.
On top of that, we know what our
Democratic colleagues tried to sell
families when it comes to the Green
New Deal: a Washington, DC, war on
our domestic energy that would cost
Americans their jobs, increase fami-
lies’ bills, forcibly change the homes
Americans are allowed to live in, in-
dustries they are allowed to work in,
and, of course, the cars they are al-
lowed to drive.
Let’s remember that all of this self-
inflicted economic pain would not real-
ly buy any meaningful gains in terms
of carbon emissions. For the better
part of the last decade, as U.S. emis-
sions actually declined—emissions
have been going down—our largest
competitors, like China, continued to
emit more and more.
Hog-tying the U.S. economy in the
name of further emissions reductions
would do nothing but give the largest
emitters license to keep on emitting
while poaching American jobs in the
process.
I don’t think real progress is actually
the point here. Facts are not the moti-
vating factor. My colleagues on the left
think these self-inflicted national inju-
ries just feel like this greening of
America is the right thing to do. They
just feel it.
Case in point, I understand that
House Democrats are planning to pass
a measure today that would try to
force the Trump administration to re-
main in the 2015 Paris Agreement on
greenhouse emissions. This is the big
international deal that the Obama ad-
ministration cheered on. It doesn’t
even pass the laugh test.
One expert analysis noted this week
that even a generous estimate puts the
impact of America’s participation on
global temperature reduction well
within the margin of error: One-hun-
dredth of 1 degree Celsius. In other
words, he points out, it is a completely
unmeasurable effect—tons of redtape
and real economic damage for zero
measurable effect. That is my friends
across the aisle in a nutshell on this
issue. Tie America’s own hands for no
benefit, while China and our other
international competitors go roaring
right by, all so a few pockets of high
society can pat themselves on the back
at the next cocktail party.
House Democrats may see this as ex-
citing political theater, but the mid-
dle-class Americans I represent give it
two thumbs down. So this futile ges-
ture to handcuff the U.S. economy
through the ill-fated Paris deal will go
nowhere here in the Senate. We are in
the business of actually helping mid-
dle-class families, not inventing new
obstacles to throw in their paths.

BARR HEARING
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Attor-
ney General Barr’s performance in yes-
terday’s Judiciary Committee hearing
was abysmal. It raised all types of
questions about his willingness to be a
faithful steward of the law. Of the sev-
eral outlandish claims, one stood out.
One of them should send shivers down
the spine of anyone who believes in
this democracy. It would probably send
shivers down the spines of the Found-
ing Fathers if they were to hear this
Attorney General say what he said. At-
torney General Barr said yesterday
that the President could not have ob-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2581
May 2, 2019
[If an investigation is] based on false alle-
gations, the president does not have to sit
there constitutionally and allow it to run its
course. The president could terminate that
proceeding and not have it be corrupt intent
because he was falsely accused.
What a statement. If the President
himself believes he has been falsely ac-
cused, he can terminate any investiga-
tion or proceeding against him. Any at
all? Is that the determination in the
President’s own head and in nobody
else’s? I am sending a letter to the At-
torney General this morning and am
asking him a whole bunch of questions
based on that awful, confounding state-
ment.
First, we know he had a theory of the
unitary executive. He issued that letter
before he was chosen as Attorney Gen-
eral, and many believe that is why he
was chosen. Yet this is the first time
he had stated it so crassly and so bald-
ly as Attorney General. Does he stand
by that or was it a mistake? That will
be my first question.
Does he stand by the statement that
he said yesterday, based on false alle-
gations, that the President does not
have to sit there constitutionally and
allow it to run its course? ‘‘The presi-
dent could terminate that proceeding
and not have it be corrupt intent be-
cause he was being falsely accused.’’ He
could terminate the proceeding. So
who is the determiner of what a false
allegation is? Is it the President him-
self solely? I am going to ask Attorney
General Barr that question.
What about other proceedings and in-
vestigations? Let’s say one of the
President’s family members is being
investigated. If the President deter-
mines that it is based on false allega-
tions, does he have the unilateral
power to terminate the proceeding?
What if it is one of the President’s
business associates, and the President
believes they are false allegations?
Does he have the ability to terminate?
What if it is one of his political allies?
Again, does he have the ability to ter-
minate?
I will also ask him: Does that mean
that Richard Nixon, who certainly be-
lieved he was falsely accused, could
have simply dismissed the entire Wa-
tergate investigation? Is that what the
Attorney General believes?
I mean, my God, what President
doesn’t believe he is being falsely ac-
cused? If this were to become the ac-
tual standard, then no President could
be guilty of obstructing a Federal in-
vestigation, and every President would
have the right to terminate any inves-
tigation—certainly, about that Presi-
dent and maybe about many others
who would have some relationship to
the President.
Attorney General Barr’s comments
are as close as they can get to saying
the President should be above the law.
So I will be writing him a letter and
sending it to him this morning, asking
him explicitly these questions and ask-
ing him if he stands by his statements.
If he does, he should not be Attorney
General. I will await his answers. I
hope he doesn’t stonewall as he has
been doing over in the House.
(Mrs. HYDE-SMITH assumed the
Chair.)
ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR AND THE MUELLER
REPORT
Madam President, on a related mat-
ter, one of the clearest takeaways from
yesterday’s hearing, in addition to the
Attorney General’s astounding state-
ment that the President could termi-
nate any investigation or procedure
against him if he believed it were based
on false facts, was the discrepancy be-
tween the Attorney General’s opinions
and the conclusions of the Mueller re-
port.
My colleague Senator HARRIS mas-
terfully also uncovered that the Attor-
ney General did not examine any of the
underlying evidence in the Mueller re-
port before making a prosecutorial de-
cision and, to his knowledge, neither
did the Deputy Attorney General. The
arrogance of these men is amazing.
This is one of the most serious issues
we face. At least half of the country be-
lieves it is very serious—more than
half. Yet they don’t even bother to
look at the underlying evidence before
they issue a statement that indicates
the President has been exonerated—at
least in the President’s own mind.
But that is to say nothing of the fact
that there are so many unanswered
questions about the reasoning behind
some of Special Counsel Mueller’s deci-
sions, regardless of what Barr thought
or did or wrote.
So it is imperative that Mueller
come to testify. The result is that we
have a gap. We have a gap of under-
standing of key details in the Mueller
probe—a gap that leaves a cloud hang-
ing over this country, over this Presi-
dent, over this Justice Department; a
gap that could easily be erased by hav-
ing the special counsel come to the
Senate and testify.
So I was frankly shocked, appalled—
I thought it wasn’t true; it must have
been a misquote—when I read on Twit-
ter that my friend the chairman,
LINDSEY GRAHAM, chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee, said that he would
not ask Mueller to testify, that he
would send Mueller a letter asking him
to respond if he disagreed with the At-
torney General’s testimony, but not in-
vite him to testify.
‘‘It is over,’’ he repeated to the com-
mittee and then to me on the floor
when I, really, confronted him, even
though he is my friend, because I was
so amazed about this—when I con-
fronted him here on the floor of the
Senate.
He modified his request after we
talked to say that if Mueller said that
he was misquoted, he could come. That
is not the way to do this.
Mueller should come—no ands, ifs, or
buts. The American people deserve it.
Frankly, my friend LINDSEY GRAHAM is
being totally derelict in his respon-
sibilities as chair of the Judiciary
Committee not to invite Mr. Mueller.
So I would ask LINDSEY GRAHAM to
reconsider, to think about the country,
to think about his long history of try-
ing to be fair and often—not so much
recently, but often—bipartisan. He is
someone I worked with, and he showed
great courage on immigration. He must
reconsider. He cannot have the Judici-
ary Committee simply be a political
arm of the President, which is where it
is devolving under his chairmanship.
Congressional oversight requires that
Mueller come. The Constitution, if you
read it, would indicate that it is per-
fectly within our ability and obligation
to bring Mueller here.
Please, Senator GRAHAM, reconsider.
Invite Mueller. His testimony is des-
perately needed to clarify what he ac-
tually meant and said after Mr. Barr’s
actions.
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE
Madam President, finally, on wom-
en’s healthcare, last month the Trump
administration proposed instituting a
radical title X gag rule, which would
have regulated the kinds of conversa-
tions women could have with their doc-
tors and risk cutting off family plan-
ning clinics from millions of dollars of
Federal funding.
The rule was set to go into effect on
May 3, but courts around the country
have granted preliminary injunctions
to prevent it from taking effect, as
they should.
Those decisions are great news and
should be celebrated as an affirmation
of a woman’s right to make her own
medical choices and not to have some
court, some judge, or some legislator
tell a woman what to do with her med-
ical choices.
But they are also a reminder that
President Trump and congressional Re-
publicans continue to undermine the
rights of women to make their own
healthcare decisions. Since taking of-
fice, President Trump and Republicans
across the country have launched an
assault on women’s reproductive free-
doms and women’s health. In Mis-
sissippi, in Georgia, and in Kentucky,
Republican statehouses are forcing
through radical proposals that would
dramatically limit women’s ability to
make their own choices.
Here in Washington, the Trump ad-
ministration continues to seek the
total destruction of our healthcare law.
Just yesterday the administration
issued a brief arguing that the entire
Affordable Care Act is unconstitu-
tional—an opinion that would gut pro-
tections for the 133 million Americans
with preexisting conditions and strip
away healthcare from millions of
American families.
The House has sent us a bill that
would protect people’s abilities who
have preexisting conditions to continue
to get insurance, but the Senate is not
acting, and that leads me to my last
point.
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Madam President, we have just con-
cluded another legislative week in the
Senate, but it was a legislative week in

name only. There was no legislation.
As you may have seen, we have done
little more than process nominations.
Later this afternoon, we will see
what the majority leader plans for next
week, but I have a suspicion—just more
nominations.
Meanwhile, there is no shortage of
legislation we could work on. The
House of Representatives has passed no
fewer than 100 pieces of legislation.
Guess how many of those 100 have re-
ceived consideration on the floor of the
Senate. Zero. Zero of the House-passed
bills on legislation.
Commonsense background checks,
voting rights, paycheck fairness, de-
fending protections for Americans with
preexisting conditions—all bipartisan,
all supported by the overwhelming ma-
jority of the American public, but in
the Senate there is no action—nothing.
We have become a conveyor belt for
nominations and a graveyard for legis-
lation.
I have said again and again to Leader
MCCONNELL that if he doesn’t like
every aspect of the House Democratic
bills, that is fine. That is democracy.
Let’s debate them. Let’s have amend-
ments.
If the leader truly wants to start
from scratch, we would love to hear his
plan. If he doesn’t think we should
close loopholes in our background
check system, then, what is his plan to
reduce gun violence and mass shoot-
ings?
He doesn’t like the Green New Deal—
fine. What is his plan to deal with cli-
mate change?
Before Leader MCCONNELL became
majority leader, he promised that if he
were in charge, he would do things dif-
ferently in the Senate. He would have
open debates, an open amendment
process. He would have us vote on the
issues of the day, no matter which
party the ideas come from.
Eventually, the American people are
going to take a hard look at this ob-
structionist Republican majority of the
116th Congress and wonder what the
heck we did with our time. When they
realize that the Republican Senate has
spent nearly all of its time so far
rubberstamping nominees—so many of
whom are unqualified and so many of
whose views, whether they be judicial
or executive appointments, are so far
out of the American mainstream and
ignoring real legislation that could
help middle class families—I wouldn’t
blame them for wanting to change the
leadership of the Senate.
I yield the floor.

S.J. RES. 7
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, in
the United States, American foreign
policy is not determined by just one
person. The Constitution makes that
clear. Article I grants Congress the
power to declare war, not the Presi-
dent.
Consistent with that responsibility,
Democrats and Republicans in this
body worked together to pass a bipar-
tisan resolution directing the Presi-
dent to end U.S. support for Saudi-led
hostilities in Yemen. I am a proud co-
sponsor of that bill, which passed both
Chambers of Congress in recent
months.
We made it unmistakably clear that
our involvement in Yemen is not au-
thorized by Congress, but the President
has chosen to sidestep the bipartisan
majority by not signing this bill into
law.
In doing so, he is sustaining the cri-
sis through the continuing refueling of
Saudi aircraft and other activities.
The American people are not asking
the President for this. Taxpayers, cer-
tainly, do not want to pay for it.
I serve on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, and I can assure you that
supporting Saudi Arabia’s operations
in Yemen is nowhere—nowhere—to be
found in our national defense strategy.
I urge my colleagues to reject contin-
ued support for Saudi Arabia’s military
actions in Yemen. Congress must do its
job and vote to override the President’s
veto.
We have an opportunity this week to
help make the suffering in Yemen
come to an end. Let’s not forget that 22
million people in Yemen still need hu-
manitarian assistance or protection.
More than 8 million people still go hun-
gry every single day. Sixteen million
Yemenis still don’t have clean water,
resulting in pervasive disease out-
breaks. Children are still dying every
single day. Every 10 minutes, a child
under 5 dies in Yemen from a prevent-
able cause, according to the United Na-
tions.
For many people, their survival is a
daily challenge and struggle. Their fu-
ture hangs, literally, by a thread.
In addition to disease, starvation,
and displacement, the people of Yemen
are subjected to indiscriminate bomb-
ings led by Saudi Arabia.
Let me be clear. Bombs will not re-
solve this conflict. All parties must
come together and work toward a
peaceful solution that places the dig-
nity of all Yemeni people at the center
of those negotiations, and we can help
facilitate that. That is what the Amer-
ican people want.
If you go to Michigan, you can meet
with some of the Yemeni Americans
who just want the same thing that ev-
erybody else does—help for those who
are suffering and meaningful steps to-
ward peace.
American diplomacy can help to re-
solve this tragedy, and we must make
every effort to do so.
I yield the floor.

jority whip.
REMEMBERING RICHARD LUGAR
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the
country lost one of its elder statesmen
this week with the death of former
Senator Richard Lugar.
As Members of Congress, one of the
most important parts of our job is
keeping our Nation secure. We only
hope that when we leave Congress, we
will have left our Nation a little safer
than when we found it.
Richard Lugar never had to wonder if
he had done that. As the Soviet Union
was collapsing, Dick stepped forward
and shepherded the passage of the
Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduc-
tion Program, which supported the dis-
mantling and decommissioning of nu-
clear weapons in former Soviet coun-
tries before the weapons could fall into
the hands of terrorists or rogue na-
tions.
As a direct result of his efforts, over
the years, thousands of weapons have
been destroyed—from warheads to mis-
siles to chemical weapons. Thanks to
his work, our Nation and our world are
more secure.
Dick’s achievements on global secu-
rity are the kind of legacy most of us
can only hope to have, but, of course,
that is not all that Dick Lugar did in
his Senate career.
As Indiana’s longest serving Senator,
he also served as a leader on agricul-
tural issues and on food security. Even
after he had left the Senate, he contin-
ued to advocate for the issues that he
cared about as president of the Lugar
Center, which, among other things, fo-
cuses on global food security and pre-
venting the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction.
Dick will be sorely missed. My
thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily, particularly his wife, Char, and
their four sons, Mark, Bob, John, and
David.
TAX REFORM
Madam President, over the Easter
break, I got to visit a number of South
Dakota businesses, like Persona Signs
in Madison and Energy Dynamics in
Carthage.
Visiting with South Dakotans is the
best part of my job, and it is the best
way to learn how government policies
are affecting South Dakotans and what
South Dakotans need from Wash-
ington.
One thing that has been wonderful to
see over the past year is how tax re-
form is benefiting South Dakota busi-
nesses. Businesses are benefiting di-
rectly from things like rate cuts and
enhanced expensing, and they are also
benefitting from the economic growth
that tax reform has helped produce.
I was excited to see that DeGeest
Steel Works in Tea, Valley Queen
Cheese in Milbank, and Royal Canin
pet food in North Sioux City are all in
the process of expanding.
Tax reform was a huge step forward
in creating an economy where busi-
nesses can grow, expand, and create
jobs, but there is more work to be done
to ensure that South Dakota busi-
nesses have all the resources they need
to thrive.
One big priority for Republicans is
passing the United States-Mexico-Can-
ada free trade agreement, which would
help to grow our economy, raise wages,
and create 176,000 new jobs. Canada and
Mexico are top markets for U.S. agri-
cultural products, and South Dakota

farmers, ranchers, and businesses
would all see benefits from the passage
of this agreement.
We also want to conclude an agree-
ment with China, which would provide
a boost to South Dakota soybean farm-
ers, as well as other South Dakota
businesses.
South Dakota farms and businesses
depend upon trade, and I am com-
mitted to making sure that they have
access to the markets they need.
With our thriving economy and low
unemployment, finding qualified work-
ers is a challenge for businesses nation-
wide, but it is particularly a challenge
in our State. Unemployment in South
Dakota is a remarkably low 2.8 per-
cent—a full percentage point lower
than the current measurement for the
United States as a whole.
While a low unemployment rate is
generally a good thing, it can make it
extremely difficult for South Dakota
businesses to find the workers they
need. That is why I have made expand-
ing the H–2B Visa Program a priority.
Many South Dakota businesses rely
on workers who temporarily come to
the United States through this pro-
gram. I was very pleased that the
Homeland Security Secretary granted
the request of a number of Senators,
including myself, to issue additional
H2–B visas for 2019. I will continue to
encourage the Department of Home-
land Security to expedite the release of
these visas.
I have also introduced legislation
that would expand the number of H–2B
visas available for States, including
South Dakota, with unemployment
rates at or below 3.5 percent.
Another way to ensure businesses
have qualified workers is to expand ac-
cess to career and technical education.
Career and technical education pro-
grams are key to expanding oppor-
tunity for American workers and giv-
ing them the skills they need to suc-
ceed in the 21st century economy. Last
year, Congress passed the Strength-
ening Career and Technical Education
for the 21st Century Act. This law gives
States greater flexibility over career
and technical education programs and
will help provide better access to train-
ing for more than 11 million students
and workers.
In addition, the Senate Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee
is currently working on a reauthoriza-
tion of the Higher Education Act,
which will also address career and
technical education.
Republicans are committed to con-
tinuing to expand opportunity for
America’s workers. Here in Wash-
ington, we can do a lot to help our
economy by getting government out of
the way, making sure that small and
larger businesses aren’t weighed down
with heavy taxes or excessive regula-
tions, but ultimately it is American
business men and women who are the
real drivers of growth.
People like the four generations of
Meyers, who have worked at A.H.
Meyer & Sons in Winfred, SD, sup-
porting the South Dakota beekeeping
industry or the three generations of
the DeGeests, who have worked at
DeGeest Steel in Tea. The energy, in-
novation, and commitment displayed
by businesses like these is what powers
America.
I am grateful to all the businesses
who took the time to talk with me and
to show me around over the past few
weeks and throughout the year. I will
continue to fight for those businesses
here in Washington, DC, and I look for-
ward to seeing more of the great work
that they will continue to do in the fu-
ture.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York.
S. RES. 120
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to add my name to S. Res.
120. This resolution would make it the
sense of the Senate that we in this
Chamber oppose the global BDS move-
ment and other efforts to delegitimize
the State of Israel.
I have long said that the boycott, di-
vestment, and sanctions movement
targeting Israel—the BDS movement—
is too often used as a vehicle for anti-
Semitism.
The resolution would affirm our com-
mitment to a two-state solution in the
Middle East, with a future viable,
democratic Palestinian State living
side by side with the democratic State
of Israel in peace, in security, and with
mutual recognition.
It would make clear that particularly
in this climate of increased anti-Semi-
tism, we do not agree with efforts to
delegitimize the State of Israel. I agree
with these principles, and it is why I
am supporting this resolution.
I would also like to say this: I have
made it clear in the past, and my opin-
ion is no different today, that I will not
support any legislation that will weak-
en Americans’ First Amendment
rights. In this country, we have a fun-
damental constitutional right to ex-
press our opinions and speak out about
what we believe in. We have a right to
engage in civil disobedience. We have a
right to protest. This resolution recog-
nizes all of that. It recognizes the right
of people to protest and express their
opinions about whatever country or
whatever policy they want, but the
Senate is also entitled to our opinion,
and I support making it our opinion in
this body that we oppose the global
BDS movement, that we want a two-
state solution, and that we want to
stand by our alliance with Israel.
I am proud to stand up for these
ideals. I am proud to speak out about
them. I encourage all New Yorkers and
all Americans all over the country to
keep speaking out what they believe in
too.
I also want to make a broader and
critically important point here; that is,
today we cannot ignore the anti-Semi-
tism that is on the rise all around us.
It is more important now than ever
that we stand together against all
forms of anti-Semitism.
Just this past weekend, a hateful,
anti-Semitic White supremacist
walked into a synagogue in California
on the Sabbath, during a celebration,
and horrifically opened fire with a
weapon of war on people who were
praying—praying—on the last day of
Passover. Six months before that, we
mourned the tragedy at the Tree of
Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, when an-
other hateful, anti-Semitic White su-
premacist walked into a synagogue on
the Sabbath and slaughtered people
with another weapon of war.
New Yorkers in my home State have
had to endure hateful graffiti with
swastikas and even outright physical
attacks. The FBI has reported a spike
in hate crimes all over our country, so
has the Anti-Defamation League.
The ADL just released its annual
audit of anti-Semitic incidents. These
cases of harassment, vandalism, and
assault aren’t just happening in one
place; they are happening in people’s
businesses, in their schools, in their
cemeteries, in their synagogues, and in
our public parks. It was their third
highest year on record. They are not
just happening in our country either.
In Europe, far-right political parties
are winning elected office. We are see-
ing new attempts to deny the Holo-
caust. It is all unacceptable. Given the
rise of anti-Semitism, it is particularly
concerning to me that the U.N. is so fo-
cused on continuously and singularly
vilifying Israel, in contrast to all other
nations. That is why I have taken so
many steps so often to call out the
U.N.’s unfair actions, and it is why I
will continue to call on the U.N. to ab-
stain from its unfair treatment of
Israel.
The United States is supposed to be a
safe haven for Israel and a safe haven
for the Jewish people. It is supposed to
be a safe haven for people of all reli-
gions. You are supposed to be able to
worship freely here and to honor the
Sabbath here without coming under at-
tack. We must never let that change.
We must not allow bigotry and vio-
lence to become normal and routine.
We must not look the other way when
we hear slurs and witness harassment.
Anti-Semitism is real and dangerous,
but it is not going to stop on its own.
Only our words and our actions can do
that. We need to show the world that
we are more united than ever to fight
against anti-Semitism and against all
other forms of racism and bigotry. We
need to send a powerful message of sol-
idarity by standing with the Jewish
community, praying with them, and
helping assure them that in this dark
moment, they are not alone.
Let me end with this. I take my faith
very seriously. It grounds me. I am
grateful that I have the opportunity to
attend Bible studies with my col-
leagues in the Senate and that I can at-
tend a weekly Prayer Breakfast. I be-
lieve we are here now, at this moment,
for a reason. We are all called to end

TRIBUTE TO BRUCE D. BENSON
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President,
today I come to the floor to celebrate
the life and career of Bruce Davey Ben-
son or, as so many people know, Bruce
D. Benson or, to all of us, just Bruce.
I first met Bruce Benson in 1994. Now,
he will not remember this at all, but I
remember that I was a young college
student at Colorado State University.
We were in the parking lot before a
game. I had the incredible honor of
being one of the chosen ones to take
the ram, our mascot, around the foot-
ball team at the football game before
sporting events throughout Colorado
State University.
I remember, in 1994, when the cam-
paign for Governor began, Bruce Ben-
son threw his hat in the ring to run
against Roy Romer. He was working
the crowd at this Colorado State foot-
ball game, and he came up to those of
us who were the ram handlers that
were with the mascot, shook our hands,
and introduced himself. So from that
moment, the first chance I got to meet
Bruce Benson in 1994, I knew it was
going to be an incredible opportunity
and relationship that would lead into
years of public service for myself be-
cause of how incredible his public serv-
ice had been to the State of Colorado
and the legacy he built.
This July, Bruce will be retiring as
the president of the University of Colo-
rado system, which currently oversees
four campuses in Colorado: the Univer-
sity of Colorado Denver, CU Colorado
Springs, the University of Colorado
Anschutz Medical Campus, and the CU
Boulder campus—the campus where I
earned my law degree.
He has a long history of bettering the
lives of Coloradoans. Prior to his ap-
pointment as president of the Univer-
sity of Colorado, Bruce established
himself in business, philanthropy, poli-
tics, and education.
Bruce graduated from the University
of Colorado in 1964 with a bachelor of
arts in geology and founded the Benson
Mineral Group. This is a great story of
somebody pulling themselves up by
their own bootstraps—taking the edu-
cation he was able to earn himself and
using it to build an incredible life of
opportunity for his family and the peo-
ple of Colorado. What started out as a
$6,000 drilling rig on the back of his
truck turned into a hugely successful
operation, with a reach extending into
banking, real estate, and even cable
television.
Bruce prioritized his community and
the education of others within it. Over
the next 20 years, he would serve on the
Colorado Commission of Higher Edu-
cation, the board of trustees for the
Metro State College of Denver, P–20
Education Coordinating Council, and
the Governor’s Blue Ribbon Panel for
Higher Education for the 21st Century,
all of which he chaired at one point.
He was involved in Colorado politics,
serving as the chair for the Colorado
Republican Party, helping to identify
candidates and being an instrumental
part in candidates’ campaigns over
many decades.
Bruce was appointed to the board of
directors for the National Park Foun-
dation and served on the National En-
dowment for the Humanities—a posi-
tion that required his confirmation
right here in front of the U.S. Senate.
I remember the work he did on edu-
cation issues—lobbying other Senators,
fighting for Colorado dollars, fighting
for policies that would help better Chil-
dren’s Hospital in Colorado, and fight-
ing for more funding for children’s
healthcare. After nearly 45 years in
business in Colorado, Bruce was in-
ducted into the Colorado Business Hall
of Fame in 2009.
There is a saying about President
Franklin Roosevelt, FDR. One time
when somebody was asked if they knew
President Roosevelt, they said no, but
they felt President Roosevelt knew
them. I think that saying can be ap-
plied to Bruce Benson because even if
you didn’t know him or don’t know
him in Colorado, odds are, if you are a
Coloradan, he has had a positive im-
pact on your life. He welcomed diver-
sity in the classroom, not only in back-
ground but also in thought. He never
wanted the university to teach people
what to think; he wanted the univer-
sity to teach them how to think. Bruce
learned long ago that he didn’t know
everything, but if you surround your-
self with the best, the rest will follow.
A lot has changed over the last 10
years of his leadership, and so has the
university and the State we both call
home. We don’t know where we would
be today without Bruce’s fierce work
ethic and drive to educate those around
him, but we know the future wouldn’t
be nearly as bright. For all this and so
much more, we owe him a great many
thanks.
To President Benson, thank you for
your service to our great State of Colo-
rado, and thank you for your friend-
ship.

Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
FISCHER). The Senator from Arkansas.
NATO
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President,
the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion turned 70 last month. Congres-
sional leaders invited NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg to deliver an
address before a joint meeting of Con-
gress to mark the historic occasion.
The Secretary General began his
speech with a vivid description of two
monuments outside of the organiza-
tion’s headquarters in Belgium—one, a
piece of the Berlin Wall and the other,
a twisted steel beam from the north
tower of the World Trade Center. Both
serve a special purpose as powerful re-
minders for NATO members of where
we have been and are going and our
commitment to one another.
The United States and our trans-
atlantic allies have seen the world
change considerably during the seven
decades of NATO’s existence. The
threat posed by the Soviet Union—one
of the main reasons the alliance was
formed—no longer exists, but the chal-
lenge of an increasing and hostile Rus-
sia has now taken its place.
Since Russia illegally annexed Cri-
mea in 2014, Vladimir Putin has
stepped up his acts of aggression by
arming pro-Russia rebels in Ukraine,
carrying out bombing campaigns on be-
half of a murderous regime in Syria,
and conducting cyber attacks on West-
ern democracies.
Russia continues to seize land and
expand its presence in Georgia, ille-
gally occupying roughly 20 percent of
Georgia’s internationally recognized
territory. On top of this, Russia has de-
ployed mobile, nuclear-capable missiles
in Europe. This clear violation of the
INF Treaty will have long-term rami-
fications for NATO countries.
As the Secretary General stated in
his joint session address, ‘‘an agree-
ment that is only respected by one side
will not keep us safe.’’ We don’t have
to return to a Cold War era arms race
as a result of Russia’s actions. How-
ever, as Secretary General Stoltenberg
noted, we must ‘‘prepare for a world
without the INF Treaty and take the
necessary steps to provide credible and
effective deterrence.’’
While the threat posed by a resurgent
Russia reinforces the need for a strong
NATO, it is far from the only concern
facing the alliance. China’s expanding
global influence and the aspirations of
smaller rogue nations, like North
Korea and Iran, will continue to chal-
lenge the West moving forward.
Additionally, while we have made
great strides to eliminate ISIS on the
battlefield, the threat posed by radical
Islamic terrorists remains ever present
and knows no boundaries.
The horrific Easter Sunday attacks
in Sri Lanka have been linked to the
terror group, proving that it clearly
continues to export its tactics and re-
cruitment well beyond Syria and Iraq.
There is no doubt that Western de-
mocracies remain squarely on ISIS’s
target list. In fact, the propaganda arm
of ISIS just released a video of the
group’s leader, where he makes that
threat abundantly clear.
Amid all of these challenges, NATO
stands as a very visible deterrent.
When half of the world’s military
stands together, bad actors take no-
tice. Collectively, NATO members also
make up half of the world’s economic

might. The prosperity of NATO mem-
bers makes the alliance that much
stronger. With that prosperity, how-
ever, comes responsibility.
The strength of NATO is contingent
on each other and every member pay-
ing its fair share. Every member nation
must meet the agreed-upon defense
spending levels. Secretary General
Stoltenberg stressed this point during
his address, and this message has
begun to resonate with NATO mem-
bers. An additional $41 billion has been
spent on defense by our European allies
and Canada in the last 2 years alone.
That number is expected to reach $100
billion—$100 billion—by the end of the
year.
President Trump deserves credit for
bringing about this sea change. His
words to allies not living up to their
commitments were conveyed in a very
direct manner. NATO must be a fair al-
liance. The President’s tough-love mes-
sage has worked. The majority of our
NATO allies have pledged to meet their
financial obligations by 2024. The
United States has been and must con-
tinue to be a strong example in this re-
gard.
This is an important point to remem-
ber as we fulfill our funding obligations
for fiscal year 2020. We must build on
the progress we have made in recent
years to end the chronic uncertainty
that has negatively impacted our mili-
tary readiness for far too long.
The Trump administration and
Congress’s shared commitment to our
national security has helped to renew
America’s strength and given a blue-
print to our NATO allies for how they,
too, can help achieve their share of our
common defense.
Congress has ushered through the
largest investment in our national de-
fense since the Reagan administration,
and President Trump has initiated the
modernization of our nuclear arsenal
and a national strategy for missile de-
fense. These were not easy lifts, but
the United States has made them all
happen. Our allies can as well.
We have accomplished a great deal
together in the past, but many chal-
lenges remain for NATO in the future.
As we mark the 70th year of the alli-
ance, we do so with the knowledge that
our friends from across the Atlantic
will continue to be trusted partners
who stand by each other in our hours of
need.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I thank my colleague for his com-
ments in support of NATO and the alli-
ance, one that we share on a bipartisan
basis here in the Senate.
REMEMBERING RICHARD LUGAR
Madam President, I wish to take a
few moments to honor former Senator
Richard Lugar, who passed away on
April 28.
Richard Lugar’s leadership as chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee was a model of statesman-
ship—someone who put country over
party and principle over politics.
I did not have the privilege of serving
as a Senator with Richard Lugar, but I
did have an opportunity to see him in
action when I served as a Senate staff
member, working on national security
issues for another great Senator and
statesman, Senator Mac Mathias, who
also served on the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee.
During that time, I witnessed Rich-
ard Lugar’s work on a bipartisan basis
to achieve major foreign policy suc-
cesses. He had the vision to remain
true to American values, and in a com-
plex world, he took the long view of
what was best for our country. Those
traits produced the landmark law to
reduce the threat of nuclear prolifera-
tion, known as the Nunn-Lugar Act,
after its chief authors. The program
has led to the elimination of more than
10,000 nuclear warheads, more than
1,000 ICBMs, and almost 40,000 tons of
chemical agents that had been scat-
tered across the former Soviet Union.
I was especially inspired by Senator
Lugar’s work to end the racist apart-
heid regime in South Africa. At the
time, the Reagan administration was
pursuing a policy of so-called ‘‘con-
structive engagement’’ with that
apartheid regime. The Reagan adminis-
tration was opposed to imposing sanc-
tions on South Africa to help free Nel-
son Mandela, who was imprisoned, and
to bring about an end to apartheid
rule. Senator Lugar understood that
continued engagement with that re-
gime undermined America’s values and
our interests. As chairman of the For-
eign Relations Committee, he led the
efforts to pass the legislation to impose
sanctions on South Africa, and when
President Reagan vetoed that bill, Sen-
ator Lugar lead the bipartisan effort to
overturn the veto of the President of
his own party. That override was suc-
cessful. Richard Lugar spurned par-
tisanship in order to do the right thing
for America.
S.J. RES. 7
Madam President, that brings us to
the vote we will have today—whether
or not to override President Trump’s
veto of the bipartisan legislation to
end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s
brutal actions in the catastrophic war
in Yemen.
I see Senator MURPHY, a colleague
from Connecticut, on the floor. I thank
him for his leadership in this area.
I urge the Senate to stand up to-
gether for American values and for our
long-term interests and to vote today
to overturn President Trump’s veto.
Whether it is Saudi Arabia’s conduct
in the war in Yemen, their grizzly mur-
der of American resident and Wash-
ington Post columnist Jamal
Khashoggi, their imprisonment of U.S.
citizens, or their gross violations of
basic human rights, the United States
must reevaluate and reshape our rela-
tionship with Saudi Arabia.
Let’s look at Yemen. The Crown
Prince has recklessly directed a brutal
war in Yemen for 5 years. That war has
resulted in the world’s largest humani-
tarian catastrophe. More than 100,000
civilians have been killed, and millions
more are on the brink of starvation.
More than 100 children die every day
from extreme hunger there.
In fact, the United Nations has called
the war in Yemen one of the ‘‘greatest
preventable disasters facing human-
ity.’’ Even after waging this brutal
war, the result has been that the Ira-
nian-backed Houthis are more en-
trenched and more militarily sophisti-
cated today than they were at the start
of this catastrophe, and Iranian influ-
ence in the region has expanded.
In short, the Crown Prince’s and
Saudi Arabia’s military adventurism
has been a major strategic blunder. So
rather than vetoing the bipartisan leg-
islation from Congress, the President’s
administration should be working over-
time to help resolve the conflict and
bring a negotiated end to that catas-
trophe.
I mentioned the vile and brutal mur-
der of Jamal Khashoggi, who was a
U.S. resident and a Washington Post
columnist. Yet President Trump threw
his own intelligence community under
the bus when it came to the question of
whether the Crown Prince had been
complicit in the murder of Khashoggi
in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. It
was the assessment of CIA Director
Gina Haspel and others who said that
the Crown Prince had been complicit in
that murder. Yet President Trump
said: ‘‘Maybe he did and maybe he
didn’t,’’ and dismissed the whole thing.
When the United States dismisses a
CIA determination that the Crown
Prince is responsible for the brutal
killing and murder of an American
resident, and we do nothing, that sends
an awful signal around the world that
puts Americans everywhere in danger.
Then, of course, we have seen just re-
cently the terrible crackdown with re-
spect to human rights violations in
Saudi Arabia. In fact, just a week ago,
Saudi Arabia beheaded 37 citizens,
most of them minority Shiites, in mass
executions across the country for al-
leged terrorism-related crimes, which
Amnesty International pointed out
were nothing more than sham trials
that relied on confessions extracted
through torture. Among those put to
death was a young man convicted for
reportedly attending a pro-democracy
rally during the Arab Spring when he
was just a teenager.
I have here a headline report: ‘‘Young
Man Set to Attend Western Michigan
University was Beheaded in Saudi Ara-
bia.’’ This was a man who was a teen-
ager, was part of a democracy move-
ment, and was imprisoned by the Saudi
authorities. He had been intending to
attend one of our American univer-
sities, and yet he was beheaded. You
also find that the Saudis are detaining
a number of American citizens, dual
nationals, for their activism on human
rights. They were seeking greater free-
dom for women in Saudi Arabia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2587
May 2, 2019
So rather than holding the Saudi re-
gime accountable, this administration
instead seems determined to move for-
ward, in a very secret way, with pro-
viding nuclear assistance to the Saudi
Government. They have talked about
providing the authority for U.S. com-
panies to engage in these conversa-
tions, even though Saudi leaders have
openly talked about acquiring nuclear
weapons and have raised the possibility
of dumping spent nuclear fuel from
their reactors on the border of neigh-
boring countries.
Instead of helping the Saudis with
their nuclear program and instead of
vetoing bipartisan legislation to hold
the Saudi Government and the Crown
Prince accountable, the President
should be actually reaching out on be-
half of American interests, but he
chose not to. He vetoed the bill. It is
now our duty, in a bipartisan way, to
stand up for American values and
American interests, and I urge this
Senate to vote to override the veto of
President Trump.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut.
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, let
me thank my colleague from Maryland
for outlining one of the cases for why
the override of the President’s veto is
so important.
There is no question that Saudi Ara-
bia has in no way moderated their
human rights behavior since the brutal
murder of Jamal Khashoggi. In fact, as
Senator VAN HOLLEN has rightly point-
ed out, the stick in America’s eye from
Riyadh has just gotten sharper. The
number of executions has increased.
More American citizens are being de-
tained. I didn’t catch it as to whether
Senator VAN HOLLEN specifically ref-
erenced the case of Dr. Fitaihi, a Har-
vard-trained physician who has alleg-
edly been tortured, including stripped
to his underwear and shocked with
electricity. He has been in detention
without charges or a trial for 11⁄2 years
after his arrest.
The Saudis’ behavior has gotten
more outrageous, has crossed more
human rights lines, has compromised
the safety of more American citizens,
and yet no response from the U.S. Con-
gress and not a single piece of legisla-
tion moving through the U.S. Senate
that would hold the Saudis accountable
for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and
now the detention of multiple U.S.
residents. We almost shut down our re-
lationship with Turkey over the de-
tainment of an American pastor, but
there is no similar response from this
body when it comes to the continued
detention of Americans in Saudi Ara-
bia, with no trial, with no charges, and
with evidence of torture. How is that?
How is that?
Today we specifically litigate the
case of the disastrous war that con-
tinues to rage inside Yemen today. I
want to read a very short excerpt writ-
ten by a hardened U.S. diplomat. Jef-
frey Feltman is not a Democrat or Re-
publican. He was a career Foreign
Service officer. He did some of the
toughest duty in the Middle East, in-
cluding a stint as our Ambassador to
Lebanon. Many people know him, and I
know he commands just as much re-
spect from Republicans as he does from
Democrats. Here is what he wrote. He
said:
The war in Yemen has been a disaster for
U.S. interests, for Saudi interests, and above
all for the Yemeni people. It has sparked the
world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe:
tens of thousands of civilians have been
killed, and 14 million are at risk of starva-
tion. It has been a strategic blunder as well,
producing the exact results the Saudi-led
military campaign was designed to prevent.
The Houthis are more militarily sophisti-
cated and better able to strike beyond Yem-
en’s borders than they were at the start of
the war; Iranian influence has expanded; and
the relationship between the Houthis and
Lebanon’s Hezbollah has only deepened. Al-
though the United Arab Emirates has waged
an effective battle against al Qaeda in
Yemen, terrorism remains a grave threat.
Now, I could read you similar pro-
nouncements from all sorts of other
Middle Eastern experts. There is a he-
gemony of opinion that this war has
been a disaster not just from a humani-
tarian standpoint.
I had to select a picture that, frank-
ly, wouldn’t induce sickness from my
colleagues. I chose a picture in which
this young, starving boy’s back is
turned to the camera, but there are
plenty others in which you would have
a hard time holding down your lunch.
It is not just the humanitarian night-
mare; it is the strategic nightmare
that is Yemen. Every single day that
we stay involved in this war, the battle
lines do not change, and yet Iran and
Hezbollah get more and more involved
inside the military fight.
There is a political deal to be had
here. If the United States chose to lead
diplomatically instead of follow mili-
tarily, there is a political deal that can
be had, but for reasons I do not under-
stand, the United States does not lead
the diplomatic negotiations. We
outsource that to the U.N. I am a big
fan of the U.N., but there is not going
to be a peace settlement in Yemen
without the United States as the lead.
Instead, we simply choose to follow the
military campaign of the Saudis by
helping them engage in a bombing
campaign that has murdered thousands
of civilians, either on purpose or by ac-
cident. It has destroyed the civilian in-
frastructure of the country, and it does
not relent.
Every single time you meet with
somebody from the administration,
they tell you: Well, it is getting better.
It is getting better. There is really no
evidence of that. On March 26, air-
strikes reportedly hit a hospital sup-
ported by Save the Children in north-
west Yemen, killing at least seven, in-
cluding four children. There is no ex-
cuse for that because every single hos-
pital is on the list of targets that the
Saudis can’t hit, and yet they continue
to do so.
Senator ROMNEY and I just came
back from the region, and here is what
we heard. All of the relief agencies that
do the big heavy lifting in Yemen flew
into Amman, Jordan, to talk to our
delegation. I thought it was excep-
tional that they were making this trip,
but then when they delivered the news
that they had, I understood why they
were making the trip into Jordan to
meet with us. The report they gave us
was absolutely bone-chilling.
I want you to listen to this. Today, in
Yemen, there are 250,000 Yemenis who
are so malnourished and so sick that
they are beyond saving. They will die.
One-quarter million Yemenis are so
sick, are so malnourished that they
cannot be saved, and another 10 million
are on the cusp of entering that cat-
egory. The only way to stop this hu-
manitarian disaster, of a scope and
scale that we see nowhere else in the
world, is to end this civil war.
So long as the United States partici-
pates in the military campaign with
the Saudis, while not offering any
meaningful pressure to get to a polit-
ical settlement, we are complicit in
those deaths. One-quarter million peo-
ple are going to die in the next several
months inside Yemen from starvation
and disease and malnutrition due to a
military campaign that we are a part
of. Don’t get me wrong. The Houthis
bear a great degree of responsibility for
those who are starving inside terri-
tories they control. There is still 15 to
20 percent of the relief supplies that
the Houthis steal and take for them-
selves, but hundreds of thousands of
those who are dying or who are subject
to disease and famine are in the parts
of the country that are controlled by
our coalition. This isn’t just a matter
of the Houthis refusing to let supplies
get to people who need them. There are
people dying in parts of the country
that the coalition, of which the United
States is a part of, controls, and we are
standing by, largely idly, as this devas-
tation continues.
I hope my colleagues will consider
voting to overturn the President’s
veto. I hope you will do it because it is
the only means by which we force a po-
litical settlement. I hope you will do it
because even if you don’t think that a
political settlement is coming, the
United States should never willingly be
a part of a bombing campaign that re-
sults in this kind of starvation. I hope
you will also do it because even if you
believe Iran is the No. 1 objective of
U.S. interest in the region or even if
you believe that al-Qaida and ISIS are
the No. 1 target of U.S. interest in the
region, they are getting stronger every
single day that the status quo con-
tinues.
The military campaign has been a
massive failure. The battle lines don’t
move, and al-Qaida and ISIS remain
uniquely strong inside that country be-
cause of the chaos, and Iran, every sin-
gle day, becomes more and more influ-
ential. Get out of the military cam-
paign, take the lead on the diplomatic
effort rather than simply follow others,
and we will end that misery. It is with-
in our power to send that message.

S2588 May 2, 2019
I agree with Senator VAN HOLLEN.
This is also about sending a message to
Saudi Arabia about the continued mur-
der and detainment of American citi-
zens and residents. This is about stand-
ing up for human rights in the face of
37 people convicted and beheaded inside
Saudi Arabia, several of them minors.
But this is also about squaring U.S.
policy with national security interests
and getting the blood off our hands as
250,000 Yemenis face certain death if we
don’t do something different very soon.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I
really want to thank Senator MURPHY
for his longstanding commitment to
this humanitarian need. We are now
just a Senate vote away from making a
major difference in regard to the hu-
manitarian crisis in Yemen, and every
Member of the Senate will now be on
record.
I want Senator MURPHY to know that
his work has been extremely important
and is well understood. What he is say-
ing I just really want to underscore;
that is, the U.S. military engagement
with Saudi Arabia and its partners is
counterproductive, not just to the hu-
manitarian crisis that exists today in
Yemen but to America’s national secu-
rity interests.
The conflict in Yemen has become a
humanitarian nightmare. At this point
our involvement does not advance the
interests of the United States, our
partners, or regional stability.
I recognize that we have a strategic
partnership with Saudi Arabia and that
we have a mutual desire to prevent the
expansion of Iranian influence and ter-
rorist groups that seek to do us harm.
However, our current military support
to Saudi Arabia in the Yemen conflict
has become detrimental to these
shared goals and our broader partner-
ship.
The suffering this conflict has caused
is beyond measure. More than 22 mil-
lion people, nearly 75 percent of the
population, are at grave risk. The
country has now seen the world’s larg-
est cholera outbreak, which has killed
thousands. Hunger and malnutrition
are threatening 2 million innocent
children under the age of 5. A recent
Save the Children report concluded
that some 85,000 children have already
died from starvation since the war
began. Morally continuing our military
involvement in this disaster simply
should not be an option.
I would also like my colleagues to
look beyond our direct support to the
role U.S. arms sales play in worsening
the conflict. These sales cannot come
at the expense of human rights, mass
atrocities, and regional destabilization.
Saudi Arabia has shown a disregard for
international law by inflicting dev-
astating losses on civilians, including
young children.
It is now well known that the Saudi-
led coalition targets civilian infra-
structure vital to Yemen’s recovery
and reconstruction. In fact, a recent
U.N. report concluded that the coali-
tion’s air campaign is the leading cause
of civilian casualties in Yemen, with 61
percent due to coalition air strikes.
Human Rights Watch, Amnesty Inter-
national, and Bellingcat have found
that U.S. weapons have been used in
these unlawful air strikes. There is evi-
dence that the coalition has used
banned and inherently indiscriminate
weapons like white phosphorus and
cluster bombs.
The military conflict has produced
staggering human rights abuses. The
AP, international organizations, and a
special expert group established by the
U.N. Human Rights Council have found
that all parties in the conflict have
committed grave violations of human
rights and the laws of war. Houthi war
crimes and abuses are staggering; how-
ever, reports indicate our supposed
partners have also engaged in horrific
abuses, including widespread torture
and sexual abuse at coalition-run se-
cret prisons.
For all of these reasons, it is impera-
tive that there is a speedy and peaceful
conclusion to the conflict in Yemen. It
is apparent that this will not come
from our military involvement. We
must, instead, focus our efforts on sup-
porting U.N.-led efforts to foster dia-
logue, a ceasefire, and humanitarian
access.
It is critical to prevent expansion of
the Iranian influence and extremist
groups in the region, but our military
involvement is not helping us in that
regard. Experts from across the ideo-
logical spectrum agree that the esca-
lation of the conflict has increased
Iran’s and extremist groups’ influence
in Yemen. Our military campaign is
counterproductive to our objective to
minimize the influence—and hopefully
eliminate the influence—of Iran and
extremist groups.
With all of these considerations in
mind, Republicans and Democrats in
the Senate and House of Representa-
tives came together to pass S.J. Res. 7.
For reasons that are still incomprehen-
sible to me, the President chose to veto
this resolution. Oxfam recently re-
sponded to this by stating that ‘‘the
people of Yemen and the parties to the
conflict are watching closely and the
messages US leaders send have the
power to save lives.’’
With a veto, they lose faith in the
United States and see the end to their
suffering a little further out of reach.
It is not, however, too late for Congress
to do the right thing. By overriding
this veto we assert this body’s author-
ity to support peace and human rights
while making America safer and more
secure.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. LEE. Madam President, over the
past few months, the Members of this
body and the Members of the U.S.
House of Representatives resoundingly
have voted in favor of S.J. Res. 7,
which would remove U.S. Armed
Forces from Saudi Arabia’s war in
Yemen. This unconstitutional, unjusti-
fied, and ultimately immoral war has
repeatedly come up over the last year,
and thankfully America’s elected law-
makers in Washington have taken a
stand against it.
The President has vetoed our resolu-
tion, but today we have the oppor-
tunity—and I believe we have the abso-
lute constitutional duty—to once again
take a stand on this important matter.
Today, we have the opportunity to
override the veto in pursuit of justice,
prudence, and upholding the constitu-
tionally mandated separation of pow-
ers. This is one of the most important,
fundamental features of our constitu-
tional system. Congress and Congress
alone may declare war. This is in direct
contrast to the way our old national
government—the one in London—
worked. Under that system, the chief
executive could take the country to
war, but not in America, not under our
system, not in the U.S. Constitution.
In fact, it is one of the distinguishing
characteristics pointed out in Fed-
eralist 69.
As we have already heard, the hu-
manitarian crisis in Yemen is dire, and
estimates show that the crisis is even
worse than we had previously thought.
The Yemen war has claimed the lives
of tens of thousands of people, includ-
ing a whole lot of innocent civilians in
attacks that can only be described as
horrific. It is believed that from 2016 to
2018, over 60,000 combatants and civil-
ians were killed in direct violence at-
tached to this war, but the full scale of
suffering from starvation, poverty, and
disease is even more staggering than
the stark numbers that I have just
quoted involving direct combat or di-
rect violence.
Over half of the population of Yemen
is considered currently to be in the cri-
sis stage of famine. An estimated 3.3
million children are malnourished, and
over 84,000 children have died just be-
tween the start of the war in 2015 and
October of 2018. Poor water and sanita-
tion conditions have also led to the
largest cholera outbreak in history,
with more than 1.3 million suspected
cases and over 2,600 related deaths
since the April 2017 outbreak.
Contrary to the claims of some of our
critics, the United States has, in fact,
been aiding and abetting the horrors of
this war. Indeed, these critics claim
that we have somehow not been in-
volved in a war in Yemen. But in
March of 2015, shortly after Saudi Ara-
bia launched its war against the
Houthi rebels, the Obama administra-
tion authorized U.S. military forces to
provide ‘‘logistical and intelligence
support’’ to the Saudi coalition. The

Obama administration provided this
authorization without any kind of ap-
proval from Congress. Since then, we
have helped the Saudis with surveil-
lance, reconnaissance and information,
target selection assistance, and, until
quite recently, with midair refueling,
including midair refueling involving
combat missions. In other words, we
have been materially assisting a for-
eign power in its efforts to bomb its ad-
versaries and sometimes helping that
foreign power to bomb innocent civil-
ians on the ground in the process.
Other opponents of our resolution
claim that our involvement in this
undeclared, unconstitutional, immoral
civil war half a world away in Yemen is
somehow constitutional, is somehow
statutorily authorized under the War
Powers Act of 1973, which authorizes
the executive branch to use Armed
Forces in cases of emergencies and
under certain limited time constraints.
The conflict in Yemen—a conflict be-
tween a regional rebel group on the one
hand and the Saudi-backed government
on the other hand—by no means con-
stitutes or in any way presents a
threat to the safety of American citi-
zens in the United States, and our in-
volvement has far surpassed the allot-
ment of any emergency time con-
straint contemplated under the war
powers resolution. Still others say that
we are not engaged in ‘‘hostilities’’
that constitute a conflict of war under
the War Powers Act. But these critics,
of course, are relying on an overly nar-
row and outdated definition from a 1976
memorandum—a memorandum, I
would add, internal to the executive
branch. In that respect, it is self-serv-
ing and one that does not include the
indisputably high-tech activities of war
today.
The way we fight wars today often
ends up involving cyber activity, re-
connaissance, surveillance, and target
selection—the precise activities we are
engaged in in this war in Yemen. Even
aside from that, under the War Powers
Act, we ourselves do not have to be in-
volved in hostilities. We don’t have to
establish that in order to trigger the
War Powers Act—that we are involved
in hostilities. The War Powers Act is
triggered so long as we are sufficiently
involved with the armed forces of an-
other nation, when they—those armed
forces of another nation—are them-
selves involved in hostilities. There
can be no doubt in our minds—not in
my mind, in your mind, not in the
mind of any American—that the Saudis
are engaged in hostilities in Yemen,
and we are helping them. So it is im-
material; it is completely inconsequen-
tial if you accept this crab, self-serv-
ing, narrow, outdated definition of the
word ‘‘hostilities’’ found in this 1976
Department of Defense memorandum.
Finally, some opponents of this ef-
fort, of this resolution to call for our
withdrawal from this undeclared, un-
constitutional, immoral war in Yemen,
are saying that removing U.S. forces
would somehow hurt our efforts to
combat terrorism in the region, specifi-
cally against al-Qaida and ISIS, and
would endanger the lives of American
citizens and soldiers. In the first place,
these critics are dangerously
conflating different geopolitical con-
flicts. The conflict in Yemen is a re-
gional, civil war. It is not about al-
Qaida. It is not about ISIS. Even if it
were, our resolution, S.J. Res. 7, the
one we are talking about today in the
context of a veto override debate—that
resolution explicitly states that it
would not impede the military’s ability
to fight these terror groups. Further-
more, there is evidence that our in-
volvement in Yemen might well have—
in fact, probably has—further desta-
bilized the region and that it has actu-
ally undermined the effort against al-
Qaida’s affiliates. A 2016 State Depart-
ment report found that the conflict be-
tween the Saudi-led forces and the
Houthi insurgents has actually helped
al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, also
known as AQAP, and ISIS’s Yemen
branch to ‘‘deepen their inroads across
much of the country.’’
So, no, involvement in Yemen is far
from being in the best interest of the
United States—not in the slightest, not
even by a shred. Every day it only be-
comes clearer and clearer that Saudi
Arabia is not an ally that deserves our
unwavering, unflinching, unquestion-
ing support and military intervention,
especially when our own security—the
security of the American people on
U.S. soil—is not on the line.
Last October, there was of course the
killing of Jamal Khashoggi. In Feb-
ruary, a report came out suggesting
that the United Arab Emirates have
actually transferred American-made
weapons to al-Qaida-linked fighters
and other military groups. In other
words, the Saudi-led coalition is pos-
sibly giving our own weapons, in viola-
tion of our own end user agreements
with them, to the very terrorist groups
we are trying to fight, the very ter-
rorist groups that opponents of this
resolution incorrectly suggest would
benefit from the passage of this resolu-
tion.
Just this past week, news surfaced
that the Saudis ruthlessly beheaded 37
men who were mainly minority Shia
Muslims, 5 of them gay men who were
suspected to have been tortured into a
confession. Perhaps we ought not be
supporting that regime at all. Perhaps
we ought not give unflinching, unwav-
ering, unquestioning devotion to a re-
gime that treats its own people that
way and that has harmed others in its
own region in the way that it has. At a
bare minimum, we should not be fight-
ing an unjust civil war on their behalf,
half a world away, without congres-
sional authorization.
Article I, section 8 of the Constitu-
tion unequivocally states that Con-
gress shall have the power to declare
war—Congress, not the President, not
the Pentagon, not someone else in the
executive branch, not some expert any-
where in the executive branch of gov-
ernment, but Congress. They did so.
They made it this way because they
understood that the decision about
whether to go to war is a decision
fraught with immense moral peril.
There is nothing pretty about war. It
always, when we face such a decision,
involves a decision to put American
treasure and American blood on the
line. Even if you think that with mod-
ern-day weaponry and/or the modern
way in which we fight wars—if you
think that American blood and treas-
ure is not being put on the line, that
simply isn’t true. That is exactly why
the Founding Fathers placed this
power in the legislative branch where
it can be exercised squarely in front of
the American people by their elected
Representatives. This power was al-
ways intended to be exercised only by
the branch of government most ac-
countable to the people at the most
regular intervals because of the moral
peril necessarily involved in any deci-
sion to go to war—moral peril involv-
ing the use of U.S. resources, the put-
ting on the line of American blood, and
also the moral peril that it creates
wherever we are going to war.
If you truly believe that our involve-
ment in Yemen is crucial to the safety
of American citizens and America’s
best interests generally, that is all the
more reason to debate it and discuss it
right here, right now. In fact, the Con-
stitution demands it. It already is the
law. We have to do this. If you are so
confident that we should be involved in
this war, let’s debate it. Let’s vote on
it. Let’s let the American people see
what we are about. Let’s let the Amer-
ican people have some say in the ex-
tent to which we put America’s good
name, its treasure, and its blood on the
line.
Today, we still have an opportunity
to have a say, to take a stand over this
most grave matter. I urge my col-
leagues to take it.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont.
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let
me thank Senator LEE and Senator
CHRIS MURPHY for their outstanding
and consistent leadership on this issue.
At a time when the country bemoans
the fact that there is not a lot of bipar-
tisanship, this effort indicates that
people with very different political phi-
losophies can come together on an
issue of enormous magnitude. I do
want to thank MIKE LEE for his great
work on this.
I rise today to speak in support of
overriding the President’s veto of S.J.
Res. 7. On April 16, despite telling us
that he is opposed to ‘‘endless wars,’’
President Trump used the second veto
of his Presidency to reject S.J. Res. 7,
which directs the removal of U.S.
Armed Forces from the Saudi-led inter-
vention in the Republic of Yemen, a
war that began 4 years ago. The vote

voting for it. The resolution passed the
House on April 4 by a bipartisan vote of
247 to 175.
The current situation in Yemen is
the worst humanitarian disaster on
Earth. In March of 2015, under the lead-
ership of Muhammad bin Salman—then
Saudi Arabian Defense Minister and
now the Crown Prince—a Saudi-led
intervention in Yemen’s ongoing civil
war took place.
According to the United Nations,
Yemen is at risk of the most severe
famine in more than 100 years, with
some 14 million people—this is a small,
poor country—some 14 million people
now face starvation as a result of this
war, this Saudi-led intervention we are
supporting.
According to the Save the Children
organization, some 85,000 children have
already starved to death, and millions
more face death if the war continues.
It gets much worse than that. A new
United Nations-commissioned report,
just published by the University of
Denver, states that the impact of this
war on civilians—particularly chil-
dren—is actually far more serious than
previously thought. If this war con-
tinues, the report estimates that by
the end of 2019, it will have taken the
lives of some 219,000 people in Yemen,
including 140,000 children under the age
of 5. According to this report, every 12
minutes, a Yemeni child is dying as a
result of this war.
The magnitude of the suffering in
that country is literally unimaginable.
We are talking about the possibility of
millions of people starving to death
and of hundreds of thousands of people
dying by the end of this year.
The fact is that the United States,
with relatively little media attention,
has been Saudi Arabia’s partner in this
horrific war. We have been providing
the bombs the Saudi-led coalition is
using. We have been refueling their
planes before they drop those bombs.
We have been assisting with intel-
ligence. In many cases, our weapons
are being used to kill women and chil-
dren.
Late last year, I met with several
brave Yemeni human rights activists.
They had come to urge Congress to put
a stop to this war, and they told me
clearly that when Yemenis see ‘‘Made
in the U.S.A.’’ on the bombs that are
killing them, it tells them that the
U.S.A. is responsible for this war, and
that is a sad and tragic truth.
The bottom line is that the United
States should not be supporting a cata-
strophic war led by a despotic regime
with a dangerous and irresponsible for-
eign policy.
Issue No. 1 is the horrific tragedy we
are contributing to in Yemen.
Issue No. 2 is equally important, and
that is that the involvement of the
United States in this war is clearly un-
constitutional.
I hear many of my Republican friends
claim they are strict constitutional-
ists. If you are a strict constitu-
tionalist, voting to override Trump’s
veto should be a no-brainer because
this war has not been authorized by
Congress. It is unconstitutional.
Let me remind my colleagues who
may have forgotten what is in the U.S.
Constitution. Article I, section 8 states
clearly that ‘‘Congress shall have
power to . . . declare war.’’ While the
President has the authority over the
conduct of war once it has been de-
clared, the Founding Fathers gave the
power to authorize military conflicts
to Congress—the branch most account-
able to the people. Under the War Pow-
ers Act of 1973, the assignment of a
member of the U.S. Armed Forces to
‘‘command, coordinate, participate in
the movement of, or accompany’’ an-
other country’s military during a war
constitutes the introduction of the
United States into a conflict. Our mili-
tary involvement in the war in Yemen,
which has included logistical and intel-
ligence support, as well as aerial re-
fueling of Saudi war planes, clearly
meets this definition.
For far too long, the Congress, under
both Democratic and Republican ad-
ministrations, has abdicated its con-
stitutional role with regard to the au-
thorization of war. The historic pas-
sage of this resolution—the first time
since the 1973 War Powers Resolution
was passed that it has been success-
fully used to withdraw the United
States from an unauthorized war—was
a long-overdue step by Congress to re-
assert its constitutional authority.
Finally, after years of abdicating
that responsibility, Congress stood up,
in the Senate and in the House, and
said: Mr. President, you do not have
the power to get U.S. troops involved
in a war that we did not vote upon. And
that is a big deal. Congress is finally
doing what the Constitution of the
United States mandates that it do.
Within a half hour or so, the Senate
must act to protect that constitutional
responsibility by overriding the Presi-
dent’s veto.
I respect that there are Members of
this body who voted against the initial
resolution and that you support U.S.
intervention in Yemen for one of a
number of reasons, and I respect your
point of view, but if you think the
United States should be involved in the
Saudi-led war in Yemen, bring that res-
olution to the floor of the Senate. Let’s
have that debate. You explain to the
American people why we should be
spending significant amounts of money
and putting American military lives in
danger and why you think it is a good
idea. Come to the floor—that is what
the Constitution says you should do—
and let us vote that issue up or down.
Maybe you win. Maybe you won’t win.
I think you won’t win, but maybe you
will. But let’s have that debate. What
is absolutely clear is that is the re-
sponsibility of the Senate and the
House, and the President alone cannot
decide when he wants to send American
troops into conflict.
The last point I want to make is that
this vote this afternoon must make
clear to Saudi Arabia that we will not
continue to follow their lead into disas-
trous military interventions. Let us be
very clear. Saudi Arabia is a despotic
dictatorship that works overtime to
prevent any movement in that country
toward democracy. That is a country
run by an incredibly wealthy family. I
think Muhammad bin Salman has the
distinction of owning both the largest
yacht and the largest house in the
world. They have endless wealth, and
now they are using their wealth and
power in a dangerous and irresponsible
military intervention.
Saudi Arabia is a nation that treats
women not as second-class citizens but
as third-class citizens. It is a nation
that 7 months ago murdered a jour-
nalist in cold blood in its own con-
sulate in Turkey and then dis-
membered his body. That was the sig-
nal to any dissident in Saudi Arabia
that if you dare speak out against the
royal family, that is what you have to
look forward to—getting killed in cold
blood and having your body dis-
membered. Dozens of people were re-
cently executed in Saudi Arabia be-
cause of their opposition to govern-
ment policy.
The word has to get out to the dicta-
torship in Saudi Arabia that, no, we
will not be following their lead and
their interventions in wars that are
only causing horrific pain in that re-
gion.
In my view, what we should be doing
in Yemen now is ending the bombing,
supporting a diplomatic solution to the
civil war there that finally brings
peace to that region, providing imme-
diate humanitarian aid, and helping
the people, along with the inter-
national community, to rebuild their
shattered economy, which is dysfunc-
tional today.
This is an important vote. It is an
important vote that says the people of
Yemen need humanitarian aid, not
more bombs. It is a vote that says the
Senate believes in the Constitution of
this country, which says that it is Con-
gress, not the President, that deter-
mines whether and when we go to war.
It is a vote that tells Saudi Arabia we
will not follow their lead in irrespon-
sible intervention.
I hope very much that the Members
of this body summon up their courage
and vote to override Trump’s veto.
I yield the floor.

I am disappointed but not surprised
that the President issued a veto, choos-
ing to stand by a campaign of dev-
astating consequences for the people of
Yemen. Every time we have a vote on
this resolution and every day, the num-
bers get worse, but let us be clear.
These numbers are people: 3 million
human beings have been forced to flee,
more than 15 million are on the brink
of starvation, and more than 1 million
individuals—children, mothers, fa-
thers—are suffering from the largest
cholera epidemic in the world.
Even the coalition countries them-
selves insist there is no military solu-
tion to this manmade conflict. As
Houthis, backed with destabilizing and
increasing support from Iran, continue
to launch attacks into civilian popu-
lation centers, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates continue their
campaign which has targeted hospitals
and threatened humanitarian access.
The fragile U.N.-brokered political
process that emerged from Stockholm
is almost at a breaking point. To be
sure, the Houthis slow-walking the im-
plementation of this plan presents a se-
rious challenge, but U.S. focus should
now be on supporting a meaningful, in-
clusive, and comprehensive process,
even if it is one step at a time—a proc-
ess that must start by ensuring that
vital humanitarian relief reaches those
who need it most desperately.
As some of my colleagues and the
President have repeated, we do indeed
have important security and military
partnerships with the countries com-
prising the coalition, but these part-
nerships are not a blank check for
weapons and direct support for a cam-
paign that is decidedly working against
U.S. interests in the region.
In addition to the truly horrific at-
tacks on civilians, we have credible,
alarming reports that our partners are
transferring U.S. weapons to nonstate
actors who have worked directly
against the United States. Moreover,
the length and brutality of this cam-
paign have allowed Iran to exploit a
vacuum and increase its influence and
presence in the gulf.
This resolution sends an important
message, but much work remains to be
done.
I have a bipartisan bill that would
authorize serious policy regarding U.S.
weapons sales, that would hold ac-
countable those blocking humanitarian
aid, and help set the stage for sup-
porting a meaningful political process.
As I have said before, we should con-
sider this resolution just as one step,
but one that must be taken, one that
the Congress has shown it supports.
While the President has made his de-
cision clear, the Congress must con-
tinue to assert our independence and
continue to act where he will not.
Finally, let me also repeat what I
said this morning at the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee business
meeting—the Executive has a responsi-
bility to share with us critical informa-
tion that is directly relevant to the
work of the committee.
Last month, I discovered intelligence
directly related to a topic that the ad-
ministration had regularly briefed the
committee about but completely omit-
ted. Without going into the details, I
called the administration to provide
committee members with more infor-
mation. I believe the full Senate should
have this information, which is rel-
evant to votes we have taken, and I
will be asking the majority and minor-
ity leaders to convene an all-Senators
briefing on this topic. I think they
should know before they cast votes.
I yield the floor.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise today in support of overriding
President Trump’s veto of the Sanders-
Murphy resolution.
The resolution would end U.S. in-
volvement in the war in Yemen, which
I believe is long overdue.
Saudi Arabia’s conduct in the war in
Yemen has been deplorable.
It has purposefully attacked civilian
infrastructure, including electricity
generation facilities, water sanitation
plants and, medical facilities. They
have employed cluster munitions in ci-
vilian areas and used disproportionate
force to attack military targets. In one
attack, the coalition killed more than
40 children on a school bus, claiming to
this day that the bus was a legitimate
military target.
While I am pleased that the United
States is no longer refueling coalition
aircraft, I support ending all U.S. as-
sistance for the Saudi-led coalition be-
fore thousands more die. To date, more
than 63,000 people have been killed as a
direct result of the conflict. If the con-
flict continues, an estimated 22,000
more people will be killed this year.
That is only direct combat deaths,
which is highly misleading. The ongo-
ing war, with U.S. support, has indi-
rectly killed far more, with Yemen’s
children bearing the brunt of the suf-
fering. Since 2014, more than 85,000
children have died of starvation. That
is worth repeating: More than 85,000
children have starved to death in the
last 4 years in Yemen.
By the end of 2019, the total number
of people in Yemen who will die from a
lack of food, health services, and infra-
structure is expected to top 131,000.
Sixty percent of those killed will be
children under the age of 5. In fact, a
child in Yemen will die every 12 min-
utes unless we end this war.
The Saudi coalition’s purposeful de-
struction of Yemen’s civilian infra-
structure, targeting of medical facili-
ties and withholding of aid has led to
the world’s worst humanitarian crisis:
14 million people require emergency
food aid. A majority of Yemen’s popu-
lation does not have access to clean
water, sanitation, or adequate public
healthcare. Cholera and other diseases
are rampant throughout Yemen as pub-
lic services have collapsed. There have
been 1.2 million suspected cases of
cholera, resulting in 2,500 fatalities
from this entirely preventable disease.
Nearly three-quarters of the popu-
lation—almost 22 million people—need
some form of humanitarian assistance.
Sadly, the actions of the Trump ad-
ministration have worsened the hu-
manitarian harm. Through the Presi-
dent’s ‘‘Muslim ban,’’ the administra-
tion has effectively trapped civilians in
Yemen, sealing their fate.
The Trump administration has not
accepted a single refugee from Yemen
since October 2017. It has banned per-
manent immigration from Yemen, in-
cluding immediate family members of
U.S. citizens, and it has stopped issuing
temporary visas. The Trump adminis-
tration has even refused to redesignate
Temporary Protected Status for
Yemen, making more than a thousand
protected Yemenis subject to deporta-
tion.
The United States can help end the
suffering in Yemen by halting all as-
sistance to the Saudi-led coalition. It
could also accept Yemeni refugees, re-
sume normal immigration and extend
TPS to Yemenis currently in the
United States. The Trump administra-
tion has callously decided to do noth-
ing.
The Sanders-Murphy resolution
would direct the President to end all
U.S. support for the war in Yemen.
Given the horrific consequences of the
conflict, I strongly supported the reso-
lution when it passed the Senate on
March 13, 2019.
I am disappointed but not surprised
by the President’s veto of it. The Presi-
dent’s apparent plan is to continue to
support the Saudi coalition even
though it is clear that there is no mili-
tary solution to this conflict. That is
unacceptable.
Unfortunately, the President’s un-
conditional support for Saudi Arabia is
not limited to its conduct in Yemen.
Under the direction of Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia
murdered, dismembered, and disposed
of the remains of a U.S. resident,
Jamal Khashoggi. To this day, the
Saudi Government continues to blame
‘‘rogue agents’’ for this heinous mur-
der. They are holding a secret trial for
the so-called accused, refusing to co-
operate with international investiga-
tions, and continuing to rely on the
Trump administration to shield it from
accountability.
Any nation that would murder a
journalist inside its own diplomatic fa-
cility is no friend of the United States.
Any leader who would direct another
human being to be dismembered with a
bone saw is not fit to lead.
Let’s be clear: Mohammed bin
Salman is responsible for Khashoggi’s
murder. He is not fit to lead the king-
dom and must be held accountable for
this crime.
Saudi Arabia has also arrested, tor-
tured and prosecuted peaceful political
activists, including women. It has kid-
napped and forcefully repatriated

Saudi nationals, executed religious mi-
norities, and even illegally detained
U.S. citizens.
The vote before us today would send
a clear message to Saudi Arabia that
we do not support its heinous policy
and actions.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
sending that message.
Mr. MENENDEZ. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, today we
begin to consider S.J. Res. 7, which is a
joint resolution that directs—and I
quote from the resolution—‘‘removal of
U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in
Yemen.’’
This is the second time, of course,
that we have considered this. We
passed it, the House passed it, and the
President has vetoed it, and it is now
in front of us, under our constitutional
responsibilities, to consider whether
the resolution becomes law, notwith-
standing the President’s signature.
I am going to urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on
this, that it does not become law, and
we sustain the veto the President has
made.
As I have stated before, the premise
of this resolution is fundamentally
flawed and I believe a
mischaracterization of the actual facts
on the ground today in Yemen.
I want to start basically by, once
again, making it absolutely clear what
is and, more importantly, what is not
happening with respect to U.S. engage-
ment in Yemen.
What isn’t happening is the injection
of U.S. troops into active hostilities in
the Yemen civil war. To put it simply,
our troops are not cobelligerents in
this conflict.
What we are doing, however, is pro-
viding limited noncombat support to
the Saudi-led coalition, including in-
telligence sharing and practices that
have been developed to minimize civil-
ian casualties—I am sure a goal every-
body in this body supports.
This support is very narrow in focus,
it is advisory in nature, and helps de-
fend the territorial integrity of Saudi
Arabia and the UAE, which both face a
very real threat from the Iranian-
backed Houthis and from Iran itself.
Our limited support is intended to pre-
vent the conflict in Yemen from esca-
lating.
Iran’s support for the Houthis, nota-
bly the transfer of missiles and other
weaponry, threatens to undermine our
partners’ territorial integrity, imperils
key shipping routes, and puts U.S. in-
terests at risk, including thousands of
U.S. personnel and citizens currently
within range of the Iranian-made mis-
sile systems under Houthi control.
This, of course, includes the airport in
Saudi Arabia, which many Members of
this body have used from time to time
when they go to codels in Saudi Ara-
bia.
Many of us have been, for a long
time, proponents of resolving the war
in Yemen, and it could be resolved if
the Iran regime will simply turn their
back and walk away. Unfortunately,
that is not likely. When I say many of
us have been longtime proponents, I
would certainly include the Presiding
Officer in that and commend him for
his long and hard work in that regard.
He has been dedicated to this for a long
time and has been a leader on this, for
which he is to be commended.
Like many of us here today, I am dis-
satisfied with the state of the U.S.-
Saudi relationship. Indeed, while Saudi
Arabia has long been a bulwark of our
Middle East policy, there is a growing
gap in U.S.-Saudi relations.
Frankly, aspects of Saudi Arabia’s
behavior are cause for serious concern.
We are taking a comprehensive look at
our relationship with Saudi Arabia on
the Foreign Relations Committee, and
it is common knowledge that there are
a number of pieces of legislation float-
ing around here—some of which have
been introduced and that are circu-
lating—that address this issue. We are
attempting to craft legislation that
can garner support in the committee,
address concerns on both sides of the
aisle, and actually become law.
I look forward to examining our in-
terests in a measured and responsible
way that will put the relationship on
the right trajectory. This is not an
easy needle to thread. All of us have
concerns, all of us have specific issues
in that regard, and what is important
is that we don’t just poke at this but
that we actually develop legislation
that is bipartisan and that can be
signed by the President and will be-
come law.
The debate today, however, is predi-
cated on the notion that this resolu-
tion will punish the Saudis and stop
the devastating humanitarian crisis in
Yemen. It will do neither of those. In
fact, the DOD has assessed that this
legislation would have no impact on
the limited support we are currently
providing today.
That said, there can be no arguing
that after years of conflict, Yemen is
now in the grip of the world’s worst hu-
manitarian crisis, and that is in spite
of the fact that many Members of this
body—including the Presiding Officer—
have gone way past limits to attempt
to try to do things that would help
that humanitarian crisis.
Just the simple delivery of humani-
tarian matters such as food in the
country have been frustrated by things
that logistically should be very easy
but haven’t been. I know the Presiding
Officer has been very active in that re-
gard and has been successful in that re-
gard, for which he should be com-
mended. An estimated 24 million—80
percent—of the Yemeni population are
in need of assistance, and 15.9 million
people—more than half of the country’s
population—remains severely food in-
secure.
A solution to this conflict must be
found. Make no mistake, many, indeed,
most of us, are committed to doing ev-
erything in our power to restore peace
in a country that has been ravished by
years of proxy war and fractious in-
fighting.
I believe it is axiomatic that lasting
peace can only be achieved through a
political settlement brokered by the
U.N. The U.N.-led peace talks are our
best bet for achieving peace in Yemen,
and they appear to be at a critical
juncture right now as we sit here
today.
As this body considers ways to drive
effective U.S. policy that helps end the
war and relieves humanitarian suf-
fering in Yemen, I would urge all par-
ties to abide by the agreement reached
last December in Stockholm and find a
political solution to the conflict. We
should remain committed to doing ev-
erything in our power to advance this
cause.
Thank you.

TRIBUTE TO WOODY WOODSIDE
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, one of
the great honors we have in the Senate
is the tradition of bringing Americans
of great reputation and achievement
before the RECORD of the U.S. Senate.
Today, I am proud to rise to speak
about a personal friend of mine—we
don’t often get to do this—a man by
the name of Woody Woodside. He is ac-
tually here with us today in the Senate
Galleries.
Woody is the epitome of what makes
America great. He is an institution in
south Georgia and in my hometown.
Woody has never met a stranger. He is
a man of character and a joy to be
around.
Woody graduated from The Citadel
and spent 23 years serving our country
in the Army and the Georgia Army Na-
tional Guard. He later worked 13 years
as a congressional staffer for Congress-
man Bo Ginn and Congressman Lind-
say Thomas, both of whom represented
Georgia’s First Congressional District.
Woody then became president of the
Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of
Commerce in Glynn County, where my
wife, Bonnie, and I today reside. Dur-
ing his 34 years at the chamber, Woody
has overseen a number of major eco-
nomic development projects and been a
true leader not only in that commu-
nity but across our entire State. Much
of Brunswick’s success and, indeed, the
success of our entire State of Georgia
can be attributed to Woody Woodside.
Woody is honest, persistent, and reli-
able. He knows how to get things done.
He knows how to laugh.
Woody has long been an advocate for
Georgia’s ports, and he played a pivotal
role in securing funding to deepen the
Brunswick Harbor. That project was
completed in 2007 and enabled the port
to specialize in roll-on, roll-off cargo,
like cars, trucks, and heavy construc-
tion equipment. Because of that, today,
the Brunswick Port is the No. 1 port in
the United States for new auto imports
and the No. 2 port for roll-on, roll-off
cargo in total. It is an amazing devel-
opment in less than a decade. This port
is a major economic driver in coastal
Georgia and supports 11,000 jobs in the
Brunswick area.
Woody has also worked to develop a
strong and diverse base of employers in
the area. Today, Glynn County is home
to the Federal Law Enforcement Train-
ing Center, FLETC, which is the larg-
est homeland security training center
in the United States. It is also home to
companies like Gulfstream Aerospace
Corporation, a major medical center,
the College of Coastal Georgia, and a
strong tourism industry.
One of Woody’s top priorities is
workforce development, and it has been
throughout his entire career. In 2009,
through partnerships with business and
education leaders, Woody helped to
open the Golden Isles College and Ca-
reer Academy. It was one of the first
programs of its kind in the entire State
of Georgia. Last year, Golden Isles Col-
lege and Career Academy was named
the best career academy in Georgia.
That is quite an achievement.
Clearly, our citizens, our community,
and our entire state are better off be-
cause of Woody Woodside’s leadership,
his dedication, and his perseverance.
Woody, Bonnie, and I can’t thank you
enough for all you have done for us per-
sonally and for the State of Georgia.
We are proud to know you and to call
you our friend. We wish you and Ellen
all the best in your retirement.
I know this won’t be the last time we
hear of Woody Woodside.
Thank you, Mr. President.

BARR HEARING
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, yester-
day, we had what I believe will be
viewed as a historic hearing in the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee. It is a com-
mittee I have been on for now about 41⁄2
years.
The Attorney General, Mr. Barr,
came before the committee to answer
questions about the special counsel in-
vestigation—an investigation that
took 675 days, cost more than $25 mil-
lion, had 34 people indicted, including
Russian nationals, more than 2,800 sub-
poenas, 500 witnesses, 500 search war-
rants, more than 230 orders for commu-
nication records, and 13 evidence re-
quests to foreign countries. I think by
those measures, that is considered a
pretty extensive investigation.
Back about 2 years ago, in August of
2017, Senator GRAHAM and I and a cou-
ple of other Members actually filed a
bill to make it difficult to have a spe-
cial counsel removed before an inves-
tigation had been completed. I actually
took a fair amount of heat from people
on my side of the aisle for doing that,
but I believed we needed to have this
investigation run its course, and it did.
It culminated in a more than 400-page
report that now is largely available to
the public. In fact, of the 400—I think
it is almost 440 pages—90 percent of
volume I, which is the volume that
talks about Russia tampering with
U.S. elections, 90 percent of that is
available to the American public. Vol-
ume II—the volume focused on whether
there was obstruction of justice—98
percent of that was made available to
the American people 3 weeks after the
Department of Justice received the
unredacted report.
Now, for the leaders of the Senate,
99.9 percent of the special counsel’s re-
port is available. You could say: Why
not 100 percent? Because we have rules
here—and I think it is also important
to point out that the Attorney General

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2595

had no legal obligation to release any
of this. This could have been deemed a
confidential matter, and it could never
have been available to the general pub-
lic. The Attorney General took the ex-
traordinary step of making sure that
as much as possible could be made
available, and he did a great job.
I might add that throughout the en-
tire process, the White House had the
opportunity to assert Executive privi-
lege. They could actually have portions
of the report blocked out or have it re-
dacted, which falls short of that. The
White House never reached out and re-
quested any omissions or, actually,
redactions of the report, which means
you can’t read it publicly—not one in
the nearly 31⁄2 weeks it took for the At-
torney General to get the report ready
for public consumption.
Some people are wondering, why did
it take so long? Because the process of
redaction has to take into account ba-
sically three different considerations.
You have to determine whether there
is a matter there that could be embar-
rassing to a party who had no involve-
ment; they were just a witness in the
investigation. It could be because there
are ongoing investigations, or it could
be because it is a threat to homeland
security. But even with that, 90 per-
cent of it is available to the general
public, on Russian tampering—98 per-
cent.
The reason I tell you that is at the
hearing yesterday, if you sit on the Ju-
diciary Committee—I am not a lawyer.
I am a businessperson who has been on
the Judiciary Committee for 41⁄2 years.
So I don’t necessarily go at this debate
the same way that maybe an attorney
would. We had a lot of the people in the
committee really trying to mislead the
American people. They were saying
that there was wrongdoing because the
Department of Justice had to take
about 31⁄2 weeks to get the report ready
for prime time. We are saying that the
report is available. It took about 3 or 4
weeks to actually make it available.
But they are almost suggesting that
was a criminal or obstructionist act.
Some, instead of going down that
tack, said that a letter—I have to ex-
plain the timeline.
On March 24, the Attorney General
issued a letter saying that the bottom
line of the report they were reviewing
was that there was no crime com-
mitted by the President and that there
was insufficient evidence to even sug-
gest there was obstruction.
Now, you have to understand these
two working in play. The crime that
many of my colleagues and friends on
the other side of the aisle said the
President committed never happened.
After 675 days and all the interviews
and all the warrants and everything
that I have said, there was no under-
lying crime.
The second half of the report is about
obstruction. This would be obstruction
in an investigation that concluded
there was no underlying crime. The
President was deemed not to have com-
mitted a crime. The President was
deemed not to have committed ob-
struction of justice.
So now we turn to a request to have
Robert Mueller come before the Judici-
ary Committee so they can ask him
questions. What questions could he
possibly answer that are not embodied
in a report that took 675 days, $25 mil-
lion, hundreds of witnesses, and dozens
of full-time professionals? What more
could Robert Mueller possibly say in a
3- or 4-hour hearing that is not em-
bodied in this report and within the
full view of the American public? I
don’t think it is about that.
Actually, one of the arguments that
were used in the committee was, we
need his advice on how to prevent Rus-
sia from tampering in our elections.
Really? I don’t need an attorney’s ad-
vice on how to prevent Russia from
tampering in our elections. Prosecu-
tors determine whether laws are bro-
ken. Robert Mueller is not a profes-
sional in cyber security and elections
safety; he is actually a prosecutor who
finished his job.
Some of the other ones said: Well,
the reason we want to get his input is
because the President is not interested
in securing elections. Well, I would ask
them to go back to the classified brief-
ings that I have sat in and they have
sat in where the administration is
clearly taking aggressive actions to
make sure that Russia can’t penetrate
our State election systems and that
they can’t meddle in the way they at-
tempted to in 2016.
So what this really boils down to is
theater—some of it almost to the level
of comedy. Let me give an example.
There was a House hearing today,
and I am about to put up a picture that
actually was on C–SPAN that actually
occurred in a House hearing. You tell
me whether the chair of that com-
mittee is actually serious about this
subject when you have a guy eating
fried chicken in place of where they
wanted Attorney General Barr to be.
This guy didn’t even have good enough
sense to have Bojangles’ chicken. And
they have the chair and others letting
him have that kind of theater in a
House committee room.
Really? I mean, can you honestly say
you are serious about this, or is this
like a circus and a political tool be-
cause you lost? You wanted the Presi-
dent to be guilty. You wanted to prove
he obstructed. I get that. A lot of it
was a political exercise. But the bot-
tom line is, after 675 days, almost $30
million when it is all totaled up, 34
people indicted, including Russians,
2,800 subpoenas, 500 witnesses inter-
viewed, 500 search warrants executed,
230 orders for communication records,
and 13 requests to foreign countries to
provide information—really? These
folks—some of them are prosecutors—
know better.
I will tell you that I think the Amer-
ican people want my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle to focus on what
Americans are really worried about.
They are worried about their economic
security. They are worried about their
healthcare security. They are worried
about keeping a job. They are worried
about sending their kids to college and
putting them through school. If you
want to win an election next year, stop
playing games and stop the theater.
The President is not guilty of a
crime. The President is not guilty of
obstruction of justice. It went through
one of the most rigorous investigations
in modern history.
To my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle, prove what policies and prior-
ities you have for the American people,
and win on the basis of your ideas on
your commitments. Stop the theater,
and get back to work.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO DANIELLE RIHA
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is
Thursday afternoon, and it is one of
the times that I enjoy the most in the
Senate because it is the time I get to
come down on the Senate floor and
talk about my State, talk about the
people in my State, and talk about the
people who make Alaska a great and
unique State in our wonderful country.
It is the time when we talk about the
person I refer to as the Alaskan of the
Week. It is someone who has helped to
make their community or Alaska or
America—or sometimes all of the
above—a better place. I think it is the
pages’ favorite time, too, because they
get to learn about Alaska and hear all
of the unique aspects that make Alas-
ka such a great, wonderful, and unique
State.
To those listening in the Gallery or
on TV, I always make a plug. It is also
a time to pitch Alaska for our visitors.
Come on up. You will have the trip of
a lifetime guaranteed. Don’t put it off.
It is time to book your trip to the
great State of Alaska.
Today I am going to recognize an ex-
traordinary teacher, Danielle Riha,
whom I just had the privilege of meet-
ing right here off the Senate floor, and
who is in the Gallery right now. We are
excited that she is hear watching. She
teaches at the Alaska Native Cultural
Charter School in Anchorage. That is a
pre-K through eighth grade charter
school. She is our Alaskan of the Week.
You might say: What is she doing?
Why is she in town?
She is in town because she was cho-
sen to be the 2019 Alaska Teacher of
the Year. She is so impressive in her
profession and her teaching is so
impactful on her students that she was
one of four finalists in America—across
the country—to be chosen for the Na-
tional Teacher of the Year award for
the whole country.
What does that mean?
In other words, she is viewed by her
peers, by her students, and by others as
one of the top four teachers in the
United States of America—our Alaskan
teacher of the year. We are so proud of
her.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2596 May 2, 2019
We have thousands of teachers in my
State, just as you do in yours, who do
such great work, day in and day out, to
make sure that our next generation is
not only educated on the facts and
things like math and history but that
they also understand, in the words of
the great leader Nelson Mandela, that
‘‘education is the most powerful weap-
on which you can use to change the
world.’’ That is true, and that is why
our teachers in Alaska and in America
are so important.
Danielle Riha is teaching our youth
so that they can go out and change the
world. She and all the teachers in Alas-
ka and in America have one of the
most important jobs for our Nation and
one of the most difficult jobs for our
Nation. We certainly salute and honor
them all, particularly this week, as so
many of the top teachers in the coun-
try have been in town.
Why is Danielle good at what she
does? Why did she get this award? Why
is she viewed as one of the top four
teachers in America? Why has she
touched so many students in Alaska?
How did she make her way into this
profession?
Let’s talk about that. Let me start
with the last question first.
She came to Alaska in 1995 when she
was a college student at North Texas
University. She came to a part of Alas-
ka called Unalaska—which is way out
in the Aleutian Island chain—to fish
and to help pay to finish college, where
she had plans to become a physical
therapist. That is a great profession as
well. Like a lot of people, she came up
to Alaska maybe for a little adventure,
and maybe she was only planning on
staying 6 months. Then, one day, the
principal of the school in Unalaska ap-
proached her when she was playing bas-
ketball and said: Have you ever
thought about being a teacher? How
about a substitute teacher?
Well, that was the beginning of the
love affair she had with teaching, with
the classroom, and with her ability to
really connect with kids, particularly
kids with difficult emotional chal-
lenges.
She finished her education degree at
the University of Alaska in Anchorage.
Then, she taught for 7 years in two
small villages in Southwest Alaska.
While there, she helped to develop the
curriculum that was culturally appro-
priate for her students, most of whom
were Alaska Natives. She was then re-
cruited to teach at the school where
she now teaches, the Alaska Native
Cultural Charter School, and she was
one of the original teachers to start up
this great new teaching and education
venture in 2008.
Let me read from her Teacher of the
Year application form:
Imagine you are a 7th grade student living
in a rural, Yup’ik speaking, Alaskan commu-
nity.
By the way, we have many commu-
nities in our State where English is not
the first language and where the Alas-
ka Native languages are the first lan-
guages.
Back to the application:
The only way to get to your village is by
small plane or boat in the summer and
snowmachine in the winter. You have never
been to a city or had life experiences that in-
clude seeing an elevator, stores, restaurants,
or roads [even outside your community].
Your family survives by subsistence hunt-
ing and gathering from the land of their an-
cestors.
By the way, that is how thousands of
Alaskans survive to this day.
Now imagine yourself in math class consid-
ering a word problem that takes place in
California and involves distance,
rollerblades, a convenience store, and a curb.
That is in the application. What this
is getting at is that there are things so
many Americans think are common for
education that in certain communities
in Alaska, and I am sure in other
places, aren’t common. It is difficult to
teach when everything is assumed to
be the same when it is not. You can
imagine how confusing that might be.
These are the kinds of educational
challenges that Alaskan students, par-
ticularly in our most rural commu-
nities, face every single day.
What did Miss Riha do to help with
the confusion? Working with Alaskan
Native elders, she helped to create
what she calls the Kayak Module,
which uses culturally relevant mate-
rial to teach math, science, social stud-
ies, and language arts.
Let me give you an example of how
she uses the module to teach math and
science. The students are given blocks
of clay and put into groups. Each group
then designs a kayak of different
shapes and different weights. They are
tested for speed, water disbursements,
and capacity. Data is collected.
Hypotheses and mathematical calcula-
tions are made, and the students learn
from using these examples that are ac-
tually examples from their own lives,
and they love doing so.
This can work across cultures. Think
about it. Alaska Native students who
are on rivers or who are on the ocean,
or Samoan students, many of whom
live like in the example—all of these
kinds of students have boats in their
culture. They understand that.
‘‘As an educator,’’ Danielle said,
‘‘nothing feels better than allowing
students the opportunities to bridge
what they already know culturally to
new content, and to teach them to
have a voice for themselves.’’ This
helps them learn. Isn’t that a simple,
but insightful approach to teaching?
I think you are all getting the pic-
ture of why she was considered one of
the top four teachers in America. She
and the whole school are also devoted
to ensuring that the students go to
school in a very safe place and where
the students feel welcome. For exam-
ple, one student who wrote a letter in
support of her for her Teacher of the
Year nomination talked about how she
was worried about being bullied be-
cause she came from a different cul-
ture. She was Muslim. Because of that,
she started to feel that she was falling
behind in reading and math. This stu-
dent wrote:
[Miss Riha] helped me be bold enough to
teach others about my culture in a way that
made me feel proud of who I am. Needless to
say, I caught up in my math and reading
within one year because of her leadership,
and now I love learning.
That is from one of her students.
That student is now studying to be-
come a dental hygienist at the Univer-
sity of Anchorage. She and Miss Riha
still stay in touch. As you know, we all
have that teacher—maybe one, maybe
two, maybe several, but that one
teacher—who made a difference in our
lives, who encouraged us, who believed
in us when maybe no one else did and
who helped us through hard times by
passing on the joy of learning, by pass-
ing on the passion of learning.
Danielle and thousands of other
teachers across my State, and millions
across our great Nation, wake up every
day to do that as their mission, to take
on one of the most important things
any of us can do, and that is educating
our youth.
Danielle, congratulations for being
Alaska’s Teacher of the Year, for being
one of the top four teachers in the
United States of America, and, impor-
tantly, thank you and congratulations
on being our Alaskan of the Week.
I yield the floor.

NOMINATIONS
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will be
brief. I see my colleague from Ten-
nessee is here.
Earlier this afternoon, the Presi-
dent’s designee, Stephen Moore—not
quite yet his nominee, but the Presi-
dent put his name out there to be a
Governor of the Federal Reserve—with-
drew his name from consideration, in
large part because so many Repub-
licans in this body were unhappy with
his selection.
This is the second Trump failure for
the Federal Reserve just in the last
month. He was about to nominate Her-
man Cain. There was a lot of outcry
about his lack of qualifications. I am
not sure why the President came up
with him. Then he withdrew, and Ste-
phen Moore’s name had been put out
there, too, and there were the same
kinds of complaints about Moore—not
just about what he wrote and said over
the years, but really about his reputa-
tion as a thinker, as an economist, and
as a strategist on economic issues.
The President has tried twice. I don’t
know when we have ever seen this be-
fore, where the President hasn’t been
able to find somebody who understands
the independence of the Fed and is
qualified to take on that awesome re-
sponsibility to be on the Federal Re-
serve. It is as influential as any eco-
nomic position in this government, I
think.
Now the President has two new
chances again. I am hopeful that he
will think about not appointing some-
body whose whole mantra is trickle-
down economics—to give tax cuts to
the richest people in the country and

hope it trickles down and we get a bet-
ter economy. That never works.
I am hopeful that the President bet-
ter understands that you focus on the
middle—my earned income tax credit
bill, for instance—and you focus on tax
breaks for the people making $20,000,
$30,000, $50,000, and up to $100,000 a
year. They will spend those dollars
they get in tax breaks and build the
economy, whether in Terre Haute, in
Nashville, or in Cleveland. We know
how important that is.
I hope the President will look at the
next Governor of the Federal Reserve—
these two appointments—and think
about the dignity of work and think
about someone who respects and hon-
ors work.
You may remember that Stephen
Moore made some really caustic and
nasty comments about two great cities
in my State—Cleveland and Cincinnati.
As much as that was offensive, what is
really offensive is how he just doesn’t
seem to respect the dignity of work
and respect these workers. Whether
they are physical therapists at hos-
pitals, whether they clean bathrooms
at hotels, whether they are construc-
tion workers, whether they are mid-
level managers, or whether they are
salespeople on the road, it is important
that we honor and respect work and
understand the dignity of work. I am
hopeful the President will see that the
next two nominees for the Federal Re-
serve will think about the American
workforce.
One of my most fun moments and
most productive moments and days in
my time in the Senate was when I
asked Janet Yellen, the Chair of the
Federal Reserve, to come out and visit
a major aluminum stamping plant for
helicopter blades in Cleveland, which is
not far from where I live. It gave her a
perspective of seeing what Americans
do for a living sometimes in manufac-
turing, sometimes in sales, sometimes
in service—whatever it is.
I am hopeful that this is who the
President will look at—somebody who
will respect the dignity of work, some-
one who will want to go out, as Abra-
ham Lincoln said, and get ‘‘my public
opinion baths’’ and get outside the hal-
lowed halls of the Federal Reserve, see
America, and translate that into a pol-
icy that really does help working fami-
lies.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
just have to say a couple of words
about the economy. Since my col-
league from Ohio was speaking of the
economy, I will say this: Showing re-
spect for workers and for work means
that you show respect by realizing that
the best way to stimulate the economy
is with a job. That is something we
have seen this administration and, I
will say, a Republican-led Senate, and,
previously, a Republican-led House
do—generate tax reform, which is giv-
ing us economic growth that we have
not seen in years. Economic growth of
3.2 percent is what our GDP numbers
were last Friday—3.2 percent. We
haven’t had that in a decade.
How do you respect people? You cre-
ate opportunity. How do you show re-
spect for workers? You open doors.
That is what you realize. It is not the
government that creates jobs. It is the
men and women who build businesses,
who grow businesses—the men and
women who say: I have an American
dream, and I want the opportunity to
make that dream come true.
That is an element of respect, and
this President and Republican leader-
ship have delivered on that with every
single opportunity we have had.
I disagree with the philosophical ap-
proach that my colleague from Ohio
has expressed, and I would encourage
all Senators to look at what is hap-
pening in their communities and look
at the jobs growth. Tennesseans are so
excited that there is a growing econ-
omy and that they have more money in
their paychecks at the end of the
month.
TRIBUTE TO MELISSA MILLER
Mr. President, Senator SULLIVAN was
mentioning his Teacher of the Year
from Alaska. As I begin my remarks
about some wonderful things that have
happened with women and for women
and by women in this country, I want
to mention that I just left a visit with
our Tennessee Teacher of the Year—
Melissa Miller from Columbia—who
teaches in nearby Franklin at the ele-
mentary school. We are thrilled for her
and are honored to have her here in
DC. I join in praising her for the great
work that she does for children by en-
couraging them to learn how they best
learn so that they can live their
versions of the American dream.
SUFFRAGE COIN
Mr. President, I rise in support of S.
1235, the Women’s Suffrage Centennial
Commemorative Coin Act. It was intro-
duced by Senator GILLIBRAND and me.
It was 150 years ago this month that
the National Woman Suffrage Associa-
tion was founded by Susan B. Anthony
and a group of very brave suffrage ac-
tivists who fought for all American
women to have the right to vote. This
bipartisan measure honors the centen-
nial and the legacy of the suffrage ac-
tivists with a commemorative coin to
be minted by the U.S. Treasury.
As we approach the 100th anniversary
of the ratification of the 19th Amend-
ment next year—also called the ‘‘Susan
B. Anthony Amendment’’—Americans
are rediscovering the history of wom-
en’s suffrage and the movement and
the stories of the women who led it to
victory. These stories are a vast part of
our Nation’s history, but they are not
often discussed, which is something
that we are seeking to change. It would
be a tragedy if the stories of these
trailblazers were forgotten by future
generations. It is our hope that by
passing this important measure—and it
is bipartisan—we will help to keep
their memories alive.
We often take women’s right to vote
for granted, as if it were something
that was an inevitable outcome in our
history. In truth, winning the vote for
women was anything but inevitable. It
required 72 years—think about that, 72
years—of ceaseless agitation by gen-
erations of dedicated, fearless suffra-
gists who fought against centuries of
law and millennia of tradition.
I quote Susan B. Anthony: ‘‘I declare
to you that woman must not depend
upon the protection of man, but must
be taught to protect herself, and there
I take my stand.’’
The women’s suffrage movement
began in July of 1848 with the first
women’s rights convention that was
held in Seneca Falls, NY, which is Sen-
ator GILLIBRAND’s home State. That
fight concluded in August of 1920 in
Nashville, TN, which is my home
State.
Tennessee was the 36th and final
State needed to ratify the 19th Amend-
ment. So we did. In true Tennessee
style on that hot August day in down-
town Nashville, a 24-year-old freshman
State representative named Harry
Burn, from McMinn County, TN,
changed his vote from no to yes, ensur-
ing the amendment’s adoption. Why
did he change that vote, you may ask.
Because his mother—Miss Febb, as she
was known—wrote him a letter that re-
minded him to be a good boy and to
vote for the amendment.
As we get ready to celebrate Moth-
er’s Day this month, the story of Harry
Burn and Miss Febb is a great reminder
of how important it is for each and
every one of us to heed our mothers’
advice. Mothers are always right.
Consider how remarkable it is that
the 19th Amendment was not ratified
until 132 years after the ratification of
the U.S. Constitution in 1788—132
years. The 19th Amendment marked
the single largest extension of voting
rights in American history. Many of
the women who led the movement did
not live to see their mission accom-
plished, and many of the women who
cast their first votes were not born
when that movement began. As the
first female Senator from Tennessee, I
feel it is my duty to honor the life and
the legacy of those brave suffragists.
I am so pleased to have worked with
Senator GILLIBRAND on this truly bi-
partisan celebration of a milestone in
our Nation’s history. It is cause for fur-
ther celebration that we are able to in-
troduce this legislation in a Chamber
where, for the first time in U.S. his-
tory, one-fourth of its Members are fe-
male. I am also delighted to report
that our legislation has the support of
all 25 female Senators.
As we approach the centennial, it is
our hope that this commemoration will
increase public awareness and appre-
ciation for the history of the women’s
suffrage movement. Honoring women
who exemplify patriotism is an excel-
lent example of what Washington can
achieve when both sides come together
and remember the maxim that there is
more that unites us than divides us.

S2598 May 2, 2019
S. 206
Mr. President, I also recently joined
Senator TESTER in introducing the
‘‘Hello Girls’’ Congressional Gold
Medal Act to honor the women soldiers
of the Army Signal Corps during World
War I.
Another example of trailblazers in
history, these women enabled Amer-
ican and French Armed Forces to com-
municate clearly with one another in
order to enter battle with their being
armed with the intelligence they need-
ed to win those fights. They changed
the course of the war at the height of
the conflict and left Europe in a safer
state thanks to their efforts.
America’s values are reflected in the
history that we choose to honor. ‘‘We
must remember the past, hold fast to
the present and build for the future,’’
the great Tennessee suffragist, Susan
Shelton White, once wrote. ‘‘If you
stand in your accepted place today, it
is because some woman had to fight
yesterday. We should be ashamed to
stand on ground won by women in the
past without making an effort to honor
them by winning a higher and wider
field for the future. It is a debt we
owe.’’
The medal of which I have spoken
and this coin are small ways in which
to honor these women for the debt that
we owe them. It is a debt that can only
be repaid by encouraging all women to
exercise these hard-fought rights and
accept more leadership roles when they
are presented—whether they are at
home, at church, in the workplace, in
civic life, or, maybe, in public service.
I take inspiration from the women
who blazed trails before me, and I hope
the women of this Chamber will pro-
vide that same type of inspiration to
generations of women who will come
behind us.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
BRAUN). The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the
quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
2019 MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY TRUSTEES’
REPORTS
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, last month
I came to the floor to talk about the
need to confront our country’s surging
deficits and debt.
At the time, we had just considered a
supplemental disaster appropriations
bill that would spend billions of dollars
beyond the statutory budget caps with-
out any pretense of offsetting that
spending, and I called for Congress to
better budget for disasters.
Now, prompted by reports issued last
week by Social Security and Medicare
trustees that show these programs re-
main on an unsustainable path, I again
come to the floor to sound the alarm
over our country’s long-term fiscal
health. With trillion-dollar annual
deficits expected to return soon and
our national debt now topping $22 tril-
lion, we cannot afford to keep ignoring
the warning signs that we are on a dan-
gerous fiscal course.
The trustees estimate that Social Se-
curity’s combined trust funds will be
insolvent by 2035. Sounds like way
down the road? I don’t think so. Medi-
care’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund
will become insolvent even sooner, by
2026.
Over the next 75 years, Medicare’s
and Social Security’s combined sched-
uled expenditures are projected to ex-
ceed their dedicated revenues by more
than $59 trillion, or 35 percent, on a
present-value basis. Within 10 years,
Social Security and Medicare alone
will account for more than half of all
Federal noninterest spending.
We are facing a strong demographic
headwind. Let me say that again. We
are facing a strong demographic
headwind. An aging population and ris-
ing healthcare costs continue to in-
crease the gulf between mandatory pro-
gram spending and dedicated revenues.
For decades, experts have warned of
the budget pressures we would face as
members of the baby boom generation
aged and became eligible for Medicare
and Social Security. Congress hasn’t
paid much attention to that crisis.
Every day, roughly 10,000 Americans
turn 65, and they are living longer than
they were when these programs were
conceived. I guess that is a good thing,
but it places additional strain on the
program finances and the Federal
budget.
Without changes to current law, all
Social Security and Medicare bene-
ficiaries will see automatic across-the-
board reductions in benefits when the
respective funds run out of money. Of
course, the political pressure would be
enormous to avoid the automatic cuts,
but with our country already facing $22
trillion in debt, further raiding of the
U.S. Treasury’s general fund is not an
option. It could cause a borrowing cri-
sis.
First, let me focus on Social Secu-
rity. At the end of last year, Social Se-
curity provided payments to 63 million
beneficiaries, including 47 million re-
tired workers and their dependents, 6
million survivors of deceased workers,
and 10 million disabled workers and
their dependents.
As I mentioned, Social Security’s
combined trust funds are slated to be-
come depleted in 2035. That means that
in 16 years’ time, when today’s 46-year-
olds first become eligible for retire-
ment benefits, the program will only be
able to pay about 80 percent of the
scheduled benefits, according to the
trustees.
Think about that. Absent action
from Congress, we are just 16 years
away from not being able to pay full
benefits, and that is full benefits to
those who are retired right now, as
well as those who are upcoming. It is
no longer a far-off concern.
Let me turn now to the Medicare
Program, which is an even more press-
ing problem.
The trustees estimate that in 2026,
Medicare’s Hospital Insurance Trust
Fund—which covers inpatient hospital
services, hospice care, skilled nursing
facilities, and home health services—
will be depleted.
Once the fund becomes insolvent, ab-
sent a change in the law, Medicare can
only pay hospital benefits up to an
amount of revenue that comes into the
trust fund in that given year. It is the
same thing for Social Security. Antici-
pating that money will be worth as
much and that inflation will not have
driven it up even more, the trustees es-
timate that in 2026, revenues will cover
only 89 percent of program costs and by
2046, that figure will decline to 77 per-
cent—pretty hefty cuts.
Medicare’s other trust fund, which
primarily pays for physician services
and prescription drugs, operates dif-
ferently. While it isn’t in danger of in-
solvency because it gets money from
the Treasury’s general fund and the
premiums it collects from beneficiaries
are adjusted annually, its growing
costs will put greater pressure on pre-
mium-paying beneficiaries and on Fed-
eral taxpayers. That is where the ex-
cess comes from.
Last year, general revenue transfers
into the trust fund equaled 16.2 percent
of all personal and corporate Federal
income taxes collected by the Federal
Government. By the end of the 75-year
window, the trustees expect this figure
to increase to more than 28 percent.
That would be more than 28 percent of
all personal and corporate Federal in-
come taxes collected by the Federal
Government.
For years, the trustees of Social Se-
curity and Medicare have warned that
these programs are unsustainable. Let
me repeat that again. For years, the
trustees of Social Security and Medi-
care have warned that these programs
are on an unsustainable path, but suc-
cessive Congresses and administrations
have continued a bipartisan tradition
of ignoring this uncomfortable fact.
Of course, ignoring the problem will
not make it go away. In this case, the
opposite is true. The longer we wait to
make financial repairs to Social Secu-
rity and Medicare, the more severe the
changes needed to ensure their insol-
vency will have to be.
We must work together, on a bipar-
tisan basis, to find long-term solutions
that secure the future of these pro-
grams. The earlier we do it, the less
painful it is. When considering a $59
trillion problem like this, there are no
quick fixes or easy choices, but the
sooner we act, the easier it will be to
preserve Social Security and Medicare
for the millions of Americans who de-
pend on them and who will be depend-
ing on them, while safeguarding the
programs for even more future genera-
tions.
To be clear, I want to make sure So-
cial Security and Medicare are able to

continue providing benefits to current
beneficiaries, as well as those who may
need these programs in the future. If
we don’t make changes to the way
these programs currently operate, in
the future, a lot of people will just be
out of luck. In order to prevent that
from happening, we have to work to-
gether, and we have to consider a wide
variety of options to ensure their sol-
vency in the long term.
While we may disagree on what the
ideal solution might look like, I hope
we can all agree on the need to put our
mandatory spending programs and the
broader Federal budget on a long-term,
sustainable fiscal course. That means
having the revenues match up with the
costs. They don’t now. There are defi-
cits already, and the funds are being
depleted.
I ask for everyone’s help to solve
this. It can only be done if both sides of
the aisle agree to do something.
I thank you for your attention.
I yield the floor.

ator from West Virginia.
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, as we
begin the month of May, which we are
just 2 days in now, and our Nation’s ob-
servance of Older Americans’ Month, I
come to the floor to speak on a topic
that is very close to my heart, and that
is Alzheimer’s disease.
Like so many Americans, I have felt
the impact of this disease. I lost both
of my parents to Alzheimer’s disease
pretty close to the same time. Our fam-
ily—my brother and my sister and I—
helped to care for them. I understand
the difficulties that caregivers and
families have as they are trying to fig-
ure out how to face this difficult chal-
lenge because this disease is dev-
astating, especially to the patients and
their loved ones.
My father passed away in January of
2015, just 1 day after I was sworn in as
a U.S. Senator. My mother, Shelley,
passed away just a few months before-
hand, in September of 2014.
There is not a book that has yet been
written that can tell you what to do
when a loved one is diagnosed because
each case is different, and there is no
magic formula, but I feel strongly that
we can do much more to help our care-
givers, to ease the pain of those who
suffer from this disease, and, most im-
portantly, to find a cure.
The statistics surrounding Alz-
heimer’s are staggering. Over 5 million
Americans are living with the disease,
and it is estimated that as many as 16
million will have the disease by 2050 if
medical breakthroughs do not slow or,
better yet, cure this disease.
In my home State of West Virginia,
over 38,000 West Virginians are cur-
rently living with the disease, and
these are just the ones we know about.
A lot of these cases go undiagnosed or
are unreported.
Across the country, nearly one in
every three seniors who dies each year
has Alzheimer’s or another type of de-
mentia. The cost of caring—and this is
not the emotional cost; this is the ac-
tual dollar cost—for those with Alz-
heimer’s and other dementias is also
notable—an estimated $277 billion in
2018, increasing to $1.1 trillion by the
year 2050.
These numbers make it clear that we
have much work we need to do for
those living with the disease, for those
caring for them, and for the many who
face a future diagnosis.
Over the past few months, I have
taken some first steps to address needs
facing each of these groups. Fortu-
nately, this is not a task I am working
on alone—as I said, almost everybody
is touched by this disease—and I have
great bipartisan partners to work with.
Last month, I joined Senators STABE-
NOW, WICKER, and MENENDEZ to intro-
duce the CHANGE Act. This bipartisan
legislation encourages early assess-
ment and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. It
seeks to better utilize the ‘‘Welcome to
Medicare’’ initial exam and annual
Medicare wellness visits to screen, de-
tect, and diagnose Alzheimer’s and re-
lated dementias in their earliest
stages. It also establishes payment
measures to incentivize detection, di-
agnosis, and discussion of appropriate
care planning services, including the
potential for clinical trial participa-
tion. Let’s be honest. A conversation
along these lines on this topic is very
difficult.
Early assessment and diagnosis offer
the important possibility for the pa-
tient to be able to be involved in deci-
sions regarding their own care—involve
the people before they can no longer
make that decision for themselves. I
wish I had been able to do that. I tried,
but I wasn’t able to kind of get that an-
swer that I was hoping for.
That is a goal that Senators STABE-
NOW, COLLINS, MARKEY, MENENDEZ, and
I had when we championed the HOPE
for Alzheimer’s Act back in the 114th
Congress. It is a goal we achieved in
2016, when the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services announced that
Medicare would begin to pay for an in-
dividual care plan for newly diagnosed
Alzheimer’s patients, effectively imple-
menting our legislation.
This new benefit went into effect in
the year 2017. It encourages doctors to
give a clear diagnosis to patients with
Alzheimer’s disease. That includes in-
formation about treatment options and
what medical and community services
are available.
Here is the rub. Unfortunately, in
2017, less than 1 percent of seniors liv-
ing with Alzheimer’s actually received
the care planning benefit that was cre-
ated in the HOPE for Alzheimer’s Act.
So our bipartisan team regathered—as
I mentioned, these are not easy con-
versations. They are not easy for fami-
lies, and they are not easy for medical
professionals. In late March, we intro-
duced the Improving HOPE Act.
This bill would require the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services to
conduct outreach, to make sure our
healthcare providers are aware of this
important benefit, and to report back
on rates of utilization and barriers we
need to know about. Hopefully, this
will help ensure more Alzheimer’s pa-
tients and their families actually re-
ceive this benefit, as well as the infor-
mation it is intended to provide.
It is also important to remember
that while many living with Alz-
heimer’s are in their later years, like
my parents were, there are also more
than 200,000 Americans under the age of
65 who are living with Alzheimer’s. I
have met several who are in their early
stages. It is a difficult disease at any
time, but for a younger person, it is
tremendously sad.
These individuals and their families
also need access to support services
that most their age don’t require and
don’t need. To make sure they have ac-
cess, I recently joined Senators COL-
LINS, CASEY, and JONES to introduce
the Younger-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease
Act. This bill will amend the Older
Americans Act to allow individuals
under the age of 60, who are diagnosed
with younger onset Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, to access its support programs.
Under current law, only those over the
age of 60 are eligible for Older Ameri-
cans Act programs, leaving Americans
with younger onset Alzheimer’s with-
out access to vital programs and serv-
ices. The Younger-Onset Alzheimer’s
Disease Act would address this dis-
parity, and it would ensure that these
individuals have access to things like
nutritional services, supportive serv-
ices, and respite care through the Na-
tional Family Caregiver Support Pro-
gram.
Of course, it is also essential that we
continue to work toward a cure for this
heartbreaking disease. As a member of
the Senate Appropriations Committee,
I have worked with Labor, Health and
Human Services Subcommittee Chair-
man BLUNT and others to provide re-
sources for crucial Alzheimer’s re-
search.
In fact, with the passage of the
Labor-H bill last year, we surpassed
the $2 billion milestone when it comes
to Alzheimer’s research. That means
we are making sure NIH has the fund-
ing it needs to continue its work and to
help to support the work of others.
I was recently very proud to welcome
to West Virginia Dr. Marie Bernard.
She is the Deputy Director of the Na-
tional Institute on Aging at NIH. She
came to West Virginia University,
where we visited the Rockefeller Neu-
roscience Institute, which will be open-
ing soon—actually, I think in about 10
days.
We spent the day learning more
about the innovative and
groundbreaking work being done there.
Dr. Bernard shared with the Institutes’
faculty students and staff the opportu-
nities this increased funding can offer
to this field of research at West Vir-
ginia University.
It is easy to get discouraged when
you hear about a once-promising clin-
ical trial not moving forward—which

was the news just 2 weeks ago. They
were moving forward with the clinical
trial medication, and they had to stop
the trial because they weren’t getting
satisfactory results—or when we learn
that another person we know was diag-
nosed with the disease or when a cure
really does seem so far away.
Hearing the passion in Dr. Bernard’s
voice for the work she has dedicated
her life to and seeing the excitement
and hope in the eyes of the students
who listened to her, the young re-
searchers, well, that was proof to me
that we are making progress and an il-
lustration of the will and determina-
tion that exists to continue making
process.
I share that will and determination,
and I will continue to work for the day
when a patient and their families can
more easily receive an early assess-
ment and diagnosis, for the day when,
following such a diagnosis, they rou-
tinely receive an individual care plan
to help guide them, for the day when
Alzheimer’s patients of all ages are
able to access the Older Americans Act
support services but best yet, of course,
the day when we can celebrate the first
person cured of Alzheimer’s disease.
I think this is a mission for me in
loving memory of both of my parents
who fought hard through the diagnosis,
but in the end, for those of you who
have been exposed to this through your
own families, it is a losing battle, a sad
battle, a tough battle, and an emotion-
ally and financially draining battle.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues to make all of this and so
much more a reality of those living
with Alzheimer’s and those who care
and love them.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

MUELLER REPORT
Mr. CARDIN. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. I rise today to discuss Special
Counsel Robert Mueller’s recent report,
which is titled ‘‘The Report on the In-
vestigation into Russia’s Interference
in the 2016 Presidential Election.’’
The Mueller investigation was au-
thorized to ensure a full and thorough
investigation of the Russian Govern-
ment’s efforts to interfere in the 2016
Presidential election, as well as any
links and/or coordination between the
Russian Government and individuals
associated with the campaign of Don-
ald Trump.
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosen-
stein said, when appointing the special
counsel:
[T]he public interest requires me to place
this investigation under the authority of a
person who exercises a degree of independ-
ence from the normal chain of command.
. . . I am confident that [Special Counsel
Mueller] will follow the facts, apply the law,
and reach a just result.
I encourage all Americans to read the
redacted version of the Mueller report
and draw their own conclusions. The
report lays out in stark detail Russia’s
attack on our country before and dur-
ing our 2016 elections.
The special counsel rightly concluded
that the Russian Government inter-
fered in the 2016 Presidential election
in a sweeping and systematic fashion.
In January 2018, I issued a report on
behalf of the Democrats on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee titled
‘‘Putin’s Asymmetric Assault on De-
mocracy in Russia, and Europe: Its Im-
plications on U.S. National Security.’’
That report outlines some of the same
tactics used by Russia and Europe that
the Mueller report identifies were used
in our 2016 elections. Mr. Putin has
waged war against democracy.
The Mueller report concluded that
Russia interfered in the 2016 Presi-
dential election principally through
two operations. First, a Russian entity
carried out a social media campaign
that favored Presidential candidate
Donald J. Trump and disparaged Presi-
dential candidate Hillary Clinton; sec-
ond, a Russian intelligence service con-
ducted computer intrusion operations
against entities, employees, and volun-
teers working on the Clinton campaign
and then released stolen documents.
The investigation also identified nu-
merous links between the Russian Gov-
ernment and the Trump campaign.
When discussing the Mueller report,
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosen-
stein recently said: ‘‘There was over-
whelming evidence that Russian
operatives hacked American computers
and defrauded American citizens, and
that is only the tip of the iceberg of a
comprehensive Russian strategy to in-
fluence elections, promote social dis-
cord, and undermine America, just like
they do in many other countries.’’
The Director of National Intelligence
testified before the Senate in January
that ‘‘even as Russia faces a weakening
economy, the Kremlin is stepping up
its campaign to divide Western polit-
ical and security institutions and un-
dermine the post-WWII international
order. We expect Russia will continue
to wage its information war against de-
mocracies and to use social media to
attempt to divide our societies.’’ We
expect that Russia will continue to
wage its information war against de-
mocracies and to use social media to
attempt to divide our societies.
The special counsel fulfilled his man-
date to fully investigate both criminal
acts surrounding the 2016 elections, as
well as efforts to obstruct this critical
investigation. Let me be clear that
President Trump has consistently
taken steps to deny Russia’s involve-
ment in tampering in our elections, re-
sisted efforts to hold Russia account-
able, besmirched the reputation of the
special counsel while trying to dismiss
him or willfully impeding his inves-
tigation, and repeatedly attacked the
integrity of our intelligence and law
enforcement Agencies. Despite the
President’s egregious behavior, the spe-
cial counsel’s work has resulted in doz-
ens of indictments and numerous con-
victions and guilty pleas.
Several legal cases and investiga-
tions are still ongoing. Let me remind
my colleagues that while the special
counsel has delivered its final report,
there are several ongoing Federal in-
vestigations and criminal trials, in-
cluding those publicly known in the
Southern District of New York and in
Washington, DC.
Congress must now fulfill its over-
sight obligations under the Constitu-
tion. In order to prevent future attacks
on our country and stem abuses of
power, we must review a complete copy
of the report as soon as possible and
hear direct testimony from Special
Counsel Mueller.
The Mueller report laid out numer-
ous disturbing episodes where behavior
by President Trump may have con-
stituted obstruction of justice. The re-
port stated:
‘‘If we had confidence after a thorough in-
vestigation of the facts that the President
clearly did not commit obstruction of jus-
tice, we would so state. Based on the facts
and the applicable legal standards, however,
we are unable to reach that judgment. The
evidence we obtained about the President’s
actions and intent presents difficult issues
that prevent us from conclusively deter-
mining that no criminal conduct occurred.’’
Indeed, the report stated that ‘‘the
President’s efforts to influence the in-
vestigation were mostly unsuccessful,
but that is largely because the persons
who surrounded the President declined
to carry out orders or accede to his re-
quests.’’
Congress should therefore closely ex-
amine the President’s behavior, keep-
ing in mind the President’s obligations
to fully execute the laws and preserve,
protect, and defend the Constitution.
Members of Congress took an oath as
well to support the Constitution before
taking office. The American public now
deserves to hear directly from Special
Counsel Robert Mueller through the
relevant House and Senate committees.
Congress still has the ability to make
a judgment on the obstruction of jus-
tice. Congress must now fulfill its over-
sight function under the Constitution
and do all we can to prevent future at-
tacks on our country and to stem
abuses of power and corruption.
Congress has an obligation to under-
stand the report fully and respond in
such a way to prevent such attacks
from happening in the future. This
should involve prompt and thorough
hearings in both the House and Senate.
Here are some areas where the Sen-
ate should consider legislative action.
First, if an American is approached
by a foreign entity about involvement
in an American election, that Amer-
ican should have certain responsibil-
ities to immediately notify appropriate
law enforcement agencies. I think
many of us thought that was probably
already the law.
Second, legislation should be consid-
ered to protect our elections from for-
eign interference by imposing appro-
priate responsibility on social media
platforms and amending our election

laws in regard to attribution on adver-
tisements, including through social
media.
Third, the Senate should consider ad-
ditional sanctions on Russia for its
documented attacks against our 2016
elections.
Congress must continue to take the
lead in defending U.S. national secu-
rity against continuing Russian ag-
gression against democratic institu-
tions at home and abroad.
Earlier this year, I joined other Sen-
ators in introducing the Defending
American Security from Kremlin Ag-
gression Act of 2019. This comprehen-
sive legislation seeks to increase eco-
nomic, political, and diplomatic pres-
sure on the Russian Federation in re-
sponse to Russia’s interference in
democratic processes abroad, malign
influence in Syria, and aggression
against Ukraine.
I am pleased to work with my col-
leagues on a comprehensive, bipartisan
effort to counter Russia’s pervasive at-
tacks on our electoral systems and
cyber infrastructure. I introduced the
Election Systems Integrity Act to bet-
ter America’s election systems so that
we are aware when a foreign national
or interest seeks to obtain ownership
or control of election service providers
or related infrastructure.
The American people have every rea-
son to be disappointed and alarmed at
the lack of preparedness to defend this
Nation. News reports just last week
suggested that former Homeland Secu-
rity Secretary Nielsen unsuccessfully
tried to elevate the U.S. Government
response to the cyber security threat
to the 2020 elections, apparently be-
cause President Trump was not inter-
ested in the issue and did not want to
call into further question the legit-
imacy of his 2016 election victory, with
Russian assistance.
Recently, Jared Kushner inconceiv-
ably tried to argue that Russia’s inter-
ference amounted to ‘‘a couple of
Facebook ads’’ and that congressional
and special counsel investigations were
‘‘more harmful’’ to the United States
than the actual Russian interference.
Congress needs to look very carefully
and independently at the 10 episodes
that could constitute obstruction of
justice by Trump, where Attorney Gen-
eral Barr ‘‘disagreed with some of the
Special Counsel’s legal theories, and
felt some of the episodes examined did
not amount to obstruction as a matter
of law.’’
Remember that President Trump
tried to label Special Counsel Muller’s
probe as a witch hunt, but Special
Counsel Mueller, a well-respected
former FBI Director under both Presi-
dents Bush and Obama, who was unani-
mously confirmed by the Senate for
the position on two separate occasions,
kept his head down and did his work
without fear or favor.
The special counsel’s investigation
has resulted in, so far, 199 criminal
counts, 37 people and entities that have
been indicted/charged as a result of the
investigation, 7 guilty pleas, 1 trial
conviction, and 5 people sentenced to
prison.
The report is clear that the Trump
campaign knew it would benefit from
Russia’s illegal activities. ‘‘Several in-
dividuals affiliated with the Trump
Campaign lied to the Office, and to
Congress, about their interactions with
Russian-affiliated individuals.’’
Mueller’s report states that some cor-
roborating electronic communications
were deleted.
One editorial in the Washington Post
asked the question: How could there be
obstruction of justice even if there was
little evidence to support the under-
lying suspicion of Trump campaign co-
ordination with Russia?
First, Mr. Mueller argued:
‘‘Obstruction of justice can be motivated
by a desire to protect non-criminal personal
interests, to protect against investigations
where underlying criminal liability falls into
a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrass-
ment. The injury to the integrity of the jus-
tice system is the same regardless of wheth-
er a person committed an underlying
wrong.’’
More specifically, ‘‘the President had
a motive to put the FBI’s Russia inves-
tigation behind him,’’ Mr. Mueller
wrote. ‘‘A thorough FBI investigation
would uncover facts about the cam-
paign and the President personally
that the President could have under-
stood to be crimes or that would give
rise to personal and political con-
cerns.’’
I am quoting directly from the
Mueller report.
For the record, the President did not
fully cooperate with Special Counsel
Mueller’s investigation. The President
refused to sit for an interview. He has
taken every opportunity to say that
this whole process was a witch hunt.
He has done all he can to undermine
the authority of the special counsel, its
investigators, its purpose and, there-
fore, its results.
As Special Counsel Mueller noted in
his final report:
Beginning in December 2017, the [Special
Counsel] sought for more than a year to
interview the President on topics relevant to
both Russian-election interference and ob-
struction-of-justice . . . we received the
President’s written responses . . . we in-
formed counsel of the insufficiency of those
responses in several respects . . . Recog-
nizing that the President would not be inter-
viewed voluntarily, we considered whether to
issue a subpoena for his testimony. We
viewed the written answers to be inadequate.
But at that point, our investigation had
made significant progress and had produced
substantial evidence for our report. We thus
weighed the costs of potentially lengthy con-
stitutional litigation, with resulting delay in
finishing our investigation. . . .
So there is no question that the
President did not cooperate as Mr.
Mueller had requested.
Special Counsel Mueller noted that
he declined to ‘‘make a traditional
prosecutorial judgment’’ due to its ac-
ceptance of the Justice Department’s
Office of Legal Counsel, or OLC, opin-
ion prohibiting the indictment of a sit-
ting President. The special counsel
stated that while the OLC opinion
holds that a sitting President may not
be prosecuted, the OLC opinion ‘‘recog-
nizes that a criminal investigation dur-
ing the President’s term is permissible.
The OLC opinion also recognizes that a
President does not have immunity
after he leaves office. . . . Given those
considerations, the facts known to us,
and the strong public interest in safe-
guarding the integrity of the criminal
justice system, we conducted a thor-
ough factual investigation in order to
preserve the evidence when memories
were fresh and documents materials
were made available.’’
That is ending a quote by the special
counsel. Mr. Mueller’s report is a clear
directive to Congress to move forward
with its own proceedings.
The criminal process at issue here for
a sitting President is completely sepa-
rate and independent of both the con-
gressional oversight power and the con-
gressional impeachment power for high
crimes and misdemeanors. Even if the
House decides to begin impeachment
proceedings against the President—and
it has the sole power to do so—and
even if the Senate were to convict the
President—it has the sole power to do
so—the Constitution provides that
‘‘the Party convicted shall neverthe-
less be liable and subject to Indict-
ment, Trial, Judgment, and Punish-
ment, according to Law.’’
The report emphasizes the Presi-
dent’s constitutional obligation to
faithfully execute the laws under arti-
cle II, section 3 of the Constitution,
and notes that ‘‘the proper supervision
of criminal law does not demand free-
dom for the President to act with a
corrupt intention of shielding himself
from criminal punishment, avoiding fi-
nancial liability, or preventing per-
sonal embarrassment.’’
Congress should take action and con-
vene oversight hearings on the Mueller
report and the underlying evidence.
The report states:
Our investigation found multiple acts by
the President that were capable of exerting
undue influence over law enforcement inves-
tigations, including the Russian-interference
and obstruction investigations. The inci-
dents were often carried out through one-on-
one meetings in which the President sought
to use his official power outside of usual
channels.
These actions ranged from efforts to re-
move the Special Counsel and to reverse the
effect of the Attorney General’s recusal; to
the attempted use of official power to limit
the scope of the investigation; to direct and
indirect contacts with witnesses with the po-
tential to influence their testimony. Viewing
the acts collectively can help illuminate
their significance.
That is again quoting from the
Mueller report.
These are disturbing and troubling
actions by the President. Congress
needs to get to the bottom of what hap-
pened and lay bare the facts for all
Americans to see.
The report continues:
The President’s efforts to influence the in-
vestigation were mostly unsuccessful, but

that is largely because the persons who sur-
rounded the President declined to carry out
orders or accede to his requests. Comey did
not end the investigation of Flynn, which ul-
timately resulted in Flynn’s prosecution and
conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did
not tell Acting Attorney General Rod Rosen-
stein that the Special Counsel must be re-
moved, but was instead prepared to resign
over the President’s order. Lewandowski and
Dearborn did not deliver the President’s
message to Attorney General Sessions that
he should confine the Russia investigation to
future election meddling only. And McGahn
refused to recede from his recollection about
events surrounding the President’s direction
to have the Special Counsel removed, despite
the President’s multiple demands that he do
so.
That is again quoting from the
Mueller report.
The American people can take little
comfort in the fact that the episodes of
potential obstruction of justice would
have been much worse had the Presi-
dent’s staff actually followed through
on his orders. The misconduct here
emanates from the President himself.
The report notes the marked change
in the President’s behavior—after the
firing of FBI Director Comey—once the
President realized that ‘‘investigators
were conducting an obstruction-of-jus-
tice inquiry into his own conduct . . .
The President launched public attacks
on the investigation and individuals in-
volved in it who could possess evidence
adverse to the President, while in pri-
vate, the President engaged in a series
of targeted efforts to control the inves-
tigation.
For instance, the President at-
tempted to remove the special counsel.
He sought to have Attorney General
Sessions unrecuse himself and limit
the investigation. He sought to prevent
public disclosure of information about
the June 9, 2016, meeting between Rus-
sians and campaign officials. And he
used public forms to attack potential
witnesses who might offer adverse in-
formation and to praise witnesses who
declined to cooperate with the govern-
ment.
The report continues:
The conclusion that Congress may apply
the obstruction laws to the President’s cor-
rupt exercise of the powers of office accords
with our constitutional system of checks and
balances and the principle that no person is
above the law. . . . In sum, contrary to the
position taken by the President’s counsel, we
concluded that, in light of the Supreme
Court precedent governing separation-of-
power issues, we have a valid basis for inves-
tigating the conduct at issue in this report.
In our view, the application of the obstruc-
tion statutes would not impermissibly bur-
den the President’s Article II function to su-
pervise prosecutorial conduct or to remove
inferior law enforcement officers.
The report concludes:
The protection of the criminal justice sys-
tem from corrupt acts by any person—in-
cluding the President—accords with the fun-
damental principle of our government that
‘‘no person in this country is so high that he
is above the law.’’
They cited U.S. v. Lee, Clinton v.
Jones, and U.S. v. Nixon.
Congress, through its oversight pow-
ers and constitutional responsibilities,
should closely examine, investigate,
and take testimony on the following
episodes and events relating to poten-
tial obstruction of justice by President
Trump.
The special counsel examined these
episodes in great detail and found sup-
portive documentary and testimonial
evidence that raised significant con-
cerns about potential wrongdoing in a
number of cases, including the Trump
campaign’s response to reports about
Russia’s support for Trump; conduct
involving FBI Director Comey and Na-
tional Security Advisor Michael Flynn;
the President’s reaction to the con-
tinuing Russia investigation; the Presi-
dent’s termination of Comey and ef-
forts to have Rosenstein take responsi-
bility; the appointment of special
counsel and efforts to remove him; ef-
forts to curtail the special counsel’s in-
vestigation; efforts to prevent public
disclosure of evidence or affect witness
cooperation or testimony; further ef-
forts to have Attorney General Ses-
sions take control of the investigation,
after recusal; efforts to have White
House Counsel Don McGahn deny that
the President had ordered him to have
the special counsel removed; conduct
towards Flynn and Manafort; and con-
duct involving Michael Cohen. That is
quite a long list.
Congress should now rise to its con-
stitutional responsibility and conduct
vigorous oversight based on the road-
map provided by the Mueller report,
both as to Russia’s interference in the
2016 Presidential election and efforts to
obstruct justice during the Mueller in-
vestigation.

REAUTHORIZING HEA: ADDRESSING CAMPUS
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ENSURING STUDENT
SAFETY AND RIGHTS
Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senate Committee
on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
will please come to order. Senator Murray
and I will each have an opening statement,
and then we will introduce the witnesses.
After the witnesses’ testimony, senators will
each have 5 minutes of questions.
Today’s hearing will focus on how colleges
and universities should respond to accusa-
tions of sexual assault. This is an important
and difficult topic. For that reason, I am
glad that Senator Murray and I have been
able to agree to a bipartisan hearing and to
agree on the witnesses.
On these issues, I have the perspective of a
father of daughters and sons, of a grand-
father, a lawyer, a governor, and also a
former Chairman of the Board and president
of a large public university. As a university
administrator, my first priority always was
the safety of students. My goal was to quick-
ly and compassionately respond to victims of
alleged assaults, offering counseling and
other support, including assisting the victim
if he or she wished to report the assault to
law enforcement. And my goal also was to
protect the rights of both the accused and
the victim to ensure that campus discipli-
nary processes were fair.
If you are an administrator at one of 6,000
American colleges and universities and you
ask your legal counsel what laws the institu-
tion must follow when it comes to allega-
tions of sexual assault, your counsel would
reply that there are several places to look.
First, you would look to federal statutes.
Two federal laws govern allegations of sex-
ual assault. All colleges and universities
that receive federal funds, including federal
financial aid, must follow them. First, Title
IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972,
which states ‘‘no person in the United States
shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any
education program or activity.’’ In 1999, the
Supreme Court ruled in Davis v. Monroe
County Board of Education that student-on-
student sexual harassment is covered by
Title IX.
And second, the Clery Act, as amended in
2013 by the Violence Against Women Act,
which requires colleges to have ‘‘procedures
for institutional disciplinary action in cases
of alleged domestic violence, dating violence,
sexual assault, or stalking.’’
The law mandates ‘‘such proceedings shall
provide a prompt, fair, and impartial inves-
tigation and resolution’’ and ‘‘the accuser
and the accused are entitled to the same op-
portunities to have others present during an
institutional disciplinary proceeding, includ-
ing the opportunity to be accompanied to
any related meeting or proceeding by an ad-
visor of their choice.’’ That advisor may be a
lawyer. The law also requires institutions to
state in their procedures ‘‘the standard of
evidence that will be used during any insti-
tutional conduct proceeding,’’ but it did not
say what that standard had to be.
Next your counsel would refer you to regu-
lations based upon these two federal laws.
These regulations also have the force of law.
First, the relevant regulation under Title IX
requires schools to have a disciplinary proc-
ess which is defined in the regulation as ‘‘a
grievance procedure providing for [a] prompt
and equitable resolution.’’
Regulations under the Clery Act define a
‘‘prompt, fair, and impartial proceeding.’’
Under these regulations, the institution
‘‘may establish restrictions regarding the ex-
tent to which the advisor of choice may par-
ticipate in the proceedings.’’ Your counsel
will also tell you that sometimes the U.S.
Department of Education will send out a let-
ter or guidance to institutions, giving its in-
terpretation of what a law or regulation
might mean. Such letters or guidance do not
have the force of law; they are only advisory.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2603
May 2, 2019
But campuses sometimes consider them
binding as a law and unfortunately Depart-
ment officials have, in the past, made the
same mistake.
For example, in 2011 and 2014, during the
Obama Administration, officials at the U.S.
Department of Education wrote two guid-
ance letters interpreting Title IX, saying, in
deciding whether an accused student is
guilty of sexual assault, the decider ‘‘must
use a preponderance of the evidence stand-
ard.’’
It was no surprise that many campuses
thought this interpretation was the law be-
cause the Department acted as if it were the
law, when it was only advisory. On June 26,
2014, at a hearing before this Committee, I
asked the former Assistant Secretary for
Civil Rights at the Department of Education,
Catherine Lhamon,’’do you expect institu-
tions to comply with your Title IX guidance
documents?’’ She responded, ‘‘We do.’’
In September 2017, Secretary DeVos with-
drew both of these letters of guidance and a
year later, in November of last year, pro-
posed to replace them with a new rule under
Title IX, a process which allows extensive
comment and discussion and would have the
force of law when it is final.
That is not all your legal counsel would
tell you. If you’re the president of a public
institution—where 80 percent of undergradu-
ates attend college—your counsel would re-
mind you that your disciplinary process
must meet the standards of the 14th Amend-
ment to the United States Constitution
which says ‘‘nor shall any state deprive any
person or life, liberty, or property without
due process of law.’’
And then finally you’d have to look at any
applicable state laws. For example, if you
are an administrator at one of Tennessee’s
public colleges, the state’s Uniform Adminis-
trative Procedures Act mandates that at
public colleges and universities a student
facing suspension or expulsion must be given
the option to have a full administrative
hearing with the right to counsel and ‘‘the
opportunity to . . . conduct cross-examina-
tion.’’
This array of laws and regulations creates
a challenge for college administrators, for
students who allege an assault, and for those
who are accused to know what the law re-
quires, so the purpose of today’s hearing is to
hear how we can create more certainty in
how colleges and universities should appro-
priately and fairly respond to allegations of
sexual assault. During this hearing, I would
like to focus on three issues raised by the
Department’s proposed rule: The require-
ments of due process, including cross exam-
ination; the effect of the location of the al-
leged assault; and The definition of sexual
harassment.
According to an article published by the
Cornell Law Review, more than 100 lawsuits
have been filed by students accused of sexual
assault who claim schools denied them due
process. In one lawsuit, an accused student
sued Brandeis University. The opinion of the
judge of the U.S. District Court for the Dis-
trict of Massachusetts criticized the Depart-
ment of Education’s earlier 2011 guidance for
causing schools to adopt unfair procedures
saying:
‘‘In recent years, universities across the
United States have adopted procedural and
substantive policies intended to make it
easier for victims of sexual assault to make
and prove their claims and for the schools to
adopt punitive measures in response. That
process has been substantially spurred by
the Office for Civil Rights of the Department
of Education, which issued a ‘Dear Col-
league’ letter in 2011 demanding that univer-
sities do so or face a loss of federal funding.
The goal of reducing sexual assault, and pro-
viding appropriate discipline for offenders, is
certainly laudable. Whether the elimination
of basic procedural protections—and the sub-
stantially increased risk that innocent stu-
dents will be punished—is a fair price to
achieve that goal is another question alto-
gether.’’
In February of this year, Supreme Court
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the Atlan-
tic, ‘‘There’s been criticism of some college
codes of conduct for not giving the accused
person a fair opportunity to be heard, and
that’s one of the basic tenets of our system,
as you know, everyone deserves a fair hear-
ing.’’
In an attempt to meet that requirement,
the Department’s proposed rule would re-
quire institutions to hold a ‘‘live hearing,’’
which is defined as a hearing in which ‘‘the
decision-maker must permit each party to
ask the other party and any witnesses all
relevant questions and follow-up questions,
including those challenging credibility. Such
cross-examination at the hearing must be
conducted by the party’s advisor of choice.’’
The proposed rule would allow parties who
do not feel comfortable being in the same
room with each other to request to be in sep-
arate rooms, visible by a video feed, for ex-
ample. This definition of a live hearing
aligns with recent decisions by the U.S.
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and a Cali-
fornia State Court of Appeals.
In the Sixth Circuit case, a student ac-
cused of sexual assault sued the University
of Michigan, alleging the school violated the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment when it did not hold a hearing
with the opportunity for the accused to
cross-examine his accuser and other wit-
nesses. The Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of
the accused student stating: ‘‘if a public uni-
versity has to choose between competing
narratives to resolve a case, the university
must give the accused student or his agent
an opportunity to cross-examine the accuser
and adverse witnesses in the presence of a
neutral fact-finder.’’
And in California, the State Court of Ap-
peals for the Second District made a similar
finding, stating: ‘‘when a student accused of
sexual misconduct faces severe disciplinary
sanctions, and the credibility of witnesses
. . . is central to the adjudication of the alle-
gation, fundamental fairness requires, at a
minimum, that the university provide a
mechanism by which the accused may
cross—examine those witnesses, directly or
indirectly, at a hearing in which the wit-
nesses appear in person or by other means.’’
Some college administrators have said to
me, I do not want to turn our campus into a
courtroom. Others point out that the re-
quirements of fairness and due process often
require inconvenient administrative bur-
dens. It seems to me that the question before
us is, how can the law satisfy the Constitu-
tional requirements of Due Process without
imposing unnecessary administrative bur-
dens and expense on higher education insti-
tutions.
A second issue is the location of the al-
leged assault. The proposed rule requires
schools to respond to an allegation of sexual
assault even if it is off-campus if the ‘‘con-
duct occurs within [an institution’s] edu-
cation program or activity.’’ For example,
the proposed rule cites a federal district
court in Kansas that held that Kansas State
University was required to respond to an al-
legation of sexual assault that occurred at
an off-campus fraternity house because the
house was university-recognized and the
school exercised oversight over the frater-
nity. There is some question about the defi-
nition of university program or activity. And
a second question is if a university can
choose to go beyond university programs or
activities to protect their students.
The third issue is how federal law or regu-
lation should define sexual harassment. The
proposed rule uses a definition established by
the United States Supreme Court in 1999 in
the case Davis v. Monroe County Board of
Education, which requires the conduct to be
‘‘so severe, pervasive, and objectively offen-
sive that it effectively denies a person equal
access to the [institution’s] education pro-
gram or activity.’’ Some have suggested we
look at other definitions in federal law or
Supreme Court precedent.
In the future, regulations with the force of
law and guidance letters that are merely ad-
visory will continue to interpret federal laws
and constitutional requirements governing
allegations of sexual assault on campus. But
as Congress seeks to reauthorize the Higher
Education Act this year, we should do our
best to agree on ways to clarify these three
issues. The more we do that the more cer-
tainty and stability we will give to the law
governing how institutions of higher edu-
cation should respond to accusations of sex-
ual assault.

FAFSA
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that a copy of
my opening statement at the Senate
Health Education, Labor, and Pensions
Committee be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
FAFSA SIMPLIFICATION HEARING
Mr. ALEXANDER. There are not many
things that United States senators can do to
cause 20 million American families to say,
‘‘thank you.’’
After five years of work, we are ready to do
just that by reducing the Free Application
for Federal Student Aid—the FAFSA—from
108 questions to two dozen, and eliminate the
need for families to give their financial in-
formation to the federal government twice.
This will help 400,000 families in Tennessee,
350,000 families in Senator Murray’s Wash-
ington State, and millions more for each of
us who have it in our hands to finish our
work on simplifying the FAFSA.
A volunteer mentor with Tennessee Prom-
ise, which is our state’s program that pro-
vides two years of free community college,
told me that the FAFSA—the form that 20
million families fill out each year to apply
for federal student aid—has a ‘‘chilling ef-
fect’’ on students and on parents.
The former president of Southwest Ten-
nessee Community College in Memphis told
me he believes that he loses 1,500 students
each semester because the FAFSA is too
complicated.
East Tennessee State University said a
third of their applicants—approximately
10,000—are selected each year for
verification—a complicated process that
stops Pell Grant payments while a student
and their family scrambles to submit their
federal tax information or prove they did not
have to file taxes.
Former Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam
told me that Tennessee has the highest rate
of filling out the FAFSA, but it is still the
single biggest impediment to more students
enrolling in Tennessee Promise.
And one of the questions I hear most from
students is, can you please make it simpler
to apply for federal aid?
Five years ago at a hearing before this
Committee we heard that the vast majority
of questions on the FAFSA are unnecessary.
I asked if the four witnesses could each
write a letter to the Committee recom-
mending how they would simplify the
FAFSA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2604 May 2, 2019
The witnesses looked at each other and
said, we don’t have to write you four let-
ters—we can write you one letter because we
agree.
And Senator Bennet, who was on the Com-
mittee at the time, said, if that’s true, and if
there’s that much agreement, why don’t we
do what you recommend?
So we started talking with other Senators,
students, college administrators, and other
experts about how to simplify the FAFSA.
Simplifying the FAFSA started gaining
traction.
First, the Obama Administration allowed
families to fill out the FAFSA using their
tax information from the previous year so
they could apply to school in the fall, rather
than having to wait until spring.
Second, the Trump Administration has put
the FAFSA application on a phone app. I was
at Sevier County High School in November
and saw students zipping through the
FAFSA on their iPhones.
Third, last year the Senate passed legisla-
tion Senator Murray and I introduced that
allows students to answer up to 22 questions
on the FAFSA with just one click and will
stop requiring students to give the same in-
formation to the federal government twice.
We are working with the House to see if we
can make that a law this year.
The final step should be our bipartisan so-
lution that will reduce the number of ques-
tions on the FAFSA from 108 to 15–25 ques-
tions.
In 2015, Senator Bennet and I, along with
Senators Booker, Burr, King, Enzi, Warner,
and Isakson, introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion that would have reduced the number of
FAFSA questions to two. But after discus-
sions with college administrators and states,
we realized we needed to keep some ques-
tions or states and schools would have to
create their own additional forms that stu-
dents would need to fill out.
Over the last four years, we have improved
that legislation and now believe we can move
forward with bipartisan legislation that
would reduce the FAFSA to 15–25 questions.
Here is what all of these improvements
mean to the 20 million families that fill out
the FAFSA every year:
One: Reduce the 108 questions to 15–25.
Two: Dramatically decrease the number of
students selected for verification, because
students’ tax data would automatically
transfer to the Department of Education
which would greatly reduce the need for
verification.
Three: Simplifying the form and the
verification process should encourage more
students to apply for federal aid, which will
ensure that eligible students receive the Pell
they deserve.
Four: Students can now complete the
FAFSA on their iPhone.
Five: Families can now apply for federal
student aid sooner because they can use in-
formation from their last year’s tax return;
and
Six: Students can find out as early as
eighth grade how much Pell grant funding
they may be eligible for.
And seven: there is a $6 billion advantage
to taxpayers—that is the amount the Depart-
ment of Education estimates is issued in im-
proper payments every year
These are seven huge advantages and are
the result of five years of hearings and work
by senators, and work by both the Obama
and Trump Administrations. Bipartisan dis-
cussions have produced a lot of agreement on
simplifying the number of questions, so the
purpose of this hearing is to learn what we
need to know before taking the final step.
I also hear from students—can you make
repaying student loans simpler?
A large number of Republican and Demo-
crat senators have suggested streamlining
the nine ways to repay student loans, includ-
ing Senators Warner, King, Rubio, Merkley,
Burr and Baldwin.
I have proposed having just two ways to
repay student loans:
One, a plan based on a borrower’s income,
which would never require the borrower to
make payments of more than ten percent of
his or her discretionary income. If a bor-
rower wanted to pay off their loan, the other
option would be a 10–year payment plan,
with equal monthly payments, similar to a
10–year mortgage. And under both options, a
borrower’s payment would come directly
from their paycheck.
This proposal would make it easier for
more than 9 million borrowers annually, and
any of the current 42 million borrowers with
outstanding federal loan debt, to take advan-
tage of a simpler and more affordable way to
repay their loans.
And from administrators I hear—can’t you
do something about the administrative bur-
den that wastes time and money that could
instead be spent on students?
To help administrators overwhelmed by
what the Kirwan-Zeppos report called ‘‘a
jungle of red tape,’’ I am proposing we sim-
plify federal regulations that take time and
money away from educating students.
There are other steps this Committee is
considering to make college worth students’
time and money, but we also have the oppor-
tunity to greatly simplify the ‘‘chilling ef-
fect’’ applying for federal aid has on students
today.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
REMEMBERING ED SCULLY
∑ Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor the life and service of a
distinguished Delawarean, veteran of
the U.S. Army for 27 years, business-
man, husband, father, grandfather,
great-grandfather, and brother, Ed
Scully.
I got to know Ed during my time as
New Castle County executive and
worked with him on a variety of issues
facing the aviation industry.
Ed was known for his persistence
during my time in the Senate when it
came to bringing and keeping good,
high-paying jobs in Delaware, and in
particular, he was passionate about
helping veterans in our State get jobs
in the aviation industry.
After graduating from Wilmington,
Delaware’s Salesianum School, Ed
joined the U.S. Army in February 1961.
Ed was no ordinary soldier; he joined
the Special Forces and earned his
Green Beret. He was promoted five
times during his 27 years of service and
retired at the rank of lieutenant colo-
nel. Ed received many awards and deco-
rations, including the Legion of Merit,
the Bronze Star with Valor, the Purple
Heart, the Joint Services Meritorious
Service Medal, the Air Medal, the Com-
bat Infantryman’s Badge, the Special
Forces Tab, the Parachute Badge, the
Senior Aviation Badge, the Vietnam
Jump Wings, and the Special Forces
Combat Patch.
After attending flight school, avia-
tion became Ed’s passion, and he spent
the rest of his life as a military and ci-
vilian aviation expert.
After he retired from the military
and returned to Delaware, he began a
second career at Summit Aviation, a
500-acre airport in Middletown, DE,
where he continued supporting Amer-
ica’s men and women in uniform. Sum-
mit was an early supporter of the Dela-
ware State Police Aviation Branch,
building a hangar and providing all air-
craft maintenance. To this day, Sum-
mit is a top employer of veterans in
the state. Ed retired from Summit in
June, 2013, after 25 years. Prior to his
retirement, Summit named their new
modification center after him: the
Scully Modification Center. There are
few people who can say that they have
dedicated their lives to their country,
but Ed certainly can.
Sadly, Ed passed away on December
24, 2018, and was buried in Arlington
National Cemetery, but he leaves be-
hind an indelible legacy and one he
should be most proud of: his family. Ed
is survived by his loving and devoted
wife of 45 years, Patricia, his brothers
Robert and Thomas, his daughters, Su-
zanne Gubich, Corynn Ciber, Kristin
Stein, his son Edward Scully IV, and
his grandchildren and great-grand-
children; Danielle, Cole, Kyle, Maxwell,
Julia, Connor, Ashton, and Kailani.
I am grateful for Ed’s service to our
State and our Nation, and I hope that
this tribute to his memory helps his
family and friends know what an im-
pact his life made.∑

THE GULLAH SOCIETY’S
ANCESTRAL REBURIAL CEREMONY
∑ Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr.
President, today I would like to com-
memorate and recognize a weekend-
long event happening in a place I hold
very near and dear to my heart, my
hometown, Charleston, SC. In 2013, 36
bodies were discovered and unearthed
near Anson Street in downtown
Charleston. After years of further his-
torical, archeological and DNA anal-
ysis research, we have learned much
more about the stories of these men,
women, and children.
Buried between 1750 and 1800, these
people of African descent—some born
in Africa, others born in South Caro-
lina—most likely were enslaved indi-
viduals who helped build the nearby
port of Charleston. This weekend, 6
years after unearthing these individ-
uals and more than 250 years after they
were buried, the Gullah Society and
the Charleston community are coming
together to hold a naming ceremony,
official release of DNA ancestry re-
sults, a reburial ceremony, and an ecu-
menical service.
It is the hope of the Gullah Society,
a hope shared with myself and many
fellow Charlestonians, that we lay
these individuals to rest the proper
way, as well as remember, celebrate,
and honor them. While we recognize
these 36 ancestral sons and daughters
of South Carolina, we also will have a
chance to remember all others whose
graves have been lost and all others

upon whose backs Charleston was
built.
While Charleston’s past is certainly
complicated, I believe events like this
serve to inspire us all to create a fu-
ture of greater reconciliation, truth
telling, equality, and healing in our
shared community. I thank the Gullah
Society and all individuals who helped
create or participated in this project,
as I believe they do so for the true ben-
efit and education of us all.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–33. A joint memorial adopted by the
Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the
United States Congress to pass legislation
that designates 611 as a national suicide pre-
vention and mental health crisis hotline
telephone number; to the Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
HOUSE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 1
Whereas, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) reported 45,000 deaths
by suicide in the United States in 2016, with
rates of suicide since 1999 increasing in every
state; and
Whereas, the CDC reported that suicide is
the tenth leading cause of death in the
United States, and ode of just three of the
leading causes of death that are on the rise;
and
Whereas, Idaho and other western states
have the highest rates of suicide in the na-
tion, and the CDC reports that the rate of
suicide is increasing in Idaho and sur-
rounding western states by rates that range
from 30% to 58% since 1999; and
Whereas, the United States faces an urgent
public health crisis as these deaths con-
tribute to the declining life expectancy for
Americans; and
Whereas, the United States House of Rep-
resentatives passed H.R. 2345, the National
Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, by
a vote of 379 to 1, with both Congressman
Raúl Labrador and Congressman Mike Simp-
son voting in the affirmative; and the United
States Senate passed H.R. 2345 by unanimous
consent; and
Whereas, on August 14, 2018, President
Donald Trump signed H.R. 2345 into law as
Public Law No. 115–233; and
Whereas, Public Law 115–233 requires the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
to conduct a study that examines the feasi-
bility of designating a simple, easy-to-re-
member, three-digit dialing code to be used
for a national suicide prevention and mental
health crisis hotline system; and
Whereas, the FCC’s report must rec-
ommend whether a particular Nil dialing
code or another simple, easy-to-remember,
three-digit dialing code should be used for a
national suicide prevention and mental
health crisis hotline system and, if so, the
logistics and costs associated with desig-
nating such a dialing code; and
Whereas, 611 is the only undesignated N11
number available, and in 1997, the FCC found
that 611 would be available when ‘‘needed for
other national purposes’’; and
Whereas, since 1968, 911 has been used for
emergency service, and the simplicity and
ubiquity of the 911 dialing code makes the
N11 pattern the most logical pattern to fol-
low for a national suicide prevention and
mental health crisis hotline: Now, therefore,
be it
Resolved by the members of the First Reg-
ular Session of the Sixty-fifth Idaho Legisla-
ture, the House of Representatives and the
Senate concurring therein, that the FCC
should recognize that combating the stag-
gering growth of suicide deaths is an impor-
tant national purpose; and be it further
Resolved, that, in response to the growing
rate of suicide deaths, the FCC should des-
ignate 611 as the new national suicide pre-
vention and mental health crisis hotline
telephone number; and be it further
Resolved, that if the FCC does not make
such a designation, the delegation rep-
resenting the State of Idaho in Congress is
hereby respectfully requested to pursue leg-
islation to that end; and be it further

Resolved, that the Chief Clerk of the House
of Representatives be, and she is hereby au-
thorized and directed to forward a copy of
this Memorial to the Chairman of the Fed-
eral Communications Commission, the Presi-
dent of the United States Senate, the Speak-
er of the United States House of Representa-

representing the State of Idaho in the Con-

POM–34. A joint memorial adopted by the
Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the
United States Congress to support the Fed-
eral Communications Commission’s actions
to provide the resources necessary to im-
prove the phone communications system; to
the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation.
HOUSE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 3
Whereas, communication is essential to
Idaho’s economy for conducting business, so-
cial interaction, and emergency contacts;
and
Whereas, phone communication, and par-
ticularly cell phone communication and re-
lated uses, is subject to distraction, disrup-
tion, and interference as a result of un-
wanted and unsolicited phone calls from re-
cordings and persons who do not identify
themselves and use false phone numbers to
promote warranties, health products, credit
cards, computer repair, and many products
they have no intention of providing; and
Whereas, the unscrupulous and dishonest
use of our phone communication system is
becoming so frequent that it interferes with
commerce because increasingly users do not
answer the phone, missing legitimate and
important calls; and
Whereas, Idaho state statutes, do not call
registries, and other remedies have become
ineffective because those who engage in this
misbehavior have no intention of obeying
the law and are able to avoid being appre-
hended or detected because they are calling
from locations outside of the United States
or, if calling within the United States, they
use sophisticated hacking methods; and
Whereas, Idaho state and local govern-
ments do not have the expertise to control
the increasing burden upon Idaho citizens
and particularly do not have the jurisdiction
to pursue offshore illegal activities; Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved by the members of the First Reg-
ular Session of the Sixty-fifth Idaho Legisla-
ture, the House of Representatives and the
Senate concurring therein, that we support
the citizens of the State of Idaho and request
that the Federal Communications Commis-
sion, with the support and assistance of our
congressional delegation, provide the re-
sources necessary and take every reasonable
step to procure the necessary expertise to
prosecute and end this interference and mis-
use of our communications system; and be it
further
Resolved that the Chief Clerk of the House
of Representatives be, and she is hereby au-
thorized and directed to forward a copy of
this Memorial to the President of the Senate
and the Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives of Congress, to the congressional dele-
gation representing the State of Idaho in the
Congress of the United States, and to the
Federal Communications Commission.
POM–35. A joint memorial adopted by the
Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration to practice all expediency toward the
completion of the Incidental Take Permit re-
quired for the lawful operation of Idaho’s
Steelhead fishing season; to the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
HOUSE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 9
Whereas, all runs of Idaho’s wild Steelhead
were listed in 1997 as threatened under the
Endangered Species Act; and
Whereas, many conditions originating out-
side of Idaho have contributed to the decline
of Idaho’s wild Steelhead; and
Whereas, in spite of collaborative habitat
restoration projects and thoughtful fisheries
management within Idaho, these external
impacts continue to affect wild Steelhead re-
turns; and
Whereas, longitudinal scientific research
clearly and consistently negates the notion
that the operation of the Steelhead fishing
season has any appreciable effect on the
abundance or recovery of Idaho’s wild
Steelhead; and
Whereas, the hatchery Steelhead fishery
constitutes a significant part of Idaho’s rec-
reational and tribal fishery; and
Whereas, the Steelhead fishery is a signifi-
cant contributor to the culture, jobs, tour-
ism, recreation, and economy of Idaho; and
Whereas, Steelhead fishing by the outfitted
and nonoutfitted public on Idaho’s rivers is a
significant contributor to Idaho’s rural econ-
omy; and
Whereas, Idaho submitted its Fisheries
Management and Evaluation Plan for review
and renewal to the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (NOAA) in 2010,
prior to the expiration of the associated per-
mit required for lawful operation of its fish-
eries; and
Whereas, NOAA still has not, in the nine
years since submission, processed that plan
and renewed Idaho’s Incidental Take Permit;
and
Whereas, this has placed the State of Idaho
fisheries out of legal compliance; and
Whereas, on December 7, 2018, under threat
of a federal lawsuit by six organizations due
to Idaho operating its fisheries without a
current federal permit, the Idaho Depart-
ment of Fish and Game (IDFG) Commission
decided to suspend the Steelhead fishing sea-
son; and
Whereas, the IDFG Commission’s decision
of December 7, 2018, to strike a conditional
agreement with the litigant coalition fore-
stalled a full closure of the Steelhead season;
and
Whereas, the terms of said agreement are
set to expire on March 15, 2019, or upon
verified completion of the requisite permit,
whichever should occur first; and
Whereas, we commend the Idaho congres-
sional delegation for its letter to NOAA urg-
ing rapid permit renewal and for its influ-
ence and support; and
Whereas, if the permit is not completed by
March 15, 2019, it is possible that those areas
that have remained open thus far might be
closed and that those areas that the Decem-
ber agreement excluded remain closed for
the remainder of the Steelhead season; and
Whereas, initial statements made in early
December 2018 by NOAA officials projected
that the permit would be completed by
early-to-mid February; and
Whereas, the record 35-day shutdown of the
federal government, agencies, and non-
essential employees significantly delayed
progress toward completing the permit; and
Whereas, NOAA officials have now indi-
cated they will attempt to complete the per-
mit before March 15, 2019, but they remain
unwilling to commit that they will do so in
time: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the members of the First Reg-
ular Session of the Sixty-fifth Idaho Legisla-
ture, the House of Representatives and the
Senate concurring therein, that we urge
NOAA, and specifically the National Marine
Fishery Service division, to practice all ex-
pediency toward the completion of the Inci-
dental Take Permit required for the lawful
operation of Idaho’s Steelhead fishing sea-
son; and be it further
Resolved that NOAA is urged to review fu-
ture Fisheries Management and Evaluation
Plans and process permit renewal applica-
tions submitted by the State of Idaho in a
time frame that does not place the state out
of legal compliance and that inherently puts
the operation of Idaho’s Steelhead fisheries
at risk and all that rely upon the fisheries
and are otherwise ancillary to them; and be
it further
Resolved that nothing in this Joint Memo-
rial is intended to conflict with the respon-
sible evaluation, nor to the exclusion and
consideration of the best available science,
of the permit; and be it further
Resolved that the Chief Clerk of the House
of Representatives be, and she is hereby au-
thorized and directed to forward a copy of
this Memorial to the President of the Senate
and the Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives of Congress, to the congressional dele-
gation representing the State of Idaho in the
Congress of the United States, to NOAA, and
to the National Marine Fishery Service divi-
sion of NOAA.
POM–36. A concurrent memorial adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona
urging the United States Congress to decline
to designate the Great Bend of the Gila
River and surrounding areas as a National
Monument; to the Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources.
HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 2005
Whereas, the Gila River stretches nearly
600 miles across Arizona and has supported
Arizona’s people for thousands of years; and
Whereas, Congressman Raúl M. Grijalva
introduced H.R. 6521, the Great Bend of the
Gila National Monument Establishment Act
(Act) on July 25, 2018; and
Whereas, national monument status has
significant potential consequences that may
negatively affect land management activi-
ties; and
Whereas, the proposed Great Bend of the
Gila National Monument includes more than
84,000 acres of land along the Gila River in
southwestern Arizona; and
Whereas, existing laws and regulations, in-
cluding the National Environmental Policy
Act, the Federal Land Policy and Manage-
ment Act, the Archaeological Resources Pro-
tection Act and many others, ensure the pro-
tection and responsible use of the Great
Bend of the Gila River and its surrounding
lands; and
Whereas, as of 2012, Arizona had the third
highest total designated wilderness acreage
in the United States with 4.5 million acres.
Additionally, another 5.8 million acres were
affected by special land use designations, in-
cluding national monuments; and
Whereas, the Act allows the United States
Secretary of the Interior to adjust the
boundaries of the Great Bend of the Gila Na-
tional Monument after enactment of the Act
to include any ‘‘significant archaeological
resources discovered.’’ The Act does not in-
clude standards or requirements related to
such inclusion, leaving the boundaries of the
monument virtually unknown; and
Whereas, the Act also allows the Secretary
of the Interior to acquire land, both state
and private, within or adjacent to the bound-
aries of the national monument. Land and
interest in land automatically become part
of the national monument; and
Whereas, the Act removes all Great Bend
of the Gila National Monument land from fu-
ture sale, mining, mineral and geothermal
leasing, and renewable energy and other eco-
nomic development; and
Whereas, by preventing economic activity
that generates income and tax revenue, na-
tional monument designation will have
sweeping consequences for infrastructure,
job creation and economic growth in sur-
rounding areas and across this state; and

May 2, 2019
Whereas, imposing federal preservation
management on Arizona lands obstructs this
state’s land management objectives and
principles; and
Whereas, whether the federal government
consults with this state in developing and
implementing a management plan for the
Great Bend of the Gila National Monument
is at the discretion of the Secretary of the
Interior; and
Whereas, national monument designation
results in some of the most restrictive exist-
ing land use regulations, greatly impacting
travel and hunting, fishing and other rec-
reational activities; and
Whereas, congressional designation of mul-
tiple use policy as per the Federal Land Man-
agement Policy Act is best for our citizens
and Arizona’s economy.
Wherefore your memorialist, the House of
Representatives of the State of Arizona, the
Senate concurring, prays:
1. That the United States Congress decline
to designate the Great Bend of the Gila
River and the surrounding areas as a na-
tional monument.
2. That the United States Congress accept
public input before designating another na-
tional monument in this state.
3. That the United States Congress and
President of the United States allow this
state to provide express approval before fed-
eral designation of any new monuments, in-

POM–37. A concurrent memorial adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona
urging the United States Congress to act to
prohibit federal agencies from recom-
mending and identifying Arizona’s public
lands as wilderness areas without express
congressional consent; to the Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources.
HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 2007
Whereas, through federal land manage-
ment planning and associated guidelines,
federal agencies are recommending and iden-
tifying Arizona’s public lands as wilderness
areas; and
Whereas, these administratively rec-
ommended wilderness areas circumvent con-
gressional intent and lack full and appro-
priate National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) analyses; and
Whereas, the identification of these de
facto wilderness areas has resulted in signifi-
cant restrictions on public access and recre-
ation, paralyzing constraints on the Arizona
Game and Fish Department’s ability to man-
age wildlife and potentially catastrophic
limits on vegetation and habitat improve-
ment projects, including fire management
activities; and
Whereas, the conservation of wildlife re-
sources is the trust responsibility of the Ari-
zona Game and Fish Commission, and this
responsibility extends to all lands within Ar-
izona to ensure abundant wildlife resources
for current and future generations; and
Whereas, the designation of Arizona’s pub-
lic lands as wilderness areas has resulted in
the erosion of the Arizona Game and Fish
Department’s ability to comply with its fed-
eral mandate to proactively recover threat-
ened and endangered species; and
Whereas, according to federal land man-
agement agency guidelines, an administra-
tively recommended wilderness area must be
managed to ‘‘protect and maintain the social
and ecological characteristics that provide
the basis for wilderness recommendation’’ in
perpetuity or until Congress takes action to
formally designate the area as a wilderness
area; and
Whereas, allowable activities within ad-
ministratively recommended wilderness
areas are left to the discretion of federal
staff and deciding officers, resulting in even
greater restrictions and hindrances than
those formally vetted and designated by Con-
gress; and
Whereas, congressionally designated wil-
derness provides clearer guidance for man-
agement and coordination with this state,
specific processes for wildlife management
exemptions and direction for collaboration
via existing state agreements and guidelines;
and
Whereas, administratively recommended
wilderness areas lack transparency and cir-
cumvent the spirit of NEPA and congres-
sional intent; and
Whereas, with the implementation of fed-
eral land management plans, recommended
wilderness areas constitute a significant and
immediate change in management without a
fully disclosed impact analysis required by
NEPA; and
Whereas, the federal land management
plans lack full NEPA disclosure of potential
impacts to this state and the public, assur-
ances protecting this state’s ability to
proactively manage wildlife and fulfill its
public trust responsibility, including specific
management activities, and analyses of the
cumulative impacts of further loss of public
lands that provide for multiple-use and wild-
life-related recreational and economic oppor-
tunities; and
Whereas, the areas being recommended as
wilderness were not included within the
original wilderness designations with pur-
poseful intent by Congress; and
Whereas, the subsequent expansion of pre-
viously designated wilderness is an over-
reach of the federal agencies and disingen-
uous to the public, subverting original col-
laboration, coordination, negotiation and
agreements; and
Whereas, the federal agency planning docu-
ments suggest that significant management
action or recommendation to Congress will
not take place before further NEPA analyses
are completed. Within the Prescott and
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest rec-
ommended wildernesses, the United States
Forest Service indicates that these areas are
simply preliminary administrative rec-
ommendations and that further NEPA anal-
yses are necessary. However, in transmittal
letters, the United States Forest Service
states that ‘‘the Final Environmental Im-
pact Statement for the . . . Forest’s Revised
Resource Management Plan contains the
NEPA analysis necessary to support a legis-
lative proposal.’’ This suggests the necessary
NEPA analysis has been conducted without
adequate public engagement and is an egre-
gious lack of transparency.
Wherefore your memorialist, the House of
Representatives of the State of Arizona, the
Senate concurring, prays:
1. That the Congress of the United States
act to prohibit federal agencies from recom-
mending and identifying Arizona’s public
lands as wilderness areas without express
congressional consent and state and local
consent.
2. That the Secretary of State of the State
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial
to the President of the United States Senate,
the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives and each Member of Con-
gress from the State of Arizona.

Whereas, Idaho’s legal description includes
approximately 53.5 million acres, of which
approximately 5,008,317 acres are designated
as Wilderness Areas and approximately
1,797,456 acres have at some point been des-
ignated as Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs),
which are maintained similarly to Wilder-
ness Areas; and
Whereas, in 1976, Congress passed the Fed-
eral Land Policy and Management Act
(FLPMA) with Section 603 directing the Bu-
reau of Land Management (BLM) to identify
and review all the public lands under its ad-
ministration that possess the wilderness
characteristics described in the Wilderness
Act; and
Whereas, the BLM state director, after
analysis, stated in his 1991 Record of Deci-
sion and Idaho Wilderness Study Report,
‘‘The recommendation is for Congress to des-
ignate 972,239 acres as wilderness and release
825,217 acres for other multiple uses’’; and
Whereas, the President in 1992 wrote a let-
ter to the Speaker of the House and the
President of the Senate saying, ‘‘. . . I fur-
ther concur with the Secretary of the Inte-
rior that all or part of 57 of the WSAs encom-
passing 825,217 acres are not suitable for
preservation as wilderness . . . I urge the
Congress to act expeditiously and favorably
on the proposed legislation so that the nat-
ural resources of these WSAs in Idaho may
be protected and preserved’’; and
Whereas, Congress, through Public Law
111–11 separately removed thousands of acres
of nonsuitable WSAs in 2009, and through
Public Law 114–46, separately removed tens
of thousands of acres of nonsuitable WSAs in
2015, there are still over 500,000 acres of non-
suitable WSAs in Idaho; and
Whereas, these Idaho lands are in legal
limbo, a situation that causes extensive fed-
eral litigation regarding what uses of the
lands are appropriate and, in turn, places a
burden on federal court resources; and
Whereas, uncertainty and wide swings in
executive branch philosophy regarding the
administration of these lands are costing the
public millions of dollars as forest assets
burn and deteriorate and as investments in
forest road construction and improvements
are being minimized; and
Whereas, administrative decisions and
preservationist lawsuits have progressively
reduced access to public lands for forest
managers and the public; and
Whereas, the long-term sustainability of
public lands depends on good stewardship
and professional scientific site-specific man-
agement of forest resources; and
Whereas, Idaho’s historic heritage, cus-
toms, and culture are linked to the proper
stewardship and use of the state’s natural re-
sources located on federally managed lands;
and
Whereas, these lands are de facto wilder-
ness in lieu of congressional action, a situa-
tion that has resulted in a waste of forest as-
sets, improper management of public forests,
and a harmful reduction in forest road con-
struction and multiple-use access improve-
ments; and
Whereas, the failure by Congress to release

Whereas, national forest lands released
from wilderness study would still be subject
to the National Forest Management Act,
which requires extensive early state political
subdivision and public involvement as a fed-
eral land management agency develops,
monitors, assesses, and updates plans for the
management and use of resources in each
forest; and
Whereas, the Idaho Legislature, on behalf
of the citizens of the state, asserts that the
time is ripe for final disposition of these
lands: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the members of the First Reg-

ture, the House of Representatives and the
Senate concurring therein, that the Legisla-
ture supports scientific adaptive manage-

Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the
United States Congress to review the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) en-
vironmental assessment process for trans-
portation projects to ensure that stake-
holders are quickly and fully informed when-
ever wildlife crossing infrastructure is pro-
posed as an option for a transportation
project; to the Committee on Environment
and Public Works.
HOUSE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 6
Whereas, public highway agencies, includ-
ing the Idaho Transportation Department
(ITD) and Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) are required to conduct environ-
mental assessments to consider the environ-
mental effects of transportation projects re-
ceiving federal funds pursuant to the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) re-
view process; and
Whereas, environmental assessments con-
ducted pursuant to NEPA increasingly rec-
ommend that wildlife crossings, including
overpasses, underpasses, and related fencing,
are necessary or recommended additions to
transportation projects to allow for the safe
crossing of wildlife; and
Whereas, the link between receipt of fed-
eral funds for highway projects and the ac-
ceptance of environmental assessment rec-
ommendations can cause concern for state
highway agencies such as ITD when objec-
tions to aspects of highway projects, such as
wildlife crossings, are raised; and
Whereas, as to a proposed highway im-
provement project for the reconstruction of
Targhee Pass on U.S. 20 between the junc-
tion with state highway 87 and the Montana
state line, the NEPA environmental assess-
ment process resulted in five alternative op-
tions, one of which would have included sev-
eral wildlife crossings and dozens of miles of
related fencing; and
Whereas, local citizens and elected offi-
cials, multiple homeowner associations, and
members of the Idaho Legislature became
concerned about the potential repercussions
of wildlife crossing bridges and fences in Fre-
mont County; and
Whereas, on an advisory ballot question
presented during the November 2018 general
election, 78% of Fremont County residents
participating voted against the option to in-
stall wildlife crossings and fences along U.S.
20; and
Whereas, in a testament to our democracy
in action and the power of citizens and gov-
ernmental entities to coordinate to create a
positive solution, ITD, ITD District 6, and
the FHWA recently recommended a preferred
alternative that addresses highway needs,
safety, and wildlife, but does not include
crossing structures with wildlife fencing; and
Whereas, the House of Representatives of
the Idaho Legislature is grateful for the hard
work and dedication shown by ITD and its
staff, including the staff of ITD District 6, as
well as the FHWA, to recommend a solution
that is responsive to the needs and concerns
of local Idaho citizens and highway users
while also achieving project objectives; and
Whereas, the House of Representatives of
the Idaho Legislature extends congratula-
tions to ITD, ITD District 6, and the FHWA
with respect to their recommendation of the
preferred alternative for the reconstruction
of the Targhee Pass; and
Whereas, the House of Representatives of
the Idaho Legislature believes that the situ-
ation presented by the Targhee Pass project
and an initial option including wildlife
bridges and fencing may again arise as to fu-
ture transportation projects in Idaho; and
Whereas, a wide range of stakeholders are
affected by wildlife crossings and related in-
frastructure in ways that are distinct from
other transportation-related proposals and
actions; and
Whereas, areas adjacent to highways in the
State of Idaho are critical not only for the
safe passage of motor vehicles, cyclists, and
pedestrians but also for access to private and
public lands, livestock, recreation, hunting,
snow removal, and the preservation of scenic
views; and
Whereas, stakeholders may not initially
realize that transportation-related projects
could ultimately involve the consideration
of wildlife crossing infrastructure, including
fencing, presenting a potential challenge to
the goal of stakeholder involvement; and
Whereas, as demonstrated by the outcome
of the Targhee Pass project recommenda-
tion, government functions most effectively
when the voices of the people are heard and
agencies are able to cooperate effectively to-
gether; and
Whereas, affected stakeholders benefit
from the opportunity to be informed as soon
as possible about the extent and potential
impact of projects to allow for involvement
in decisions about animal crossings and re-
lated infrastructure: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the members of the First Reg-
ular Session of the Sixty-fifth Idaho Legisla-
ture, the House of Representatives and the
Senate concurring therein, that we urge the
members of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives in the Congress of the United
States to review the NEPA environmental
assessment process for transportation
projects to ensure that stakeholders are
quickly and fully informed whenever wildlife
crossing infrastructure is proposed as an op-
tion for a transportation project and that
state transportation agencies be given clear
guidance to that effect; and be it further

resources to New Jersey and other states in
which large populations of seniors and recent
immigrants have been the target of a recent
surge in tax-related scams; to the Com-
mittee on Finance.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 40
Whereas, The federal Internal Revenue
Service has reported a recent surge in tax-re-
lated scams that seek to defraud
unsuspecting taxpayers; and
Whereas, These tax-related scams typi-
cally involve criminal conspirators and
other scammers who make or send unsolic-
ited phone calls, text messages, or emails
claiming to be agents working on behalf of
the federal Internal Revenue Service; and
Whereas, The scammers impersonating fed-
eral agents demand that the victim pay a
bogus tax bill to settle an unpaid tax liabil-
ity, and often con the victim into making
payment on the bogus bill by using threats
of arrest, deportation, license revocation, or
the seizure of valuable assets, and
Whereas, In a recent report to the United
States Congress, the federal Treasury Inspec-
tor General for Tax Administration indi-
cated that between October 2013 and March
2016, the inspector general received more
than one million contacts from taxpayers
nationally who reported that they had re-
ceived telephone calls from individuals who
claimed to be employees of the federal Inter-
nal Revenue Service; and
Whereas, The inspector general’s report to
Congress also indicated that during that
same period of time more than 5,700 victims
nationally reported that they had paid im-
personators a total of $31 million, and in New
Jersey alone more than 300 victims reported
paying a total of $1 47 million stemming
from these tax-related scams; and
Whereas, To combat the recent surge and
protect taxpayers from becoming victims in
the future, the inspector general has estab-
lished an ‘‘advise and disrupt’’ approach to
the scams that advises the scammers that
their activity is fraudulent and criminal and
shuts down the modes of communication
that are used to perpetuate the scams; and
Whereas, The inspector general has also
sought to combat the surge by using tradi-
tional media to inform taxpayers about the
dangers posed by the scams and by working
with partners in the public and private sec-
tors to remind taxpayers to remain on ‘‘high
alert’’ during tax filing season when at-
tempts by impersonators to contact tax-
payers are at their peak, and
Whereas, Despite these efforts, additional

other similar fraudulent schemes due to
their perceived vulnerability and fear of re-
porting the abuses to the appropriate au-
thorities; and
Whereas, The additional federal resources
could be used to more fully understand the
extent of the problem, to better identify the
individuals and criminal organizations re-
sponsible for perpetuating the scams, and to
develop more viable methods for informing
New Jersey’s seniors and immigrant commu-
nities about the dangers posed by the scams
and how to report suspected threats: Now
therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate of the State of New
Jersey: 1. The federal Internal Revenue Serv-
ice is urged to devote additional resources to
New Jersey and other states in which large
populations of seniors and recent immi-
grants have been the preferred target of a re-
cent surge in tax-related scams perpetrated
by criminal conspirators and other
scammers who make or send unsolicited
phone calls, text messages, or emails claim-
ing to be agents working on behalf of the fed-
eral Internal Revenue Service in an effort to
con victims into making payment on bogus
tax bills.
2. The additional resources could be used
to more fully understand the extent of the
problem, to better identify the individuals
and criminal organizations responsible for
perpetuating the scams, and to develop more
viable methods for informing New Jersey’s
seniors and recent immigrants about the
dangers posed by the scams and how to re-
port suspected threats.

means necessary to fully secure the Texas-
Mexico international border; to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 535
Whereas, The United States Congress has
the moral and constitutional responsibility
to fully maintain the operational security of
the Texas-Mexico international border; and
Whereas, The United States Congress has
neglected to fully fund the maintenance,
order, and safety of the Texas-Mexico inter-
national border; and
Whereas, An unprotected border facilitates
drug smuggling and human trafficking and
opens the door to spillover violence from
criminal cartels and poses a grave threat to
homeland security; and
Whereas, On March 28, 2019, the U.S. De-
partment of Homeland Security (DHS) Sec-
retary, Kirstjen Nielsen, sent an urgent re-
quest to the United States Congress describ-
ing the border as ‘‘a humanitarian and secu-
rity catastrophe that is worsening by the
day’’; and
Whereas, DHS is expected to report the
interdiction of 100,000 migrants in March
2019, which would be the highest monthly
total in a decade; and
Whereas, U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion (CBP) had 12,000 migrants in custody
the last week of March 2019, an unprece-
dented number; and
Whereas, Secretary Nielsen reports that
the volume of ‘‘vulnerable populations’’ is
unsustainable and DHS, CBP, and Health and
Human Services (HHS) facilities are at peak
capacity to shelter unaccompanied alien
children (UAC); and
Whereas, Due to the unprecedented influx
of migrants overwhelming the capacity at
CBP stations and the ongoing crisis, U.S.
Border Patrol agents assigned to the Del Rio
Sector have begun releasing detainees into
Texas; and
Whereas, News reports reveal undocu-
mented women have made their way into
American border towns after being beaten
for disobeying smugglers, impregnated by
strangers, coerced into prostitution, shack-
led to beds and trees, and—in at least a
handful of cases—bound with duct tape, rope,
or handcuffs; and
Whereas, 194,000 criminal aliens booked
into Texas jails from 2011–2019 were charged
with more than 299,000 criminal offenses; and
Whereas, CBP reports the unprecedented
increase in migrant interdictions is having a
detrimental impact on CBP’s primary border
security mission and security posture result-
ing in up to 40 percent or more of CBP per-
sonnel working to care for, transport, and
process vulnerable families and children; and
Whereas, Transnational criminal organiza-
tions and smugglers are using large groups of
families as diversions to exploit and profit
from reduced border enforcement presence;
and
Whereas, Members of Congress have filed
legislation to designate drug cartels as For-
eign Terrorist Organizations for their under-
mining of American national security with a
relentless attack on our border while traf-
ficking in human beings; and
Whereas, The President of the United
States has declared the situation along the
border a ‘‘crisis’’; and
Whereas, The United States Congress has
consistently delayed meaningful action on
border security, forcing Texas to expend sig-
nificant resources to keep the international
border with Mexico secure and placing an
undue burden on the state’s taxpayers: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Texas Senate hereby ex-
presses its dissatisfaction with the United
States Congress’ inadequate efforts to fully
fund the operational security of the Texas-
Mexico international border; and, be it fur-
ther
Resolved, That the Texas Senate calls upon
the United States Congress to adopt a budget
that fully funds all means necessary to fully
secure the Texas-Mexico international bor-
der, including, but not limited to, deploying
personnel, implementing effective tech-
nologies, and erecting barriers where needed;
and, be it further
Resolved, That the Texas Senate requests
the federal government cease separating
families at the border as a means of deter-
ring refugees, and to humanely process ref-
ugee and asylum seekers; and, be it further
Resolved, That the Texas Senate declares
this crisis at the Texas-Mexico International
Border an emergency; and, be it further
Resolved, The Texas Senate supports the
President in his efforts to move forward with
emergency action; and, be it further
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Texas
Senate forward official copies of this resolu-

Whereas, Bardstown has been recognized as
the ‘‘Bourbon Capital of the World’’; and
Whereas, one-third of the world’s bourbon

families and returning these individuals to
places where they do not know the language,
culture, or have any known family members;
and
Whereas, the individuals who do not have
citizenship were adopted from various coun-
tries including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Germany, Guatemala, El Sal-
vador, India, Ireland, Haiti, Iran, Japan,
Mexico, Panama, Philippines, Russia,

Whereas, two bills which would have grant-

introduced with bipartisan support in the
115th Congress: the Adoptee Citizenship Act
of 2018 (S. 2522) and the Adoptee Citizenship
Act of 2018 (H.R. 5233). Neither bill was re-
ferred out of committee for a Congressional
vote; and
Whereas, both bills sought to amend the
Immigration and Nationality Act to grant
automatic citizenship to all qualifying chil-
dren adopted by a U.S. citizen parent, re-
gardless of the date on which the adoption
was finalized or the entrance visa; and
Whereas, citizenship would be granted to
any individual who was adopted by a U.S.
citizen before age 18, was physically present
in the United States in the citizen parent’s
legal custody pursuant to lawful admission
before the individual reached age 18, never
previously acquired U.S. citizenship, and was
lawfully residing in the United States; and
Whereas, major cities such as Seattle, Los
Angeles, Houston, and Philadelphia have al-
ready passed resolutions in support of
adoptee citizenship, as well as the state of
California; and
Whereas, citizenship is a civil right of all
children adopted by a U.S. citizen parent;
and
Whereas, children adopted by U.S. citizen
parents should have the same rights as chil-
dren of U.S. citizens; and
Whereas, this civil right should be pro-
tected by legislation that provides auto-
matic citizenship for all adult adoptees
whose adoptive parents did not complete the
naturalization process while they were chil-
dren: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives of

POM–44. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of New Jersey condemning
hate crimes and any other form of racism,
religious or ethnic bias, discrimination, in-
citement to violence or animus targeting of
minorities in New Jersey; to the Committee
on the Judiciary.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 118
Whereas, In the past several years, violent
crimes, threats of violence, and other inci-
dents of hate-motivated targeting of reli-
gious, racial, and ethnic minorities have in-
creased across the State of New Jersey and
the United States; and
Whereas, The Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) defines a hate crime as a ‘‘crimi-
nal offense against a person or property mo-
tivated in whole or in part by an offender’s
bias against a race, religion, disability, sex-
ual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender
identity’’; and
Whereas, According to FBI statistics, the
number of reported hate crime incidents na-
tionally in 2017 had increased 17 percent over
2016 totals, representing the first consecutive
three-year annual increase and the largest
single-year increase since 2001, when hate
crimes targeting Muslim Americans in-
creased in the aftermath of the September
11, 2001 ø,¿ attacks; and
Whereas, According to the FBI, in 2017, 495
hate crimes were reported in New Jersey, a
76 percent increase from the previous year
and the fourth-highest total in the nation,
and of those hate crimes 260 incidents were
attributed to race or ethnic bias, 180 inci-
dents were attributed to religious bias, 51 in-
cidents were attributed to sexual orienta-
tion, and four incidents were attributed to
disability; and
Whereas, In 2017, anti-Semitic incidents in-
creased 57 percent in the United States com-
pared to 2016, and 32 percent in New Jersey
with 208 reported incidents, according to the
Anti-Defamation League’s 2017 Audit of
Anti-Semitic incidents, which describes
trends such as the tripling of assaults tar-
geting Jews since 2012 and the rise of online
harassment and hate speech directed at Jew-
ish journalists and individuals through so-
cial media; and
Whereas, On October 27, 2018, 11 people
were killed and seven wounded in an armed
attack at a synagogue, Tree of Life—Or
L’Simcha Congregation, in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania; and
Whereas, In 2015, among single-bias hate
crime incidents in the United States, 59.2
percent of victims were targeted due to ra-
cial, ethnic, or ancestry bias, and among
those victims, 52.2 percent were victims of
crimes motivated by the offenders’ anti-
Black or anti-African-American bias, accord-
ing to the FBI; and
Whereas, In 2015, the U.S. Transgender Sur-
vey results found that 16 percent of
transgender students in kindergarten
through grade 12 in New Jersey faced such
severe mistreatment as øa¿ transgender
øperson¿ persons that they left the school
and, further, 26 percent of respondents in
New Jersey who were out or perceived as
transgender in college or vocational school
were verbally, physically, or sexually har-
assed because of being transgender; and
Whereas, On June 12, 2016, 49 people were
killed and 58 others wounded in an armed at-
tack on Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando,
Florida, and
Whereas, In 2017, the National Coalition of
Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) reported a
26 percent increase in reported lesbian-gay-
bisexual-transgender-queer (LGBTQ) homi-
cides nationally in 2016, and of the homicides
reported in 2017, 75 percent were LGBTQ peo-
ple of color; and
Whereas, In 2018, there has been harass-
ment and hate-based violence against indi-
viduals who are perceived to be Muslim, in-
cluding members of South Asian commu-
nities in the United States, and Hindu and
Sikh-Americans have been the target of
hate-based violence targeting religious mi-
norities; and
Whereas, The Bias Crime Unit, in the New
Jersey Division of Criminal Justice in the
Department of Law and Public Safety, is the
østatewide¿ Statewide coordinator of efforts
to eliminate crimes motivated by prejudice
against others based on race, color, religion,
sexual orientation, gender, disability, or eth-
nicity and investigates complaints; and
Whereas, It is further in the public interest
of the citizens of the State of New Jersey
and this great nation to condemn, in the
strongest terms, any hate crimes or any
other form of conduct that constitutes rac-
ism, religious or ethnic bias, discrimination
based on disability, age, marriage, familial
status, or sexuality or gender discrimination
including incitement to violence. Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate of the State of New
Jersey:
1. This House strongly condemns hate
crimes and any other form of racism, reli-
gious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incite-
ment to violence, or animus targeting øof¿
minorities in New Jersey.
2. The Governor and the Attorney General
are encouraged to provide State assistance
to victims of hate crimes and to enhance se-
curity measures and improve preparedness at
religious institutions, places of worship, and
other institutions that have been targeted
because of their affiliation with any par-
ticular race, religion, disability, sexual ori-
entation, ethnicity, gender, or gender iden-
tity.
3. Copies of this resolution, as filed with
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted
by the Secretary of the Senate to the Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United States
of America, the presiding officers of the
United States Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, and each member of Congress
elected from State of New Jersey.

States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 1004
Whereas, the Legislature of the State of
South Dakota, in 1907, adopted House Joint
Resolution 2; in 1909, adopted House Joint
Resolutions 5 and 7; and in 1971, adopted
House Joint Resolution 503, making formal

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2611
May 2, 2019
Whereas, many veterans have been injured
or disabled in ways that affect their ability
to have children; and
Whereas, in vitro fertilization (IVF) was
previously a covered benefit for veterans
with a service-connected disability resulting
in the inability to procreate without the use
of fertility treatment, pursuant to 38 CFR
17.380; and
Whereas, IVF was also a covered benefit
for the spouse of a veteran with a service-
connected disability resulting in the inabil-
ity to procreate, pursuant to 38 CFR 17.412;
and
Whereas, the IVF benefit for veterans and
their spouses expired on September 30, 2018;
and
Whereas, IVF is the most successful fer-
tility treatment in use today; and
Whereas, intrauterine insemination (IUI),
another successful form of fertility treat-
ment, is not currently a covered benefit for
veterans or their spouses; and
Whereas, both IVF and IUI may help dis-
abled veterans and their spouses procreate
when the veteran’s service-related disability
would otherwise prevent them; and
Whereas, it is the strong belief of your
Memorialists that family life is of the ut-
most importance; and
Whereas, it is likewise the strong belief of
your Memorialists that those who serve our
nation in the armed forces should not lose
their ability to have children when it is
within our nation’s capacity to assist them:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, by the members of the First Reg-
ular Session of the Sixty-fifth Idaho Legisla-
ture, the House of Representatives and the
Senate concurring therein, that we request
that Congress enact legislation establishing
IVF and IUI as covered benefits for veterans
with a service-connected disability resulting
in an inability to procreate without the use
of fertility treatment; and be it further
Resolved, that we request that Congress
provide that IVF and IUI shall be made
available to the spouses of such veterans;
and be it further
Resolved, that the Chief Clerk of the House
of Representatives be, and she is hereby au-
thorized and directed to forward a copy of
this Memorial to the President of the Senate
and the Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives of Congress, and to the congressional
delegation representing the State of Idaho in
the Congress of the United States.

f
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. CORNYN:
S. 1303. A bill to amend the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act to address the
protective custody of alien children ac-
companied by parents, and for other
purposes; to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, during
the last break in our schedule here in
Congress in Washington, I spent 2
weeks traveling across my State—as
all of us, no doubt, did—and listening
and talking to my constituents about
what is on their minds, what they
think we ought to be doing, and what
our priorities should be.
In one city, I spoke with students and
teachers about the need to improve col-
lege and career readiness for histori-
cally underrepresented populations and
how a piece of legislation that we have
introduced with colleagues called the
GEAR UP for Success Act would better
serve those students.
It was a little bit of a revelation for
me, having come from a family where
my parents expected me to go to col-
lege, and they themselves went to col-
lege, that if other children are growing
up and don’t have that experience—
many times, their parents are not pre-
pared to help counsel them on which
courses they ought to begin to take as
early as seventh grade in order to be
prepared with the prerequisites to ad-
vance up the educational ladder and be
ready for college, to get into the col-
lege of their choice. So that was an im-
portant piece of legislation. Certainly,
working together with colleagues here,
I hope we can reauthorize and fund
those grants so that more of our young
people can get the advantage that
comes from that sort of counseling and
tutoring and help.
I also spent a little time at Dyess Air
Force Base in Abilene, TX, to talk
about military readiness and the im-
portance of the new strategic bomber—
the B–21—mission that is coming to
Texas and to the U.S. Air Force.
I also had a chance to talk to some of
my educators and other advocates
about the Jenna Quinn Law, which is
designed to help give caregivers and
teachers training so that they can ac-
tually recognize and report signs of
child sexual abuse in the children for
whom they are responsible.
It has been interesting to me because
it actually follows on legislation that
passed and has been successful in Texas
to train teachers and caregivers on the
signs of child sexual abuse so that they
can help get those children the help
they need, sometimes by asking ques-
tions they would never ask if they had
not been trained to recognize those
signs.
Jenna Quinn herself was an exam-
ple—this bill is named for her—of
somebody who was asked by her sister:
Jenna, has somebody hurt you? And
that opened up the story and, fortu-
nately, a prosecution and began the
path to healing from that trauma.
It is great to be able to talk about a
number of topics as we all return
home, and you can imagine, coming
from Texas, with 1,200 miles of common
border with Mexico, one of the things
we talked about is the humanitarian
crisis along the southwestern border.
Border Patrol agents in the Rio
Grande Valley Sector encountered sev-
eral large groups of people trying to
enter the United States last week. This
is just in 1 week. On Thursday, agents
near La Joya responded to a report of
a large group of migrants and found
more than 220 people in that one group,
mostly families and unaccompanied
children from Central America. The
very next day, they came across two
additional large groups, one with 145
people and another with nearly 300. On
Sunday, they apprehended a group of
170. That brings the total to more than
800 people from just 4 groups in 1 week.
These numbers represent a surge in
the volume of people we see coming
across the border historically. In fact,
now almost all of them come from
someplace other than Mexico. There is
actually no new net migration from
Mexico. But we see people being re-
cruited and paying for the services of
human smugglers to come from Central
America and actually many other
countries around the world where peo-
ple realize that if they can get access
to Central America and they can pay
the fees to the human smugglers, they
can make their way into the United
States.
That is why even President Obama
said in 2014 that this is a humanitarian
and security crisis. In fact, the state-
ment that President Obama made in
June of 2014 when he said that came on
the heels of 2 months of record-high ap-
prehensions of unaccompanied chil-
dren. Between May and June of 2014,
more than 135,000 people were appre-
hended at the southern border. Those
numbers were absolutely mind-bog-
gling to us at the time, but those fig-
ures pale in comparison to the level of
apprehensions we are seeing today.
In February and March of this year—
again, a 2-month period—more than
180,000 people were apprehended at the
southwestern border. So in 2014 when
President Obama called it a humani-
tarian and security crisis, it was
135,000. Today, in February and March,
it was 180,000. That is more than a 33-
percent increase from the humani-
tarian crisis President Obama referred
to in 2014. So if it was a crisis then, it
has now turned into a full system fail-
ure, and all lights are blinking red.
Detention centers are at over capac-
ity. The already understaffed Border
Patrol is struggling to meet their
needs. Officers and agents are pulling
double duty, as law enforcement offi-
cials have become caregivers for chil-
dren. Customs agents are being pulled
off their duty to process migrants.
NGOs—the nongovernmental organiza-
tions—and community organizations
that usually help the migrants process
the system are unable to keep pace.
Cities and counties across the border
are bearing the brunt of this massive
wave of humanity.
But if you think the situation is bad
now, and it is, it will only continue to
get worse because we typically see
higher apprehension rates in April and
May than we do in February and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2617
May 2, 2019
March. These rapidly depleting re-
sources are being overwhelmed, as I
said, and cannot keep pace.
We need to address the root of the
problem, and we need to do it soon.
Only Congress can pass the legislation
that is needed in order to come to grips
with this crisis. It is time for us to pass
legislation that will provide our front-
line officers and agents with the re-
sources they need in terms of staffing,
authorities, and infrastructure.
It is also important for us to plug
some of the holes that are being ex-
ploited by the human smugglers and
others that allow them to successfully
place migrants into the United States
97 percent of the time as long as they
are an unaccompanied minor or come
with a family.
Fortunately, I found a partner and
ally from the House body who happens
to be a Democrat by the name of
HENRY CUELLAR, who is willing to work
with me on this issue. He has been my
ally on a number of efforts to bring
commonsense reform, when it comes to
border security or trade, to Texas. We
don’t always agree, but we can agree
on a number of things, and those are
the things on which we like to work to-
gether.
Earlier today, HENRY CUELLAR and I
introduced the HUMANE Act, which
will make important and long-overdue
reforms to our immigration system,
and it includes commonsense provi-
sions that Republicans and Democrats
can and should agree on.
First, it closes a major loophole that
is often exploited by the human smug-
glers when they bring families into the
United States across the border ille-
gally. This is called generically the
Flores Settlement Agreement. That
name comes from a 1997 agreement
that determined that the Department
of Homeland Security can only detain
unaccompanied children for 20 days be-
fore releasing them to the Department
of Health and Human Services.
While this was unquestionably well-
intentioned at the beginning, it has
morphed into a much bigger problem
because in 2016, the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals expanded the Flores
holding, effectively applying the settle-
ment not just to unaccompanied chil-
dren but also to families and turning it
into a pull factor for illegal immi-
grants hoping to game the system.
I am grateful for the support of my
friend and ally Congressman CUELLAR
because we recognize that rather than
single adults arriving at the border
alone, many people are now bringing
children with them so they can pose as
a family. They realize they can bring a
child—anybody’s child—and pose as a
family unit so they can be released
after 20 days. Children are literally
being kidnapped to serve as a free tick-
et into the United States. Sadly, many
are abused along the way, and many
arrive at our border in very ill health.
We simply cannot stand by and do
nothing and let this continue to occur.
I know today I read in one of our
newspapers that the San Antonio
Chamber of Commerce said that be-
cause Customs agents are being rede-
ployed to deal with children and fami-
lies, handing out juice boxes and dia-
pers, that there has been a huge slow-
down in cross-border commerce and
trade. Because of the unique nature of
the supply chains that apply to manu-
facturing both in Mexico and the
United States, they estimate that as
much as $800 million a day is being lost
because now our infrastructure and our
staffing at our borders are being over-
whelmed.
So the HUMANE Act would clarify
that the Flores Settlement Agreement
only applies to unaccompanied chil-
dren and not to families, and it would
provide greater time for processing and
immigration proceedings to take place
before the families are released from
custody.
Secondly, this legislation would re-
quire that all unaccompanied children
are processed the same, regardless of
the country of their origin, because
under current law, children from Mex-
ico and Canada can be promptly re-
turned home if they don’t have a legiti-
mate claim, but processes for other
countries move much more slowly, if at
all. Put simply, we should make every
effort to safely return these children to
their home countries as quickly as pos-
sible if they don’t qualify for an immi-
gration benefit, just as we do now for
those from Mexico and Canada.
It would also require all children to
undergo biometric and DNA screening
to establish family relationships and
ensure that they are, in fact, traveling
with relatives rather than human
smugglers.
To better protect children who are
released to Health and Human Serv-
ices, this bill would place prohibitions
on certain individuals who could be
serving as guardians. For example, no
child should be released to the custody
of a sex offender or a human trafficker.
Third, the HUMANE Act would en-
able family units to stay together—
something, I would think, that all of us
should agree on—and streamline the
process for those in custody.
Consistent with the recommenda-
tions from the bipartisan DHS Home-
land Security Advisory Council, the
bill would require DHS to establish at
least four regional processing centers
along the southern border to house and
process families. This would literally
serve as a one-stop shop, with DHS per-
sonnel from Customs and Border Pro-
tection, ICE, USCIS, and FEMA assist-
ing migrants and working to process
their claims.
Under this legislation, asylum offi-
cers and immigration judges would be
forward-deployed to adjudicate claims
and expedite the entire process, which
we hope would begin to ease the burden
on our current debilitating immigra-
tion court backlog.
In addition to those changes, the leg-
islation also includes provisions to
make commonsense improvements,
like additional Customs and Border Pa-
trol personnel, and training for our
CBP and ICE employees who work with
children.
While we know this will not fix all of
the problems that exist in our immi-
gration system, we believe it is an im-
portant start to change the calculation
when it comes to people who say: I
know I don’t qualify for asylum, but I
am going to try anyway, and I am
going to pay a human smuggler $5,000,
$6,000, $7,000, or $8,000 to try to get me
from my home in Central America into
the United States because right now, 97
percent of the time, it works.
This is also a huge bonanza to these
cartels that are commodity agnostic.
They trade in drugs. They traffic chil-
dren, women, and, yes, they move mi-
grants across the border for money.
This will put a big dent in their profits,
as we should want to do.
It will also send a message to those
who do not have valid claims: Don’t
even try.
So it will have a deterrent value,
which I think will begin to help us con-
trol the huge surge of humanity com-
ing across now, which were, as I said,
76,000 in February and 103,000 in March.
We are going to see those numbers con-
tinue to go up and up and up, further
overwhelming our capacity to deal
with this humanitarian crisis unless we
do something, like this legislation that
Congressman CUELLAR and I have in-
troduced.
I am grateful for the support and co-
operation of my friend and colleague
from the House. I am sure there are
people in his party who will say he has
done too much, just as there are people
in my party who will say we haven’t
done enough. But around here, you
have to start somewhere, and where
you start is where you can find com-
mon cause and agreement and begin to
build consensus to solve problems.
Hopefully, if we are successful in
passing this legislation, this will not
only address this humanitarian crisis,
but it will maybe establish a downpay-
ment of goodwill and demonstrate our
ability to solve some of our other prob-
lems here in the Congress, particularly
those that relate to our broken immi-
gration system.
I hope we will soon have the oppor-
tunity to consider this text in the Ju-
diciary Committee—I talked to Chair-
man GRAHAM, who seemed willing to do
that—and bring more members into the
debate so we can provide relief for
those struggling to manage the crisis.

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself,
Ms. HARRIS, Mr. WYDEN, Mr.
MERKLEY, Ms. CANTWELL, Mrs.
MURRAY, Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr.
BOOKER, Mr. SANDERS, Mr.
WHITEHOUSE, Mr. MARKEY, Mrs.
GILLIBRAND, and Mr. PETERS):
S. 1318. A bill to amend the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act to perma-
nently prohibit the conduct of offshore
drilling on the outer Continental Shelf
off the coast of California, Oregon, and
Washington; to the Committee on En-
ergy and Natural Resources.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise today to reintroduce the ‘‘West
Coast Ocean Protection Act.’’
This bill would amend the Outer Con-
tinental Shelf Lands Act to perma-
nently block new leases for offshore oil
or gas in federal waters off the coast of
California, Oregon or Washington.
I’m pleased to be joined today by
Senators HARRIS, WYDEN, MERKLEY,
CANTWELL, MURRAY, MENENDEZ, BOOK-
ER, SANDERS, WHITEHOUSE, MARKEY,
GILLIBRAND, PETERS in sponsoring this
bill, which has been introduced in
every Congress since the Deepwater
Horizon disaster in April 2010.
11 people were killed and 17 others in-
jured when the Deepwater Horizon well
blew out. Oil and gas spewed into the
Gulf of Mexico for 87 days.
Oil slicks covered the Gulf. Tar balls
and toxic sludge covered beaches and
wetlands. More than one-third of Fed-
eral waters in the Gulf were closed to
fishing.
The impacts of the Deepwater Hori-
zon disaster continue to affect birds
and marine life, and marine biologists
are still learning about the long-term
effects, demonstrating the risks of off-
shore oil and gas extraction. Califor-
nians know all too well the dangers
posed by offshore drilling. Before Deep-
water Horizon and Exxon Valdez, there
was the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara.
A well blowout on an offshore rig
spilled more than 3 million gallons of
crude oil according to some esti-
mates—the worst spill in U.S. history
at the time.
The spill closed local beaches—which
were covered by a thick layer of oil—
and thousands of marine mammals and
birds were killed. Tourists were turned
away and commercial fishing oper-
ations were halted, hurting the local
economy.
After the Santa Barbara spill, Cali-
fornia had enough. The State blocked
all new offshore drilling in state
waters—which extend three miles from
the shore—and in 1994 enacted a perma-
nent offshore drilling ban.
Through local ordinances, congres-
sional opposition, and presidential
moratoria, all new drilling in federal
waters off California has been blocked
since 1984. Today, opposition to off-
shore drilling is higher than ever. Re-
cent polling has found that nearly 70
percent of Californians oppose new
drilling off our coast.
Yet, on January 8, 2018, the Trump
administration proposed to allow drill-
ing in nearly all Federal waters, in-
cluding in all three regions off the
California coast. The leases are pro-
posed to begin in 2020 and would lead to
the first new drilling operations in
these areas in more than 35 years.
Sixty-eight cities and counties rep-
resenting a majority of California’s
population have voiced their strong op-
position to President Trump’s mis-
guided plan.
In an addition, California’s Governor,
Senate, Assembly, Attorney General,
Coastal Commission, Fish and Game
Commission, and State Lands Commis-
sion have shared their opposition to
the administration’s drilling plan. For-
tunately, the Administration has al-
ready suggested that its plans for off-
shore drilling have been delayed as
they determine how to respond to legal
setbacks. The plans are flawed, and
should be withdrawn altogether.
Those of us on the Pacific Coast do
not want any further offshore oil and
gas development.
It is long past time to respect the
substantial local opposition by passing
the ‘‘West Coast Ocean Protection
Act’’ to permanently ban offshore drill-
ing and protect our coast for genera-
tions to come. I yield the floor.

free and open Indo-Pacific region, and con-
tributes internationally to peace and sta-
bility;
Whereas the United States and Japan are
indispensable partners in combating the pro-
liferation of weapons of mass destruction,
improving global health, countering human
trafficking and promoting human rights, as-
sisting the victims of conflict and disaster
worldwide, and contributing to global eco-

Whereas the alliance is a testament to the
ability of great nations to overcome the past

Whereas our two countries, coming from
different cultural backgrounds, have created
an active and dynamic relationship bene-

Whereas, on April 21, 2019, Sri Lanka suf-
fered a horrific series of coordinated ter-
rorist attacks that killed more than 250 peo-
ple and injured more than 500 additional peo-
ple;
Whereas the attacks targeted Christian
churches, in which innocent men, women,
and children were celebrating Easter Sun-
day;
Whereas the attacks targeted several loca-
tions frequented by foreign tourists, result-
ing in the deaths of over 40 people from na-
tions other than Sri Lanka, including four
American citizens: Dieter Kowalski, Amelie
Linsey, Daniel Linsey, and Kieran Shafritz
de Zoysa;
Whereas Sri Lanka has determined that a
local Islamist militant group perpetrated
this horrifying attack and is responsible for
the resulting loss of life, injury, and destruc-
tion;
Whereas the use of nine suicide bombers in
multiple locations demonstrates a high de-
gree of coordination and planning;
Whereas growing evidence links the Is-
lamic State to these attacks, demonstrating
this terrorist organization’s continued reach
and capability to inflict terror, violence, and
brutality around the world, despite its loss
of physical territory;
Whereas religious freedom is a
foundational and universal right of all peo-
ple, and religious freedom and tolerance are
important to the flourishing of multi-reli-
gious societies like Sri Lanka;
Whereas Sri Lanka has worked towards a
lasting peace, ethnic and religious harmony,
and prosperity for all;
Whereas the rights of all religious minori-
ties must be protected, including the rights
of Christians, who, among other religious
communities, have faced increased violence
in recent years from terrorist groups around
the world;
Whereas the United States values its part-
nership with Sri Lanka and seeks to build on
that partnership by pursuing shared goals in
the Indo-Pacific region;
Whereas the United States is home to a
large Sri Lankan diaspora, who make signifi-
cant contributions to American society; and
Whereas American law enforcement offi-
cials and military personnel are supporting
the Sri Lankan Government’s investigation
of this attack: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) condemns, in the strongest terms, the
terrorist attacks perpetrated by violent
Islamist extremists against innocent civil-
ians on Easter Sunday;
(2) condemns the use violence against peo-
ple of religious faith, including in their
places of worship;
(3) offers its sincere and heartfelt condo-
lences to the victims, their families and
friends, and to the nation of Sri Lanka;
(4) reaffirms its solidarity with the people
of Sri Lanka and its support for the United
States partnership with the nation of Sri
Lanka;
(5) notes, on this 10th anniversary of the
end of Sri Lanka’s civil war, the importance
of national unity and encourages the Gov-
ernment of Sri Lanka to foster such unity,
including religious and ethnic tolerance;
(6) supports efforts to ensure the protec-
tion of all Sri Lankans against retaliatory
attacks as the country recovers from this
tragedy;
(7) reaffirms its commitment to religious
freedom and the importance of protecting
the rights of all religious minorities, includ-
ing Christians;
(8) calls attention to the continued and se-
rious threat posed by the Islamic State and
other international terrorist organizations;
and

SENATE RESOLUTION 186—RECOG-
NIZING APRIL 30, 2019, AS ‘‘EL
DIA DE LOS NINOS–CELE-
BRATING YOUNG AMERICANS’’
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr.
CRAPO, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. CARPER,
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO, Ms. DUCKWORTH,
Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. GARDNER, Ms. HAR-
RIS, Mr. HEINRICH, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr.
REED, Ms. ROSEN, Ms. MCSALLY, Ms.
KLOBUCHAR, and Ms. SINEMA) submitted
the following resolution; which was
considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 186
Whereas, each year in the United States,
El Dı́a de los Niños–Celebrating Young
Americans is recognized as a day to affirm
and recognize the importance of young chil-
dren and adolescents in the United States;
Whereas children and adolescents rep-
resent the hopes and dreams of the people of
the United States, and the well-being of chil-
dren and adolescents is emphasized as a top
priority in the United States;
Whereas, according to data of the Bureau
of the Census, the Hispanic population in the
United States is the youngest major racial
or ethnic group in the United States, as—
(1) more than 18,100,000 Hispanics in the
United States, a group that represents near-
ly 1⁄3 of the Hispanic population in the
United States, are younger than 18 years of
age; and
(2) in 2017, more than 15,600,000 Hispanics in
the United States, a group that represents
more than 1⁄4 of the Hispanic population in
the United States, were individuals between
18 and 34 years of age (commonly referred to
as ‘‘millennials’’);
Whereas the Hispanic population in the
United States continues to grow and is a sig-
nificant part of the workforce in the United
States, and children in that population will
be consumers, taxpayers, and voters in the
future;
Whereas, as the United States becomes
more culturally and ethnically diverse, the
people of the United States must strive to
bring about cultural understanding and cele-
brate a tradition that honors all children
and adolescents on El Dı́a de los Niños-Cele-
brating Young Americans, a day that ac-
knowledges and shares traditions and cus-
toms with all people in the United States;
Whereas parents are at the center of teach-
ing children about family values, morality,
life preparation, health, survival, and cul-
ture;
Whereas the designation of a day of special
recognition to honor children and adoles-
cents in the United States—
(1) will help affirm the significance of fam-
ily, education, health, and community
among the people of the United States; and
(2) will provide an opportunity for those
children and adolescents to reflect on their
futures, to articulate their aspirations, to
find comfort and security in the support of
their family members, communities, and
schools, and to grow to contribute to the
United States;
Whereas the National Latino Children’s In-
stitute, which serves as an advocate and a
voice for young Latino children—
(1) will celebrate its 21st anniversary in
2019;
(2) has partnered with States and cities
throughout the United States since 1998; and
(3) will declare April 30, 2019, as ‘‘El Dı́a de
los Niños-Celebrating Young Americans’’, a
day to bring communities and Latinos to-
gether across the United States to celebrate
and uplift children; and
Whereas April 30, 2019, would be an appro-
priate day to recognize as ‘‘El Dı́a de los
Niños-Celebrating Young Americans’’: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes April 30, 2019, as ‘‘El Dı́a de
los Niños-Celebrating Young Americans’’;
(2) encourages the people of the United
States—
(A) to nurture and invest in children and
adolescents in order to preserve and enhance
economic prosperity, democracy, and the
free and open exchange of ideas, which are
concepts that are essential to the spirit of
the United States; and
(B) to celebrate the gifts of children and
adolescents and to help them take their
rightful place in the future of the United
States; and
(3) calls on the people of the United States
to join with children, families, communities,
schools, churches, cities, and States across
the United States to observe El Dı́a de los
Niños–Celebrating Young Americans with
appropriate ceremonies, including activities
that—
(A) center on children and are free or of
minimal cost so as to facilitate full partici-
pation by all people;
(B) uplift and help children positively envi-
sion a path to their futures by allowing chil-
dren to voice their hopes and dreams;
(C) offer opportunities for children of di-
verse backgrounds to learn about the cul-
tures of one another and to share ideas;
(D) include family members, especially ex-
tended and elderly family members, so as
to—
(i) promote understanding and communica-
tion among generations within families; and
(ii) enable young people to learn from, and
respect and benefit from the experiences of,
their family elders;
(E) enable diverse communities to build re-
lationships of understanding; and
(F) provide children with safe schools,
homes, and communities that give them the
long-term support they need to learn, de-
velop, and become confident young adults
who are ready and eager to believe in and
contribute to the United States.

SENATE RESOLUTION 187—RECOG-
NIZING THE CULTURAL AND HIS-
TORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
CINCO DE MAYO HOLIDAY
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr.
CORNYN, Mr. BENNET, Mr. BLUMENTHAL,
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO, Mr. GARDNER, Ms.
HARRIS, Mr. HEINRICH, Ms. KLOBUCHAR,
Ms. MCSALLY, Mrs. MURRAY, Ms.
ROSEN, Ms. SINEMA, and Ms. SMITH)
submitted the following resolution;
which was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 187
Whereas May 5, or ‘‘Cinco de Mayo’’ in
Spanish, is celebrated each year as a date of
importance by Mexican and Mexican-Amer-
ican communities;
Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday com-
memorates May 5, 1862, the date on which
Mexicans defeated the French at the Battle
of Puebla, one of the many battles that the
Mexican people won in their long and brave
fight for independence, freedom, and democ-
racy;
Whereas the victory of Mexico over France
at Puebla represented a historic triumph for
the Mexican government during the Franco-
Mexican war fought between 1861 and 1867
and bolstered the resistance movement;
Whereas the success of Mexico at the Bat-
tle of Puebla reinvigorated the spirits of the
Mexican people and provided a renewed sense
of unity and strength;
Whereas the French army, which had not
experienced defeat against any of the finest
troops of Europe in more than half a cen-
tury, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands
of an outnumbered and ill-equipped, but
highly spirited and courageous, Mexican
army;
Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexi-
can General Ignacio Zaragoza and his men
displayed during that historic battle can
never be forgotten;
Whereas, in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo
symbolizes the right of a free people to self-
determination, just as Benito Juarez, the
president of Mexico during the Battle of
Puebla, once said, ‘‘El respeto al derecho
ajeno es la paz’’, meaning ‘‘respect for the
rights of others is peace’’;
Whereas the sacrifice of Mexican fighters
was instrumental in keeping Mexico from
falling under European domination while, in
the United States, the Union Army battled
Confederate forces in the Civil War;
Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a re-
minder that the foundation of the United
States was built by people from many coun-
tries and diverse cultures who were willing
to fight and die for freedom;
Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a re-
minder of the close ties between the people
of Mexico and the people of the United
States;
Whereas Cinco de Mayo encourages the
celebration of a legacy of strong leaders and
a sense of vibrancy in communities; and

ture generations: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes the historic struggle of the
people of Mexico for independence and free-

and
(2) encourages the people of the United

SENATE RESOLUTION 188—ENCOUR-
AGING A SWIFT TRANSFER OF
POWER BY THE MILITARY TO A
CIVILIAN-LED POLITICAL AU-
THORITY IN THE REPUBLIC OF
THE SUDAN, AND FOR OTHER
PURPOSES
Mr. CRUZ (for himself, Mr. DURBIN,
Mr. RISCH, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr.
CRAMER, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. ISAK-
SON, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. BOOZMAN, Ms.
HARRIS, Mr. YOUNG, Mr. COONS, Mr.
ROBERTS, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. HAWLEY, Ms.
KLOBUCHAR, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. GRAHAM,
Mr. PETERS, and Ms. SMITH) submitted
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations:
S. RES. 188
Whereas the nation of Sudan has endured
corrupt and brutal dictatorships for most of
its post-independence period since 1956;
Whereas President Omar al-Bashir came to
power through a military coup in 1989, and
for the next three decades his government
was responsible for horrendous crimes in
Sudan, especially Darfur, South Kordofan,
Blue Nile, and in what is now the Republic of
South Sudan;
Whereas the United States Government
designated Sudan a State Sponsor of Ter-
rorism on August 12, 1993, for its support to
international terrorist organizations and ex-
tremists, including elements of what would
later be known as al Qaeda;
Whereas more than two decades of civil
war between President al-Bashir’s govern-
ment and insurgents in southern Sudan re-
sulted in more than 2,000,000 deaths and led
to the eventual independence of South Sudan
in 2011;
Whereas in 2003, President al-Bashir’s gov-
ernment launched a ruthless crackdown
against insurgents and civilians in Darfur
that killed at least 300,000 Sudanese and dis-
placed 2,500,000 more, resulting in Congress
and the Administration of President George
W. Bush in 2004 describing as genocide the
Government of Sudan’s actions in Darfur;
Whereas in 2011, when conflict resumed in
South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, Presi-
dent al-Bashir’s government conducted in-
discriminate bombings and raided villages,
raping and killing civilians, and waged a
campaign of forced starvation in the Nuba
Mountains region of South Kordofan that
displaced as many as 2,000,000 people;
Whereas, while the fighting between gov-
ernment forces and insurgents in Darfur has
subsided since 2016, when the government
waged a large-scale offensive before declar-
ing a ceasefire, violent attacks against civil-
ians continue and humanitarian access re-
mains restricted in some opposition strong-
hold areas of Darfur, South Kordofan, and
Blue Nile;
Whereas President al-Bashir remains the
subject of two outstanding arrest warrants
from the International Criminal Court based
on charges including five counts of crimes
against humanity, two counts of war crimes,
and three counts of genocide;
Whereas Sudan’s economic crisis risks
bringing the national economy to total col-
lapse, further raising the possibility of state
failure and broader regional destabilization
that could threaten a wide array of United
States interests in East and North Africa
and the Red Sea regions;
Whereas the people of Sudan have engaged
since December 2018 in a wave of peaceful
protests throughout the country demanding
an end to the hegemony of President al-
Bashir’s brutal regime;
Whereas President al-Bashir’s government
unlawfully detained and tortured hundreds
of Sudanese during the protests, including
political leaders, journalists, doctors, union-
ists, and youth and women leaders, in viola-
tion of the country’s constitutional provi-
sions guaranteeing free speech, association,
and assembly;
Whereas on February 22, 2019, President al-
Bashir declared a year-long nationwide state
of emergency and curfew, dissolving his gov-
ernment and replacing state governors with
senior security officers and expanding the
powers of Sudan’s security forces;
Whereas when protesters in early April
challenged President al-Bashir’s decrees and
gathered in the tens of thousands in front of
Sudan’s military headquarters in Khartoum
to call for an end to the regime, some ele-
ments of the security forces tried to disperse
the crowds with violence, leading to clashes
between internal security forces and the
military as some soldiers sought to protect
the protesters;
Whereas on April 11, 2019, after five days of
mass protests in front of their headquarters,
Sudan’s military removed President al-
Bashir from office and the country’s First
Vice President and Minister of Defense, Lt.
General Awad Ibn Auf, announced he would
lead a Transitional Military Committee
(‘‘TMC’’) that would rule the country for a
two-year transition period, in addition to the
suspension of the Constitution, dissolution
of the National Assembly, and the imposi-
tion of a three-month State of Emergency
and nightly curfew;
Whereas Lt. General Abdel-Fattah
Burnhan, former general inspector of the Su-
danese Armed Forces, who replaced Ibn Auf
on April 12, 2019, as the Chairman of the
Transitional Military Council, said on April
21, 2019, that the council was ‘‘ready to hand
over power tomorrow to a civilian govern-
ment agreed by political forces’’; and
Whereas, the African Union Peace and Se-
curity Council convened on April 30, 2019,
and reiterated its conviction that ‘‘a mili-
tary-led transition in Sudan will be totally
unacceptable and contrary to the will and le-
gitimate aspirations’’ of the Sudanese peo-
ple, expressed ‘‘deep regret’’ that the mili-
tary had not stepped aside, and, noting nego-
tiations were underway, demanded that the
military hand over power to a civilian-led
transitional authority within 60 days: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) encourages a swift transfer of power by
the military to a civilian-led political au-
thority in Sudan that—
(A) respects and reflects the legitimate
democratic aspirations of the people of
Sudan; and
(B) engages in a credible process of democ-
ratization, governance, and security sector
reforms, and is transparent in how it meas-
ures such progress;
(2) calls on the ruling authorities in Sudan
to take measurable steps to—
(A) respect the right to freedom of associa-
tion and expression;
(B) protect the rights of opposition polit-
ical parties, journalists, human rights de-
fenders, religious minorities, and nongovern-
mental organizations to operate without in-
terference;
(C) lift the bureaucratic restrictions on
and facilitate access for humanitarian relief
operations;
(D) introduce strong measures to create
transparency and address the structural cor-
ruption and kleptocracy of the state; and
(E) pursue accountability for serious
crimes and human rights abuses;
(3) expresses solidarity with the people of
Sudan, and urges the United States Govern-
ment to provide diplomatic, technical, and
targeted financial assistance for efforts to
advance a peaceful transfer of power and a
civilian-led transition period that allows for
the peaceful resolution of Sudan’s conflicts
and creates the conditions under which time-
ly democratic elections can be held that will
meet international standards and be over-
seen by credible domestic and international
electoral observers;
(4) encourages the African Union to con-
tinue supporting the Sudanese people’s aspi-
rations for democracy, justice, and peace;
and
(5) emphasizes that until a transition to a
credible civilian-led government that re-
flects the aspirations of the Sudanese people
is established, the process to consider remov-
ing Sudan from the State Sponsor of Ter-
rorism List, lifting any other remaining
sanctions on Sudan, or normalizing relations
with the Government of Sudan will continue
to be suspended.

S. RES. 189
Whereas antisemitism is a unique form of
prejudice stretching back millennia that at-
tacks the equal humanity of the Jewish peo-
ple;
Whereas antisemitism has long per-
petrated myths about Jews, including the
Russian fabrication of the Protocols of the
Elders of Zion and the wide circulation of li-
belous falsehoods about the Jewish murder
of infants;
Whereas, in its most extreme form, anti-
semitism aims at the physical destruction of
the Jewish people, as seen in pogroms, forced
conversions and Nazi Germany’s murder of
over six million Jews;
Whereas antisemitism has included at-
tacks on the livelihood of Jews including
prohibitions on land ownership, campaigns
to boycott, confiscate or destroy Jewish
businesses, and denial of the ability of Jews
to practice certain professions;
Whereas, in the United States, Jews have
suffered from systematic discrimination in
the form of exclusion from home ownership

in certain neighborhoods, prohibition from
staying in certain hotels, restrictions upon
membership in private clubs and other asso-
ciations, limitations upon admission to cer-
tain educational institutions and other bar-
riers to equal justice under the law;
Whereas, in the United States, Jews have
faced, and continue to face, false accusations
of divided loyalty between the United States
and Israel, false claims that they purchase
political power with money, and false accu-
sations about control of the financial sys-
tem, along with other negative stereotypes;
and
Whereas Jews are the targets of the major-
ity of hate crimes committed in the United
States against any religious group, including
attacks on houses of worship and Jewish
community centers: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the United States Senate
condemns and commits to combatting all
forms of antisemitism.

HONORING ROGER ADDISON
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in honoring Roger Addison, who served as
a dedicated employee of the House of Rep-
resentatives for 31 years under six Clerks of
the House.
Born at D.C. General Hospital, Roger is a
true Washingtonian. He began his tenure as a
busboy and dishwasher in the Longworth cafe-
teria before becoming a laborer in House Fur-
nishings. Having worked as a D.C. cab driver
and chauffeur, Roger then became a driver
under former House Clerk Donnald K. Ander-
son.
Roger took computer classes and secured a
position as a Public Information Specialist in
the newly formed Legislative Resource Center.
In time, Roger was promoted to Registration
and Compliance Clerk.
He met his wife, Cassandra, while walking
in the Longworth tunnel, and he will tell you it
was love at first sight. They have been mar-
ried for 18 years. They raised six children and
have 11 grandchildren. Cassandra is respon-
sible for convincing Roger to start wearing
bowties, now his signature look.
Outside of the House, Roger is an avid golf-
er and often vacations with his family in the
Carolinas. He loves to travel, and, as many of
his colleagues will attest, he famously holds
down the dance floor during the Clerk’s annual
holiday party. He is a deacon at Ambassador
Baptist Church, and he is a Mason.
Roger is affectionately known as the ‘‘Mayor
of Capitol Hill.’’ He will be missed by his col-
leagues and the Members who have come to
know him. We all wish him the best in his
well-deserved retirement.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing Roger
Addison for his service and dedication.

OUTSTANDING COBB COUNTY
LEADER RETIRES
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to pay tribute to Jerri Barr’s thirty-five
years of exemplary service to the families
within Georgia’s 11th Congressional District
and the greater Atlanta area. Jerri is the retir-
ing CEO for the Center for Family Resources,
a non-profit social services agency in Marietta,
Georgia.
The Center for Family Resources was
founded in 1960, based on the community’s
need to streamline and simplify emergency as-
sistance in Cobb County. Community leaders
recognized that their current system, which
spread responsibility among six different agen-
cies, created opportunities for
miscommunication and slow response times
when families needed urgent aid. By consoli-
dating these responsibilities into one agency,
families were able to receive necessary assist-
ance in a timely manner.
With Jerri at the helm, the CFR grew sub-
stantially, and is now widely recognized and
emulated due to its successful practices; as
the CFR has become the gold standard for
similar agencies across the country. This
unique program not only provides vital re-
sources during difficult times to families in
Cobb County, but works with them long-term
to provide the resources necessary to become
self-reliant, free from the vicious cycle of gov-
ernment-funded resource dependency. The
Center achieves this success by offering a se-
ries of life-classes on topics such as budgeting
and parenting; they also provide GED classes
as well as help with resume writing and how
to interview for a job.
The Center for Family Resources benefits
greatly from its outstanding staff of employees
and volunteer workers, along with a highly en-
gaged and motivated Board of Directors. The
bond that has held all this together for the
past 35 years has been CEO Jerri Barr. As
this remarkable community leader prepares for
her much-deserved retirement, I want to per-
sonally thank her for her dedication to families
in need, as well as her continued commitment
to supporting a high quality of life for the citi-
zens of our Cobb County communities.

HONORING THE FUTURE FARMERS
OF AMERICA ALTERNATIVE EN-
ERGY SUSTAINABLE LOGISTICS
ACADEMY AT WHITES CREEK
HIGH SCHOOL IN NASHVILLE,
TENNESSEE
HON. JIM COOPER
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. COOPER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the Future Farmers of America Alter-
native Energy Sustainable Logistics Academy
at Whites Creek High School in Nashville,
Tennessee.
In 2016 and 2017, Whites Creek High
School Future Farmers of America Alternative
Energy Sustainable Logistics Academy, led by
the Academy instructor Dr. Garry Gibson,
grew four acres of soybeans for their biodiesel
program at the Whites Creek Community Gar-
den.
In 2016, the Academy applied for and won
the first place prize nationally and $10,000 in
the Ford Motor Challenge STEM Contest. The
2016 winnings were used to drive a biodiesel
powered vehicle for a student lecture tour up-
and-down the east coast ending at the Univer-
sity of Guelph, Canada’s top agricultural uni-
versity.
In 2017, the Academy again placed first
place nationally in the Ford Motor Challenge,
winning $20,000. The 2017 winnings are being
used by the Academy to create a student-led
solar power station at Whites Creek High
School, overseen by the Academy Principal,
Mr. Jeremiah Davis; a local solar power ad-
viser from Southern Alliance for Clean Energy,
Mr. Jason Carney; and Whites Creek High
School seniors Rachel Rhea and Daniel
Vanclief. The Academy has since created a
solar power curriculum so Whites Creek stu-
dents can continue these efforts.
The solar power station will reduce the
school’s electrical costs by an estimated
$5,000 each year. It will also keep an esti-
mated 72,072 pounds of carbon dioxide out of
the environment that would otherwise have
been created from burning coal.
I congratulate the Whites Creek High School
Future Farmers of America Alternative Energy
Sustainable Logistics Academy on their invalu-
able contributions to Middle Tennessee’s fu-
ture.

RECOGNIZING QENDRIM HAXHIU’S
COMPLETION OF THE CRITICAL
LANGUAGE SCHOLARSHIP PRO-
GRAM
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to congratulate University of Geor-
gia student Qendrim Haxhiu on his accept-
ance to, and completion of, the U.S. Depart-
ment of State’s Critical Language Scholarship
(CLS) program.
Qendrim Haxhiu from Dahlonega, Georgia
was one of only 572 students to be selected
for the 2018 CLS program—an especially re-
markable accomplishment, given this highly
competitive program received over 5,500 ap-
plications in 2018. This prestigious merit-
based scholarship allows U.S. undergraduate
and graduate students to study abroad in in-
tensive summer institutes in 14 critical lan-
guages. Scholars complete language instruc-
tion and structured cultural enrichment experi-
ences designed to promote Americans’ mas-
tery of languages that are critical to our na-
tional security and economic prosperity.
The CLS program gave Qendrim the oppor-
tunity to study in Tainan, Taiwan. His time
overseas was spent increasing his proficiency
in Chinese while being fully immersed in Tai-
wanese culture. Fully grasping the culture of
other countries is key to America’s future suc-
cess, and I commend Qendrim for his commit-
ment to sharing American values and advanc-
ing American interests abroad.
On behalf of the people of Northeast Geor-
gia, I want to congratulate Qendrim Haxhiu on
his incredible accomplishment of being award-
ed this scholarship and completing the CLS
program. I look forward to his continued suc-
cess as he utilizes his knowledge and skills to

COLUMBIA RIVER IN-LIEU AND
TREATY FISHING ACCESS SITES
IMPROVEMENT ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 29, 2019
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I
supported H.R. 91, the Columbia River In-Lieu
and Treaty Fishing Access Sites Improvement
Act, because it is important and necessary for
the in-lieu fishing sites along the Columbia
River to be properly maintained, safe and san-
itary for tribal use. These sites, which are fed-
erally controlled, were set aside by Congress
to provide fishing access to tribal fishermen
whose traditional fishing grounds were dis-
placed after the construction of dams on the
Columbia River. Because these sites are fed-
erally maintained, the bill’s authorization is
necessary to assess the sanitation and safety
in order to improve these sites tribal use. This
bill, however, does not make any determina-
tion of the sites’ boundaries nor should it be
interpreted as doing so, but should only be
taken to ensure tribes have access to tradi-
tional fishing areas on the Columbia River by
the four Columbia River Treaty tribes.

NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker,
throughout the history of the United States,
our national leaders have consistently turned
to prayer during times of struggle, adversity,
and crisis. George Washington’s prayer in Val-
ley Forge was a turning point in our war for
independence; Benjamin Franklin’s call for
prayer broke the political gridlock during the
Constitution Convention; President Franklin
Roosevelt took to the airwaves, leading the
nation in prayer as our troops landed at Nor-
mandy on D–Day; and George Patton’s prayer
for a change in weather turned the tide during
the Battle of the Bulge. More recently, I wit-
nessed firsthand the miraculous impact of
prayer during the Congressional baseball
shooting in June, 2017.
These are only a few of the numerous docu-
mented instances where Americans have indi-
vidually and collectively turned to God in pray-
er, and He has consistently answered.
The National Day of Prayer was established
by an Act of Congress, and signed into law by
President Harry S. Truman in 1952, to recog-
nize God’s hand of divine providence in the
course of our nation. Since 1988, under the
leadership of President Ronald Reagan, the
first Thursday of May has been set aside as
the official day of observance of the National
Day of Prayer.
For over two decades, the people of Bartow
County, Georgia have gathered on the Na-
tional Day of Prayer at the County Court-
house, to continue the heritage of seeking
God’s Divine guidance.
Today, May 2, 2019, in observance of the
National Day of Prayer, community leaders
and people from all across the county will
once again join together in collective prayer
for our communities, our state, and our nation.
I commend the pastors, elected officials, and
community leaders in Bartow County, Georgia
for actively recognizing the impact prayer has
on our nation.
Effective and fervent prayers are not only a
core aspect of our national past, but remain a
powerful tool in all aspects of public and pri-
vate matters, and I encourage all people to
pray for one another and our nation on this
National Day of Prayer, and every day.

IN RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT
COMMANDER FELIX MARTINEZ
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Lieutenant Commander
Felix Martinez’s retirement after 40 years of
public service. I would like to personally thank
him for his service and dedication to our na-
tion.
Lieutenant Commander Martinez has spent
the last 40 years working to serve his commu-
nity. He began by working as a college in-
structor at the City Colleges of Chicago and
then moved on to become a teacher and
baseball coach at Nelson County Schools. We
are fortunate to have someone as honorable
as Lieutenant Commander Martinez educating
our youth.
Lieutenant Commander Martinez spent the
next 30 years of his career in Military Services
with the United States Navy and United States
Marine Corps. He began his work as a US
Naval Officer with Associate Protocol. Lieuten-
ant Commander Martinez then worked as a
Research Liaison, Coordinator, Homeland De-
fense Planner, and Analyst for the US Navy.
Finally, Lieutenant Commander Martinez has
most recently served as the Senior Naval
Science Instructor for NJROTC unit at Stafford
County Schools. I wish to express my im-
mense gratitude to Lieutenant Commander
Martinez for dedicating his life to serving the
United States of America.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
recognition of Lieutenant Commander Felix
Martinez. The Commonwealth is fortunate to
have someone with such valor and commit-
ment. May God bless Lieutenant Commander
Martinez and I look forward to seeing his con-
tinued success for many years to come.

THANKING J. SPENCER
FREEBAIRN FOR HIS SERVICE
HON. KAY GRANGER
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Spencer Freebairn for his 26
years of service to the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and the American people. In
1993, a young, fresh out of college kid from
Orange County, California began his career on
Capitol Hill working for his hometown con-
gressman, former Representative Dana Rohr-
abacher. He went on to continue to serve for
Representative Jerry Lewis, the former Chair-
man and Ranking Member of the House Ap-
propriations Committee. Then we had the for-
tune of making him an honorary Texan from
‘‘far west Texas’’—serving first for Representa-
tive Roger Williams before joining my office.
I have had the privilege of calling Spencer
a friend for nearly twenty years, and my Chief
of Staff for two. While I am personally sad to
see him go, Spencer’s impact on this body will
be felt long after he departs. Along the way,
Spencer has done it all. Whether he was ad-
vocating for our men and women in uniform,
securing funding to prevent wildfires, or work-
ing to protect the rights of California dairy
farmers, his legislative accomplishments are
second to none.
Madam Speaker, on Friday, Spencer will re-
tire from the House and move on to his next
chapter. I thank Spencer for his service, and
wish him and his husband Antonio, and their
two daughters Artemis and Ariana, nothing but
the best in the future.

RECOGNIZING BRIDGET MALLO OF
BUTTE
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Bridget Mallo of Butte for in-
spiring a community to celebrate life with her
courage in facing a chronic, progressive, and
often fatal disease.
Bridget was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at
six months old. She and her family have con-
sulted doctors and been in and out of hos-
pitals for 15 years. Despite the prognosis,
Bridget never uses her illness as an excuse.
Now 15 years old, Bridget recently faced a
decision no teenager should have to bear.
Doctors said that forgoing a lung transplant
could leave Bridget with four to six weeks to
live. Proceeding with further treatment, includ-
ing an organ transplant, did not guarantee a
successful outcome and meant greater hard-
ships for her loved ones.
She chose to return home to Butte to spend
her remaining time with family and friends.
Two of her final wishes are particularly touch-
ing. She wants to ensure her mother is sup-
ported and does not face financial insecurity.
She also asked the community of Butte to
come together to celebrate life.
Bridget’s courage rallied the community, as
individuals and businesses responded with do-
nations to support the family. Bridget has also
brought awareness to the struggles families
face when a loved one is diagnosed with the
incurable disease.
In late April, residents of Butte celebrated
life and Bridget. Bridget’s loved ones, friends,
classmates, and neighbors cheered her ar-
rival. Amid much fanfare and a police escort,
there were tears of sadness and tears of joy.
Bridget has helped demonstrate the power
of community. Family, friends, and neighbors
have come together to support and celebrate
a remarkable young woman.
Bridget’s community will long remember her
big heart. Because of Bridget, they will also

TRIBUTE TO DR. JIM WADE
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer
these remarks in tribute to Dr. Jim Wade of
Abingdon, Virginia, who has used his talents
as a surgeon to help needy people around the
globe.
Dr. Wade was born and raised in Princeton,
West Virginia. He attended West Virginia Uni-
versity as an undergraduate and then contin-
ued at its School of Medicine specializing in
otolaryngology. After completing his medical
studies, he served as an officer in the U.S.
Army for five years, rising to the rank of lieu-
tenant colonel. He then had a medical practice
in Abingdon from 1978 to 2013.
In Abingdon, Dr. Wade has been an active
member of his community. He attends
Abingdon Bible Church, serves on various
boards, and provides a home for foreign in-
terns when they are training in the country.
Dr. Wade’s deep faith, compassion for oth-
ers, and medical skills guided him to the field
of medical missions. He began volunteering
with the faith-based charity World Medical Mis-
sion in May 1996, traveling to Kenya, per-
forming cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries.
Working with World Medical Mission and
BethanyKids in the years since, Dr. Wade has
traveled to Kenya 25 times, South Sudan
three times, Egypt twice, South Sudan twice,
and Myanmar to perform these surgeries. Fre-
quently operating in areas undergoing political
and social unrest and lacking the comforts of
home, he conducts an average of four sur-
geries a day during twelve-hour shifts in the
operating room.
His selfless and humble service to others
has been a gift in the lives of many, from the
children who benefit from his medical skills to
the colleagues inspired by his example. I com-
mend Dr. Wade for his good works and for the
generous and caring spirit in which he has
done them.

RECOGNIZING TAYLOR BOYER
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, for
nearly two decades, the U.S. Department of
State’s Benjamin A. Gilman International Stu-
dent Program has afforded qualified American
students the ability to study abroad. To date,
over 28,000 outstanding Americans rep-
resenting 1,300 colleges and universities have
studied in over 150 countries as part of this
program. Students selected represent diverse
backgrounds and engage in a unique edu-
cational experience that gives them skills re-
lated to national security and economic com-
petitiveness.
I rise today to recognize the prestigious ac-
complishment of my constituent, Taylor Boyer
of Doylestown, who received a Benjamin A.
Gilman International Scholarship to study
abroad in Belize during the 2017–2018 aca-
demic year while a student at Delaware Valley
University.
On behalf of all residents of the First Con-

DONNA GRADEL
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA

Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today
in honor of an outstanding educator. Okla-
homa’s 2018 Teacher of the Year, Ms. Donna
Gradel, a finalist for the National Teacher of
the Year.
Ms. Gradel has dedicated nearly 30 years of
her life to education. The success of her stu-
dents at Broken Arrow High School reflects
the passion and dedication that Ms. Gradel
brings to teaching.
Oklahoma is home to many wonderful edu-
cators. Ms. Gradel is a standard-bearer of
educational excellence in my state and my
district, and she continues to impress us and
her peers across the country.
Ms. Gradel is well-deserving of her position
as a finalist for Teacher of the Year. She rep-
resents Oklahoma and our country well and
has the support of our entire delegation.
Congratulations to Ms. Gradel on this pro-
found honor.

CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF MASIMO CORPORATION
HON. KATIE PORTER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize the 30th anniversary of
Masimo Corporation, a healthcare technology
company based in Irvine, California, and to
celebrate its innovation and commitment to im-
proving patient safety around the world.
Masimo has helped solve the ‘‘unsolvable’’ by
introducing lifesaving breakthroughs in
noninvasive patient monitoring.
Masimo’s founder, chairman, and chief ex-
ecutive officer, Joe Kiani, immigrated to the
United States when he was 9 years old and
only spoke three words of English. Originally
trained as an electrical engineer, he thrived in
his new home and graduated early from both
high school and San Diego State University.
In 1989, at age 24, Mr. Kiani had an idea
that would significantly improve the accuracy
and reliability of one of the most commonly
used monitoring technologies in health care:
the pulse oximeter. By attaching to your finger,
the pulse oximeter measures how much oxy-
gen is in the blood within seconds. With a
$40,000 loan against his condo in Orange
County, Mr. Kiani started his company in a lo-
cation that many successful California compa-
nies often do—in a garage. Today, Masimo
Corporation’s Irvine headquarters can be rec-
ognized as the set for Stark Enterprises in the
first ‘‘Iron Man’’ movie.
Before Masimo Corporation was founded,
pulse oximeters frequently produced false
alerts based on a variety of factors and the
patient’s movements. Mr. Kiani applied a tech-
nology called adaptive filters, used in sub-
marine warfare and communication, and cre-
ated Masimo SET Measure-through Motion
and Low Perfusion pulse oximetry. This tech-
nology reduced false alarms by 95 percent,
and its high degree of sensitivity pioneered
new findings—from previously undetectable
heart problems in newborns to reducing blind-
ness in premature babies by enabling clini-
cians to better target oxygen levels provided in
neonatal care.
Since its founding, Masimo has grown into
a successful publicly traded company employ-
ing more than 4,600 people worldwide, with
annual revenues of nearly $800 million. The
company has more than 600 patents, and
Masimo’s technology improves the health out-
comes of an estimated 100 million patients
worldwide each year.
The journey of Mr. Kiani and Masimo is an
American story rooted in entrepreneurial spirit
and grit. Its worldwide success has created
jobs, nurtured research, and improved patient
safety. On behalf of the 45th Congressional
District, congratulations for 30 years of pro-
viding lifesaving and life-altering health care.

RECOGNIZING THE MONTEREY
BAY NATIONAL MARINE SANC-
TUARY’S 20TH ANNUAL SNAP-
SHOT DAY
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Monterey Bay National Ma-
rine Sanctuary as they celebrate their 20th
Snapshot Day. This annual event brings vol-
unteers together at over 250 sampling sites on
the central coast of California as they collect
valuable data on the water quality of the wa-
tersheds that drain into the Monterey Bay Na-
tional Marine Sanctuary.
The first Snapshot Day was organized in
2000 when the Monterey Bay National Marine
Sanctuary collaborated with the Coastal Wa-
tershed Council and the Center for Marine
Conservation to organize a volunteer effort to
better understand land-based sources of
ocean pollution in the sanctuary. With a better
understanding of the sources of pollution from
the 10 watersheds directly connected to the
sanctuary, local agencies, stakeholders, and
citizens can better protect the water quality
along 276 miles of shoreline across four
coastal counties that are home to more than
1.8 million residents. These protected waters
support a wealth of biological diversity, coastal
scenery, and recreational and business oppor-
tunities.
Snapshot Day depends on a small army of
volunteers who measure bodies of water for
temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conduc-
tivity, and turbidity and collect samples that

will be tested in a laboratory for nutrients and
bacteria levels. These assessments test the
overall health of the water as well as any
threats to aquatic organisms, fish, and hu-
mans. Through this work, volunteers become
environmental stewards and ambassadors for
the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary
and local watersheds. Since 2000, a total of
3,783 volunteers have donated 18,915 hours
of their time to monitor any of the Snapshot
Day sites.
Since its beginning in 2000, Snapshot Day
has shown how engaged volunteers can make
a critical impact in their community. Madam
Speaker, I ask that my distinguished col-
leagues join me in recognizing the Monterey
Bay National Marine Sanctuary as they cele-
brate their 20th Snapshot Day.

HONORING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE POLISH AMERICAN
CONGRESS
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Polish
American Congress. I am pleased to recog-
nize such an esteemed organization that has
enriched the cultural landscape of our nation
and strengthened America’s friendship with
Poland. I am proud to have worked closely for
many years with Polish American Congress
President Frank Spula in Chicago.
Established near the end of World War II,
the Polish American Congress gave voice to
the shared Polish-American interest in a free
Poland and in defeating the Axis powers. After
World War II ended, the organization played a
leading role in international efforts to secure a
prosperous and independent post-war Poland.
During the Cold War, the organization en-
gaged in further work to bolster relations be-
tween our two countries, through pushing for
American recognition of the Polish western
border, securing support for Radio Free Eu-
rope, and advocating on behalf of Polish immi-
grants.
Today, the Polish American Congress
stands as a federation of over 3,000 Polish
American organizations including veteran, cul-
tural, professional, religious, and social asso-
ciations, and represents over 10 million Ameri-
cans of Polish descent and origin. Throughout
its rich history, the Polish American Congress
has been highly successful in ensuring strong
economic cooperation and promoting civic,
educational, and cultural programs to further
artistic and intellectual exchanges.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing the Polish American Con-
gress on its 75th anniversary. Chicagoland is
fortunate to have the most robust Polish-
American community in our nation. I am proud
to be a Polish-American and to represent so
many others in my district. I have witnessed
firsthand the exceptional contributions of the
Polish American Congress. I know this organi-
zation will continue its important work for
many years into the future.
RECOGNIZING JASMINE WATT,
DELEGATE TO THE 2019 CON-
GRESS OF FUTURE MEDICAL
LEADERS
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to congratulate Jasmine Carol
Watt on her nomination and selection as a
Delegate to the 2019 Congress of Future
Medical Leaders. She will represent the great
State of Georgia and White County High
School at the event in Boston, Massachusetts.
Selection as a Delegate to the Congress of
Future Medical Leaders is an incredible honor.
The goal of the Congress is to identify high-
achieving high school students who aspire to
become physicians or medical scientists and
provide them with the guidance and
mentorship needed to succeed.
To become a Delegate, one must have a
proven record of academic achievement. Jas-
mine greatly exceeded that requirement with
her near-perfect GPA. While maintaining a
stellar GPA, Jasmine also participates in the
White County High School concert and march-
ing bands as a percussionist.
From an early age, Jasmine was always in-
trigued by the possibility of a career in the
medical profession. Inspired by her mother, a
law enforcement officer, she originally ex-
pressed interest in forensic sciences but later
turned her attention to becoming a nurse in
the operating room, where her aunt works.
The Congress of Future Medical Leaders is
an incredible opportunity for Jasmine to ac-
quire the knowledge and leadership skills nec-
essary to succeed in the medical profession. I
am proud to congratulate her on this well-de-
served honor, and I wish her all the best in
her future endeavors.

TRIBUTE HONORING THE ANCES-
TRAL REBURIAL HOSTED BY
THE GULLAH SOCIETY
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor 36 individuals of African de-
scent whose remains were unearthed at
Gailliard Center in Charleston, South Carolina
in 2013. These souls, whose stories are un-
known, were buried in unmarked graves and
their resting site was later buried under con-
struction as the city grew. While they may
have been forgotten in their time, they are not
forgotten today. I commend the Gullah Society
and the City of Charleston for honoring these
individuals by holding a naming ceremony and
ancestral reburial celebration to honor these
souls and recognize their contributions to
Charleston’s history.
What we do know is that these 36 individ-
uals—men, women and children—were either
born in Africa or were of African descent.
Thanks to the efforts of the Gullah Society,
analysis has been done that dates the original
burial of these souls to between 1750 and
1800. Yet the site was never recognized as a
burial ground. These souls were almost cer-
tainly enslaved people and endured prejudices
and abuses throughout their life.
Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in his great
work Democracy in America; ‘‘The greatness
of America lies not in being more enlightened
than any other nation, but rather in her ability
to repair her faults.’’ The reburial celebration is
one step towards acknowledging this impor-
tant part of history and repairing this fault.
We have an obligation to preserve the rich
history of this country. Celebrations like this
provide an opportunity to rejoice in the contin-
ued preservation of not just historic events but
of the people who made this country what it is
today.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my col-
leagues join me in celebrating this historic oc-
casion that recognizes the contributions of
these 36 souls and all of the similarly situated
that they represent. Without the vigilance of
the Gullah Society and the City of Charleston
this recognition would not be possible; and I
add my enduring gratitude for the tremendous
work they have done to make this day pos-
sible.

THE PASSING OF JUDGE DAMON
KEITH
HON. JOHN LEWIS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
tribute to Judge Damon Keith. He was a great
American and a brilliant federal judge.
Over the years, I had the honor of meeting
Judge Keith a few times. He was always gra-
cious and thoughtful.
Appointed by Presidents Johnson and
Carter, Judge Keith worked for more than half
a century to help our nation realize the dream
of a more perfect union.
He spent every single day committed to
helping our country respect the dignity, worth,
and equality of every human being—whether it
was their right to vote, education, housing,
employment, or privacy.
Madam Speaker, today, my thoughts are
with his family, friends, and community, who
were kind enough to share this amazing man
with a grateful nation.

RECOGNITION OF THE PASSING OF
THE HONORABLE STAN FURMAN
HON. GREG STANTON

Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, today I
want to recognize the Honorable Stan Furman
who passed away on April 1, 2019 at the age
of 87 in Phoenix, Arizona.
The two-term Arizona State Senator was
born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1932 and experi-
enced a humble, often difficult upbringing. He
lost both his parents before he turned 10
years old and spent his formative years in the
Vista Del Mar orphanage in Los Angeles.
This experience shaped him, contributing to
his strong beliefs in justice and equal rights. It
formed Stan’s social conscience as he devel-
oped a profound need to stand up for those
who couldn’t stand up for themselves. That

time also instilled his deep love and apprecia-
tion of his family and friends—people he never
took for granted.
From 1952 to 1956, Stan served our country
in the U.S. Air Force which took him to Japan
during the Korean War. After an honorable
discharge, Stan moved to Mexico City where
he earned a degree in business and foreign
trade from Mexico City College. His time in
Mexico would forever change the course of his
life.
It was there that he met Gloria, his soulmate
and wife of 58 years. They married in Mexico
City in 1960 and moved back to California
where Stan worked for a fabric wholesaler.
Their three children were born in California.
In 1969, the Furman family moved to Phoe-
nix where Stan opened and managed a new
branch for the fabric company. After some
years in Arizona, Gloria entered local politics
as a volunteer, which inspired Stan to get in-
volved-and ultimately led to him running for
public office himself.
Stan was elected to the Arizona State Sen-
ate and served two terms from 1991 to 1995.
During his tenure, Stan focused on the issues
that were instilled in him early on: civil rights,
criminal justice, education. He served with
compassion and dignity, always motivated by
doing the right thing. He advocated for the
1992 referendum to make Martin Luther King,
Jr. Day a paid state holiday in Arizona—an ac-
complishment that made him incredibly proud.
And between his lawmaking, he found time to
volunteer, and encouraged his colleagues in
the legislature to volunteer at a local elemen-
tary school, too.
After leaving elected office, Stan’s passion
for service never wavered. He served on
many Arizona boards and commissions and
worked for the Arizona Corporation Commis-
sion. Following many years of extensive work
with the Arizona Civil Liberties Union, Stan
served as the President of ACLU Arizona from
2002 to 2006 and was honored to be named
Arizona Civil Libertarian of the Year in 1995.
He also served for several years on the Na-
tional ACLU Board of Directors. It was no sur-
prise, when in 1998; Stan was named ‘‘ Medi-
ator of the Year’’ by the Phoenix Community
Mediation Program.
In his personal life, Stan was a man of
many passions. He was an avid tennis player
and golfer, quick-witted and a natural joke tell-
er. He loved crossword puzzles and all word
games. He enjoyed playing board games and
online games with his children and grand-
children. He loved going to the beach while
enjoying time at the family’s vacation home in
Rocky Point, Mexico. But those close to Stan
knew that his work brought him as much joy
as any of his hobbies. Stan Furman is sur-
vived by his wife and love of his life, Gloria,
his daughters Diane (Randy) and Susan, his
son Phil (Deb), his grandsons Spencer, Dylan,
Nate, Harrison, Alex (Jessi), Hugo and Oscar,
and his great-granddaughter Cheyanne.
Stan had a life well lived and will be deeply
missed.
HONORING THE POLISH HIGH-
LANDERS ALLIANCE OF NORTH
AMERICA ON ITS 90TH ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the Polish Highlanders Alliance of
North America as the organization prepares to
celebrate its 90th anniversary. It is a privilege
to represent so many Polish Highlanders and
to have the organization’s headquarters just a
few blocks from my district.
The Polish Highlanders Alliance traces its
roots back to 1929 when its first chapter,
known as a circle, was founded in Chicago.
Since its inception, the Alliance has sought to
organize Polish Highlanders throughout North
America into a unified Highlander family. For
the last 90 years, members of the Alliance
have worked hard to preserve the unique cul-
tural heritage of the Polish Highland region, in-
cluding music, dance, folk costumes, and
other traditions. Through the years, the organi-
zation has grown to over 80 circles throughout
the U.S. and Canada.
Today, the Polish Highlanders Alliance is
headquartered on the Southwest Side of Chi-
cago in the Highlander Home on Archer Ave-
nue. The Alliance organizes many cultural
events for the Highlander and the Polish-
American community including the Highlander
Picnic which attracts nearly 3,000 people
every year. For its numerous cultural activities,
the Alliance has received awards including the
Gloria Artis Cultural Achievement Medal. The
medal was awarded by the Ministry of Culture
and National Heritage of the Republic of Po-
land for the Alliance’s distinguished contribu-
tions to Polish culture. In addition to cultural
activities, the Polish Highlanders Alliance
raises money to provide assistance to church-
es, schools, and other establishments within
Poland and the Highland region.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing all that the Polish High-
landers Alliance of North America does to pro-
mote unique Polish cultural traditions and to
support strong ties between Poland and the
U.S. The members’ devotion to their commu-
nity and their mission is commendable and I
wish them the best as they continue to impart
their traditions for generations to come. One

PRAISING THE PERSEVERANCE OF
BRIAN SCHNELLE
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to commend Brian Schnelle who will graduate
from college on Saturday at the age of 30.
Brian had a rough start in life and has over-
come many obstacles. Born in Modesto, Cali-
fornia, in a hospital serving a mostly indigent
population, baby Brian and his biological
mother somehow made it to a Truckstops of
America near downtown Nashville. There his
mother got into an altercation and was jailed
and Brian ended up in foster care. After
months of custody battles, his mother left town
and the Schnelle family of Nashville was free
to adopt the three-year-old on July 3, 1991.
As a toddler, Brian loved books, cars, and
trains and every Kidsongs video on the mar-
ket. His new family took him to the library,
read him books and took him where he could
see trains, planes and 18-wheelers. But it was
clear Brian had health issues, including need-
ing breathing treatments for asthma, and he
was labelled as having ADD, ADHD and finally
Asperger’s Syndrome. Brian was verbal but
lacked many of the social skills of kids his
age. School was not easy, but Brian’s even-
tual academic success came about when he
began attending Genesis Academy which
could meet his special needs. Brian graduated
with a regular high school diploma after taking
the Tennessee Gateway Test three times. It
was then he announced he wanted to go to
college and major in sports management.
Brian had always been an avid fan of Univer-
sity of Tennessee sports—especially women’s
basketball, women’s volleyball and women’s
softball.
Trevecca Nazarene University in Nashville
was the best choice for Brian to pursue his
dream of getting a college degree. The Uni-
versity has recognized his efforts by creating
a special award, the Brian Schnelle Persever-
ance Award, which will be presented annually
to future persistent students. It took 12 years,
but Brian graduates with a Bachelor of
Science degree in Sports Management—with
honors—on Saturday.
I want to congratulate Brian and the entire
Schnelle family, including his sister, my legis-
lative assistant Alex Schnelle, for this major
accomplishment, and wish them all a bright fu-
ture.

inducted into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame
in recognition of his tremendous career as the
head basketball coach at Newark High School

Over the course of his twenty-seven years
coaching the Newark Wildcats, Gary and his
athletes racked up a 477–199 record, winning
twelve league championships, 17 sectional
championships, seven district championships

Gary’s results on the court were only pos-

the court. He set high standards and helped
generations of young men achieve them. Hav-
ing grown up as a multi-sport athlete himself,
Gary knew all too well the special impact a
good coach can have on those under his

TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN G.
MOUSHEGIAN
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer
these remarks in tribute to Stephen G.
Moushegian of Salem, Virginia, a hero of the
Vietnam War who died on March 22 at the
age of 74.
Born on January 22, 1945, Steve was not a
stranger to military life in his younger years,
as his father had graduated from West Point
and served in World War II. Steve began his
service in the U.S. Army as a member of the
Reserve Officers’ Training Corps at the Uni-
versity of Georgia. Upon commissioning, he
entered flight school and excelled as a pilot.
When Steve was deployed to Vietnam, he
opted for a risky assignment: flying helicopters
for reconnaissance missions. He quickly
proved his courage and skill at the task. Al-
though the North Vietnamese would target his
helicopter as it scouted for U.S. forces, he
would persist in reconnoitering their positions,
even at times after his helicopter was hit by
enemy fire. His daring missions gathered valu-
able intelligence for the U.S. military and
earned him several decorations, including a
Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal,
Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Silver Star, and
Distinguished Flying Cross.
In September 1969, Steve’s helicopter took
enemy fire, and he was wounded in the arms,
shoulder, and left eye. The eye injury blinded
him in that eye, so he was sent home with a
Purple Heart. Notwithstanding the serious inju-
ries he sustained, he treasured his service to
the country he loved.
Steve worked as a medical salesman after
his service in the Army, and occasionally I
would have the pleasure of joining him and his
lunch buddies. He is survived by his wife of 52
years, Ricki, his children Jeff, Christie Shaps,
and Suzi, and six grandchildren. His son Jeff
served in the Army after graduating from Vir-
ginia Military Institute, and his grandson also
plans on a military career after completing his
course of study at the same institution. We all
can take inspiration from the life of Steve
Moushegian, a loving father, husband, and pa-
triot who served his country in the skies over
Vietnam with valor.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE AND
SERVICE OF LEONARD MCNEIL
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and service of
Leonard McNeil, a long-time resident of West
Contra Costa County.
Leonard first discovered his passion for ad-
vocacy while attending California State Univer-
sity, Fresno and was a founding member of
the campus’s Black Student Union. A strong
opponent of the Vietnam War, Leonard pro-
tested the draft by moving to Canada, where
he helped create the Vancouver Black Action
Group and demonstrated against the Vietnam
War and British and Canadian imperialism.
After returning to the United States in the
1970s, Leonard completed a vocational pro-
gram at the University of California, Berkeley
and was an ironworker for over 15 years. In
that capacity, he worked within his union to
fight the exploitation of immigrant workers and
end discriminatory practices.
Leonard then pursued a career in local poli-
tics and served on the San Pablo City Council.
During his tenure, McNeil helped create af-
fordable housing programs, pushed for free
public internet access, created the San Pablo
Economic Development Corporation, and sup-
ported programs that aimed to improve rela-
tions between the police department and the
community.
Leonard was also a professor of Political
Science at Contra Costa College, a position
he held for nearly 10 years. As a professor, he
pushed students to think critically and engage
in political discussions.
Leonard will be sorely missed and his last-
ing impact will long be remembered in the
East Bay community.

CONGRATULATING THE UNIVER-
SITY OF NORTH GEORGIA RANG-
ER CHALLENGE TEAM
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to congratulate the University of
North Georgia’s (UNG) Ranger Challenge
team for placing third overall in the 2019
Sandhurst Military Skills Competition.
The Sandhurst competition is the world’s
premier international military skills competition
with over 50 teams traveling to the U.S. Mili-
tary Academy at West Point each year to
compete against the best military academies
in the world. The competition is designed to
test each team’s mental, physical and leader-
ship readiness that is necessary to foster
group cohesiveness and achieve excellence.
Established in 1873, the University of North
Georgia is one of the six senior military col-
leges in the United States. The University es-
tablished the ROTC program in 1916, and
their Corps of Cadets currently encompasses
over 700 members. These cadets compete
and succeed on a national scale, winning the
ROTC cup for the second year in a row and
placing third overall out of 49 teams. UNG
was the only team not from the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point to finish in the top
five, and they finished ahead of 14 of West
Point’s 16 teams, in addition to teams from the
U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Coast
Guard.
As an alumnus of the University of North
Georgia, I know the level of commitment and
courage it takes for the Corps of Cadets to
compete on a world stage. With the team im-
proving from their Fourth Place position in
2018, it is no surprise that they are already
diligently working to achieve first place in the
coming years.
On behalf of the people of Northeast Geor-
gia, I want to congratulate the University of
North Georgia Ranger Challenge team for
their success. They continue to produce hard-
working and dedicated cadets that serve our
country honorably in the United States and
abroad.

JIM GORMAN RETIREMENT
HON. TROY BALDERSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and achievements
of James ‘‘Jim’’ Gorman, in honor of his retire-
ment from the Gorman-Rupp Company in
Mansfield, Ohio.
Since its founding in 1933, the Gorman-
Rupp Company has been known worldwide for
its quality pumps and pump systems. When
Jim first joined the board of directors in 1946,
he began a journey spanning more than seven
decades. For 73 years, Jim has worked tire-
lessly to uphold the renowned Gorman-Rupp
Company reputation and build its global suc-
cess.
Jim’s service didn’t begin in the private sec-
tor, however. In 1942, amidst the height of
World War II, Jim answered his nation’s call
and joined the United States Army as a C-47
cargo plane pilot, where he risked life and limb
to defend the principle of freedom. His lifelong
dedication to service for his country and com-
munity didn’t end there. After World War II,
Jim served in the Air Force Reserves until the
Guard unit was opened in June 1948, where
he served until 1956.
After his time in the military, Jim returned
home to Mansfield, Ohio to devote himself to
the eponymous company his father co-found-
ed. As a salesman, Jim traveled the country
selling the pumps and pump systems the
Gorman-Rupp Company designs and manu-
factures. It didn’t take long for Jim’s staunch
work ethic to earn him the respect and admi-
ration of his colleagues.
As far back as 1948, Jim has repeatedly
been quoted as saying he believes in treating
his employees as he would like to be treated.
This unwavering commitment to his employ-
ees remains through this very day and sets an
example for job creators everywhere.
Jim’s life and career are marked by decades
of profound, yet humbly-and dutifully-carried-
out service to others. I’m confident that’s Jim’s
impact will be an enduring one, and that his
work will be cherished by generations to

RECOGNIZING THE 175TH FOUND-
ING ANNIVERSARY OF MARION
COUNTY, FLORIDA
HON. TED S. YOHO
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would like to
take this time to commemorate the 175th An-
niversary of the founding of Marion County,
Florida.
I have the honor of representing part of this
county, alongside Representatives NEAL DUNN
and DANIEL WEBSTER.
For the past 175 years, Marion County has
been at the heart of Florida’s rich history and
continues to be an important part of Florida
today. The county boasts significant economic
development and the title of‘‘Horse Capital of
the World.’’
Marion County is constantly growing and is
an industry leader in the agriculture, equine
and forestry industries. The success of these
industries can be attributed to the hard-work-
ing and dedicated individuals in the commu-
nity.
As we celebrate this significant anniversary,
we must reflect on the contributions that Mar-
ion County has made to the great state of
Florida and the nation. I look forward to the
continued success of the Marion County com-
munity. Congratulations.

RESPONDING TO THE CHABAD OF
POWAY SYNAGOGUE ATTACK
HON. MIKE LEVIN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to mark a tragic day for San
Diegans, Californians, and all Americans.
On the last day of Passover and exactly six
months since the Tree of Life Synagogue
shooting in Pittsburgh, yet another attack took
place, once again by an evil, hate-filled, anti-
Semitic individual who was armed with an as-
sault rifle. At the Chabad of Poway Syna-
gogue located just outside of my district in
Southern California, Mrs. Lori Kaye was
senselessly murdered, and three other people
were seriously injured.
There were many heroes on that day, in-
cluding an off-duty Border Patrol Agent and an
Army veteran who helped stop the gunman,
and I am so grateful to them for saving lives
and helping their community.
Our response to this attack cannot end now
that the violence in Poway is over. It is up to
each and everyone one of us—elected offi-
cials and everyday citizens alike—to confront
the hate, bigotry, and anti-Semitism that per-
sists in our society.
We must also take strong and decisive ac-
tion to end the epidemic of gun violence in this
country. Earlier this year, the House passed
HR8, which would put common sense gun
safety measures in place. We know it will help
end the plague of senseless gun violence, and
I implore the Senate to take up this bipartisan
legislation immediately.
We need to bring together members of all
religions, backgrounds, and political parties to
address the hate and violence behind this at-
tack, and that’s what I intend to do over the
coming weeks, months, and years.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEWTON
APPLE TREE PLANTED AT BILLY
EARL DADE MIDDLE SCHOOL
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 2, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
as the Chairwoman of the House Committee
on Science, Space, and Technology, I am
proud to have the opportunity to donate a di-
rect descendant of the apple tree that inspired
Sir Isaac Newton’s theory of gravity to Billy
Earl Dade Middle School in honor of Arbor
Day 2019. In the past several years, Billy Earl
Dade Middle School has become a national
example of how strong campus leadership and
the surrounding community can vastly improve
the quality of education and experience of-
fered to students.
I’d like to thank the National Institute of
Standards and Technology for making this do-
nation possible by providing a sapling from
their Newton apple tree in Gaithersburg, Mary-
land.
In the mid-17th century, while on leave from
Cambridge University, Isaac Newton was sit-
ting beneath a tree when he saw an apple fall
to the ground. This moment captured his curi-
osity, and he began to wonder if the same
force that drew the apple towards the center
of the earth similarly affected the moon and
the planets. It was that day that inspired New-
ton to begin development of his law of uni-
versal gravitation. Nearly three and a half cen-
turies later, scientists are still trying to under-
stand gravity.
Just as the ancestor of this tree inspired Sir
Isaac Newton, who went on to formulate his
laws of motion and become one of the most
esteemed and influential scientists of all time,
I hope this apple tree inspires the students,
faculty, and mentors that attend and visit Billy
Earl Dade Middle School to continue acting as
role models in the community and to pursue
new ideas in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics.
