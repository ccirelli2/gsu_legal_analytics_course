DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER
PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable JAMES P.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:
We give You thanks, O God, for giv-
ing us another day.
As You make available to Your peo-
ple the grace and knowledge to meet
the needs of the day, we pray that Your
spirit will be upon the Members of this
people’s House, giving them the rich-
ness of Your wisdom.
Pour forth that wisdom as the days
of the shutdown drag on. So many
Americans suffer without the resources
needed to pay their bills, nor the assur-
ance that their financial futures are se-
cure.
May the power of Your truth and our
faith in Your providence give them all
the confidence they must have to do
the good work required for service to
our Nation.
May all that is done this day be for
Your greater honor and glory.
Amen.

THE JOURNAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair has examined the Journal of the
last day’s proceedings and announces
to the House his approval thereof.
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to
clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on
agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of
the Journal.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the Speaker’s approval
of the Journal.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I object to
the vote on the ground that a quorum
is not present and make the point of
order that a quorum is not present.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8, rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.
The point of no quorum is considered
withdrawn.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the
gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROY-
BAL-ALLARD) come forward and lead
the House in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD led the
Pledge of Allegiance as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,

MCKENZIE, TENNESSEE, 150TH
ANNIVERSARY
(Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
town of McKenzie, Tennessee, which is
located in Carroll County. McKenzie’s
yearlong celebration commemorating
150 years since their proclamation be-
gins this week.
The town of McKenzie has persevered
through epidemics, wars, and two great
fires. In 150 years, McKenzie has grown
from a population of 500 people to over
5,000 people, and over 10,000 residents
outside the city limits. The town was
visited by President Grover Cleveland
and is home to the Tennessee College
of Applied Technology at McKenzie and
the fastest growing private university
in Tennessee, Bethel University, which
is led by my good friend, President
Walter Butler.
I congratulate the town of McKenzie,
its Mayor Jill Holland, Carroll County
Mayor Joseph Butler, and its residents
on a remarkable 150-year history.
McKenzie has shown great resilience,
and I wish it nothing but the best on
its next 150.

LET’S CONTINUE PROGRESS MADE
TO BETTER LIVES OF VETERANS
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to speak on H.R. 433, the Veterans’
Entry to Apprenticeship Act, which I
introduced 2 weeks ago.
While a lot of progress has been made
over the past few years in reducing the
number of unemployed veterans in
America, the latest data shows that
around 370,000 remain unemployed as of
2017.
Last year, the House of Representa-
tives passed several bills that improved
the lives of our veterans specifically
related to healthcare. My bill would
keep this momentum going.
Here is the short of it: Right now,
veterans are not allowed to use their

GI Bill benefits to cover the cost of De-
partment of Labor-approved pre-ap-
prenticeship programs, such as train-
ing in welding or training in carpentry.
This bill would change that and allow
those who have served our country to
learn skills that will better prepare
them for apprenticeships and, ulti-
mately, the workforce.
This bill will continue the progress
we have made to better the lives of vet-
erans who have served this country
honorably, and I ask my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to join me in
this effort.

NATIONAL SCHOOL CHOICE WEEK
(Mr. LAMBORN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of H.R. 44, designating this
week as National School Choice Week.
There are many paths to a successful
education, including traditional public
schools and charter schools, magnet
schools, and homeschooling.
Finding the right path can include
finding a school where a child feels safe
and can build friendships, meeting the
needs of a disabled child or playing to
a student’s strengths in a magnet
school.
School choice is about empowering
parents to make educational decisions
for their children. It can allow minor-
ity children to escape poorly run, sta-
tus quo schools.
There is no one-size-fits-all school
system for our students, and I am
happy to support National School
Choice Week, along with every family
and community that is seeking the
best possible education for their chil-
dren.
f
STOP ROE V. WADE FUNDING
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this
week marks the 46th anniversary of
Roe v. Wade, bringing us close to 50
years since unborn children have not
had legal protection.
Since then, there have been an esti-
mated 60.9 million abortions in Amer-
ica. In 2018, an unborn child was abort-
ed every 34 seconds, on average.
These aren’t new statistics, but they
are still shocking and horrifying to
those of us who believe that all life is
sacred.
The country is split nearly in half
when it comes to being pro-life or pro-
choice, but a majority of Americans
don’t believe their tax dollars should
be used to fund abortions.
The largest provider of abortions in
the United States, Planned Parent-
hood, is taxpayer subsidized, despite re-
porting over $1.4 billion in revenue for
2016–2017.
It is big business. Planned Parent-
hood makes millions each year pro-
viding over one-third of the Nation’s
abortions.
It is unconscionable that millions of
Americans are forced to contribute tax
dollars to create profit for an industry
they are fundamentally or morally op-
posed to.
If only they understood the whole
truth on the abortion industry and how
much it hurts women and the unborn.

HONORED TO ATTEND MOUNT AL-
OYSIUS COLLEGE MLK PRAYER
SERVICE
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, I was honored
to be at Mount Aloysius College to par-
ticipate in its Martin Luther King Jr.
Day prayer service.
Located in Cresson, Pennsylvania,
Pennsylvania’s 15th Congressional Dis-
trict, Mount Aloysius College planned
events throughout this week to honor
the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. The activities include
community service projects, diversity
talks, art exhibits, and more.
Mr. Speaker, it was a privilege to
join the students, faculty, and staff on
Monday during a truly moving prayer
service in Cosgrave Lobby. The service
featured several readers who shared Dr.
King’s powerful words, and everyone in
attendance sang hymns.
Yesterday, the college hosted a
multicultural food day. Today, at 3:30
p.m., a special guest speaker from
Carlow University will be featured at
Alumni Hall. Friday concludes Martin
Luther King Week at Mount Aloysius
College with an exhibit in the Cosgrave
Lobby and a poetry night for all the re-
gional college students at a location in
Ebensburg, Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to be able
to meet so many wonderful Mount Alo-
ysius students, and I thank them for
hosting me.

FURTHER CONTINUING APPRO-
PRIATIONS FOR DEPARTMENT
OF HOMELAND SECURITY, 2019
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
pursuant to House Resolution 61, I call
up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 31)
making further continuing appropria-
tions for the Department of Homeland
Security for fiscal year 2019, and for
other purposes, and ask for its imme-
diate consideration.
The Clerk read the title of the joint
resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 61, the joint
resolution is considered read.
The text of the joint resolution is as
follows:
H.J. RES. 31
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. The Continuing Appropriations
Act, 2019 (division C of Public Law 115–245) is
further amended—
(1) in section 105—
(A) in paragraph (2), by striking ‘‘or’’ at
the end;
(B) in paragraph (3)—
(i) by inserting ‘‘except as provided in
paragraph (4),’’ before ‘‘December’’; and
(ii) by striking the period at the end and
inserting ‘‘; or’’; and
(C) by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(4) with respect to appropriations and
funds made available, and other authorities
granted, pursuant to section 101(5) of this
joint resolution for the Department of Home-
land Security, February 28, 2019.’’; and
(2) in section 110, by adding at the end the
following:
‘‘(c) With respect to mandatory payments
whose budget authority was provided in the
Department of Homeland Security Appro-
priations Act, 2018 (division F of Public Law
115–141), subsections (a) and (b) shall be ap-
plied by substituting ‘section 105(4)’ for ‘sec-
tion 105(3)’ each place it appears.’’.
SEC. 2. (a) Amounts appropriated by oper-
ation of the amendments made by section 1
for the salaries and expenses of employees
shall be available for payment of salaries in
accordance with section 1341(c) of title 31,
United States Code (as added by the Govern-
ment Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019).
(b) All obligations incurred in anticipation
of the appropriations made and authority
granted by this joint resolution for the pur-
poses of maintaining the essential level of
activity to protect life and property and
bringing about orderly termination of Gov-
ernment functions, and for purposes as oth-
erwise authorized by law, are hereby ratified
and approved if otherwise in accord with the
provisions of this joint resolution, and for
purposes of such obligations the time period
covered by this joint resolution shall be con-
sidered to include the period beginning on or
about December 22, 2018, during which there
occurred a lapse in appropriations.
SEC. 3. (a) If a State (or another Federal
grantee) used State funds (or the grantee’s
non-Federal funds) to continue carrying out
a Federal program or furloughed State em-
ployees (or the grantee’s employees) whose
compensation is advanced or reimbursed in
whole or in part by the Federal Govern-
ment—
(1) such furloughed employees shall be
compensated at their standard rate of com-
pensation for such period;
(2) the State (or such other grantee) shall
be reimbursed for expenses that would have
been paid by the Federal Government during

6503(d) of title 31, United States Code; and
(3) the State (or such other grantee) may
use funds available to the State (or the
grantee) under such Federal program to re-
imburse such State (or the grantee), to-
gether with interest thereon calculated
under section 6503(d) of title 31, United
States Code.
(b) For purposes of this section, the term
‘‘State’’ and the term ‘‘grantee’’, including
United States territories and possessions,

plies with respect to the period of a lapse in

ber 22, 2018, and ending on the date of enact-
ment of this joint resolution with respect to

the Department of Homeland Security
which, but for such lapse in appropriations,
would have paid, or made reimbursement re-
lating to, any of the expenses referred to in
this section with respect to the program in-
volved. Payments and reimbursements under
this authority shall be made only to the ex-
tent and in amounts provided in advance in
appropriations Acts.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
joint resolution shall be debatable for 1
hour, equally divided and controlled by
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Appropria-
tions or their respective designees.
The gentlewoman from California
(Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr.
FLEISCHMANN) each will control 30 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and insert
extraneous material on H.J. Res. 31,
currently under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, today, we are consid-
ering a continuing resolution to reopen
the Department of Homeland Security
after a funding lapse that is now 33
days and counting.
This bill simply extends 2018 funding
until February 28, with no new funding
anomalies.
The only new provisions in the CR
authorize the Department to provide
backpay to reimburse personnel and
State or other Federal grantees, con-
sistent with prior precedent following a
lapse in appropriations.
Mr. Speaker, there are only two ap-
proaches to take: either we reopen the
Department and the rest of the Federal
Government without conditions, or we
continue to use Federal workers and
everyone who depends on them as bar-
gaining chips in funding negotiations.
It seems to me the choice is straight-
forward.
I hope my friends on the other side of
the aisle will reconsider the necessity
of opening up the government and pay-
ing Federal employees without any
preconditions.
There have been a number of funding
lapses over the last few decades, all ill-
considered, all harmful to our country,
our economy, and our Federal work-
force.
History has shown that the American
people do not approve of using the Fed-
eral Government and workforce as
pawns in a legislative chess game. The
side that has tried to use the shutdown
as leverage in a negotiation has rou-
tinely failed, and polling shows that
this recent iteration of the shutdown is
no exception.
I know my friends on the other side
of the aisle have criticized the consid-
eration of clean CRs on the basis that
the Senate will not pass them and the
President will not sign them.
Mr. Speaker, to my friends on the
other side of the aisle, I would say
that, in order to change that, reopen
the Department of Homeland Security
by having every member of the minor-
ity party support this CR.
This possibly could help change the
thinking of the Senate majority when
it votes on reopening the entire gov-
ernment later today and perhaps even
change the thinking of the President.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I rise today in very strong oppo-
sition to the joint resolution.
Before I do that, Mr. Speaker, I wish
to thank our full ranking member, Ms.
GRANGER from Texas, my dear friend
and colleague, for allowing me to chair
this important subcommittee and for
allowing me to manage this time
today.
Mr. Speaker, I also would like to ac-
knowledge my friend and colleague
from the other side of the aisle, Ms.
ROYBAL-ALLARD, who I look forward to
working with over the next 2 years, she
in her capacity of chair of the Home-
land Security Appropriations Sub-
committee and me in my role as rank-
ing member, the highest member of the
Republican Party on that sub-
committee.
Mr. Speaker, I also see my friend,
Mrs. LOWEY from New York, the full
chairman, as well.
Mr. Speaker, how did we get here?
The fiscal year that the government
operates on started in September. It
runs from September to September, so
it started in the 115th Congress.
The Appropriations Committee, of
which I am very proud and thankful to
be a member, is a very special com-
mittee. For those who are watching us
now, I would offer, and I have said time
and time again, the Appropriations
Committee is something special.
b 0915
I am the only Member on the Appro-
priations Committee from my great
State of Tennessee. And I admire every
Member in this House and the positions
and the committees they serve on, but
the Appropriations Committee is a
problem-solving committee. It is a
committee that funds things, funds the
government on the discretionary side,
including Homeland Security.
During the course of the debate dur-
ing this long and arduous shutdown—
and let me say this: To the men and
women who are working all across this
Nation without pay, thank you. I sym-
pathize with you—not empathize, but
sympathize. This is wrong.
About 24 percent of the government
is shut down, and that is never a good
situation for us to be in as a nation;
and that is why we must come up with
a cure that will work, something that
will pass the House, something that
will pass the other Chamber.
And I add, today, as we debate this
bill and as I oppose this bill, in the
other Chamber, the United States Sen-
ate is debating bills. I would submit
that the solution could and should
come from the United States House of
Representatives, and that solution is
plain and simple.
The American people want and de-
serve border security. The American
people want and desire a barrier. Call it
a wall. Call it a fence. It is something
that the American people want. It has
been proven, whether in San Diego, El
Paso, or other jurisdictions, that these
walls do work.
But regardless where we stand on
that issue, I support the President’s po-
sition. The President has made it very
clear that he is not going to sign a bill
that does not include border security
with a wall, or an analogous vehicle to
a wall.
So if we keep coming back to the
table, even with the best intentions,
even with the best passions, even with
the best hopes to help get the govern-
ment open and running again and pro-
tect our borders—and I do believe
Members on both sides of this aisle and
in the other Chamber and, of course, in
the White House want border security,
want our country kept safe. The hu-
manitarian crisis is outrageous.
Women and children are being abused.
Drugs are pouring in. But above all
else, we need to secure our southern
borders. We need to keep the American
people safe.
The cure lies in a compromise. The
cure ought to come from this body and
if our friends in the majority would see
fit to put a sufficient number on the
table as part of a compromise.
Think of the boldness and courage of
our President who stood up and basi-
cally said: I will come up with a cure
for DACA, a solution on DACA.
That is courage. That is leadership.
That is boldness. And I think that is
what the American people deserve.
Let us, today, make a resolve that
this great House, this great people’s
House, which I believe is closest to the
people—we are elected every 2 years.
Think about it. The fiscal year, Mr.
Speaker, is going to end in September.
We are going to be back replaying this
same argument again, this same debate
again in just a few weeks. Come up
with a solution that we can all work
with. That means a wall. That means
other areas of border security. That
means full funding of the government.
Again, I close by saying to all of
those who are working without pay,
whether it is in our great Coast Guard,
the TSA, the contractors who are hurt-
ing, I will continue to work hard to
come to a compromise with my party,
with my colleagues, to come to a con-
clusion to this national nightmare.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself 1 minute.
I would just like to point out to the
minority that there are billions of dol-
lars in border security in this con-
tinuing resolution, and I agree that we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1178 January 24, 2019
need to open up the government. And
while the President refuses to do so,
our homeland is, every day, getting
more vulnerable to our lack of secu-
rity. I hope that the President recog-
nizes that and that he opens up the
government so that then we can have a
real discussion on border security.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.
LOWEY), the chairwoman of the full Ap-
propriations Committee.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, the
Trump shutdown is now in its 34th day.
Yesterday, the House passed six bills
to reopen most of the government, and
with this bill today, we can reopen the
entire government while providing
time to negotiate a full-year bill for
the Department of Homeland Security.
This continuing resolution would en-
sure that the Department of Homeland
Security is open, and its public serv-
ants, including Secret Service agents,
Transportation Security officers, Bor-
der Patrol, Customs officers, and the
brave men and women of the Coast
Guard are paid for their work.
According to The New York Times,
as many as 1 of every 10 Transportation
Security officers are not coming to
work. Frankly, they simply can’t af-
ford to. As a result, some of our busiest
airports are deploying backup and re-
serve workers. Other airports have
closed checkpoints and entire termi-
nals. Notwithstanding the long lines
for travelers, this reduction in staffing
puts our Transportation Security
workforce on the brink and could risk
national security.
Additionally, 41,000—41,000—Active-
Duty servicemembers and 2,100 civil-
ians in the Coast Guard are working
without pay.
No one should have to face the uncer-
tainty of not knowing when they will
get paid, especially the men and
women of our Armed Forces.
Each week of the Trump shutdown
costs the United States economy $1.2
billion. Instead of continuing down this
wasteful road, I urge my friends on the
other side of the aisle, reopen the gov-
ernment, pay our Federal workers, and
then we can work together in a bipar-
tisan way to determine the most effec-
tive border security. But we must open
the government.
Make no mistake—I want to make it
very clear—Democrats support smart
investments in our homeland security,
including increased infrastructure in-
vestments at our ports of entry, ad-
vanced technology to scan for contra-
band, new technology for detecting un-
authorized crossings. We can work to-
gether to meet these needs—there is no
question in my mind—because we have
worked together in a bipartisan way
for many years. If we sit down to-
gether, we can work out answers to
these questions that could be supported
by both sides of the aisle.
But, frankly, Mr. Speaker, until the
government is open, the President’s ac-
tions are hurting hardworking families
and putting our security and economy
at risk.
We are appropriators. We know how
to work together in a bipartisan way.
Frankly, it is not that difficult. The
facts are there. We have all gotten
many, many briefings on the best way
to secure our borders.
And, by the way, drugs have been
mentioned. The facts are that 90 per-
cent of the drugs are coming through
at the ports of entry.
We can work this out. But to keep
the government closed and to see thou-
sands of people suffering, not being
able to support their families, is just
unconscionable.
So let’s open the government. Let’s
sit down. Let’s get to work. Let’s re-
solve this now.
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, at
this time, I yield as much time as she
may wish to consume to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER), the
ranking member on the full Appropria-
tions Committee.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in opposition to H.J. Res. 31.
Mr. Speaker, we have a true humani-
tarian and security crisis on our south-
ern border. In the month of December
alone, Border Patrol agents appre-
hended more than 50,000 individuals on
our southern border. Of those, a record-
breaking 27,518 were family units; near-
ly 5,000 of them were unaccompanied
children.
Due in part to the treacherous jour-
ney, Border Patrol refers approxi-
mately 50 individuals a day for medical
treatment. In 1 week alone, at the end
of December, they referred 451 people
to medical providers for treatment; of
those, 259 were children. Seven out of
ten people are victims of violence on
their journey to the southern border; 31
percent of women are sexually as-
saulted.
There has been a significant increase
in drugs like methamphetamine, her-
oin, and fentanyl coming across the
border. Unfortunately, this is a crisis
partly of our own making. For years,
Members on both sides of the aisle have
warned against the growing threats
posed by our failure to enforce and re-
form our Nation’s immigration laws.
Just this week, Majority Leader STENY
HOYER said:
We want border security. We want to make
sure that people who come into the United
States of America are authorized to do so,
and we know they come in. We don’t want
contraband. We don’t want drugs coming in.
We don’t want dangerous people coming into
the country. So we are for border security.
Given this, we would think that they
would be jumping at the chance to vote
for a bill that includes:
Provisional status for 3 years for
700,000 current DACA recipients, giving
them access to work permits, Social
Security numbers, and protection from
deportation;
Provisional status for 3 years for
300,000 immigrants whose current tem-
porary protected status is set to expire;
$805 million for technology, canines,
and personnel to help stop the flow of
illegal drugs, weapons, and other con-
traband;
$800 million in humanitarian assist-
ance, medical support, and new tem-
porary housing;
$782 million to hire an additional
2,750 border agents, law enforcement,
and staff;
$563 million to support our immigra-
tion court system, including hiring 75
new immigration judge teams to re-
duce the immigration court backlog of
800,000 cases.
All of this was included in the rea-
sonable compromise that President
Trump put forward over the weekend,
but that is not the bill we have before
us. Not only did House Democrats re-
ject this plan before they even heard
the details, the bill they put on the
floor today provides not one single re-
form for our broken immigration sys-
tem. All this bill does is extend the sta-
tus quo.
Mr. Speaker, I have been to the bor-
der more times than I can count. I have
talked to these families who are risk-
ing their lives and the lives of their
children to come here. I have heard the
stories of Americans whose family
members’ lives were cut short due to
drugs and bad actors, who seek to ex-
ploit our immigration system.
b 0930
We owe it to all of these families to
do something about this crisis, and I
call on my colleagues on the other side
of the aisle to end the political games.
It is past time for them to come to the
negotiating table and work to resolve
this crisis in a reasonable, meaningful
way, and I urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘no’’ on this measure.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself 30 seconds.
Mr. Speaker, for whatever reason,
there seems to be reluctance on the
part of the minority to accept the
facts. And the reality is, while there
has been an increase in drugs crossing
at the border, the vast majority of drug
interdictions have occurred at the
ports of entry, not between the ports of
entry.
In fiscal year 2018, only 3 percent of
all heroin was interdicted between the
ports, and 5.8 percent of the meth was
interdicted between the ports.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.
The remainder of the interdictions
were at the ports of entry along with a
small amount at CBP checkpoints
north of the ports of entry.
So this idea that somehow we need to
have this wall between the ports of
entry because of the fact that drugs are
coming through that area at large
numbers and contributing to the drug
problems that we have here, is abso-
lutely false.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR).
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want
to thank Chairwoman ROYBAL-ALLARD
for her leadership on the Homeland Se-
curity Subcommittee, and for her ideas

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1179
January 24, 2019
on how we secure the border. I also
want to thank the ranking member,
my friend from Tennessee; the full
committee ranking woman, KAY
GRANGER, for the work that she has
done; and our leader, Mrs. LOWEY, the
chairwoman of the full committee.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this
joint resolution to reopen the govern-
ment and the Department of Homeland
Security. As we have said all along, we
must first open up the government, and
we can negotiate. We have always done
that. We have always kept the govern-
ment open and then we negotiate. We
are doing this so the Federal employees
do not suffer.
It has been 34 days since the govern-
ment shutdown, far surpassing any
other previous record. That means that
it has been 34 days that 800,000 Federal
employees have not received pay.
I live at the border. I don’t just go
and visit the border. I drink the water.
I breathe the air. I talk to Border Pa-
trol agents almost every day. I have
talked to CBP officers every day. I talk
to TSA officers. I talk to other folks,
and they are doing absolutely critical
work to keep us safe, but not receiving
a salary.
Open up the government. Imagine
trying to patrol the border or keep air-
line passengers safe without receiving
a single dime for the last 34 days. You
might be concerned about not being
able to pay your mortgage, your car
payment, food, and medicine. Your
kids are going to school. That is what
is going through the heads of those
Federal employees at the border. I have
talked to them, and we need to make
sure that we open up the government.
The American public is ready for
President Trump to put an end to this
crippling shutdown. Let’s keep the
facts in mind. The President continues
to reject any sort of compromise. We
are ready. We are appropriators. We
can sit down and work this out. I know
we can. We have done it in the past.
What I want to make sure is that we
don’t hold the Federal employees hos-
tage for a 14th century solution to a
21st century problem that we are look-
ing at.
In Texas, we have natural barriers.
Look at this, in west Texas, you have
got probably over 100 feet of barriers up
there. These are the natural barriers.
Tell me how somebody is going to cross
this natural barrier that we have.
If you look at the southern part of
Texas, you have a river. Private prop-
erty rights are important. Tell me how
you are going to cross over this river.
Are you going to put a wall here and
cut off people from their property that
they have owned for so long? How are
you going to do this?
All I need is a $100 ladder to cross
that particular area, or you can dig
under with a tunnel.
Listen to the latest drug case in New
York. What are the bad guys saying
there? They can either go under
through a tunnel, or they can use a
catapult. They can use a ladder. They
can use other things.
We want to make sure that we secure
the border. I live on the border. I want
to make sure we secure the border, but
let’s do it the right way. Now, if you
want to stop people from coming in, re-
member, 67 percent of the people who
are here illegally, how do they come
here? Through a legal visa.
So even if you put up a wall, they are
going to fly over, they are going to
drive to a bridge, or they are going to
go ahead and come through on a ship.
Keep in mind, most of those visa
overstays, do you know where they are
from? Canada.
Now, I am not asking you to look at
the northern border to put up a wall,
but I am saying Canadians. Look at the
facts. So if you want to stop drugs, just
like the chairwoman said, DEA, CPB,
the National Drug Threat Assessment,
they will tell you that most drugs
come through ports of entry, either in
car compartments, in trunks, in trains,
or other ways.
So even if you put up a wall, they are
going to go in. What we do is, we have
got to make sure that we put canines
at our bridges, make sure we have
enough CBP officers, and make sure we
have X-ray machines.
Look at Laredo, my hometown. We
get 15,000 trailers a day. We need to put
technology there. We need to put ca-
nines there. We need to put in CBP offi-
cers to make sure that we work on se-
curing our border.
Everybody talks about a crisis. In
2001, we had about 1.6 million individ-
uals that Border Patrol stopped. Now it
is 398,000. Look at what happened. The
numbers have gone down.
And if you want to talk about safety,
our security, I will tell you that my
hometown of Laredo is about three or
four times safer than we are here in
Washington, D.C.; murder rates, as-
saults, rapes, name all of the violent
crimes, it is safer there.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I yield an additional 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Texas.
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, the
most dangerous thing that I do is leave
the border to come to Washington, D.C.
I am not talking about the politics. I
am talking about, it is more violent
here.
So what should we do? Let’s open up
the government. Let’s sit down, advo-
cate for 21st century solutions, tech-
nology, increase personnel. We are los-
ing more Border Patrol. What do we
do? What does the administration do?
They put a $297 million contract out to
show them how to hire Border Patrol.
They just put out a $14.8 million pay-
ment to hire two—two—two Border Pa-
trol agents for almost $15 million.
Increase personnel, increase the in-
frastructure at our ports of entry, and
increase immigration judges. We have
been increasing immigration judges for
the last 3 years. This is nothing new.
We have been doing that.
Again, one of the most important
things, do we play defense on the 1-
yard line, where we spend $18 billion at
the U.S. border? Or do we play defense
on the 20-yard line, which is working
with the southern part of Mexico,
where we put $80 million a couple of
years ago? And what happened? They
started stopping 220,000 individuals a
year, a lot of people who are coming in,
and putting money in Central America,
which we have done before, to do that.
So, again, given the facts, I just call
upon our friends: open up the govern-
ment; let’s negotiate. We are appropri-
ators. I feel very confident if we open
up the government and we sit down, we
will find a solution.
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT).
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing.
Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to
speak in opposition to the majority’s
temporary funding bill for the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. However,
our crisis that we are at at this point
and at our border is not temporary, and
it continues to grow during this gov-
ernment shutdown.
I am not sure why my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle will expect a
different outcome today when the real
solution, as we all know, starts when
everyone sits around the negotiating
table.
The people elected the President and
they elected each of us. They elected
each of us to do our job, and this is a
serious job. Legislating is governing;
not putting bills on the floor of the
House that we know the President will
veto. He has continued to say that he
will veto this legislation, and we know
what the outcome will be.
I think all of the political points
have been made here this morning, and
I believe that it is time that we put
partisanship aside to try to work to-
gether to try to find a solution.
Instead of using the words ‘‘coming
together to compromise,’’ I think we
should use better words to say, ‘‘We
need to find common ground.’’
Just saying ‘‘no’’ to the physical in-
frastructure is not really a negotiating
position. This House yesterday had the
opportunity to vote to pay Federal
workers who have missed their pay-
checks, and it is disappointing that to-
gether, as a Congress, we couldn’t come
together for the needs of these public
servants.
We must put this political games-
manship aside and seek to work to-
gether to find some common ground. I
think that is where the solution lies.
The solution is really simple. One
side does not win at the expense of the
other. Instead, what we need to do is
find a way where each side cannot put
our individual parties’ interest before
the needs of the country and the people
who serve this country.
So this morning as we debate this
legislation and continue to have this
legislation before us, I would urge my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle—
VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:08 Jan 25, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K24JA7.008 H24JAPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1180 January 24, 2019
and let me say that, both sides of the
aisle, Democrats and Republicans—to
reject the proposal so that we can get
back to some serious business of being
a legislative body.
Let’s show the American people that
we deserve the trust that they placed
in us when they sent us to serve in this
House of Representatives.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for her years of service, ap-
pointed service, recognized service, for
we have gone to the southern border
many times.
I am a resident of the southern bor-
der. I am committed to the people of
the southern border, as I am to the
people of the United States, and most
importantly, to the heroic workers who
work for the Federal Government.
First, let me say that any regular
order of business of this House should
be the opening of the government and
paying the workers now.
I have been alongside of every aspect
of the southern border, every State, in-
cluding California, New Mexico, Ari-
zona, and Texas. I have been to every
part of the southern border. I have seen
the terrain. I have gone up to the Rio
Grande and on the Rio Grande several
times. I have seen it at its fullest and
I have seen it at its most narrow.
I have seen tunnels. I have seen the
San Diego wall, if you will. I have seen
the steel fencing. I have spoken to Bor-
der Patrol agents alongside of the bor-
der.
The tragedy of young Felipe, who
passed away; I went to the part where
he walked up with his father and they
presented themselves to the Border Pa-
trol.
My colleagues, including the gentle
chairwoman, have likewise, walked
with me or been to the border many
times. They have solutions. So regular
order now seems to be a straw man. We
are placing on the floor of the House a
bill that will open the government
until February 28, but it will fund the
Department of Homeland Security.
May I say those words again? Home-
land Security.
We are sitting here today, and we are
not considering that our Homeland Se-
curity Department, one of the largest—
I believe second to Department of De-
fense, rightly so, because it is home-
land security—which I have had the
privilege of serving since the heinous
terrorist act of 9/11. I have never given
up this committee because it is close to
my heart. It means the protection of
the American people day by day that
they look to now. Post-9/11, we have a
Homeland Security Department.
b 0945
All of the leaders of that department
whom I have worked with, most re-
cently Secretary Kelly, formerly the
chief of staff of this White House, and
Jeh Johnson, have said in a letter:
Open the government.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an
additional 2 minutes.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker,
you will begin to see the unraveling. It
is unraveling.
TSA officers make $28,000. Every one
of you are going to see them going out
and coming back in. You are counting
on air traffic controllers to keep the
planes aloft. You are counting on pilots
and flight attendants to be there pur-
suant to the aviation system.
I have been hearing pilots and air-
lines talking about putting pilots on
layoff, if you will, because they are
frightened about the planes, and they
may have to shut down some of the
routes.
This is a ripple effect. The Smithso-
nian system is crumbling, $4 million.
They cannot afford one more day.
But I want to get back to our TSOs
and all of those line officers, the DEAs,
the ATFs, the FBIs under the DOJ are
not funded even though essential and
working. So why not take this bill that
covers Secret Service?
I hope the President’s acquiescence
and calm tweet announcement ac-
knowledging that there cannot be a
State of the Union when the govern-
ment is in collapse and there is no
state of a Union and that we will not
have one, sadly, because we do work to-
gether, I am saying to my good friends:
Pass the bill.
Mr. Speaker, I say to my good friends
on this side of the aisle, Republicans:
You are going to vote ‘‘no’’ on a home-
land security bill on the pretense of
regular business, the lives of TSOs. One
young TSO had to send her newborn
baby to her mother because she could
not afford to take care of that child.
They don’t have gas money. They are
not allowed to take enormous gifts.
Every time I travel, there they are,
the frontline people of this government
in the system that is most attractive
to terrorists: airplanes. They have
never moved away from that.
So I am asking my colleagues to real-
ize the importance of this bill that will
fund reopening the government, the
Department of Homeland Security, al-
lowing these employees to be paid and
begin us on the process of opening gov-
ernment and paying our workers.
God help us.
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Members on both sides of the aisle
can clearly show that today has been a
day of speeches, of passion, and of good
faith beliefs on both sides of the aisle.
I want the American people to know
that the people making these argu-
ments on both sides of the aisle have
bona fide ideas about how to get the
government open, how to keep us safe,
and how to move forward from this
very difficult position.
I was an attorney for 24 years in my
prior profession, and in my closing ar-
guments, oftentimes I would point to
the facts that were most beneficial to
my case and to my client. But there
was a vehicle that came up while I was
practicing; it was called mediation.
Mediation was a way that the parties
could come to the table and all get
something and all give something in
return.
We have heard the same broken cure
come from the majority since they be-
came the majority. That cure—albeit
in their view, their version of how to
move forward—will not work. The
practical constraints will require an
agreement that the House, the Senate,
and the White House all can agree on.
That is the practical reality.
We agree that the hardworking men
and women of the Coast Guard, TSA,
and contractors are suffering, and we
have got to stop that suffering. But
when we know that the vote today—
which I will oppose with my vote on be-
half of my constituents. When we know
that that will not work, then we have
got to come back to the table with
something that will work.
To continue to press for something
that will not reopen the government
and will not get our task done—and,
again, I stress the fact that we are
going to end this fiscal year in Sep-
tember of this year. In a few short
weeks, when we move past this crisis,
we are going to, in our respective sub-
committees—and there are 12 on the
great Appropriations Committee, in-
cluding this great Subcommittee on
Homeland Security. Ms. ROYBAL-
ALLARD and I will be debating this
again.
Mr. Speaker, I thank her for her hard
work in these difficult times. This is
fraying on me, this is fraying on our
friends in the majority, and this is
fraying on our staffs and the American
people. But the solution is clear: Give
us—give the American people—funds
for a border wall as part of an overall
compromise to get border security, to
get the government open, and, yes, to
look at other ways to keep our south-
ern border and the American people
safe.
So my ‘‘no’’ vote today is not a ‘‘no’’
vote just to say no. My ‘‘no’’ vote
today is a statement to say to our
friends in the majority, as well-inten-
tioned as they may be—and I can stress
to my colleagues that we on the minor-
ity side are well intentioned. It is not
about good faith or bad faith; it is
about bona fide differences.
The American people elect us to lead.
Our great Republic is not an easy way
to govern, but, Mr. Speaker, I would
submit it is the best way to govern. I
know that it is hard right now for some
people not getting a paycheck to un-
derstand, but in our great Republic, it
takes two Houses of Congress. It takes
an executive, the President, and, yes, it
takes the Supreme Court as well.
So, Mr. Speaker, I will close in oppo-
sition. I will close with the best inten-
tions, and I just implore and I plead

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1181
January 24, 2019
with my friends in the majority: Put
something on the table that will fund
border security, that will give us a
wall, that will give us a barrier where
it works, and we will open the govern-
ment and keep the American people
safe.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, let me just first say
that it is very disappointing to hear
from the minority that the first pri-
ority is not to stop the suffering of our
Federal workers by opening up the gov-
ernment.
It is also unfortunate that the Presi-
dent has created such ill will around
border security, and border barriers in
particular. He has truly poisoned the
well on this issue and made it much
more difficult for Congress to find com-
mon ground. As a result, our Federal
workers are suffering, and our home-
land is becoming less safe.
Mr. Speaker, it is time to end the
shutdown. This morning, we can begin
the process by voting to reopen the De-
partment of Homeland Security, and
then we can continue to fulfill our re-
sponsibility by finishing our work on
the full-year 2019 funding bill for the
Department so that those who protect
our homeland can be paid as they con-
tinue their critical mission of pro-
tecting our homeland.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 61, the
previous question is ordered on the
joint resolution.
The question is on the engrossment
and third reading of the joint resolu-
tion.
The joint resolution was ordered to
be engrossed and read a third time, and
was read the third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I have a
motion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentlewoman opposed to the joint reso-
lution?
Ms. GRANGER. I am, in its current
form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Ms. Granger moves to recommit the joint
resolution H.J. Res. 31 to the Committee on
Appropriations with instructions to report
the same back to the House forthwith with
the following amendment:
Page 2, beginning on line 10, strike ‘‘Feb-
ruary 28, 2019’’ and insert ‘‘January 24, 2019’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
Texas is recognized for 5 minutes in
support of her motion.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, my mo-
tion amends the date of the continuing
resolution to January 24. My motion
will ensure that Homeland Security
employees will get the pay they de-
serve, consistent with the Government
Employee Fair Treatment Act that was
enacted last week.
Last week and yesterday, I offered
motions very similar to this one to im-
mediately pay the hardworking Fed-
eral employees affected by this shut-
down. Many of these people are on the
front lines protecting our Nation. They
shouldn’t suffer because of this unnec-
essary shutdown, and they don’t have
to any longer if Members would sup-
port this motion.
Last week, six Democrats voted for
my motion, and yesterday, 10 did.
Today, I call on all members of the ma-
jority party to agree with me that we
should provide Homeland Security em-
ployees the backpay they deserve and
join me in voting for this measure.
These employees have bills to pay
and families to support. This motion
will ensure that they are able to do
that immediately while we continue
working toward a permanent solution
that will reopen the government. The
homeland security staff protecting the
Nation should not be harmed because
some of my colleagues refuse to nego-
tiate.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the motion, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I rise in opposition to the motion to re-
commit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Let’s be
clear about what this motion would do:
It would continue the shutdown of
the Department of Homeland Security,
which means that workers would not
be in the office tomorrow to be able to
process the checks;
It would continue the shutdown of
the Transportation Security Adminis-
tration;
It would continue to make the brave
men and women of the Coast Guard and
Secret Service work without any cer-
tainty about their next paycheck.
A vote for this motion is a vote to
continue the Trump shutdown and a
vote against our Nation’s security.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in
the strongest possible terms to oppose
the motion to recommit, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, on that
I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair
declares the House in recess subject to
the call of the Chair.

utes a.m.), the House stood in recess.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
HOYER), my friend and the majority
leader of the House, for the purpose of
inquiring as to the schedule for next
week.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
SCALISE) for yielding the time.
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House
will meet at noon for morning-hour de-
bate. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the
VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:38 Jan 25, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24JA7.005 H24JAPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1184 January 24, 2019
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-
hour debate and noon for legislative
business. On Thursday, the House will
meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business,
with last votes no later than 3 p.m.
We will consider several bills under
suspension of the rules. The complete
list of suspensions will be announced
by the close of business tomorrow.
Members are advised that additional
legislative items are possible, includ-
ing additional legislation related to fis-
cal year 2019 appropriations.
I want to make it clear to Members
that when we leave today or tomorrow,
we will leave with the notice to Mem-
bers that they are subject to being
asked to come back Saturday, Sunday,
Monday morning, or any day there-
after, if there is a possibility of open-
ing up the Government of the United
States, so that it can serve the Amer-
ican people.
Mr. SCALISE. As we, Mr. Speaker,
work to reopen the government and to
secure the border, clearly, there has
been a divide on the other side. We
were trying to get some kind of agree-
ment on how much the majority is
willing to work with us on, to put an
offer on the table.
If you look, Mr. Speaker, last week
on Saturday, the President of the
United States addressed the Nation and
laid out a new proposal. And, Mr.
Speaker, what the President laid out
was not only a proposal that reopens
the government and secures the border,
but also offered the suggestion that
DACA could be a part of this negotia-
tion, at least to start working on some
kind of solution on DACA.
In the past, Mr. Speaker, we were
just talking about the request from the
Department of Homeland Security, the
$5.7 billion that was requested by the
people who risk their lives to keep our
country safe. Their request, Mr. Speak-
er, was that is how much it was going
to cost to secure the border.
So far, we have not seen a single
counteroffer from the majority. In fact,
when the President spoke to the Na-
tion at 4:07 p.m., before the President
even walked to the microphone at 4:07
p.m., at 4 p.m., the Speaker of the
House had already put out a statement
opposing the plan that hadn’t even
been presented.
Mr. Speaker, what I would like to
ask the majority leader is, if we are
trying to get a resolution and if the
President continues to try to lay out
alternatives, if the President’s latest
alternative wasn’t even offered until
4:07 p.m., why did the Speaker of the
House already reject it before it was
even presented? Is there an actual de-
sire to work together to solve the prob-
lem, or is the answer going to continue
to be no alternative, no alternative?
At some point, we have to get an
agreement on how to solve this prob-
lem.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, let me make very clear
that which ought to be very clear: We
believe the President of the United
States, with the aiding and abetting of
the majority leader of the United
States Senate, has taken the Govern-
ment of the United States hostage, and
the President of the United States is
asking for ransom, and that ransom is
to accept his policy or go home and
stay shut down.
I will tell the gentleman, Mr. Speak-
er, that I have been in this body for a
long time. I am in my fourth decade. I
have never supported shutting down
the Government of the United States.
Now, the gentleman may point out
that I have voted from time to time
against bills that would have opened it
up because of things that were in the
bills and these bills passed the House of
Representatives when you were in
charge. They did not pass the Senate,
of course.
b 1100
I believe that shutting down the peo-
ple’s government is an unacceptable—
unacceptable—tactic in a democracy
when one is discussing differences that
need to be resolved. Unacceptable.
Furthermore, as I said on the floor
the other day, Mr. Speaker, I can find
no free government in the world that
shuts itself down, other than the
United States of America. Now, we
have a relatively unique system of gov-
ernment.
But I will tell my friend that we are
for border security. We have supported
bills that affected border security. Dur-
ing our tenure, there was more border
security fencing, I will tell the gen-
tleman, constructed than when they
had been in charge over the last 8
years. Look at the record.
But the issue is, we are not going to
negotiate at the point of a gun, which
is shutting down the Government of
the United States, affecting 800,000 of
our employees.
Some of you say: I run a business. I
am a businessman.
Well, if you are a car company, or
you are a real estate company, or you
are a contractor, or whatever you may
do, can you tell your employees: I am
going to have you work, but by the
way, I am not going to pay you.
Mr. Speaker, we want to negotiate.
We want to get this resolved, but we
are not going to pretend this is busi-
ness as usual. This is the longest shut-
down in history, and the other side has
consistently voted against every bill
that we have offered to open up govern-
ment.
Now, the other side offered a bill
where they want to pay employees
while they don’t work. I voted against
that. I think the taxpayer deserves to
have his employees or her employees
working, and, yes, he should pay them
and she should pay them for working,
not some stopgap measure to pretend
that somehow we are lessening the con-
sequences of a shutdown, in light of a
consistent, overwhelming vote on the
other side of the aisle to keep govern-
ment shut down.
I tell my friend, he voted against
Boehner, when he was the Speaker of
the House, requesting to open up the
government. Maybe he believes, Mr.
Speaker, that shutting down the gov-
ernment is good policy, good practice,
the way to treat your employees. I em-
phatically reject such a premise.
When the gentleman asked me if will
we negotiate, I am pretty proud of my
reputation, having negotiated with
George H.W. Bush a major piece of leg-
islation that was very controversial,
the Americans with Disabilities Act,
negotiating in league with ROY BLUNT,
one of the gentleman’s predecessors on
his side of the aisle; and Jay Rocke-
feller and Senator Kit Bond from Mis-
souri to get FISA, the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act, which was a
very controversial issue, resolved, with
Democratic and Republican support,
and President George W. Bush signed
that bill.
So anybody who knows my reputa-
tion knows that I am prepared to sit
down and come to agreement, because
that is what you need to do in a democ-
racy. I won’t get everything I want;
you won’t get everything you want.
But the fact of the matter is, as long
as government is shut down, we are not
going to have business as usual.
I remind the gentleman that his side
was in charge last year and went 11
months and 20 days and didn’t bring a
Homeland Security bill to the floor of
this House—11 months and 20 days. It
was in the waning 10 days of the year
when his majority brought a bill to the
floor that they knew wouldn’t pass the
Senate.
We have passed Senate bills that
would open up the government. We
have sent simple CRs with no con-
troversy to them that would have
opened up the government. We have
sent 10 different bills, 11 different bills.
The 12th lost on suspension, because
their side voted against it.
So I tell my friend, I am prepared to
negotiate. I am prepared to negotiate
in good faith. I will tell the gentleman,
the Speaker of this House is prepared
to do the same, and our Members are
prepared to do the same.
There are significant, strong dif-
ferences. We differ on whether the wall
is an effective way to keep the border
secure. But we agree on a number of
other things.
When the gentleman and I were down
at the White House, for instance, the
magnetic resonance of trucks and vehi-
cles that are carrying contraband,
drugs, guns, and other material that we
don’t want to come into the United
States, we can agree on that. We can
agree on much, I think, of border secu-
rity.
That was a long answer to the gentle-
man’s question, but until we open up
government, it is not going to be busi-
ness as usual, until we open up govern-
ment and put those 800,000 people back
to work. I represent 62,000 of them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1185
January 24, 2019
Now, not all of them are laid off, be-
cause we funded some portions of gov-
ernment. But a significant number of
them are, and they are hurting.
A TSA agent comes in at $28,000 per
year. We make substantially more than
that, and they are living paycheck to
paycheck. Tomorrow, they are not
going to get a paycheck. But they have
been told by their government they
have to work, and because they are
conscientious, patriotic Americans,
they are working. But you can’t expect
them to work much longer. We can’t
expect people to work when they are
not getting paid, when they are not
getting respected, when they are not
getting treated as we would want to be
treated ourselves.
So I say to the gentleman, in answer
to his question, we are prepared to dis-
cuss and negotiate and compromise,
but not in the face of this shutdown.
I would hope that it would end. It is
the wrong policy. It is a cruel policy. It
is hurting America. It is hurting our
economy. It is hurting our reputation
around the world. And it is hurting our
people who work for us.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman uses terms like ‘‘hostages.’’
The gentleman uses terms like ‘‘ran-
som.’’ I was in those meetings in the
White House with the gentleman from
Maryland and the Speaker of the
House. In fact, in our third meeting—
by the way, in all three meetings, not
one time did the Speaker of the House
put any alternative on the table.
President Trump isn’t the one who
said: I need $5.7 billion to secure the
border.
Our experts, our experts at the De-
partment of Homeland Security, who
risk their lives to keep our country
safe, said it is going to take $5.7 billion
to secure the border.
We can all talk about border secu-
rity, Mr. Speaker. At some point, you
have to be willing to put the dollars be-
hind the rhetoric. So when the Depart-
ment, Mr. Speaker, says we need $5.7
billion, if your side thinks that there is
some lesser amount that it is going to
take to keep our country safe, then put
the amount of money on the table. So
far, the only offer that has been put on
the table by the Speaker of the House,
she said a dollar, and she laughed
about it, a dollar. That is the only offer
that has been put on the table. It is not
a joking matter, by the way. And a dol-
lar is not going to secure America’s
border. So what amount will the other
side agree to?
The President of the United States
looked at the Speaker and said: Okay,
I will tell you what, we disagree on a
lot of this, but I will agree to keep the
government open, even with the things
I disagree with, for the next 30 days, if,
at the end of that 30 days, you are will-
ing to negotiate with me on the wall
and the border security.
The Speaker of the House said no.
She said no to that offer from the
President. She wants to keep every-
body hostage. She wants to keep the
pay of workers hostage.
In fact, now the Speaker of the House
wants to keep the State of the Union
hostage. How ludicrous is that? George
Washington, in 1790, addressed a joint
session of Congress. They were meeting
in New York back then. George Wash-
ington addressed a joint session of Con-
gress.
This is a constitutional requirement
of the President. Historically, for gen-
erations now, every single year, for
generations—Republican Speaker,
Democrat Speaker, Republican Presi-
dent, Democrat President—the Speaker
of the House has invited the President
to give a State of the Union.
In fact, that agreement and that
offer went out on January 3. The
Speaker sent a letter to the President,
inviting him to come here in this
Chamber and address the State of the
Union next Tuesday, and the President
accepted that offer. And the Speaker of
the House this time, for the first time
in the history of our country, rescinded
the offer, took it back. She doesn’t
want the people in this country to hear
what the President has to say about
the security of this country.
Maybe, Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of
the House doesn’t want the country to
hear the President’s message, but do
you know what? The people of this
country want to hear the President’s
message and deserve that opportunity.
So who is holding whom hostage?
Look at some of the votes. We had a
vote today on the House floor to pay
everybody, to pay everybody who has
worked or who has been furloughed.
Those people who are securing our bor-
der today without pay, they ought to
get paid. We had a vote on the House
floor, and we almost got there: 200–214.
Mr. Speaker, every Republican voted
yes; 13 Democrats voted yes. Last
week, only six Democrats voted yes.
The good news is, Mr. Speaker, a
growing number of Democrats are rec-
ognizing they have to be willing to
work to solve this problem and pay
people who have worked. So we have
had those votes on the House floor.
The gentleman talks about opening
government. The gentleman talks
about bills they have brought to the
House floor that we voted against. The
gentleman talks about the Senate bills
that were passed. At the beginning, the
first week of this new majority, when
they brought a bill to the floor to fund
what was so-called, or presented as, the
Senate bills, some of those bills had
passed the Senate, Mr. Speaker, but
not all of them. In fact, one of those
bills would not have passed the Senate
because it would have allowed taxpayer
funding to go to foreign government
entities that provide abortion.
So let’s get this right, Mr. Speaker,
and let the RECORD reflect that the
other side was willing to bring a bill to
the floor a few weeks ago that allows
taxpayer money to go to fund abortion
in foreign countries, but they wouldn’t
put a dime of money in that bill to se-
cure America’s border. There was not a
dime of money from the President’s re-
quest to secure America’s border, but
taxpayer money went to fund abortions
in foreign countries. That was in that
bill.
Sure, I voted no on that, because
those are not the values of this coun-
try. Let’s be serious about this.
Mr. Speaker, if we want to talk about
what it will take to resolve it, I think
the gentleman from Maryland and I
could come to an agreement. So far, for
whatever reason, the Speaker has been
unwilling to put a counteroffer on the
table.
When you have a negotiation, when
two sides are apart—frankly, I don’t
know why we are apart on this. It is
not the President’s number. The $5.7
billion request is from the people who
are risking their lives to keep our
country safe. If they say that is what
they need, we ought to take them at
their word.
And if we disagree with them, if we
disagree, Mr. Speaker, then at least
show what their offer is, what their
amount of money is, and put that on
the table and back it up with some-
thing.
If they say the wall is the issue,
maybe it is personal, maybe it is be-
cause President Trump wanted it. Back
in 2006, CHUCK SCHUMER voted for the
Secure Fence Act, which would have
authorized $50-plus billion to build
fencing, which, in essence, is a lot of
what the Department is asking for
today. If he was authorizing $50 bil-
lion—by the way, they didn’t put any
money behind it.
Again, it is always good to give the
Fourth of July speech and say you are
for something. Unless you are willing
to put the money behind it, you are not
there.
So he said $50 billion was okay for
fencing, but, today, he is not willing to
put a dollar behind, in essence, fencing,
or whatever you want to call it.
The President said he is willing to
negotiate and let you ban a cement
wall. The President said he is willing
to do that. Right now, the experts are
saying steel slats are the best ap-
proach.
The majority leader himself, just a
few days ago, said, ‘‘Physical barriers
are part of the solution.’’ I think we
are making headway. The majority
leader agrees that physical barriers are
part of the solution, maybe because the
Speaker is saying that walls are im-
moral. In some strange way, people
who build a house, you could build the
strongest door in the world—and I
agree, the gentleman from Maryland
and I agree on enhancing port security,
the points of entry.
We have points of entry all around
our country. If you want to come here
and seek asylum, if you want to come
here and just be a part of the American
Dream, like more than a million people
a year who we let in, we have that. And
we need to bulk that up. There is a lot
more we can do with technology there.
But you don’t put a door in your
house and then leave the windows

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1186 January 24, 2019
open. Who would do that? Who would
call that security of your house?
What the President is saying is, we
have more than 500 miles of area in our
country that is not secure. So you have
a big door, and we are going to
strengthen the door. But if you are
going to leave 500 miles wide open, you
are going to wonder why people are
coming in illegally.
If we are for border security, it is
going to take something to actually
back that up. I would ask the gen-
tleman: What amount is the majority
willing to put on the table for real bor-
der security, which includes a physical
barrier? And I quote the gentleman
again: ‘‘Physical barriers are part of
the solution.’’
b 1115
And I agree with the gentleman from
Maryland on that. But I guess maybe
the question I have is: The experts
have told us it is going to cost $5.7 bil-
lion to build that physical barrier. How
much of that $5.7 billion is the gen-
tleman willing to support?
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for his comments.
The gentleman, of course, just voted
against funding the Department of
Homeland Security, as did his col-
leagues.
The gentleman proudly said that all
of his colleagues—and not all of his col-
leagues voted against it—but he voted
against opening up the Department of
Homeland Security. He voted against
paying the personnel in Department of
Homeland Security. Yet, he cites them
as experts who have given us advice,
and why don’t we follow that advice.
But, Mr. Speaker, the minority party
doesn’t have enough respect for them
to open up the government, open up
the Department of Homeland Security,
pay the people who are protecting our
border, pay the people who are proc-
essing paperwork for those border secu-
rity guards, pay the people who are an-
swering the phones, pay the people
whom we ask to protect our borders,
and then laments that somehow we are
not coming up with a number.
Open up this government, Mr. Speak-
er.
And, yes, I used the word, ‘‘hostage’’;
and, yes, I used the word, ‘‘ransom.’’
And, yes, I believe there are two peo-
ple, and a lot of complicit people, with
this government being shut down and
with the pain and suffering that we are
imposing on our employees. Anybody
who thinks Democrats are responsible
for that doesn’t know what is hap-
pening.
I am very concerned about the Presi-
dent being able to communicate with
the American people. The historic,
greatest tweeter of all time. You can’t
get away from hearing what the Presi-
dent has to say, every morning, every
afternoon, and every evening. He has
plenty of time.
And, by the way, the President said:
Yes, I am not going to give the State of
the Union until the government is
open. He just said that, just a few
hours ago.
Open up this government.
And for anybody who watches the
votes on this floor, watched that we
voted unanimously to open up DHS; we
voted unanimously to open up the
other departments of government; we
voted unanimously to make sure that
the people are being served by their
government agencies.
And, Mr. Speaker, again, I under-
stand Mr. SCALISE and I have a dif-
ference. When the Speaker of the House
John Boehner brought a bill to the
floor when the government was shut
down to open it up, Mr. SCALISE voted
‘‘no’’; and the other person who voted
‘‘no’’ is Mr. Mulvaney, who is now the
chief of staff.
I get that. They think shutting down
the government is not a bad option to
try to force the other side to agree
with them or to pay their ransom.
Yes, I use those words. And, actually,
if either one of us adopts that as an ac-
ceptable alternative in the negotiation
process, this country is in real trou-
ble—real trouble.
And so we ought to open up the gov-
ernment, and then, yes, we can sit
down, and, yes, we will resolve this.
But my friend’s great angst—he did
not mention why it took them 11–2/3
months while they were in charge last
year. They didn’t offer a bill until they
were about to walk out the door and be
the minority. Mr. Speaker, 11 months
and 20 days, no Homeland Security bill
was brought to this floor. I don’t know
why. My supposition is they didn’t
have the votes, but I wasn’t counting
on their side.
Mr. Speaker, I have been to probably
37 or 38 States of the Union. Never was
the government shut down. This shut-
down is not only of historic length, it
is of historic irresponsibility and his-
toric danger to our country, to our peo-
ple, to our national security, and to
our economy.
Let’s vote to open up this govern-
ment, and then let’s resolve the dif-
ferences that we have in the way de-
mocracies resolve differences: by dis-
cussion, by debate, and by votes.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, reclaim-
ing my time, let’s reflect on why we
are here.
We are here because the President
said we have a difference of agreement
on parts of government. We negotiated
over the course of months to fund 75
percent of our government.
The good news, Mr. Speaker, is that
the vast majority of our government
has been funded, including our troops.
Our military are being paid. We were
able to come to an agreement there.
The bad news is, Mr. Speaker, we
were not able to come to an agreement
over the remaining 25 percent. And
people around the country, I am sure,
wonder: Why can’t they work it out?
And I think, Mr. Speaker, you just
saw a display of why this can’t be
worked out. Because, Mr. Speaker, the
President of the United States got a re-
quest from his Homeland Security offi-
cials, people who risk their lives to
keep our country safe. They said, Mr.
Speaker: It is going to take $5.7 billion
to give us the tools we need to secure
our border.
And I asked the gentleman just a mo-
ment ago, Mr. Speaker, once again,
how much are you willing to support if
you won’t support the $5.7 billion? The
entire time, not once did the gen-
tleman from Maryland give a number—
not once.
If the gentleman would give a num-
ber, I would yield, but there are a lot of
other things that he said that need to
be corrected that I want to also ad-
dress.
Is the gentleman willing to give a
number over $1, which is the Speaker’s
number? $5.7 billion, $1. Is he willing to
give some number more than $1 that
would secure the border?
Mr. Speaker, I yield if the gentleman
would give that answer.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, these CRs
carry forward the spending in 2018, the
CRs the gentleman voted against. They
have $1.6 billion in them. He voted
‘‘no.’’
And would the gentleman tell me
why he didn’t bring a bill to the floor
for 11 months and 20 days that would
have done what he says is such impor-
tant work to be done? Can he tell me
why he waited 11 months and 20 days to
bring a bill to the floor?
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I will be
happy to tell the gentleman.
I think the gentleman knows, one of
the dilemmas we have been facing with
negotiations is that the Senate has a
60-vote requirement. The Senate had
that 60-vote requirement back when
you all were in the majority last time.
When we were in the majority, they
had that 60-vote requirement as well.
When we were negotiating all of
those bills, all the bills that fund our
government, we were able to get an
agreement on 75 percent of government
funding. We had that negotiation with
the Senate. We can’t just negotiate
with ourselves.
As you see, you can pass bills in the
House and they go nowhere in the Sen-
ate. We brought a bill in December—
and, by the way, the gentleman from
Maryland said we didn’t have the
votes, that is why we didn’t do it. The
Speaker of the House went into the
Oval Office and told the President:
Your side can’t deliver the votes for
the $5.7 billion. She said that.
Well, guess what, Mr. Speaker. We
did deliver the votes for the $5.7 billion,
and we were able to do that all along,
but the Senate wasn’t there. And why
wasn’t the Senate there? The Senate
Republicans were willing to support
that, but Senate Democrats weren’t. It
is the same dilemma we are in today.
The Senate Democrats and House
Democrats have refused to negotiate
with the President.
I think the gentleman from Maryland
knows the legislative process. He has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1187
January 24, 2019
been here enough to know you can’t
just pass a bill out of the House, and
you can’t just pass a bill out of the
Senate. You have to reconcile the two
bills. And even then, you need a bill
that the President will sign.
So the legislative process has to play
out. It played out for 75 percent of the
government, and it is funded. We never
got that agreement on the remaining
amounts.
We proved to the Speaker and to the
President we could deliver the votes to
pass the bill to fund the $5.7 billion.
The problem has been that this major-
ity, the Democratic majority in the
House and the Democratic minority in
the Senate have refused to negotiate.
They have refused to put a dollar
amount.
If the gentleman is willing to start at
$1.3 billion—by the way, that $1.3 bil-
lion had strings attached, important
strings that limited our ability to ac-
tually secure the border. In those
strings, Mr. Speaker, they actually
told the President where he can and
can’t build wall.
So our security experts are saying,
for example, we need to build wall
around the Rio Grande. That is where a
lot of people are bringing drugs and
human trafficking across our country.
And yet law says you can’t build it
there. How ridiculous is that?
So, in our legislation that we passed,
we removed that limitation. Why
should we be micromanaging the ex-
perts who risk their lives and telling
them they can’t do the things it takes
to support the border? That was in our
bill.
Current law also prohibits what kind
of security, what kind of physical bar-
riers—to use the gentleman’s term—
can or can’t be used. And so our experts
say there are some physical barriers
that don’t work.
Why would you want to spend $1.3
billion of taxpayer money to build
things that won’t actually work when
you can spend the money to build
things that actually do work? And
again, these aren’t the President’s de-
signs. These are the experts who risk
their lives, who said: This is what we
need.
So, yes, Mr. Speaker, we weren’t able
to get an agreement with the Senate
over that 25 percent. We proved we
could put the votes together in the
House to do it. The Senate couldn’t
pass the bill. So, ultimately, there was
nothing that got to the President’s
desk on those remaining items, so the
President convened us.
The President got all the principals
together, Mr. Speaker, and in three dif-
ferent meetings in the White House,
not one time—not one time—was a sin-
gle dollar amount put on the table by
the Democrats in the room—not once.
So then you can look at other votes,
you can look at other plans.
So the President said: Well, if the
Speaker of the House won’t negotiate,
maybe I will bring in other Democrats.
And, by the way, it is a growing list
of Democrats who are starting to say
we need to address this problem.
I will read from the chairman of the
House Agriculture Committee, Mr.
COLLIN PETERSON, Democrat from Min-
nesota: ‘‘Give Trump the money. . . .
I’d give him the whole thing . . . and
put strings on it so you make sure he
puts the wall where it needs to be. Why
are we fighting over this? We’re going
to build that wall anyway, at some
time.’’
Representative ADAM SMITH, chair-
man of the House Armed Services Com-
mittee: ‘‘The wall is not in itself a bad
idea, it’s just—it’s been done.’’
Representative CHERI BUSTOS from Il-
linois: ‘‘If we have a partial wall, if we
have fencing, if we have technology
used to keep our borders safe, all of
that is fine . . . .’’
So we see a growing list of rank-and-
file Democrats, and even committee
chairmen, who are saying let’s just do
this, and yet the Speaker refuses to do
it.
So the President invited some mem-
bers of the Democratic majority in the
House to the White House. The first
meeting, Mr. Speaker, some of them
didn’t even show up. And we want to
talk about civility?
We are in a shutdown, and the Presi-
dent of the United States says: I want
to bring some Democrats in to see if we
can resolve this. Then they don’t even
show up. And maybe they were told not
to go.
So a few days later, the President in-
vites a different group, and in that
group we actually did have some Mem-
bers that went.
The gentleman from Maryland, that
day, was on a TV show, and he said—
when they were asked do those Demo-
crats who are going to the White House
have the authority to negotiate, the
majority leader of the House said they
do not have the authority to strike a
deal.
So now the Democratic majority is
telling other Democrats who want to
solve the problem and are going to the
White House to try to solve the prob-
lem, he is telling them they don’t have
the authority to solve the problem.
So if the gentleman from Maryland is
telling other Democrats they don’t
have the authority to strike a deal, I
would ask the gentleman: Who does
have the authority to strike a deal?
He is saying that physical borders
are part of the solution. The Speaker of
the House doesn’t necessarily share
that view, from the comments I have
heard from her.
But if the gentleman from Maryland
thinks physical borders are part of the
solution, other Democrats want to ne-
gotiate a solution, who is authorized?
Who does have the authority to strike
a deal?
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Maryland.
b 1130
Mr. HOYER. Let me first say that
Mr. SCALISE and his party over the last
8 years that they were in charge passed
bill after bill after bill after bill that
they knew without any doubt they had
no chance in the United States Sen-
ate—none, zero, zip. They passed them
for message. They knew that, we knew
that, and America knew that. So that
is not the reason they didn’t bring the
bill that they talk now so passionately
about to the floor for 11 months and 20
days. They only brought it as they
were going out the door.
Let me tell you what they rejected,
Mr. Speaker. They rejected a bill from
the United States Senate which would
have opened up government and paid
all 800,000 of the people who are now ei-
ther furloughed or asked to work with-
out pay. They rejected that bill that
passed overwhelmingly and unani-
mously on voice vote from the United
States Senate that the President of the
United States was said, by the Vice
President of the United States, to sup-
port.
But something happened during
those 24 hours as it came from the Sen-
ate to the House. A bill that passed the
Senate, they rejected that bill, the Re-
publicans in this House, and then they,
and only then, did they bring a bill
which they knew would not pass the
Senate. Talk about negotiation and
compromise, and you have done that
over and over and over, Mr. Speaker—
not you but the Republican majority.
Now, Mr. Speaker, let me tell you
who sent it over here: Senator MITCH
MCCONNELL of Kentucky, the Repub-
lican leader of the United States Sen-
ate.
Let me quote Senator MCCONNELL in
a CNN report:
In his strongest words to date, Senate GOP
leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Ken-
tucky, tried to quash talk that he would
allow another government shutdown if he be-
comes Senate majority leader next year.
What was his response? ‘‘ ‘Of course
not. Remember me? I am the guy that
gets us out of shutdowns,’ MCCONNELL
told CNN in an exclusive interview
Wednesday.
Then he went on to say: ‘‘ ‘It’s a
failed policy,’ he said of shutdowns.’’
Now, sadly, in league with the Re-
publican minority here in the House of
Representatives and the President of
the United States, he has done exactly
the opposite of what he said he would
do. He hasn’t opened up, he has shut
down government.
The minority whip is correct, Mr.
Speaker. We are not going to pretend
that this is business as usual as long as
we have 800,000 of our employees—some
working, some not—not being paid and
not being treated with respect because
it is a tactic that they have adopted.
And I tell my friend again: it must be
a tactic he believes in because he voted
against his own Republican Speaker
and the majority leader who is now the
Republican leader who voted and urged
Members: vote to open up this govern-
ment.
Now, he was not alone in that vote.
There were 143 other Republicans. Only

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1188 January 24, 2019
that is acceptable in a democratic gov-
ernment. We reject that emphatically
and proudly.
We have passed bill after bill after
bill after bill that would open up this
government, and Mr. SCALISE, Mr.
Speaker, and his colleagues have al-
most to a person—not always unani-
mously—rejected that effort.
So I tell my friend: open up the gov-
ernment and we will talk, but we are
not going to talk while you hold hos-
tage the employees of this govern-
ment—not all of them, but 800,000 of
them—who are worried about whether
they can put food on the table.
There are food lines. Our people at
food lines—public employees—do we
have no shame?
Do we have no moral commitment to
those whom we ask to work to protect
this country and to serve these people?
What is it that the President and his
party refuse to open up the govern-
ment?
This is historic. Never in the his-
tory—he talked about going back to
George Washington in 1799—has this
ever happened before that we kept the
government shut down. The longest be-
fore that, of course, was the Repub-
lican shutdown of 2013.
It is not a tactic I tell my friend that
we accept. We reject it emphatically,
and we are not going to subject our-
selves tomorrow to the same kind of
blackmail or the day after to the same
kind of blackmail or the day after that
to the same kind of blackmail.
I will tell my friend: we will have a
Democratic President at some point in
time. And he ought to reject this tactic
as well because it is bad for the govern-
ment. Much more importantly, it is
bad for the people of this country, the
economy of our country, and the na-
tional security of our country.
Mr. Speaker, I have nothing else to
say.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, once
again, we are in a government shut-
down. I could clearly argue that the
gentleman from Maryland voted to
shut the government down in Decem-
ber before we had hit an expiration of
funding. Before there was a shutdown,
we had a bill to fund government and
secure the border. My friend can say it
was dead on arrival in the Senate. The
reason it was dead on arrival in the
Senate is because Senate Democrats
refused to negotiate over securing the
border.
So here we are. We could talk about
2013. We are in 2019, and we are in the
middle of a government shutdown that
could end tomorrow. The majority just
voted to adjourn again. Literally—and
here is the quote my friend just said—
the gentleman from Maryland said:
‘‘We are not going to talk until the
government is open.’’
So during the shutdown, the gen-
tleman is not going to negotiate how
to get out of a shutdown.
The gentleman wonders why people
look and say: why can’t you figure it
out?
The President has offered idea after
idea, and eventually you are negoti-
ating against yourself when the other
side says: we are not going to talk
until we get everything we want.
Well, do you know what, Mr. Speak-
er? In divided government, Mr. Speak-
er, nobody gets everything they want,
but you have to start talking today.
The 800,000 people who are working or
not working and not getting pay-
checks—which, by the way, we voted
again today to pay all of them, we had
a vote on the House floor to pay all of
them, and we got 13 Democrats to vote
for that. Last week it was only six. A
growing number of Democrats are rec-
ognizing stop all this foolishness of
saying: we are not going to talk to you
when the President is trying to talk.
We are going to reject your offer before
you put it on the table. At 4 o’clock
Saturday the Speaker rejected an offer
that wasn’t even proposed until 4:07.
So to say: we are not going to talk
while we are in the shutdown, how do
we get out of the shutdown unless peo-
ple are talking?
I think the gentleman from Maryland
and I could solve this problem. He
quoted: Physical barriers are part of
the solution.
I agree with the gentleman from
Maryland on that. Unfortunately, the
Speaker of the House doesn’t agree
with that. So rank-and-file Democrats
who want to solve this problem are in-
vited to the White House, but told by
the Democrat leadership: you are not
authorized to negotiate.
So I ask the gentleman from Mary-
land: Who is authorized to negotiate?
And the gentleman from Maryland
says: we are not going to talk until the
government is back open.
But the government is not open be-
cause we are at an impasse, and the
way you solve an impasse is to talk.
You can’t say: ‘‘We are not going to
talk’’ and expect it just to solve itself
and expect the President just to keep
offering and offering and offering and
the Speaker of the House say: we are
not even going to let you come talk to
the country; we are not going to let
you have a State of the Union; my way
or the highway.
That is not how you solve this prob-
lem. You have to talk to solve this
problem. The country expects you to
talk to solve this problem.
It is divided government. Sure, we
are not going to agree on everything.
Our experts—it is not the Republican
Party saying $5.7 billion is what it
would cost to secure our border—it is
the experts who secure our border who
say it is going to cost $5.7 billion.
Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman dis-
agrees with that number, if he doesn’t
like the color of the wall or the style of
the slats and the steel, if he wants to
make it out of bamboo, I don’t know
what the gentleman’s offer is because
he has never put an offer on the table.
But at some point the gentleman has
to. He has to put a counteroffer on the
table if we are going to get out of this.
I want to get out of this. I voted mul-
tiple times to get out of it and to pay
people. The gentleman from Maryland
can show votes, and I can show votes.
Ultimately we need to talk to get an
agreement.
So I continue to stand ready, the
President stands ready; our minority
here in the House and our majority in
the Senate stands ready. But if only
one side is saying: ‘‘We are going to
talk,’’ and the other side says: ‘‘We are
not going to talk’’, that is not going to
resolve itself.
We have to talk if it is going to re-
solve itself, and, hopefully, Mr. Speak-
er, we do.
I stand ready, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Ms. FRANKEL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, this
week I met with south Floridians to
talk about the impact of the cruel
Trump shutdown, so many sad stories.
I learned about a TSA agent who just
came back from maternity leave who
had to send her baby to her mother in
Massachusetts because she didn’t have
the money for daycare or Pampers.
The air traffic controllers told me
that their stress level is so high now, it
is a danger to all of us. And I heard
from the service providers of victims of
domestic violence who are worried that
their shelters are about to close.
Now, Democrats, we support smart
border security, not an ineffective,
wasteful wall. But, listen, we can de-
bate that at another time.
Right now, we have to open our gov-
ernment so that we can get back to the
business for the people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1189
January 24, 2019
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle to come to the table and urge
Speaker PELOSI to come to the table to
negotiate an end to this shutdown.
This week, Democrats called us back
to Washington to solve this problem,
but they voted against paying Federal
workers three times over the past
week, while Republicans have been
standing up for those who have now
missed paychecks.
It has been 15 days since the Speaker
has sat down to negotiate with the
President.
Last week, I went to the White House
for what was supposed to be a bipar-
tisan meeting to discuss ending this
shutdown and, unfortunately, none of
my Democratic colleagues showed up.
Before Democrats even heard Presi-
dent Trump’s proposal offering a solu-
tion for DACA recipients and TPS indi-
viduals in return for border security,
they rejected it.
Speaker PELOSI gave the longest
speech ever in this Chamber, on pro-
tecting DACA recipients, but now she
is refusing to provide certainty for
them.
We have an opportunity to get real
border security and protect DACA re-
cipients. It is time to set politics aside
and for the Speaker of the House to go
to the table, end this shutdown, and ne-
gotiate a deal with the President.
f
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Mrs. KIRKPATRICK asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speak-
er, I was in my district over the week-
end. We had a couple of marches. We
had a Women’s March. We had a march
for MLK Day.
A man approached me, and he said:
Representative KIRKPATRICK, I work for
the National Park Service. I am fur-
loughed. I have no income. I have
missed two paychecks.
He said: My 9-year-old son gave me
his Christmas gift card to help our
family get by.
He had tears in his eyes, and I am
tearing right now just telling that
story, because this shutdown is affect-
ing families, children.
The instability that these children
are feeling—and we don’t talk about
that enough—is going to affect them
for the rest of their lives.
We have got to open the government,
and we have got to do it now.
f
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Mr. BEYER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I re-
ceived an email Friday night from a
young lawyer I know in northern Vir-
ginia. I met him last year when he had
just hung out his shingle for a solo
practice.
He was desperate. His one big client
is a Federal Government contractor
who told him he would not be paid for
December or for January because of
the government shutdown.
He wrote me because he had just re-
ceived an eviction notice from his land-
lord: come up with the rent for Janu-
ary by Wednesday, noon, or face imme-
diate eviction.
I connected him with our local gov-
ernment office on emergency assist-
ance. He got some meaningful help. He
reached out to a few nonprofits and got
some more. He was only $800 short yes-
terday, and the landlord agreed to wait
another month.
Yes, the shutdown has left 800,000
Federal employees without the money
for life’s necessities, but it is also
harming American citizens far and
wide, cruelly and unnecessarily, vic-
tims of the inevitable multiplier ef-
fects of a Federal Government failing
its fiscal responsibility.
This should be the last ever Federal
shutdown. We must never again give a
President the power to hold the most
powerful and best managed government
hostage to his whims, obsessions, and
political knavery.
Mr. President, let our people go.
f
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, to all
my colleagues, I apologize. I may speak
just a little longer than 1 minute—not
much.
Madam Speaker, I was sitting in my
office just a few minutes ago and Rep-
resentative MICHAEL WALTZ, whom I do
not know, from the State of Florida
rose and said he was here in an empty
Capitol.
Scores of my fellow Democrats are
here because they are outraged that we
have shut down the people’s govern-
ment, and they are here, Mr. WALTZ, to
urge the President of the United States
and MITCH MCCONNELL to open up the
people’s government. That is why they
are here. They haven’t gone home, Con-
gressman WALTZ. We are here.
I don’t see anybody over here.
Madam Speaker, I rise to join with
my colleagues in highlighting the ab-
surdity of the Trump-McConnell shut-
down and share some of the ways, just
some few ways, it is affecting Ameri-
cans in my district.
Now, you can go to this website,
trumpshutdownstories.us, and get
scores more stories than I will be able
to tell on this floor in this short time
I will speak.
Maryland’s Fifth District, which I
have the great honor of having rep-
resented for the last 38 years, has 62,000
Federal employees, tens of thousands
of whom are not getting paid, and some
who are being forced—no, who are vol-
untarily working because they love
this country and they love their jobs,
and they are working without pay.
Is that any way to treat any em-
ployee, much less an employee working
for their government?
One woman from Prince George’s
County, Maryland, wrote to tell me
that her husband, an astrophysicist at
NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center,
is furloughed. She isn’t working be-
cause they have an infant, and he, the
only source of their income.
Another constituent wrote to tell me
that he serves in the Coast Guard. He
said:
As I was putting my 9-year-old son to bed
last night, he asked me, ‘‘Dad, how come
they are making you work without pay?’’
He went on to say:
I gave him an answer about having taken
an oath and that it is my duty to serve, but
he was still confused.
I share that young child’s concern
and confusion. Why would we do this?
What would lead us to show such dis-
respect for those who carry out our
policy?
All Americans should be confused
about why our hardworking public
servants would be forced to work with-
out pay or be told to go home and wait
while a paycheck doesn’t come.
It is not just Federal employees and
contractors who are affected.
And, by the way, we are going to
repay the Federal employees, as we
should. But the contractors, the small
business people, the small shop owners
in my district who have thousands of
their customers who aren’t being paid
and, therefore, are not customers.
One woman from St. Mary’s County,
the county in which I live, said:
We were scheduled to close on our home on
January 11, and we received a phone call 3
days before that we would not be going to
closing because our loan was on hold due to
the government shutdown. A time that is
supposed to be the happiest, and here we sit
with our house in boxes and living week to
week with a landlord. We don’t know if we
will lose our home.
Madam Speaker, I would tell Presi-
dent Trump to listen to these stories,
listen to the humanity that must be in
you, be sympathetic, be empathetic, be
caring about these people who are your
constituents, whom you are pledged to
protect.
Madam Speaker, I would ask the
President and Senator MCCONNELL to
hear the voices of men and women
their shutdown policies are hurting.
They are going to hear many more sto-
ries.
Democrats have voted now 11 times
to end this shutdown, and Republicans
and the President have blocked these
measures again and again.
Let me say, Madam Speaker, to those
who might be listening: We passed Re-
publican bills to open up this govern-
ment—not our bills, not partisan bills,

but Republican, Senate-passed bills
which would have opened up the gov-
ernment.
Madam Speaker, because we care so
deeply about our constituents who ei-
ther work for or are served by our gov-
ernment, we will continue to do every-
thing possible to reopen government
and share the stories of those being
held hostage by the President and Sen-
ator MCCONNELL.
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues for being on this floor to bring
their stories of their constituents, of
the President’s constituents, to his at-
tention, as well as Senator MCCONNELL.
f
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise
to call on President Trump and the
Senate to reopen the Federal Govern-
ment immediately.
A legion of Federal workers went to
work again this morning with no idea
how or when they will be able to pay
their bills or support their families,
workers like Tracy from my hometown
of Amsterdam, New York.
Tracy has worked for the USDA for
more than three decades helping up-
state New York farmers, with nowhere
else to turn, find the funds they need
to stay afloat for another season.
She says: ‘‘When you start to lose
farms, equipment dealers go out of
business. Everybody suffers—the char-
ities, the churches. If you can’t pay
your bills, you can’t go to the local
pancake breakfast on Sunday’’ to help
a not-for-profit.
This weekend, bitter cold hit New
York’s capital region. Tracy tells me
she hasn’t gone down to the basement
because she is afraid to see the level of
heating oil left in her tank.
Just as tough is the mental toll this
shutdown is taking. Until recently,
Tracy was furloughed. Now she is
working, working without pay. She
worries about the farmers who rely on
USDA loans to get seed and fertilizer
for the coming season.
When asked what she would say if
she were standing here in this spot
today, she said: ‘‘We need to take care
of one another. It doesn’t matter what
party you are. We need to help and up-
lift each other.’’
Madam Speaker, I urge the United
States Senate to heed Tracy’s call,
move forward with any one of the
many bills that we have passed here in
the House to reopen this government,
restore paychecks to our dedicated
Federal workers and the critical serv-
ices they provide to our neighbors who
need it, who need it most.

TRUMP SHUTDOWN
(Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend her remarks.)
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam
Speaker, today, I went to the Jose An-
dres food bank in Washington, D.C., for
Federal workers. I was stunned to see
hundreds waiting in line in the rain.
Inside, they were giving a hot meal
to everybody, as well as fresh vegeta-
bles, diapers, and feminine products.
And they were assisting those who
were in danger of missing utility pay-
ments.
As I served the workers, I asked them
what their jobs were. They worked for
the FBI, the Department of Justice,
and the D.C. Superior Court.
How many of these workers were
served by this food bank yesterday?
Eleven thousand.
They are like the Federal workers in
my district, people like Catherine, who
has back problems and now can’t afford
the copay for physical therapy and
epidurals, or Eric, who told me he had
to defer car maintenance in order to
avoid missing his son’s college tuition
payment.
This suffering could end right now.
But instead of ending their pain,
Trump ignores it. Just this morning,
his Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross,
said he could not understand why fur-
loughed workers have to go to food
banks. Well, I say: End this shutdown
today.
f
SHUTDOWN IMPACTS
(Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker,
this shutdown is causing fear, pain, and
stress for thousands of families in cen-
tral Florida.
Now, this may be confusing to the
President and to Senator MCCONNELL,
but to Brandon and his wife, who both
have Federal jobs in my district and
zero income coming in, it is all too
clear.
It is all too clear to Ralph, an Army
veteran who is trying to juggle ex-
penses for three children, including a
special needs child.
It is all too clear to Doug, who keeps
sensitive equipment working at the
airport, but now he is struggling to
cover daily expenses while also taking
care of his mother.
It is all too clear, Madam Speaker, to
my constituent Jeff, a Coast Guard re-
tiree, now a civilian employee, who is
working to raise money to help current
Coast Guard servicemen. But Jeff him-
self is also not receiving a paycheck.
Families like these—and there are
hundreds of thousands of them—are
real people with real pain.
The President and Senator MCCON-
NELL need to do the right thing and put
an end to this destructive shutdown
now.
f
DO YOUR JOBS, NOT PRESIDENT’S
BIDDING
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today because what our country is
going through is a disgrace: 800,000
Federal workers are going without a
paycheck. They are suffering, and their
families are suffering, all because the
President wants a wall that is nothing
more than a monument to hate. The
American people are tired of this Presi-
dent’s games.
Last night, I called some constitu-
ents who had contacted my office be-
cause they are furloughed due to the
Trump shutdown.
I talked to a Forest Service worker
from my district who has missed a pay-
check and doesn’t want to be used as a
bargaining chip by the President.
I talked to another constituent who
works at the National Archives and is
experiencing the consequences of this
shutdown. She knows that the longer
this drags on, the more people who will
get hurt.
Last night, I received a heart-
wrenching message from a constituent
who is experiencing hardship and needs
to apply for assistance programs, but
she can’t because she can’t even access
the information she needs from the Of-
fice of Personnel Management.
This has to end. We have voted not
once, not twice, but 11 times to reopen
the government. Leader MCCONNELL
and the Senate Republicans have
blocked these bills in the Senate every
step of the way. To them, I say:
Enough. Do your jobs, not the Presi-
dent’s bidding. 800,000 workers and the
rest of the American people demand it,
and so do we.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to heed the gavel.

SHUTTING DOWN GOVERNMENT IS
FAILED POLICY
(Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise to speak on behalf of Megan and
Rick, and their children, from Penn-
sylvania’s Sixth.
Rick answered the call after 9/11 to
join the Air National Guard. He was de-
ployed to Iraq in 2007 and Afghanistan
in 2008, and then hired as an air traffic
controller on a veteran preference. Cur-
rently, the family’s only income is
Rick’s.
In day 34, Megan now is selling items
online to try to get income for their
family because they have no idea how
long this shutdown will last. She has
called their daughter’s preschool to see
if they can withdraw her and get a re-
fund for the remainder of the school
year. She now has an appointment with
SNAP this week for food assistance for
her and her family.
Rick loves his job. He takes pride in
what he does, but this is taking a toll
on him as well. The family’s last-ditch
plan is to pull from their 401(k)’s and

incur severe penalties to be able to
keep a roof over their heads.
This tragedy is playing out in house-
hold after household in my community.
I am a third generation veteran. Bor-
der protection is an imperative and a
real issue, but a shutdown is not the
answer. I rise for the people like Megan
and Rick, because shutting down the
government is failed policy.
f
END THE SHUTDOWN NOW
(Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to ask my Republican col-
leagues, who continue to vote against
reopening the government, how they
respond to their constituents who are
suffering during this inhumane shut-
down.
For example, my office was con-
tacted by the wife of a Federal correc-
tions officer from South Carolina’s
Third District. Her husband works at
the Federal prison in Edgefield, and she
just had bariatric surgery and is unable
to work. She is unable to afford the vi-
tamins her doctor prescribed because
they are not covered by insurance.
Without these vitamins, she may de-
velop deficiencies that could cause
death.
To further add to their financial dif-
ficulties, her husband, as a correctional
officer, was required to sign a docu-
ment that he would not get another
job. They sacrificed a lot to build the
good credit score they have that this
shutdown is impacting, and their fam-
ily’s finances will be affected well into
the future.
Again, I ask my colleagues across the
aisle: How do you respond to your con-
stituents who are suffering?
They need leadership from the Presi-
dent, Leader MCCONNELL, and House
Republicans to end the shutdown now.
Enough is enough.
f
IMPACT OF SHUTDOWN ON SMALL
BUSINESSES
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, across
my district, the Seventh Congressional
District of Pennsylvania, and across
our country, this shutdown is hurting
small businesses.
One of my constituents is an entre-
preneur from Stroudsburg, Pennsyl-
vania. He recently emailed me to let
me know that he can’t get his manda-
tory employer ID number for the new
business he is trying to start because
the IRS is shut down. Until he gets
that number, he can’t set up payroll
for his employees or open a company
bank account.
Another constituent from Emmaus,
Pennsylvania, processes Small Busi-
ness Administration-backed loans to
entrepreneurs trying to start or expand
businesses. But, as he explains, since
the SBA has been shut down, no small
business loans have been going out. For
many, that means no access to capital
at reasonable interest rates and having
to turn to loan sharks to keep busi-
nesses afloat.
And let us never forget that our
Coast Guard is still working without
pay.
We were sent here to make people’s
lives better, not make them harder and
more stressful than they already are.
Members of both parties need to come
together to support our military and
the small businesses that power our
economy, and that means ending this
shutdown.

LET THEM EAT CAKE
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
let them eat cake—Marie Antoinette.
The Secretary of Commerce has indi-
cated that my $28,000-paid TSA agent
can walk into the Nation’s banks and
demand a loan. Well, right now, in my
district, the city and other good neigh-
bors are opening their doors to give
free groceries to those TSOs and other
wonderful Federal workers. I don’t
know what bank they can go into.
I can tell you that Edith, who just re-
turned from deployment in the Middle
East, is suffering. She hasn’t worked
for 25 days. To make matters worse,
she has to take temporary work in
order to help pay for her children. She
now is selling personal possessions to
make a difference.
Sandra, who recently came to Hous-
ton to work at NASA, came to start on
January 7 from Nebraska. She hasn’t
been able to work; she doesn’t have a
job; and she doesn’t have any money.
Or what about Linda, who has been
working and now has to work extra
shifts to help pay for her children? She,
too, is selling her items for rent, gro-
ceries, everything that is needed.
Let them eat cake. That is what is
being said by this administration.
Open the government. Pay our work-
ers now.
Mr. Republican, join us in the 11
times that we have voted to open the
government now.
Madam Speaker, today I rise to join my col-
leagues in condemning the President’s deci-
sion to shut down the federal government, fur-
loughing 800,000 civil servants and forcing
nearly half that many to work without pay, and
which is costing the economy more than $1
billion each day in lost productive and eco-
nomic output.
As the Trump Shutdown enters its thirty-
fourth day, the effects of President Trump and
Republicans’ reckless decision to shutter the
government over a wasteful and unnecessary
border wall are obvious.
A continuing resolution could be passed that
would provide funding for the federal govern-
ment through February 28, 2019 but it has not
been done.
Frontline federal employees, including law
enforcement and public safety personnel, have
been working without pay since December 22.
So many people have risked their lives in
order to serve this country and the way they
have been treated
This includes around 14,000 FBI agents,
54,000 Customs and Border Protection
agents, 47,000 Transportation Security Offi-
cers, and 6,000 Forest Service firefighters.
TSA employees received their last paycheck
on December 28, this single paycheck will
now have to stretch much further than they ini-
tially anticipated.
The shutdown has already forced some em-
ployees to look for new jobs or take on extra
work, and the pressure is immense for em-
ployees and families with no other source of
income.
Among those not receiving a pay check for
their work are 3,200 Secret Service agents
who risk their lives every single day to protect
President Trump and his family.
Speaker Pelosi’s decision to delay the State
of the Union is in defense of the Secret Serv-
ice agents who would be forced to work with-
out pay.
In addition to the federal employees working
without pay, hardworking federal employees at
agencies like the Department of Justice, the
Department of Homeland Security, the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and NASA have been fur-
loughed without pay, plunging them and their
families into uncertainty.
These are real American families that are
being put through an unwarranted and unnec-
essary shutdown, and they are suffering be-
cause of it.
With many federal employees being fur-
loughed, and those deemed essential being
expected to work without pay American fami-
lies are now stuck wondering how they are
going to get by without an income, especially
since things like rent, groceries, children’s pre-
scriptions and general day-to-day living costs
must still be paid whether the government is
fully functional or not.
The Trump Shutdown will end when the
President comes to his senses.
The Republican members of the House and
the Republican controlled Senate can send a
message to the President to end the shutdown
by voting a veto proof margin in favor of a
short term continuing resolution.
Not only are Americans struggling to pay for
their day-to-day expenses but veterans and
military families are suffering as well.
The shutdown has lasted long enough that
the Department of Veterans Affairs has said
that it may not have enough money to pay dis-
ability claims and pension payments.
This could affect approximately 3.6 million
veterans.
The military is also suffering in other areas.
For example, changes of station for military
personnel will be delayed and facility and
weapons maintenance could be suspended.
Military commissaries (base grocery stores)
have shut down and military families are being
forced to shop elsewhere, costing up to 30
percent more on average than at the com-
missaries.
The United States Coast Guard is still with-
out funding.
This is an added expense that adds up
quickly, especially for military families living in
cities with a high cost of living.

reservist deployment in the Middle East is

among thousands of people in the Houston
area feeling the impact of the government
shutdown.
Edith has not worked her federal job in
downtown Houston since the shutdown 25
days ago.
Making matters worse, she and dozens of
others in Houston are unable to seek tem-
porary private sector work because such jobs
require permission, and the people who proc-
ess those requests have been furloughed.
Edith has begun selling her personal pos-
sessions to make ends meet, but she said an-
other couple of weeks of no work would be
crushing.
There are so many other issues that we
could tackle with the money Trump wants to
spend on the wall.
With an increase of $265 million the Depart-
ment of Justice could hire 2,000 new police of-
ficers and make steps towards making many
communities a safer place.
With an increase of $99 million the Office of
National Drug Control Policy could support
community-level efforts to address substance
abuse programs in nearly 730 additional com-
munities.
With an increase of $200 million the Eco-
nomic Development Administration could cre-
ate or preserve 31,000 jobs for our hard-
working Americans.
With an additional $20 million Small Busi-
ness Administration grants could support doz-
ens more Women’s Business and Veterans
Outreach Centers providing business training,
counseling and outreach to 47,000 additional
U.S. veterans and women
These are the changes that American citi-
zens deserve.
Madam Speaker, it is critical that the Presi-
dent ends this government shutdown and end
the unwarranted suffering of American families
across the nation.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN’S
IMPACT ON NATIONAL SECURITY
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker,
over the past 34 days, we have heard
that this shutdown is about security.
Well, I am a former undercover CIA of-
ficer, so let’s talk about security.
There is nothing secure about FBI
agents working without pay. There is
nothing secure about them closing
down investigations and losing their
informants, their counterterrorism in-
formants.
There is nothing secure about TSA
employees who keep us safe in the air-
space working without pay.
There is nothing secure about our
Customs and Border Patrol agents, who
work along the very border we are dis-
cussing, working without pay.
There is nothing secure about our air
traffic controllers working 10 hours a
day to keep our airplanes safe in the
air.
There is nothing secure about our
diplomats, who work in war zones and
around the world to keep this country
safe, working without pay.
There is nothing secure about the
42,000 dedicated members of the U.S.
Coast Guard working without pay as
they defend our shores.
The public servants who work every
single day to protect the lives of their
fellow American citizens deserve bet-
ter. I know this because I used to be
one of them.
This shutdown is a disgrace. It is
hurting our national security. We must
end it now so that Americans can sleep
safely at night; Federal workers can re-
ceive the paychecks they have earned;
and our country’s military, economic,
and diplomatic strength can be pre-
served before it is too late.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I
stand here today to share the story of
Laurie Wall, a Las Vegas resident, a
mother of three, and a Federal em-
ployee denied a paycheck because of
this government shutdown.
Like many of Nevada’s Federal em-
ployees, Laurie is still reporting to
work every single day, doing her job on
behalf of the American people. But be-
cause she is not getting paid, Laurie
also has to add trips to the local food
bank to pick up needed food and dia-
pers for her family.
Because of this shutdown, 3,520 Ne-
vada-based Federal employees are
being denied a paycheck; 30,000 south-
ern Nevadans are at risk of homeless-
ness because of reduced housing assist-
ance; and 34,000 people in my district
could lose their nutritional assistance.
The House has already voted 11 times
to reopen the government. It is long
past time that the Senate does the
same and stops holding Nevadans like
Laurie Wall hostage.

OPEN UP THE GOVERNMENT
(Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
here we are in the fifth week of this
shutdown.
I want to talk about two stories.
One is Tyler. He is a resident of Gold-
en, Colorado. I have known his family
a long time. He has two small children.
He says: Two weeks ago, I received a
certificate from the United States of
America thanking me for working for
the air traffic controllers for 10 years.
The same day, I got a check for zero
dollars.
Then I want to talk about a young
woman who works for the EPA. She
has two children with disabilities. She
is a patriot. She has a chemistry de-
gree. She could work in a million dif-
ferent places. She wanted to work for
us, for the United States of America, to
serve the public, to give back to the
United States. But now she has to
question, with two young kids with dis-
abilities, whether she can do this any-
more. She expected us to be reliable as
employers, and we are not.
We are better than this, Mr. Presi-
dent. Open up the government.

(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given

Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, every
day I hear from constituents about how
this manufactured crisis is hurting
them and hurting their families. MITCH
MCCONNELL’s and President Trump’s
refusal to reopen government has con-
sequences for real people.
A Marine veteran from Bay City,
Michigan, won’t receive his monthly
housing allowance this week that he
needs to pay his rent and make his car
payment. His words to me were this: ‘‘I
never thought the President would be
putting us veterans that he says he
loves so much in harm’s way just to
get money for his harebrained immi-
gration solution.’’
That is from a United States veteran
who served this country and is now
being treated by the President of the
United States as a pawn in a political
game to get something that he is not
willing to submit to the legislative
process.
Shame on this President. Shame on
him. Open this government. Do it now.

(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given

Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to commend the good people
of the Fifth District of Pennsylvania,
who are helping their neighbors, the
Federal workers, contractors, and fam-
ilies who have been so grievously im-
pacted by the government shutdown.
As the human and financial toll of
this senseless shutdown has spread, we
have seen locals step up and help those
who are struggling without pay. What
a contrast with this administration
where Cabinet members said today
that they didn’t understand why an un-
paid worker might have to resort to a
food bank to feed his family.
Unlike this administration and the
Senate majority leader, our neighbors
have recognized the true impact of the
shutdown and are doing something
about it. We have seen youth groups,
and fire departments, and local organi-
zations organize food drives. Nonprofits
are collecting donations and organizing
food pantries so Federal workers can
feed their families.
I urge the President and the Senate
majority leader to put people before
politics. People are not bargaining
chips. The shutdown needs to end now.

(Mr. CISNEROS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, the
time has come for the President to end
this shutdown and put our Federal
workers above political bickering.
Hundreds of thousands of Federal
workers, many of them veterans, con-
tinue to show up to work every day
without pay. TSA employees, FBI em-
ployees, air traffic controllers, coast-
guardsmen and women as well as many
others continue to make the security
and safety of our Nation a top priority.
One such person that I spoke to is
Lupe Mejia. Lupe is a veteran, who cur-
rently works for the FBI on counter-
terrorism issues. Her husband also
works for the FBI, and neither one of
them is getting paid.
During this shutdown, Lupe has been
going to food banks to keep food costs
down. Paying the bills has become a
struggle, and she is trying to do this
all without dipping into their family
savings, but it is getting harder and
harder each day.
Madam Speaker, I say to the Presi-
dent that his shutdown is causing hard-
ship to families like Lupe’s all across
this country. Thirty-four days is long
enough.
Let’s do what is right and pay our
Federal employees, especially those
who put their lives on the line for our
country. They deserve to be com-
pensated for the work they do and the
security they provide. Let’s bring san-
ity back to government, and I call on
the President to tomorrow end this
shutdown.

(Mr. LUJÁN asked and was given per-

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LUJÁN. Madam Speaker, the
pain from this Trump shutdown is
being felt deeply in every corner of my
district in New Mexico and across
America.
We have farmers and ranchers that
are unable to plan for their production.
Tribal communities are facing disrup-
tions in their healthcare services. Peo-
ple are not getting urgent questions
answered by the IRS, and some fami-
lies are worried that there are going to
be liens put on their homes.
A local health clinic in my district,
the Pecos Valley Medical Center had
their Federal loan halted, even though
the project has been approved, which
means they can’t draw down on funds.
This means they will have to pause
their efforts to expand access to men-
tal healthcare and it could jeopardize
the project.
Over 800,000 families, individuals
across America are not being paid.
Over 150,000 veterans that are fur-
loughed, some of them are working
without being paid. Chef Jose Andres is
feeding thousands of people who are
lining up just down the street between
here and the White House.
Madam Speaker, I say to the Presi-
dent, come outside and go see what
Chef Andres is doing. These families
are hurting. End this shutdown. It can
end today.

Ms. HILL of California. Madam
Speaker, I was elected to fight for the
people of my district, to challenge the
way things are done here in Wash-
ington, and make sure our government
starts working for the people. But it
can’t work for the people when it is not
working at all.
It is not working for Christy, a hard-
working air traffic controller, veteran,
and single mother of two who is terri-
fied. When she doesn’t get her pay-
check tomorrow, she won’t be able to
feed her kids. She works a good job.
She shouldn’t be afraid of meeting her
kids’ basic needs, and now she is look-
ing for a job at night as a bartender.
It is not working for Eric, a 17-year
career employee at the Federal Avia-
tion Agency. He wrote to me, ‘‘As an
integral part of the Nation’s air traffic
control system, my focus has always
been, and will always be, on safety.’’
That is true for so many of the law
enforcement officials, aviation special-
ists, and firefighters who are affected
by this shutdown. They are focusing on
our safety, and in return, they are not
receiving pay for their work. Every
day, that safety becomes more and
more compromised.
It is not working for Diane, who
works for the Angeles National Forest
and lives paycheck to paycheck as al-
most 80 percent of this country does.
She is gearing up for the economic tur-
moil of not getting a second paycheck
tomorrow.
It is not working for John, who pro-
tects us, as a Federal prison guard,
from terrorists, who is now driving
Uber after his shifts in order to pay the
bills.

the President, and our fellow Senators
to open the government right now.

Wilbur Ross, the Marie Antoinette of
the Trump administration, said he
‘‘doesn’t understand why Federal work-
ers need to go to food banks.’’ Oh, my
God. He might as well have said: Let
them eat cake.
This President and his Cabinet are so
out of touch, it is pathetic. Here are
just a few emails I have gotten this
week.
A law enforcement officer in my dis-
trict says: ‘‘We struggle, but pinch pen-
nies so our child can attend a good
school. My mortgage company put us
in no-pay status. The shutdown is put-
ting us at risk of losing our home.’’
A Customs and Border Patrol em-
ployee says: ‘‘We have bills to pay, like
nursery school and daycare. What’s
going to happen to us? I am sick over
this.’’
A Fish and Wildlife Service worker
writes: ‘‘I am proud to serve the Amer-
ican public. But right now, I can’t even
serve my family dinner.’’
Madam Speaker, President Trump’s
publicity stunt is hurting America’s
hardworking public servants. It is
cruel. Shame on him and shame on Ma-
jority Leader MCCONNELL for refusing
to end this shutdown. He, along with
the President, need to grow up. They

Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, at
its most basic level, the government
should keep us safe. On the 34th day of
the longest government shutdown in
our Nation’s history, hundreds of thou-
sands of Federal workers tasked with
keeping us safe are working without
pay.
As the men and women of TSA, air
traffic control, the FBI, the United
States Coast Guard, and many other
government agencies continue to per-
form their duties, many live with the
uncertainty and fear of not knowing
how they are going to pay their mort-
gage or feed their families.
In less than 2 weeks, millions will
come to Atlanta, Georgia, the district I
represent, and they will be flooding in
for the Super Bowl. Having been a
flight attendant for 30 years, I am very
afraid. I am deeply concerned for the
Atlanta airport’s TSA agents, air traf-
fic controllers, and for the Federal
agencies tasked with ensuring the pub-
lic safety during this event.
President Trump said he would shut
down the government for a wall that he
claims will make us safer, but, in fact,
his shutdown has made us less safe. I
will continue, along with my Demo-
cratic colleagues, to support bipartisan
funding packages to reopen the govern-
ment.

Doris works as an investigative pro-
gram officer for the Department of
Homeland Security. For over 27 years,
she has devoted her life to the safety
and the security of our community.
Today marks the 34th day of this irre-
sponsible shutdown. It also marks the
34th day that Doris will be going to
work without getting a paycheck.
She has received notice that her de-
partment will miss a second pay pe-
riod; something that her supervisor has
told her will affect her retirement sta-
tus.
This nightmare has affected her fi-
nancially, mentally, and emotionally.
She is terrified about having to default
on her mortgage and not having
enough money to cover her car pay-
ments or put food on the table.
Later today, Doris is planning to
stand in line at a nearby parking lot to
receive a head of lettuce and some to-
matoes from a local food bank. Is this
what the administration thought of
when they initiated this shutdown? Is
this what the greatest country in the
world has succumbed to?
It angers me to know that Doris is
being used as pawn to fulfill a cam-
paign promise. Madam Speaker, I say
to the President that we do our jobs
and he does his. Open the government.

Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, across
this country and in my hometown of

eral workers, our economy, and the
health and safety of the American peo-
ple.
I have heard from my constituents
across my district that this shutdown
is disrupting their lives. Many Federal
workers are frustrated. They just want
to return to work. Yet, now they can’t
work, or they are working without pay.
They can’t pay their bills. The con-
sequences of this shutdown affect us
all.
I have heard from a U.S. Coast Guard
veteran who answered the call to serve
his country for over 20 years and re-
tired with honors. Now, because of the
shutdown, his pension isn’t being proc-
essed. He is worried about his bills, and
is heartbroken that this country he
served for so many years is not hon-
oring its promise to take care of him in
return.
Another person who is a TSA agent
working without pay at Sacramento’s
airport said it is hard to concentrate at
work when she is thinking about the
bills stacking up. She is able to pay for
January’s rent with savings, but if this
shutdown continues through February,
she will not have enough money for
rent, leaving her to choose between
being evicted or moving out on her own
and becoming homeless.
Our Federal workers deserve an em-
ployer that honors its promises and
provides for its workforce. It is time
for President Trump and Majority
Leader MCCONNELL to fully fund the
government and put an end to the pain
and suffering of the American people.

Our Governor just asked our higher
education board to step in and protect
Nevada’s college students from pen-
alties, and the speaker of our legisla-
ture just introduced a bill to protect
Federal workers from debt collectors
and landlords. Get the picture?
We are now stressing our State and

New York, has been forced to do.
Others in my district, nonprofit em-

else.

of the Federal workforce is African
American. This is, of course, due to dis-
crimination against African Americans

and a path into the middle class.
My grandfather worked for the Post-

MCCONNELL to stop playing games with
people’s lives. Let’s reopen the govern-
ment and get workers the paychecks
that they deserve.

THE SHUTDOWN HURTS NEW
JERSEY FAMILIES
(Mr. PALLONE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, 34
days into the Trump shutdown, New
Jersey families are hurting: 5,000 Fed-
eral workers have lost their paycheck;
millions more are being harmed by the
closure of critical services.
In my district in Edison, many EPA
employees are being prevented from
doing their jobs. These dedicated pub-
lic servants help clean up contami-
nated sites. They keep our drinking
water safe. Meanwhile, at the NOAA
lab at Sandy Hook, they are unable to
conduct urgent research on climate
change.
One of my EPA workers said: ‘‘Mr.
President, please open the government.
Do your job so we can do our job.’’ I
couldn’t agree more.
Members of the Coast Guard at
Sandy Hook in my district are going
without pay. These are the men and
women who risked their lives to keep
us safe during Superstorm Sandy, and
they deserve a paycheck.
An IRS worker from my district said:
‘‘This is the first time in my life that
I have ever had to go to a food bank for
food. Not knowing where food is com-
ing from is scary.’’ And she went on to
say that she fears being evicted from
her apartment. This is an IRS worker.
Madam Speaker, House Democrats
have voted 11 times on bipartisan legis-
lation. It is time to open the govern-
ment, Mr. President.
f
THE IMPACT OF THIS
UNPRECEDENTED SHUTDOWN
(Ms. STEVENS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today for the people suffering the
consequences of this shutdown. I rise
today for our great country and for the
belief in our great government. I rise
for our neighbors, our friends, and all
our taxpayers.
The impact of this unprecedented
shutdown, the longest in our history,
has had real and deeply concerning im-
pacts on our families, particularly in
Michigan. It is also posing serious
threats to our national security and
safety.
Tim Mach of Waterford, Michigan, a
professional aviation safety specialist,
has been working diligently through-
out this shutdown. He is doing the best
he can with the materials he has to en-
sure our airplanes are safe, but he is
unable to access the parts for the
planes that are damaged.
The longer this shutdown drags on,
the more dire these types of operations
become. For the well-being of our pub-
lic servants and the safety of our coun-
try, the government must open today.
Madam Speaker, I rise today from
this body as his voice, imploring the
less than 600 among us who have been
elected to this Federal Government to
open this government now.
f
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS
SUFFER THROUGH THE SHUTDOWN
(Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam
Speaker, on this, the 34th day of the
longest shutdown in American history,
I sat down with a group of air traffic
controllers in my office today.
These workers told me about how an
already stressful job has been made
even worse by this shutdown, that
many of them are working 6 days a
week, 10 hours a day with no pay.
They know that their work requires
no mistakes because it is life and
death, but to make matters even
worse, 30 percent of them are already
stretched thin and currently are eligi-
ble to retire, and many are considering
retiring earlier so that they can at
least get a paycheck.
In the words of Ranika, one of the air
traffic controllers: This shutdown is
the perfect storm for a national emer-
gency.
Madam Speaker, the collateral dam-
age of this shutdown is difficult to
fathom, but this much is clear: Every
day that goes by, we are less safe, our
economy is more weakened, and all
Americans from all backgrounds suffer.
This must end. Open the government.
f
HUNDREDS HURT BY SHUTDOWN
(Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, we
are now in day 34 of the longest shut-
down in American history.
Over the course of this shutdown, I
have heard from hundreds of people in
my community who are being hurt by
this reckless shutdown. Today, I would
like to share the story of Graciela, who
wrote to me from my hometown of
Redlands.
Graciela has worked for the IRS for
over 40 years, and her Federal job al-
lows her to care for her daughter, who
is suffering from thyroid cancer.
Graciela wrote to me and said: ‘‘Each
missed paycheck is another 2 weeks
that my daughter will go without
medication and treatment.’’
It is outrageous that, in the face of
this type of suffering, real human suf-
fering, our President can remain so cal-
lous.
We have voted 11 times to reopen this
government, but instead of working
with us to end this shutdown, the
President and Leader MCCONNELL con-
tinue to move the goalpost and insist
on funding for their ineffective and
wasteful border wall and cuts to legal
immigration.
Our country deserves better than
leaders who are willing to hold their
people hostage.
Graciela concluded her message to
me by saying this: ‘‘The President’s
misconceived notion that this country
needs a wall more than its own citizens
need to go back to work or to be paid
for the work they are doing is mind-
boggling.’’
Madam Speaker, Americans are suf-
fering and deserve better.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

END THIS GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN
(Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Speaker, I rise to demand, insist, and
beseech President Trump to end this
shutdown now and open the Federal
Government.
I represent the fifth largest number
of Federal Government employees.
Every day I see, I hear, and I feel the
pain and suffering of the Federal Gov-
ernment employees and contractors in
my neighborhoods and my commu-
nities. One out of every ten residents in
my Maryland district live in a house-
hold headed by a Federal Government
employee or contractor.
This Monday at a community event
supporting our Federal employees, I
met a woman with her 2-month-old in-
fant child. She is an essential employee
at the Food and Drug Administration.
She needs to be and wants to be on the
job, but she simply can’t. She can’t be-
cause she can’t afford to pay for
childcare for her infant daughter.
She is having difficulty paying for
groceries, providing lunch money for
her two elementary school-aged boys,
and is on the verge of not being able to
pay either her rent or her car note.
She was sobbing uncontrollably. She
was weeping painfully, and pleading for
you, Mr. President, to open the govern-
ment, to let her work with dignity, to
support her children, and to do her job.

(Mr. EVANS asked and was given

Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, it is
day 34 of the Trump shutdown.
Tomorrow will mark the second
missed paycheck for 800,000 Federal
workers and for many Federal contrac-
tors, as well.
I have spent parts of 2 days at the
Philadelphia airport meeting with the
workers and seeing the needs. These
people in the groups are stepping up.
Everyone is looking to the Repub-
licans and the President to step up. We

SHUTDOWN HAS TURNED LIVES
UPSIDE DOWN
(Ms. WEXTON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, my
district in Northern Virginia is home
to tens of thousands of Federal work-
ers, and even more contractors who
work alongside them.
I have heard from hundreds of con-
stituents about how the shutdown has
turned their lives upside down, like Te-
resa, who is a furloughed Federal work-
er.
She and her husband recently sold
their home and signed a contract to
purchase another one in my district.
The mortgage financing for their pur-
chase was all set and approved before
the shutdown. Their closing date is set
for next Monday, the 28th, 4 days from
now.
But just a couple days ago, they
learned that the mortgage company is
now denying their mortgage applica-
tion because she is furloughed. She was
told by the lender that they consider
her unemployed and too much of a risk
to finance.
This is a Federal employee who will
receive backpay when this shutdown
eventually ends, but that isn’t enough
for the mortgage company. It isn’t
enough for any of their other creditors,
and now she and her family, instead of
celebrating moving into their new
home, are essentially homeless, all be-
cause of the reckless Trump-McConnell
shutdown.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Ms. WATERS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker,
today, thousands of air traffic control-
lers, who we know are essential to our
safety and work in one of the most
stressful work environments, have had
to work without being paid for 34 days.
Unions for air traffic controllers, pi-
lots, and flight attendants released a
letter today describing the impact of
this shutdown. This is what they
wrote: ‘‘We have a growing concern for
the safety and security of our mem-
bers, our airlines, and the traveling
public due to the government shut-
down. This is already the longest gov-
ernment shutdown in the history of the
United States, and there is no end in
sight. In our risk-averse industry, we
cannot even calculate the level of risk
currently at play nor predict the point
at which the entire system will break.
It is unprecedented.’’
This is unconscionable.
Mr. President, you took credit for
this shutdown. You said you would ac-
cept the responsibility. You said you
own this shutdown. Are you going to
own and take responsibility for the loss
of lives for a catastrophe that will be
caused in the sky because you are hold-
ing the American people hostage for a
political agenda that has no credibility
whatsoever?
f
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.)
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Madam Speaker, it is time to
end this shutdown, which is hurting
working Americans and damaging the
overall economy.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says
that the shutdown is harming the
American people, American business,
and the economy.
So far, it has cost the United States
economy about a half percentage point
of overall economic growth. That is
about $25 billion.
JPMorgan Chase estimates that the
shutdown is now reducing economic
output up to $10 billion each week.
Even the administration has doubled
its estimate of the economic cost. It
says that, if the shutdown lasts
through March, we could have zero
growth this quarter. Some forecasters
even project that growth could turn
negative.
Mr. President, open this government
for the people. The people are hurting.
Enough is enough.
f
REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT NOW
(Mr. SOTO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, America
is in crisis. What will it take for the
President to reopen the government?
Will it take families across America to
not get their tax return? Will it take
Federal employees going without a sec-
ond paycheck or without healthcare?
Will it take millions of families who
are going hungry without SNAP, with-
out food assistance?
Maybe it will take Customs and Bor-
der Patrol walking off the job or
uninspected planes falling from the sky
due to mechanical failure—or worse.
I have here a letter from Doug Lowe,
one of my constituents, who is an avia-
tion specialist, and he talks about how
these planes aren’t even being in-
spected right now.
Or, even worse, for all the President’s
bragging about the economy, we could
be going into a recession in what would
otherwise be a boom period.
So I ask again: President Trump,
what will it take? What disaster will it
take for you to reopen this government
now?
f
OPEN THE GOVERNMENT NOW
(Ms. JOHNSON of Texas asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam
Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Fed-
eral employees in my district and
around the Nation.
For over a month now, 800,000 coast-
guardsmen, TSA agents, and air traffic
controllers have been held hostage by
President Trump’s shutdown, a shut-
down with far-reaching consequences.
Due to staffing shortages at Dallas’
two major airports, shortages that
have resulted from the TSA agents
being forced to live the last 34 days
without pay, aviation experts have
warned that flying today is less safe
than over a month ago.
Madam Speaker, since President
Trump irresponsibly shut government
down, I have heard from countless TSA
agents and the national air traffic con-
trollers in my district. They have all
indicated that, while they are com-
mitted to their duties, they are also
suffering financially and need the gov-
ernment reopened now.
I stand with them. Every member of
our Caucus is standing together, call-
ing on the White House to open the
government now.

Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I
also rise to share a shutdown story
from my district in the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands.
Vanessa Thomas, a resident of St.
Thomas, shared a heartfelt story with
me on her personal experience with the
government shutdown.
In 2017, less than 2 years ago, she lost
her home in the two hurricanes that we
had. Her home insurance is through the
USDA Rural Development program.
Prior to the shutdown, she did not re-
ceive homeowners insurance payments
regularly. Now, with the shutdown, she
is forced to use her own money to pay

for materials and labor to repair her
home. She has to choose between hav-
ing her daughter sit out a semester in
college or saving her home.
This is one among many stories that
are threatening residents of our coun-
try.
Today, I strongly urge the President
to end this shutdown now, imme-
diately.
Today, we cannot continue using
Federal employees and Federal funds
as pawns in a political game.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to address
the devastating impacts this shutdown
is having on families throughout Okla-
homa’s Fifth District.
Over the Martin Luther King, Jr.,
holiday weekend, I went back to my
district and visited with impacted Fed-
eral workers. The stories of the im-
pacts were heartbreaking.
One of the things that stuck with me
was speaking with a woman named
Tammy, who reminded me that it is
not just the government that is shut-
tered right now, but that families’ lives
are also being shattered. That is, too
often, the forgotten part of this con-
versation. We should never use Federal
employees, contractors, or their fami-
lies as pawns in a political disagree-
ment.
So, while we are analyzing the cur-
rent negative effects of this shutdown,
we also need to look at the long-lasting
effects on families, on our commu-
nities, and on the economy.
Simply put, we will be suffering the
negative consequences of this shut-
down for years to come, and the stories
I have heard from Oklahoma families
are the reasons I will continue to work
to reopen the government.
f
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise
following our 11th vote earlier today to
reopen government and end the sense-
less chaos and the pain of this shut-
down.
Why won’t the Republicans take yes
for an answer? Why won’t they provide
relief for the hardworking Americans
suffering in their own communities?
It is important to note, Madam
Speaker, that on every occasion we
have presented to the floor initiatives
that had been passed by the Repub-
licans in the Senate, just their own
bills, sending them back to them, and
they have said no, or their bills acted
upon by a bipartisan group in the
House, our most recent contribution to
send over to the Senate, and they have
said no.
And today, in the simplest—the sim-
plest—of resolutions, we said please
vote ‘‘yes’’ for $12 billion for disaster
assistance—we all know that we have
to do that—and open up the govern-
ment for 2 weeks in order to have a dis-
cussion of how best to protect our bor-
ders. And they said no.
Madam Speaker, $12 billion for dis-
aster assistance and 2 weeks of opening
up government to allow the debate to
continue so that people can come to
work and those who are working al-
ready, all of them, can be paid:
Americans like Brenda from Maine,
whose family can no longer pay for
heating fuel this winter, while tem-
peratures remain below freezing;
Americans like Julie from rural
Iowa, who says that farmers, already
hit hard by tariffs, will feel the squeeze
even more now;
Americans like Sarah from Colorado,
whose new job at the VA is on hold,
adding to wait times for veterans who
need healthcare services; and.
Veterans, who comprise nearly a
third of our Federal workforce, 31 per-
cent. Our veterans’ security clearances
are at risk. You can lose your security
clearance if you lose your credit rat-
ing, and you can lose your credit rating
if you cannot pay your bills on time—
your mortgage, your rent, your car
payment, your credit card bills, and
the rest. If your credit rating goes
down, the vulnerability of your secu-
rity clearance is increased.
So it is harmful to our veterans to be
doing this, and it is important for ev-
eryone to know how they are affected
because our veterans, who have donned
the uniform of our country to protect
us and then carry on their commit-
ment to public service in the public
sector as Federal employees—in some
ways still continuing to protect us, in
other ways meeting our needs in an-
other way—all of them are affected by
this shutdown.
Or like Lila from Georgia, who says:
‘‘Food stamp recipients will go hungry.
Many will lose subsidized housing.
State and local services will be over-
whelmed trying to make up for the
losses.’’
One woman, Vivian, from Maine,
asked: ‘‘How is a wall more important
than families?’’
This senseless shutdown throws the
American people’s safety and security
into peril.
This week, FBI agents released a re-
port warning of the dire effects of the
shutdown on nearly every aspect of
their work.
The FBI writes: ‘‘We don’t have funds
to get drugs and guns off the streets
and to prosecute the violent gang and
drug traffickers. . . . ’’
‘‘We aren’t able to take child sexual
exploitation cases to grand jury to
seek indictments and warrants in order
to get our most violent offenders ar-
rested. . . . This just puts our children
in jeopardy. . . . ’’
‘‘We have no funds’’ to pay sources
that provide cybersecurity intelligence
to protect the country ‘‘against our
foreign adversaries.’’
And they conclude: ‘‘The fear,’’ dur-
ing this disastrous shutdown, ‘‘is our
enemies know they can run freely.’’
The FBI talked about children, put-
ting our children in jeopardy. This
shutdown is putting so many children
and the families of our Federal workers
in jeopardy as well.
Those of us who have had the privi-
lege of serving those in food lines and
the rest, to listen and hear their sto-
ries, can tell you firsthand that this is
making enough impact that it is mate-
rial for sure. It is about their financial
security, but psychological as well.
We are doing serious damage to our
country, totally unnecessarily.
The President and the Republicans
either do not notice or do not care
about the real effects of this shutdown
on real people. They say: Oh, you will
get paid later.
Well, they have to pay their bills on
time, not sometime later.
This morning, when told that many
Federal workers were going to food
banks, Treasury Secretary Wilbur Ross
said: ‘‘I don’t quite understand why.’’
As hundreds of thousands of workers
are about to miss a second paycheck
tomorrow, Secretary Ross does not
know why people without a paycheck
have to go to food lines.
This Marie Antoinette attitude of
‘‘let them eat cake’’ is pervasive in the
administration. The President thinks, I
guess, that they can call their dads for
money.
Hours after Secretary Ross made his
statement, White House economic ad-
viser Larry Kudlow doubled down on
this administration’s ‘‘let them eat
cake’’ attitude, saying that the shut-
down was ‘‘just a glitch.’’
Just a glitch? Maybe to you it is a
glitch, but it is a paycheck to our Fed-
eral employees and the work they do
for us.
b 1715
So they are being harmed by not get-
ting paid. The people they serve, the
American people, are being harmed by
not being served.
Our economy will suffer a downturn.
It does, at these times. The President’s
own economic advisers can tell them
that.
This shutdown is not a glitch. It is a
crisis that the President alone created
and that the President alone can end.
The Republicans in the Congress have
been accomplices to the President’s ir-
responsibility in just ignoring the con-
sequences of his actions. Either he
doesn’t know or he doesn’t care, but,
nonetheless, the Trump shutdown goes
on.
Once again, we call on the President
and the Republicans in Congress, espe-
cially in the United States Senate,
where they are holding this up, to re-
open government now for the sake of
the health, the safety, and the well-
being of the American people.

what they do to meet the needs of the

American people, for the role they play
in providing the public-sector promise
that we make to people to meet their
needs, to provide the services of the
courts and the protections of our secu-
rity in terms of the FBI, of TSA, of the
Coast Guard.
The cost of this shutdown—the Coast
Guard is the only defense entity that is
not being paid. Because this is a 25 per-
cent shutdown, 75 percent of the work-
force is at work. The Department of
Defense is at work, but the Department
of Homeland Security is not, and that
is what the Coast Guard falls under.
Imagine those responsible for search
and rescue and emergency situations
having to go to food banks to get food
for their families. How does that keep
them as strong as they can possibly be,
as strong as they can possibly be to
search and rescue and to protect us?
They are a line of defense in securing
our borders.
A lot of the discussion is about se-
cure borders. Well, our borders extend
to the seas, and our Coast Guard is our
line of defense there. In our proposals
for the opening up of government, we
have funding for our Coast Guard for
assets that they have asked us for.
This is a tragedy in so many re-
spects. It shouldn’t go on any longer.
We should at least be able to discuss
and compare the merits of our different
proposals, and we should be able to do
that with government open and not
holding the American people hostage,
Federal employees hostage, the secu-
rity of our people hostage, and the
safety and well-being of our children
hostage to an idle campaign applause
line that the President seems com-
mitted to at this time.

EFFECTS OF THE SHUTDOWN
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
MCCOLLUM). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the
gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PIN-
GREE) is recognized for 60 minutes as
the designee of the majority leader.
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased we are able to be here tonight
to have an hour with some of my col-
leagues to continue this conversation
about the hardships people are facing
due to this shutdown and the impact it
is having on our country.
We have had so many interesting sto-
ries and tragic recollections of exactly
what people are going through. As our
Speaker, Speaker PELOSI, just said, we
are holding Federal employees hostage;
we are holding the safety of our coun-
try hostage; we are holding the Amer-
ican people hostage; and it is time to
get the government going again and re-
solve our differences.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my
Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Maine?
There was no objection.
Ms. PINGREE. So today is the 34th
day of the longest government shut-
down in history. It is a shutdown that
has no excuse, and it has taken a great
toll on dedicated public servants and
their families across America.
Americans who have jobs are actu-
ally standing in line at food pantries
here in Washington and back home in
my State of Maine.
This Chamber, as of today, has voted
11 times to fund the government, to
pay 800,000 workers, and to restart es-
sential services.
President Trump’s unwillingness to
reopen the government is tone deaf to
the financial circumstances of working
Americans. Most are living paycheck
to paycheck, pay mortgages and
healthcare premiums, and need to keep
food on the table. Government workers
and contractors cannot afford these
weeks being held hostage.
People who rely on government pro-
grams like SNAP and housing vouchers
are feeling the stress. They cannot af-
ford these weeks of being held hostage.
Businesses that are losing opportuni-
ties to expand and grow their busi-
nesses cannot afford these 3 weeks of
being held hostage.
The consequences of this shutdown
have rippled through our State and na-
tional economies. Members of Maine’s
Coast Guard, who protect us every sin-
gle day, are about to miss their second
paycheck while actively serving to pro-
tect our working waterfronts.
The USDA’s partial closure in Maine
has put Maine farmers in financial
limbo, and SNAP benefits for Maine’s
most vulnerable are on the verge of a
lapse. Many of Maine’s craft brewers,
who added $260 million to our State
economy last year, have had to put
new products and their businesses on
hold.
At this time, I will share a few of the
stories about what is happening and
what we are hearing from our constitu-
ents in Maine as a result of this shut-
down. I will read just a few clips from
letters I received and the stories
Mainers have shared with the local
news, and I will outline some of the
broader problems this historic shut-
down has created for real people.
We heard from a brewery in the proc-
ess of expanding to a second location.
They had all their paperwork in with
the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and
Trade Bureau in the Department of the
Treasury when the shutdown began,
but now that brewer is waiting with an
empty storefront.
Another brewery is just waiting for
approval to open six new types of beer,
all sitting and ready to be sold. As the
owner says:
January is already a tough time in Maine,
as I hope you know, and to lose out on weeks
of sales because of the shutdown may cause
us to close our doors. Please, I implore you,
do what you can to get the shutdown over
with.
We hear from a lot of Federal em-
ployees in our State. Here is one that
says:
Please do whatever you can to reopen the
government. I have 28 years of Federal serv-
ice and do not appreciate my financial secu-
rity being jeopardized by the President.
Another says:
Please do everything you can to help end
the government shutdown. As a furloughed
Federal employee, the anxiety of not know-
ing when or if I will be paid grows with every
day of the shutdown. I have savings to cover
a few months of living expenses, but I know
many in this situation don’t. We just want to
get back to work, and we don’t want to be
used as pawns.
Another says:
I am exempted from furlough, and I am
mandated to work without pay. This shut-
down is crushing me. I am a single father of
three who just went from a one-income
household to a no-income household. I keep
hearing the President insist that Federal
workers support this. I must have missed
that poll. No one has asked me for my input.
Please help end this shutdown soon. This is
not sustainable for me.
Another says:
This shutdown is the worst one that I have
been involved with since joining the Federal
Government decades ago. Earlier this week,
I went to my credit union to take out a per-
sonal loan to pay my bills. It is the first
time ever in my life I have had to do that.
Another says:
I work under a government contract, and I
have just been informed that I cannot come
back to work until this government shut-
down is over. This is a terrible time of year
for myself and my fellow coworkers to not
know when we can continue our work, not
that there is ever a good time for a shut-
down.
Well, the good news is, I have a lot
more stories like this, but I want to
share some of the time with my col-
leagues, and I will get back to reading
them more.
So I now yield to the gentlewoman
from Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD).
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker,
this week, we voted for the tenth time
to end the shutdown. For people in the
14th District of Illinois, the effects of
this Trump shutdown are real, and
they are painful.
This weekend, I visited a family shel-
ter for survivors of domestic violence
that does incredible work serving my
community. This shelter would like to
expand to serve even more people, but
funding uncertainty around reauthor-
ization of the Violence Against Women
Act makes that impossible for them.
Domestic violence survivors are cas-
ualties of this shutdown.
This weekend, I also met an entre-
preneur who is working to open a pet
care company with her husband. He
even left his job so they can realize
their dream, but they are currently
waiting on a Small Business Adminis-
tration loan they need to open their
business. It is sitting on a furloughed
worker’s desk. Entrepreneurs are cas-
ualties of the shutdown.
This week, I met with air traffic con-
trollers in my district, people who keep
passengers and freight moving safely

through the skies. They are working 6-
day weeks and about to miss a second
paycheck. They told me they look after
their colleagues by asking: How long
do you have left?
How long do they have left before
they miss a mortgage payment or a
healthcare bill, or max out their credit
cards?
These are hardworking, responsible
people, many with at least 3 months’
savings, but they are entering their
second month without a paycheck. The
financial and psychological stress of
this shutdown is cruel, and, sadly, it
won’t be the only consequence.
The shutdown has closed the air traf-
fic controller training academy, which
will diminish the pipeline of people we
need to keep air travel safe and effi-
cient in the future. Our future is a cas-
ualty of the Trump shutdown.
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope our
Republican colleagues will join us in
reopening the government. The alter-
native is too painful for too many.
Ms. PINGREE. I thank the gentle-
woman very much for her thoughts.
I am now happy to yield to my friend
from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER).
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I thank my friend from Maine. This
subject is so serious and so infuriating
because it is absurd.
We have shut down our government—
we are the only country in the world
that does something like this—inflict-
ing harm on our employees, on Ameri-
cans, and on America.
I see we have the gentlewoman from
Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER) in the
Chamber. She talked about national se-
curity being placed at risk. The fact
that we have done this to ourselves is
really difficult, and I would say to the
President, Madam Speaker, that it is
time to reopen this government.
We have offered 11 versions of how to
reopen the government. But I want to
talk about some stories, because the
psychological effect that the gentle-
woman from Maine talked about really
has an impact on these employees.
I want to talk about a young man
who works for the National Park Serv-
ice. He is in the natural resource tech-
nical division, so what he does is he
goes to the national parks and deals
with faults and different kinds of geo-
logical problems that may exist. They
work throughout the year, but particu-
larly at the time when their parks are
not very crowded. This is something
that is very important.
He has worked for the Park Service
for 19 years, and then, all of a sudden,
he believes that nobody saw this com-
ing, and he is furloughed, with young
children.
And he described it as this:
I don’t know when we are going to get back
to normal. Everything is on hold. It just
sucks. The mental side is crushing. I am sad;
I am angry; I am demoralized. And this sit-
ting around, just twiddling your thumbs,
hoping that the greatest Nation on Earth
opens back up for business, eats away at my
soul.
He has a brother-in-law who works
for the Border Patrol. He is an EMT
and a field agent with four children. He
is a first responder not getting paid.
b 1730
And this gentleman, we ask him to
provide border security, and he is not
getting paid, and he is under the pres-
sure of having a young family that
needs these paychecks and needs sta-
bility and reliability.
We had folks from Fish and Wildlife
that came in and talked to us, they
deal with aquatic and invasive species,
like the zebra mussel, which really can
gum up water systems throughout the
country.
There was a big conference between
Canada and the western United States
that got canceled when, in fact, we
should be making sure these rivers and
our waterways are in good shape. They
are getting affected.
There are so many things. We talk
about the front-facing individuals that
talk to the public, the TSA, the FBI,
those individuals, but we have so many
other employees who provide service to
each and every one of us that are ei-
ther working without pay or have been
furloughed without any end in sight.
This is no way to run a nation. We
know that. The absurdity of all of this
is really taking hold, and it is time for
us to open this government. This can
be resolved quickly, Mr. President.
Let’s just get this government open,
and then let’s sit down and negotiate
all of this.
Ms. PINGREE. I thank the gen-
tleman for taking the time to share
those stories with us. It is so important
that everybody understand the impact
this is having in many areas that most
people don’t know anything about.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOL-
LUM).
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from Maine for
organizing this.
Madam Speaker, right now, millions
of Americans all across this country
are struggling, and they are uncertain
about the future because of a govern-
ment shutdown.
Federal employees, government con-
tractors and their families, they are all
hurting. Small businesses, nonprofits,
State and local governments, they are
feeling the pain, and they know they
cannot count on Congress and the Fed-
eral Government as a reliable partner.
So who is at fault for this irrespon-
sible, negligent, and dangerous shut-
down? President Trump and the Repub-
licans.
They are demanding a wall, a wall
the Republican majority refused to
fund for 2 years, and they are willing to
inflict pain on millions of Americans,
damage our economy, and put our Na-
tion at risk to get their way, all so the
President can keep a campaign prom-
ise.
Mr. Trump and the Republicans in
Congress have taken 800,000 Federal
workers hostage, and for them to get
back to work and get paid, the ransom
demand is Trump’s wall.
Last week, I met with over 40 Federal
employees, air traffic controllers, TSA
agents, prison guards, all forced to
work without pay. I met with Federal
workers from HUD, and the IRS, and
the Agriculture Department, who are
furloughed and without pay. They are
struggling. They feel betrayed by their
government. They feel betrayed by
their President.
Tomorrow, these valued workers will
miss their second paycheck. They are
hurting. They feel desperate. Their
families are hurting, and they feel
afraid. They are being treated like
pawns by this President, and it is just
outright cruel.
House Democrats have passed appro-
priation bills 10 times to fund and im-
mediately open the government, but
Republicans keep voting ‘‘no.’’
It is time for Congress and Demo-
crats to vote to open the government
and to end this shutdown. Then we can
negotiate the details of comprehensive
border security and immigration re-
form with the government open.
Every Federal worker, on the job or
at home, I want you to know, you are
valued for your service and your con-
tribution to the safety and security
and to the success of our Nation. You
deserve to be treated with respect. You
deserve to get paid immediately.
And the one way that we can collec-
tively thank them for their service is
to open the government now.
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for sharing
those stories.
I yield to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. PERLMUTTER).
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker,
I want to talk about Tom, who is a 32-
year Federal employee and works as an
agricultural statistician. He calculates
how many cattle are in the western
United States and how many acres of
hay and crop that we have.
This is his fourth government shut-
down. He loves his job and his work. He
loves serving our country. But he feels
like these political games have become
an insult, and he is tired of being used
as a pawn.
I have many more stories, but I see
that the gentleman from Maryland is
ready to go and I yield back to the gen-
tlewoman from Maine so that she can
yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I
thank everyone here tonight for pro-
viding the diversity of stories that are
really coming from States across the
country which we all represent. And I
know it is just a small bit of what we
are all hearing every day in our offices.
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. RASKIN).
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I
thank Ms. PINGREE and Mr. PERL-
MUTTER for their leadership.
I welcome all questions from you
guys and any other colleagues here,
and from any Republicans present.
Anybody who wants to pose a question
to me, I am all for it.

re-election campaign adviser, recently
had a message for the furloughed work-
ers and people working without pay. It
will all be worth it, she assures us.
‘‘Listen, it’s not fair to you, and we all
get that; but this is so much bigger
than any one person,’’ she said in an
interview with ‘‘Bold TV’’. ‘‘It is a lit-
tle bit of pain, but it’s going to be for
the future of our country.’’
No, this is not a little bit of pain. A
little bit of pain is losing your earring
at the White House Christmas party.
That is a little bit of pain.
This is a lot of pain that the Amer-
ican people are experiencing right now.
It is day 34, and tens of thousands of
my constituents are suffering because
of the shutdown. Military veteran air
traffic controllers in Frederick County
are being forced to work with no pay,
and having to borrow money from their
kids’ 529 college accounts, with a 10
percent penalty, in order to put food on
the table and to pay their mortgage.
FDA workers living in Bethesda sent
home from the job with no pay, when
they are supposed to be keeping our
food supply safe from E. coli, sal-
monella and insect infestation.
Dozens of scientists, researchers, sec-
retaries, technicians, park rangers, IT
workers, all thrust into a nightmare of
closed offices, closed daycare, no gross
pay, no net pay, and a suffering econ-
omy.
There are thousands of private con-
tract employees in my district, Madam
Speaker, who have not earned a dollar
in a month, and they are never going
to get repaid for it.
There are Uber drivers telling me
they are making one-third of what
they usually make because our re-
gional economy is depressed in Mary-
land, Virginia, and D.C., because of the
government shutdown. And we know
that that is symptomatic of what is
going on across the country, because
more than 80 percent of Federal work-
ers don’t live in the national capital re-
gion.
One of my constituents has been a
Federal employee for 27 years, first in
the Interior Department, and then in
the National Park Service, who says:
‘‘This is the first time that I’ve had to
question whether I made the right
choice in public service, and the first
time I’ve had to reach into my retire-
ment funds to make sure that my wife
and I can pay our bills as they come
due this week and next.’’
He describes fellow Park Service em-
ployees living lives of quiet despera-
tion. And of course they would be, be-
cause they are being maligned and
typecast by the President of the United
States, who derides all of the Federal
workers as Democrats. He says they’re
all Democrats.
Well, first of all, it is not true. But
what difference does it make? They are
Americans.
We used to have Presidents of the
United States who stood with all
Americans, not with those from a par-
ticular political party, not just with
those who agreed with the President or
showed blind loyalty to the President.
We used to have Presidents who were
loyal to the American people and to
our Constitution.
‘‘All are suffering,’’ my constituent
writes, ‘‘mostly silently, not looking
for pity, but just for Congress and the
White House to do their job.’’
Now, we might think this shutdown
is some kind of freak outburst by an
admittedly erratic and impetuous
President. But, Madam Speaker, I rep-
resent tens of thousands of Federal
workers, and I am afraid that there is
a method to this madness, and I know
what it is; because I was there in Janu-
ary 2017 when the President issued an
executive order freezing all Federal
hiring, demoralizing, and even crip-
pling agencies throughout our govern-
ment.
I was there when they adopted, in
January of 2017, the Holman Rule, giv-
ing Congress the power to reduce Fed-
eral workers’ salaries, and even abolish
their positions, simply by slipping rid-
ers into appropriations bills.
I watched them try to ban the use of
the words ‘‘climate change’’ by Federal
scientists in official documents. And I
saw them propose hundreds of billions
of dollars in cuts to Federal workers’
wages and health benefits.
I saw the President, in September of
last year, announce his decision to re-
scind modest, across-the-board, statu-
tory pay increases and locality pay in-
creases of 1.9 percent for the Federal
workforce. And I have watched them
try to bust the Federal worker unions
by making it easier to fire Federal em-
ployees and trying to undo the existing
collective bargaining contracts, a se-
ries of moves that were fought by the
AFGE and NTEU and were finally re-
versed in court.
Madam Speaker, the original polit-
ical philosopher of this administration,
Steve Bannon, told us very clearly
what was the principal and overriding
political aim of this administration
when he essentially declared war on
our government and its workforce.
He stated at the outset of the admin-
istration that the new administration
is in an unending battle for a
deconstruction of the administrative
state. ‘‘Every day it is going to be a
fight,’’ he said. And by the administra-
tive state, he means my constituents,
who are working to protect our air,
protect our water, protect our planet
and the climate at the EPA, at NOAA,
and throughout the Federal Govern-
ment.
He means the civil servants at the
Department of Justice who are pros-
ecuting mobsters and white collar
criminals; the IRS agents who are try-
ing to catch tax scofflaws and collect
money so we have a government.
He means the people at NOAA who
are trying to save us from the horrors
of ocean acidification, the collapse of
the glaciers, and the cataclysmic
weather events that have overtaken us
in the age of global warming.
He means the hardworking scientists
and researchers at the NIH who are
working to cure colon cancer and
breast cancer, cystic fibrosis, and mul-
tiple sclerosis, and even malignant nar-
cissistic personality disorder.
Madam Speaker, does America recog-
nize what is happening to us? We have
a President who has essentially de-
clared war on our own government, on
our own civil servants. This is a com-
plete betrayal of the oath of office. He
is sworn to uphold and defend the law,
not to frustrate and thwart it.
The first paragraph of the Constitu-
tion creates a covenant to form a more
perfect union, but the President has
given us the longest shutdown in
American history. He is driving a
wedge through the union.
To establish justice. But they have
defunded the Department of Justice.
To ensure domestic tranquility, but
the Department of Homeland Security
is not being funded and our Border Pa-
trol agents are being forced to work
with no pay.
To provide for the common defense,
but our Coast Guard officers have been
held hostage, along with the rest of the
Federal workforce.
To promote the general welfare, but
800,000 Federal workers are being
forced to work with no pay, or sent
home from jobs that the American peo-
ple desperately want them to do.
And to secure the blessings of liberty
to ourselves and our posterity, but, in-
stead, we are now threatening to be-
queath to our children a dysfunctional
government, degraded regulatory ca-
pacity to clean our air and water, a
chaotic and unequal economy, and a
comprehensive climate disaster.
And who wins? Who benefits? Who
profits from it?
Well, we know it is not the American
people. The overwhelming number of
American people in every poll says
open up the government right now. Put
the Federal workers back to work.
And it is not the Federal workforce,
which has been put through hell over
the last month. It is not the business
community, which is suffering. It is
none of us who are benefiting, because
the whole economy is hurting.
But Donald Trump has a profound ad-
miration for autocrats and kleptocrats,
tyrants and dictators all over the
world. Putin in Russia, Orban in Hun-
gary, Duterte in the Philippines, the
homicidal Crown Prince of Saudi Ara-
bia, Mohammed bin Salman. All of
these are the heroes of the President,
and it must be a delicious sight for
them to see as the President disman-
tles the government of our own coun-
try.
They don’t shut down the govern-
ment in Russia. They are not shutting
down the government in Hungary.
They are not shutting down the gov-
ernment in the Philippines, but he has
shut down our own government.
Who wins? Who benefits from this
outrageous and scandalous offense
against America?

Well, it is not a partisan issue. I
think the American people are increas-
ingly unified every day against this
horror.
And now we had the first great Re-
publican President, Abraham Lincoln,
who unified America by working to
save the Union and defend the govern-
ment.
And now we have got a Republican
President who is driving a wedge
through the Union, and has closed the
government down. Will that be his leg-
acy? Will this disgraceful offense
against our Constitution and govern-
ment be the legacy of this President?
Or will, somehow, someone get to the
President and tell him that our people
are hurting? It is not a little bit of
pain.
b 1745
And I know they can’t understand
why Federal workers are going to food
banks. Then they should come on out
to the food banks. I invite them to
come join me at the food banks in my
district where I have been going. You
will meet lots of Federal workers and
their families there, because in this
economy there are a lot of people who
are living from paycheck to paycheck,
and tomorrow, that is two paychecks
that people have missed, and they have
missed them in the course of not doing
the jobs that America needs them to
do.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ms.
PINGREE for yielding this time, and I
just urge all of our colleagues on both
sides of the aisle and the President to
please let America get back to work,
and to open the government imme-
diately.
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Maryland
for his comments.
I know it is particularly challenging
in a district where so many people are
close to Washington and so many Fed-
eral employees have a multitude of
challenges. So I appreciate the gentle-
man’s good work and his thoughts.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL),
my friend and colleague.
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with
over 800,000 Federal workers and con-
tractors who are dramatically im-
pacted by the shameful and irrespon-
sible government shutdown. I rise
today to share the stories of those Fed-
eral workers in my district, Alabama’s
Seventh Congressional District.
This shutdown is impacting every-
one. I had the pleasure, recently, of
going through the Montgomery airport
and the Birmingham airport in my dis-
trict. It was Martin Luther King Day,
and everybody was trying to be upbeat,
but, you know, it is really hard to be
upbeat when you miss a paycheck. It is
hard to be upbeat when you have bills
to pay and you don’t know how you are
going to make ends meet.
We celebrated Martin Luther King’s
birthday on Monday, and it was Dr.
King who said: ‘‘Injustice anywhere is
a threat to justice everywhere.’’
Well, Madam Speaker, it is a threat
to justice that people work without
pay in this country, in America. It is
an injustice that they are about to
miss the second paycheck.
It is unacceptable that we are not
doing our job so that the people who
are working without pay can get paid.
We have to do better. We must reopen
government. Enough is truly enough.
Today, my staff delivered food to the
Federal Bureau of Prisons in Aliceville,
Alabama, in Pickens County, to the
hundreds of workers who work there
every day and who have not gotten
paid in 35 days. They did so out of serv-
ice.
But do you know what? We, out of
obligation, must open up this govern-
ment so that everyone who is working
gets paid, all those who are furloughed
can go back to work.
We know the importance of dignity
of a job. These are hardworking Fed-
eral workers and contractors who de-
serve to get paid. Why are we holding
them hostage? Why are their pay-
checks held hostage all for a wall?
I want to be clear, Madam Speaker:
We Democrats believe in border secu-
rity, but we want effective border secu-
rity.
I do not believe in spending $5.7 bil-
lion for a wall when people in my dis-
trict, babies in my district, go to bed
hungry, when there are people in my
district who need basic water and
sewer in Lowndes County and Pickens
County and in Perry County, Alabama.
I will stand up and fight for all those
in my district, and I stand in solidarity
with my Federal workers and contrac-
tors. They deserve to get paid.
I had an opportunity to talk with a
young TSA worker from Birmingham,
Alabama, just on Tuesday. I pass
through that airport once a week going
to and fro to D.C.
This young worker, with a smile on
her face, said: How are you this morn-
ing? Can I help you?
I said: How can I help you? I want
you to know that we are working hard
every day to open up government.
She said: I know that. I know that
you are. I also know that you know
that a wall will not make the dif-
ference.
You know, the sad irony is that so
many of these Federal workers don’t
have savings. She told me that she was
just happy to have a job with the Fed-
eral Government, to have the security
of having a Federal job is what she
said.
She also told me that right now
things are okay because she has her
mother to take care of her child. She
can no longer afford to send her child
to daycare and put gas in her car to
drive to the Birmingham airport to
work at 4 a.m., that first shift, but she
does it. She does it as long as she can.
We have to stand on this floor and
demand that we reopen government as
long as we can, as long as they have
not gotten their paychecks. It is un-
fair. It is an injustice. It is an injus-
tice.
So today, many of my congressional
staff are with those correctional offi-
cers in Aliceville, Alabama.
We heard the story of Heather Bry-
ant, who is struggling to pay for the
gas she needs to drive the 30 minutes to
work.
You see, in this small community of
Aliceville, Alabama, the Federal wom-
en’s correctional facility is the major
employer. It is the major employer in
that city, in that county.
I want you to know that because, in
the 35 days that these corrections offi-
cers, parole officers, prison workers
have gone without pay, we have seen
restaurants close. We have seen con-
venience stores reduce hours in that
community. Indeed, in order for us to
provide meals today, we had to reopen
that Meat and Three diner in order to
feed these workers today.
This is unacceptable because it is not
just the Federal workers who are im-
pacted; it is the collateral damage that
is done to the communities around this
country. Store owners, restaurant own-
ers who depend upon those workers for
their livelihoods are affected.
We must do something now. It is un-
fair for us to ask those folks who are
furloughed to come back to work and
not get paid. It is unfair and unjust for
us to ask Federal workers who are
working hard every day in our airports,
in our prison systems all across this
Nation to work without pay.
But as Martin Luther King also said:
‘‘The time is always right to do what is
right.’’
What is right, Madam Speaker, is to
reopen government now. We must
stand with these Federal workers. We
must unabashedly demand that they
get paid, and we must seek ways to
work across the aisle to get govern-
ment open.
But they have to also offer an olive
branch. This President hasn’t done
that. Instead, he has put his interests
over the American people’s interests.
Enough is enough. We must reopen
government and let our Federal work-
ers, our contractors, know that we
stand in solidarity with them.
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I
thank Ms. SEWELL from Alabama for
being here tonight.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY).
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
I really appreciate the opportunity to
come down and talk.
Our colleague from Alabama was
talking about Martin Luther King, who
also talked about the urgency of now.
If there is a time for urgency, it is now
to end the shutdown and pay the work-
ers.
He also talked about and warned
about that, if you wait too long, it can
be too late. So this is the time to spare
what is a growing disaster for all
Americans from happening.

Wilbur Ross, our Commerce Sec-
retary, said that he doesn’t quite un-
derstand why these furloughed and un-
paid workers might have to go to a
food bank. He doesn’t understand.
That is exemplary of the level at
which this administration is com-
pletely tone-deaf and out of touch, that
they don’t understand how people—the
beginning salary for a TSA worker at
the airport is $28,000, and sometimes it
goes up to maybe $43,000. Tomorrow
will be the second paycheck that they
don’t get.
So a number of us in Chicago had a
roundtable that included eight Mem-
bers of the House of Representatives,
Democrats, and Senator DURBIN.
Madam Speaker right now in the chair
was at that roundtable. We heard from
18 different workers from different
agencies talking.
Wilbur Ross ought to talk to Flor-
ence, who is helping people get food
stamps and found herself having to
apply for food stamps, for the SNAP
program. She waited 3 hours at a food
bank. Why? Because the lines are grow-
ing and growing and growing of people
who, yes, need to get food on their ta-
bles and can’t afford to do it.
Shame on Secretary Ross for not un-
derstanding what is going on out there.
We are hearing of people giving blood
and plasma in order to have a few dol-
lars to put food on the table. We are
hearing about people running out of
gas money, and that means that they
can’t get to work. This is money that
comes out of their pocket while they
are not getting paychecks.
Madam Speaker, to MITCH MCCON-
NELL, who doesn’t want to call bills
that would actually get the govern-
ment going, I say: Shame on you.
Shame on you, Wilbur Ross. Shame on
this administration. This is a crisis.
This is a disaster that you are cre-
ating. You can end it.
So the demand is clear: End the shut-
down; pay the workers.
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman so much for
sharing that and for hosting a round-
table in her district.
Madam Speaker, I think every time
we have a chance to have people gather
to talk about this, at least they know
we are listening to them, even if we
haven’t fixed the problem.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO).
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from Maine for
hosting this.
First, I want to start by reading a
letter from one of my constituents,
Douglas Lowe, who is a professional
aviation safety specialist in my dis-
trict.
‘‘Dear Representative DARREN SOTO, I
am writing you with a heavy heart and
much stress as I live through this gov-
ernment shutdown. It has been the
longest we have ever faced, and as the
days continue, I am finding myself
more and more weakened by the situa-
tion.
‘‘I am the president for the Florida
Chapter of Professional Aviation Safe-
ty Specialists, PASS. We represent the
men and women that make aviation
across our Nation function in every as-
pect, from the aviation safety inspec-
tors, to people like myself who main-
tain complex equipment that makes
air traffic control possible, as well as a
multitude of support staff that deals
with logistics and contracts.
‘‘The main reason I am writing you is
to talk about the human factor. We
need to find a resolution. There must
be an end to this shutdown. Real people
are suffering. Many coworkers of mine
across the Nation, people I represent
have come to me with hardships. I per-
sonally have dealt with two individuals
already who have had to resign their
positions and move on with life.
‘‘We are going on day 34 now with no
end in sight. Men and women like my-
self have still been at work. Each day
makes that endeavor a little harder.
We struggle with when and how do we
keep coming to work and support the
system when we can no longer afford
gas. I personally have had to make
some sacrifices already. Friday the
25th is my daughter’s 18th birthday. I
have asked my daughter to please for-
give me, but we are not buying her
anything right now because we need to
budget and ensure we have money for
bills and food.
‘‘Also, I take care of my mother who
has schizophrenia. I have been relying
100 percent this past month on her
nurse to hold everything together be-
cause I cannot get over to see her. The
amount of stress and anxiety sur-
rounding these events is enormous. I
cannot ask enough that every Member
of Congress please think about those of
us caught in the middle of this fight.
‘‘Please consider our hardships and
find some common ground; find a road
forward. I still have faith in you, and
we are carrying the country on our
backs, but I do not know how much
longer we can endure.
‘‘I am a marine and a leader, so I
show a smile and I keep moving for-
ward, but I have already seen the
heartache and turmoil others have dis-
played, people crying, not knowing how
to make ends meet, professionals ap-
plying for food stamps and aid while
still being required to put in a 40-hour
workweek.’’
b 1800
‘‘This list goes on and on, but I be-
lieve the most disturbing fact is that
this is happening to people in the
United States of America. People are
being asked and forced to work for free,
threatened to completely lose their
livelihood if they do not show up. This
is something that I would expect from’’
a country that is developing. I won’t
use the exact words he used.
‘‘My fear is someone is going to be so
stressed that they miss a task. They
are going to be so fatigued that they
make a mistake, and, with the jobs
that we do, that mistake could lead to
the lives of thousands being lost. Avia-
tion safety is on the line, and each day,
each hour, each minute that we stay
shut down, more risk is injected into
our Nation’s aviation system.
‘‘Please, I beg you to reopen the gov-
ernment before something bad happens.
I continue to come to work because I
think of the children that may be fly-
ing into Orlando on a Make-A-Wish
Foundation flight. That child may
have cancer and be on their way to Dis-
ney for what may be the last days of
their lives. I come to work each day
without pay to make sure that those
children land safely. But as the weeks
turn into months for this shutdown, I
am fearful that even I will have a
breaking point.
‘‘Sincerely, Douglas Lowe, Profes-
sional Aviation Safety Specialists.’’
Now, I want to talk a little bit about
compromise throughout American his-
tory. There have been some great
American compromises that we have
seen in this Nation.
Starting at the very founding of our
Republic, in 1787, after we had to start
working on the Constitution, Con-
necticut delegates Roger Sherman and
Oliver Ellsworth drafted the Great
Compromise, a plan for congressional
representation. Without this, there
likely never would have been a Con-
stitution.
Many more compromises have fol-
lowed in political history, but imagine
what small States would face, and
large States would face, if they didn’t
have representation in the Senate and
in the House.
Then there was the Compromise of
1790 that was made famous by the now-
popular ‘‘Hamilton’’ musical. It was
the compromise by Alexander Ham-
ilton and Thomas Jefferson with James
Madison, where Hamilton won the deci-
sion for the national government to
take over, pay the debt, and create a
banking system, while Jefferson Madi-
son obtained a national capital, in the
District of Columbia that we stand in
right now, for the South. That was de-
scribed as ‘‘the room where it hap-
pens,’’ and I feel like we need another
room where it happens today.
But compromises aren’t always great
in American history. In the 19th cen-
tury, in particular, we had many exam-
ples. It was a dark time, for trying to
compromise on such moral crusades as
slavery and the Civil War. But I will
mention one of them.
In 1820, there was the Missouri Com-
promise, legislation that provided ad-
mission of the gentlewoman’s State,
Maine, a Free State, along with Mis-
souri, that, unfortunately, came in as a
slave State, thus maintaining the bal-
ance of power between the North and
the South in the United States.
One of the things I struggle with
right now is: What time are we in? Is
this a time where we need to com-
promise, and it will turn out to be one
of those terrible ones that America will
look back on, like that one? Or will it
be one of the ones that helped forge
ahead the Republic stronger than ever?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1203
January 24, 2019
In the 20th century, compromise
faired far better in American politics.
We saw, in 1917, the United States
came together to enter World War I,
even though we were still emerging as
a world power ourselves. We saved our
allies from destruction, turned the tide
of the war, and eventually emerged as
a major power.
Everything changed when we saw the
New Deal happen. Mostly Democrats,
with some Republicans, not enough of
them, came together to help make sure
that we would have major programs to
help put Americans back to work after
we had the stock market crash.
But it was on December 7, 1941, a day
that would live in infamy when Pearl
Harbor was bombed, that Democrats
and Republicans came together to join
in a fight against Nazi Germany and
the Japanese empire, to literally re-
write the rules of the world order that
we now live in today. We just, in fact,
reaffirmed this with a vote the other
day, affirming our support for NATO.
Compromise got even better as we
got into the sixties. In 1964, one of the
first civil rights bills, proposed by con-
gressional Democrats in the North and
opposed by Republican Senators, led to
one of the longest filibusters in Senate
history. Eventually, Majority Leader
Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, I be-
lieve, reached out to his Republican
counterpart, Senator Everett Dirksen,
to put an end to the debate, and the
bill passed 9 days later.
In 1977, we saw, finally, more regula-
tions and more teeth in the law to pro-
tect folks who were going hungry with
the Food Stamp Act. It was Republican
Bob Dole at the time—can you imagine
that later on?—along with Democratic
Senator George McGovern who joined
forces to support a bipartisan com-
promise back in 1987.
In 1986—we have heard so much about
the eighties—President Reagan and
Speaker Tip O’Neill were able to get
together to come up with major com-
promises. One was to save Social Secu-
rity for a future generation, in 1983 to
1986. Another in 1986 was a tax reform
bill that eventually came to a com-
promise.
This leads me to probably the most
relevant one for what we have today,
which is, in 2013, when a bipartisan im-
migration bill passed the Senate with
68 votes. It had comprehensive immi-
gration reform and included robust
border security.
So the big question that each Mem-
ber will have to ask in the Congress, in
the House, in the Senate, and the
President as well, is: What are we will-
ing to do to rise together? What sac-
rifices are we willing to make? What
compromises are we willing to wage?
What interests are we going to advance
to come together to put an end to the
longest shutdown in American history?
I can assure you, it is not going to be
easy. But I know that, if we all work
together, we can do it.
There is one thing in common with
all these compromises: none of them
required a government shutdown, not a
single one. We had some filibusters in
there, but not one of these major com-
promises in American history started
by a shutdown.
I think the first thing that we need
to do is reopen the government, not
hold our Federal workers hostage over
what needs to be a grand compromise
on policy, on immigration, on border
security.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Maine for allowing me to
have a few moments to talk about how
important it is, this moment in time,
and how every Member needs to step up
for the American people to end this
shutdown now.
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Florida for
reminding us of some important com-
promises. Some I liked, some I didn’t.
But were it not for the Missouri Com-
promise, we wouldn’t have Maine, so I
am glad about that one anyway.
Also, as you said, we can compromise
without holding hostage all of these
workers we have been talking about to-
night, without shutting down the gov-
ernment, and without shaking up peo-
ple’s lives. This is our challenge, to
work it out as Members of Congress, as
members of the executive branch. We
can’t ask our hardworking Federal em-
ployees to bear the brunt of all this.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.
CLARK), who is also the vice chair of
our Caucus. I thank her for being here
tonight and for fitting us into her busy
schedule.
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding and for holding this
important Special Order hour. It is so
important that we tell the stories of
the very real impact of this shutdown,
and I appreciate her giving us that op-
portunity.
I do want to share some of the stories
from my district.
We recently heard from Emily, who
is a TSA agent at Logan Airport and a
single mom of three. She hasn’t re-
ceived her paycheck. She won’t be get-
ting one tomorrow and is worried
about falling behind on rent and
childcare payments. She has to stay
current with childcare or she loses her
children’s spots. She said: ‘‘I don’t
know how I’m going to make this
work. If I don’t get paid, how can I af-
ford to send my children to daycare?’’
She has $400 left in her bank account.
Then there is Donna from Revere.
She has been employed at her job for
the last 22 years but doesn’t know
where her next meal will come from
without a paycheck to rely on. Donna
said: ‘‘I have to choose between buying
food or paying a bill.’’
We received a call from a retired Fed-
eral employee in Natick. She lives in
affordable housing and is required to
prove her income to renew her lease.
She cannot obtain a statement from
OPM regarding her pension because
they are closed, jeopardizing her living
situation.
Sandy called us. She owns a startup
in Cambridge that almost exclusively
contracts with DOD and DHS. This is a
small business, and they are struggling
to keep up with payroll as the checks
stopped coming. She said: ‘‘We have
about a week and a half of payroll
left.’’
David from Ashland is an Active
Duty Coast Guard member stationed in
Boston. I want to note that the com-
munity has come together to open a
food bank for our Coast Guard mem-
bers and their families. He doesn’t
know how he and his family are going
to continue to pay their bills.
The Coast Guard, certainly for coast-
al States and for our national security,
plays a critical role, not only in search
and rescue, and protection from ter-
rorism, but also in drug interdiction.
The fact that we are asking Coast
Guard members, who serve their coun-
try proudly and with great patriotism,
to work without pay is a national
shame.
Susan from Belmont receives a hous-
ing subsidy through HUD, and if the
shutdown continues, she is afraid she
could face the possibility of eviction.
We have heard from Amanda in Wal-
tham. Amanda is an Indian citizen who
has resided with legal status in the
U.S. for over 12 years, working for a
childcare provider. She, her husband,
and young son traveled to India in No-
vember to visit with family. At that
time, they went to the U.S. consulate
to get their visas stamped. Her hus-
band’s visa was issued right away, but
Amanda’s was subject to further re-
view. Having not received her visa, she
remains in India, separated from her
son and husband. The shutdown has de-
layed this processing further and has
prolonged the separation, which is a
significant hardship on this family.
These are just a few of the stories
that we have heard about what is the
real impact of this shutdown.
It is long past time that we open gov-
ernment. We can negotiate on what
real border security looks like, but it
shouldn’t be done at the expense of the
security of these families and of our
national security as well.
b 1815
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from Massa-
chusetts for sharing those stories,
which we are hearing throughout New
England, and are so challenging and
meaningful to all of us.
We have heard tonight from all re-
gions of the country: north, south,
east, and west, and so many of the sto-
ries are the same. We heard from fami-
lies affected by the fact that our Coast
Guard personnel are not being paid, the
only branch of the military that
doesn’t get paid.
This is a hardship not only on them,
but on their families as well who are
home trying to make ends meet when
they are off deployed; the TSA and the
FAA, which we depend on every single
day in our airports across the country

for our safety, for our security; people
who work in the Federal courts; people
who are not working, but are govern-
ment employees. They are not essen-
tial, so they are furloughed, but they
can’t go out and get another job in the
middle of all of this. They just have to
wait until it is all over to collect that
back pay.
There are so many contractors I hear
from who can’t continue with their
contracts, because maybe they work
with the Coast Guard or other Federal
agencies, and they can’t keep the fund-
ing going, and they can’t give any cer-
tainty to when jobs will be completed
or to their own employees.
I have a couple of minutes left and I
am going to read a long story, but it
might just take up exactly the right
amount of time.
We talk so much about all of the em-
ployees, but there are so many others
who are impacted by this, and, particu-
larly, in the agriculture sector in
Maine. We are very proud of our farm-
ers. We are very proud of seeing new,
young farmers getting into the busi-
ness, of farms being revived and finding
new markets.
This was a story from the Grace Pond
Farm in Thomaston. They shared their
story of how the USDA shutdown has
impacted them. They said: ‘‘We are
often a little removed from the issues
affecting others. We can sigh and re-
joice, cry and shake our fists at the air
with just a little bit of safe distance
from way up here; but not this time.
This shutdown affects everyone and
that everyone includes us.
‘‘We have planned, schemed and
dreamed our way onto this historic
farm property in Thomaston. Gregg
and I have spent countless late nights,
after catching chickens and milking
cows, staring at screens and numbers,
and putting together business plans
and spreadsheets to grow sustainably.
‘‘Our goal—to be able to just milk
cows, grow chickens and turkeys, feed
our kids and neighbors, and drive a car
that runs. Gregg grew up learning how
to enjoy dark mornings, working on a
dairy farm in rural Pennsylvania. I
grew up in central Maine, spending
mornings waiting for the Skehan’s
dairy truck and learning how to beat
my brother to the cream on top of that
glass bottle.
‘‘We want to ensure that both of
these experiences are available to our
kids, and to everyone in Maine, for
years to come.
‘‘Our farm is financed the old-fash-
ioned way—on a tightrope. We operate
on a faith-based budget, and that keeps
things exciting. The FSA and the
USDA rural development loans are val-
uable resources for poor folks that
want to work hard and eat well—and
we make good use of them.
‘‘About a year ago, with a shifting
dairy market impacting our current
situation, we poured ourselves into the
process of financing the new farm we’d
found to fit our needs.
‘‘Utilizing a community lender, we
managed to secure that property, and
relying on our faith-based budget, we
went for it. Thanks to CEI for taking
that chance on us. We also began the
laborious process of financing the dairy
infrastructure at the new property
using the FSA as our security lender,
because that’s what they do for us.
‘‘This is all contingent on our selling
the ‘old’ farm property—we cannot in
any way carry two farms. After grate-
fully securing a buyer for the ‘old’
farm, we were moments away from
closing when the government was shut
down. Just like that, we lost access to
our mortgage holder and all of the nec-
essary documentation and signatures
that they alone can provide.
‘‘Not only that, we were just a few
weeks away from the deadline for our
Maine DACF-based dairy loan, and
found ourselves suddenly without the
proof of security necessary. No skin in
the game equals no dairy loan.
‘‘We are now weeks past our closing.
We continue to accrue heating bills,
taxes, and mortgage interest on the
‘old’ farm property, while we pay all of
the same on the ‘new’ one. We had to
scramble to find another bridge loan
for the dairy infrastructure, and due to
the lender being anyone but the USDA,
the interest rate is more than 5 per-
centage points higher—this translates
to an annual number that made our
‘numbers guy’ take a few breaths be-
fore commenting when he heard the
news. We are thousands of dollars into
this shutdown now.
‘‘We operate on razor-thin margins.
We are not alone. The companies that
sell us grain, and chicks, and poults,
are all actual people, employing other
actual people, all operating on a faith-
based budget, trying to preserve a way
of life that we believe has value and
merit. We need an end to the shutdown
before we have to shut down and the
way life should be is that much more
lost to us all.’’
Madam Speaker, I thank all of my
colleagues for being here tonight and
thank everyone who shared their sto-
ries and allowed us to let you in on a
little bit of how this tragedy proceeds.
I encourage a negotiation and a settle-
ment.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND
STATUS OF WALL
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
UNDERWOOD). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN) for 30 min-
utes.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to address the current gov-
ernment shutdown and the status of
the government wall.
It is kind of a frustrating issue to ad-
dress, because there is so much misin-
formation out there. The first thing I
will address is the unpaid employees.
We can pay the unpaid employees, par-
ticularly the employees who are work-
ing, if we would pass a bill now. We do
not have to end this whole thing.
There is a wonderful bill, H.R. 271, in-
troduced by Congressman BROOKS—I
am a cosponsor—that will immediately
pay all of the current, working Federal
employees.
I do not have the power to put that
bill on the floor, because I am just a
regular Congressman from Wisconsin.
But the majority leader, if you see
him, could put that bill on the floor
any time. And if the real concern here
is for the Federal employees who work
in our airports, who work in the Coast
Guard, who work in our prisons—many
of whom I know and are great people—
if these people really cared about them,
that bill would be on the floor next
Tuesday and winging its way to Presi-
dent Trump’s desk by this time next
week.
It is a mystery to me why, when so
many politicians purport to care about
the Federal employees, they will not
bring forth this bill to pay them with-
out having the whole issue solved.
The next issue I am going to address
is these people who say President
Trump cannot compromise. I don’t
know whether they haven’t been pay-
ing attention the last 2 years, or
whether they just love to make things
up.
For the public to understand, under
normal circumstances if we are going
to build a wall, the wall is in what we
call an appropriation bill, or what peo-
ple back home would refer to as a budg-
et. President Trump ran on the wall,
and the wall is necessary, and we will
talk about that in a second. Neverthe-
less, President Trump would have
wanted funding for this wall in some
budget.
For his first 2 years, President
Trump was sent budgets by Congress,
or spending bills by Congress, that did
not contain a wall. That was frus-
trating to him, but because he did not
want to shut down the government,
and did not want to penalize the gov-
ernment employees, President Trump,
particularly, with a big omnibus bill
about a year ago, signed big spending
bills without a wall because he com-
promised.
You will recall that originally people
talked about this wall being $20 billion.
President Trump is now asking for $5.7
billion. In the last week, I have taken
time to meet with the former head of
the Border Patrol. I have been on the
Arizona border, and it disappoints the
experts in the field, the people on the
border themselves, that Donald Trump
has compromised so much as to want
only funding for a fraction of the wall.
So I would say, coming down from $20
billion to $5.7 billion is a big com-
promise. I would say twice signing en-
tire appropriations for his first 2 years
in office without the wall, is a big com-
promise by President Trump.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1205
January 24, 2019
President Trump, last Saturday, also
decided to extend DACA, and decided
to extend temporary protected status
on people. Now, what I found out from
listening to the Border Patrol is that
when you talk about DACA, insofar as
the President talks about it, it encour-
ages more people to come here from
south of the border because they will
assume DACA is a permanent thing,
and that more and more people will be
added to it.
But, despite the fact that it might
have been irresponsible to talk about
DACA and extending it again, Presi-
dent Trump, in an effort to com-
promise, decided to throw these other
policy items in the mix on Saturday.
I sometimes slip, instead of calling
President Trump the Commander in
Chief, I call him the compromiser in
chief, because he has given so much to
twice sign annual bills without funding
for the wall and asked for funding for
only a fraction of the wall.
When I was down on the border, I saw
places where the wall needed exten-
sions. President Trump is not asking
for enough money for the extensions
that the Border Patrol needs. But in
the interest of compromise, President
Trump has asked for $5.7 billion. I will
talk in a second about how much
money that is. I know for me, $5.7 bil-
lion is a huge amount of money. But
let’s talk about what other people are
willing to vote on around here.
Madam Speaker, $5.7 billion for the
wall is about one-seventh of what we
spend every year on foreign aid. I never
hear Congressmen come up here and
rail against all the money we are
spending on foreign aid and how we
could do wonderful things if we only
kept that money at home. But all of a
sudden, with one-seventh of the cost of
foreign aid, we have a battery of people
on the other side of the aisle saying we
could do so many better things with
that money, when in the wink of an
eye, they are going to pass appropria-
tion bills spending seven times that
much, year, after year, after year, after
year on foreign aid.
President Trump greatly increased
the defense budget—more than I would
have liked. I complained about it a lit-
tle bit. The funding for the wall would
be about one-twelfth of the increase—
not the total budget—the increase in
the defense budget under President
Trump.
Again, I objected. Almost nobody
around here, however, objected to this
large increase in the defense budget.
But now it comes to the wall, and all of
a sudden, they can’t bring themselves
to vote for it.
Is this a crisis? You bet it is a crisis.
Like I said, I was down on the border
last week in Sasabe, Arizona. First of
all, we have a huge cost to the govern-
ment at the border. People are coming
across the border using our medical fa-
cilities. The Governor of California has
outright said he will be happy to have
all of the immigrants. I guess every-
body in the Western Hemisphere can
come to California and have the gov-
ernment, which to a certain extent
means the Federal Government, pay
for medical costs.
Madam Speaker, 90 percent of the
heroin comes across the southern bor-
der. Now, you hear people say that
most of that is at selected points of
entry. But the reason most of the her-
oin comes in at selected points of entry
is because we are not catching vir-
tually anybody between the points of
entry. They are just walking in where
there is no wall.
I don’t know—given the huge number
of people who die of heroin every
year—that we can say that not putting
walls in the gaps in the current system
is not something that is necessary and
not something that we need to do to
solve that heroin crisis.
There are a lot of parts of that heroin
crisis, but when that amount of heroin
is coming across south of the border,
part of the answer is to complete the
wall.
We are getting more and more chil-
dren on our border. What is going on
right now, so people understand, is par-
ents are sending their children to the
border. And if the children come to the
border, which is all the easier, because
they may have somebody escort them
to the border, we will take those chil-
dren and deliver them to a relative
around the country.
I would say if a child is taking the
hazardous trek, albeit helped along the
way, to come to the United States, and
the parents are sending the children
with somebody who may not be their
relative, sending their children because
once the children are here, the children
can say they are living in America, and
the parents can come here under the
family rules and join them; it is a huge
crisis.
Other people coming and trying to
get between the points of entry are fre-
quently found dying. I have been told—
I haven’t confirmed it—that in the
Tucson sector alone, in the last 15 or 16
years, over 2,000 people have been found
dead of dehydration, starvation, and
what have you. That is what you call a
humanitarian crisis.
b 1830
The overall cost on our overburdened
government—different people can
argue how much illegal immigrants
cost this country. The Heritage Foun-
dation—some people may not agree
with them—feels it is over $50 billion a
year.
Madam Speaker, when it is costing
us $50 billion a year between the
healthcare costs, the welfare costs, the
education costs, and the criminal jus-
tice costs, how can you not spend $5.7
billion to begin to solve this crisis?
The next thing to address, it is some-
times said, and people say it to my
right, that everybody wants to do
something about the border. I question
that, given what other people are say-
ing.
It may surprise Americans out there
to know that there are a lot of people
out there who buy into the idea that
the United States can be kind of like
Europe and we can have open borders
and everybody can walk wherever they
want.
How do we know this? All around the
country we have sanctuary cities in
which mayors or sanctuary counties in
which county executives or, in the case
of California, a whole State in which
local officials are forbidden to ask peo-
ple whether they are here legally or
not. The only explanation for that is
Americans are electing people around
the country who do not believe in bor-
ders and who are perfectly happy to
have tens of millions of people come
across our southern border, some good,
some not so good.
But, obviously, these people do not
believe in border security. If you be-
lieve in border security, Madam Speak-
er, the Governor of California would
not be openly inviting everybody to
come to California for free medical
care.
It is clear that a lot of people out
there do not want a closed border.
Another piece of evidence for that,
Madam Speaker, is you have Members
of Congress saying we should get rid of
ICE and get rid of immigration en-
forcement. People who publicly say we
should get rid of immigration enforce-
ment—even though it is a preposterous
idea, of course—border security is not a
priority for them. They are the type of
people who, on examining the situa-
tion, can see no reason why we cannot
accept 5, 10, 15, or 20 million other ille-
gal immigrants across the border.
By the way, one other thing I found
out talking to Border Patrol is nobody
knows exactly how many illegal immi-
grants are in the country. Madam
Speaker, you sometimes heard it said
11 million, 12 million. It could be 15
million, or it could be 20 million. We
really aren’t counting, and the people
on the border, Border Patrol them-
selves, will admit that they don’t know
how many people are coming across the
border.
Now, Madam Speaker, the next thing
you hear is: Oh, I care about border se-
curity. I just don’t believe in the wall.
Why don’t I believe that? I don’t be-
lieve that they really care about border
security because walls work.
Now, behind me, I have pictures of
four parts of a wall in other parts of
the world.
Here we have a wonderful wall which
cut illegal immigration by over 90 per-
cent in the San Diego-Tijuana area.
That wall works.
I was in Nogales, Arizona. Here is a
wall that was recently refurbished, and
that wall works. Unfortunately, as you
will notice, the wall ends, and the Bor-
der Patrol and the ranchers who live
near this area, one of whom I recently
talked to, said all of a sudden MS–13
showed up and they had to give them
dinner at the ranch. These people des-
perately want this wall to be extended
a little bit.
Here we have more wall in Sasabe,
Arizona.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1206 January 24, 2019
Here we have a wall that has cut ille-
gal immigration down to almost noth-
ing in Israel.
I was not able to find a wall, which
has also been successful—I have got to
get a picture. We will be back next
week with a picture of a wall between
Jordan and Syria.
Madam Speaker, you might say: Why
are you talking about a wall between
Jordan and Syria? Because a lot of that
wall was paid for by the United States.
Now, why did the United States have
no problem funding a wall in San Diego
or a wall in Sasabe or upgrading the
wall in Nogales? Many of my col-
leagues on the right side of me here
had no problem voting for these walls.
But there is something different about
these walls from the walls President
Trump wants. These walls were pro-
posed by somebody other than Presi-
dent Trump.
When it was President Clinton pro-
posing to build a wall in San Diego,
people didn’t say it was immoral to
have a wall.
When President Obama was extend-
ing or upgrading the wall in Nogales,
Arizona, people didn’t say: ‘‘President
Obama is an immoral person. Walls
look bad.’’ You never even heard about
it. I didn’t know about it until a couple
weeks ago.
When you have a wall going up in
Sasabe, which desperately has to be ex-
tended, that wall was built under
President Bush, under appropriation
bills, and not a peep. Nobody said it
was immoral when President Bush
built a wall.
So, Madam Speaker, now we get
down to, I reluctantly conclude, be-
cause I have to wonder when you have
these other successful walls around the
world, when we have no problem voting
for walls for Jordan for goodness’ sake,
why, all of a sudden in this large budg-
et—and every budget has things in it
we don’t like. Why, all of a sudden, do
we go through all this heartburn, put
all these Federal employees through fi-
nancial distress, why do we do it when,
in the past, we have built walls all the
time? I have to conclude, sadly, part of
it is some people want President
Trump to fail.
The fact that not building a wall
means all that much more heroin
across the border, it means many more
people sneaking across the border or
escorted across the border by the Mexi-
can cartels—and, by the way, today the
Mexican cartels run the border.
So to come in this country means
you are hostage for awhile to the Mexi-
can cartels, which may be one of the
reasons why they don’t do a very good
job of protecting the women down
there. It is why it can be very expen-
sive for people. It is why people who
try to escort you across the border who
aren’t a member of the cartel, if they
are caught, will be killed and, appar-
ently, in some cases, skinned alive. But
we don’t want to stop the current situ-
ation.
Again, the folks back home will have
to wonder: Why can people build a wall
in Jordan, why can we let President
Clinton build a wall in San Diego
which is very effective, why can we let
President Bush build a wall, why can
we let President Obama upgrade our
walls, but all of a sudden, President
Trump becomes President and we have
to have a shutdown because we can’t
vote for a budget with a wall in it?
I have voted for spending bills under
chief executives who were Democrats
and Republicans, and I usually agree
with the Republicans, but it never oc-
curred to me to vote against a spending
bill because I didn’t like other policies
of the chief executive.
So here we have it, Madam Speaker.
We will refresh your memory one more
time: walls work. They work in Israel;
they work in San Diego; and they work
in Nogales.
We have paid for many walls both in
this country and in other countries;
and other countries build walls, and
they are successful.
If we do not build a wall, we will con-
tinue to have people starve as they try
to come in here inappropriately. We
will continue to have bad people come
across the border who commit crimes.
We will continue to have people come
across the border who are here for our
generous welfare benefits.
This is something that didn’t occur
to me until I got down to the border
and talked to Customs. They said that,
when you look in people’s wallets and
you look in people’s purses, they find
food stamps—EBT cards—in those
purses. In other words, people are com-
ing here to get our welfare benefits.
It would be much better if we com-
pleted the wall and funneled people
through the normal entry points so we
could keep some of the criminal ele-
ment out of the country, so we could
keep people who are coming here just
to take advantage of our generous med-
ical systems—all with Federal dollars
going into this that our Governor of
California and mayor of New York are
so eager to give away—so we can solve
this crisis.
All it takes is somebody to be willing
to pass a budget, a budget that is too
free-spending otherwise, by the way. I
don’t like all the excessive spending in
the budget, but every budget is a com-
promise, and we are willing to build
the wall.
I hope, in the interim, that my col-
leagues who at least are pretending
now to care about the Federal employ-
ees will bring a separate bill to the
floor, which they can do at any time. A
wonderful bill, H.R. 271, MO BROOKS, a
great guy, bring that bill to the floor
so we can pay the Coast Guard, we can
pay the guys and gals working in the
Federal prisons, and we can pay the
TSA guys. So, Madam Speaker, even if
you don’t feel like spending anything
on the wall today, at least they can get
paid for the work they are doing.
Madam Speaker, you are crying croc-
odile tears if you do not cosponsor
those bills and bring those bills to the
floor but then claim that you have
sympathy for the Federal employees.
We do not have to solve the other
issues to get these people paid.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

committees so far as applicable, except that
a motion to recess from day to day, and a
motion to dispense with the first reading (in

are available, is a non-debatable motion of
high privilege in the Committee.
Each subcommittee of the Committee is
part of the Committee and is subject to the
authority and direction of the Committee
and to its rules so far as applicable. Written
rules adopted by the Committee, not incon-

items enumerated above.
Within 60 days of the conclusion of any of-
ficial travel authorized under this rule, there

Chairman a written report covering the in-
formation gained as a result of the hearing,
meeting, conference, facility inspection or

ignate a select panel of the Committee to in-
quire into and take testimony on matters of
special national interest. Any such panel
shall be subject to all Committee rules here-
in and shall not have legislative jurisdiction.
Any select panel designated under this rule
shall continue in existence for six months
after the date of the designation and may be
reauthorized in the discretion of the Chair
for subsequent six month terms.
RULE 10. EX-OFFICIO MEMBERS OF
SUBCOMMITTEES
The Chairman of the full Committee and
the Ranking Minority Member may sit as ex-
officio Members of all Subcommittees. They
may be counted for purposes of assisting in
the establishment of a quorum for a Sub-
committee. However, their absence shall not
count against the establishment of a quorum
by the regular Members of the Sub-
committee. Ex-officio Members shall neither
vote in the Subcommittee nor be taken into
consideration for the purposes of deter-
mining the ratio of the Subcommittee.
RULE 11. SUBCOMMITTEE MEETINGS
Insofar as practicable, meetings of the full
Committee and its Subcommittees shall not
conflict. Subcommittee Chairmen shall set
meeting dates after consultation with the
Chairman of the full Committee and other
Subcommittee Chairmen with a view to-
wards avoiding, wherever possible, simulta-
neous scheduling of full Committee and Sub-
committee meetings or hearings.
RULE 12. REFERENCE OF LEGISLATION AND
SUBCOMMITTEE REPORTS
Except for bills or measures retained by
the Chairman of the full Committee for full
Committee consideration, every bill or other
measure referred to the Committee shall be
referred by the Chairman of the full Com-
mittee to the appropriate Subcommittee in a
timely manner.
No measure reported by a Subcommittee
shall be considered by the full Committee
unless it has been presented to all Members
of the full Committee at least two legislative
days prior to the full Committee’s meeting,
together with a comparison with present
law, a section-by-section analysis of the pro-
posed change, a section-by-section justifica-
tion, and a draft statement of the budget ef-
fects of the measure that is consistent with
the requirements for reported measures
under clause 3(d)(1) of Rule XIII of the Rules
of the House of Representatives.
RULE 13. RECOMMENDATION FOR APPOINTMENT
OF CONFEREES
Whenever in the legislative process it be-
comes necessary to appoint conferees, the
Chairman of the full Committee shall rec-
ommend to the Speaker as conferees the
names of those Committee Members as the
Chairman may designate. In making rec-
ommendations of Minority Members as con-
ferees, the Chairman shall consult with the
Ranking Minority Member of the Com-
mittee.
C. HEARINGS
RULE 13. WITNESSES
In order to assure the most productive use
of the limited time available to question
hearing witnesses, a witness who is sched-
uled to appear before the full Committee or
a Subcommittee shall file with the Clerk of
the Committee at least 48 hours in advance
of his or her appearance a written statement
of their proposed testimony. In addition, all
witnesses shall comply with formatting re-
quirements as specified by the Committee
and the Rules of the House. Failure to com-
ply with the 48–hour rule may result in a
witness being denied the opportunity to tes-
tify in person. Failure to comply with the
formatting requirements may result in a
witness’ statement being rejected for inclu-
sion in the published hearing record. In addi-
tion to the requirements of clause 2(g)(5) of
Rule XI of the Rules of the House regarding
information required of public witnesses, a
witness shall limit his or her oral presen-
tation to a summary of their position and
shall provide sufficient copies of their writ-
ten statement to the Clerk for distribution
to Members, staff and news media.
A witness appearing at a public hearing, or
submitting a statement for the record of a
public hearing, or submitting written com-
ments in response to a published request for
comments by the Committee must include in
their statement or submission, a list of all
clients, persons or organizations on whose
behalf the witness appears. Oral testimony
and statements for the record, or written
comments in response to a request for com-
ments by the Committee, will be accepted
only from citizens of the United States or
corporations or associations organized under
the laws of one of the 50 States of the United
States or the District of Columbia, unless
otherwise directed by the Chairman of the
full Committee or Subcommittee involved.
Written statements from noncitizens may be
considered for acceptance in the record if
transmitted to the Committee in writing by
Members of Congress.
RULE 14. QUESTIONING OF WITNESSES
Committee Members may question wit-
nesses only when recognized by the Chair-
man for that purpose. All Members shall be
limited to five minutes on the initial round
of questioning. In questioning witnesses
under the five minute rule, the Chairman
and the Ranking Minority Member shall be
recognized first, after which Members who
are in attendance at the beginning of a hear-
ing will be recognized in the order of their
seniority on the Committee. Other Members
shall be recognized in the order of their ap-
pearance at the hearing. In recognizing
Members to question witnesses, the Chair-
man may take into consideration the ratio
of Majority Members to Minority Members
and the number of Majority and Minority
Members present and shall apportion the rec-
ognition for questioning in such a manner as
not to disadvantage Members of the Major-
ity.
RULE 15. SUBPOENA POWER
The power to authorize and issue sub-
poenas is delegated to the Chairman of the
full Committee, as provided for under clause

kept of all testimony taken at a public hear-
ing. The staff shall transmit to a witness the
transcript of his or her testimony for correc-
tion and immediate return to the Committee
offices. Only changes in the interest of clar-
ity, accuracy and corrections in transcribing
errors will be permitted. Changes that sub-
stantially alter the actual testimony will
not be permitted. Members shall have the op-
portunity to correct their own remarks be-
fore publication. The Chairman of the full
Committee may order the printing of a hear-
ing without the corrections of a witness or
Member if he determines that a reasonable
time has been afforded to make corrections
and that further delay would impede the con-
sideration of the legislation or other meas-
ure that is the subject of the hearing.
RULE 17. BROADCASTING OF HEARINGS
The provisions of clause 4(f) of Rule XI of
the Rules of the House of Representatives
are specifically made a part of these rules by
reference. In addition, the following policy
shall apply to media coverage of any meet-
ing of the full Committee or a Sub-
committee:
(1) An appropriate area of the Committee’s
hearing room will be designated for members
of the media and their equipment.

Committee room while the Committee is in
session. Individual interviews must take
place before the gavel falls for the convening
of a meeting or after the gavel falls for ad-
journment.
(3) Day-to-day notification of the next
day’s electronic coverage shall be provided
by the media to the Chairman of the full
Committee through an appropriate designee.

mittee Members or witnesses.

ceedings when a record vote is ordered on the

cising postponement authority the Chairman
shall take reasonable steps to notify Mem-
bers on the resumption of proceedings on any
postponed record vote.
When proceedings resume on a postponed
question, notwithstanding any intervening
order for the previous question, an under-
lying proposition shall remain subject to fur-
ther debate or amendment to the same ex-
tent as when the question was postponed.

AND OTHER COMMITTEE MEETINGS

kept accurately reflecting all markups and
other official meetings of the full Committee
and the Subcommittees, whether they be
open or closed to the public. This official
transcript, marked as ‘‘uncorrected,’’ shall
be available for inspection by the public (ex-
cept for meetings closed pursuant to clause
2(g)(1) of Rule XI of the Rules of the House),
by Members of the House, or by Members of
the Committee together with their staffs,
during normal business hours in the full
Committee or Subcommittee office under
such controls as the Chairman of the full
Committee deems necessary.
The Chairman may provide a Member of
the Committee with electronic access to an
unofficial transcript of an open markup or
other open official meeting of the full Com-
mittee or a Subcommittee upon written re-
quest by the Member to the Chairman, but
the Member shall not cause such electronic
unofficial transcript to be published or oth-
erwise made publically available.
If (1) in executing technical and con-
forming changes, the Office of the House
Legislative Counsel or (2) in the preparation
of a Committee report, the Chief of Staff of
the Joint Committee on Taxation deter-
mines (in consultation with appropriate ma-
jority and minority committee staff) that it
is necessary to review the official transcript
of a markup, such transcript may be released
upon the signature and to the custody of an
appropriate committee staff person. Such
transcript shall be returned immediately
after its review in the drafting session.
The official transcript of a markup or
Committee meeting other than a public
hearing shall not be published or distributed
to the public in any way except by a major-
ity vote of the Committee. Before any public
release of the uncorrected transcript, Mem-
bers must be given a reasonable opportunity
to correct their remarks. In instances in
which a stenographic transcript is kept of a
conference committee proceeding, all of the
requirements of this rule shall likewise be
observed.

Committee staff pursuant to primary and ad-
ditional expense resolutions, shall ensure

staff to carry out its responsibilities under

nority party is fairly treated in the appoint-
ment of such staff.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-

Let us pray.
Eternal Lord God, give our law-
makers this day the wisdom to seek
Your guidance and to make time to
consider and act on your precepts. May
they not simply embrace the opinions
of others but seek Your truth for their
lives.
Lord, make them muscular thinkers,
not merely reflectors of the thoughts
of others. Help them to make pleasing
you, O God, their first priority. May
they serve You with such humility and
gratitude that You can bless them in
ways that stagger their imaginations.
And, Lord, be with the members of
the illustrious Senate page class, who

STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S SE-
CURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
ACT OF 2019—MOTION TO PRO-
CEED—Resumed
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
move to proceed to S. 1.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the motion.
The legislative clerk read as follows:
Motion to proceed to S. 1, a bill to make
improvements to certain defense and secu-
rity assistance provisions and to authorize
the appropriation of funds to Israel, to reau-
thorize the United States-Jordan Defense Co-
operation Act of 2015, and to halt the whole-
sale slaughter of the Syrian people, and for
other purposes.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President,
later today—on day 34 of this partial
government shutdown—the Senate will
be voting on a proposal to finally end
it. We will be voting on the one plan—
the only one on the table—that would
reopen the shuttered portions of the
Federal Government. It is a pragmatic
compromise that could end this im-
passe right away.
The choice is absolutely clear, and
the Nation is watching. Members can
vote to immediately reopen the entire
government with a compromise pack-
age that the President will actually
sign, or they can hold out for the
Democratic leader’s dead-end proposal
that stands no chance of earning the
President’s signature and ending the
partial shutdown.
The President’s compromise would
accomplish three things. First, it ends
the shutdown and resumes pay for Fed-
eral workers right away. Second, it
strikes a bipartisan compromise on the
issue of immigration and border secu-
rity with ideas from both sides. Third,
it provides stable, full-year funding for
the Federal Government, not another
short-term bandaid.
First, ending the shutdown. We have
heard from Federal workers whose
lives are in disarray. We have heard
about the family hardships caused by
the Democrats’ unwillingness to sit
down and negotiate with the President.
We have heard from those who have en-
dured over a month without pay. We
have heard from the men and women of
the U.S. Coast Guard, air traffic con-
trollers, TSA agents, and other Federal
employees. Every American deserves a
fully operational government. Tax-
payers aren’t getting special tax re-
funds for these weeks when services
and Agencies have been diminished or
are unavailable.
The President has been at the negoti-
ating table, ready to talk and to fix it.
Democrats have made the opposite po-
litical calculation, and our Nation is
paying the price.
The way forward is simple. We all
know the ground rules. We need a com-
promise that can pass both Chambers
and earn the Presidential signature.
That is the way you make a law in this
country. The first proposal we will vote
on today is the only legislation that
exists with any chance of checking
those boxes—getting the President’s
signature and making a law.
On immigration and border security,
this legislation provides the resources
the men and women who risk their own
safety to defend our border tell us are
necessary. In the past year, we have
watched as apprehensions of family
units at the borders have risen—more
young people brought into danger.
They have seen more interdiction of
illicit substances like heroin, meth-
amphetamine, and fentanyl and higher
rates of attempted crossings by gang
members and criminals.
The need for more security on our
border is not a partisan invention. It is
a fact. It is a reality most Senate
Democrats readily admit.
One Senate Democrat said: ‘‘I’m will-
ing to support more border security.’’
Another said: ‘‘Certainly, you need
barriers. And we support barriers.’’
Not to be outdone, a third said: ‘‘I’m
a huge advocate of border security.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S542 January 24, 2019
If they agree with the need, they
should agree with this modest pro-
posal. It would fund new enforcement
and surveillance technologies, recruit-
ing and training hundreds of new Bor-
der Patrol agents, and it would direct
about one one-thousandth of Federal
discretionary spending for physical
barriers along the highest priority sec-
tions of the border—barriers like the
ones that the current Democratic lead-
er joined then-Senators Obama, Biden,
and Clinton in supporting back in 2006;
like the barriers constructed by Presi-
dent Obama’s own administration; like
the barriers in which many of my
Democratic colleagues happily voted to
invest billions of dollars during the
last Congress.
These commonsense physical barriers
were a bipartisan point of agreement
until about 5 minutes ago, but the
President went even further to win
Democrats’ support. For example, his
proposal also provides for a 3-year legal
status for certain individuals currently
covered by DACA and TPS.
That is what this law provides: the
border security we need, plus actual
statutory authorization for DACA re-
cipients, written into law, for the first
time—not the unilateral hand-waving
of the Obama administration.
Finally, this bill would complete the
full-year appropriations that both par-
ties worked very hard on last year. The
last thing we need is another tem-
porary measure. Last year’s appropria-
tions process left stable, bipartisan
funding measures on the 1-yard line.
We don’t need to punt from the 1-yard
line and set up another crisis just like
this a couple of weeks from now. We
need to finish our work and run these
seven full-year bipartisan funding bills
into the end zone—into the end zone—
and finish last year’s work.
Let me conclude by simply stating
what will be on display in this Cham-
ber today. The American people will
see plainly which Senators want to
make a law and clean up this mess and
which Senators are content to continue
making political points and nothing
else.
Making law versus making points,
that is a choice. Any one of my Demo-
cratic colleagues who rejects the com-
promise offer but votes for the Demo-
cratic leader’s partisan showmanship
will be saying the following: They will
be saying that political fights with the
President matter more—more—than
Federal workers and their families,
border security, DACA and TPS recipi-
ents, as well as government funding.
Let me say that again. If my Demo-
cratic colleagues reverse their voting
records on border security, if they de-
cide that spending one one-thousandth
of Federal spending on Obama-style
steel barriers has become totally im-
permissible just because President
Trump is in the White House, then,
they will be saying that political
games outrank Federal workers, the
Coast Guard, DACA recipients, TPS re-
cipients, and all their constituents, as
far as this Democratic Party is con-
cerned.
Deep down, my friends across the
aisle know this is not a reasonable re-
action to a President of the other
party. They know the Speaker of the
House is unreasonable on these sub-
jects, with her own Members and her
own House majority leader openly con-
tradicting her on national television,
and that Senate Democrats are not ob-
ligated to go down with her ship.
They know that denying the Presi-
dent one-tenth of 1 percent for spend-
ing on needed border security is not
worth hurting this many people. It is
obvious what the Senate needs to do.
Today, we will decide whether we
turn a new corner and begin putting
the last month behind us or whether we
will all continue to show up for work,
stuck in exactly the same situation.
Only one bill does all the bipartisan
things I discussed. Only one bill has
any chance whatsoever of becoming
law. So we ought to vote for it.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Presi-
dent Trump has kept the government
shut down for 34 days, and the pain in-
flicted on the American people and
their government is getting deeper and
deeper every day.
Our economy is suffering. First quar-
ter GDP is in the tank. Consumer con-
fidence has fallen.
Our national security is suffering.
FBI agents attest that criminal and
anti-terrorism investigations are se-
verely constrained. Border patrol, TSA,
and hundreds of thousands of homeland
security personnel are working under
limitations. These people are all part
of our security.
President Trump keeps saying that
we need the wall for security. Most
people disagree with that, but even if
we did agree, it is not going to be built
for years. Our security is suffering
today because of the Trump shutdown.
It is so bad that five former DHS Secre-
taries wrote a letter to President
Trump, urging him to end the shut-
down without the wall, including his
former Chief of Staff John Kelly, a
loyal soldier if ever there were one.
Kelly knows and they all know that
this shutting down of the government
for the President’s wall, which most
Americans believe we should not build,
is wrong. The President’s former Chief
of Staff is telling President Trump that
his position on the shutdown is wrong,
that his position on the shutdown is a
threat to national security—I would
argue far more than not building a
huge, ineffective wall.
Yesterday, a joint statement from
the air traffic controllers, pilots, and
flight attendants unions issued a dire
warning: ‘‘In our risk averse industry,
we cannot even calculate the risk cur-
rently at play, nor predict the point at
which the system will break.’’
Mr. Donald Trump, President, if you
cared about security, you would open
the government now. You are the only
one standing in the way. We know
most of our Republican colleagues
want the government opened. They are,
in a positive way, loyal to you and, in
a negative way, afraid to buck you, but
they all know it. Everyone knows it.
Of course, 800,000 Federal workers are
on the cusp of missing their second
paycheck—a month’s share of pay.
Some require the assistance of food
banks to get by. That is so disheart-
ening. Hard-working people who just
want to help their families have a de-
cent life have to go to a food bank.
They did nothing wrong. President
Trump is using them as hostages. Here
is how callous this administration is.
When asked about that fact this morn-
ing, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross,
a billionaire, said ‘‘I know they are,
and I don’t really quite understand
why.’’ He argues that it is easy for fur-
loughed workers to get a loan.
Those comments are appalling and
reveal the administration’s callous in-
difference toward the Federal workers
he is treating as pawns. Secretary
Ross’s comments are the 21st century
equivalent of ‘‘Let them eat cake.’’
Many of these Federal employees live
paycheck to paycheck. Secretary Ross,
they can’t just call their stockbroker
and ask them to sell some of their
shares. They need that paycheck.
We need to end this shutdown now.
There is only one way to do it. This
afternoon, for the first time since
President Trump shutdown the govern-
ment in December, the Senate will
have a chance to vote on a bill that re-
opens the government.
Leader MCCONNELL says that Presi-
dent Trump’s bill is the only way to re-
open the government. Bull. He claims
that our bill will not pass because
President Trump will not sign it. Has
he ever heard of a veto override? Has
he ever heard of article I?
The bill that President Trump has
put together can’t pass the House and
can’t pass the Senate, so it has no
chance of passing. For Leader MCCON-
NELL to say the only bill that has a
chance of opening up the government is
President Trump’s bill—where he puts
in a $5.7 billion wall, undoes many of
the asylum provisions, and is broadly
unpopular—is false. It is just wrong.
The two bills that are on the floor
are not equivalent votes. My friend on
the other side and some in the media
who are being lazy called the two votes
‘‘dueling proposals,’’ as if there is one
Republican proposal and one Demo-
cratic proposal and they are sort of
equal. It is just not true.
The President’s plan demands 100
percent of what the President wants—
$5.7 billion for a border wall plus rad-
ical new changes to our asylum system
before reopening the government. For
the Republican leader to call this a
compromise is laughable. There was no
Democratic signoff—not from me, not
from Senator DURBIN, not from any
other Democrat. It is a harshly par-
tisan proposal that essentially codifies

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S543
January 24, 2019
the President’s position that govern-
ment funding is a bargaining chip.
A vote for the President’s plan is an
endorsement of government by extor-
tion. If we let him do it today, he will
do it tomorrow and tomorrow and to-
morrow. The whole structure of our
government will change, and the chaos
that we now see will be magnified.
Even some of my Republican friends
have admitted that the President’s
plan is not a serious offer. A few days
ago, my friend from Oklahoma called it
‘‘a straw man proposal.’’ I think that
says it all. The President’s plan is a
straw man, not a serious offer. It is
merely a way to save face.
The second vote is the opposite. It
demands nothing before we reopen the
government—nothing. There are no
partisan demands, not things we want
or we will shut down the government.
We don’t do that. Only Trump does
that, and our Republican colleagues go
along. Our proposal allows us to open
the government and then, after the
government is opened, settle our dif-
ferences over border security. I know it
is not partisan because every single Re-
publican supported the same basic idea
just 1 month ago when we voted on it.
When President Trump changed his
mind and said no, everyone did a sort
of 180-degree reversal, including my
friend the Republican leader. He knows
it.
So the two votes are not the same.
They are not flip sides of the same
coin. The first vote is harshly partisan
and one-sided. The second vote is down
the middle and seeks to reopen govern-
ment and has received overwhelming
support from both sides before Presi-
dent Trump said he wouldn’t do it.
Calling the two votes equivalent is not
an attempt to simplify but to mislead.
Nonetheless, in a few hours, we will
take these two votes. The Senate will
have a chance to say no to the Presi-
dent’s hostage-taking, and then the
Senate will have a chance to send a
clear message that Congress is ready to
reopen the government.
To my Republican colleagues, even if
you are for the wall—all of those who
have said ‘‘I may be for the wall, but I
want to keep the government open’’
have a chance to do it on the second
vote. Let’s see how they vote.
Throughout this debacle, I have not
heard one good reason why 800,000 Fed-
eral employees must be held hostage
for us to discuss border security.
Democrats are happy to discuss border
security under regular order with the
government open. We support stronger
border security. President Trump be-
lieves the best way to do that is an ex-
pensive and ineffective wall. We dis-
agree sharply with that, but there is no
reason we can’t negotiate and figure it
out. What we can’t allow is the Presi-
dent to hijack our government and
hold it hostage every time we disagree
over policy, which he will do if he wins
this one.
The votes this afternoon are about
more than just a shutdown. They are
about how we govern in a democracy.
We are allowed to come here and dis-
agree over policy. In fact, our system
of government was designed to allow
for progress, despite our large and
sometimes raucous differences. But
when one side—in this case, the Presi-
dent—throws a temper tantrum and
uses the basic functioning of our gov-
ernment as leverage in a policy argu-
ment, our system of government
breaks down. If every President decided
to shut down the government when
they didn’t get a policy from Congress,
America would careen from crisis to
crisis, an endless spiral of gridlock and
dysfunction.
So the votes this afternoon are not
about border security. These votes are
about ending a manufactured crisis, a
self-inflicted wound that is bleeding
our country out a little more each day.
I hope and I pray that the Senate rises
to the occasion.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want
to thank my colleague and Democratic
leader Senator SCHUMER for making
clear what is going to happen on the
floor of the Senate this afternoon. We
have a chance, an opportunity when 100
Senators come to the floor, to put an
end to the government shutdown this
afternoon. I want to tell you, there is
nothing more important than that, as
far as I am concerned. I hope we will
rise to that occasion and rise to that
challenge.
During the last 2 days, what I have
done is travel across my home State of
Illinois and sit down and meet on an
informal basis with Federal employees
who are going through this government
shutdown. In the last couple of weeks I
have been to Peoria, Pekin, Aurora,
Marion, and I went to St. Louis,
though it is clearly not in Illinois, to
meet with air traffic controllers who
live in my State. I sat down and asked
them tell me the stories, to tell me
what has happened in the 34 days when
they haven’t been paid—34 days, as of
today. They were a little embarrassed
and a little reluctant to talk about
what it meant.
Eventually, I said ‘‘Well, tell me
about some of your coworkers,’’ which
is usually a way that people can tell
their own stories without embarrass-
ment. I heard some stories that are
breaking my heart as I stand here at
this moment.
Have you ever been in an air traffic
control tower? It is amazing. I have
seen some of the biggest. We had one
up in Elgin, IL, which takes care of
O’Hare and Midway and all of our great
airports. It is a little bit frightening to
go into one of these towers and see 10,
20, 30 air traffic controllers looking at
these screens. On those screens are lit-
tle dots, and each one of the dots is an
airplane, and in each one of the air-
planes there are going to be 20, 30, 40,
150, 200 people. That air traffic con-
troller has an awesome responsibility
to make sure that they are on the right
path for takeoff and landing, to make
sure that their paths don’t cross. A
mistake in that job can be fatal. That
is the reality of what they face.
Air traffic controllers have one of the
most stressful jobs in the Federal Gov-
ernment. We don’t think about it. We
get on the plane; we get off the plane.
Thank goodness for those men and
women who are there to make sure it is
a safe experience for all of us.
Do you know that the shifts that are
worked by air traffic controllers are 10-
hour shifts? How would you like to face
a 10-hour shift with that kind of stress
every single day you go to work? Do
you know how many days a week they
work? Six. Six out of seven days they
are working 10-hour shifts in one of the
most stressful jobs we have in America.
Do you wonder why they work 6 days?
Most people work 5 days, and they cer-
tainly don’t work 10-hour shifts. It is
because there is a shortage of air traf-
fic controllers. At age 56, you have to
leave. Literally, you have to leave as of
the next day. You cannot continue to
work because they decided that at age
57, you are too old to do this job. It is
too stressful.
As these air traffic controllers are
leaving, we are hoping, in a system
that works, they are being replaced by
new air traffic controllers who are
skilled and trained so they can take
over these important, life-and-death
jobs.
Do you know what happened because
the government shut down? We stopped
the input of new air traffic controllers,
so the number is continuing to dimin-
ish because of mandatory retirement,
and the pressure on those air traffic
controllers increases. It increases not
just because of fewer numbers; it in-
creases because of what we have done
to their lives.
These men and women are totally in-
nocent when it comes to our debate
about border security. They had abso-
lutely nothing to do with the Presi-
dent’s promise of a grand and glorious
wall from sea to shining sea, paid for
by the Mexicans. They didn’t make
that up; the President did. Now he has
called for a government shutdown until
his campaign promise is fulfilled.
I talked to some of those air traffic
controllers. What is it like? What are
you facing? They went through a long
litany of things they are facing. Many
of them are struggling because of no
paycheck coming in. It is difficult for
them. A couple of them were embar-
rassed to say that they are going to
food pantries set up by churches and
charities in their hometown to pick up
some groceries to feed their families
during this government shutdown. Oth-
ers talked to me about children in
their families with serious medical
problems. Yes, they continue to get
their health insurance as Federal em-
ployees, but there are copays they have
to pay out-of-pocket. They worry about
making those payments now that they
are not getting a regular paycheck, and
they can’t see any end in sight as to
when they will.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S544 January 24, 2019
A couple of them have some very
practical issues. One of them went to
one of his coworkers, who is the head
of the local union for those air traffic
controllers, and he said: I want to tell
you something in confidence. I have 5
days left here. I cannot continue to
come to work beyond 5 days. I drive a
long distance. I have to buy gasoline
for my car. I have to find another job.
I may have to drive an Uber car. That
is what some Federal employees are
doing. I may have to find some job
tending bar—which some Federal em-
ployees are doing—just so there is in-
come coming in for my family.
The worst one was in St. Louis,
where this woman air traffic controller
said: One of my colleagues here at air
traffic control confided in me that he
has to drive a long distance to get to
work in St. Louis. He buys a lot of gas-
oline each day to make that roundtrip.
To buy gasoline last week, he went and
sold plasma from his own body to get
the cash to buy the gas. That is the re-
ality of this government shutdown.
All of us asked these air traffic con-
trollers: Do you see any evidence on
the job that people aren’t doing the job
as they are supposed to?
No, we have an awesome, life-or-
death responsibility here, and we take
it seriously. But they quickly added:
Senator, if this continues and people
are not replaced, we are going to reach
a point where we have to keep the sys-
tem safe. To keep it safe, the distance
between aircraft flying into and out of
airports will have to be increased and
the intervals between aircraft will have
to be increased so there is always a
safe atmosphere when it comes to our
airports.
What happens when that interval and
distance are increased? Your flight is
late again. Mine was about an hour and
a half late leaving O’Hare last night.
We asked why. A member of the crew
was coming in on an international
flight. She had to go through Customs.
Customs has been reduced in number to
two people at St. Louis because of the
government shutdown, so it took her
an extra hour to join up with the flight
I was on. It was a minor inconvenience
for me but maybe a major inconven-
ience for some other passenger.
It is an indication of what happens
when all these men and women who are
behind the scenes keeping our air con-
trol system working are under pressure
and when there are fewer of them than
there should be doing their job. It re-
flects what happens when we don’t
have enough people in the Customs sec-
tion at international airports to proc-
ess people in a timely way. The system
slows down.
Why are we at this point? Did the air
traffic controllers need to be punished
for something? If they did, I don’t
know what it might be. They are good
men and women. They are trained in
such a fashion that very few people
could actually do their job. It is inter-
esting. I have been down to Oklahoma
City and places where they have been
trained. Everybody doesn’t cut it. You
have to be pretty darn sharp to be able
to keep track of all those aircraft and
to not buckle under pressure because it
is a pressure-filled job. President
Trump’s shutdown has added pressure
to that job. Does it make you feel safer
when you get on an airplane to know
that? I don’t. I worry about it. I worry
about those men and women who sim-
ply want to do what they were hired to
do.
Incidentally, about one-third of them
are veterans. They served our coun-
try—many of them in the Air Force—
and they took the skills they learned
in the military and brought them into
air traffic control.
We give a lot of speeches on the floor
here, Republicans and Democrats,
about how we want to honor our vet-
erans. How can we be honoring our vet-
erans when 800,000 Federal employees
have gone without pay for 34 days, and
between 25 and 35 percent of them, de-
pending on the Agency, are veterans?
Are we honoring our veterans by not
paying them in a timely fashion?
The first bill we have today is Presi-
dent Trump’s bill in dealing with this
crisis. It will deal with the shutdown
he created, but it also addresses several
other problems which the President
made a decision on and we are trying
to fix. I want to address one of them in
particular because it is an issue I have
worked on for a long time; that is, the
fate of people known as Dreamers,
those who are protected by DACA.
These are people who were brought to
the United States as children, some of
them as infants and babies. They grew
up in this country believing this was
home. They went to school here. They
prepared for a future life. At some
point, usually in their teenage years,
their parents brought them in and said:
We never filed the papers for you. You
are undocumented in America.
Through no fault of their own, they
were brought to this country, grew up
here, and they learned some time in
high school that there is no future for
them in America.
I have met so many of them over the
years, these Dreamers. I appealed to
President Obama: Do something to
help them. And he did. He created the
DACA Program. The DACA Program
allows these young people I just de-
scribed to apply for protection for 2
years at a time—protection from being
deported from America—and to be al-
lowed to work legally in America. Al-
most 800,000 came forward across the
Nation and signed up for this protec-
tion under President Obama. These are
amazing young people. They are tomor-
row’s doctors and engineers and law-
yers and teachers and leaders. They are
incredible young people. I have met so
many of them. All they are asking for
is a chance to be part of America’s fu-
ture.
President Trump came in September
of 2017 and announced he was abol-
ishing this program, abolishing the
DACA Program, which meant that
these young people had no protection
for the future and really didn’t know
which way to turn. President Trump
challenged us to come up with legisla-
tion to solve the problem he created.
We were unable to do so. We couldn’t
reach an agreement. The President’s
bill, his own solution to the problem,
came before the Senate and received 39
votes. It didn’t even receive the sup-
port of his own political party when he
brought it up. It just wasn’t a reason-
able approach.
The President said last weekend: I
am going to address the fate of DACA
and Dreamers as part of this effort to
end the stalemate in Washington.
My hopes were raised. He talked
about a bill that I had introduced with
Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM, Republican
of South Carolina, 2 years ago called
the BRIDGE Act and said that is what
we are going to do. It sounded hopeful.
Maybe this would be part of the solu-
tion. For these young people, it meant
everything that they might have a
chance to be able to stay in this coun-
try and not be deported.
It turns out that when the President
produced this bill a couple of days ago
and we read the text, it was a bitter
disappointment. It really bears no re-
semblance to the BRIDGE Act, which
he referred to.
I would say to my colleagues in the
Senate who are considering voting for
the President’s bill: Please don’t vote
for it if you think you will be doing
something to help DACA and the
Dreamers. This bill, as written by the
Department of Homeland Security Sec-
retary, Kirstjen Nielsen, and Mr. Mil-
ler, who is the President’s adviser at
the White House, shows their barely
masked contempt for these young peo-
ple. They have dramatically increased
the costs of going through this proc-
ess—doubled it. They have set in new
conditions so they can eliminate more
and more people from being eligible for
this protection. They added provisions
that are totally unnecessary. During
the 7 years DACA has been in place, we
have seen positive things happen, not
negative things. Unfortunately, what
the President proposes now is a dra-
matic step backward. This does not
help.
After meeting with air traffic con-
trollers and Federal prison guards at
Federal penitentiaries in Marion and
Pekin, I can tell you what they want.
They want the shutdown to end today.
They want to get a paycheck for their
families so they can get back to the
business of being good husbands, good
fathers, and good members of their
community. They are embarrassed
about going to these food pantries.
They can’t imagine what they are
going to do because of some problems
that have been created with their cred-
it ratings because this President has
shut down their paychecks for 34 days.
These prison guards and air traffic
controllers don’t have any choice but
to come to work. They are called essen-
tial personnel. I would hope at the end

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S545
January 24, 2019
of this day that we would think of
them first and make sure the shutdown
ends immediately, today.
One other thing. This needs to be the
last time we have this conversation on
the floor of the Senate—the last time.
We have to make government shut-
downs an unacceptable tactic of either
political party or any branch of our
government. It is absolutely terrible
that these innocent people who work
for our government are paying the
price of our inability to reach a polit-
ical agreement on issues. We can find
an agreement on border security, but it
shouldn’t be because 800,000 innocent
Federal employees haven’t received a
paycheck for 34 days.
Let’s step forward and do this in a bi-
partisan fashion. Over this last week-
end, I received scores of phone calls
from my colleagues in the Senate.
Some people may find it hard to be-
lieve, but Republicans have called, and
I have called them, and Democrats
have called. There is a bipartisan feel-
ing that this crisis—this manufactured
crisis—has to come to an end.
The second vote that will be offered
today—the one the Democrats will
offer—is simply to extend the con-
tinuing resolution to fund our govern-
ment, end the shutdown immediately,
and give us a matter of days to get this
job done in coming to a compromise on
border security. I know we can do it. I
am convinced we can do it. I know
there is a feeling of good will, but we
need enough Republicans to join with
the Democrats to make this a bipar-
tisan effort today.
I don’t believe the President’s bill is
going to pass. There are aspects to it
that I described that are unacceptable
to so many of us. But this bare-bones
approach—a 3-week extension; a num-
ber of days to actually bargain and
compromise while the government is
up and running and people are being
paid—is a reasonable end to this.
I don’t know how any of us can go
home if, at the end of the day, we have
done nothing and the shutdown con-
tinues. Let’s stick here and do our
job—the job we were elected to do to
solve problems, not to create them.
As Senator SCHUMER said earlier,
there are so many individuals who are
providing security and safety across
our Nation. Whether it is our FBI, our
prison guards, the Coast Guard, the air
traffic controllers—why in the world
would we endanger any Americans be-
cause of our inability to reach a polit-
ical agreement? The votes today will
give us a chance to emerge from this
with a positive approach to solving this
problem. I believe we can do it. The
sooner the better.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
HAWLEY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I come
to the floor today as the chairman of
the Homeland Security Appropriations
Subcommittee to express my strong
support for the End the Government
Shutdown and Secure Our Borders Act.
This legislation includes many impor-
tant priorities, and they are important
priorities that we need to address now.
In the past several days and weeks,
there has been a lot of talk about who
has more leverage, who is winning, and
what the political stakes are. You hear
a lot of different answers to those ques-
tions, depending on whom you ask,
quite frankly, but I will tell you one
thing: Those are not the questions on
the minds of our Federal workers.
Just this morning, at about 4 o’clock,
I had a conversation with several TSA
agents at Yeager Airport, where I fly
out of to come to Washington. In talk-
ing about the situation, what I got in
response from them was a lot of head-
shaking and a lot of questions. Their
questions had to do with this: How are
they going to pay their bills and when
is this going to end? I understand their
frustration. I am frustrated.
That is exactly why I have always
said that a shutdown is no way to gov-
ern. It is not in anyone’s best interest.
It is a disservice to our Federal works.
It is a show of our inability to do our
jobs in conjunction with those on the
other side of the aisle, and it is a signal
to the American people that we think
this confusing and ineffective way to
govern is OK, when it is not. It is not
OK.
We are here in this body to work to-
gether, to get over the rifts that we
may have, and to move forward to do
the people’s work. We have to fix this
situation, and we have to fix it now.
We have an opportunity today to do
that, and I plan to do that by voting
for the President’s proposed com-
promise. This proposal does two things
that we should all want. It reopens the
government, and it helps to secure our
southern borders. If we pass this
amendment—and I hope we do—we will
bring our furloughed workers back to
work, and they will get paid. We will
pay the dedicated men and women of
our Coast Guard, our Federal prison
guards, our TSA and Border Patrol per-
sonnel, and many others—many of
whom I have talked with—and we will
take a major step forward in securing
our Nation.
I believe the resources in this bill are
necessary because I believe we do face
a crisis on our southern border. Last
year, in the last 3 months of 2018, over
153,000 people were apprehended ille-
gally crossing the southern border. And
that number does not include the peo-
ple who crossed illegally, but were not
apprehended. The number of illegal
border crossings was up more than 80
percent in the last 3 months of 2018, as
compared to the last 3 months of 2017.
The composition of those being de-
tained for crossing the border is chang-
ing. In 2000, 98 percent of those de-
tained for illegally crossing the border
were Mexican nationals, and most were
single adults. They could be repatri-
ated to Mexico very quickly, within
hours. But, in 2018, more than 56 per-
cent of individuals detained were from
places other than Mexico. A large por-
tion were from Honduras, Guatemala,
and El Salvador.
Increasingly, individuals are showing
up at our borders from all over the
world. Forty percent were either unac-
companied minors or arrived as part of
a family unit. That number is way up.
That number is way up. That means
longer detention proceedings that have
placed a burden on our immigration
court system, and it means an in-
creased need for facilities to safely and
responsibly house these people for a
longer period of time.
I have visited the detention centers
in Texas. I believe the facts make it
very clear that there is a crisis. The
amendment that we will vote on today
offers a solution.
We also know that physical barriers
work. In the San Diego, Tucson, El
Centro, and El Paso regions, where
there are constructed physical barriers,
the illegal border crossings have gone
down by more than 90 percent. That is
undeniable. Right now, we have 654
miles of physical barrier in place.
I have heard folks say that we don’t
have any walls or that we don’t have
any barriers. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. If
we pass this amendment, we can build
234 miles in areas like the Rio Grande
Valley, where career Border Patrol per-
sonnel tell us it is most needed.
There has been a lot of talk that the
professionals should be in charge here
in terms of telling us how and what the
best methods of protecting our borders
are. Well, they are in charge. As sub-
committee chair, I have had several
meetings with them for them to tell
me what their border security plan is,
and the CBP has that.
This amendment would fund the bulk
of the top 10 requests. They have a 33-
point plan. This would get us through
the top 10.
The funding in this bill provides for a
border wall system—a system—which
is much more than just a physical bar-
rier. It provides lighting, sensors, cam-
eras, and access roads to help our Bor-
der Patrol agents gain and maintain
operational control of the border.
These are the things that the Border
Patrol has asked for. A wall is not the
only solution, but it is a critical part
of the solution.
The resources included in the amend-
ment for the southern border are im-
portant to the security of our Nation,
and they are especially important to
address our drug crisis. Fentanyl sei-
zures by the Border Patrol away from
ports of entry are up 122 percent over
last year.
Remember, fentanyl is a killer. Over
half of the deaths by overdose in our
State in some bit or in some part in-
volved fentanyl.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S546 January 24, 2019
Methamphetamine seizures by the
Border Patrol away from ports of entry
are up 75 percent in the last three
years. The border wall system will re-
duce the flow of these illegal drugs be-
tween our points of entry.
We know that much of the heroin,
fentanyl, and methamphetamine that
are hurting so many Americans cross
our border at the ports of entry. This
amendment addresses that issue as
well. It provides $805 million for tech-
nology, canines, and personnel to stop
the flow of illegal drugs into our coun-
try. That is what West Virginians are
interested in. This drug crisis is really
impacting us. This would be an unprec-
edented investment in these types of
detection capabilities—a complete
game changer.
The amendment would allow us to
hire more people, which is another
thing the CPB says that they need—750
new border agents and 375 new Customs
officers to complement these invest-
ments.
The combination of technology and
personnel, both at our ports of entry
and along the border, with the border
wall system, would enhance our secu-
rity. It will choke off a major source of
the heroin and fentanyl that has dev-
astated my State, and I am sure the
Presiding Officer’s State, as well, and
across our country.
Resources are also included in the
amendment to detain those who are ap-
prehended for illegally crossing our
border. I support the important work
of the men and women of ICE, and I
want them to be able to maintain cus-
tody of offenders, rather than being
forced to release those who have en-
tered our country illegally due to a
lack of space. In my view, that is not
only more safe and secure for us, but it
is actually more safe and secure for
anybody who is involved in the immi-
gration system.
They and many more of the brave
men and women of the Department of
Homeland Security continue to per-
form these difficult tasks without get-
ting paid during this shutdown.
Chairman SHELBY’s amendment is
not a short-term patch. We are kind of
past the time where we need a short-
term patch. We need to move forward.
It is not a continuing resolution that
runs our government on autopilot for a
little while and denies the Senate the
ability to make smart choices in exer-
cising the power of the purse.
Instead, it includes seven full appro-
priations bills that received significant
bipartisan support in the Appropria-
tions Committee, one of which is my
bill at the Homeland Security Sub-
committee, which was passed in a bi-
partisan way. Four of these bills passed
the Senate floor with overwhelming
support. I am very proud that the bill
that I put forward in committee, along
with some additions, are a part of this
package.
There is $11.9 billion provided for our
Coast Guard—this was in my bill—in-
cluding to begin construction of some-
thing that I think is critical to our na-
tional security, which is the polar se-
curity cutters. More than $4.8 billion is
provided for the TSA to improve trans-
portation security, and $19.8 billion is
appropriated for FEMA to make sure
we have the necessary resources to re-
spond to past and future natural disas-
ters.
There are important priorities within
these bills from other subcommittees
as well. A couple I would like to high-
light are these. The Agriculture title
has $550 million for a rural broadband
pilot project that I strongly support as
part my Capito Connect plan in the
State of West Virginia. The FSGG title
has resources for the Drug-Free Com-
munities and High Intensity Drug Traf-
ficking Areas Program, which is crit-
ical for stopping the drug epidemic
that I have spoken about. The CJS
title has $468 million to combat the
opioid epidemic and another $30 mil-
lion for economic development assist-
ance to coalfield communities. These
are just a few examples of what the
Shelby amendment has.
The amendment that the Democratic
leader has proposed reopens the gov-
ernment through February 8. It pro-
vides no new resources to address the
security and humanitarian crisis on
our southern border. Let me repeat
that. It provides no new resources to
address the security and humanitarian
crisis on our southern border. Passing
the Schumer plan would put us in the
same position on February 8 that ex-
ists today.
We don’t need to pause the shutdown
for 15 days and ignore border security.
Article I of the Constitution gives us,
as the Congress, the power of the purse,
and we should exercise it by making
smart choices based on the situation
that is in front of us today.
Continuing resolutions only cut and
paste the choices that we made last
year. Instead, we should pass the seven
appropriations bills before us to fund
the government for the rest of the year
in a thoughtful way, in a bipartisan
way, while also providing the necessary
resources to protect our Nation.
President Trump has made a signifi-
cant concession by asking that we in-
clude a provision giving 3 years of cer-
tainty to those covered by the DACA
Executive order, as well as those who
have been on temporary protected sta-
tus. That provision is included in this
amendment. This is the type of reason-
able compromise that is necessary to
pass major legislation during a period
of divided government. No one—not the
President, not any Senator, not any
Representative—gets everything they
want in this bill or any bill, really.
The bill includes items that many of
us individually might have left out if
we wrote the bill ourselves, but that is
the nature of compromise.
The seven appropriations bills that
make up the Shelby amendment are
the product of significant bipartisan
compromise on behalf of the Nation. I
believe we should embrace the spirit of
compromise to end this shutdown and
secure our border. What can’t be com-
promised is our Nation’s security.
We just celebrated Martin Luther
King, Jr., Day last Monday. As was I
reading a lot of his famous quotes, I
thought about this one because of the
situation that we find ourselves in
right now:
If you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run
then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but
whatever you do, you have to keep moving
forward.
Let’s start moving forward together.
I hope that all of my colleagues will
embrace this sentiment, and I hope
that as I vote for the Shelby amend-
ment, we will get enough to push it
over the Senate floor and over to the
House.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this
afternoon Senate Democrats will have
the opportunity to vote to reopen the
government when the Senate takes up
the President’s compromise proposal. I
hope they are as serious about ending
the shutdown as they have claimed to
be.
Unfortunately, they haven’t looked
too serious over the past month. Demo-
cratic leaders have spent a lot of time
talking about ending the partial shut-
down, but they have absolutely refused
to engage in any genuine negotiations
to reopen the government. Democrats
don’t seem to understand that when
there is a disagreement, both sides
have to give a little in order to get
things resolved. If we are going to get
the government reopened, then both
Democrats and the President are going
to have to compromise.
The President understands this. He
has repeatedly made it clear that he is
willing to negotiate. On Saturday, he
put forward a genuine compromise—
legislation that addresses his border se-
curity priorities and some of Demo-
crats’ most important immigration pri-
orities.
Unfortunately, Democrats’ reaction
was less than promising. The Speaker
of the House labeled the compromise a
‘‘nonstarter’’ before she had even seen
it. But, of course, she offered no re-
placement.
President Trump offered a proposal
that he believed would address some of
the Democrats’ concerns. If Democrats
didn’t like that proposal, then they
could have offered an alternative—one
that addressed their concerns and at-
tempted to address some of the Presi-
dent’s concerns. But so far, the only
Democratic proposals have involved
the President agreeing to all of the
Democrats’ demands in exchange for
vague promises to address the security
and humanitarian crisis at the border
at some unspecified date in the future.
The Democratic leaders of the House
and Senate may be persisting in their
refusal to negotiate, but there are
signs that rank-and-file Democrats are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S547
January 24, 2019
starting to get restless. More than one
Democratic Member of Congress has
noted, in the words of one House fresh-
man, ‘‘[A]m I willing to talk about
more fencing and more drones and
more technology and radar and border
agents? Absolutely.’’
Even the House majority leader
sounded as though he was ready to
break with Speaker PELOSI’s obstruc-
tion, stating that Democrats are ‘‘for
border security’’ and that ‘‘physical
barriers are part of the solution.’’ That
is from the House majority leader.
I hope that spirit of compromise con-
tinues to grow. In a couple of hours,
Senate Democrats will have the chance
to vote on the President’s proposal.
The bill before us would immediately—
immediately—reopen the government.
It would provide paychecks and back-
pay to Federal workers. It would pro-
vide needed disaster recovery funding.
It would deliver all seven of the re-
maining 2019 appropriations bills, the
product of bipartisan work in the
House and in the Senate. It would
tackle the security and humanitarian
crisis at our border and address Demo-
cratic immigration priorities.
In fact, this bill contains a version of
immigration legislation originally
sponsored by the Democratic leader,
the Democratic whip, and the ranking
member on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, among others.
The bill before us today is a genuine
compromise. I hope at least some of my
Democratic colleagues will see their
way to supporting it because it is the
only legislation we will be voting on
today that can be signed into law, end
the shutdown, reopen the government,
make sure that Federal workers are
getting paid, and address our crisis at
the border.
Democrats’ refusal to engage in seri-
ous negotiations has already cost Fed-
eral workers a paycheck and limited
government services for literally tens
of thousands of Americans. It is time
for Democrats to stop putting their an-
tipathy for the President above the
needs of the American people. I hope
we do that this afternoon. The time
has come to make a deal, and we need
Democrats at the table.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, for Demo-
crats, antipathy to the President is not
the issue. The issue is antipathy to
shutting down the government.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to speak for up to 10 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. KAINE. The issue isn’t antipathy
to the President. It is that Democrats
don’t believe in shutting down govern-
ment.
I appreciate my colleague from
South Dakota stating the issue the
way he did at the beginning of his talk:
Democrats will not engage in negotia-
tions to reopen the government.
Let’s be plain. Democrats think the
Government of the United States
should never close. Democrats think
that using a shutdown as leverage to
get something else is illegitimate and
beneath the oath of office. The Presi-
dent, on the other hand, said that he is
proud to shut government down and is
willing to use the suffering of more
than 800,000 employees and millions of
American citizens to get his way.
The difference here is not on the im-
migration topics; there are differences
that can be resolved. But the difference
that is hard to resolve is a President
and a party that believe in government
shutdowns and a party that rejects the
idea of government shutdowns.
I will state complete willingness to
negotiate with this President and my
colleagues over border security. We—8
Democrats, 8 Republicans—introduced
a proposal in February with border se-
curity investments, protections for
Dreamers; 46 out of 49 of Democrats
supported a $25 billion border security
investment, and only 8 of 51 Repub-
licans did. The President blew up the
deal.
So the issue is not about negotiation
over border security. We have been a
more reliable party in making border
security investments than the major-
ity party has been. The issue is this: Is
it or is it not illegitimate to shut down
the government of the greatest Nation
on Earth and inflict needless pain on
hundreds of thousands of workers and
millions of citizens when you don’t get
your way? That is what is at stake.
Is the proposal that is on the table
offered by the President a ‘‘com-
promise’’? If it were a compromise, the
President would have talked to us
about it. If it were a compromise, the
majority would let us offer amend-
ments about it. If it were a com-
promise, the majority would have had
a hearing about it so that we could
have asked questions about it.
Introducing a 1,200-page bill on Tues-
day and calling a vote on Thursday and
giving Democrats no opportunity to
ask questions or propose amendments
is not a compromise. It is my way or
the highway. What we should be doing
to show that we respect the President’s
proposal is referring it to the com-
mittee of origin, having committee
hearings and markup next week, and
putting it on the floor the following
week. If the President means it as a
compromise, he should allow the
Democratic Party—minority here and
majority in the House—to have an op-
portunity to shape it.
It is my hope that my Republican
colleagues will vote to reopen govern-
ment this afternoon, through February
8, so that we would use next week to
have a committee process to consider
the President’s proposal and the fol-
lowing week consider it on the floor.
These are important enough topics
that it would seem giving it a 2-week
review by committee and by Senators
on the floor is not asking too much.
Briefly, before yielding to my col-
league from Missouri, I will say that I
just returned from Reagan National
Airport, where I met with air traffic
controllers, TSA agents, airline safety
specialists who maintain the radar and
other safety equipment at this and
other airports. They talked about how
this shutdown in which they are work-
ing but not being paid is starting to
fray them as they are working over-
time, as they are trying to get jobs
when they are not working 10-hour
shifts to try to cover the bills they
have to cover for babysitters and rent
and medical appointments. They are
talking about the degradation of the
safety of American air traffic because
of air traffic controllers not being paid,
TSA agents not being paid, airline safe-
ty specialists not being paid and, in
some instances, furloughed. If nothing
else, we should care about the safety of
commercial aviation. That is one rea-
son, among many, that we should end
the shutdown.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, you may
have presided before, but you haven’t
presided when I have spoken on the
floor, so it is great to welcome you, as
both my colleague and the Presiding
Officer, and I am glad to be working
with you and glad we are both here
today.
We are both here today at a time
when the American people really ex-
pect the government to work; the
American people really expect people
in Congress to be able to find middle
ground. For too long we have been
stuck—frankly, on both sides of the
aisle—with too many people who ran
for office saying: If I don’t get what I
want—I just don’t want anything to
happen unless it is exactly what I
want. The best I can tell, that doesn’t
work anywhere. If you are getting what
you want wherever you are working,
wherever you are living, wherever you
are going to church, there is probably
something wrong with you. Democracy
is about compromise.
I think one of the great fallacies of
the second option we will have today is
that it is designed to keep the govern-
ment open for 2 weeks at last year’s
spending levels, and then, at the end of
2 weeks—I don’t know what happens
then. There will be no information that
Members of the Senate and the House
will know 2 weeks from now that they
don’t know now. There is nothing that
could be debated or discussed in the
next 2 weeks that couldn’t be discussed
in the next 45 minutes.
I think it is pretty clear to the Amer-
ican people that this has boiled down
to a fight in which we need to reopen
the government and, frankly, we need
to secure the border.
I just heard our good friend, our col-
league from Virginia, say that, gen-
erally, his side of the aisle has been
better than our side of the aisle at se-
curing the border. I don’t think that is
necessarily true, but I am glad to con-
cede that if our friends on the other

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S548 January 24, 2019
side want to step up and work with us
to secure the border—fine.
I will also point out that securing the
border for the last four Presidents has
meant building barriers, and every
time that happened, those barriers
worked.
When President George H.W. Bush
built a barrier south of San Diego, the
detentions of people coming across the
border decreased by 95 percent. That is
really the only way we have of meas-
uring whether this was better before
the barrier or after the barrier. When
you have 95 percent fewer people com-
ing across and being detained, some-
thing must be working.
President Clinton built a barrier at
El Paso, and detentions went down 95
percent. President George W. Bush
built a barrier at Yuma, and detentions
went down 90 percent. When you have a
90- or 95-percent solution, you should
be able to make that solution a part of
moving forward to solve the problem.
The President has come, in my view,
quite a way. He has gone from a big
wall all along the border to a barrier
only where a barrier makes sense. The
President would like to add 10 or 20
percent to the barriers already built by
all four of his predecessors. I don’t see
why some movement in that direction
can’t be part of what we get done.
The shutdown has gone on too long.
It has been played out way too much in
the public and way too little with
Members of Congress trying to get to-
gether and work this out. People who
need government services aren’t get-
ting those services. In many cases, peo-
ple providing the services that are es-
sential are providing those services and
not getting paid. People who would
like to be at work are at home.
Unlike any other time when the gov-
ernment has been shut down, Congress
has said in advance that everybody will
get paid, eventually. So the traditional
worry about whether you will get paid,
whether your income is there, is gone.
But the pay is not there at the time it
is expected to be. Normally, if you
went to work for government at any
level, you didn’t go to work for govern-
ment to get wealthy; you went to work
for government because that was a se-
cure job. So we have eliminated for too
many people the security of one of the
reasons they took a government job
rather than a job that might lead to
some more financially satisfactory des-
tination—or might not. The whole rea-
son they did this, in many cases, is
they knew that check was going to
come. It is not coming.
The bill the President proposed keeps
the government open with new prior-
ities—largely agreed to already by the
House and the Senate—until Sep-
tember 30. So 2 weeks from now, we
wouldn’t face this exact same problem
again. It does things I think need to be
done to create more security for kids
who were brought here as children and
grew up here. I think this is a 70- or 80-
percent issue in the country that all of
us understand—that if you were
brought to this country as a young
child, if you grew up here, if you
haven’t gotten in serious trouble, not
only should you be able to stay, but we
should want you to stay.
We need that kind of vitality in our
country. The President said he would
like to see a final appropriate solution
on that. This bill creates a 3-year op-
portunity, much like—I think it was
the BRIDGE Act that was sponsored by
people on both sides of the aisle who
would have said let’s settle this for a
while as we try to come to a further
conclusion; the same kind of 3-year
structure for people who were here be-
cause we decided we needed to give
them asylum. We need to figure out
how to deal with that on a long-term
basis, but 3 years not only puts it
through this Congress, it puts it a year
into the next Congress and the next
Presidential administration.
Some of us need to be focused on get-
ting this job done. I think this bill does
that. It is not perfect. I never voted for
a perfect bill. I introduced two or three
perfect bills, but I have never gotten to
vote for a perfect bill and don’t expect
to. This is not our job. Perfect is not
our job. Our job is the possible. I think
the President has actually shown more
flexibility than our friends on the
other side.
If you don’t like some of the things
the President has proposed, the re-
sponse is not this is a nonstarter. The
response is to make it a starter. The
response is, if you don’t like something
about what we are doing for deferred
action on kids who were brought here,
what would you do to make that bet-
ter?
The President’s proposal goes a long
way toward solving these problems.
Most importantly, it opens the govern-
ment immediately. It assures that will
be the case until we get to the begin-
ning of the new spending year on Octo-
ber 1, and it meets the government’s
obligation to secure the border.
Nobody expects it to be impossible
for anybody to ever get over the border
in any way, but people do expect to
have the kind of border security we can
afford. I think the proposals the Presi-
dent makes does that.
We need to be more concerned about
our ports of entry. We need to be more
concerned about things and people
coming across the border who
shouldn’t come across the border or
people being brought across the border
for purposes they do not want to be
part of.
This is an important moment. We
need to get this job done. The two
votes today will indicate whether we
want to get this done on a long-term
basis and get back into the regular
basis of government or whether we
want to get this done for a couple of
weeks, assuming somehow there are
going to be dramatically new facts on
the table in the next 2 weeks that are
not there now. I don’t believe that is
the case. I am going to vote for the bill
that gets the government open again
and lets us get started with the work of
how to fund the government on Octo-
ber 1 of this year, not how to fund the
government right now. I think the
other bill does not get us anywhere but
right back to where we are 2 weeks
from now.

Motion to proceed to S. 1, a bill to make

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.J. RES. 1
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as
my colleagues know, we have about
41,000 Active-Duty servicemembers in
the U.S. Coast Guard. They are running
vital missions right now in the South
China Sea. They are protecting our air-
space and ports along about 12,000
miles of coastline. They are performing
search and rescue missions that in-
clude nearly 1,200 Active-Duty Coast
Guard personnel in my home State of
Louisiana, the Eighth Coast Guard Dis-
trict. For that reason, I think the
members of our Coast Guard need to be
paid during this shutdown until we re-
solve our differences. We need to re-
solve our differences.
There are some good Members of
Congress, but right now, the American
people are wondering what they are
good for. It seems to me that we ought
to be able to reach an agreement that
secures the border—which I happen to
believe can’t be done without a bar-
rier—and that also opens the govern-
ment.
For that reason, Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the Coast
Guard be paid; that the Senate proceed
to the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 6, H.J. Res. 1; that the
Wicker amendment at the desk be
agreed to; that the bill as amended be
considered read a third time and
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, President
Trump is responsible not only for thou-
sands of Coast Guard personnel not
getting paid but also for hundreds of
thousands of other Federal employees
not getting paid.
Last week, I met with Coast Guard
Commandant Schultz, and I told him
to press Secretary Nielsen, who could
press the President to stop holding in-
nocent Federal employees hostage in
wall negotiations.
Last month, as we all know, the Sen-
ate voted unanimously to keep the gov-
ernment open into February so all Fed-
eral employees would get paid and the
President and Congress could sepa-
rately negotiate border security.
Today, the Senate will again have a
chance to vote on the same measure
that we passed unanimously in Decem-
ber. I expect that those who care about
getting our Coast Guard paid will sup-
port passing H.J. Res. 31, a continuing
resolution for the Department of
Homeland Security, and H.R. 648,
which are the conference bills for
FSGG, Interior, Environment, Agri-
culture, T-HUD, SFOPS, and CJS.
Will the Senator from Louisiana
modify his request to include the unan-
imous consent that the Senate proceed
to the immediate consideration of H.J.
Res. 648 and H.J. Res. 31 en bloc; that
the measure be considered read a third
time and passed en bloc; and that the
motion to reconsider be made and laid
upon the table with no action or de-
bate? That will pay all Federal employ-
ees who deserve to be paid.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
Senator so modify his request?
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I am smil-
ing because of the great admiration
and respect I have for the senior Sen-
ator from New York. I love to hear him
talk.
Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator would
yield, it is mutual.
Mr. KENNEDY. I love to hear him
talk. He can talk the ears off a jack-
rabbit.
Mr. SCHUMER. If the gentleman will
yield, we don’t do that in Brooklyn.
Mr. KENNEDY. He has waxed elo-
quently many times in this Chamber.
I remember back in 2005, 2006—I was
a mere lad—that we had a bill before
this Chamber that was called the Se-
cure Fence Act of 2006. Senator SCHU-
MER and then-Senator Obama—a rising
star—and Senator Hillary Clinton
talked passionately and eloquently
about how it was impossible to secure
a 1,900-mile piece of real estate without
having barriers. They talked elo-
quently. I remember agreeing with
them wholeheartedly that legal immi-
gration makes our country stronger,

that illegal immigration undermines
legal immigration, and that one way to
stop illegal immigration—not the only
way but one way—was with a border
barrier. That was then. This is now.
Now, my esteemed colleague knows
full well that his resolution will not ac-
complish either border security or the
opening up of this government because
President Donald Trump is going to
veto it. It will be a futile, useless exer-
cise. We can go through it if the Sen-
ator wants to. He can spend all day try-
ing to teach a goat how to climb a tree,
but he is better off hiring a squirrel in
the first place. There is a measure be-
fore this Senate, and the President has
put a proposal on the table that will
satisfy many of the concerns of our
Democratic friends and will ensure bor-
der security.
For that reason, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Is there an objection to the original
request?
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
object to the original request because
the Senator from Louisiana has not al-
lowed the rest of the Federal Govern-
ment to get paid. I would remind him,
whether it is squirrel, jackrabbit, or
armadillo, that we are the article I
branch of government, and because
President Trump says no, we have veto
override power, and we could get the
workers paid even if he will not sign it.
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Mississippi.
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I
was going to ask the distinguished
Democratic leader to have yielded
under his reservation.
Might I be recognized for just a mo-
ment? The objection has already been
heard, and we will not get this done.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
Senator from Louisiana yield the floor?
Mr. KENNEDY. Of course.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi is recognized.
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ap-
preciate the Senator from Louisiana.
His unanimous consent request would
have done one simple thing—gotten the
uniformed servicemembers in the Coast
Guard paid just like we are paying
today for members of the Army, Navy,
Air Force, and Marines. The Coast
Guard members are the only service-
men out there now who, under the Uni-
form Code of Military Justice, are re-
quired to perform their duties under
pain of penalty, and they are not being
paid as the others are. It would also
protect survivors’ benefits for the re-
tirees and their survivors in the Coast
Guard, as is being done with the other
uniformed services.
We may be getting close to a solution
on this. I certainly hope so. In the
meantime, I think it would be a signifi-
cant gesture on the part of the Demo-
crats and the Republicans in this Sen-
ate and in the House of Representa-
tives to pass this one small change
that the President has said he will sign
and to do the right thing by paying
members of this uniformed service. I
regret that the Senator has objected,
and I appreciate at least having a
chance to explain why this mere carve-
out is different from a larger solution
that may be coming soon.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
once again, I would simply remind my
dear friend from Mississippi that we
could do a whole lot more good by
funding and opening up the govern-
ment for everyone. President Trump
has claimed 25 times he wants to shut
down the government for his wall, and
he has gotten this Chamber to reverse
itself when it had originally passed
funding for the whole government. We
could do a lot more good if my amend-
ment to the proposal by my friend from
Louisiana were adopted. That is how it
is.
Now, on a different issue, I ask for
the yeas and nays on the motion to
proceed to S. 1.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a
sufficient second?
There is a sufficient second.
The yeas and nays are ordered.
The Senator from Alaska.
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President,
let me explain a little bit about what
we witnessed on the Senate floor. Actu-
ally, it may be a little bit confusing,
but it is an important issue.
With regard to the Coast Guard, my
colleagues from Louisiana and Mis-
sissippi have been working on this
issue for a while. It is not going to
solve the whole partial government
shutdown, but we have been working
with a number of our colleagues on the
other side of the aisle. Right now, this
bill for which my friend from Louisiana
asked to have unanimous consent has
23 cosponsors, and there might be
more. Actually, almost one-quarter of
the whole Senate—more Democratic
cosponsors than Republican cospon-
sors—is cosponsoring this bill to pay
the Coast Guard.
Again, we are working on the broader
issue of getting our government back
to the work of paying Federal workers,
but as my colleagues mentioned, the
Coast Guard is in a rather unique situ-
ation because it is the only military
service right now that is not getting
paid. Those in the Army, Navy, Air
Force, and Marines are all getting paid.
Right now, as we speak, the Coast
Guard’s men and women are out in my
great State of Alaska and are risking
their lives for Americans, as they al-
ways do. They are also out in other
places like the Middle East and in the
Persian Gulf. They are literally run-
ning patrols in the gulf, side by side,
with marines and sailors. The marines
and sailors are getting paid. The mem-
bers of the Coast Guard are not getting
paid.
By the way, if the members of the
Coast Guard say: ‘‘Do you know what?
I don’t want to deploy to the Middle
East right now. I am not getting paid’’
or ‘‘I don’t want to get on that ship to
save an Alaskan crabber whose life is
at risk,’’ they get court-martialed. So
the Coast Guard is in a very unique sit-
uation right now.
Here is the process we just witnessed.
A number of us—again, it was very bi-
partisan—went to the President and
said: Mr. President, we know it takes
the Senate and the House and the
White House to pass a bill. People are
working on the broader issue. We are
all working on the broader issue and on
the compromises we need. Hopefully,
we can get there this afternoon. In the
meantime, let’s try to get something
to pass as we have almost one-quarter
of the Senate in agreement—more
Democrats than Republicans—on this
bill that Senator KENNEDY just men-
tioned. Would you support this?
A number of us have had ongoing
conversations with the President of the
United States. I have raised this a
number of times with him and his ad-
ministration over the last 2 weeks. In a
meeting I had with him on Wednesday,
he said: I am 100 percent behind that
bill.
This is really important because, as
to some of what the minority leader
has said we should be bringing up, the
White House has said: We are not going
to support. OK. It is difficult to pass a
bill when you are not going to get the
President to sign it. Yet the President
will sign this bill, and almost 25 per-
cent of the Senate has said it is already
a cosponsor of it.
So what just happened for everybody
watching, particularly the Coast Guard
members?
When I learned that the President
was supportive last Thursday, we
brought this bill to the Senate floor,
and we hotlined it, which means we
were trying to move it through the
Senate very quickly. Every Republican
cleared that hotline. Essentially, it
means we all voted yes. When we took
it to our colleagues on the other side—
look, I know my colleagues, Democrats
and Republicans, care a lot about the
Coast Guard—it was stalled.
We kept asking: Come on. Don’t you
want to support this? You have a bunch
of cosponsors. Right now, the men and
women of the Coast Guard are very
unique in terms of the military’s not
getting paid, but there was just a
delay.
Senator KENNEDY said: I am going to
ask for a live unanimous consent. Let’s
just bring it up and pass it. The White
House would sign it. We could fix this
issue today. I bet most of the House
would certainly vote for it.
So he brought it up for unanimous
consent, and the minority leader ob-
jected.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle like to talk a lot about hos-
tage-taking with regard to Federal em-
ployees. I think they need to think a
bit harder about what just happened
with the men and women of the Coast
Guard. You heard it from the minority

leader. He said he is not going to do
anything about the Coast Guard right
now even though the President said he
would sign it. We could fix this to-
night.
Here is the point. We are all working
on the broader issue, and we are going
to vote on some things. If they fail this
afternoon, there are numbers of us who
are working on compromises to fix this
whole problem. In the meantime, why
shouldn’t we all be working on the im-
portant issue—it might not be with re-
gard to the whole government—of tak-
ing care of the men and women of the
Coast Guard? People are literally risk-
ing their lives right now for Ameri-
cans, not just in Alaska or in Texas but
all over the world, and they are the
only members of the military who are
not getting paid. We could fix it to-
night—the President will sign it—as we
are working on the broader issue.
I don’t understand why that is not an
acceptable path forward. In talking to
the men and women of the Coast
Guard—certainly, in my State—they
don’t understand either. Yes, we have
to come to a compromise on this broad-
er issue that ends the partial govern-
ment shutdown—that gets all of our
Federal workers back and that secures
our border. We are all working on that.
In the meantime, had the minority
leader of the U.S. Senate not objected,
everybody here—I guarantee you it
would have included my Democratic
colleagues—would have voted for this
bill to pay the Coast Guard. It just
doesn’t make sense.
I certainly hope my colleagues and
my good friend from New York will re-
consider their blocking of this bill, be-
cause we could fix at least one element
of this. We need to fix it all, but in my
view this is a very unique element. The
men and women who raised their hands
to support and defend the Constitution
and possibly die for this country are
not getting paid. Yet those in the
Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines
are. Let’s fix it tonight. We can fix it
tonight. Unfortunately, we just had an
objection to doing that. I think it is a
mistake, and I am hopeful my col-
leagues will reconsider.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise
to strongly support the Senator from
Alaska and the Senator from Louisiana
and the Senator from Mississippi.
We should pay our Coast Guard. It is
not right that we aren’t paying the
Coast Guard. Right now, every other
military branch is being paid. The
Army is being paid. The Navy is being
paid. The Air Force is being paid. The
Marines are being paid. Those in the
Coast Guard are not being paid even as
they are risking their lives.
Many of us in Texas and along the
gulf coast saw the incredible heroism
of the Coast Guard in the wake of Hur-
ricane Harvey, during which so many
brave men and women risked their
lives to save thousands upon thousands
of innocents. They should be paid. I
think it is important for the American
people to understand what just hap-
pened here because it is highly con-
sequential. It is easy for things to get
lost in procedural gobbledygook and to
assume: Well, this is some back and
forth about the shutdown and about
the wall. It has nothing to do with any
of that.
What Senator KENNEDY did was to
bring forward a bill to pay the Coast
Guard. The bill did nothing else. It
didn’t address any aspect of the shut-
down. It didn’t address any aspect of
the wall. It simply said: Let’s pay the
men and women in the Coast Guard—
yes or no. That means you can be a yes
on that, whether you think we need to
secure the border and have a steel bar-
rier or whether you support open bor-
ders. It doesn’t say anything either
way. It just says that the men and
women in the Coast Guard deserve pay-
checks.
We could have passed that right here
today. There is one reason and one rea-
son only that we didn’t. It is because
the Democratic leader stood up and
said: I object.
I note that if there are Democrats on
the Democratic side of the aisle who
are not comfortable with that, who
agree that the Coast Guard should be
paid, let me encourage my Democratic
colleagues to say so because it is their
party’s leader who has lodged an objec-
tion on behalf of, effectively, every
Democratic Senator.
The Democrats are fond of using the
phrase ‘‘hostage-taking.’’ They are,
quite literally, holding the men and
women of the Coast Guard hostage be-
cause they want to win a political vic-
tory against the President. Their ob-
jective here is to have the President
back down and to have not a single
mile of border wall built—never mind
that the Democratic leader and every
Democrat in this Chamber voted in 2013
to build and fund 350 miles of border
wall. That was 350 miles that every
Democrat in this Chamber voted for.
We are in a shutdown today because
they are now unwilling to fund 234
miles of border wall, which is less than
they voted for in 2013.
We understand that politics rears its
head in this business, and the Demo-
crats want to defeat the President po-
litically, and so the substance is sec-
ondary to trying to get the partisan
victory over the President. Let me sug-
gest that this ought to be an issue. We
keep fighting back and forth on wheth-
er securing the border or having open
borders is a good idea, but this ought
to be an issue that should be real sim-
ple.
Senator KENNEDY brought forward a
clean bill that does one thing and one
thing only. It pays the salaries of the
men and women in the Coast Guard. If
the Democratic leader hadn’t objected,
that would have passed right now. The
President could have signed it tonight.
The paychecks could have gone out
right now for every man and woman in
the Coast Guard.
If you are serving in the Coast Guard
in any of our 50 States, let me say: No.
1, thank you for your service. Thank
you for your heroism. Thank you for
the amazing difference you make. You
deserve to be paid. You will be paid.
But if you want to know why you
aren’t being paid right now, it is be-
cause the Democratic leader objected
to your getting a paycheck.
It is my hope that the Democratic
Senators will go to their leader and
say: This is a bad idea for Democratic
Senators to hold hostage the pay-
checks of the men and women of the
Coast Guard.
We should pay the Coast Guard, and
that ought to be something that com-
mands unanimous, bipartisan support.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I
want to make one other point after the
eloquent comments of my good friend
from Texas.
We have already done something
similar here. We are all breaking for
lunch right now. My Democratic col-
leagues are going to go do their strat-
egy sessions, and we are going to do
the same. I implore my Democratic
colleagues to go back to their leader
and say: Hey, come on. Let’s rethink
this. Here is why. We have already
done something similar.
I was on the floor when two of my
Democratic colleagues from Virginia
asked for unanimous consent on a bill.
Remember, the whole government was
partially shut down. There was a par-
tial government shutdown. They asked
for unanimous consent on a bill to
make sure that when the partial gov-
ernment shutdown was over, everybody
would receive backpay. We are actually
doing work on smaller but very impor-
tant issues. I was on the floor when
they did that. I certainly voted yes.
By the way, that went to the Presi-
dent. He said he was going to sign it,
and he signed it. That became a law
just about 2 weeks ago, as we have been
debating and trying to find a com-
promise.
So the notion that we are not doing
any work and that we are not passing
any laws that are impacting Federal
workers until the whole thing is over is
actually not true. We have already
done it.
This would be analogous to what we
did 2 weeks ago, and that was led by
the Democrats. The thing about this
Coast Guard bill right now is that it is
very, very bipartisan.
Mr. CRUZ. Would the Senator from
Alaska yield for a question?
Mr. SULLIVAN. Yes.
Mr. CRUZ. Did the bill that Senator
KENNEDY brought forward do any-
thing—anything else—beyond simply
paying the men and women of the
Coast Guard?
Mr. SULLIVAN. No, it just made it
so there was parity between the brave
men and women of the Coast Guard and
the brave men and women of the Army,

Navy, Air Force, and Marines—all of
whom are risking their lives for our
country and our citizens.
Right now, the men and women of
the Coast Guard are the only ones who
are not getting paid.
Mr. CRUZ. So if the Democrats had
not objected and it had passed and the
House had passed it and sent it to the
President, could we get the men and
women of the Coast Guard paid right
now, today, and get that passed into
law?
Mr. SULLIVAN. I think as soon as
possible we could get it passed.
I talked to the President on Wednes-
day. He said he was 100 percent behind
this bill, the way he was behind that
other bill to provide backpay to every-
body else who has been affected by the
partial government shutdown.
Mr. CRUZ. So the only thing that is
necessary to pass a clean bill, paying
the salaries of every man and women in
the Coast Guard, is for the Democratic
Senators to withdraw their objection;
is that correct?
Mr. SULLIVAN. That is correct.
Mr. CRUZ. Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado.
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, as
you know, I seldom rise on this floor to
contradict somebody on the other side.
Over the years, I have worked very
hard to work in a bipartisan way with
the Presiding Officer and with my Re-
publican colleagues, but these croco-
dile tears that the Senator from Texas
is crying for the first responders are
too hard for me to take.
They are too hard for me to take be-
cause when the Senator from Texas
shut this government down in 2013, my
State was flooded. It was under water.
People were killed. People’s houses
were destroyed. Their small businesses
were ruined forever. Because of the
Senator from Texas, this government
was shut down for politics.
He surfed to a second-place finish in
the Iowa caucuses but was of no help to
the first responders, to the teachers,
and to the students whose schools were
closed with a Federal Government that
was shut down because of the junior
Senator from Texas.
It is his business—not my business—
why he supports a President who wants
to erect a medieval barrier on the bor-
der of Texas, who wants to use eminent
domain to build that wall, and who
wants to declare an unconstitutional
emergency to build that wall. That is
the business of the Senator from Texas.
I can assure you that in Colorado if a
President said that he was going to use
eminent domain to erect a barrier
across the State of Colorado, across the
Rocky Mountains of Colorado, and he
was going to steal the property of our
farmers and ranchers to build his me-
dieval wall, there wouldn’t be an elect-
ed leader from our State who would
support that idea.
That comes to my final point—how
ludicrous it is that this government is
shut down over a promise the President
of the United States couldn’t keep and
that America is not interested in hav-
ing him keep. This idea that he was
going to build a medieval wall across
the southern border of Texas, taking it
from the farmers and ranchers who
were there, and have the Mexicans pay
for it isn’t true. That is why we are
here, because he is now saying the tax-
payers have to pay for it. That is not
what he said during his campaign.
Over and over he said that Mexico
would pay for the wall—over and over
again.
I was going to talk about what he
said about the junior Senator’s father,
but I am going to let that alone. It was
after that.
Now we are here with the govern-
ment shut down over his broken prom-
ise, while the Chinese are landing
spacecraft on the dark side of the
moon. That is what they are doing, not
to mention what they are doing in
Latin America and with their One Belt,
One Road Initiative in Asia. That is
what they are doing while we are shut
down over a promise he never thought
he could keep and didn’t keep.
Finally, this idea that my colleague
from Texas—and I am sorry to say this
because I respect him. He is obviously
a very intelligent person, but this idea
that Democrats are for open borders is
gibberish, and it is proven by what the
Senator from Louisiana said, which is
that time after time, we have sup-
ported real border security, not a wall
that Mexico pays for that gets you at-
tention at campaign rallies from some
people in America and that gets talked
about on FOX News at night.
In 2013, the Senator from Texas
didn’t support it. I did. In 2013, we
passed a bill here in a bipartisan way.
It got 68 votes. It had $46 billion for
border security in it—$46 billion, not $5
billion for his rinky-dink wall that he
is talking about building. There was
$46 billion for border security. To be
precise about it, it had 350 miles of
what the President now refers to as
steel slats.
By the way, America, do you hear
him not calling it a wall anymore?
Now it is steel slats. Now it is a bor-
der barrier. There were 350 miles of so-
called steel slats in that bill.
Do you know what else was in that
bill? I think the Presiding Officer voted
for that bill. In that bill, we doubled
the number of border security agents
on the border. They could practically
hold hands on that border. There were
so many border security agents in that
bill. We had billions of dollars of drone
technology so that we could learn what
we have learned in Afghanistan and in
other places, to see every single inch of
that border—every inch.
We had internal security in that bill
so that small businesses, farmers, and
ranchers don’t have to be the immigra-
tion police, and so that, finally, in
America we could actually know who
came here legally on a visa but over-
stayed their visa.
Forty percent of the people in this
country who are undocumented are
here because they came legally and
overstayed. We still can’t do that in
America because that bill passed the
Senate, but it couldn’t get a vote in
the House because of the stupidest rule
ever created, called the Hastert rule,
named after somebody who is in prison.
That rule has allowed a minority of ty-
rants in the Congress to bring a Demo-
cratic President low—President
Obama, whom they didn’t let do any-
thing—to ruin the speakership of John
Boehner, and to allow Paul Ryan to al-
most accomplish nothing while he was
Speaker, except leaving this place in a
government shutdown.
The so-called Freedom Caucus has
had a veto around this place for 10
years and completely distorted the Re-
publican Party here, if I do say so my-
self. That may sound presumptuous,
but I know a lot of Republicans in Col-
orado who don’t agree with almost
anything or anything that the Free-
dom Caucus has stood for. Yet they
have had a veto on good, bipartisan
legislation passed by the U.S. Senate.
So I am not going to stand here and
take it from somebody who has shut
down the government while my State
was flooded or from a President who
says that he wants $5 billion to build
some antiquated, medieval wall, which
he said Mexico would pay for, when I
helped write and voted for a bill that
actually would have secured the border
of the United States of America, that
would have secured our internal de-
fenses as well.
This is a joke, and the fact that it
consumes the cable networks all night,
every night, and all the rest of it—this
government should be open. We can de-
bate whatever it is we want to debate.
Do you think the Chinese don’t know
that we can’t land a spaceship on the
dark side of the moon? Do you think
the Russians don’t know that for the
first time since John Glenn was sent up
to orbit this planet, America cannot
put a person into space without asking
the Russians to do it? Do you think the
rest of the world doesn’t know that we
are not investing in our infrastructure;
that we are not investing in the young
generation of Americans; that we are
willing to lose the race for artificial in-
telligence to the Chinese; that we are
going to break all of our longstanding
alliances since World War II at a mo-
ment when China is rising; that Chi-
na’s GDP has quadrupled since 2001, tri-
pled since 2003, doubled since 2009? Do
we think that no one in the rest of the
world knows all of that about us?
We should reopen this government
today. We should reopen it today.
Then, what I hope much more than
that is that we actually come together
to figure out how we are going to gov-
ern this country again and stop playing
petty, partisan politics, which is going
to do nothing to educate the next gen-
eration of Americans, which is going to
do nothing to fix the fiscal condition of
this country.
For 10 years—for 10 years, I have
heard the junior Senator from Texas

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S553
January 24, 2019
and I have heard the Freedom Caucus
in the House of Representatives talk
about how important it is to get the
fiscal condition of our government
fixed. In fact, that has been the pretext
for shutdowns and for fiscal cliffs and
for all of this stuff that does nothing
but denigrate our democratic Republic.
Now, for the first time almost in his-
tory—it happened once before during
the Vietnam war—we are actually hav-
ing our deficit shooting through the
roof while unemployment has fallen. It
has never happened before. These are
the people who called Barack Obama a
Bolshevik and a socialist at the depths
of the recession, when we had a 10-per-
cent unemployment rate, and didn’t
lift a finger to do anything. They have
now given us a fiscal condition where
our deficit is going up while our unem-
ployment rate is falling. Do you know
how hard it is to accomplish that? Do
you know how irresponsible you would
have to be to accomplish that? Yet
that is what has been accomplished.
When I was first here—it was actu-
ally a little after I was first here—I
used to walk through Denver Inter-
national Airport, which we are very
proud of in Colorado. By the way, it is
the most recent airport that has been
constructed in America. While we have
been closed, other airports around the
world—new airports have been opened
just while we have been closed.
Denver International Airport is the
most recent airport in the country to
be opened. It was opened 25 years ago—
a quarter of a century ago—and during
moments like those when the Senator
from Texas shut down the government
while Colorado was underneath floods
and people had lost all of the things I
talked about earlier—their houses,
their jobs, and their lives—I used to
want to walk through that airport with
a paper bag over my head because I was
so embarrassed to be part of this.
I often wondered why anyone in their
right mind would want to work in a
place that has a 9-percent approval rat-
ing. In fact, I brought a chart—two
charts—one day to the floor, one that
showed we hadn’t always had a 9-per-
cent approval rating, to remind people
how far we had fallen in the public’s es-
timation over the time that the Sen-
ator from Texas and I have been here.
Then I brought out another chart that
looked at who else has a 9-percent ap-
proval rating. I can’t remember all—it
has sort of been lost in the mist of
time—but I do remember that the IRS
had a 40-percent approval rating; there
was an actress who had a 13-percent ap-
proval rating; more people wanted
America to be a Communist country—
11 percent—than approved of this Con-
gress; and Fidel Castro had a 5-percent
approval rating, which was lower than
our 9-percent approval rating. He was
the only one who had a lower rating
than that.
So my question, often, was this: Why
would anybody want to work in a place
that has such a low approval rating,
and why would they want to behave in
a way that only made matters worse?
I am sorry to say this, but there is an
answer. If you think you have been
sent here to dismantle the Federal
Government—and I have lots of prob-
lems with this Federal Government. I
think it does a lot of things very well,
and, as a westerner, I certainly believe
we need to not be in the business of de-
fending bad government. We need to be
improving the government. But if you
think your job is to dismantle it—as
the Freedom Caucus does, in my view—
then a 9-percent approval rating suits
you just fine because you get to go
home and say ‘‘See how terrible all of
those guys are? See what idiots all of
those guys are?’’ while you are taking
your pay while the Federal workers are
not getting paid, while you are keeping
your job while they are losing their
job.
There has been an effort not just to
dismantle the Federal Government but
to separate it from the American peo-
ple, to claim that it is someone else’s
or that it is corrupt. In many ways, I
think it is; I believe it is. I believe this
place is one of the most corrupt parts
of the whole thing. But because it is
corrupt or because it can’t get its act
together or because it is too far away
from the people or, I think I would say,
because it is populated by a bunch of
self-interested politicians who don’t
care about the priorities of the Amer-
ican people—whatever the reason is, it
is not separate. It is not separate. The
reason that is important is that we live
in a democratic Republic, and the
Founders of this country did two
things that had never happened in
human history: They led a successful
armed insurrection against a colonial
power in one generation, and they
formed a democratic Republic whose
Constitution was ratified by the people
who would live under it.
What they knew because they were
enlightened thinkers—or I should say
not what they knew but what they be-
lieved because they had only bad exam-
ples from which to draw when they sat
there in Philadelphia writing that Con-
stitution—but what they knew was
that in a Republic, we would have dis-
agreements. That was their expecta-
tion, and their belief was that out of
those disagreements we would—and, by
the way, they knew we would have dis-
agreements because they had disagree-
ments, and they had failed on some
very important things. It has to be
said. They perpetuated human slavery
because they couldn’t come to an
agreement about that, and other peo-
ple, whom I think of as Founders—just
as important, just as significant as
those Founders—ended the enslave-
ment of human beings in America and
did other important things, such as
make sure my daughters had the right
to vote. Those people also are Found-
ers. But what they believed at their
core was that through our disagree-
ments, we would forge more imagina-
tive and more durable solutions than
any King or tyrant could come up with
on their own. That was their belief.
That was their expectation.
I would say that our country, in
many ways, has eclipsed any expecta-
tion they ever had of what America
would become. For the moment, we are
the richest country in the world. We
have the greatest capacity for self-de-
fense of any human population in the
history of the world. We are far more
democratic and far more free, with all
of our imperfections, than they would
have ever imagined and probably than
most of them would have ever wanted.
We are the longest lived democracy in
human history. But, for some reason,
there is a generation of politicians in
America today who don’t think it is
necessary to live up to the standard
that they set and the standard lots of
other people have set from the found-
ing of our country 230 years ago until
today.
I don’t even know what day it is any-
more of this record-long shutdown, but
the pretext for it is an invention. It is
a creation of something in the Presi-
dent’s mind. It was something we have
learned from reading the press that
was a mnemonic device used during the
campaign to remind him to talk about
immigration in an effort to divide
Americans from one another instead of
an effort to bring us together, in an ef-
fort to turn what just 3 years ago was
a bipartisan issue in the Senate—secur-
ing our southern border with $46 bil-
lion—into a cudgel to be wielded at
campaign rallies.
In any case, the least we could do
while we have these shabby disagree-
ments that are not worthy of our pred-
ecessors, that are not worthy of the
State I represent—which is one-third
Democratic, one-third Republican, and
one-third Independent—that are
threatening to make our generation
the first generation of Americans to
leave less opportunity, not more, to
the people coming after us, a genera-
tion of politicians who are openly sug-
gesting that America’s role in the
world should be diminished—the least
we could do is reopen our government
and stop pursuing this self-inflicted
harm that it creates in having hun-
dreds of thousands of Federal workers
out of work and not being paid, not
able to support their families while we
continue to stand on this floor, having
mindless arguments that are going to
do nothing to advance the future of our
country.
We shouldn’t shut the government
down, as it has been in this case, for a
campaign promise the President, I am
sure, knew he could never keep.
With that, I yield floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms.
ERNST). The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, there is
an old saying in Texas among Texas
trial lawyers. If you have the facts, you
bang the facts. If you have the law, you
bang the law. If you don’t have either
one, you bang the table. We have seen
a whole lot of table banging right here
on this floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S554 January 24, 2019
great deal of time attacking me per-
sonally. He did at one point briefly rise
to the defense of my father. I appre-
ciate that gesture, but he spent a lot of
time yelling.
I will say, in my time in the Senate,
I don’t believe I have ever bellowed or
yelled at one of my colleagues on the
Senate floor, and I hope in my time be-
fore me, I never do that. I think we
should discuss issues and substance and
facts and not simply scream and yell at
each other.
Let’s go over some of the facts. In
the angry speech of the Senator from
Colorado, he did not dispute, No. 1,
that he and every other Senate Demo-
crat in 2013 voted for 350 miles of bor-
der wall. That is a fact. He has voted
for 350 miles of border wall, as did
every other Democrat in this Chamber
at that time.
No. 2, he did not dispute that in De-
cember of last year, the then-Repub-
lican House of Representatives voted to
fund the government—to fund the en-
tirety of the government—and to se-
cure the border, and the Senator from
Colorado, and I believe every other
Democrat, filibustered that bill and
caused the shutdown.
I voted to take up that bill. You
voted to take up that bill. Had we
taken up the bill, had we simply passed
the bill the House of Representatives
had passed funding the government and
securing the border, the government
would never have shut down.
It takes some degree of chutzpah to
stand up, after filibustering funding for
the government, as the Democrats did,
and blame the shutdown on the oppos-
ing party.
The Senator from Colorado did not
dispute the Republican House voted to
fund the government, and he and his
Democratic colleagues filibustered
that, which caused the shutdown.
No. 3, the Senator from Colorado did
not dispute that the stated reason the
Democrats filibustered that bill is be-
cause it authorized the funding of 234
miles of wall.
I have to say, I find it amusing that
a new adjective has crept in. It is now
not 234 miles of wall; it is medieval
wall. I don’t know if there is something
in there that has a moat and has cata-
pults that are throwing burning tar—
medieval wall now.
It is kind of an odd thing. It does
raise the question: Well, if walls are
medieval, why did the Senator from
Colorado and every other Democrat in
2013 vote for 350 miles of medieval wall?
To the extent walls are medieval, they
presumably were medieval in 2013, just
as much as they are now.
The President has a good observa-
tion. He said: I will tell you something
else that is medieval, the wheel. There
is a reason the wheel is medieval—be-
cause it rolls things, and it works.
Walls are effective.
Unlike the Senator from Colorado, I
live in a border State. We have 1,200
miles of border. I have spent a great
deal of time down at the border with
Border Patrol agents. We have miles
and miles of wall right now that are
working. I have been to those walls—
not once, not twice but over and over
again.
One of the rich things about this
Chamber is, Senators from States no-
where near the border presume to lec-
ture border States about what it is like
on the border and what works securing
the border. Walls are effective. I will
tell you, every single Border Patrol
agent I have asked——and I have asked
dozens, probably hundreds of Border
Patrol agents—are walls effective, un-
questionably, they say yes.
Let’s not destruct the straw man.
Walls are not the only thing. You need
technology. You need boots on the
ground. You need all sorts of other
tools. The critical point in intercepting
someone crossing over illegally is the
time between detection and intercep-
tion, and what a wall does is slows
down the traffickers to give the Border
Patrol time to intercept them.
By the way, we have seen it over and
over again in San Diego. When they
built the wall, the illegal traffic plum-
meted. In El Paso, when they built the
wall, the illegal traffic plummeted.
Now the Democrats’ position is not
substantive. They voted for 350 miles of
wall. So why are they shutting the gov-
ernment down over 234 miles of wall? It
is not substantive; it is political.
We get that they hate Donald Trump.
If anyone in America had missed that
point—that they really don’t like this
man—their yelling and screaming and
bellowing has made that abundantly
clear. Just because you hate somebody
doesn’t mean you should shut down the
government. I voted to keep this gov-
ernment open, right now, today. The
Democrats are filibustering funding for
the government.
Let me tell you something else the
Senator from Colorado didn’t dispute.
We had a whole colloquy with the Sen-
ator from Louisiana and the Senator
from Mississippi and the Senator from
Alaska about funding the Coast Guard.
Did you notice, in that entire bel-
lowing speech, the words ‘‘Coast
Guard’’ were never uttered? Not once.
What Senator KENNEDY asked this
body to do was pass a clean bill to pay
the paychecks of the Coast Guard. Sen-
ator KENNEDY’s bill doesn’t mention a
wall—whether you like one or not, it
doesn’t mention a medieval wall or any
other kind. It simply says: Pay the
Coast Guard—yes, no.
Every Republican agrees, pay the
Coast Guard right now. It is not fair to
treat the Coast Guard differently than
we are treating the Army and Navy and
Marines and Air Force.
The Senator from Colorado didn’t ad-
dress that because it is indisputable, it
is a fact that the reason that didn’t
pass right now is because the Demo-
cratic leader stood up and made an ob-
jection.
By implication, every Democratic
Senator presumably agrees with it. The
fact that the Senator from Colorado
didn’t say, yes, we should fund the
Coast Guard, and, you know what, my
leader was wrong when he held the pay-
checks of the Coast Guard’s men and
women hostage because he wants to
win a political fight with the Presi-
dent.
By the way, I would note to the Sen-
ator of Colorado, it is not the end of
the world to stand up to your party’s
leader. Some of us have a history of
having done so in the past.
We are now in the longest govern-
ment shutdown in history. This shut-
down needs to end—the American peo-
ple want it to end—but we also need to
secure the border.
I have to say, the contrast between
the two parties could not be clearer.
The President has repeatedly said he
wants to negotiate and compromise. He
says he is willing to meet in the mid-
dle. He hasn’t insisted on every mile of
border wall he asked for. He hasn’t in-
sisted on every single dollar of border
security. He said: Let’s meet and com-
promise. Republicans on this side of
the Chamber have said: Let’s com-
promise in the middle.
The position of Senate Democrats is
that they will not negotiate; they will
not compromise, period. Their position,
how many miles of wall can be built?
Zero. They are not to 1 yet. When it
comes to negotiating, their position is
not an inch of wall can be built, even
though we the Democrats already
voted for 350 miles of it. Why? Because
Donald Trump is President.
That is an extreme and radical posi-
tion. Look, I understand, folks watch-
ing at home, it is hard to tell—you are
reading the news. It seems like both
parties are bickering. It is hard to tell
what is happening, particularly be-
cause on the Senate floor, there is a lot
of procedural mumbo jumbo.
If you want to understand what is
going on, the exchange between Sen-
ator KENNEDY and Senator SCHUMER il-
lustrates it all. Senator KENNEDY’s bill
did one thing and one thing only. It
paid the salaries of the men and women
of the Coast Guard. It didn’t touch any
other issue.
Every Republican agrees with that
bill. The Democrats objected and said:
We will not pay the Coast Guard.
Had they not objected, we could put
that bill on the President’s desk today,
and they could get their paychecks
right now. That is emblematic of the
approach of Senate Democrats.
When the Senator from Colorado
stopped screaming at me, he then en-
gaged in a bit of historical retrospec-
tive about the great Framers of our
Constitution, which I enjoyed and very
much agree with. I am someone who
spent a lifetime devoted to the Con-
stitution. I am inspired by the Framers
who gave us this extraordinary demo-
cratic Republic. The Senator from Col-
orado called for Members of this body
to aspire to be more like the men and
women who gave us this country, gave
us this Republic, if you can keep it, as
Benjamin Franklin put it. I concur
with that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S555
January 24, 2019
What I urge the Senator from Colo-
rado do is to reach out to his Demo-
cratic colleagues and counsel com-
promise. I am urging my colleagues on
this side to do the same. The difference
is, the Republicans are willing to com-
promise, have offered to compromise,
and, in fact, just now sought to pay the
Coast Guard, and the Democratic posi-
tion is: No, no, no. We object.
That is partisan, it is extreme, and it
is not behavior that would bring pride
to the Framers of our Constitution. I
hope this body can do better.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado.
Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator
from Texas for having this conversa-
tion. I don’t think I was yelling—but I
will go watch the tape—or screaming
at you. I also have never called any-
body on this floor a liar, as you did, in
2015. I get the theatrics of all of this.
I guess I want to say two things. One,
I appreciate the fact that you, at least,
seem to be accepting the fact that
every Democrat who is here, on that
immigration bill in 2013, voted for it—
voted for the 350 miles of wall you are
talking about. You didn’t vote for that
bill or the Senator from Texas didn’t
vote for that bill, and I assume you had
your reasons.
By the way, I wouldn’t presume to
think what the Senator would think
about as a person from a border State.
My State is not far from the border. We
see the effects for ill and for good of
immigration in my State.
I do know this. There were two Sen-
ators from a border State—the border
State of Arizona—who were on that
Gang of 8 bill, with whom I sat, day
after day, negotiating the provisions
for months. They didn’t have to just
vote for the bill or against it, but they
had to go home to Arizona—John
McCain and Jeff Flake did—and ex-
plain why they supported it and why it
was the right thing to do for Arizona,
which, as the Senator from Texas
knows, is a border State.
The idea that there is a problem to
be solved here because Democrats in
this Chamber are for open borders is
false, as the Senator indicated. The
second point is, the Senator from
Texas referenced Ben Franklin.
Ben Franklin was standing outside
the steps of Constitution Hall, and
somebody who was passing by—this is
while they were writing the Constitu-
tion—said: Mr. Franklin, what kind of
government are you creating—a mon-
archy or a republic?
That was the question. As Senator
CRUZ has said, his answer was ‘‘a Re-
public, if you can keep it’’—if you can
keep it. His answer was not ‘‘a Repub-
lic’’; it was ‘‘a Republic, if you can
keep it,’’ because he knew that the
words written in the Constitution
weren’t going to preserve themselves,
that this exercise in democratic self-
government, a democratic republic,
would require generations of women
and men—not just in this Chamber but
as citizens and I would say as found-
ers—to keep the Republic they created.
That is what is at stake here. That is
what is at stake when the government
has been shut down for politics, when
we have a President who doesn’t be-
lieve in the rule of law, who attacks
judges whose decisions he disagrees
with, who attacks the free press, who
have that freedom because of the Con-
stitution and the Bill of Rights.
It is that Republic which is at risk
when we are not educating the next
generation of Americans, when we are
not investing in our infrastructure,
when we have the unbelievable and un-
precedented fiscal hypocrisy that has
resulted in a ballooning deficit while
the unemployment rate is going down.
It is a farce. It is a farce.
My closing word is to say that I will
work with anybody—including the Sen-
ator from Texas, if he will work with
me—to put this sorry episode behind
us. And I don’t mean this sorry episode
of this government shutdown, although
that is a sorry and pathetic episode,
but this episode of American political
history where we have done so little for
the next generation of Americans and
done almost nothing to honor the leg-
acy of our parents and grandparents
and the people who came before them.
That would be worth doing around this
place before we all die.
With that, Madam President, I yield
the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, let’s
put this in realistic terms. I have been
here through eight Presidents. I am
now in my 45th year. I have never seen
anything like the Trump shutdown
from the day it began 34 days ago until
now.
I hear from people every day about
the pain and suffering this shutdown
has caused. Certainly I hear from my
home State of Vermont. We know that
tomorrow hundreds of thousands of
public servants will miss their second
paycheck since this shutdown began.
Many of these public servants have had
to work the entire time. They are
angry. They are confused about why
their paychecks are being held hostage
by the President in what he appears to
view as a political game. Many of these
people can no longer pay their bills.
They are worried about what tomorrow
will bring, and all of us should worry.
We know that our basic government
services are no longer functioning. Our
Federal courts will run out of money
by the end of this month. Important
scientific research has been put on
hold. Think of the cost to turn it back
on. The fishing industry is in turmoil
because they cannot get the Federal
permits or inspections required to take
out their boats. In the wake of a
record-setting fire season, the Forest
Service has curtailed thinning and fire-
prevention projects. Federal law en-
forcement and prosecutors are sound-
ing the alarm that the shutdown is hin-
dering important investigative work
and criminal prosecutions. The Trans-
portation Security Administration,
TSA, has employees who are calling in
sick in record numbers after a month
of being on the job with no paycheck.
Some even say they cannot pay for the
gas to get to the job. These are the peo-
ple charged with detecting dangerous
threats at our Nation’s airports. In-
stead, they are stressed and frustrated.
Everybody knows that is not a very
good combination. Long lines are form-
ing at airports. A lack of TSA employ-
ees has forced some major airports to
close screening areas, causing further
delays.
I could go on and on, but we know
the Trump shutdown is hurting our Na-
tion and our citizens. Overseas, it
makes the United States of America
look weak and foolish. This great coun-
try is made to look weak and foolish by
the Trump shutdown.
We can end it right now, today, and
for the sake of the country, we should.
The McConnell amendment, the so-
called End the Shutdown and Reopen
the Government Act, we all know is a
nonstarter. I came to the floor yester-
day, and I detailed why. I am not going
to repeat that here today.
It is the height of irresponsibility to
use the pain and suffering of the Amer-
ican people as leverage to force the
U.S. taxpayers to fund the President’s
bumper-sticker, campaign slogan
southern border wall—on his solemn
promise that Mexico would pay for it—
or to enact his hard-line, anti-immi-
grant agenda. That is what the bill
does. It is not a compromise. It is not
a deal. I hope my fellow Senators op-
pose it. If we give in to these tactics
now, where will it stop? What is the
next thing the President will shut
down the government over?
H.R. 268, which is what the Schumer
amendment contains, is a bipartisan
bill that we should all support. It
would reopen the government by ex-
tending funding for the seven remain-
ing appropriations bills through Feb-
ruary 8, 2019. Remember, those are ap-
propriations bills that Chairman
SHELBY and I worked very hard on and
that passed through the committee vir-
tually unanimously. We ought to ap-
plaud that. The passage of the bill will
ensure that Federal employees are paid
and that critical services are restored
and provide time for negotiation and
debate on border security without the
American people being held hostage to
the President’s ill-considered, anti-im-
migrant agenda. I urge Senators to
vote for it.
On December 19, in this Chamber, we
passed the bill to fund the government
until February 8. We did it unani-
mously by a voice vote. Republicans
were in charge of both the House and
the Senate at that time. In other
words, the Senate was for keeping the
government open. The President’s own
Republican leaders supported it. Sud-
denly, he changed his mind, and the
Republican leaders had to back off.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S556 January 24, 2019
H.R. 268 also provides $14 billion in
assistance to help communities and
families impacted by natural disasters
recover and rebuild. It provides assist-
ance to the victims of Hurricanes Mi-
chael and Florence, the California
wildfires, the volcanic eruptions in Ha-
waii, the recent typhoons in the Pa-
cific, and other natural disasters. It
will also continue assistance for Puerto
Rico, which is still recovering from the
category 5 Hurricanes Maria and Irma.
The McConnell amendment contains
a disaster package nearly identical to
H.R. 268, but to appease the President,
it eliminates all disaster assistance for
Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is part of
America. I know the President referred
to it as an island surrounded by water,
as though that is the only island that
is surrounded by water. The McConnell
amendment eliminates $1.3 billion in
funding for clean and safe drinking
water grants, community redevelop-
ment funds, and nutrition assistance
that would help the American citizens
of Puerto Rico continue their recovery.
Hurricanes Maria and Irma dev-
astated Puerto Rico and destroyed the
island’s homes and infrastructure. Hur-
ricane Maria caused the deaths of 2,975
Americans. It is one of the deadliest
hurricanes this country has ever seen.
While Congress has provided Puerto
Rico with assistance in past disaster
bills, they still have unaddressed needs
that have to be met. Absent supple-
mental assistance, it is estimated that
140,000 Puerto Ricans—and I have to re-
emphasize that they are all U.S. citi-
zens—are going to lose nutrition assist-
ance at the end of March. This in the
United States of America? Is there any
wonder that the rest of the world looks
at us and says: What are you doing? We
are supposed to take care of all of our
citizens when there is a crisis, not pick
and choose based on who we are or who
we are aligned with politically.
Just as I voted for disaster aid in
States represented by Republicans, Re-
publicans have voted for disaster aid in
my State when it has been represented
by Democrats. The President’s dis-
regard for the victims of Hurricane
Maria is shameful.
I urge Senators to vote aye on the
Schumer amendment. It provides much
needed assistance to disaster-affected
communities, and it immediately al-
lows us to send this bill to the Presi-
dent to reopen the government. It has
gone on long enough.
The President and the people in his
Cabinet are billionaires. They do not
care about the harm he has inflicted on
this country, but I know Members of
this body, both Democrats and Repub-
licans, do. We know what it means to
govern. We have a responsibility to do
it now.
Senator SHELBY, whom I admire, is a
friend of mine. He and I worked to-
gether last year in a bipartisan way.
We got the appropriations process back
on track. We showed that this is the
way to get things done. But then the
President decided to take us off course.
The Senate is an independent, co-
equal branch of government. We should
act like it. Let’s end this national
nightmare. Let’s vote to open the gov-
ernment now for our fellow Americans.
Let’s do it now, today.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama.
Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, just
a few months ago, we stood here on the
Senate floor celebrating the progress
we had made together in the appropria-
tions process, as Senator LEAHY has
just alluded to. I believe we are all
tired of lurching from crisis to crisis
amid partisan bickering. Both sides re-
solved then to put aside partisan dif-
ferences and work together for the
good of the American people, and it
worked.
Together, we funded 75 percent of the
government on time. While we would
have preferred to have funded 100 per-
cent, it was considerably more progress
than we had made in decades. Yet we
find ourselves here today more than 1
month into the longest partial shut-
down of the government in American
history. It is enough to give you whip-
lash.
Funding the remaining 25 percent of
government is a task before us here
today. Homeland security, border secu-
rity, is the linchpin. We know that. Are
our differences really as insurmount-
able as they seem? They should not be,
and I want to discuss why.
Last May, the Appropriations Com-
mittee considered the fiscal year 2019
Homeland Security bill. That bill in-
cluded money for a physical barrier at
the southern border. In fact, it in-
cluded an increase in funding over the
2018 level for a physical barrier.
Our Democratic colleagues made no
attempt to strike this funding, just as
Republicans made no effort to strike
funding for Democratic priorities in
the bill. The bill passed with over-
whelming bipartisan support in the
committee—a vote of 26 to 5. There
were no fireworks or histrionics in the
hearing room that day. There was no
demand to delay the Homeland Secu-
rity bill until the rest of the Federal
Government was funded. Rather, the
committee simply decided together, on
a bipartisan basis, to increase funding
for a project that Congress funded the
previous year. The fireworks and de-
mands for delayed consideration came
later.
It boggles the mind at times how we
return so quickly to a standoff mode—
to a zero-sum mentality—after making
so much progress together. It is par-
ticularly perplexing to me considering
bipartisan support is exactly what
underpinned the very thing that now
divides us so bitterly.
Just a few months ago, funding for a
physical barrier in the southern border
was part of a bipartisan deal, and now
we cannot even really discuss it. That
was then. I understand that. But where
do we go from here? Who is offering
real solutions, comprehensive solutions
to end this impasse?
The President, for his part, has pro-
posed a serious and, I think, a reason-
able compromise—a comprehensive so-
lution. I commend him for that. He is
doing what the American people ex-
pect, I think, showing a willingness to
work together to find common ground.
I encourage my Democratic col-
leagues to reciprocate here. We have in
the past. If this proposal today is unac-
ceptable, I ask my colleagues on the
other side to put something on the
table that could help move us off the
dime. Work with us. Propose a com-
prehensive solution to get us moving in
the right direction. But simply saying
no, demanding that we deal with bor-
der security later, is not going to cut it
today.
What do we do about solving our cri-
sis? This is a real crisis. If not now,
when? When will be the time to secure
the border? What good will more time
or talking do?
The American people have been
promised that border security will
come later since the Simpson-Mazzoli
amnesty in 1986. Look at where we are
today—still waiting, still talking. The
drug smuggling, the human trafficking,
and the chaos are a real crisis. We
know what must be done. It is a ques-
tion of what will be done.
I say this afternoon in the Senate,
let’s come together. Let’s put the bit-
terness behind us and do what is right
for the American people—end the shut-
down and secure the border. The real
question before us today is this: Is this
the beginning of the end or is it just
the end of the beginning? We shall find
out.

ator from Vermont.

gest the absence of a quorum.

dent’s proposal and one on a 2-week
continuing resolution that opens up
the government, with disaster assist-
ance.
Let me be clear: The two votes are
not alike. The President’s proposal
makes radical changes to our asylum
laws and demands that American tax-
payers fund a border wall in exchange
for reopening the government. The sec-
ond vote demands nothing—no partisan
demands, no ransom. It reopens the
government for 2 weeks and provides
long overdue disaster aid, and then it
leaves room for us to debate how to
best secure our border.
My Republican friends can fall in line
behind the President if they choose,
but it does not have the support of the
House or the Senate. Contrary to what

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S557
January 24, 2019
the Republican leader says, that there
is only one bill that will become law,
that is not so. His bill will not pass the
Senate and will not pass the House. It
is not the only way for us to make a
law.
After the first vote fails, Republicans
will have a chance to vote with us to
reopen their government. The second
vote determines whether you want to
reopen the government or not. The sec-
ond vote determines whether you are
willing to reopen the government with-
out taking hostages, without hurting
800,000 workers, and without hurting
America but open the government with
no conditions. We can send that bill to
the President’s desk. It has already
passed the House.
The President may choose to veto it,
just as we may choose to override that
veto. My dear friend from Louisiana
missed that point. If we act with 67
votes, even if the President doesn’t like
it, it can pass.
We all know it was the President who
threw us into this turmoil when he
changed his mind and opposed a bill to
reopen the government without condi-
tions—just like the one we offered in
December and the House wouldn’t go
forward with, even though the Senate
voted for it unanimously.
Our bill should not be controversial.
Our amendment is nearly the same bill
Republicans all voted for a month ago.
It shows that the one cause of this
shutdown is the one person who
bragged he wanted it—President Don-
ald Trump.
Last month, the Senate unanimously
passed the short-term bill to keep the
government open. It was Leader
MCCONNELL’s idea. Everyone thought
the President would support it, but
President Trump buckled to the most
extreme voices in his party and re-
versed his position at the eleventh
hour. That is how the government
shutdown began, sadly and unfortu-
nately. Since then, we tried to nego-
tiate with the administration to no
avail. When the President’s deputies
made offers, the President almost im-
mediately retracted them. The Presi-
dent even rejected an idea by Senator
GRAHAM, one of his staunchest allies in
the Senate, to reopen government tem-
porarily while we debate border secu-
rity.
Now the President is back with a
‘‘straw man’’ proposal, as the Senator
from Oklahoma called it, that makes
the same demand he has been making
all along: $5.7 billion taxpayer dollars
for a border wall he promised Mexico
would pay for, and it adds a new rad-
ical change to our asylum laws. What
the President calls concessions to
Democrats are the protections for
DACA and TPS recipients that the
President himself rescinded and have
been subsequently protected by the
court.
Calling this a reasonable compromise
is laughable. It is a starkly partisan
proposal that perfectly encapsulates
the President’s hostage-taking of the
American government. This is what
the President could be saying in this
bill: Give me everything I want in ex-
change for reopening the government.
A vote for the President’s plan is very
simply an endorsement of government
by extortion. Enough is enough.
I know that many of my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle agree
with me. They understand that holding
our government workers hostage for a
policy goal is no way to govern. I know
they feel that way. I urge them to vote
yes on the second vote.
Supporting our amendment doesn’t
mean you don’t support stronger bor-
der security. To the contrary, it starts
funding that effort once again. Voting
for this amendment means you agree
with the vast majority of the American
people that the government should
open without precondition. Voting for
this amendment means you recognize
that holding millions of Americans
hostage is not a way to run our govern-
ment. Voting for this amendment
means that you believe members of the
Coast Guard, the TSA, the DHS, and
the FBI should be paid for their work
protecting our country. Voting for this
amendment means you support our air
traffic controllers, food inspectors, and
the men and women who work at our
national parks. And yes, voting for this
amendment means that you support
border security. It means you support a
way out of this shutdown where we can
sit down and rationally hash out our
differences. If we can’t do that, if we
can’t agree today that the way to solve
disagreements over policy is through
debate and consideration in Congress
where it belongs, then we are staring
down a very long and very dark tunnel.
Our system of government was de-
signed to allow space for disagree-
ments, even vociferous ones, but when
one side—in this case, the President—
uses the basic functioning of our gov-
ernment as leverage to extract policy
concessions, our entire system of gov-
ernment breaks down. It is a recipe for
gridlock, dysfunction, and paralysis,
not only now but on into the future.
I believe there are men and women of
good faith on both sides of the aisle
who want to see this senselessness
come to an end today. Let the Senate
come together now. Let the Senate rise
to the occasion as it has done so often
in the past. Vote yes on the second
amendment. Open the people’s govern-
ment.
I yield the floor.

The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that following my
remarks, the Senator from Wisconsin,
Mr. JOHNSON, be recognized for 5 min-
utes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object because we had
floor time immediately after my friend
from Texas, could you give us an idea
of how much time you will be using on
the floor before we have the time—we
were supposed to come immediately
after you. That is my reason for raising
that issue.
Mr. CORNYN. I promise my friend
from Maryland that I will be less than
an hour. I am kidding. I am kidding. I
will try to wrap it up in 10 or 15 min-
utes, max.
Mr. CARDIN. There are about 15 Sen-
ators who are waiting for the time. We
were originally supposed to start at
3:30. Now we are starting later. I know
Senators are going to be inconven-
ienced. Some have commitments.
I will remove my objection. I really
want it understood that we thought we
would be starting our time before that.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, re-
sponding to our friend from Maryland,
I understand the situation. We will try
to figure out how to accommodate all
Senators so that they get a chance to
speak.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, since
the shutdown began, we have heard
voices on both sides of the aisle, mine
included, calling for a bipartisan solu-
tion to fund the government and end
this stalemate. With Speaker PELOSI
and Minority Leader SCHUMER refusing
to come to the negotiating table, they
made finding common ground much
harder than it needs to be.
This weekend, President Trump made
a serious proposal that would deliver
on priorities that are important to
both parties—Republicans and Demo-
crats—in bringing this partial govern-
ment shutdown to an end.
The bill we voted on today contains
key provisions to border security and
to make improvements to our immi-
gration system as a whole. As we have
heard from the Border Patrol experts
time and again, we need sensible solu-
tions, which, along the border, consist
of three components: its physical bar-
riers in some locations, its technology
in others, and personnel in others—or
some combination of those three.
President Trump himself has said he
understands there doesn’t need to be a
wall from sea to shining sea, and he
has acknowledged the role of tech-
nology and personnel and border secu-
rity. We need to prevent the illegal
movement of goods and people without
inhibiting legitimate trade and travel.
I wish to show colleagues one exam-
ple of a physical barrier in Texas that
was voted on in a bond election in Hi-
dalgo County, TX. These are folks who
live on the border. They voted to pay
for this levee wall. The reason? Be-
cause they knew the levee system had
to be improved in order to get insur-
ance companies to write insurance so
that they could build and develop the
property in Hidalgo County, TX.
They also talked to the Border Pa-
trol about what the Border Patrol
needed to control the movement of ille-
gal immigration across the border, and
they came up with a win-win propo-
sition—a levee wall, which is appro-
priate at this particular location. This
was voted on as a bond election by the
voters in Hidalgo County, TX, and did
not involve spending any Federal
money.
My simple point is, there are solu-
tions that can be worked out if we con-
sult the experts—the Border Patrol—to
find out what exactly they need for
border security that will meet with
public approval along the border and
represent a win-win.
Recently, when the President was in
McAllen, TX, Senator CRUZ—my col-
league from Texas—and I had a meet-
ing with mayors and county judges
after the President’s entourage left to
come back to Washington, DC. I re-
member specifically my friend, Judge
Eddie Trevino, the county judge of
Cameron County, TX—that is where
Brownsville, TX, is—who said: If it is
the Border Patrol and Customs and
Border Protection telling us what we
need in order to secure the border, we
are all in. But if it is people in Wash-
ington, DC, making political judg-
ments, politicians trying to micro-
manage how the border can be secured,
we remain deeply skeptical.
I think those wise words ought to
guide us in our discussions going for-
ward. Not only did the legislation that
embodied the President’s proposal in-
vest in critical components along the
border, it included more than $1 billion
for improvements and personnel at our
ports of entry.
If you talk to anybody who knows
anything about the movement of ille-
gal drugs—heroin, methamphetamine,
fentanyl—across the border, most of it
comes through the port of entry, em-
bedded in trucks and trailers and per-
sonal vehicles. We need more tech-
nology in order to scan those vehicles

January 24, 2019
in secondary review. In order to detect
them, deter them, interdict them, we
need the personnel to be able to do that
without impeding legitimate trade and
travel.
These are priorities I have long advo-
cated for, based on feedback from the
experts—the law enforcement officers,
community leaders, and folks who live
and work along the Texas-Mexico bor-
der every day.
As we all know, the challenges that
exist within our immigration system
don’t end at our borders. With a court
backlog of roughly 800,000 cases deep,
nearly 1 million people living in the
United States with temporary legal
status, and the loopholes that make
enforcing some of our immigration
laws nearly impossible, there is much
more that needs to be done. That is
why this legislation includes provisions
to build the foundation of real immi-
gration reform—something heralded by
both parties.
This bill generously granted provi-
sional status to current DACA and
temporary protected status recipients,
who live each day not knowing if or
when they would be forced to leave the
United States. It does not offer a path
to citizenship or a long-term solution.
I wish we could do that, but we don’t
have a long-term solution. It does pro-
vide stability for 3 years while Con-
gress works on a legislative fix.
This is far from a solution to the per-
vasive problems in our immigration
system, but it is a start. A journey of
1,000 miles begins with a single step.
This represents a first step. Most im-
portantly, though, this legislation
funds the Departments and Agencies
that have been shuttered since Decem-
ber 22. This shutdown may have begun
as a battle for border security, but it
affects men and women in all 50 States
whose jobs have nothing to do with
border security at all, people at the De-
partment of Agriculture, the Justice
Department, the Interior Department,
Housing and Urban Development,
Treasury, the National Space and Aer-
onautics Agency, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Food and Drug
Administration, and the Peace Corps.
All of the people working for each of
these government Agencies are work-
ing without pay or have been fur-
loughed. Not only is the partial shut-
down impacting the critical work being
done by these Departments and Agen-
cies, it is harming the dedicated men
and women who work at them, those
tasked with executing and enforcing
laws written by this very body.
Since this shutdown began 34 days
ago, nearly 800,000 Federal workers
have lost the security of knowing when
their next paycheck will come. Tomor-
row is the second paycheck they will
miss, meaning they have now gone
more than a month without income.
Yesterday, when I was in Austin and
then in Dallas, I was told that people
who routinely volunteer their time at
the food banks in those locations now
find themselves going to the food
banks and seeking food so they can
feed their families because they are
missing a government paycheck and
can’t provide for them without the gen-
erosity of those food banks.
I also went to events in Austin and
Dallas and met with U.S. attorneys in
both locations to talk about our efforts
to counter human trafficking and child
exploitation. What I learned is that the
frontline prosecutors who prosecute
these kinds of cases aren’t being paid,
but maybe more troublesome is the
fact that neither are the FBI agents
who conduct the investigations or the
administrative personnel who support
the U.S. attorneys offices. So this is
harming our ability to investigate and
prosecute human trafficking and child
exploitation cases too. People are
being forced to work without pay, and
it is harming not only them but also
the victims of these horrific crimes.
More than 110,000 of these unpaid
Federal workers earn less than $50,000 a
year, and they rely on their paycheck
to make ends meet. They are not mil-
lionaires. While we did pass legislation
to guarantee that these public servants
will eventually get their pay, that does
nothing to help them in the interim.
Federal workers are being forced to
make decisions that no family should
have to consider. For a single mom
who is a Federal correctional officer in
Arizona, that means turning off her
heat, never letting the temperature get
higher than 60 or 65 degrees in order to
cut costs. For a mom in Wisconsin who
works at the Department of the Inte-
rior, that means rationing her insulin
because she can’t afford the $300 copay.
This shutdown is deeply impacting
thousands of Federal workers and their
families all across the country, includ-
ing Texas. One Texan who works at the
Internal Revenue Service says he has
been sleeping in so he only has to
worry about eating two meals a day,
not three. One woman whose husband
is in the Coast Guard drove from Gal-
veston to Ellington Field in Houston—
about 40 miles each way—to pick up
free diapers for their kids.
On a recent trip home, I heard spe-
cific examples of the impact this shut-
down has had on the Department of
Justice, which I mentioned just a mo-
ment ago, and the heartbreaking chal-
lenges they are facing every day. These
dedicated men and women have chosen
their careers in public service. They
want to go to work. They want to be
able to pay their bills. It is time for us
to do our job so they can do theirs with
the dignity and the pay they earn.
I want to remind all our colleagues
that our constituents did not send us
to Washington so we could simply vote
no on a less than perfect piece of legis-
lation. If that were the case, we would
never get anything done here. We were
elected to work with our colleagues to
create legislation so we can get to yes,
to build consensus, and to solve prob-
lems, not to score political points.
Are there certain pieces of legisla-
tion that I don’t agree with? Of
course—parts of this legislation we just
voted on. But it does fund priorities
critical to our southern border and to
the people of Texas. Right now, this is
the only bill I have seen that includes
priorities of both parties and that car-
ries the President’s support.
I voted for this legislation to support
the men and women who have been
treated as collateral damage through-
out this unnecessary government shut-
down, those who are forced to apply for
food stamps or unemployment who
would rather be working, who can’t
pay their medical bills or for childcare,
who not only want this shutdown to
end but need for this shutdown to end.
We aren’t here to hold show votes on
legislation the President won’t sign.
Just ask the elementary school civics
students, and they can tell you that is
not how a bill becomes a law.
This was a serious offer by the Presi-
dent to end this shutdown and build
the trust and good will necessary to
have real reform, and I am dis-
appointed that our colleagues voted
against this bill. That was a vote not
on the merits of the President’s pro-
posal; that was a vote to get on the bill
so it could be amended. In other words,
our colleagues who voted against the
bill aren’t even interested in having a
conversation about how we solve this
problem and how we find our way out
of this boxed canyon. Unfortunately,
there are those who, for political rea-
sons, continue to lack any interest in
negotiating a compromise bill that
could earn bipartisan support.
We solve difficult problems every day
in the U.S. Congress on a bipartisan
basis—every single day—but somehow
we have decided we can’t solve this
problem. And I fear that is not because
of the difficulty of the problem pre-
sented; it is because of the politics that
have paralyzed us and made it impos-
sible for us to bridge our differences.
I thank the President for this com-
prehensive offer and the majority lead-
er for bringing it to the floor so we
could vote on it. I would urge all of our
colleagues, now that we have had these
two failed votes—we know we are right
where we started when we got here
today—to work together to try to
bridge our differences, to build con-
sensus, and end this shutdown.

S560 January 24, 2019
in the shutdown politics, which I don’t
agree with, and they are not getting
paid. It is a basic principle that we
should pay these individuals.
Earlier today, my colleague, the Sen-
ator from Alaska, with other Repub-
lican colleagues, came to the floor ask-
ing a simple question—proposing a bill
to pay the men and women of the Coast
Guard, and for some reason, the minor-
ity leader and Democrats objected to
this very fair proposal.
Today, I come to the floor to offer an
amendment to the bill I introduced 10
days ago. It has been talked about in
the press. We have 24 Republican co-
sponsors of the Shutdown Fairness Act,
which does a pretty simple thing: It
simply pays those individuals who are
doing the work trying to keep this Na-
tion safe.
Mr. President, I see the minority
leader here.
I ask unanimous consent that the
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 6, H.J. Res.
1. I ask unanimous consent that the
Johnson amendment at the desk be
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be
considered read a third time and
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
an objection?
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right
to object, I heard my good friend from
Wisconsin say, give him one good rea-
son to object to the Coast Guard. No,
there is not one; there are 760,000, if
that is the right number—the number
of non-Coast Guard workers who are
not getting paid.
Similarly here, it will be easy for any
Member to get up and pick and choose
and say: Pay these. Pay those. Don’t
pay these. Don’t pay those.
Our position on this side is simple:
They should not be held hostage. They
should not say: We are not going to pay
you unless we get our way on the
wall—which is exactly what President
Trump is doing and exactly what my
colleagues, with some exceptions, have
decided to do on that side of the aisle,
including my good friend from Wis-
consin. That is not fair. Everyone de-
serves to be paid. These are all hard-
working people. They have done noth-
ing wrong. They all get up on Monday
morning, even if they have a fever or
something, to go to work because they
believe in what they are doing. They
are government workers. To pick and
choose some and not others is the
wrong way to go and would lead to a
cacophony. Every one of us could get
up and say: Maybe we should, say, just
pay the workers in Brooklyn, NY. It
doesn’t make any sense at all.
So I would modify my friend’s re-
quest and expand it to all of our Fed-
eral workers, which is only fair.
Reserving the right to object, would
the Senator modify his request to ask
unanimous consent that the Senate
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.J. Res. 28, which has been re-
ceived from the House, making further
additional continuing appropriations
through February 28; that the joint res-
olution be considered read a third time
and passed and the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
Senator from Wisconsin so modify his
request?
Mr. JOHNSON. I do object because
we basically just voted on that in the
Senate, and it was voted down. The
President would not sign that. That
would not become law. And the minor-
ity leader is holding 400-some thousand
individuals who are actually working
who should get paid—he is the one
holding them hostage.
I would yield to the Senator from
Tennessee.
Mr. SCHUMER. I object to that. I am
in the middle of an objection.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection to the modification is heard.
Mr. SCHUMER. Leader MCCONNELL
has requested I go to his office. I think
that is more important than some of
these activities. I am going to object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader does not have the
floor.
Does the Democratic leader object to
the original request?
Mr. SCHUMER. I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Wisconsin.
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I
would like to turn it over to the Sen-
ator from Tennessee for 2 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
The Senator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Could the Pre-
siding Officer let me know when 60 sec-
onds is up so the Senator from Alaska
can have 60 seconds? And then we can
go on with the colloquy people have
been waiting for.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
this is what we just heard. The Senator
from Wisconsin asked unanimous con-
sent that the Senate approve pay for
400,000 workers who are being forced to
work without pay. No Republican ob-
jects to the Senator from Wisconsin’s
idea, but the Democratic leader does.
That means the Democratic leader is
saying to 53,000 TSA employees who
make about $40,000 a year that he ob-
jects on behalf of the Democratic side
to paying them while they are forced
to work. He is saying to 54,000 Customs
and Border Protection agents that he
objects to paying them while they are
forced to work.
Senator JOHNSON says that on the
Republican side, we want to pay 42,000
Coast Guard employees who are forced
to work and aren’t getting paid. The
Democratic leader says he objects to
that and to 14,000 air traffic control-
lers, 16,000 Bureau of Prisons correc-
tions officers, and 35,000 IRS employ-
ees. They are being forced to work. The
Republicans are saying pay them; the
Democratic leader objects.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I had
previously noted on the floor the group
of Senators who want to join together
to send a clear message that we are
committed to working together to end
this shutdown and responsibly deal
with border security in a truly bipar-
tisan manner. This is a group of an
equal number of Democrats and Repub-
licans. Senator MURKOWSKI is leading
this on the Republican side of the floor
today.
I ask unanimous consent that for the
next hour, the two of us control 30 min-
utes of time; that I control 30 minutes
and Senator MURKOWSKI will control
the other 30 minutes of time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, during
this floor time, I think you are going
to see clear messages coming from
Democratic Senators and Republican
Senators that this shutdown needs to
end, that we need to pass a short-term,
3-week clean CR so we can have time to
consider the President’s request and
work together on a bipartisan border
security package.
I want my colleagues to know we
have been meeting regularly in an ef-
fort to try to see where we can find
common ground. We feel pretty con-
fident that we can find common ground
if we can get government open and get
to work in a responsible manner to
deal with border security in the best
interest of the people of this Nation.
Mr. President, I will first yield to my
friend from Virginia, Senator WARNER,
then I will yield time and give up the
floor to Senator MURKOWSKI.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate my friend, the Senator from
Maryland, yielding time. I appreciate
the fact that this may be the first
time, at least in the last few weeks,
where a group of Senators from both
sides of the aisle are actually coming
together to find agreement—not to
score ‘‘gotcha’’ points but to find
agreement. I promised the Senator I
would be very brief.
It is clear this government shutdown
needs to come to an end. My hope
would be that as we move toward that
conclusion, we will also look at the
issues revolving around, particularly,
low-paid Federal contractors who will
get no relief when the government re-
opens. I also hope we can work to-
gether.
I have legislation called the Stop
STUPIDITY Act. It is a good name. It
may need further amendments that
would try to prohibit future shutdowns
being used by either party on a going-
forward basis.
What I think we need to do, and I
think other colleagues will acknowl-
edge this, is let’s take a 3-week, short-

term CR. Let’s consider the President’s
proposal. Let me be clear. The Presi-
dent is watching. This Senator will
commit to good-faith negotiations.
This Senator will commit to sup-
porting increased border security be-
yond what we just voted on in the so-
called Democratic proposal. I hope the
President will take that kind of com-
mitment for increased border security
as a good-faith effort and will be re-
sponsive so we can get this government
reopened on a short-term basis and
that the kind of horror stories we all
can recount about our workers, con-
tractors, and oftentimes private busi-
nesses that surround those Federal in-
stallations—that will see no relief—can
actually get their operations back
open.
I thank my friend, the Senator from
Maryland, for granting me this time. I
thank the Senator from Alaska for
leadership on her time. Let’s see if this
eight can go forth and multiply so, be-
fore this weekend is over, we can get
our workforce back to work doing the
people’s business.
I yield back to the Senator from
Maryland.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I
appreciate my colleagues being down
here again on a bipartisan basis to talk
about where we are at this moment.
We just had two messaging votes.
Both of those votes failed. I voted for
both of them because my message was
I want to get this government open. I
want to do it quickly and with the
sense of urgency that responds to the
men and women who have been so sig-
nificantly impacted by this partial
government shutdown for the past 34
days. I also want to be fair to the
President’s priorities that he has ar-
ticulated in the proposal that he has
provided to us as recently as Saturday.
I think we can do this together.
My message to folks back home—my
message to people is don’t give up hope
because now is the time that we all
must come together to address these
issues, but you can’t do it when the
government is shut down.
I have indicated I am supportive of a
measure the Senator from Maryland,
Mr. CARDIN, has introduced that will
allow for a short-term CR, 3 weeks,
allow us then to go through—whether
it is the appropriations process, the Ju-
diciary Committee process—but allow
us to have this debate on these impor-
tant priorities; allow us to do the busi-
ness of the Senate, to do the business
of legislating, but let’s also allow the
business of the government to proceed
by opening up the government right
now.
We will have an opportunity to go
back and forth amongst colleagues. I
will remind folks, we have very limited
periods of time.
I am going to yield to my colleagues
on the other side. It is so important
that we are coming together now to
offer some glimmer of hope.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. I couldn’t agree more
with my friend from Alaska and the
way she worded it. We are going to
work together to open the government
as quickly as possible.
I yield to my friend from Delaware,
Senator COONS.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware.
Mr. COONS. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. I thank my colleagues from Alas-
ka, Maryland, and other States for
their willingness to spend so much
time talking, listening, and trying, to-
gether, to craft a path forward.
The role the Senate has historically
played in our constitutional order is
one where we are the body that others
look to when there is either an inflexi-
bility or an unreliability in negotiating
a path forward. We have lots of folks
across this country suffering from this
government shutdown. It is having an
impact that all of us could detail.
I have to ask, what is it going to take
for us to reopen this government? Is it
going to take a breakdown in food se-
curity or airline security? Is it going to
take an increase in crime or terrorism,
an accident, or thousands more Ameri-
cans struggling to feed their families,
losing housing or electricity? I will not
go on with the list. We all know the
human cost of this shutdown.
I am here to join my friends, my col-
leagues from both parties, in saying
that we are intent on making a good-
faith effort to reopen the government
for 3 weeks, to promptly support good-
faith negotiations, to address the
President’s priorities, to discuss what
effective, modern investment in border
security and changes in immigration
policy would look like, and then reach
a resolution in 3 weeks or less. We have
to be able to do this. We have to show
our country and the world that democ-
racy can work.
I am optimistic that with the passion
and the commitment I have heard from
my bipartisan colleagues who stand on
the floor with me tonight, that it is
possible to get this done and that
whatever gets taken up and considered
in regular order by this body could
then be passed by the House and signed
into law by the President.
Let us take a first bold step together
today and sign on to an amendment
that my colleague from Maryland has,
committing us to a clean, 3-week con-
tinuing resolution, reopening the gov-
ernment, and promptly negotiating in
good faith to increase investment in
border security.
I yield the floor.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I would ask that
the Senator from Maine be recognized
at this time.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this
shutdown, the longest in our history,
must come to an end. It has already
caused far too much harm for 800,000
dedicated Federal employees and their
families who are struggling to pay bills
without paychecks and are on the
verge of missing yet another paycheck.
It has hurt the American people who
need to interact with Federal Agencies,
including seniors, low-income families,
people with disabilities who worry
about their housing assistance. It is
damaging our economy, causing a drop
in consumer confidence and consumer
spending.
Ironically, shutdowns always end up
costing the government more money
than if we had operated as we should.
I see a glimmer of hope here. We at
least have had two votes today on two
different plans. Like the Senator from
Alaska and others, I supported both
plans because my priority is to reopen
government, but where I am really op-
timistic is the fact that 16 Senators are
on the floor, equally divided between
the two parties, and willing to com-
promise. Compromise is not a dirty
word. It is not a sign of weakness. It is
a sign of strength.
Let us compromise to reopen govern-
ment, address border security, and get
on with the business of this country.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. At this time, I yield to
my colleague from Arizona, Senator
SINEMA.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona.
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I want
to thank my colleagues from Maryland
and Alaska for bringing us together
today but also for the work our group
has been putting in for the last several
weeks to find a solution to end this
harmful and hurtful shutdown.
The voters of Arizona want a govern-
ment that is lean, that allows them to
pursue their individual interests, and
that, above all, does not detract from
their everyday life.
Unfortunately, when the Federal
Government is shut down, as it is
today, it detracts and takes away from
the quality of life for folks in Arizona.
Recently, the President asked the
Congress to consider appropriations for
border security. I stand in support of
working together across the aisle with
my colleagues in the Senate to answer
that request. Arizona needs enhanced
funding for border security, and I feel
confident that if given 3 weeks, the Re-
publicans and Democrats together in
this body could find a reasonable com-
promise that both continues to keep
our government operating in a lean and
efficient way, while also providing for
efficient and effective border security.
In Arizona, we bear the brunt of a
government that has failed its duty to
secure our border and protect our com-
munities; in Arizona, we bear the brunt
of our country’s failure to solve the im-
migration crisis we live in today; in
Arizona, we have been waiting for over
three decades for the Congress to solve
this problem so that we in Arizona can
live our lives free from unnecessary
government interference and with the
full freedom our country has promised
us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S562 January 24, 2019
I believe that if we work together
over the next 3 weeks, we can find a
compromise, we can find a solution to
this challenge, and we can work with
our colleagues in the House and send a
piece of legislation to the President
that will meet the security needs of
our country and ensure that we keep
government operating efficiently and
effectively for the people of my State
and for this country. I look forward to
working over the next several weeks to
solve this challenge.
I request of the President, allow us
those 3 weeks to find this bipartisan
solution together.
I yield back.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask that the
Senator from South Carolina be recog-
nized.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina.
Mr. GRAHAM. I just got off the
phone with the President. I told him
we were talking about a 3-week CR. All
of us believe that if we had 3 weeks
with the government open and all the
discord coming from a shutdown, that
we could find a way forward to produce
a bill that he would sign that would be
good for everybody in the country, but
we need that opportunity.
He gave me some indications of
things he would want for a 3-week CR
that would be a good-faith downpay-
ment on moving forward that I thought
were imminently reasonable. Rather
than me telling you about what he
said, I think Senator SCHUMER and
Senator MCCONNELL will be talking
about this.
The 3-week CR concept is a good
idea, and what the President wants to
add to it made sense to me, and it gets
us back in the ball game. Here is what
is going to happen. The TPS language
that was sent over by the President is
a move forward but unacceptable to my
Democratic colleagues. It needs to be
like what TIM KAINE did. The DACA
provision sent over by the President is
moving forward, but it needs to be
what Senator DURBIN did because they
are both, I think, reasonable proposals
that the President should be able to ac-
cept.
To my Democratic friends, money for
a barrier is required to get this deal
done. It will not be a concrete wall, and
the money will be a program to a DHS
plan that all of you know about and
have been briefed on and should ap-
prove.
You are not giving President Trump
a bunch of money to do anything he
wants to do. He has to spend it on a
plan that the professionals have come
up with. If you want $800 million for
refugee assistance, you will get it. We
all need more judges, and 250 more Bor-
der Patrol agents on the border would
be good for us all.
I want to let the public know I have
never been more optimistic than I am
now if we can find a way to open up the
government for 3 weeks. If we fail, ev-
erybody can say we did our best. This
is one last chance to get this right. I
am just hoping and praying that what
the President is asking for, in addition
to Senator CARDIN’s 3-week CR, he will
entertain. Let’s get to work. If we can
get in a room, we will fix this, and it
won’t take 3 weeks.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am
now pleased to yield to my colleague
from Maryland, Senator VAN HOLLEN,
who has been a real partner during his
stay here in the Senate. We have trav-
eled the State of Maryland together,
and we know firsthand the hardships of
this shutdown. We have seen the faces,
and we have seen the consequences.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
thank my friend and partner from
Maryland for all of his work in ending
the shutdown.
I thank him, as well as our friend
from Alaska, Senator MURKOWSKI, for
bringing us together in a bipartisan
way to find a solution to end this shut-
down as soon as possible. That is why I
support the bipartisan amendment that
will be filed this afternoon to open the
government for 3 weeks.
I should stress that this is not my
preferred solution. I would like to take
up the bill that is at the desk that
would open eight of the nine Federal
Departments right away and give us
time to deal with the Department of
Homeland Security. Yet the proposal
before us is our best option at this
point in time for resolving this shut-
down.
What will 3 weeks accomplish? It is a
fair question.
First of all, it will allow Federal Gov-
ernment employees—all of them—to
get back to work for the American peo-
ple and help resume vital services.
No. 2, it will make sure that all of
them get paid—those who are working
without pay and those who have been
locked out. That is important because
all of us know that tomorrow marks
the second full pay period of when they
will get big fat zeros on their pay-
checks even as their bills keep coming
through the door.
It will do something else that is very
important. It will give the Senate and
the House a little breathing room to
work together on a bipartisan basis to
address a number of priorities—prior-
ities to make sure we provide adequate
border security, which can include ad-
ditional resources. We can spend some
time addressing immigration issues,
including those that were just men-
tioned by the Senator from South
Carolina.
I believe this time and space is abso-
lutely needed to allow us to work to-
gether in a bipartisan way. While 3
weeks may not sound like a lot of time,
in part, it will help focus our attention
on getting the job done, and we will all
be held accountable in the House, in
the Senate, and in the White House for
getting our work done in that period.
I thank our colleagues for showing
this good faith in trying to find a solu-
tion to doing it. Take 3 weeks. Open
the government. Let’s have those very
important discussions. Let’s do it in a
sober and serious way. If we do so, I am
confident that we can find a permanent
result that will help us get out of this
crisis.
I thank the Senator.
I yield back my time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I
yield to the Senator from Georgia.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia.
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, all
Democrats and Republicans, pay close
attention.
I have been here for 20 years, and I
have seen a lot of shutdowns—about
five of them. I want to talk about what
they have produced.
The first one with Bill Clinton pro-
duced Monica Lewinsky. That is how
they got into all the trouble—because
she was an intern at the White House.
Idle hands are never good.
For us, Newt Gingrich lost his job in
the same shutdown. He lost his job be-
cause he lost six votes in the House and
couldn’t get reelected as Speaker. I had
to replace him. I am kind of glad that
happened, but it is still not a good rea-
son to have a shutdown.
A few years later, great Senators—
John McCain being one of them and
Ted Kennedy being another—worked
their fingers to the bone and came up
with a great immigration bill that I
was a part of in my first term in the
Senate. We got castigated and ruined
because, all of a sudden, ‘‘amnesty’’ be-
came a four-letter word, and political
consultants found it to be kind of an
easy way to run against people in the
party.
For 15 years, we have been beating
each other over something that ought
to be easy to do, which is to change for
the better. A lot of people think
Congress’s job is for us to come to
Washington and change things for the
better. When it comes to immigration,
all we ever change is the subject. We
never end the debate, and we never
pass a result. Oftentimes, we call each
other names for the wrong reason.
I am here for one reason—to thank
my colleagues who are on the floor. To
all of the others who are ready to do
some business, I am ready to do some
business. It is time we put the workers
in our government back to work. It is
time we did what we promised the peo-
ple in the United States of America we
would do. And it is time we went to
work because when everybody is out of
work, it is our fault. They are the peo-
ple who carry the mail, who empty the
garbage, who cook in the cafeteria,
who clean up the parks, and they do ev-
erything without complaining whatso-
ever. They are out there—many of
them—not even being paid right now
while we are sitting here, debating a
subject that we can’t reach a solution
on—period.
We need to take our armor off, leave
our weapons at the door, walk in the
room, and shake hands.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S563
January 24, 2019
We need to grab BEN CARDIN’s hand
and say: BEN, thank you for making an
effort as a Democrat.
LISA, thank you, as a Republican, for
supporting it.
Let’s sit down, and let’s pass a bill we
can all agree on that gets Americans
back to work and restores the spirit of
Ellis Island and the pride of the United
States of America.
I yield back.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have
joined Senator ISAKSON on many bills
since I have been in the Senate, and I
look forward to working with him to
find the solution with regard to border
security issues. I thank him for his
comments.
I yield to my colleague from Maine,
Senator KING, who has been so instru-
mental in trying to come up with con-
crete ways to end this shutdown.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Mr. KING. Mr. President, it strikes
me that there are really two problems
before us—one we can resolve this
evening or tomorrow morning or in the
next 24 hours, and that is the shut-
down. At least we could resolve it for a
limited period of time and then start
talking about the second problem,
which is border security.
I think one of the unfortunate reali-
ties of what has happened in the last
month is the assumption on the part of
some that there was no good faith on
border security and no interest in deal-
ing with border security from this side
of the aisle. That is a misunder-
standing. I voted in 2013 for the largest
border security provision that I think
has ever come before the U.S. Senate.
So did virtually every Member of this
caucus and a third or more of the other
caucus. Two-thirds of the Senate voted
for that bill with a very important bor-
der security provision.
I want to be very clear. I am very
supportive of border security and of in-
creasing border security. There also
may be cases in which there may be
parts of the border at which some kind
of barrier makes sense and is cost-ef-
fective; whereas, there are other areas
of the border at which it doesn’t make
sense. What I am interested in is a
thorough discussion with the experts
about what the most cost-effective way
is to protect our citizens and secure
the border. I believe this proposal
today gives us the breathing space to
have that discussion.
I remind my colleagues that this ad-
ministration submitted a border secu-
rity proposal to the Congress last Feb-
ruary with its budget of $1.6 billion. Lo
and behold, it was approved by the Ap-
propriations Committee and by this
body. That is an indication to me that
there is good faith.
I think the important thing to com-
municate now is to not complicate this
with conditions. Let’s take the awful
hammer away—and I don’t have to re-
iterate all that has been said today
about the devastating effect of this
shutdown on people in all of our States
and on people who are working for no
pay, which is fundamentally wrong—
and then spend the next 3 weeks find-
ing a solution, which I believe we can
do. I have had enough discussions with
my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle. I think there is a solution to be
had that will satisfy the President, the
two bodies of Congress, and, most im-
portantly, the American people in
terms of the protection we can provide.
I am happy to join my colleague
today in supporting this message and,
importantly, to join my colleagues
across the aisle. Give us breathing
space. Take the problem of the shut-
down away. Then we can have a discus-
sion and a debate and find a solution
through a process, which is the way it
ought to be, not with a shutdown hang-
ing over everyone. That is not the way
we should be governing.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues on finding a creative, cost-
effective, and safe solution to this issue
of border security to protect this coun-
try.
I thank the Presiding Officer.
I yield the floor.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President,
how much time remains on the Repub-
lican side?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publicans have 21 minutes remaining.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Pre-
siding Officer.
I now yield to the Senator from Ohio.
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I
thank my colleague from Alaska for
her leadership today; my colleague
from Maine, who just spoke; my col-
league from Maryland; and all of my
colleagues on the floor.
By the way, there are several Repub-
licans who came up to me over the last
hour and asked: May I speak in this
colloquy? We didn’t have time for all of
them, but that is a good sign. It shows
that there are a lot of Members—16
here on the floor and many others—
who believe it is time for us to figure
this out.
No one likes a government shutdown.
I have put out a bill five times now to
the Congress to end government shut-
downs. By the way, it is getting a few
more cosponsors now, and it should be-
cause this situation doesn’t make
sense. It doesn’t make sense for the
families who are affected, including
those who are going to work without
pay and are living paycheck to pay-
check. This is true hardship. It doesn’t
make sense for the taxpayers, who
never end up winning in these govern-
ment shutdowns but whom we end up
paying after the fact—often, for gov-
ernment services that were never pro-
vided—because that is how shutdowns
work. Finally, it is bad for the econ-
omy. If we go another few weeks, there
will be one point off our GDP, which
will be a huge deal for wages and jobs
and economic growth. So let’s get this
thing behind us.
There is a serious issue here, which
is, How do we secure the border? Our
southern border is a mess. I call it a
‘‘crisis’’ while others call it something
else, but we have to address this. The
President is right about that.
I am hopeful today, and I am hopeful
for three reasons.
One is that we just went through a
process whereby there was failure on
both sides. As was expected, we had
two proposals out there, but nobody ex-
pected they would pass. It was an op-
portunity, I guess, for voices to be
heard, but no one expected them to
pass. After this, the pieces are starting
to be put back together by this group
and others.
I just listened to my colleagues on
the other side. I listened to what Sen-
ator KING said. They want border secu-
rity. They want to enhance what is
going on at the border now. Senator
KING just talked about the need for
more barriers. I mean, look, if you are
serious about this, you have to ac-
knowledge that twice as many people
crossed in the last 2 months, which we
have records for, than a year ago.
There has been about a 50-percent in-
crease in families crossing and about a
25-percent increase in kids crossing.
There has been a 3,000-percent increase
in the last 5 years in people coming for-
ward and claiming asylum. This is a
problem we have to address.
There is a huge problem with regard
to drugs. I come from Ohio, where we
are getting hit hard by the heroin and
crystal meth that are coming across
the border from Mexico. We are not
stopping it—we are stopping very little
of it—which is why Democrats and Re-
publicans alike have said there should
be more screening at our ports of
entry. I agree.
So I appreciate what my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle have said.
I will let them speak for themselves in
our going forward, but they want bor-
der security too. I am encouraged by
the fact that they were talking about
it today in terms of coming up with a
solution here to enhance security.
Secondly, I like the fact that the
President put out a proposal. I think
he should have put out a proposal that
was a compromise, and he did. He said:
OK, we are not just going to have more
border security; we are going to deal
with about a million people who are in
temporary protected status who have
come from these 10 countries. We don’t
want to send them back because there
is a war or there is strife or there is a
natural disaster. There are about
400,000 people.
We are also going to take care of the
people who have come here as children,
through no fault of their own, who now
find themselves in this uncertain sta-
tus. These are the so-called DACA re-
cipients. I think it is time for Congress
to act on this.
Again, the President put forward a
plan that said: OK, you guys help me
on border security. I am also going to
deal with these other issues that many
Democrats have talked about for years.
That makes me hopeful in that fi-
nally we are talking about these issues.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S564 January 24, 2019
I agree with what LINDSEY GRAHAM
said in that we can do more on these
two and that we can do more on some
issues that the Democrats care about. I
believe the administration is willing to
do that, but, gosh, at least we are fi-
nally talking.
Finally, I am encouraged by the fact
that we are not that far apart. Let me
be specific. I think the administration
and the Democrats have
mischaracterized the President’s plan
as it relates to barriers on the southern
border. It may surprise you to learn
that in the President’s proposal he has
just given us, it is not 2,000 miles of the
border. He is talking about his interest
in 234 more miles. There will be no wall
in the sense of a cement wall, a con-
crete wall. He has said there will be
fences; there will be vehicle barriers,
low barriers; and there will be pedes-
trian wire fences. Yet it won’t be done
by what the White House says is the
right thing to do; it will be done by ex-
perts. The experts are in the ‘‘Border
Security Improvement Plan’’ that we
embraced in this Congress in the last
appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018—
that we are working on now, which is
what the CR is—and in the new one
that was passed last summer. We said
this plan is the right plan because it
says what kinds of barriers are going
to be where.
People ask, how did the President
come up with $5.7 billion? Do you know
how he came up with it? It was from
wanting to fund the top 10 priorities of
the ‘‘Border Security Improvement
Plan’’ that was put out by the experts.
That is what that is. We can disagree
on whether that is too much money,
too little money, or whatever, but it is
only 234 miles out of 2,000 miles. Al-
most all of it is in Texas, in places
where there are no fencing, as opposed
to California or Arizona, where there is
a lot of fencing, or even New Mexico.
We can say: Well, maybe that is too
much. Maybe we will go a little more
slowly. But this is a plan about which
we had all—Republicans and Demo-
crats—with a huge vote out of the Ap-
propriations Committee, said: This is a
plan that we ought to follow.
I don’t think we are that far apart.
Frankly, I think both sides need to
start characterizing the plan accu-
rately and stop talking past each
other. I think if we do that, with rea-
sonable numbers on both sides of the
aisle here, we can do something that
makes sense, yes, to help secure our
southern border, which everybody
wants to do, and to do it in a smart
way and not waste money.
Walls are not the only answer.
Fences are not the only answer. You
have to have more sensors and more
cameras. You have to have more immi-
gration judges, which Democrats want
and so does the President in his pro-
posal. You have to have more screening
for these drugs coming in. You have to
help in terms of the human trafficking.
These are things that both parties
want to do.
So I am optimistic, although frus-
trated—really frustrated—by this shut-
down, but I am more optimistic today
because I hear on the other side of the
aisle a willingness to come forward. I
sense with the new proposal that there
is a willingness to reach out, and,
folks, it is time.
Let’s stop this shutdown. Shutdowns
are stupid. Let’s protect that southern
border, and let’s move forward on other
priorities we have in this Congress.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I cer-
tainly appreciate the words from Sen-
ator PORTMAN. The two of us have been
working together since we were in the
House of Representatives, and we are
proud that we have a record of concrete
accomplishments, working together
across party lines. Sometimes we had
to take on the leadership of both of our
parties, but we got things done. So I
am encouraged by his comments, and I
really do believe we can work together
to resolve this issue.
With that, I would like to yield to
my colleague from West Virginia, Sen-
ator MANCHIN, who has been a real
leader on the practical impact that
this shutdown has. The story about
what is happening in the prisons lo-
cated in West Virginia I think really
frighten all of us.
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I want
to thank Senator CARDIN, Senator
MURKOWSKI, Senator COLLINS, and all
of my colleagues here.
This is a good step. We are all here
for the first time after 30 days. But
guess what. You have been back home
talking to the people who are hurting.
They have no idea why we are doing
what we are doing, allowing them to be
harmed the way they are.
I voted for both proposals today. I
will vote for whatever it takes to get
us back in the room to make some-
thing happen—to open up the govern-
ment.
I understand that the CR works this
way. If we have a CR, then, proportion-
ately, there is going to be 3 weeks of
money still being used for DHS and for
border security. I understand that is
how it works. It is based on $1.3 billion
of last year’s approps. A CR continues
the spending from last year. So there
will be money there to continue on in
good faith.
I don’t think any of us would want to
come back 3 weeks from now and say:
It is your fault for shutting it down.
No, it is the President’s fault.
No, it is our fault.
No one wants to go through that. I
don’t know why the 3 weeks is unrea-
sonable for anybody if it is presented
properly to the President that you are
going to have continuation of money,
proportionately, for the 3 weeks that
we are going to be in that CR.
The thing that I can’t understand is
that I am hearing that the President
wants $5.7 billion. Senator PORTMAN
just told us where that came from—
from the people who are experts and
should know, the Customs and Border
Patrol people. I am understanding
also—and I heard this morning—that
some of the leadership from the Demo-
crats on the House side are saying that
they would consider $5.7 billion for
anything but a wall. That means they
know we need border security, but they
have a different idea of how to secure
the border.
Well, guess what. If you want to
spend $5.7 billion for border security
and the President wants to spend $5.7
billion for border security, then, sure-
ly, we can sit down in that 3-week pe-
riod and, talking to the professionals,
figure out what needs to be done and
where our greatest risks are. How do
we stop the opioids and all of the drugs
that are coming in? It has ravaged my
State. It is horrible what my State is
going through.
On top of that, I have about 12,000
people who are working for the Federal
Government. I have never seen more
people impacted. All they are saying is
this: You people really don’t care be-
cause none of you are hurting. You
talk a good game. You throw a lot of
words back and forth, but no one is
hurting. We are the ones who are hurt-
ing.
Then, I have essentials working in
prisons. Basically, most of our prisons
are in very rural areas. The average
drive time to our prison is 1 hour. The
prison I am talking about is Hazelton.
It is a 1-hour drive time. People are
making decisions. They are not not
going to work because they are upset
and mad. They know their responsi-
bility, but here is the other responsi-
bility: They have to make a decision
because they have no cash. They say:
Of what little bit of money I have in re-
sources, do I put gas in the tank or do
I put food on the table for the kids? It
is one of the two because we don’t
know how long this is going to take.
Now we are trying to decide whether
we are basically going to carpool or
take what public transportation we can
get.
Guess what. Public transportation is
starting to shut down too. The buses
are starting to shut down. It is the way
they can get to work in masses.
Colleagues, let me tell you that I
have been in public service, like all of
you, and I think we are all in it for the
right reason. We wanted to truly serve
the public, but we are not serving the
public. We are all guilty, every one of
us. I don’t care how you vote on bills.
I don’t care what we talk about. We are
all getting painted with the same brush
right now. No one is going to escape
this. It is absolutely horrific what is
being done.
I have always said this: Government
should be your partner and your ally,
not your adversary. Right now, the
government is the enemy of the people
who basically are providing the serv-
ices that people depend on and who are
protecting us. This is why this has to
stop.
I am saying to the President: Mr.
President, please, give us the 3 weeks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S565
January 24, 2019
We understand we need border secu-
rity.
Basically, our colleagues on the
other side understand there should be
compassion. When you have a child
who was brought here at 2 days old, 2
weeks old, or 2 months and now is an
adult and has no idea how they got
here but they would like to enjoy the
fruits and be able to give something
back to this country, there ought to be
a pathway forward. These are the
things that we all seem to agree on at
certain times.
Along with many of the Senators who
were here in 2013, I voted for one of the
biggest packages we have ever had—$44
billion in security; basically, border se-
curity—and not one person could get a
pathway to citizenship or become a cit-
izen of this great country if they were
not here for the right reason. They
might have gotten here the wrong way,
but they came for the right reason.
Should they not have an opportunity?
They could not become a citizen after
10 or 13 years until we secured the bor-
der. That is what this was all about.
Now we are fighting over whatever. I
don’t know. I can’t even explain it
when I go back home. So I tell them:
Listen, I am for border security. I will
vote for border security. I will vote
compassionately to try to help people
to find a pathway to be an American
citizen also, especially children.
The other thing is that I think we
can find a pathway forward if the
President will give us the 3 weeks. I
guarantee you that I don’t think any of
us will vote for another shutdown or
let this happen.
We can’t let this go another day
longer. We cannot leave here until we
fix this. The people back home say: I
will tell you the only way you are
going to fix it is when you are hurting
as bad as I am hurting. Why don’t you
all stop your pay? Why are you still
getting a paycheck? Oh, yes, you fixed
that because that is a constitutional
amendment. You are taken care of, and
it is out of your hands. You can’t deny
your pay. It is going to come.
They say: I will tell you that this
will never happen again if, basically,
the day that the shutdown begins, for
every Congressperson—every Senator
and every Representative, all 535—and
the President and everybody who
works in that White House over there
who is making policy—the pay stops. I
guarantee you one thing: You will
work around the clock. You will work
around the clock to prevent another
shutdown.
I cannot disagree with them. So I am
saying: I am all in. I am all in. I will do
whatever it takes. I will stay here 24/7.
I will do whatever it takes to bring
people back together, but, most impor-
tantly, to get people back to work. We
can do that and still have border secu-
rity and have some compassion for the
people who are hurting the most.
Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President,
that is exactly why we are here—to get
this government open, to get people
paid, and to get people back to work.
Let me turn to the Senator from
Louisiana.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana.
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, If I
were sitting at home or in the Gallery
right now, I would be incredibly frus-
trated. I am frustrated, but if I were
home, I would be particularly frus-
trated. Why?
Think about what we have agreed
upon in this colloquy from both the
Democratic and Republican side of the
aisle. We agree that border security is
important. We agree that it is one of
the primary functions of the Federal
Government. We agree that there needs
to be more money, and although in leg-
islation we have not agreed, we cer-
tainly have statements from Demo-
crats and, of course, as well as Repub-
licans, that barriers are also impor-
tant.
COLLIN PETERSON, a Democrat on the
House side, put it well. On January 22,
2019, he said:
Give Trump the money. I’d give him the
whole thing . . . and put strings on it so you
make sure he puts the wall where it needs to
be. Why are we fighting over this? We’re
going to build that wall anyway, at some
time.
My Democratic Senate colleagues
have said something along the same
line, maybe not as point-blank but
they certainly have said it. We agree
there. We agree that the American
worker who continues to show up but is
not getting paid needs to get paid.
As for those TSA agents and those
air traffic controllers whom we use as
we go back and forth to our districts,
God bless them. More than 51,000 TSA
agents are working without pay. There
are 10,000 air traffic controller support
staff who remain furloughed.
By the way, I and others have intro-
duced legislation to pay those while
they are working. I think it is some-
thing we, the Senate, should take up.
We need a solution that fulfills our na-
tional security responsibilities, ends
the shutdown, and so that these work-
ers can get paid.
I say it is time to move forward, ne-
gotiate, and come to the table, but you
may ask: If Democratic and Republican
Senators all agree to this, then, why is
it not happening?
In fairness to President Trump,
whose rhetoric sometimes inflames and
sometimes pushes off and, as my col-
league from Ohio said, who sometimes
describes things in a way that mis-
represents his actual intent, it is not a
wall from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pa-
cific Ocean. It is a wall in certain
places that are high flow with pedes-
trian traffic. But, nonetheless, clearly,
we have come to a point where a per-
sonality conflict between the President
and the Speaker has put them at log-
gerheads and, apparently, they are un-
able to negotiate.
It is clear from our colloquy that
Senators on both sides of the aisle
would like to come to a solution that
secures the southern border, opens the
government, and pays the workers.
In fairness to the President, he has
put forward an opening offer. He has
said he wants that money for the bar-
rier, but he has put other issues on the
table that are near and dear to Demo-
crats’ hearts that, hopefully, would
open the way to a compromise.
The way I can imagine it would work
is that the Speaker would put forward
a counterproposal. I think that is
where we need to be, to rise above any
personal dislike or any entrenched po-
sitions that people have come to but,
rather, to come to a point where we
recognize that the American people are
better served if the folks serving them
are getting paid, that it is important
to secure our southern border, and that
some sort of barrier will be part of
that, as Members of both parties have
agreed to.
So it is time to move forward. It is
time to negotiate. It is time for the
two principals to come to some sort of
compromise. Clearly, we in the Senate
are willing to move forward.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am
pleased to yield to my colleague from
New Hampshire, Ms. HASSAN.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire.
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I join
with my colleagues here in saying how
disappointed I was that today’s vote to
reopen the government immediately
while we keep negotiating to address
border security was defeated, but I am
encouraged by the bipartisan group on
the Senate floor with me this after-
noon to send one clear message: Let’s
pass a clean, 3-week continuing resolu-
tion to reopen the government imme-
diately, and each of us is committed to
work to pass a strong, bipartisan bor-
der security bill during that 3-week pe-
riod.
Like many of my colleagues, I have
gone down to the border. I have talked
to our frontline personnel on the bor-
der. There is a lot of common ground
about what we need to strengthen our
border security. I join my colleagues
here and thank Senators CARDIN and
MURKOWSKI for organizing us in saying
that we can get to a solution on border
security, but we need to open the gov-
ernment right away.
There is no reason to keep the gov-
ernment closed while negotiations on
strengthening border security con-
tinue. In fact, there is concern that ne-
gotiations forced by shutdowns set a
dangerous precedent.
So I strongly urge my colleagues
from both parties to support this bipar-
tisan approach. I also thank Senators
GRAHAM and CARDIN for their leader-
ship in this effort, and I am committed
to working with them and the rest of
this bipartisan group to find a way for-
ward.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S566 January 24, 2019
Every day that this senseless shut-
down continues, it is hurting people in
New Hampshire and across the coun-
try. We have all been sharing stories.
We have heard these stories. We have
talked to the hard-working men and
women who serve the people of this
country and who are doing their work
without pay or who are furloughed and
who really don’t know how they are
going to make their next mortgage
payment and their next utility pay-
ment or put food on the table and get
their medication—all of the things
they need a good day’s wages to do. So
we need to end this now.
I join with my colleagues in being
here this afternoon to simply say that
we need to open the government and
that I am committed, as all of us are,
to negotiate in good faith going for-
ward to find a solution on border secu-
rity.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I
turn to my colleague from Iowa.
Ms. ERNST. I thank Senator MUR-
KOWSKI and Senator CARDIN for their
leadership today in organizing this
floor colloquy, and I thank the Pre-
siding Officer.
I want to join my colleagues in ex-
pressing how urgent it is that we not
only secure our borders but that we
open our government. We really do
have to come together. We have two
sides of the aisle here, our Democrat
and Republican friends. Certainly we
can come to a solution. We have to fig-
ure out a path forward, folks, and I am
glad we are here to do that.
We have a duty to provide for our Na-
tion’s security, and it is also our job to
fund the government. We just voted on
a sensible and smart proposal offered
by the President that every Democrat
and Republican should have supported,
but, unfortunately, it was rejected
today.
Back home, hard-working Iowans
and, of course, Americans all across
the country are tired of government
shutdowns, and they are disappointed
in the dysfunction of Washington, DC.
The impacts of this government shut-
down are tangible for families. They
feel it. People are hurting all across
this Nation.
Most families don’t have a rainy day
fund. Money lasts only so long when
you have zero income. Prolonged peri-
ods without a paycheck are
unsustainable.
I have a friend who works for Federal
law enforcement. Fortunately, he is up
in seniority, but he told me the other
day: JONI, our young Federal workers—
they just can’t make ends meet.
Children don’t stop growing; people
don’t stop getting sick; and the obliga-
tions of caring for families don’t stop
just because we have. Washington has
stopped working, folks. We have to get
it together.
I have heard from businesses on the
brink of collapse. I have heard from
first-time home buyers who are trapped
in limbo right now, and there are seri-
ous consequences that I have heard
about from our farmers who work
every day with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, the USDA. Our food
banks, churches, and other charities,
which spend their time and resources
helping families and communities
through these tough times, helping fur-
loughed workers and those who are in
need, are running out of resources.
They are running out of time. It can
last only so long.
We need our DOJ working to stop
crime and violence. We need our vital
government Agencies back up and run-
ning. We can do that. I support a
stronger border, and I support the
President’s sensible proposal, which
does include a barrier, manpower, ports
of entry, technology, and infrastruc-
ture. I think it is necessary that these
investments be part of an overall deal.
Our lack of border security has re-
sulted in a humanitarian crisis at the
border. We have tens of thousands of il-
legal and inadmissible immigrants on
our southern border every month.
I agree with President Trump and
many of my colleagues that securing
our southern border is a must-do to
discourage illegal immigration, curb
human trafficking, stop drugs, stop
gun trafficking, in addition to stopping
the ability of gangs and terrorists to
exploit the holes in our system.
The American people expect us to do
better. We have an opportunity to step
up and do the right thing, and that is
to find a solution. We have to do it by
working together.
I again thank all of my colleagues for
coming together today on the floor.
Senator CARDIN, Senator MURKOWSKI,
thank you for organizing the effort.
Hopefully, we will come to a solution.
Folks, the Nation is watching us. We
can do better.
I yield the floor.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Sen-
ator from Iowa.
I have a question for the Presiding
Officer in terms of how much time re-
mains on the Republican side.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six min-
utes.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Perfect. We are
down to the remaining two speakers, 3
minutes each. I ask that Senator
GARDNER be recognized at this time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado.
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I
thank the Senator from Alaska for this
opportunity to come to the floor to
talk about what this Chamber needs to
do, along with the House and the Presi-
dent, to get this government reopened
and to fund border security, something
that all Americans agree on—that we
can walk and chew gum at the same
time; that we can multitask; that we
can find a way to fund priority spend-
ing on the border; and that we can find
a way to fund 800,000 government em-
ployees, including 53,000 Federal em-
ployees in my home State of Colorado.
In 2014, I was elected to the Senate.
In November of 2014, we were dealing
with a question of whether the govern-
ment would shut down. In fact, the
first issue we were asked in the new
Congress as we headed back into ses-
sion was this: Would there be a loom-
ing shutdown over immigration? That
was not in 2018 or 2019. That was actu-
ally in 2014. Here is what I said then:
There’s no time, place, or purpose of a gov-
ernment shutdown or default. That’s simply
ridiculous and something that a mature gov-
erning body doesn’t even contemplate. We
ought to make it very clear that that’s sim-
ply not acceptable.
I said that in 2014; I echoed it in De-
cember 2018; and I stand on the floor
today sharing the same belief, senti-
ment, and value.
We need border security in this coun-
try. We need to have barriers and
structures on the border where it
makes sense, as the President has said.
He has made a reasonable request to
put in place border security.
We also have a responsibility to the
people of this country to govern re-
sponsibly. That means not jeopardizing
our economy, not jeopardizing the fire-
fighters in Colorado who can’t go to
training right now because the govern-
ment is shut down.
My home State lost hundreds of
homes last year due to wildfires. Think
about the catastrophes in California
and across the West last year. Fire-
fighters from around the country were
called to do heroic things and save en-
tire towns, yet those training services,
classes, and tools they need for a fire
season that could start at any time are
being denied—training and classes that
they need to save their own lives, to
save other lives, and to protect our
land.
We have farmers who are trying to
get production loans right now. They
can’t get their production loans
through certain offices because of the
shutdown. Farming is not good right
now, and prices are so low right now
that people are struggling. I talked to
a farmer in Colorado yesterday. He
doesn’t know what the bank is going to
say to him on Friday, tomorrow, when
he goes in, and he can’t get ahold of
anybody at the USDA because of the
shutdown.
We need border security. That is why
I voted for both measures today—the
$5.7 billion for border security and the
continuing resolution proposal that
contains the President’s 2018 border se-
curity proposal. Both measures in-
cluded border security.
We can do this. It is not that dif-
ficult. It shouldn’t be a challenge to
govern responsibly. Shutdowns aren’t
the solution. Walking and chewing gum
at the same time shouldn’t be so dif-
ficult, and I hope this Chamber will
come to its senses, along with our
House colleagues and the White House,
to move forward.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I
now ask that the Senator from Arizona
be recognized.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S567
January 24, 2019
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona.
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, I
thank the Senator from Alaska for or-
ganizing this—both sides of the aisle—
so we can begin to have our voices
heard for those we represent here on
the Senate floor.
I came yesterday from Yuma, AZ,
and the day before I was in Nogales,
AZ. I visited Nogales’s port of entry
and the CBP officers coming to work
every single day now without pay. On
Monday, they processed 2,000 trucks
through the port of entry there. That
cross-border commerce is so important
for an economy like Arizona’s and for
jobs.
They also seized 18 kilograms of
methamphetamine, heroin, and
fentanyl, which are contributing to the
opioid crisis and the drug crisis in our
country.
Morale is still pretty good because
they still know how important it is for
them to be there on the watch and do
their job. However, it is unacceptable
that they are being asked to come to
work and not being paid. As was said
by other colleagues, some of the lower
level officers—the younger individuals
early on the job—have no reserves. I
talked to several of them. They are
very concerned about what is going to
happen when they miss a second pay-
check here in the next day.
When I went to Yuma and talked to
the Border Patrol, it was the same
thing. They need to be on the job. They
want to be on the job. They know how
important it is for our country and for
border security.
I visited the place where, just last
week, 376 people were able to tunnel
under where we have a barrier they
can’t see through. They weren’t able to
see it until they had actually breached
it, and they caught a couple of MS–13
gang members yesterday.
Again, they are asking: Please, let’s
secure our border. Let’s provide the re-
sources for the agents and for the offi-
cers and for what they need to do every
single day, and let’s open up the gov-
ernment.
We can do these things. This is why
America is so frustrated with Wash-
ington, DC, and why many of us ran to
come here in the first place: What is
the matter with you guys? Just get it
together; get something through the
House and the Senate that can be
signed by the President to open up the
government and secure our border.
Let’s roll up our sleeves, let’s stay
here all night around the clock, and
let’s get this mission done.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, over the
last hour, many of our colleagues have
come to the floor—Democrats and Re-
publicans—with different views about
how we should deal with border secu-
rity issues and how we should deal with
the problems at hand but with a com-
mon willingness and commitment to
reach a bipartisan agreement.
In order for that to be accomplished,
we need time. Therefore, we are filing
this afternoon a bipartisan amendment
to the underlying bill that would pro-
vide 3 weeks for a continuing resolu-
tion for government to be opened so
that we can work together to deal with
the border security issues.
I agree with Senator KING in his opti-
mism that we will be able to reach an
agreement. It is interesting that Sen-
ator KING is an Independent. This
should not be a partisan problem on
border security. We should be able to
resolve the issues.
I thank Senator MURKOWSKI for her
help in organizing this event. We tried
to work in a truly bipartisan manner
in order to give optimism, and I think,
rightfully so, that we can solve this
issue if we have the time to do it.
I urge all of our colleagues to join us
in this effort. Let’s open government,
let’s have 3 weeks, and let’s all be com-
mitted to deal with border security in
the manner in which this institution in
the past has been able to deal with
tough issues.
I again thank my colleague from
Alaska, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I
thank my colleague from Maryland and
all Senators—on the Republican side
and the Democratic side—who came to
the floor after these two votes to ex-
press this air of optimism that we can
figure this out.
One of the things I have heard very
clearly from both sides is enough al-
ready—enough already. That is what
the American people are saying about
this shutdown: Enough already—figure
it out.
Well, we got the message. We know
what the mission is, and I think what
you have seen expressed here on the
floor is the good will and the good faith
that will be extended in these hours
and days going forward, knowing that
there is an urgency to get the govern-
ment open and to address the legiti-
mate priorities that the President has
outlined.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the
quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RUSSIAN HYBRID WARFARE
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I
rise to continue my series of speeches
on Russian hybrid warfare.
I have done a series of speeches on
the Russian hybrid warfare threat. It
poses a great challenge to our national
security. Russian hybrid warfare oc-
curs below the level of direct military
conflict, yet it is no less a threat to the
national security and integrity of our
democracy and society.
One tactic that Russia deploys as
part of their hybrid warfare arsenal,
and the one I would like to focus on
today, is information warfare.
Russian information warfare includes
the deployment of false or misleading
narratives against the targeted civilian
population or government, often
through deceptive means, in order to
intensify social tensions, undermine
trust in government institutions, and
sow fear and confusion, which advances
their strategic objectives.
The Defense Intelligence Agency
highlights in their Russia military
power report in 2017: ‘‘The
weaponization of information is a key
aspect of Russia’s strategy . . . Moscow
views information and psychological
warfare as a measure to neutralize ad-
versary actions in peace and to prevent
escalation to crisis or war.’’
Russia developed its playbook over
time, enhancing both the technical and
psychological aspects of these informa-
tion operations in capability, sophis-
tication, and boldness. Lessons learned
from previous information warfare
campaigns culminated in the attacks
the Kremlin unleashed against the
United States during the 2016 Presi-
dential election.
The 2016 information warfare cam-
paign, according to our intelligence
community, ‘‘demonstrated a signifi-
cant escalation in directness, level of
activity, and scope of effort compared
to previous operations.’’
Let’s be clear. Russian interference
in the 2016 election was an attack on
the Nation. It was just not a type of at-
tack that has been commonly recog-
nized as warfare. As former Director of
National Intelligence Jim Clapper stat-
ed recently, ‘‘[I]t’s hard to convey to
people how massive an assault this
was.’’
While Russian hybrid attacks were
detected by our intelligence commu-
nity and our National Security Agen-
cies in a runup to the 2016 election, the
seriousness of the threat was not ab-
sorbed across the government, includ-
ing Congress. There are a variety of
reasons for this, including political pa-
ralysis and a collective unwillingness
to believe that these attacks could
compromise our political and social in-
stitutions.
Two years on, we still have only
scratched the surface in our under-
standing of about the nature of Russian
information warfare attacks. Gaps in
our knowledge include the extent to
which these attacks have been per-
petrated at Putin’s direction, by Rus-
sian military intelligence units, known
as the GRU, and through Kremlin-
linked troll organizations. Yet we have
no time to waste. Information warfare
attacks continue against us, our allies,
and our partners to this day, and they
continue to pose a threat to our na-
tional security.
Former CIA Acting Director and Dep-
uty Director Mike Morell characterized
the attacks of the Russians against our
elections as ‘‘the political equivalent
of 9–11.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S568 January 24, 2019
In the aftermath of the tragic Sep-
tember 11 attacks of 2001, we estab-
lished a nonpartisan commission to un-
derstand what happened and why. One
of the 9/11 Commission’s conclusions
was that the U.S. Government showed
a failure of imagination by not antici-
pating and preventing the 2001 attacks
by the terrorists.
We have had no similar wholesale
reckoning in the aftermath of the at-
tacks from 2016. Some elements of our
government and society have taken
steps to focus attention on this press-
ing problem. However, these efforts
have not been sufficiently comprehen-
sive, and the nature of the threats has
not been fully communicated to the
American public.
As senior vice president for the Cen-
ter of European Analysis, Edward
Lucas assessed in a recent New York
Times documentary on Russian
disinformation, we ‘‘are still playing
catch up from a long way behind. We
are looking in the rear view mirror,
getting less bad at working out what
Russia just did to us. We are still not
looking through the windshield to find
out what’s happening now and what’s
going to be happening next.’’
We must recover from our collective
failure of imagination. We must
rethink and refocus our strategy for
countering these threats and imple-
ment necessary institutional policy
and societal changes to support that
strategy. Importantly, we must de-
velop a playbook of our own to fight
back.
While the West has been slow to rec-
ognize the extent of the threat, these
types of attacks are not new. Histori-
cally, informational warfare has long
been a part of the Soviet and Russian
arsenal.
As security scholar Keir Giles noted
in ‘‘The Handbook of Russian Informa-
tion Warfare,’’ ‘‘For all their innova-
tive use of social media and the inter-
net, current Russian methods have
deep roots in long-standing Soviet
practice.’’
During Soviet times, information
warfare tactics were part of a broader
collection of operations that were re-
ferred to as active measures.
The State Department described ac-
tive measures in a 1981 report as in-
cluding ‘‘control of the press in foreign
countries; outright and partial forgery
of documents; use of rumors, insinu-
ation, altered facts and lies; use of
international and local front organiza-
tions; clandestine operation of radio
stations; and exploitation of a nation’s
academic, political, and media figures
as collaborators to influence policies of
the nation.’’
Active measures were run by the
KGB, which at its height employed ap-
proximately 15,000 officers devoted to
these tactics. The same State Depart-
ment report described the strategic ra-
tionale for such operations, stating:
‘‘Moscow seeks to disrupt relations be-
tween states, discredit opponents of
the USSR, and undermine foreign lead-
ers, institutions and values.’’
The tactics of contemporary Russian
information warfare mirrors Soviet-era
active measures but have gained vastly
greater potency in the digital age.
The irony is, these are the tactics the
Soviets employed, but they have been
supercharged because in a digital age,
you can reach more people, you can be
more effective. Under Putin, Russia
has institutionalized informational
warfare with a 21st century twist that
capitalizes on the interconnectedness
of our global society in the speed and
reach of today’s informational age
through cyber space.
This has important advantages for
Moscow. For example, the Soviet-era
KGB agents worked for years to get an
information warfare campaign to ‘‘go
viral’’ and be picked up in multiple
news outlets. Today, GRU- and Krem-
lin-linked troll organizations spread
propaganda and disinformation cam-
paigns across social media platforms
with ease—virtually instantaneously.
These information warfare oper-
ations are not simply opportunistic
meddling by Russia. Russia’s purpose is
to further its strategic interests. Putin
seeks to advance several strategic ob-
jectives, including preserving his grip
on power and enhancing his ability to
operate unconstrained domestically or
in Russia’s perceived sphere of influ-
ence near and abroad.
Putin further seeks for Russia to be
seen as an equal to the United States
on the world stage and regain the great
power status it lost at the end of the
Cold War. Putin knows that for now,
Russia cannot effectively compete with
the United States in conventionally
military ways and win. Instead, Putin
seeks to use tools from his hybrid war-
fare arsenal, including information
warfare to divide the United States
from our allies and partners in the
West and weaken our institutions and
open society from within. By weak-
ening our democracy, Putin can make
Russia look more powerful in compari-
son.
It is not surprising that Putin, who
spent most of his Soviet career in the
KGB and its successor, the FSB, has
deployed these techniques during his
rule. Putin mourned the downfall of
the Soviet Union, lamenting in 2005
that the breakup of the Soviet Union
was, in his words, ‘‘the greatest geo-
political tragedy of the 20th century.’’
When he assumed power, Putin revi-
talized a number of methods of hybrid
warfare from the Soviet system, in-
cluding information warfare. Over
time, Putin came to see Russia’s near-
ly continuous campaign of information
confrontation with the West as both a
justified and defensive response to per-
ceived U.S.-led international activism,
regardless of our intentions. Keir Giles
confirms this idea, assessing that Rus-
sia interpreted the color revolutions in
former Soviet states and the Arab
Spring as resulting from information
operations by the United States and
the West. Those operations were seen
as posing a serious and growing threat
to Putin’s rule.
The Kremlin’s development of its in-
formation warfare capabilities reflects
those perceptions and Putin’s concern
with preservation of his regime. Putin
moved from earlier ad hoc information
warfare campaigns, such as the oper-
ations against Estonia in 2007 and in
Georgia in 2008, to the systematic ap-
plication of these tools.
Most experts point to the Russian’s
public reaction to Putin’s return to the
Presidency for a third term in 2012 as
the turning point that led to develop-
ment of Russian information warfare
as we experience it today.
It began with the announcement in
September 2011 that Putin—then act-
ing as Prime Minister—and Medvedev—
then serving as President—would
switch roles. This revelation, coupled
with the rigged parliamentary elec-
tions in late 2011, created an unex-
pected backlash from the Russian peo-
ple. Massive demonstrations ensued,
with thousands of people taking to the
streets. To Putin, the grievances of the
protests appeared personal as they
chanted ‘‘Putin is a thief’’ and ‘‘Russia
without Putin.’’
The year of 2011 is particularly rel-
evant for revolutions and the over-
throw of dictatorships. The year 2011
gave rise to the Arab Spring, in which
dissidents relied heavily on Facebook
and Twitter—American inventions—to
organize their protests and cast-off au-
thoritarian governance in places across
the Middle East. Again, Putin con-
ceived U.S. actions in places such as
Egypt and Libya as proof that the
United States actively cultivated re-
gime change. Protests in Russia began
to resemble the protests of the Arab
Spring, including the similar use of
Facebook and Twitter. Putin viewed
these activities as a threat to his hold
on power.
Around that time, then-Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton raised concerns
about the Kremlin’s electoral conduct.
She urged that the ‘‘Russian people,
like people everywhere, deserve the
right to have their voices heard and
their votes counted.’’ In response,
Putin accused the United States of
interfering in the Russian elections
and blamed Secretary Clinton for the
massive protests taking place in Rus-
sia, alleging that Secretary Clinton
gave the, in his words, ‘‘signal to some
actors in our country to rise up.’’ He
further bemoaned what he called ‘‘for-
eign money’’ being used to influence
Russian politics and warned: ‘‘We need
to safeguard ourselves from this influ-
ence in our internal affairs.’’
After his inauguration for a third
term, Putin promoted a close ally and
tasked him with getting control over
the Russian’s people use of the inter-
net. Putin and his cronies also put po-
litical pressure on the creators of
prominent websites. Those who were
not willing to cooperate, such as the
owner of the Russian version of
Facebook, were pushed out so that the
chosen oligarchs could become major-
ity shareholders and then begin to con-
trol content.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S569
January 24, 2019
About the same time, the Russian
Parliament passed legislation helping
the Kremlin monitor and criminalize
unfavorable cyber activities. In concert
with the new online restrictions, the
Kremlin began paying bloggers to slip
in pro-Russian material amongst other
benign posts, which was the beginning
of government-directed troll oper-
ations.
In late 2013, a leading Russian news-
paper reported that the tools put in
place to co-opt new forms of media
were ‘‘recognized as so effective that
[the Kremlin] insiders send these weap-
ons outside—to the Americans and Eu-
ropean audiences.’’ This may mark the
beginning of Putin’s move to institu-
tionalize a more sustained and perma-
nent state of information confronta-
tion with the West.
Russia also used these external oper-
ations to further develop its toolkit for
information warfare. Central to these
efforts included what many experts
agreed was the development of a hybrid
warfare doctrine, as articulated by the
chief of the general staff of a Russian
Armed Forces general, Valery
Gerasimov, in 2013.
Gerasimov argued that asymmetric
approaches to dealing with conflict, in-
cluding the use of ‘‘political, economic
informational, humanitarian, and
other nonmilitary measures,’’ have
grown and in many instances have ‘‘ex-
ceeded the power of force and weapons
in their effectiveness.’’ He further dis-
cussed how hybrid warfare tactics, in-
cluding what he termed ‘‘informational
actions,’’ can nullify the enemy’s ad-
vantage and reduce its fighting poten-
tial. One of his conclusions was ‘‘that
it is necessary to perfect activities in
the information space,’’ including the
defense of our own objectives.
About the same time, in August 2013,
RT, which is a Russian television sta-
tion, reported on Russian plans to cre-
ate a new branch of the military that
would ‘‘include monitoring and proc-
essing external information as well as
fighting cyber threats.’’
In the article, Putin acknowledged
that information attacks are already
being applied to solve problems of a
military and political nature and that
their striking force may be higher than
those of conventional weapons.
Based on RT’s reporting and observa-
tions of the GRU’s activities, it is clear
that Russia has created ‘‘information
warfare troops’’ with no parallel in the
United States. These GRU units com-
bine the arts of technical cyber oper-
ations with psychological manipula-
tion. Malcolm Nance, a former U.S.
naval intelligence officer, character-
ized the GRU as ‘‘the armed forces of
Russia and the intelligence apparatus
that does reconnaissance, surveillance,
and . . . strategic cyber operations.’’
Russian security services expert
Mark Galeotti explained:
[H]istorically, the GRU has been Russia’s
main agency for operating in uncontrolled
spaces, which mean civil wars and the like.
In some ways, the internet is today’s uncon-
trolled space.
In hindsight, we can trace Russia’s
development and conduct of its infor-
mation warfare campaign against per-
ceived foreign threats from its neigh-
bors and the West. These campaigns
generally progressed along three major
lines of effort, all of which benefited
from advances in technology from the
Soviet days.
First, the campaigns involved overt
propaganda and disinformation, much
of it carried out on Russian state-
owned media, such as RT and Sputnik.
The second line of effort involved
covert cyber attacks, including hack-
ing and weaponizing stolen informa-
tion.
The third line of effort in the Russian
information campaigns involved
weaponizing the internet, particularly
social media networks, to amplify mes-
sages to a vastly greater audience and
promote themes that advanced Rus-
sia’s strategic interests.
While Russia’s technical and psycho-
logical capabilities grew over time, the
outlines of the Russian information
warfare playbook were evident during
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014
and during the United Kingdom’s
Brexit debate the following year, but
we largely did not understand the ex-
tent of these operations and the threat
to our national security and that of our
allies and partners. Our collective fail-
ure to understand the pattern of Rus-
sian information warfare emboldened
Putin. The Kremlin’s tactics and tech-
niques were further refined and de-
ployed in the Russian information
campaign against the U.S. Presidential
election in 2016.
Starting in 2014 and 2015, Putin
turned his information arsenal first on
the near abroad, deploying information
warfare operations against Ukraine
during the conflict over Crimea and
eastern Ukraine. Russia used Ukraine
as a testing laboratory for experi-
menting with new tactics of informa-
tion warfare through cyber space and
social media.
The impetus for Russian intervention
in the Ukraine arose in response to do-
mestic unrest which caused the Rus-
sian-backed Ukrainian President to
flee the country. Events tipped off
when Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovych signaled he was no longer
willing to continue efforts to integrate
Ukraine with the West, which had
broad public support. Instead, he ac-
cepted a Kremlin offer of a $15 billion
bailout for Ukraine and a deal on gas
imports.
Protests broke out, which grew into
what was known as the Maidan revolu-
tion. The numbers and strength of the
protests alarmed the Kremlin. Putin
wanted to ensure Ukraine stayed in
Russia’s sphere of influence. He de-
ployed hybrid warfare, including a full-
scale information warfare campaign, to
force the Ukrainian people back in
line. The goal of the information war-
fare campaign was to convince the peo-
ple of Ukraine that they were in immi-
nent danger from fascists and Nazis
who were taking over the country and
committing atrocities on their fellow
citizens.
The Kremlin deployed all three lines
of effort that I laid out for their infor-
mation warfare campaign against
Ukraine—a barrage of overt propa-
ganda and disinformation; cyber at-
tacks, including weaponizing stolen in-
formation; and the manipulation of the
internet and social media platforms.
These efforts sowed fear and magnified
mistrust toward the Ukrainian Govern-
ment, which the Kremlin was able to
exploit for the seizure of Crimea and to
achieve other Russian strategic inter-
ests.
The Russian campaign deployed a
significant volume of propaganda and
disinformation against Ukraine to
magnify a climate of fear and distrust
amongst the Ukrainian people. Exam-
ples include photos doctored to look
like scenes of carnage from Ukraine,
fake stories of dead children caught in
the crossfire, supposed attacks on Jew-
ish Ukrainians who were forced to flee
the country, and, allegedly, a 3-year-
old who was crucified by Ukrainian sol-
diers. The messages also portrayed the
Russians as the Ukrainian people’s sav-
iors and that Russia had to intervene
to help restore order.
The second line of effort—covert
military operations in cyber space—
was also deployed as a Russian cam-
paign against Ukraine. At the time, at-
tacks against Ukraine were described
as coming from CyberBerkut, which
the U.K. Government’s National Cyber
Security Centre has recently an-
nounced ‘‘is almost certainly’’ the
same branch of the GRU that infil-
trated the Democratic National Com-
mittee. The GRU forces responsible for
these ‘‘hack-and-weaponize’’ informa-
tion operations were later named by
their unit numbers in Special Counsel
Mueller’s July 2018 indictment and
have been given many names, including
CyberBerkut, Fancy Bear, and Ad-
vanced Persistent Threat (APT) 28.
In the spring of 2014, as Ukraine held
its Presidential election, CyberBerkut
penetrated Ukraine’s Central Election
Commission, directly altering the na-
tionwide Presidential vote tallies in
favor of Russia’s preferred candidate.
The Ukrainian officials caught the
change before the results were an-
nounced, although it was broadcast on
Russian news that the Russian-backed
candidate had won, sowing doubt on
the validity of the election and magni-
fying distrust in the Ukrainian Govern-
ment.
Seeing as how they couldn’t change
voting tallies and fully get away with
it, Russia’s tactics evolved to try to
change people’s minds about whom to
vote for or make the public so distrust-
ful of the system that they wouldn’t
vote at all. These same units began to
steal private information through
cyber intrusions on Ukrainian Govern-
ment and political officials and
weaponize it by posting it on the inter-
net. As the Defense Intelligence Agen-
cy noted in the ‘‘Russia Military

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S570 January 24, 2019
Power’’ report from 2017, the intent of
publicizing the stolen information was
‘‘to demoralize, embarrass and create
distrust of elected officials.’’
A third line of effort by the Russian
campaign focused on leveraging cyber
space to reinforce and amplify their
messaging, which was carried out by
the GRU and Kremlin-linked troll or-
ganizations. While these efforts were
often unsophisticated, this may have
been the first time that organizations
embarked on wide-scale social media
campaigns to amplify information war-
fare beyond Russia’s borders.
The Washington Post reported, based
on internal Russian military docu-
ments, that the GRU fabricated numer-
ous accounts on social media after
Ukrainian President Yanukovych fled
in 2014. These accounts on Facebook
and the Russian version of Facebook,
known as VK, posed as ordinary
Ukrainians who were against the Kiev
protests. They preyed on people’s emo-
tions, magnifying fear and distrust.
One example of a message posted by
the GRU from a fraudulent social
media account was ‘‘brigades of West-
erners are now on their way to rob and
kill us. . . . Morals have been replaced
by thirst for blood and hatred toward
anything Russian.’’ The same GRU
unit was also responsible for the cre-
ation of the fictitious persona ‘‘Ivan
Galitsin,’’ who placed pro-Kremlin
comments on English language
websites.
The intercepted Russian military
documents also detailed how the GRU
created four fraudulent groups on
Facebook and its Russian equivalent to
support its campaign in Crimea and
used paid Facebook ads to increase
traffic to their fraudulent sites.
Subsequent reporting by the Wash-
ington Post uncovered the specific
GRU unit—54777. The GRU unit respon-
sible for this operation bragged to their
superiors that these 4 groups alone re-
ceived at least 200,000 views.
All of these tactics would appear in
later information warfare campaigns.
This information warfare campaign
against Ukraine also appears to be one
of the first uses of a complementary so-
cial media effort—deploying Kremlin-
linked trolls—against the population of
a foreign country to enhance and am-
plify the GRU operation.
A close Putin crony, Yevgeny
Prigozhin, founded and funded the op-
eration—known as the Internet Re-
search Agency and its related compa-
nies—to amplify the Kremlin’s mes-
sages across social media platforms.
According to a Russian press report in
2014, during the Ukraine operations,
the Internet Research Agency was em-
ploying about 250 people to engage in
online discussions ‘‘with a goal to un-
dermine the authority of Ukrainian
politicians and post hate speech and
fake stories, thus shifting attention
from the real events.’’ Copying the
model that the Kremlin developed to
manipulate its own citizens, these fake
Ukrainian personas would pretend to
be regular, local Ukrainian people and
slip in politically charged messages.
BuzzFeed detailed one such campaign
entitled ‘‘Polite People’’ which ‘‘pro-
moted the invasion of Crimea with pic-
tures of Russian troops posing along-
side girls, the elderly, and cats.’’ The
trolls used innocuous pictures to gain a
group of followers; then they were eas-
ily able to pump out pro-Kremlin mes-
sages to readymade audiences.
Although the tactics were relatively
simplistic—both for whom they were
trying to reach and the technical as-
pects of their campaign—the Kremlin
information warfare campaign ap-
peared largely successful against
Ukraine and contributed to the Krem-
lin’s seizure of Crimea. Indeed, Gen.
Philip Breedlove, then head of the U.S.
European Command and NATO Su-
preme Allied Commander Europe,
warned at the time that Russia was
‘‘waging the most amazing information
warfare blitzkrieg in the history of in-
formation warfare.’’
Even as these information operations
overwhelmed Ukraine, the potential
threat they posed to Western societies
was largely unrecognized, and calls for
help in combatting these types of cam-
paigns—including manipulation of so-
cial media—went unanswered.
The Washington Post reported last
October that high-level Ukrainian offi-
cials, including President
Poroschenko, personally appealed to
Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg in the
spring of 2015. One of his deputies stat-
ed that they told Facebook: ‘‘I was ex-
plicitly saying that there were troll
factories, that their posts and reposts
promoted posts and news that are fake.
. . . Have a look.’’ Facebook officials
failed to take these pleas seriously and
in 2015 declined President
Poroschenko’s request to open a
Facebook office in Kiev to address the
problem. In a foreshadowing of events
in the United States, Facebook failed
to imagine the significant impact these
campaigns could have on Ukrainian
politics and security. Our government,
too, failed to realize the full extent of
the threat.
While we have been able to uncover a
lot about Russian attacks on Ukraine,
we have not been able to piece together
the full picture of what Russia per-
petrated against the United Kingdom
in connection with the spring 2016 ref-
erendum on whether the United King-
dom should leave the EU, commonly
known as Brexit.
UK members of Parliament and oth-
ers investigating these attacks have
been able to piece together evidence
that the Kremlin mounted an informa-
tion warfare campaign to encourage
and amplify anti-EU sentiment in the
run up to voting day. However, because
these investigations are limited to
their committees of jurisdiction and
there is no equivalent to the U.S. spe-
cial counsel’s investigation pulling the
disparate pieces of information to-
gether, we have yet to understand the
full picture of what the Russians per-
petrated against the British people.
What we have learned so far indicates
that the Kremlin appeared to run a
more sophisticated campaign against
the British people than the attacks it
perpetrated against Ukraine. In this
operation, the Kremlin was pushing
one side of the argument, as they were
in Ukraine, but they showcased in-
creased psychological complexities in
their attacks. This campaign focused
on targeting segments of the British
population that would likely be fright-
ened by threats of increased immigra-
tion, particularly from Muslim-major-
ity countries. The Kremlin and Krem-
lin-linked actors also pushed messages
that the EU was corrupt and had little
accountability to the people of the
United Kingdom, which magnified feel-
ings of mistrust of the EU.
The first line of effort for this Krem-
lin information warfare campaign and
the one that the West was able to track
and analyze was propaganda and
disinformation. The Kremlin unleashed
a slew of overt Russian propaganda in
English, advanced on TV and the inter-
net by Kremlin-controlled media out-
lets. A United Kingdom parliamentary
inquiry on disinformation cites 261 ar-
ticles on RT and Sputnik with a heavy
anti-EU bias in the 6 months prior to
the referendum. These outlets ad-
vanced a steady drumbeat of stories
stressing the continued dangers as long
as the United Kingdom remained part
of the EU’s so-called ‘‘open borders.’’
This included disinformation intended
to magnify fear by alleging that Brit-
ish women would be subject to in-
creased attacks from dangerous Mus-
lim immigrants.
It has yet to be determined whether
the second line of effort—covert GRU
operations in cyber space—was de-
ployed as part of the Russian campaign
promoting Brexit. It does not appear
that hacking and weaponizing stolen
data was deployed in connection with
Brexit. However, as detailed in a sepa-
rate parliamentary inquiry, on the
night of the Brexit referendum, there
was a suspicious crash of the voter reg-
istration website likely attributed to
denial-of-service attacks.
The timing of this attack appears
consistent with other GRU covert
cyber attacks, which aim to take key
infrastructure or information offline at
crucial times to advance Kremlin ob-
jectives. This crude information war-
fare tactic has been tied to GRU in pre-
vious operations, particularly Eastern
Europe. Further, the UK Government
has been able to tie the GRU to other
cyber attacks, including attacks on a
United Kingdom television station and
the United Kingdom foreign office. If
these Russian actors were culpable in
this denial-of-service attack, then it
would fit with the Russian playbook.
The third line of effort, the use of
cyber space to amplify and reinforce
messaging, featured prominently in the
information warfare campaign relating
to Brexit. While we don’t know what
role, if any, the GRU played in this line
of effort, we have been able to identify

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S571
January 24, 2019
a sustained campaign on social media
against the British public by Kremlin
and Kremlin-linked actors. These at-
tacks included the use of trolls and
automated bots amplifying pro-leave
messages ahead of the date of ref-
erendum. The New York Times re-
ported that tweets from the Russian
accounts ‘‘sought to inflame fears
about Muslims and immigrants to help
drive the vote.’’ Tweets surged in the
last days of the campaign, spiking from
about 1,000 tweets a day to 45,000
tweets in the 48 hours prior to the polls
closing. In the final days before the ref-
erendum, less than 1 percent of Twitter
users accounted for one-third of all the
conversations surrounding the issue,
showing that these actions were artifi-
cially boosting the pro-leave messages
to increase viewership size.
Joint analysis from Swansea Univer-
sity and the University of California,
Berkeley, concluded that the attacks
emanated from 150,000 Russian-based
accounts and that their tweets were
viewed hundreds of millions of times.
It must be noted that Russian ampli-
fication efforts in connection with
Brexit also received a boost from local
surrogates in the UK. One pro-leave
local surrogate was Nigel Farage, then-
leader of the rightwing populist UKIP
Party. Whether unwittingly or not,
Farage echoed aspects of Russian prop-
aganda, including lending his voice to
stories broadcast on Russian propa-
ganda channel RT. Farage was also
often quoted in Russia media articles,
including when he warned that British
women could be at risk of mass attacks
of gangs of migrants due to ‘‘big cul-
tural issues’’ should Britain choose to
remain in the EU, again, echoing the
message that Russian agents and au-
thorities were promoting.
Here, too, it seems we have just
begun to scratch the surface of our un-
derstanding about what the Kremlin
was doing, including how they had in-
sight into whom to target with their
information warfare campaign. Mem-
ber of Parliament Damian Collins, who
is leading an investigation into Rus-
sian disinformation connected to
Brexit, fears that what we know at this
point about the extent of the Russian
attack against the British people ‘‘may
well be just the tip of the iceberg.’’
We can’t point with all certitude to
whether the Kremlin’s information
warfare campaign made a difference in
the outcome of the vote. However, we
know that those who voted to leave the
EU won by a small margin. It was a
stunning upset that no one expected,
let alone then-Prime Minister Cam-
eron. He cited the outcome as the rea-
son for his resignation.
The Kremlin has also turned these
weapons on the United States. The
most prominent example was the sus-
tained, multipronged information war-
fare campaign deployed against the
American people, as I stated, during
the 2016 Presidential election. While
the Kremlin’s information warfare
campaign against Ukraine and Brexit
supported and amplified one side of an
issue, for this operation Russia showed
increased technical and psychological
advances by targeting multiple aspects
of contentious issues to advance the
Kremlin’s objectives. Grievances about
race, religion, immigration, social jus-
tice, and even U.S. institutions writ
large were woven into anti-Clinton,
pro-Trump fabric. These efforts were a
toxic mix, trying to poison Clinton’s
candidacy, promote Trump’s
favorability, taint the electoral proc-
ess, and weaken democratic institu-
tions altogether.
Similar to the information warfare
campaign against Brexit, we are still
trying to get a full picture of how Rus-
sia attacked us during the 2016 election
and, particularly, the role that the
GRU played. But what is now clear is
that the Kremlin’s information warfare
campaign regarding the 2016 election
was not neutral or even-handed in its
messaging on Clinton compared to that
of President Trump. As affirmed in the
intelligence community’s January 2017
assessment, in their words: ‘‘Putin or-
dered an influence campaign in 2016
aimed at the U.S. presidential election,
the consistent goals of which were to
undermine public faith in the U.S.
democratic process, denigrate Sec-
retary Clinton, and harm her
electability and potential presidency.’’
They also assessed, in their words,
that ‘‘Putin and the Russian Govern-
ment developed a clear preference’’ for
President Trump. Similarly, Special
Counsel Mueller’s February indictment
against the Kremlin-linked troll oper-
ation found that the Russians ‘‘en-
gaged in operations primarily intended
to communicate derogatory informa-
tion about Hillary Clinton, to deni-
grate other candidates such as TED
CRUZ and MARCO RUBIO, and to support
BERNIE SANDERS and the candidate
Donald Trump.’’
The clear anti-Clinton and pro-
Trump themes in Russia’s efforts
aligned with Russian strategic inter-
ests. As mentioned earlier, Putin
blamed Hillary Clinton for protests in
Russia in December 2011. Weakening
Clinton as a candidate would reduce
the perceived threat to Putin’s grip on
power from a Clinton Presidency.
President Trump, on the other hand,
offered Russia a freer hand in con-
ducting its affairs.
Similar to Brexit, the Russian infor-
mation warfare campaign against the
American people in 2016 demonstrated
a high degree of sophistication in tar-
geting susceptible groups of Ameri-
cans, potentially including the use of
data analytics. We are still learning
details of how the Russians were able
to build an audience for its information
warfare attacks and whether they had
any help from any Americans. How-
ever, Justice Department indictments,
including those from the special coun-
sel, and two reports commissioned by
the Senate Intelligence Committee
analyzing data provided by social
media companies are providing a better
picture of the information warfare
campaigns against us.
One of those reports, a joint study by
Oxford University and the social media
analytics firm Graphika, assessed that
the Kremlin-linked troll organization
was able to segment users into dif-
ferent groups based on ‘‘race, eth-
nicity, and identity.’’ Once they cat-
egorized people in such a manner, they
tailored ads to entice users to engage
with their fraudulent accounts and
pages. This process engineered mes-
sages to manipulate and polarize recep-
tive audiences. The other study com-
missioned by the Senate Intelligence
Committee, a collaboration between
the social media research firm New
Knowledge, Columbia University, and
Canfield Research, confirms this idea,
detailing how specific ethnic and Rus-
sian groups were targeted. Their anal-
ysis concluded that these operations
were directed overwhelmingly at Afri-
can Americans. As the Washington
Post technology reporter Craig
Timberg explained, social media com-
panies created this technology and, in
the process, have ‘‘atomized’’ us into
different categories and put us into a
‘‘thousand different buckets.’’ The Rus-
sians co-opted this American tech-
nology, just as they have exploited
other aspects of our open society and
democratic system, and weaponized it
against us.
Similar to campaigns in the past,
this information warfare operation fol-
lowed the three established lines of ef-
fort as detailed in the intelligence
community’s January 2017 assessment.
The Kremlin’s campaign ‘‘followed a
longstanding Russian messaging strat-
egy that blends covert intelligence op-
erations—such as cyber activity—with
overt efforts by Russian Government
agencies, state-funded media, third-
party intermediaries and paid social
media users or trolls.’’
The first line of effort involved overt
propaganda and disinformation focus-
ing on a number of themes that ad-
vanced Russia’s strategic interest.
Having tested their methodology in
previous campaigns, including in
Ukraine and Brexit, the Russians had
an arsenal of tried-and-tested methods
of influence they deployed in the U.S.
Presidential election to maximize fear
and distrust.
Propaganda and disinformation to
stoke these negative emotions were
pumped out by Kremlin-funded chan-
nels RT and Sputnik. They sought to
flood an unsuspecting American public
with stories portraying Secretary Clin-
ton as untrustworthy and dangerous,
thus amplifying negative feelings to-
ward her. Articles painted Clinton as a
warmonger who would lead the United
States into future conflicts or alleged
that she was of ill health and hiding
her condition from the public. Addi-
tional reports were aimed at bolstering
the perceptions that she was not trust-
worthy and accused her of nefarious
dealings detailed in the emails she de-
leted as a coverup of her so-called
‘‘crimes.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S572 January 24, 2019
A third group of accounts alleged
that Clinton used her high-ranking po-
sition as Secretary of State to enrich
her family foundation with foreign do-
nations by engaging in quid quo pro
schemes. In contrast, Kremlin-funded
media pushed positive stories about
President Trump, promoting him as a
pragmatist who understood that the
United States needed to stop inter-
fering in the internal affairs of other
countries.
An additional widely used theme,
which sought to maximize feelings of
distrust and ran through much of what
Kremlin media broadcast, revolved
around corruption in the United
States, American hypocrisy, and that
our elections were rigged and fraudu-
lent. Painting the American political
system as unfair, biased, and tainted
served Putin’s strategic interests, al-
lowing the Kremlin to counter pro-de-
mocracy forces within Russia by as-
serting a moral equivalence between a
‘‘flawed’’ American democratic system
and his autocratic rule of Russia.
The second line of effort in the Krem-
lin’s information warfare playbook,
covert Russian operations in cyber
space, repeated tactics used against
Ukraine but this time with greater so-
phistication. In particular, the Kremlin
and Kremlin-linked actors engaged in
hacking and weaponizing the release of
stolen data. From what our intel-
ligence community, the Department of
Justice, and FBI have compiled, it ap-
pears that the GRU undertook the larg-
est share of this aspect of the informa-
tion warfare campaign, with com-
plementary efforts undertaken by the
FSB. The special counsel’s indictment
from July 2018 detailed how the GRU
‘‘intentionally conspired . . . to gain
unauthorized access into the com-
puters of U.S. persons and entities in-
volved in the 2016 election, steal docu-
ments from those computers and stage
releases of the stolen documents to
interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential
election.’’
As we now know, two of the main
targets of this operation were the DNC
and Clinton campaign chairman, John
Podesta. Press reports indicate that
approximately 50,000 emails and docu-
ments were stolen.
Once in possession of these stolen
documents, the GRU repeated its play-
book from the earlier campaigns. It
sought to weaponize the hacked infor-
mation by releasing it in a manner and
at key times when it could cause the
most damage, while concealing Rus-
sia’s role in the process. As the Mueller
indictment against the GRU describes,
‘‘They did so using fictitious online
personas, including ‘DCLeaks’ and
‘Guccifer 2.0.’’’
The Mueller indictment from last
July further detailed the GRU’s use of
fake persona, Guccifer 2.0, which the
GRU falsely claimed was a Romanian
hacker. Guccifer 2.0 released stolen
documents and was active in pro-
moting so-called ‘‘exclusives’’ of stolen
information as a way to launder it to
third parties, including journalists
from traditional media outlets.
The GRU’s covert efforts also took
advantage of a willing amplifier,
WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks had an estab-
lished reputation for spilling State se-
crets, including those of the U.S. Gov-
ernment and military. WikiLeaks also
offered a ready-made audience and had
an understanding of how to time re-
leases for political impact. Indeed, ac-
cording to the Mueller indictment, the
GRU, posing as Guccifer 2.0 ‘‘discussed
the release of the stolen documents and
the timing of those releases’’ with
WikiLeaks ‘‘to heighten their impact
on the 2016 presidential election.’’
WikiLeaks released the stolen docu-
ments during the Democratic National
Convention to cause conflict between
Clinton and Sanders supporters at a
time when many Americans were very
likely to be paying attention.
WikiLeaks also released documents in
the last few weeks of the election,
again, when the Nation was very likely
to be following campaigns. The first re-
lease of stolen emails from the Clinton
campaign chairman, John Podesta, co-
incided with a warning from the De-
partment of Homeland Security and Of-
fice of the Director of National Intel-
ligence in October 2016 about Russian
attacks against our election. It also oc-
curred on the same day as the release
of the Trump ‘‘Access Hollywood’’
tape. These efforts, too, suggest a high
level of sophistication that hadn’t been
seen in earlier Russian influence cam-
paigns.
The third component of the Russian
information warfare campaign, mes-
sage amplification and reinforcement
through social media, was deployed in
parallel with the other lines of effort to
achieve an unprecedented impact.
While we don’t know the full extent of
the GRU’s involvement, the Mueller in-
dictment revealed that an entire mili-
tary intelligence unit—74455—was ac-
tive in this line of effort. In his July
2018 indictment, the special counsel ex-
plained that unit No. 74455 assisted in
the promotion of the released stolen
material ‘‘and the publication of anti-
Clinton contact on social media ac-
counts operated by the GRU.’’
That includes the site DCLeaks,
which was, in fact, established by the
GRU. It went live in early June 2016,
posing as a site run by American
hacktivists, promising to ‘‘expose the
truth’’ about U.S. politicians. The GRU
even created a DCLeaks Facebook
page, authored by the fictitious U.S.
woman Alice Donovan, which sought to
drive traffic to its site. The July in-
dictment further details how the GRU
used additional fake accounts posing as
Americans named Jason Scott and
Richard Gingrey to promote the
DCLeaks site. Before it was shut down
in March of 2017, the DCLeaks site was
viewed over a million times.
The GRU also used social media to
magnify fears about Hillary Clinton.
The July indictment from the special
counsel revealed that the GRU was the
true operator behind the fraudulent
Twitter account @BaltimoreIsWhr
[Baltimore is War], which encouraged
U.S. audiences to ‘‘[j]oin our flash
mob’’ opposing Clinton and to share
images with the hashtag ‘‘Blacks
Against Hillary.’’
In addition to the GRU’s weaponizing
social media against the United States,
there was a complementary effort from
the Kremlin-linked troll organization,
the Internet Research Agency. By the
2016 U.S. Presidential election, the de-
ployment of the troll organization ap-
peared to be a standard part of the
Kremlin’s playbook. The October 2018
indictment of the Internet Research
Agency’s accountant in the Eastern
District of Virginia provides additional
confirmation of the troll organization’s
role in the information campaign. The
indictment confirms the existence of
the Agency’s operation known as
Project Lakhta—since at least May of
2014—and notes that this project tar-
geted Ukraine, Europe, and the United
States with a stated goal in the United
States to ‘‘spread distrust toward can-
didates for political office and the po-
litical system in general.’’ Social
media researchers, including P.W.
Singer, have also noted how some of
the same trolls were repurposed for dif-
ferent operations. The accounts that
pretended to be Ukrainian then posed
as British citizens and then as Ameri-
cans as the focus of attacks shifted
over time.
Against the United States, the troll
operation capitalized on issues of im-
portance to groups inside American so-
ciety to magnify fear and distrust in
ways that aligned with the Kremlin
strategic interest of hurting Clinton
and helping President Trump. As the
special counsel’s February indictment
detailed, ‘‘These groups and pages,
which addressed divisive U.S. political
and social issues, falsely claimed to be
controlled by U.S. activists when, in
fact, they were controlled by [Kremlin-
linked trolls].’’ The indictment further
asserted this was the manner in which
the troll organization reached ‘‘signifi-
cant numbers of Americans for the pur-
pose of influencing the Presidential
election of 2016.’’
The report prepared for the Senate
Intelligence Committee by New Knowl-
edge, Columbia, and Canfield Research
that analyzed certain data from social
media companies identifies a number
of tactics employed by the Internet Re-
search Agency in its assault on the 2016
election. These include building brands
across platforms, including Twitter,
Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram;
deploying or repurposing popular
memes to spread propaganda; rein-
forcing key themes by resharing the
same story across multiple accounts;
impersonating local media on Twitter
and Instagram to win the trust of
Americans in their local news; and am-
plifying conspiratorial narratives
among both left- and right-leaning au-
diences.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S573
January 24, 2019
As I mentioned, the report found that
one of the troll organization’s con-
certed lines of attack was against Afri-
can Americans. These efforts, however,
went beyond just trying to sow discord
and reinforce fears about Clinton. Cam-
paigns against African-American
groups were pushed across Twitter,
Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube
with the goal of suppressing voter
turnout ‘‘through malicious misdirec-
tion, candidate support redirection and
turnout depression.’’
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a scholar
who studies political campaigns, exam-
ined polling data throughout the cam-
paign and documented similar tactics
at disenfranchisement in her recent
book, including fake ads that encour-
aged minority viewers to text or tweet
their support for Clinton rather than
to vote at the polls or to rally support
for other candidates in the race. These
efforts may have been particularly ef-
fective in peeling off voters who would
have been likely to vote for her can-
didacy. They also may have influenced
undecided voters at a key time. Polls
in the final month of the campaign
showed a marked drop in the number of
Americans saying they intended to
vote for Secretary Clinton.
The reports prepared for the Senate
Intelligence Committee highlighted
that Twitter was an important compo-
nent of the attacks Kremlin-linked
troll organizations deployed against
the American people. The nearly 4,000
inauthentic Russian Twitter accounts,
like their Facebook counterparts, pro-
moted messages related to divisive so-
cial issues, such as gun control, race
relations, and immigration. The troll
organization also deployed bots, or
automated accounts, to amplify mes-
sages and drive traffic to specific
Facebook pages, Kremlin propaganda
sites, or other targeted websites. The
Kremlin-linked troll operation went
into overdrive on election day with
strategic messaging that mimicked the
spike in activity on Twitter during the
Brexit referendum. According to the
Daily Beast, Kremlin-linked trolls
began a ‘‘final push’’ and used ‘‘a com-
bination of high-profile accounts with
large and influential followings and
scores of lurking personas established
years earlier with stolen photos and
fabricated backgrounds’’ to send ‘‘care-
fully metered tweets and retweets voic-
ing praise for Trump and contempt for
his opponent from the early morning
until the last polls closed in the United
States.’’
As the recent studies commissioned
by the Senate Intelligence Committee
illuminate, the information warfare
campaign against the American people
was an extensive, widespread, coordi-
nated effort across many social media
platforms, both big and small. The in-
creased sophistication of the troll orga-
nization’s techniques on social media
provided a relatively low-cost but high-
ly effective method of influencing the
American public. For example, these
trolls spent only $100,000 on 3,000 ads on
Facebook. While this may seem like a
small amount compared to the millions
of dollars spent on the Presidential
campaign, the impact and reach of
these Kremlin ads, once amplified
through these Russian operations, was
extensive.
While Facebook estimates that ap-
proximately 126 million Americans saw
Kremlin-linked messages, Jonathan
Albright, the research director for Co-
lumbia University’s Tow Center for
Digital Journalism, extrapolated that
they could have been shared hundreds
of millions and, perhaps, many billions
of times. Kathleen Hall Jamieson con-
cluded that the widespread reach of the
troll organization’s disinformation ‘‘in-
creases the likelihood’’ that the Rus-
sian activities changed the outcome of
the election. A study from the Ohio
State University on propaganda and
disinformation affirmed Hall
Jamieson’s assessment and concluded
Russian information warfare attacks
‘‘most likely did have substantial im-
pact on the voting decisions of a stra-
tegically important set of voters—
those who voted for Barack Obama in
2012. Indeed, given the very narrow
margins of victory by Donald Trump in
key battleground states, this impact
may have been sufficient to deprive
Hillary Clinton of a victory in the
Electoral College.’’ That is their con-
clusion.
As with the Brexit campaign, the
Russian information warfare campaign
during the 2016 election was aided by
others who, either wittingly or unwit-
tingly, helped to advance Russia’s stra-
tegic objectives. Among these were
major American news outlets, which
covered much of what was in the
WikiLeaks disclosures. They treated it
as legitimate news without reminding
viewers of how the information was ob-
tained or that it was being pushed by a
foreign adversary. Thomas Rid, a pro-
fessor of security studies at King’s Col-
lege, testified to the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee in March of 2017
that the journalists functioned as ‘‘un-
witting agents . . . who aggressively
covered the political leaks while ne-
glecting or ignoring their provenance’’
or, as Kathleen Hall Jamieson con-
cludes, the American media ‘‘inadvert-
ently helped [the Russians] achieve
their goals.’’
Further, as in the Brexit campaign, a
number of local surrogates appeared to
echo the Kremlin messages. This in-
cluded associates of the Trump cam-
paign and even the President himself.
He boasted of his love of WikiLeaks at
least 124 times in the last month of the
election alone and even tweeted a link
to access the stolen disclosures from
WikiLeaks. According to the Wash-
ington Post, at least five close Trump
associates, albeit perhaps unknow-
ingly, retweeted messages from Krem-
lin-linked troll accounts, including the
account @Ten—GOP, a Russian fake
handle that impersonated the Ten-
nessee Republican Party.
The President and his campaign also
used talking points that were similar
to Russian propaganda and
disinformation, including disparaging
Secretary Clinton’s health and accus-
ing her repeatedly of being ‘‘crooked.’’
The President encouraged Russia, in
many respects, to continue these ac-
tivities. From what we know from the
July indictment from the special coun-
sel, the night that Trump called on the
Russians to hack her emails, the GRU
did, in fact, attack the server that
housed Clinton’s personal accounts. As
journalist and legal analyst Jeffrey
Toobin characterized it, ‘‘All of these
separate [Russian] efforts are com-
pletely aligned with Donald Trump’s
interests, often word for word.’’
Some have argued that despite this
extensive and sophisticated Russian in-
fluence campaign, there was no effect
on the outcome of the election because
no vote tallies were changed. While we
may never know definitively what the
actual impact of the Kremlin’s oper-
ation was, it is hard to believe that the
Kremlin would mount a sustained,
multiyear information warfare cam-
paign against our democratic institu-
tions if it had no reason to expect that
it would have an impact. To the con-
trary, based on its experience in
Ukraine, Brexit, and elsewhere, the
Kremlin had every reason to believe
that it could successfully influence the
outcome of the 2016 election with mini-
mal risk of being discovered or suf-
fering retaliation.
As I have laid out, Russia is engaged
in a sustained information warfare
campaign against the United States,
our allies, and partners. This Russian
interference can’t be dismissed as a
one-off operation. As Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein told the Aspen
Forum last July, the Russian effort to
influence the 2016 Presidential election
is ‘‘just one tree in a growing forest.
Russian intelligence officers did not
stumble onto the idea of hacking
American computers and posting mis-
leading messages because they had a
free afternoon. It is what they do every
day.’’ Our intelligence community as-
sessed in January 2017 that the cam-
paign against us represented a ‘‘new
normal’’ in Russian influence efforts in
which ‘‘Moscow will apply lessons
learned from its campaign aimed at the
U.S. presidential election to future in-
fluence efforts in the U.S. and world-
wide.’’
Russian information warfare oper-
ations have a real and ongoing impact
on our national security. Russia has
not paused its information warfare op-
erations since the 2016 election, and, in
fact, the level of Russian operations
has increased since then. As John
Kelly, the founder of Graphika, a social
media intelligence firm, who testified
to the Senate Intelligence Committee
in August and who collaborated on one
of the reports for the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee I discussed earlier,
stated: ‘‘After election day, the Rus-
sian government stepped on the gas

on our democratic process is much big-
ger than the attack on a single elec-
tion.’’ This idea was confirmed by data
in both his report and the other report
commissioned by the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee on the Kremlin-
linked troll organization.
The report done by New Knowledge,
Columbia University, and Canfield re-
search noted that the Kremlin-linked
troll organization went after those who
are investigating Russian information
warfare and other malign influence ac-
tivities in the United States, including
attempts to label Russian interference
in the election as ‘‘nonsense’’ and cast-
ing former FBI Director James Comey
and Special Counsel Mueller as cor-
rupt.
We don’t have to look too far for
other examples of Russia’s ongoing
campaign against the American people
and our allies and partners. Kremlin-
linked troll operations flooded Twitter
with messages that were intended to
sow division and disinformation in the
wake of numerous controversies, in-
cluding the tragic shootings in Las
Vegas and Parkland, FL, and during
the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings.
Last September, we learned from an in-
dictment in the Western District of
Pennsylvania that GRU officers, in-
cluding some agents who were pre-
viously indicted by Special Counsel
Mueller, attempted information at-
tacks against prominent world organi-
zations, including those who were in-
vestigating Russian malign influence
activities.
It is now clear that Russian informa-
tion operations also targeted the 2018
midterm elections. The October indict-
ment from the Eastern District of Vir-
ginia details an ongoing and advanced
operation to influence the American
electorate up through 2018. As the in-
dictment states, this campaign ‘‘has a
strategic goal, which continues to this
day, to sow division and discord in the
U.S. political system.’’ The indictment
also details how Russian troll oper-
ations are using U.S.-based virtual pri-
vate networks, or VPNs, paid for with
Bitcoin through multiple bank ac-
counts, to disguise the origin of Rus-
sian messaging on social media.
The sophistication of these oper-
ations continues to increase. The Inter-
net Research Agency has a dedicated
‘‘search engine optimization’’ depart-
ment that is devoted to manipulating
social media search algorithms to ad-
vance the goals of Russian troll oper-
ations. The troll organization spent
millions of dollars annually in 2017 and
2018 and is still buying ads on
Facebook and Instagram. These oper-
ations continue to cover a broad range
of divisive issues, and as the indict-
ment details, the organization’s em-
ployees are instructed on strategies
and guidance for targeting particular
audiences with carefully tailored mes-
sages. Despite efforts by Facebook and
Twitter to eliminate inauthentic ac-
counts, there are still thousands of ac-
tive social media and email accounts
appearing to be U.S. persons when they
are, in fact, Kremlin-linked trolls that
are acting as part of an information
warfare campaign.
Last February, in testimony before
the Armed Services Cyber Sub-
committee, Russia expert Heather
Conley warned that Russian informa-
tion warfare campaigns in 2018 and 2020
will adapt and ‘‘look more American,
and [it] will look less Russian.’’ The
New Knowledge, Columbia University,
and Canfield research study notes that
we need to be on the lookout for in-
creasingly sophisticated operations, in-
cluding ‘‘increased human-exploitation
tradecraft and narrative laundering.’’
The technology already exists to cre-
ate ‘‘deepfakes,’’ false videos of real
people saying or doing things that are
damaging. Advances in artificial intel-
ligence are enabling rapid, automated
responses on social media that mimic
authentic accounts.
We are still gathering data about in-
formation warfare attacks, including
the 2018 midterms. Between the indict-
ments I referenced and the additional
Kremlin-directed troll operations dis-
covered by Facebook in conjunction
with our Intelligence Committee, the
FBI, and DHS, we seem to be getting
better at responding to the types of at-
tacks perpetrated against United
States in 2016, but that is no indicator
that we have become better at antici-
pating future attacks.
The Director of the Department of
Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency
warned last November that ‘‘the [2018]
midterm is . . . just the warm-up or
the exhibition game. . . . The big game
. . . for the adversaries is probably
2020.’’
I want to thank my colleague for
being generous and patient with my
presentation, but I do want to make, I
think, an important and concluding
point that ties in directly with what is
going on right now.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. President, we have been talking
about this shutdown. After I described
the activities that have transpired over
the last 5 to 10 years, we should be
aware that they are continuing, and
the consequences of this shutdown are
more than theoretical.
We are missing some of our most
critical tools for countering Russian
information warfare for protecting sys-
tems that are vital to our democracy.
As Andrew Grotto, a former cyber se-
curity adviser for Presidents Trump
and Obama stated, ‘‘Defending Federal
networks is already an act of triage
. . . furloughs make a hard job even
harder.’’
While I applaud DHS for reorganizing
into the new Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency, they have
since had to furlough 43 percent of
their employees. That is over 1,500
workers who right now are unable to
continue key missions and protect us
from attack.
The FBI is also affected by the shut-
down in critical functions related to
countering Russian hybrid and infor-
mation warfare.
A recent FBI Agent’s Association re-
port highlighted how efforts to inves-
tigate and prosecute cyber criminals
have been impacted. That includes a
lack of resources to pay for wiretaps
and subpoenas. One anonymous FBI
agent quoted in the report remarked:
‘‘These delays slow down our work to
combat criminal activity on the [inter-
net] and protect the American people.’’
All the while, Russia continues to at-
tack us with information warfare.
They were not closed for business. With
this unnecessary government shut-
down, we are fighting blindfolded with
one hand tied behind our backs.
I am confident in the ability of our
government and our society to come
together. I am confident that with the
American vision and ingenuity, work-
ing across the aisle and across the At-
lantic, these are challenges that we can
meet and conquer, but we must remem-
ber that this is not a Democratic or
Republican problem.
This is an attack against the Nation
by a foreign power. This is a problem of
our national security. We have no time
to waste. If we are looking for another
reason why we should open this govern-
ment immediately, it is to continue
our protection against the attacks by
foreign entities.
With that, let me particularly thank
the Senator from Florida for his pa-
tience and thank the Presiding Officer
for his patience as well.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida.
AMENDMENT NO. 48
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
I rise today as a voice for the people of
Puerto Rico. I intend to be their voice
in the U.S. Senate. They are Ameri-
cans—as American as the people of
Florida whom I was elected to rep-
resent. They are our brothers and sis-
ters, and they deserve a voice. Their
success is America’s success. Their re-
covery is America’s recovery.
In September of 2017, Puerto Rico
was hit by a devastating hurricane.
Maria’s landfall changed the landscape
of the island forever. As Governor of
Florida, I worked to be there for the
people of Puerto Rico. I worked with
Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonzalez
Colon, Governor Rossello, Lieutenant
Governor Luis Rivera Marin, Senate
President Thomas Rivera Schatz, and
House Speaker Carlos Johnny Mendez
to provide whatever support and aid
they needed.
Jennifer has been a tireless advocate
for Puerto Rico, and she has been fight-
ing so hard for this funding. I am proud
to join her in this fight.
In Florida, we created welcome cen-
ters at the airports in Orlando and in
Miami to support those coming to
Florida from the island. We waived
housing and education regulations to
make sure families coming from Puer-
to Rico could easily settle in Florida,

whether they planned to stay perma-
nently or just for a short period of
time.
I have visited Puerto Rico eight
times since the deadly storm and pro-
vided Florida State resources to the
citizens of Puerto Rico to aid in re-
building and recovery, but the island
still has a long way to go.
The bill I supported today does many
good things. It reopens the government
after the longest shutdown in U.S. his-
tory. It provides significant funding to
secure our southern border—funding
that is long overdue and that is needed
to keep American families safe. It ex-
tends protections for children who were
brought to this country illegally
through no fault of their own, and it
extends TPS. While I would prefer a
permanent solution for the DACA kids
and TPS, this is a positive step. Put-
ting protections for the DACA popu-
lation into law is also long overdue.
The bill also provides significant dis-
aster funding for the State of Florida
following the devastation of Hurricane
Michael, which hit Florida’s Panhandle
just a few months ago. The funding in-
cludes resources specifically for Tyn-
dall Air Force Base. I would like to
thank Majority Leader MCCONNELL for
putting a bill forward to help Florida
recover from this horrible hurricane.
On all of these points, I join many of
my colleagues in support, but, unfortu-
nately, the Senate version of the gov-
ernment funding bill does not include
$600 million in essential disaster fund-
ing for our brothers and sisters in
Puerto Rico.
I am offering an amendment today
that would add the $600 million in-
cluded in the House bill back to the
Senate version.
Puerto Rico’s recovery continues,
and the U.S. Congress must do every-
thing we can to support that, with re-
sponsible safeguards against fraud and
waste. As long as I am a Member of the
U.S. Senate, I will fight to make sure
the people of Puerto Rico are rep-
resented. I am proud that the first
amendment I filed and my first speech
on the Senate floor is to fight for Puer-
to Rico.
To the people of Puerto Rico, know
this: I will be your voice in the Senate.
I will fight for what is right, and I will
never give up.
I will now address the Senate in
Spanish. I provided the translation to
the Senate for the RECORD.
(English translation of the statement
made in Spanish is as follows:)
The people of Puerto Rico deserve real
change. We have to strengthen the economy
of the island. As a Senator, I will fight for
the families of Puerto Rico and work to en-
sure that Puerto Rico is treated fairly.
Thank you so much.
Mr. President, the amendment is at
the desk.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, it has
been 34 days since the President ful-
filled his promise to shut down the gov-
ernment, and the American people are
not happy about it.
Poll after poll shows that people are
not OK with the way the President of
the United States is handling his job,
and it is getting worse by the day, be-
cause to any reasonable person, this
shutdown has been stupid and useless
and cruel.
There are so many failures to talk
about, but I want to talk about four
specific failures that, if it were any
other President, if it were any other
time in modern history, would bring a
President and a Congress to its senses
and end the shutdown.
The first failure is this. Federal
workers are in food lines. Federal
workers are in food lines. People with
jobs are now in food lines. Hundreds of
thousands of people who work for the
government are either furloughed or
working without pay, and, tomorrow,
these American public servants will
miss their second paycheck.
There is a big difference between
missing the first paycheck and the sec-
ond paycheck. Some people can absorb
missing the first paycheck, but this
second paycheck is going to be really,
really challenging for tens of thou-
sands of American public servants be-
cause the rent is due, the mortgage is
due, the car registration is due, the in-
surance is due, and the utilities are due
at the beginning of the month.
This brings the amount of money
that American public servants are
owed by their government for work al-
ready performed to $4.7 billion. Re-
member that about a third of all Fed-
eral workers are veterans.
It may be hard for billionaires in the
Cabinet to understand, but for the mid-
dle class, missing two paychecks in a
row is a total disaster.
I have met people working in airport
security who can’t concentrate. They
can’t sleep because they can’t stop
worrying about how they are going to
pay their bills. I have met government
workers in the midst of applying for
food stamps and asking local charities
for help. I met a single mom who spent
her career working hard to build a life
for her family, and she told me that
without these paychecks, it is all going
backward.
As one Washington Post columnist
put it, under the Republican leader-
ship, the United States is starting to
look like the failed Soviet system,
with middle-class workers literally
waiting in bread lines.
I am grateful that for every story I
have heard of someone suffering, there
is also a story of people stepping up to
help. In Hawaii, in particular, local
utility companies, financial institu-
tions, and others have decided that
they will not penalize Federal workers
hurt by the shutdown if they miss a
payment. I want to thank our local
banks for allowing unpaid Federal
workers to make a late payment on
their mortgage without a penalty, and
I want to thank our credit unions for
extending very cheap credit. I want to
thank people who are organizing in
local communities, not just in Hawaii
but across the country, so that middle-
class families can make it through
this.
Federal workers want paychecks, not
food banks. They want paychecks.
They don’t want charity. They want to
be compensated for the work that they
do. They shouldn’t rely on pop-up
kitchens for furloughed workers or on-
line fundraising campaigns or the kind-
ness of families, friends, and strang-
ers—as great as all of that is. They
should just get paid, and that starts
with opening the government.
Here is the second failure that should
end this shutdown right away, and that
is that economic growth is already
slowing. This week, a White House ad-
viser said that the Nation’s economic
growth could be zero if the shutdown
goes on. Economists and business lead-
ers were already worried about the po-
tential for a recession, and this shut-
down is fanning those unfortunate
flames.
Small businesses can’t get loans.
Companies can’t go public. This admin-
istration has stopped some of the core
functions of our market economy, but
there is one thing that will not stop,
and that is the corruption in this ad-
ministration.
If you have money, this administra-
tion takes care of you, and if you don’t,
then they will not. Federal workers
have been called back to the office to
take care of oil and gas leases—to take
care of oil and gas leases—and to help
financial institutions. They are work-
ing unpaid so that special interests can
keep making money.
This is the third failure. While people
who are fortunate financially are pro-
tected, this shutdown leaves the people
most vulnerable to fend for themselves.
Food pantries and health clinics that
rely on Federal funds are out of sup-
plies, which means that Americans are
going to start to go hungry and with-
out medicine for everything from dia-
betes to addiction.
Landlords who provide housing for 4
million people—mostly seniors and
people with disabilities and kids—will
soon stop receiving rent payments.
They will have to decide how long they
can hold out before being forced to
evict these people or lose the prop-
erties themselves.
Housing authorities are delaying the
release of section 8 vouchers.
Domestic violence shelters that rely
on Federal funds are furloughing their
own workers and cutting back services
that save lives. So men, women, and
children who need to get out of a dan-
gerous situation at home have fewer
options to get to safety.
That brings me to the fourth failure,
which is that public safety is gravely
at risk. This is a serious matter. This
isn’t about whether Donald Trump can
save face or whether the Republicans
can vanquish the Democrats or NANCY

bad. It is none of that. Public safety is
at risk.
Air traffic controllers and TSA work-
ers are working without pay. They are
stressed out, and they are becoming in-
creasingly understaffed and undersup-
ported, and there is no ability to train
new employees, and they are sounding
the alarm.
This isn’t my rhetoric. I want you to
listen to what the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association said yesterday:
We cannot even calculate the level of risk
currently at play, nor predict the point at
which the entire system will break. It is un-
precedented.
The National Transportation Safety
Board is being forced to choose which
crashes to investigate and which not
to, leaving us with unanswered ques-
tions and risking lives in the future. As
of this week, the NTSB has been unable
to investigate 87 crashes, including
some with fatalities.
This is a pattern. It is a pattern of
recklessly endangering the safety of
Americans. We are just 2 months out
from a wildfire that destroyed 18,000
homes and buildings and killed 86 peo-
ple. Yet the shutdown has stopped us
from training firefighters. It has can-
celled controlled burns. It has led to
dead trees piling up in places that we
know pose a fire risk. This is what hap-
pens when you shut down the govern-
ment to try to get your way. You put
real people at risk.
The safety of Americans abroad and
at home is threatened by this shut-
down. The State Department cancelled
a border security summit. This fight is
supposed to be about border security.
Yet we are not paying TSA, we are not
paying FBI agents, we are about to
close some of our Federal courts, and
the State Department itself just can-
celled a border security summit. FBI
agents are working without pay. Field
offices are operating in fiscal uncer-
tainty. That means investigations into
street gangs and drug dealers are on
hold, training on child abductions and
counterterrorism has been cancelled,
and communications with sources
about gangs, such as MS–13, have
stopped. As one agent put it, ‘‘Our en-
emies know they can run freely.’’ Our
enemies know they can run freely.
I ask all of my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle, why would we put
public safety at risk? Why can’t we re-
open the government and negotiate our
differences?
The truth is, as it relates to border
security—I am in my seventh year in
the Senate, and every year, we do a bi-
partisan bill that includes border secu-
rity in the Homeland Security Appro-
priations Subcommittee. We always do
this.
By the way, every Republican and
every Democrat will quietly say: We
are not doing a cement wall from sea
to shining sea. That makes no sense,
and nobody at the Department of
Homeland Security thinks that is a
good idea.
So we quietly appropriate money—
some for personnel, some for beds,
some for courts so they can adjudicate
some of these cases, and some for phys-
ical barriers where it is appropriate, to
put up a wall where it makes sense.
You don’t put up a wall where it
doesn’t make sense. We do this all the
time. So the idea that we are going to
shut down the government and shut
down portions of the Department of
Homeland Security itself in order to
get to a place where the President of
the United States can save face is just
absurd.
We have to be the grownups here, and
that is going to require some Repub-
licans to craft a border security pack-
age with Democrats, as we have over
the last 6 or 7 years, and we have to do
that after we open the government.
The reason that is so essential is that
this President—certainly this Presi-
dent especially, but no President,
Democratic or Republican, now or 30
years from now, should ever inflict
pain on the American people in order
to generate leverage in a policy discus-
sion. When somebody does that—and if
it is one of my friends in the Senate
and they do this 10 years from now, I
want them to read this speech back to
me. The answer to the offer, which is,
‘‘I am going to hurt Americans unless
you do X,’’ should be ‘‘You get nothing
in exchange for not hurting Ameri-
cans.’’ That is not a cookie for us.
Barack Obama learned that lesson
the hard way. Only when he finally
said ‘‘You guys want to screw with the
American economy; you want to mess
with the debt ceiling; you get nothing’’
did they back off, and all that
brinksmanship stopped.
Every time we reward hostage tak-
ing, we will get more hostage taking.
As painful as all of this is, we have to
stand firm. We are absolutely willing
to negotiate a package related to bor-
der security, which will no doubt in-
clude some physical barrier, because
we do that every year, actually, but I
am not doing any of that until the gov-
ernment is opened. That is not just a
political position; that is a matter of
principle because we can’t live like this
as a country. We cannot function like
this. If we do this, if we cut a deal now
and we give $2 billion for the wall, the
debt ceiling is coming up in March or
April, and here we go again. The fiscal
year expires in September, and here we
go again. We will never govern. I know
the Presiding Officer was a Governor.
That is no way to run a country. Let
this be the last shutdown.
I know the two leaders of the Senate
are in what appear to be constructive
conversations. I know there are plenty
of adults who want to get us out of
this. For the first time in several
weeks, I have actually felt somewhat
hopeful about the trajectory. I don’t
think we are going to fix this in the
next hour or so, but at least we are
talking, and at least there seems to be
a desire to structure an off-ramp. But
we have to do one simple thing first:
We have to reopen the government.
People are about to miss their pay-
checks for the second time tomorrow.
It is our obligation to reopen the gov-
ernment.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
VENEZUELA
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wanted
to take a moment to address the recent
events in the nation of Venezuela, but
before I do, I want to take the oppor-
tunity to congratulate the Presiding
Officer, my colleague from the great
State of Florida, who a few moments
ago I believe gave his speech on the
floor of the Senate—and gave part of it
in Spanish, and did it very well—and
spoke about the important issue of
Puerto Rico. His leadership here on
that is going to be critical. It is an
issue I know he knows very well from
his time as Governor of our State.
I know this is another cause he cares
about. He took leadership on it as the
Governor of the State of Florida. As re-
cently as 2 nights ago, he was with me
and some others, and together we met
with the President of the United States
to talk about what is happening in
Venezuela.
The most important answer we have
to have for the American people is,
Why should it matter to us? Why
should America even be involved in
this, beyond expressing an opinion or
sending a letter or even a vote on an
international organism? Why should
America lead, and why should America
be so intricately involved in something
going on in another country?
That is always a valid question. It is
the most important question we have
to consistently answer and not take for
granted. I think we don’t do that
enough anymore in American foreign
policy. It has allowed some to argue
that perhaps the United States gets too
engaged around the world.
We are a nation that should always
stand for our principles, and we should
defend them and stand with those
around the world who share the prin-
ciples of human liberty and dignity and
freedom and respect for human rights.
When the United States gets deeply in-
volved in something in another coun-
try, it must also be in our national in-
terests.
The only reason why being involved
in the issues that are going on in Ven-
ezuela can be justified to the men and
women of this Nation, for whom we
work, is to prove to them and argue to
them and convince them that what is
happening there is not just about Ven-
ezuela, but it is in the national inter-
ests of the United States.
Before I can do that, I have to lay
out the history of what brings us to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S577
January 24, 2019
this point. I will not go into great de-
tail because the time does not permit
it. Venezuela has a Constitution. In
fact, it has a Constitution that was put
in place during the rule of Hugo Cha-
vez—someone whom I was certainly
not a fan of and who was not a fan of
the United States.
Under that Constitution, there was a
parliamentary body of the National As-
sembly, and there was a Presidency
and a supreme court. What happened a
few years ago is that when Chavez died
and Nicolas Maduro—the current dic-
tator of the country—took over, he had
to stand for election. Before he stood
for election, there was an election to
the National Assembly. The party that
was Hugo Chavez’s party and now
Maduro’s party was trounced. They
lost badly. They didn’t just lose the
National Assembly. They lost Gov-
ernors’ seats across the country.
Maduro realized that his party, and
he himself, could not survive in a truly
democratic system. What he did is he
canceled the National Assembly. First,
he started ignoring them. He stopped
following their orders. They would pass
a bill, and he wouldn’t implement it.
He would completely ignore it, as if
they didn’t exist.
Then, he replaced a supreme court
with handpicked people who would do
what he wanted to do. The equivalent
would be if the President of the United
States decided that no matter what
law we passed, even if we overrode a
veto, he just wouldn’t implement it
and would refuse to do it.
Then, at some point, he actually
tried to create an alternative to the
National Assembly. He created, out of
thin air, this thing called the Con-
stituent Assembly, which is an idea he
got from the Cubans and from Com-
munist countries, and gave them ex-
traordinary powers to do all sorts of
things.
One of the things that Constituent
Assembly did is they created an elec-
tion late last spring. People would say
Maduro stood for election, and he
won—theoretically. At least that is
their argument. You can have an elec-
tion and it not be a real election.
For example, every one of the media
outlets in the country is controlled by
the government. All of them have to
run, by law—they are mandated to pro-
vide what they call network coverage
across the board any time he speaks to
the nation.
The opposition party doesn’t have
that same opportunity. He manipu-
lated vote tallies. They were able to go
in and make sure votes were counted in
a certain way. They control votes
through the food program. Forty-two
percent of the people in Venezuela de-
pend on a food program run by the gov-
ernment. To have that food program,
you have to have an identification
card. When you go vote, that same
identification card doesn’t just register
whether you voted or not, they know
whom you voted for. They know whom
you voted for.
If you didn’t show up to vote and you
didn’t vote for whom they wanted you
to vote, meaning Maduro, you got cut
off from your food program. If you had
to choose between voting for someone
you didn’t like or not feeding your
family, you were going to vote for
someone you did not like.
Despite all that, the turnouts were
abysmally low. The images that came
out—there were two people in line, in
some cases. Sometimes they caught
the same five people making the line
over and over again. It wasn’t a real
election.
By the way, he legally disqualified
every credible opponent he could have
possibly had. Because it was a fake
election, the opposition boycotted it.
So he didn’t even have real opposition.
He won this fake election. Then came
January, and he tried to be sworn in.
He was, through a ceremony, but it was
not legitimate. It would be the same as
if the President of the United States
announced that he was calling new
elections, not in 2020; we are going to
have them in April of this year. If he
wins, he will get to serve 6 years in-
stead of 4.
Everybody here would say that is not
the Constitution. It is not a constitu-
tional election. That is what they did.
It is not a reelection. Under the Con-
stitution of Venezuela, because that
was not legitimate, you have a vacancy
in the Office of the Presidency.
Under the Constitution of Venezuela,
similar to ours, when there is a va-
cancy in the Presidency—and by virtue
of that the Vice Presidency because he
was elected alongside—the President of
the country becomes the equivalent of
our Speaker of the House, the same
line of succession we have here. He be-
comes the President of the National
Assembly.
The President of the National Assem-
bly assumes that charge as interim
President and within 45 days has to
call valid constitutional elections.
That is what happened yesterday. The
valid President of the National Assem-
bly called, assumed the responsibility
of interim President, and now within
the next 45 days he will have to sched-
ule and call for elections.
The United States responded to that
by stating the obvious. This is not con-
stitutional. It is not legitimate. We
don’t recognize this fake President. We
recognize your Constitution and the
President whom the Constitution says
is in place, this interim President.
This is not a guy who is trying to be
President himself for 6 years. This is
not a fight between two political par-
ties, not some civil war like we see in
other parts of the world between two
competing bands. This is basically the
person who has been elected, the Presi-
dent of the National Assembly assum-
ing an interim position who is now a
caretaker to guide the country back
toward a constitutional democracy.
The United States recognizes it.
It is stunning to see some of the re-
porting on this here and around the
world; that he basically proclaimed
himself the President. No, he just as-
sumed his constitutional responsi-
bility. The United States did some-
thing unusual in recognizing him. No.
1, it is not unusual. It is the Constitu-
tion of Venezuela; and No. 2, it was not
just the United States.
We were immediately joined by 11
countries in the region. That number is
now up to 16 in the Western Hemi-
sphere—Colombia, Chili, Peru, Brazil,
Argentina, Honduras, Guatemala—all
of them, lined up, and more, and re-
flected the same position the United
States has taken on this issue. So did
France. Apparently, so did the United
Kingdom today and Albania and
Kosovo and a growing number of coun-
tries. Even the European Union says
Maduro is illegitimate. They have not
gone as far as to recognize the interim
President as the interim President, but
they have said he is illegitimate, and
at the National Assembly he is legiti-
mate.
It is not unusual. It happens to be the
global norm. Who disagrees with us
other than Maduro? Cuba, Turkey,
Russia, Iran, Egypt, apparently. What
do they have in common? Think about
it. These are not democracies. They
have their own interests here at heart.
Some might ask: How does this guy
hold on to power if he is so terrible?
No. 1, he controls access to food. I can
tell you, if you control access to food
and medicine and you threaten people
with hunger, you will have a lot of con-
trol. The other thing he has done is, he
uses migration as a relief valve. It is a
very Cuban regime-type tactic.
It is estimated that over 2.3 million
people—basically 1 out of 12 Ven-
ezuelans—have left the country since
2015. Think about that. One-twelfth of
the population has abandoned the
country, leaving behind, in many cases,
children on their own, leaving behind
catastrophe.
The ability to drive out opponents
and people for whom life has become
too miserable is a relief valve. The
other is just sheer oppression. They put
people in jail. They kill people. People
die in custody. They shoot them in the
streets. That is pretty effective, too,
sometimes.
The second thing that keeps them in
power is the assistance of the Cuban re-
gime. Every time I mention that, peo-
ple think: You are just obsessed with
Cuba. You are from Miami, Cuban
American.
The Cubans, when it comes to intel-
ligence and repression, punch way
above their weight. They are experts at
repression. That is what they basically
assist them with.
Do you know the Cubans basically
run the security apparatus of Ven-
ezuela? The personal security of
Maduro are Cubans, which tells you a
lot about how much trust he has in his
countrymen. The Cubans provide them
with basically all of their intelligence
collection and the capacity to collect
intelligence. They have trained their
National Guard on crowd control.

By the way, none of this is free.
These are not free services. This is a
country that is poor and low on re-
sources. The Cubans are probably pull-
ing in $1 billion a year for these serv-
ices they provide.
The other thing people keep men-
tioning that keeps him in power is the
loyalty of military officers. I know you
will see the picture of all these guys in
a country, by the way, where people
are starving, and every single one of
these military guys is overweight.
Somehow, in a starving country, these
people are gaining weight. They have
these fancy uniforms on.
Let me tell you, these folks are not
truly loyal to Maduro. I saw that pic-
ture today. I can tell you for a fact
that more than half of the people in
that picture at some point in time have
expressed serious doubts about Maduro.
They are really limited to what they
can do right now. Why? First of all, be-
cause all of them—every one of them—
is compromised. Their loyalty is not
ideological, and it is not personal. It is
bought. It is paid for. Every single one
of them has access to lucrative corrup-
tion opportunities. Some of them have
been given the opportunity to raid
Venezuela’s national oil company.
They have made millions—hundreds of
millions of dollars—by running that
company into the ground. Some of
them have been given the distribution
of consumer goods—watches and
phones and consumer articles. They
give them these things and say: You
guys go out and sell them in the black
market in the street and take your cut.
Others have been allowed to skim off
that food program I mentioned that
feeds 42 percent of the people. The mili-
tary officers get first dibs at some per-
centage of it, and they get to sell food
directly for a profit. Some are partici-
pating in currency manipulation. It
sounds a lot like an organized crime
ring, like one of these old-style Mafia
families, where one guy ran the loan-
sharking racket and the other guy had
the gambling and the other guy had
the prostitution and the other guy did
the bank heists.
That is what this is. These people are
loyal because Maduro allows them cor-
ruption opportunities. They are also
loyal, by the way, because the Cubans
are spying on them. The Cuban intel-
ligence agencies quickly pick up on
any of these military officers who are
being disloyal or expressing doubts,
and those guys are arrested.
There has been a massive purge of
Venezuelan military officers over the
last 2 years. I am talking about dozens
of high-ranking military officials, ei-
ther removed from their positions or
arrested and are in jail. It wasn’t for
corruption, believe me. It was because
the Cubans caught them and reported
them and were wrapped up. Everybody
else was watching that and saying: It
ain’t going to happen to me.
That is not really loyalty. That is
fear. You can see it in their eyes today.
By the way, they resent the Cubans,
these military officers. Imagine, for a
moment, this is your country, and here
comes the smaller country and their
guys run everything and tell you what
to do and spy on you and pit you
against each other. They better be
careful about expressing that resent-
ment because the Cubans are listening,
and they will report you.
Despite all of this, all is not good in
the Venezuela regime. It has gotten
harder and harder every day. What has
happened with the sanctions that have
been imposed on these individuals,
they have cut off their ability to steal
money and enjoy corruption, and it has
cut off the ability to enjoy the money
they have stolen. They can’t travel.
They can’t buy certain things. They
have to hide their money. Some have
had assets seized here and abroad. That
has created resentment, and that has
created anger within the inner circle.
All these people in the inner circle are
now upset because they are not making
as much money off corruption as they
used to make. They start saying to
themselves, maybe we have to get rid
of Maduro and get a new godfather
Mafia head here. Maduro finds out
about it, and he eliminates them. So
the circle gets smaller, which actually
works to his benefit because with
shrinking resources, the less mouths
you have to feed with corruption, the
better.
There is a real good example of it.
There is a guy named Diosdado
Cabello, who ostensibly is now the
president of this fake constituent as-
sembly. He happens to be a drug lord
deeply involved in narcotrafficking. I
guess that is his part of the corruption
deal. That is his take. That is the busi-
ness line he has been given. But he
wants to be President. He wants to be
President, not Maduro.
This guy Cabello—when Chavez was
removed in a coup that lasted just a
couple of days, Cabello was sworn in as
President of Venezuela because there
was a vacancy, using the exact same
provision of the Constitution that they
now claim is illegitimate. But here is
Cabello, who is a drug dealer, a drug
lord, a thug, but he wants to be Presi-
dent. He will never be elected Presi-
dent of Venezuela in a normal election,
in a legitimate election, so what is his
path to being elected and to becoming
President?
First is this constituent assembly he
has been put in charge of. This new
thing they created outside the Con-
stitution is so powerful that it has the
power to remove Maduro today. They
could remove Maduro. And this guy
hears the whispers. These guys are not
blind to what is happening. They can
see that the country is in disarray, the
economy is collapsing, and there isn’t
enough money for them to steal any-
more, and there are people saying to
him: Hey, why don’t you move on this
guy because this guy is never going to
fix this place.
He is thinking about it, and he has
thought about it, but he knows the
only way he will ever be President is if
he can preserve the outlines of this re-
gime and just get rid of the godfather
and declare himself the new godfather,
the head of this new criminal syn-
dicate, or he can wait until 2024 and
run a rigged election—again, set up
under the confines of this regime. Even
if he doesn’t like Maduro, it is to his
benefit that he stay there until he is
ready to make his move on him or
until 2024, when he can run under this
rigged system.
Another thing that is wrong with
Venezuela is they are deeply in debt.
They have serious problems. These are
the things we think about. They owe
China about $18 billion, which they
don’t have the money to pay. They owe
Russia about $3 or $4 billion. Do you
know how they are paying that right
now? They are paying it with oil. They
are sending oil to China and to Russia
for pennies on the dollar. That is what
they are making because they don’t
have cash, so they are bartering in-
stead, paying the debts off in oil.
I know you have seen the public pro-
nouncements. The Chinese just want to
get paid. They are owed $18 billion, and
they want to get paid, and they want
to make sure that Maduro or whoever
is in power is going to pay them the $18
billion. But the Russians want to get
paid too. Neither one of them believes
Maduro is a great leader or is happy
with him; they just don’t know what is
going to come after him. They are
afraid that whoever comes after him
will state that the debt is not legiti-
mate because it wasn’t approved by the
National Assembly. So they would
rather have this guy in place unless it
is going to be someone else just like
him. But they are not happy.
The corruption in the national oil
company is so horrifying that even the
Chinese and Russians don’t like it.
That is how bad it is. That has to be a
pretty high standard. Then there is the
mismanagement. They have destroyed
this company. Its production has col-
lapsed. It is not run by oil people; it is
run by generals who don’t know any-
thing about the business. They have
run it into the ground, and they missed
payments. Remember, they are sup-
posed to be delivering oil for payment.
They have missed deliveries to the Chi-
nese and Russians. They are not happy
about it, but what are they going to
do? At least they are getting paid
something.
Russia has another interest, by the
way, which leads me now to why we
should care about this.
First and foremost, I can make a
very compelling argument, I believe,
that what is happening in Venezuela is
a national interest threat to the
United States and even potentially a
national security threat.
Let me start with this: Maduro has
repeatedly and openly invited the Rus-
sians to establish both a naval and an
air base in Venezuela. Basically he
said: Here is the land. We will build it
for you. We want to have your air-
planes and naval ships stationed here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S579
January 24, 2019
Most of us serving here, with a few
exceptions, have never served in Con-
gress when—and many people around
do not remember a time—when a for-
eign military, an adversary, was sta-
tioned in our own hemisphere, but that
is what Maduro is inviting him to do.
Why does Maduro want it? Because he
thinks that acts as insurance against
ever having an invasion or whatever he
thinks is going to happen.
Why does Russia want it? They want
it because it is leverage against us.
They don’t like how close we are to
them in Europe with our allies in
NATO, so this gives them an oppor-
tunity to have the equivalence of it in
our own hemisphere.
So if you think Putin having his
military stationed here is a good thing,
then I suppose what is happening in
Venezuela wouldn’t bother you. But
the enormous majority of Americans
don’t want Putin’s military anywhere
in our hemisphere, and that is pre-
cisely what will happen if Maduro re-
mains in power. That alone is a na-
tional security threat to the United
States.
There is more. In their own national
territory, the Maduro regime hosts a
group called the ELN, which is a ter-
rorist narco organization. In fact, last
week the ELN detonated a bomb at the
police academy in Colombia and killed
20 people. Do you know where they are
headquartered? Inside Venezuelan ter-
ritory, and it is from there that they
plot these attacks.
Do you know what else Venezuela
does with the ELN from within Ven-
ezuelan territory? They help them ship
cocaine to the United States of Amer-
ica.
I can state that both of those matters
are national security interests to the
United States. The first is that drugs
are a threat to this country, and any-
one who is helping a drug trafficking
organization ship it into our country is
a threat to us. So if you don’t mind or
don’t care about cocaine being shipped
to the United States in growing quan-
tities, then I guess Maduro and Ven-
ezuela is not something that will both-
er you. But if you do not want to see
people around who are helping drug or-
ganizations ship cocaine into the
United States under the protection of a
government, meaning they are giving
them controlled airspace, and they are
protecting the shipments into the
United States and Europe—if that
troubles you, then Maduro is a prob-
lem.
One of our best partners in fighting
drugs in the hemisphere is Colombia,
but right now, Colombia is over-
whelmed. They don’t have enough
money to dedicate to the anti-drug
cause at a time when cocaine produc-
tion—the growth of coca and the pro-
duction of cocaine, I should say—in Co-
lombia is at historic levels 3 years run-
ning. Where is that cocaine headed? A
lot of it is headed to our streets, and
that will be on top of fentanyl, heroin,
and all the other problems we have. We
are going to have a cocaine crisis in
this country because all that cocaine is
headed here.
Colombia is out there trying to fight
against it, but their resources are
being drained because they have at this
moment at least 1 million or 1.2 mil-
lion Venezuelan migrants who have
had to leave Venezuela and are now in
their territory. If the United States
suddenly absorbed 1 million migrants
over a 12- to 18-month period, we would
struggle to afford what that would en-
tail. Imagine Colombia, whose econ-
omy is a fraction of the size of ours—
that means that instead of spending
money to fight drug cartels to prevent
them from bringing drugs here, they
have had to dedicate resources to the
humanitarian cost of housing over 1
million people, and growing.
It is not just Colombia that is being
compromised. Ecuador has about
170,000 Venezuelan migrants. Peru has
about 250,000 Venezuelan migrants.
These people are not bad. I am not
criticizing the migrants. But these are
not big governments. Some of these
governments have budgets smaller
than most of our States have. They
cannot afford this, and it is threat-
ening to collapse their public health
system, which means we may not have
a humanitarian catastrophe just in
Venezuela; we may soon have a grow-
ing economic catastrophe in Brazil,
Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia—multiple
countries in our hemisphere. And geog-
raphy matters. It would be a terrible
thing if it were happening in Africa or
halfway around the world, but it would
directly impact Americans and our
economy and well-being because of how
close it is to our country, in multiple
ways.
So if you think that having a human-
itarian crisis in multiple countries in
our hemisphere—including countries
aligned with us in the war against
drugs—is a problem, then you should
care about what is happening in Ven-
ezuela.
What is the road forward now? I hope
people have been compelled to at least
understand that this is about more
than just caring about democracy.
That is a big part of it. We do care, and
we are proud of it. But it is a lot more
than just that. This is in the national
interest of the United States. We
should be proud, not just of the bipar-
tisan support in favor of the interim
President and of democracy in Ven-
ezuela, we should be proud of the job
the National Security Council, the
White House, and the State Depart-
ment have done. Unlike 25 or 30 years
ago, this wasn’t some unilateral Amer-
ican action where we went in and told
everybody what to do; this is inter-
national organizations, like the OAS.
Today, the Secretary of State ap-
peared at the OAS personally to argue
the American case, and he was joined
by 15 other countries that voted on a
resolution agreeing with our principles
on this and their principles. The lead-
ership of these countries under the aus-
pices of the Lima Group has been ex-
traordinary. The United States is an
equal partner to them in this endeavor.
What will probably happen now is
that Maduro, instead of being the one
who arrests the interim President, will
turn it over to the courts to let them
decide. Well, he controls the courts.
They are all his cronies. They are also
corrupt, by the way, sanctioned by the
U.S. Government. He could very well
move to try to arrest the interim
President, Juan Guaido, tomorrow or
the next day, although the eyes of the
world are upon him, and the con-
sequences for that would be extraor-
dinary and severe.
They are now saying: Let’s have ne-
gotiations. This is a tactic they have
used repeatedly, and they use it be-
cause they all know we like negotia-
tions. Everybody—anytime there is an
international crisis, why don’t we all
just sit down and negotiate our way
through this? Ideally, that would be
the outcome. But he doesn’t really
want negotiations. He wants a delay
tactic. He has done this multiple times.
There were negotiations from the Vati-
can, and they gave up. Then the former
Prime Minister of Spain was involved
in some of these negotiations. Those
were a total catastrophe. He is just
doing this to bide time. Now he is talk-
ing about Mexico and Uruguay being
the host of the negotiations. I wouldn’t
be surprised if he soon says: Let Russia
come in and be the interlocutory. How
about that for a national security
threat, a national interest threat—hav-
ing Vladimir Putin brokering political
agreements in the Western Hemi-
sphere. Putin would love it. He fancies
himself a great global leader. You are
going to see him do something like
that, all in an effort to bide time. He
has no intention of negotiating any-
thing.
It bides him time to do what? It bides
him time for his fake constituent as-
sembly to change the Constitution to-
wards one-party rule or even poten-
tially to call on new flash elections at
some point for a new national assembly
under this fraudulent election system
he set up. To many people, he will say:
We had an election, and the opposition
lost. But it won’t be a real election if
the people who could win are not al-
lowed to run, are not allowed to adver-
tise, have no access to the media. They
control the ballot box, and they extort
people with access to food.
At some point, I wouldn’t be sur-
prised to see him declare a state of
emergency, maybe go out there and
trigger some fake incident, a false flag,
where agitators go out and commit vio-
lence, and he will say: The protesters
are out of control; declare a state of
emergency. Why would he do that? So
he can paralyze the streets. No one can
be out there protesting. And if the op-
position tries to leave their homes,
now they have a pretext to arrest
them.
There is really only one way forward,
and that is to do everything we can to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S580 January 24, 2019
strengthen the legitimate interim gov-
ernment, and that began today. The in-
terim President’s first request was for
humanitarian aid to help bring food,
medicine, and medical supplies to the
people inside Venezuela.
The Secretary of State of the United
States immediately announced that as
an initial step, we will provide, imme-
diately, $20 million. I know they are
working on how to deliver that into
Venezuela and how they can position
that so the Venezuelan people have ac-
cess to it. This is on top of and apart
from the aid we are already providing
the migrants in Colombia and other
places.
That is a good first step. On day one
on the job, the interim President, Juan
Guaido, made a request of the inter-
national community, and America im-
mediately stepped forward. And I be-
lieve very shortly, in a matter of days,
there will be significant humanitarian
aid—food and medicine—awaiting the
people of Venezuela, either within their
own territory and distributed through
the Red Cross or some other non-
governmental organization or just
across the border, where they can ac-
cess it.
We have to continue to make clear to
the elites in that country that there is
no future for Maduro, that there is no
way he can hold on, and that they need
to begin thinking about who their loy-
alties should be to—the Constitution
they swore an allegiance to, the people
they live among, or some guy whose fu-
ture is about to come to an end.
I think it is important that the Na-
tional Guard know that not only
should they not repress the people but
that they will be held accountable if
they do. Ultimately, I believe this
deeply. I know the generals and all the
guys at the press conference in the
fancy uniforms have sworn allegiance—
you know how nervous they were—but
I can state that the rank-and-file fight-
ers did not. Do you know why? Because
the rank-and-file soldier and the mid-
level officer in the military don’t have
corruption deals; they are going just as
hungry as everybody else. They have
massive rates of desertion, people just
abandoning posts.
When you saw the images yesterday
of the hundreds of thousands of people
in the streets, you know that many of
those soldiers have mothers, fathers,
sisters, brothers, and loved ones, wives,
and children in that crowd. Do you
know who else knows that? The mili-
tary brass. I know for a fact that they
have significant doubts. In fact, they
probably do not even believe that if
they ordered the military to act
against their own people, the military
would, because there is no way these
rank-and-file soldiers are going to
shoot on their brothers and sisters and
mothers and fathers and other loved
ones.
So we need to step forward and con-
tinue with the humanitarian aid. We
need to help use the leadership of the
United States to put together recon-
struction aid.
We need to help the interim Presi-
dent with whatever he needs to carry
out a legitimate free and fair and inter-
nationally supervised election, which
he should call for in the next 45 days.
This is the path forward. It is in our
national interest. It is the right thing
to do. It reflects our values, but it also
reflects our interests as a nation. That
is why this matters. That is why we
should care. This is not halfway around
the world. This is in our own hemi-
sphere. It is just a few hours’ flight
away, and it impacts more than just
one country. It impacts an entire hemi-
sphere.
I will close with this. There has been
a lot of criticism historically over the
U.S. role in the Western Hemisphere.
During the Cold War, the criticism was
that we were supporting rightwing dic-
tators, fighting off communism, but we
were involved in some coups, and we
had a heavy hand and got in and im-
posed ourselves. Then we went the
total opposite way, and for many
years—in fact, up until recently, no
one talked about the Western Hemi-
sphere, and to the extent we did, it was
about migration and drugs. It was al-
most, frankly, a complete abandon-
ment of the portfolio.
What you are seeing now is the po-
tential birth of a new Latin America—
a new Western Hemisphere, one in
which the United States is an impor-
tant partner but not a unilateral actor.
When you see 16 countries in this hemi-
sphere come together in an economic
and diplomatic way, from Peru to
Chile, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil,
when you see the OAS come alive after
years of—frankly, when is the last time
any of us here discussed anything of
the things happening at the OAS? You
start to see the beginning of not just a
way to confront the crisis in Venezuela
but of a hemispheric partnership whose
impetus may have been this crisis but
creates a path forward that is in our
national interest. Imagine if, in fact,
democracies and free people of this re-
gion came together not just to tackle
dictatorships but to tackle drugs, to
tackle the root cause of migration.
Imagine a hemispheric 16-, 18-regional-
nation response to what is happening
in El Salvador and Honduras and Gua-
temala to cause these people to under-
take this dangerous journey with their
children, in many cases; imagine if it
wasn’t just the United States but us
working in partnership with all these
other countries to tackle these hemi-
spheric challenges. I will tell you, that
is in our national interest.
Not only is this an opportunity to do
the right thing in Venezuela, it is an
opportunity to give a start to a new
hemispheric reality, a new Latin Amer-
ican reality that serves the national
interest in this country and allows us
to live in a hemisphere that is free and
prosperous, where people do not have
to abandon their homelands, where
people can stay in their countries, if
they so choose, and raise their families
and not have to undertake dangerous
journeys to other countries for fear of
their lives.
We have to start somewhere. I can
think of no better place to start than
on behalf of the people of Venezuela
who have suffered terribly for far too
long under a dictatorial, corrupt re-
gime that tortured their children and
murdered their fathers and mothers
and denied a once-prosperous country
the future they deserve.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I
come to the floor to implore my col-
leagues and the President to end the
shutdown and reopen the Federal Gov-
ernment.
We are now on day 34 of this shut-
down, which is well past being the
longest in American history. When you
think about what our country has been
through: the Civil War, World War I,
World War II; you think about the pro-
tests we had; what we had with the
country in the Depression; what we had
only a decade ago with the biggest
downturn since the Depression—
through all of that, even through a few
shutdowns, we somehow, in this Cham-
ber and in the House and in the White
House, were able to get our act to-
gether and were somehow able to keep
the government open.
Now is the time to open the govern-
ment, Mr. President. The 800,000 Fed-
eral employees who are not being paid
are keenly aware that this is the long-
est shutdown on record. Another sad
milestone is coming if the shutdown
continues through tomorrow. These
workers will miss yet another pay-
check. These are workers, like a Fed-
eral prison worker in Rochester, MN,
who noted to me that the inmates were
getting paid but the prison workers are
not. She was so excited to get this job
a few months ago. Her child was in
daycare. She is a single mom, and now
she has to decide between taking some
other job and moonlighting. What does
she do about the daycare if she takes
another job and takes her child out of
daycare and stays home with her child,
which would make some sense, except
she wouldn’t have enough money, and
then she would lose her spot in the
daycare. It is very hard to get daycare
in Minnesota.
Instead of working on those kinds of
what I would call opportunities, at a
time when our economy has been sta-
ble after we had gotten out of the
downturn, we have been working out of
chaos. Instead of helping her to afford
childcare and figuring out smart solu-
tions, or doing something about phar-
maceutical prices, or doing something
about college costs, or training our
workers for the jobs of today and to-
morrow, or enacting comprehensive
immigration reform so our rural areas
in my State, where we don’t have
enough workers on our farms and in
our fields and in our factories—we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S581
January 24, 2019
should be working on those oppor-
tunity issues—instead, we are trying to
crawl out of chaos.
We need to reopen the government
and get these workers back on the jobs
providing vital services for the Amer-
ican people. Once it is open, as my col-
leagues have made clear and as leader-
ship has made clear, we can continue
negotiations with the President about
border security. I am someone, as is
my colleague from Pennsylvania, who
voted for a bill that had over $40 billion
in border security that was part of
comprehensive immigration reform.
We did this, but was it a wall through
the entire border? No, it was not. It al-
lowed the experts to decide where there
should be technology, where there
should be fencing, where there should
be barriers, where there should be per-
sonnel. That is the way to do this.
There is no reason our Federal work-
ers and the American taxpayers who
rely on the vital services provided by
the Federal workers should be held
hostage while these policy negotiations
take place. The pain that this shut-
down is causing is real, and it is get-
ting worse.
The administration has implemented
many creative measures to try to blunt
the public outcry against the shut-
down, but these measures are being
held together by duct tape. We use duct
tape a lot in Minnesota. We try to put
things together, but we shouldn’t be
using duct tape to tape together our
entire government.
Our Agencies are running out of
money, and many are reaching the
breaking point. Earlier today, the five
former Secretaries for the Department
of Homeland Security, including our
first DHS Secretary, Tom Ridge, and
John Kelly, President Trump’s former
Chief of Staff, wrote a letter urging an
end to this shutdown and full funding
for the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity. In their letter, the former Secre-
taries noted that Congress always
prioritizes funding of the Defense De-
partment as a matter of national secu-
rity.
Congress does so because putting national
security at risk is an option we simply can’t
afford. DHS should be no different.
The administration continues to ex-
plore ideas like a national emergency
declaration to bypass Congress. The ir-
responsibility of all of this is breath-
taking. Yesterday, the presidents of
the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association, the Air Line Pilots Asso-
ciation, and the Association of Flight
Attendants released a terrifying joint
statement pointing out the risk the
shutdown presents to air travel:
In our risk-averse industry—That is put-
ting it mildly—
we cannot even calculate the level of risk
currently at play, nor predict the point
where the entire system will break. It is un-
precedented.
I have talked to the air traffic con-
trollers in my State. I have talked to
the TSA workers who sit there every
day and do their job without pay. In
this letter, they go on to state that the
‘‘air safety environment . . . is deterio-
rating by the day.’’
Reading this statement does not give
me confidence, nor does the fact that a
full 10 percent of our Transportation
Security Administration agents are
now missing work because of financial
limitations—meaning they can’t cover
the daycare and transportation ex-
penses required to come to work. Those
who can come to work are surely dis-
tracted by worries about how they will
pay their bills.
As a member of the Senate Com-
merce Committee, I worked with my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle
last year to reauthorize the Federal
Aviation Administration. We were
rightly proud of the law, including the
third title, simply titled, ‘‘Safety,’’
which had 90 individual provisions de-
signed to maximize the safety of air
travel for the American people. We re-
quired updated safety training proce-
dures for airline professionals, sought
to improve safety on our Nation’s run-
ways and in rural areas, and updated
the laws regarding engine safety. This
matters a lot in my State. We are a
major hub in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
area. We are the State that manufac-
tures jets up in Duluth at Cirrus. We
are the State that has major Min-
nesota National Guard facilities that
train flight inspectors and aviators and
people all over the country. Aviation is
incredibly important in my State.
In our bill, we required updated safe-
ty training procedures for airline pro-
fessionals, sought to improve safety in
our Nation’s runways and rural areas.
As the Senator from Pennsylvania and
Florida know, rural air service in our
States are key, and we updated those
laws.
We are hearing the entire system of
air travel may break, and for what?
What does air travel have to do with
border security? The short answer is,
air travel has nothing to do with bor-
der security, except when we are
checking our airports and making sure
they are safe when there are border
flights. If we are talking about a wall
across the southern border, that has
nothing to do with our airports in Min-
nesota and in Pennsylvania and in
Florida. I have long favored increasing
our border security through smart
technology.
As I mentioned, our 2013 immigration
bill, which passed this Chamber with a
number of Republican votes—many of
whom are still here—included money
for an additional 40,000 Border Patrol
agents. As we know, most drugs come
into this country through our ports of
entry. If we want to do something
about the various problems with the
drugs coming into our country, things
like heroin from Central America and
from Mexico and things like other
opioids, then we should be doing some-
thing about those ports of entry.
As has been the case all along, there
are proposals on the table that will re-
open the government and end this
senseless shutdown. The House has now
passed legislation that will fund the
government under any number of ar-
rangements. It includes bills that fund
all remaining government Agencies
through the end of the fiscal year—
bills that fund individual Departments
and Agencies, most having absolutely
nothing to do with this debate that is
raging in the White House.
The last bill that was passed through
February 8, a short-term basis that
would have taken us through February
8, would have allowed the President
and Congress to negotiate a longer
term proposal. That was the bill we
passed in the Senate. This last bill was
even coupled with additional funding
for disaster relief—a priority for both
parties that wish to help Americans in
States that have suffered through hur-
ricanes and wildfires.
Earlier this afternoon, the Senate
voted on the short-term funding pro-
posal. While the proposal did not gain
the required 60 votes to gain consider-
ation, I was encouraged by the fact
that 5 Republican Senators joined
Democrats in voting to consider this
bill. This is progress, and we need to
build on that momentum by working
together to do the right thing for the
American people.
On Monday, we celebrated Martin
Luther King’s life. One of the things
Martin Luther King once said was that
‘‘the time is always right to do what is
right.’’ This is the right time. We can’t
just keep waiting while government
Agencies remain shuttered. There are
6,100 Federal workers in the State of
Minnesota who are not receiving their
paychecks. Farmers, small business
owners, and taxpayers are going with-
out vital services from their govern-
ment, major portions of which have
been closed for 34 days. It is time to re-
open the government.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to
talk about the shutdown, as my col-
league, the senior Senator from Min-
nesota, just did. I am grateful for her
comments on what is happening to peo-
ple in Minnesota, the direct adverse
impact of this shutdown on their lives.
We have all seen it. We have all experi-
enced it.
I will be referring to specific testi-
mony from people who wrote me let-
ters, but let me just highlight one ex-
perience I had the other day at a food
bank in Central Pennsylvania, just
miles from our State capital—a food
bank that serves 27 of our 67 counties.
I was talking about how this shut-
down could end. The President wanted
the shutdown. He got the shutdown,
but he could also end it. Prior to the
discussion we had, behind us, they had
an entire table full of food items that
the food bank and others in that region
of Pennsylvania were delivering to
Federal workers, especially to TSA
agents, who cannot afford food because
they are working but are not being

paid. It is hard to comprehend that. It
is hard to comprehend that so many
veterans around the country are, once
again, serving their country by serving
in the government as they served in
combat or in the military; yet they are
being left out in the cold, so to speak—
sometimes literally—but are, obvi-
ously, being left out when they don’t
have paychecks.
So this is real life. We debate bills
and budgets and appropriations here in
Washington. We have debates on the
floor and debates and discussions in the
hallways, but for these folks, this is
real life. I will just point to, maybe,
five examples in Pennsylvania.
Adams County, which is in the south-
ernmost part of our State, where Get-
tysburg is—just on the Maryland bor-
der—is not a big county by population.
Here is what one individual who is
married to a Federal worker wrote. I
will just quote her in part.
She writes:
We are expecting our first child this sum-
mer and, prior to December 22, were excited
about the future and potential of 2019. Now
we are anxious, sad, and angry, not knowing
where the money will come from to buy ne-
cessities for this child, let alone medical ex-
penses related to birth and daycare.
She goes on to write later in the let-
ter:
We are now in real and serious danger of
losing our home and our vehicles. We will
soon have to choose between buying gro-
ceries or paying for the electric bill.
She goes on from there. She is one
Pennsylvanian in Adams County.
Here is one from Cambria County,
which is in the southwestern part of
our State.
This individual wrote: ‘‘My husband
is a Federal employee who has been
furloughed.’’
She goes on to write:
We have a son in elementary school. It is
about time for spring sports sign-ups, but we
don’t know how we are going to pay our bills
or buy groceries. It is our son’s birthday in
less than 2 weeks. We canceled his birthday
party to save some money.
That was from Cambria County, PA.
The third one I will highlight is from
Delaware County, which is one of the
big, suburban Philadelphia counties. It
is a big population county.
Here is, in part, what this individual
wrote: ‘‘My in-laws are selling their
home and cannot go to settlement be-
cause the FHA will not close a mort-
gage for the buyer.’’
That was among several things they
wrote in the letter. In the interest of
time, I will not read all of it, but we
hear these stories all the time of people
not being able to complete the work on
a mortgage because of the impact on
the FHA.
Here is one from Montgomery Coun-
ty, which is also a suburban Philadel-
phia county.
This individual wrote:
I am a law enforcement park ranger for the
National Park Service. . . . I am the sole
provider for a family of four, to include two
young children. Not knowing when I will get
paid again is putting undue stress on the en-
tire family.
That word ‘‘stress’’ keeps coming up
either directly in these letters or by
implication. Over and over again, we
hear of the stress this shutdown is put-
ting on families across America.
The last one I will highlight is from
Warren County, which is in the north-
western corner of our State. It is a
much smaller population county than
were the two suburban Philadelphia
counties I just mentioned of Mont-
gomery and Delaware.
Here is what this individual wrote
from Warren County:
Both my wife and I are federal employees
working for the U.S. Forest Service. We are
also both veterans. We will be using our sav-
ings to live off of and charging food to our
credit cards if we must.
It goes on and on, and I know the
Presiding Officer has seen the same
thing. We have all seen and heard much
about this. There is not enough time
tonight to go through every letter.
This is what has to be the priority of
all of ours. We have to be responsive to
these cries for help, to be responsive to
Americans who are just asking us to
open the government so they can be
paid, so they can make ends meet, so
they can pay for groceries, so they can
pay their mortgages—or to even have a
mortgage in some cases—so they can
pay for basic necessities, and so they
can sometimes even just pay for birth-
day parties for their sons. Over and
over again, we hear these stories.
As my colleague from Minnesota
made reference to, I was encouraged
that, today, we had two votes. There
was a likely expectation prior to the
votes that they wouldn’t get enough to
pass, but at least we were voting. At
least we were voting on one measure
that one side favored and were voting
on another measure that my side of the
aisle favored. I was also encouraged
that five Republicans voted for the
Democratic proposal, which is very
simple—to fund the government, to
open the government, and add disaster
assistance for emergencies from nat-
ural disasters. The lives of people are
adversely affected by so many natural
disasters, but this is also, of course, an
emergency—funding the government so
as to make sure that workers have
their pay and to make sure people are
served by important programs like the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program. Of course, we could make a
long list of programs that are impor-
tant to people’s lives.
In the case of the so-called SNAP
program—what we used to call food
stamps—you are talking basically
about children, seniors, and people
with disabilities. These are most of the
people who get benefits from the SNAP
program. They are only guaranteed
help from that program through Feb-
ruary. There is no certainty about
March. There is no certainty about
April or the forthcoming months. It is
just one program that serves millions
of Americans that has already been ad-
versely impacted because of the shut-
down.
Whether you are talking about a
mom or a dad who is a Federal em-
ployee or whether you are talking
about someone who needs the help of
the Federal Government—people who
we have said over many generations de-
serve that help—in either case, it is un-
acceptable to them, and it should be
unacceptable to us to not have the gov-
ernment open. We have lots of time to
debate many issues after that, but pri-
ority No. 1 has to be to open the gov-
ernment. Then we will have a lot of
time for debate on a range of issues.
REMEMBERING HARRIS WOFFORD
Mr. President, I conclude tonight
with some brief remarks. We are going
to have several occasions to amplify
these remarks in the coming days re-
garding the passing of Senator Harris
Wofford, the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania from 1991 to the early days of
1995. I just want to offer some personal
remarks. In a short timeframe, it is
very difficult to encapsulate the life of
any individual, obviously, but in this
case, it is impossible in a few short
minutes to encapsulate the life, the
contributions, and the achievements of
Senator Harris Wofford, so I will just
highlight a few. If you were to just
read his resume, you would think you
were reading the life story of the
achievements of several people instead
of just one.
To give you some highlights, he was
an early advocate for civil rights. He
was someone who stuck his neck out to
march with Dr. King, his good friend,
and to advocate on behalf of the Civil
Rights Act of 1957.
He then worked for President Ken-
nedy as a special assistant for civil
rights and prepared the way for the
great breakthroughs of the midsixties,
of the civil rights legislation of the six-
ties. He worked with Sargent Shriver
and others in the Kennedy administra-
tion in the formation of the Peace
Corps, and he served in that capacity
overseas.
As I mentioned, he was a good friend
of Dr. Martin Luther King’s and par-
ticipated in the Selma to Montgomery
civil rights marches in 1965 in support
of voting rights for African Americans.
He was the President of two different
colleges—one in Pennsylvania, Bryn
Mawr, which is a great college. It is
one of the best in the country.
I got to know Harris Wofford before
he was Senator Wofford. It was when
he worked for the new Casey adminis-
tration, when my father was elected
Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986. He
put together a cabinet in the early part
of 1987, and he appointed Harris as the
Secretary of Labor and Industry—one
of the big departments in State govern-
ment.
It was from that position that he was
chosen to be a U.S. Senator. It was
after the tragic and untimely death of
Senator John Heinz, who passed away
in April of 1991. Harris was named that
next month. He was elected in 1991 to
complete that term and then lost his
reelection in 1994, but Harris was not
done with service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S583
January 24, 2019
After serving in the Kennedy admin-
istration and in the Senate—after
doing such great work on education
and civil rights in the interest of jus-
tice—he continued his work. He worked
very hard to make sure that the Mar-
tin Luther King holiday was not just a
holiday but a day of service. So he and
others came together in the
midnineties—after Harris was out of of-
fice and after he had left the Senate—
to make sure that day would be a day
of service. Now, all of these years
later—more than 20 years later—hun-
dreds of thousands of people across the
country perform acts of service, engage
in service, on that day.
We will spend more time highlighting
his life here on the Senate floor and in
other places around the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania and, I am sure,
across the country, but let me just con-
clude with these words: Harris Wofford
was a champion for justice. In the
Scriptures, they tell us that those who
pursue justice should be blessed.
Blessed are they who will hunger and
thirst for justice for they shall be sat-
isfied.
Harris Wofford was never satisfied
when it came to justice. He was always
trying to march us forward. He was al-
ways urging us to do more in the inter-
est of justice, in the interest of civil
rights, and of equal rights. He was a
champion for justice. That is probably
an understatement. He was also a per-
son of uncommon courage to stand up
as he did on civil rights when it was
not easy—when, at times, it was lit-
erally dangerous.
In addition to his courage, he was a
person of integrity and decency. He al-
ways wanted to know what others were
doing, what other’s lives were like,
what they hoped for our country. He
was always curious about other peo-
ple’s lives and what he could learn
from them.
To say that he lived a life of service
is, again, an understatement. I don’t
know of anyone who served in so many
different capacities, whether it was in
the Army Air Corps in World War II,
whether it was in leading the way on
civil rights for President Kennedy, or
whether it was here in the Senate in
his helping to create opportunities for
service. He not only lived that life of
service, but he challenged all of us.
Whether we were public officials or
citizens, he challenged us to serve. He
lived the words of Dr. King, the words
of service. Dr. King said that everyone
can be great because everyone can
serve. Harris Wofford was great for lots
of reasons, but he was also great, of
course, because he served.
We will have more opportunities to
amplify this small measure of com-
mendation to Harris Wofford, but on a
night like tonight, we are thinking of
him. We are inspired by him, and we
are grateful for his service and for that
of his family’s.
I had a chance to talk to his son Dan,
who has been a friend of mine for a
long time, just hours before his father
passed away. I was honored to talk to
him in those difficult hours.
Mr. President, in remembering Harris
Wofford, as we will do more formally in
the next number of days, I want to
thank him for his service to the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania and for his
service to America.
With that, I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
TRIBUTE TO THE SENATE PAGES
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today is
the last day for the Senate pages who
are here with us today. This is a little
known fact—I didn’t even realize this
until it was presented to me—but the
115th Congress, which we just con-
cluded, had more session days than any
Congress since 1951. That goes to tell
you that these pages worked incredibly
hard, and we are grateful. We hope
their experience here was rewarding.
They should know that there are sev-
eral Members here serving on this side
who once sat there.
I shouldn’t be here by the time the
pages get here, I hope, but we look for-
ward to their service to our country in
the years to come in whatever they de-
cide to do.
Thank you for all of your work.
We truly appreciate the time they
have put in.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that their names be printed in the
RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
Abby Solomon, Eve Downing, Sophia

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO LAINY LEBOW-SACHS
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor Lainy LeBow-Sachs, a
Baltimore icon whose name has rightly
become synonymous with public serv-
ice and philanthropy. After 23 years at
the Kennedy Krieger Institute and 16
years before that as one of then-Gov-
ernor William Donald Schaefer’s key
special assistants, Lainy has an-
nounced she is retiring. My wife Myrna
and I are proud to have Lainy as one of
our dearest friends and closest advis-
ers. So today, I would like to pause to
reflect on the remarkable legacy she
has created.
Lainy was born in Newton, MA, but
moved to Baltimore in 1970, where she
spotted a flyer for someone who was
running to be the city’s next mayor.
Intrigued and looking for a way to en-
gage in the community, she began vol-
unteering on the campaign. The can-
didate in question was William Donald
Schaefer, who, with Lainy’s help and
knack for connecting with people, went
on to win that election and several oth-
ers after it until becoming the Gov-
ernor of Maryland in 1987. Lainy was by
his side throughout it all, serving as
one of his closest advisers and con-
fidants. She became known around
Maryland for her strength of character,
work ethic, and uncanny ability to fa-
cilitate meaningful connections be-
tween State and local officials with
shared goals and ideas for making
Maryland a better place in which to
live and work.
After Governor Schaefer’s retire-
ment, Lainy’s talents were widely
sought-after. She was approached regu-
larly by public officials, businesses,
and nonprofits, all of them eager to
have one of Maryland’s most influen-
tial and effective public servants on
their team. None of the opportunities
resonated, until she was approached by
Dr. Gary Goldstein, the president and
chief executive officer of the Kennedy
Krieger Institute. For those outside of
Maryland who may be unfamiliar with
Kennedy Krieger, the institute is, as
its website states, ‘‘an internationally
recognized institution dedicated to im-
proving the lives of children and young
adults with pediatric developmental
disabilities and disorders of the brain,
spinal cord and musculoskeletal sys-
tem, through patient care, special edu-
cation, research, and professional
training.’’
The chance to work on behalf of chil-
dren with developmental disabilities,
to raise their profile, to put their needs
and care in the spotlight and devote
her time to something so worthwhile

with her famous Rolodexes full of con-
tacts and friends from across the State,
made her an indomitable force of good
will. Kennedy Krieger’s fundraising
skyrocketed under her leadership, as
did the institute’s profile, allowing it
to invest in groundbreaking medical
research and, above all, to care for
more children. Over the course of her
tenure, she led three capital projects
that raised a combined total of more
than $117 million, all in the name of
improving and expanding healthcare
for our children and grandchildren. She
built the institute’s new external rela-
tions department from the ground up;
it started with only her; today, it em-
ploys a staff of 34 like-minded philan-
thropists dedicated to keeping Kennedy
Krieger growing. Dr. Goldstein, the
man who convinced Lainy to join Ken-
nedy Krieger, says it best: ‘‘She has
been phenomenally successful. We are
quiet, nerdy academics around here.
She took us up a step by a factor of
ten.’’
Lainy has been so successful
throughout her career both because she
works hard and because her compas-
sion and empathy shine through in all
that she does. When she asks someone
for help or for resources, it is always
clear that the ‘‘ask’’ comes from a
place of deep, heartfelt sincerity. When
she uses her influence to connect peo-
ple, it is because she genuinely believes
in them and in the work they are try-
ing to do. Everyone has always under-
stood Lainy to be extraordinarily
thoughtful, earnest, effective, and em-
pathetic, and that character has in-
spired immediate trust from everyone
she meets. That trust has been her cur-
rency, and she has spent it on helping
others.
What makes Lainy so remarkable
isn’t just that she is so talented; many
people are. Rather, it is that she has
always used her talents to improve
other people’s lives. In his book ‘‘Wish-
ful Thinking,’’ Frederick Buechner
wrote, ‘‘The place God calls you to is
the place where your deep gladness and
the world’s deep hunger meet.’’ From
the day Lainy first arrived in Balti-
more nearly 50 years ago, she has found
that place in her life, and all of our
lives have been enriched.
When I say that Lainy is retiring, I
need to add some caveats. She cur-
rently serves on the boards of Beth Am
Synagogue, the Associated: Jewish
Community Federation of Baltimore,
the Baltimore Jewish Council, the
BB&T advisory board, and the Balti-
more Symphony Orchestra. Serving for
Lainy comes as naturally and, appar-
ently, as necessarily as breathing.
Lainy has come to define the best of
Maryland, and her legacy is now and
forever woven into our State’s history.
She has channeled her considerable
skills and connections into work that
has changed lives and facilitated in-
credible progress in caring for some of
our most vulnerable children. On be-
half of those children, their families,
and the entire State of Maryland, I ex-
tend to her my sincere and eternal
gratitude.∑

TRIBUTE TO VERNON ODOM
∑ MR. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to
commend Vernon Odom, a highly re-
garded television news anchor for
6ABC—WPVI—in Philadelphia. Vernon
Odom retired in December 2018 after
more than 40 years of bringing break-
ing news into the living rooms of
Philadelphia area residents.
Odom was born in Atlanta, GA, and
grew up in Akron, OH. His father,
Vernon Odom, Sr., was a social worker
and his mother, Sadie Harvey Odom, a
scientist. Odom was raised with a pas-
sion for journalism, as his maternal
grandfather was the second African
American to publish a daily newspaper.
Odom’s great-grandfather, B.T. Harvey,
Sr., launched the Nation’s second Afri-
can-American-owned newspaper, the
‘‘Columbus Messenger.’’ Odom’s sister,
Maida, is also a journalist and served
as a veteran reporter for the Philadel-
phia Inquirer.
After graduating from Morehouse
College in Atlanta, GA, Odom began
his reporting career with the civil
rights movement, including the assas-
sination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Odom completed his postgraduate stud-
ies in broadcast journalism at Colum-
bia University in New York.
Since his arrival in Philadelphia, co-
inciding with the celebration of Amer-
ica’s Bicentennial, Odom has covered
some of the biggest stories of a genera-
tion and neighborhood milestones
throughout every section of Philadel-
phia and the suburbs.
Odom also had the opportunity to
travel the globe, bringing news stories
from Latin America, the Middle East,
and Europe to Philadelphia area resi-
dents. Notably, Vernon Odom covered
the release of Nelson Mandela from
prison as well as the first free election
in South Africa in 1994. More recently,
he was live as Pope Francis visited
Philadelphia for the 2015 World Meet-
ing of Families, as well as for the 2016
Democratic National Convention.
Odom is passionate about politics
and he memorably reported live from
the Ballroom of the Lackawanna Hil-
ton in downtown Scranton when my fa-
ther, Bob Casey, Sr., was elected Gov-
ernor of Pennsylvania in November
1986.
In 2004, Odom was inducted into the
Philadelphia Broadcast Pioneers Hall
of Fame and, in 2018, was honored as
the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia
Person of the Year.
I wish to express gratitude to Vernon
Odom for more than four decades of
dedication to broadcast journalism and
to 6ABC. I wish him well in his retire-
ment.∑

TRIBUTE TO DR. EDMUND O.
SCHWEITZER III
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along
with my colleagues Senator JAMES E.
RISCH, Representative MIKE SIMPSON,
and Representative RUSS FULCHER, I
congratulate Edmund O. Schweitzer
III, Ph.D., on his induction into the Na-
tional Inventors Hall of Fame.
The National Inventors Hall of Fame
selected Dr. Schweitzer for this honor
in recognition of him bringing ‘‘the
first microprocessor-based digital pro-
tective relay to market, revolution-
izing the performance of electric power
systems with computer-based protec-
tion and control equipment, and mak-
ing a major impact in the electric
power utility industry.’’ Dr. Schweitzer
has received many recognitions for his
contributions to the development of
digital protection and electric power
systems worldwide. He is an Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engi-
neers, IEEE, Fellow, who was honored
with IEEE’s Medal in Power Engineer-
ing in 2012. In 1982, he founded Schweit-
zer Engineering Laboratories, Inc.,
SEL, to develop and manufacture dig-
ital protective relays and related prod-
ucts and services.
Characterizing Dr. Schweitzer as cre-
ative and inventive is an understate-
ment. This month, he will receive his
200th patent pertaining to electric
power system protection, metering,
monitoring, and control. He turns his
ideas into practical tools that meet the
demands of our ever-changing and mod-
ernizing society. By protecting power
grids, the technology he has developed
and disseminated is helping to ensure
that Americans and people around the
world can access needed safe, more re-
liable, and more economical electric
power to live and fuel growth.
Congratulations, Dr. Schweitzer, on
this recognition, and thank you for
lending your talents, ideas and know-
how to furthering our communities and
Nation.∑

REMEMBERING J. HAROLD
SHEPHERD
∑ Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor an incredible man and an
incredible Georgian. J. Harold Shep-
herd passed away earlier this month,
but his legacy will far outlast his time
on earth. If you have spent time in
Georgia or anywhere in the Southeast
you may have heard of his family’s
work at the Shepherd Center. The
Shepherd Center, located in Atlanta,
Georgia, is one of the top rehabilita-
tion hospitals in the country and the
result of Harold’s lifetime of passion
for others and the disabled community.
A fourth generation Atlantan, Harold
was the youngest of six children. He
started in construction with his father
at age 15, and as a young man started
Shepherd Construction Company with
his three brothers. Harold and his fam-
ily members oversaw the construction
of thousands of miles of interstate
highways and city and country streets,
and built all but one section of I–95 in
Georgia.
Harold’s proudest achievement, how-
ever, was the Shepherd Center. The

hospital was founded after James, Har-
old, and his wife Alana’s son, sustained
a serious spinal cord injury on a beach
trip. James spent six months at a reha-
bilitation hospital in Colorado, where
he ultimately regained his ability to
walk. When James returned home to
Atlanta, he and his parents grew frus-
trated with the lack of rehabilitation
care options in the Southeast and de-
veloped a plan to open the Shepherd
Center.
What started as a six-bed rehabilita-
tion unit is now a world-renowned, 152–
bed research and rehabilitation facility
spread across three campuses. Until his
passing earlier this month, Harold
spent nearly every day volunteering at
the hospital and developed a reputation
for being an incredible storyteller and
historian. He was beloved by the staff
at the Shepherd Center, and dedicated
his life to them, his family, and the
disabled community in Georgia.
Harold is survived by his wife, Alana
Smith Shepherd; his sons James H.
Shepherd, Jr. and Thomas C. Shepherd;
and his grandchildren Julie Shepherd,
James H. Shepherd III (Sarah), and
Thomas C. Shepherd, Jr. He is also sur-
vived by four great grandchildren,
James Harold Shepherd IV, Josephine
Shepherd, Virginia Shepherd, and
Annie Shepherd.
Mr. Shepherd will be greatly missed,
and I thank him for his service to our
community.∑

RECOGNIZING BAILEY’S GENERAL
STORE
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I
wish to highlight the hard work and
unique entrepreneurial spirit found in
small businesses across my home State
of Florida. Each week I recognize a
small business that exemplifies perse-
verance and dedication to the local
community. Today, as chairman of the
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, it is my distinct pleas-
ure to name Bailey’s General Store in
Sanibel, FL, as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week.
Bailey’s General Store has a long his-
tory of providing essential goods to the
people of Sanibel Island. Founded in
1899 by Frank P. Bailey, the Sanibel
Packing Company provided groceries
and other general supplies to both
locals and visitors before there was a
bridge to the island. Three generations
of the Bailey family have continued to
expand the business, one of the oldest
in Lee County, while still honoring
their roots. In a nod to its heritage, the
original 1926 Model-T that was used as
a delivery vehicle in Bailey’s early
days is still displayed in the store
today.
Today Bailey’s General Store has two
locations on Sanibel Island and serves
as a one-stop shopping solution, pro-
viding their customers with a plethora
of supplies, from groceries and hard-
ware to delivery and catering services.
Bailey’s is now owned by Richard and
Mary Bailey Johnson, who continue
the high standard of service to which
Sanibel Island residents and visitors
have grown accustomed. In addition to
the general store, the Bailey Johnsons’
team operates Bailey’s Coffee Bar. Lo-
cated just inside the entrance to the
store, the coffee bar serves as a gath-
ering place for tourists and locals alike
to enjoy all types of drinks, including
their unique ‘‘Bailey’s Blend,’’ in the
store’s historic atmosphere. In Sep-
tember 2018, as part of their annual
Best of the Islands banquet, the Island
Reporter and Sanibel-Captiva Islander
recognized Bailey’s for the best choco-
late shop, coffee bar, grocery store,
general store, and wine selection on
Sanibel and Captiva Islands.
Bailey’s General Store is not only a
great place for those on Sanibel Island
to shop and relax, it is an integral part
of the community. In addition to his
role as owner, Richard also works to
make Sanibel Island a better place for
both residents and tourists. He cur-
rently serves as the chair of the capital
campaign committee for the renova-
tion of the Bailey-Matthews National
Shall Museum. The museum held a
ground-breaking ceremony arlier this
month and is on track to open to the
public in early 2020. The family-owned
business is committed to giving back
to their community. Bailey’s holds an
annual fundraiser for the local FISH
food pantry, supports the local Kiwanis
Club, and sponsors a hole at the annual
miniature golf event to raise money for
the Community House on Sanibel. Ad-
ditionally, Bailey’s has been recognized
by the Lee County Economic Develop-
ment Council for their contributions to
the local economy.
Like many Floridian small busi-
nesses, Bailey’s General Store is an
outstanding example of resiliency. Bai-
ley’s has overcome a number of disas-
ters outside of their control, from mul-
tiple hurricanes to the recent red tide
bloom. Regardless of circumstance, the
team at Bailey’s has remained stead-
fast in times of adversity again and
again. Their contributions to the
Sanibel Island Community were espe-
cially noble in the aftermath of Hurri-
cane Irma in 2017. Despite damage to
the store, Bailey’s reopened the day
after the storm to provide island resi-
dents with much needed food and sup-
plies. The store became a lifeline for
residents and helped to reestablish nor-
malcy in the midst of chaos, while Bai-
ley’s employees worked for 10 days to
clear debris. Bailey’s General Store’s
contributions to their community are
an outstanding example of corporate
citizenship, and I commend them for
continuing to rise to the occasion when
their community is in need of help.
Bailey’s General Store serves as a
model for any small business wishing
to provide superior service to their cus-
tomers, while serving as a gathering
place and pillar of the community. The
team at Bailey’s routinely goes above
and beyond to ensure their customers’
needs are met, while also trying to im-
prove their beachside community.
Again, I would like to congratulate
Richard, Mary, and all of the employ-
ees at Bailey’s for being named the
Senate Small Business of the Week. I
wish you continued success in your fu-
ture endeavors.∑

S. 204. A bill to amend the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 to waive certain
penalties for affected Federal employ-
ees receiving a distribution from the
Thrift Savings Plan during a lapse in
appropriations, and for other purposes;
to the Committee on Finance.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today is
day 34 of the longest shutdown of gov-
ernment in United States history. We
must end this shutdown. We must re-
open government right away. Today, I
want to talk about legislation that
would provide some assistance to the
Federal workers who are suffering from
this unnecessary shutdown, the Emer-
gency Relief for Federal Workers Act
of 2019.
Tomorrow, 800,000 Federal workers
who work hard and just want to serve
their Nation will not receive a pay-
check. They have not received a pay-
check since December 28th, 2018. How-
ever, more than 400,000 hold positions
so essential to our Nation that they
must go to work regardless of their pay
status.
Thus shutdown hurts these workers. I
have talked about the personal stories
of Virginians who serve our Nation in
the Coast Guard, the Environmental
Protection Agency, and the Forest
Service. This shutdown means families
that have jobs cannot pay their mort-
gages or rent. They cannot buy food to
feed their families. They cannot afford
to refill prescriptions critical to the
health of their children. This shutdown
threatens Federal workers with finan-
cial ruin. Again, we must reopen the
government immediately.
We have passed legislation to provide
retroactive pay to these workers when
the shutdown ends, but we do not know
when that will happen. So today, I am
pleased to be joined by my colleagues
to introduce the Emergency Relief for
Federal Workers Act. This legislation
would allow federal employees who are
in desperate financial straits directly
because of this shutdown to borrow
from what is, for many, their largest fi-
nancial asset, their retirement ac-
count.
This legislation would allow Federal
workers in the Thrift Savings Plan to
access their savings without immediate
penalty to meet the financial hardships
caused by the government shutdown. It
would allow them to pay for basic ne-
cessities during the shutdown and
allow them to replenish their savings
after the shutdown ends.
I do not know how much longer
800,000 families will have to wait to be
made whole after this manufactured
crisis. And I do not advocate irrespon-
sibly borrowing from retirement sav-
ings. But I believe we must act to help
the people who make our federal gov-
ernment function in this time of need
they are in through no fault of their
own.
I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation. Thank you, Mr. President.

S. RES. 26
Whereas the earned income tax credit is a
refundable Federal tax credit available to
low- and moderate-income working families
and individuals;
Whereas the earned income tax credit
strengthens the rewards of work;
Whereas, in 2016, the earned income tax
credit lifted approximately 5,800,000 people

3,000,000 children;
Whereas the earned income tax credit pro-
vides substantial economic benefit to local
economies; and
Whereas an estimated 20 percent of eligible

(1) designates Friday, January 25, 2019, as

and

PERDUE, Mr. ISAKSON, and Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations:
Whereas, in late February 2014, the Russian
Federation invaded and illegally occupied
Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, in full con-
travention of the United Nations Charter
and the Helsinki Final Act, which condemn
the threat or use of force as means of alter-
ing international borders;
Whereas the Russian Federation’s at-
tempted illegal annexation of Crimea is also
a direct violation of its pledges as a signa-
tory to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on
Security Assurances to respect Ukraine’s
sovereignty and existing borders and to re-
frain from the threat or use of force against
Ukraine;
Whereas the inclusion of the United States
and the United Kingdom as signatories to
the Budapest Memorandum was essential in
order to provide Ukraine the security assur-
ances needed to give up its nuclear arsenal;
Whereas, on November 25, 2018, military
forces of the Russian Federation attacked
and seized three Ukrainian Navy vessels and
their crews as they attempted to transit the
Kerch Strait between the Black Sea and the
Sea of Azov;
Whereas the Government of the Russian
Federation still has not released the Ukrain-
ian crew members or returned the Ukrainian
ships that were seized illegally;
Whereas European Commissioner Julian
King stated that the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation launched a disinformation
campaign over a year ago designed to paint
Ukraine and NATO as provocateurs in the
Kerch Strait;
Whereas, as part of the Russian Federation
disinformation campaign, Russian state
media outlets spread demonstrable false-
hoods, including claims that Ukraine was
dredging the Kerch Strait seabed to facili-
tate the stationing of a NATO fleet, that
Ukraine had intentionally infected the sea
with cholera, and that Ukrainian and British
clandestine services were conspiring to de-
stroy the Kerch Strait bridge with a nuclear
weapon;
Whereas the United States has important
national interests in the Black Sea region,
including the security of three NATO littoral
states, the promotion of European energy
market diversification by ensuring unfet-
tered European access to energy exporters in
the Caucuses and central Asia, and com-
bating use of the region by smugglers as a
conduit for trafficking in persons, narcotics,
and arms;
Whereas the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a
proposed underwater natural gas pipeline
project that would provide an additional
55,000,000,000 cubic meters of pipeline capac-
ity from the Russian Federation to the Fed-
eral Republic of Germany through the Baltic
Sea;
Whereas the Russian Federation’s state-
owned oil and gas company, Gazprom, is the
sole shareholder of the Nord Stream 2
project;
Whereas, in 2017, there was spare capacity
of approximately 55,000,000,000 cubic meters
in the Ukrainian gas transit system;
Whereas Gazprom cut off natural gas ex-
ports to Europe via Ukraine in 2006, and
again in 2009, over supply and pricing dis-
putes with Ukraine’s state-owned oil and gas
company, Naftogaz;
Whereas transit of Russian natural gas to
Europe via Ukraine declined precipitously
after the completion of Nord Stream 1 in
2011, falling from 80 percent to between 40
and 50 percent of Russia’s total exports to
Europe;
Whereas, in 2017, Russian gas accounted for
37 percent of Europe’s natural gas imports,
an increase of 5 percent over 2016;
Whereas, on December 12, 2018, the Euro-
pean Parliament overwhelmingly passed a
resolution condemning both the Russian
Federation’s aggression in the Kerch Strait
and the construction of the Nord Stream 2
pipeline; and
Whereas, on December 11, 2018, the United
States House of Representatives passed a
resolution calling upon the European Union
to reject the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and urg-
ing the President to use all available means
to promote energy policies in Europe that re-
duce European reliance on Russian energy
exports: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) calls upon the President to work with
United States allies to promptly lead a ro-
bust multinational freedom of navigation op-
eration in the Black Sea to help demonstrate
support for internationally recognized bor-
ders, bilateral agreements, and safe passage
through the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov
and to push back against excessive Russian
Federation claims of sovereignty;
(2) calls upon the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to enhance allied maritime
presence and capabilities, including mari-
time domain awareness and coastal defense
in the Black Sea in order to support Free-
dom of Navigation Operations and allied in-
terests;
(3) urges the President to use the authority
provided under section 1234 of the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2018 (Public Law 115–91; 131 Stat. 1659) to en-
hance the capability of the Ukrainian mili-
tary;
(4) urges the President, through the De-
partments of State and Defense, to provide
additional security assistance to Ukraine,
especially to strengthen Ukraine’s maritime
capabilities, in order to improve deterrence
and defense against further Russian aggres-
sion;
(5) reiterates that the President is required
by statute to impose mandatory sanctions
on the Russian Federation under the Coun-
tering America’s Adversaries Through Sanc-
tions Act (Public Law 115–44);
(6) stresses that sanctions against the Rus-
sian Federation are a direct result of the ac-
tions of the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration and will continue and increase until
there is an appropriate change in Russian be-
havior;
(7) calls upon United States allies and part-

access to their ports to resupply and refuel;
(8) notes the resolution passed by the

tion condemning Russian aggression in the

its threat to European energy security, and

NIZING JANUARY 2019 AS ‘‘NA-

TILLIS, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Ms. WARREN,
Ms. COLLINS, and Mr. GRASSLEY) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 28
Whereas the goals of National Mentoring
Month are to raise awareness of mentoring,
recruit individuals to mentor, celebrate the
powerful impact of caring adults who volun-
teer time for the benefit of young people, and
encourage organizations to engage and inte-
grate quality in mentoring into the efforts of
the organizations;
Whereas there are young people across the
United States who make everyday choices
that lead to the big decisions in life without
the guidance and support on which many
other young people rely;
Whereas a mentor is a caring, consistent
presence who devotes time to a young person
to help that young person discover personal
strength and achieve the potential of that
young person;
Whereas quality mentoring encourages
positive life and social skills, promotes self-
esteem, bolsters academic achievement and
college access, and nurtures young leader-
ship development;
Whereas mentoring programs have been
shown to be effective in helping young people
make positive choices;
Whereas young people who meet regularly
with mentors are 46 percent less likely than
peers to start using illegal drugs;
Whereas research shows that young people
who were at risk for not completing high
school but who had a mentor were, as com-
pared with similarly situated young people
without a mentor—
(1) 55 percent more likely to be enrolled in
college;
(2) 81 percent more likely to report partici-
pating regularly in sports or extracurricular
activities;
(3) more than twice as likely to say they
held a leadership position in a club or sports
team; and
(4) 78 percent more likely to pay it forward
by volunteering regularly in the commu-
nities of young people;
Whereas 90 percent of young people who
were at risk for not completing high school
but who had a mentor said they are now in-
terested in becoming mentors themselves;
Whereas mentoring can play a role in help-
ing young people attend school regularly, as

research shows that students who meet regu-
larly with a mentor are, as compared with
the peers of those students—
(1) 52 percent less likely to skip a full day
of school; and
(2) 37 percent less likely to skip a class;
Whereas youth development experts agree
that mentoring encourages positive youth
development and smart daily behaviors, such
as finishing homework and having healthy
social interactions, and has a positive im-
pact on the growth and success of a young
person;
Whereas mentors help young people set ca-
reer goals and use the personal contacts of
the mentors to help young people meet in-
dustry professionals and train for and find
jobs;
Whereas each of the benefits of mentors de-
scribed in this preamble serves to link youth
to economic and social opportunity while
also strengthening communities in the
United States; and
Whereas, despite those described benefits,
an estimated 9,000,000 young people in the
United States feel isolated from meaningful
connections with adults outside the home,
constituting a ‘‘mentoring gap’’ that dem-
onstrates a need for collaboration and re-
sources: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes January 2019 as ‘‘National
Mentoring Month’’;
(2) recognizes the caring adults who serve
as staff and volunteers at quality mentoring
programs and help the young people of the
United States find inner strength and reach
their full potential;
(3) acknowledges that mentoring is bene-
ficial because mentoring supports edu-
cational achievement and self-confidence,
supports young people in setting career goals
and expanding social capital, reduces juve-
nile delinquency, improves positive personal,
professional, and academic outcomes, and
strengthens communities;
(4) promotes the establishment and expan-
sion of quality mentoring programs across
the United States to equip young people with
the tools needed to lead healthy and produc-
tive lives; and
(5) supports initiatives to close the ‘‘men-
toring gap’’ that exists for the many young
people in the United States who do not have
meaningful connections with adults outside
the home.

ment that permits individuals and entities
awaiting assistance and the general public to
see how all grant funds are used, including

ther, That prior to the obligation of funds a

how the use of these funds will address long-
term recovery and restoration of infrastruc-

tressed areas: Provided further, That such

Provided further, That the sixth proviso
under this heading in the Supplemental Ap-

of general local government, or Indian tribe
(as such term is defined in section 102 of the
Housing and Community Development Act of
1974 (42 U.S.C. 5302))’’: Provided further, That
in administering the funds under this head-
ing, the Secretary of Housing and Urban De-
velopment may waive, or specify alternative
requirements for, any provision of any stat-
ute or regulation that the Secretary admin-
isters in connection with the obligation by
the Secretary or the use by the recipient of
these funds (except for requirements related
to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor
standards, and the environment), if the Sec-
retary finds that good cause exists for the
waiver or alternative requirement and such
waiver or alternative requirement would not
be inconsistent with the overall purpose of
title I of the Housing and Community Devel-
opment Act of 1974: Provided further, That,
notwithstanding the preceding proviso, re-
cipients of funds provided under this heading
that use such funds to supplement Federal

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency As-
sistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) may
adopt, without review or public comment,
any environmental review, approval, or per-
mit performed by a Federal agency, and such
adoption shall satisfy the responsibilities of
the recipient with respect to such environ-
mental review, approval or permit: Provided
further, That, notwithstanding section
104(g)(2) of the Housing and Community De-
velopment Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5304(g)(2)),
the Secretary may, upon receipt of a request
for release of funds and certification, imme-
diately approve the release of funds for an
activity or project assisted under this head-
ing if the recipient has adopted an environ-
mental review, approval or permit under the
preceding proviso or the activity or project
is categorically excluded from review under
the National Environmental Policy Act of
1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.): Provided further,
That the Secretary shall publish via notice
in the Federal Register any waiver, or alter-
native requirement, to any statute or regula-
tion that the Secretary administers pursu-
ant to title I of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1974 no later than 5 days
before the effective date of such waiver or al-
ternative requirement: Provided further, That
of the amounts made available under this
heading, up to $5,000,000 shall be made avail-
able for capacity building and technical as-
sistance, including assistance on contracting
and procurement processes, to support
States, units of general local government, or

able for any of the same such purposes speci-
fied under this heading or the same heading
in Public Law 115–254 without limitation:
Provided further, That such amount is des-
ignated by the Congress as being for an
emergency requirement pursuant to section
251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and

GENERAL PROVISION—THIS TITLE
SEC. 1001. (a) Amounts previously made
available for activities authorized under
title I of the Housing and Community Devel-
opment Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) re-
lated to disaster relief, long-term recovery,

sulting from a major disaster, including
funds provided under section 145 of division C
of Public Law 114–223, section 192 of division
C of Public Law 114–223 (as added by section
101(3) of division A of Public Law 114–254),

and any mitigation funding provided under
the heading ‘‘Department of Housing and

cated in response to Hurricane Matthew,

ment of Housing and Urban Development—

sion or in division I of Public Law 115–254
that are allocated in response to Hurricane
Florence may be used interchangeably and
without limitation for the same activities in
the most impacted and distressed areas re-
lated to Hurricane Matthew. Until HUD pub-
lishes the Federal Register Notice imple-
menting this provision, grantees may submit
for HUD approval revised plans for the use of
funds related to Hurricane Matthew that ex-
pand the eligible beneficiaries of existing
programs contained in such previously ap-
proved plans to include those impacted by
Hurricane Florence. Approval of any such re-
vised plans shall include the execution of re-
vised grant terms and conditions as nec-
essary. Once the implementing Notice is
published, any additional action plan revi-
sions shall follow the requirements con-
tained therein.

trative costs for activities authorized under

restoration of infrastructure and housing,
economic revitalization, and mitigation in
the most impacted and distressed areas
under this division or any future Act, and
amounts previously provided under section
420 of division L of Public Law 114–113, sec-
tion 145 of division C of Public Law 114–223,
section 192 of division C of Public Law 114–
223 (as added by section 101(3) of division A of
Public Law 114–254), section 421 of division K
of Public Law 115–31, and under the heading
‘‘Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment—Community Planning and Develop-
ment—Community Development Fund’’ of
division B of Public Law 115–56, Public Law
115–123, and Public Law 115–254, shall be
available for eligible administrative costs of
the grantee related to any disaster relief
funding identified in this subsection without
regard to the particular disaster appropria-
tion from which such funds originated.

section for amounts that were previously
designated by the Congress, respectively, as
an emergency requirement or as being for
disaster relief pursuant to the Balanced

quently so designates all such amounts and

(2) by adding after section 136 the fol-
lowing:
‘‘SEC. 137. Amounts made available in this
Act for personnel pay, allowances, and bene-
fits in each department and agency shall be
available for obligations incurred pursuant
to 31 U.S.C. 1341.
‘‘SEC. 138. All obligations incurred and in
anticipation of the appropriations made and
authority granted by this Act for the pur-
poses of maintaining the essential level of
activity to protect life and property and
bringing about orderly termination of Gov-
ernment function, and for purposes as other-
wise authorized by law, are hereby ratified
and approved if otherwise in accord with the
provisions of this Act.
‘‘SEC. 139. (a) If a State (or another Federal
grantee) used State funds (or the grantee’s
non-Federal funds) to continue carrying out
a Federal program or furloughed State em-
ployees (or the grantee’s employees) whose
compensation is advanced or reimbursed in
whole or in part by the Federal Govern-
ment—
‘‘(1) such furloughed employees shall be
compensated at their standard rate of com-
pensation for such period;
‘‘(2) the State (or such other grantee) shall
be reimbursed for expenses that would have
been paid by the Federal Government during
such period had appropriations been avail-
able, including the cost of compensating
such furloughed employees, together with in-
terest thereon calculated under section
6503(d) of title 31, United States Code; and
‘‘(3) the State (or such other grantee) may
use funds available to the State (or the
grantee) under such Federal program to re-
imburse such State (or the grantee), to-
gether with interest thereon calculated
under section 6503(d) of title 31, United
States Code.
‘‘(b) For purposes of this section, the term
‘State’ and the term ‘grantee’ shall have the
meaning as such term is defined under the
applicable Federal program under subsection
(a). In addition, ‘to continue carrying out a
Federal program’ means the continued per-
formance by a State or other Federal grant-
ee, during the period of a lapse in appropria-
tions, of a Federal program that the State or
such other grantee had been carrying out
prior to the period of the lapse in appropria-
tions.
‘‘(c) The authority under this section ap-
plies with respect to any period in fiscal year
2019 (not limited to periods beginning or end-
ing after the date of the enactment of this
Act) during which there occurs a lapse in ap-
propriations with respect to any department
or agency of the Federal Government which,
but for such lapse in appropriations, would
have paid, or made reimbursement relating
to, any of the expenses referred to in this
section with respect to the program in-
volved. Payments and reimbursements under
this authority shall be made only to the ex-
tent and in amounts provided in advance in
appropriations Acts.’’.
SEC. 102. For the purposes of division C of
Public Law 115–245, the time covered by such
division shall be considered to include the
period which began on or about December 22,
2018, during which there occurred a lapse in
appropriations.
SEC. 103. Subsection (c)(2) of section 1341 of
title 31, United States Code, is amended by
inserting ‘‘, and subject to the enactment of
appropriations Acts ending the lapse’’ before
the period.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Further Ad-
ditional Continuing Appropriations Act,
2019’’.

MARKING THE RETIREMENT OF
STEVE HEMINGER
HON. NANCY PELOSI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise with
my colleagues to pay tribute to an outstanding
regional leader who has had a powerful na-
tional impact: Steve Heminger, Executive Di-
rector of the San Francisco Bay Area’s Metro-
politan Transportation Commission (MTC).
Steve is retiring on February 28, 2019, after
17 years in this position and 25 years of lead-
ership at the agency. It is a pleasure to be
joined by other members of the Bay Area del-
egation, including Congresswoman BARBARA
LEE, Congressman JARED HUFFMAN, Con-
gresswoman ZOE LOFGREN, Congressman
ERIC SWALWELL, Congressman MIKE THOMP-
SON and Congresswoman ANNA ESHOO, in
honoring his many accomplishments.
In the Bay Area and around the country, he
is known for the boldness of his vision and the
quality of his leadership. At the helm of MTC,
he positioned the Commission not only to take
on the challenges of the 21st Century Econ-
omy, but also to take a strong, active role in
the fight against the existential problem of our
time: the climate crisis. His leadership has
helped shape the Bay Area’s economic land-
scape and transform the way our community
lives, works and commutes.
Under Steve’s leadership, MTC has played
a vital role in growing the Bay Area in a more
green and sustainable way, encouraging tran-
sit-oriented development, containing sprawl
and making public transit, bicycling and walk-
ing viable alternatives to solo driving. Through
the Committee to House the Bay Area
(CASA), Steve has brought together a ‘‘who’s
who’’ of housing policy and development to
address the region’s affordable housing crisis.
Under Steve’s direction, MTC has helped
achieve historic achievements, including: the
Fourth Bore of the Caldecott Tunnel; the sui-
cide barrier for the Golden Gate Bridge; the
Presidio Parkway approach to the Golden
Gate; the BART extensions to East Contra
Costa County and Warm Springs, and ulti-
mately to San Jose; the stunning new East
Span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge; and a new commuter rail line tying to-
gether Marin and Sonoma counties. We also
commend his vision in launching Clipper®, the
all-in-one transit fare card that lets riders hop
between 22 bus, rail and ferry systems that
cross the Bay Area.
Steve is widely recognized nationally as an
expert in transportation policy, and for this rea-
son I was honored to appoint him in 2005 to
the National Surface Transportation Policy and
Revenue Study Commission, which helped
chart the future course for federal transpor-
tation investments. Under Steve’s direction,
MTC has been a key voice in the crafting of
multiple multiyear transportation authorization
bills passed by Congress, from TEA–21 to
SAFETEA–LU to MAP–21 to FAST.
Congratulations, Steve, on an outstanding
career and please accept our deepest appre-
ciation for dedicating twenty-five years to ad-
vancing a cleaner, safer, greener and more
sustainable home for our children and grand-
children.

HONORING THE LIFE OF HAYDON
MICHELLE PAYNE ISHMAEL
HON. MARKWAYNE MULLIN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. MULLIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life of Haydon Michelle Payne
Ishmael, a loving wife and mother who was
taken from her family too soon after losing her
battle with breast cancer. She was a vivacious
and loving spirit with a heart for service, and
she gave everything one hundred percent.
Whether she was racing cars, scoring goals in
a soccer game, volunteering, or cheering on
her kids, her energy and enthusiasm shined
through.
She leaves behind her husband and child-
hood sweetheart Todd, her children Madysen,
Jewele, and William, her mother Gail (Curtis)
Payne and her mother-in-law Penny (Cornel)
Ishmael. Her siblings Anne (Payne) and Scott
McGarry, Kelly (Payne) and Brad Spears and
Will and Brandi Payne, Todd’s siblings Tripp
and Kelly Ishmael and Thomas and Michelle
Ishmael, eleven nieces and nephews, aunt
and uncles, cousins and great nieces and
nephews. She has gone to be with her Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ and will be greatly
missed.

RECOGNIZING FAITH BLACKABY
OF WHITEFISH AND JULIA AND
JILLIAN WYNNE OF BIGFORK
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Faith Blackaby of Whitefish
and Julia and Jillian Wynne of Bigfork, teen-
agers who encourage girls to read and whose
work has benefited veterans and pet adoption
centers in their communities.
Julia, a student at Flathead High School in
Kalispell, hosts a weekly book club to inspire
third and fourth grade girls to explore their
world through reading. She also wrote Shelter
Tails, a book featuring pet adoption stories
from her community. The proceeds from her
book benefited the Flathead County Animal
Shelter.
Inspired by her older sister’s community
service, Jillian, a student at Flathead High
School, and Faith, a close friend and student
at Whitefish High School, also hosted a book
club for girls.
Jillian and Faith designed and published a
calendar featuring photographs and stories
about local veterans. The proceeds benefited
the Northwest Montana Veterans Food Pantry.
For a calendar the next year, they focused
on pet adoption, and the proceeds benefited
the Humane Society of Northwest Montana.
Mike and Renee Wynne, and Dean and
Janet Blackaby have reason to be proud of
their children. I thank the Wynnes, the
Blackabys, and all in the community who sup-
port and encourage Julia, Jillian, and Faith in
their service.
Madam Speaker, for their inspiration, lead-
ership, and community service, I recognize
Faith Blackaby and Julia and Jillian Wynne for
their spirit of Montana.

FARM SHOW CONGRATULATIONS
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to acknowledge the accomplishments of
residents from my district, who recently com-
peted in the 103rd Annual Pennsylvania Farm
Show, which is the nation’s largest indoor agri-
cultural exposition.
For one week each January, residents from
across the Commonwealth come to view and
interact with the best of Pennsylvania’s farm-
ing community.
Lancaster and York Counties in the district
I represent, proudly boast the most fertile soil
of anywhere in the world. In our communities,
our agricultural traditions and heritage run
deep.
We have award winners from all across the
district: Steve Topper from Hanover won nu-
merous 1st place awards for his chicken en-
tries; the Espenshades—Evan, Alan and
Charlene of Bainbridge won numerous awards
for their dairy cattle entries; the Manheim Cen-
tral FFA Chapter won the ‘‘Best of Show
Award’’ for Antique Tractor Restoration; a
mother and daughter team, Dorothy Martin
and her daughter Debra Berkoski of Con-
estoga, won awards for baked goods while
competing against one another.
Alpine Heritage Creamery in Paradise had
award-winning cheese; Kermit Miller of Felton
and Charles Hess of Pequea have award win-
ning soybeans; and Madam Speaker, brew-
eries and vineyards from across the district
were remarkably successful—St. Boniface,
Aldus Brewing, Swashbuckler Brewing, Stoudt
Brewing, Mount Hope Winery, Nissley,
Levengood’s and Wynridge all took awards
home this year.
I’d also like to congratulate all the members
of the Future Farmers of America from my dis-
trict who received their Keystone Degrees this
year and who entered exhibits.
Their dedication of learning to do, doing to
learn, earning to live and living to serve—the
FFA motto—will provide them lessons that
they will use all of their lives.

HONORING MICHAEL ‘‘BIG MIKE’’
PHILLIPS
HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker,
I rise with great admiration to honor the efforts
of a humble hero in San Diego and our
LGBTQ community, Michael ‘‘Big Mike’’ Phil-
lips.
Big Mike may have received his namesake
due to his tall stature, but there is nothing big-
ger about him than his enormous heart. Those
who have had the pleasure to cross paths with
Big Mike know him as a warm, empathetic,
and gregarious soul, dedicated to improving
the lives of others. He has a unique way of
welcoming total strangers and making them
feel included, loved, and a part of our commu-
nity.
Throughout over four decades working in all
aspects of the hospitality industry, Big Mike
has come to be an expert in the art of serving
others. Whether he’s serving food and bev-
erages to friends or new friends, hosting a
charitable event, or photographing history in
the making, his main concern is always the
happiness and fulfillment of the people around
him.
Big Mike’s selflessness may be what helps
to make him such a talented photographer.
When he looks through a lens, his focus re-
mains solely on the people and the moment.
He has captured local historic LGBTQ events,
multiple LGBTQ Marches on Washington, and
even photographed four living U.S. Presidents
and First Ladies at the opening of the Clinton
Library.
In all endeavors, Big Mike gives one hun-
dred percent of his head and his heart. He
has contributed to so many charitable organi-
zations that I could not possibly list them all.
When Special Delivery San Diego, a nonprofit
that provides meals to individuals living with
HIV/AIDS, was in need of funding, he inspired
128 other bartenders to enroll in an effort to
donate to the program. He has the rare ability
to inspire others to be a part of something
greater than themselves. Using this skill, Big
Mike helped to found Ordinary Miracles and
The Rob Benzon Foundation, two non-profits
with the mission of welcoming individuals to
add their own light to the world that when
joined together, illuminates and eases the
needs of the abused, sick, and hungry.
When leaders in our community search for
a sense of direction and initiative, they often
look no further than Big Mike—which can ex-
plain why he has been appointed to serve on
community advisory boards under almost
every single mayor in recent San Diego his-
tory.
Though he has lived an accomplished life,
Big Mike is quick to give credit to his caring
adoptive parents, his loyal friends, and all who
have supported him along the way. It is ex-
ceptional to find a person who has carried out
their career and lived their life almost entirely
for the benefit of others, and I can honestly
say that Big Mike is one of them.
Even on his birthday, he cannot help but
use the opportunity to make the world a better
place to live. Every year, Big Mike hosts his
Birthday Fundraiser to boost awareness and
support for various non-profit organizations
and invaluable local resources.
On the 20th Anniversary of his first Birthday
Fundraiser, I commend Michael ‘‘Big Mike’’
Phillips for his continuous and substantial ef-
forts to lend love, hope, and a helping hand to
all in need. I extend my congratulations and
best wishes to him for a successful event and
a wonderful year ahead.
Though Mike was born in Germany, and
raised in Texas, I am so pleased that he
adopted San Diego as his home. San Diego is
an even finer place to live because Big Mike
was born.

daughter, fiancé, sister, grandmother, aunt,

woman and a staple of our community for all
of her professional life.

College and her Bachelors in Business Admin-
istration from the University of Miami. Darlene
initially worked as a coordinator for the Radi-
ology department at Good Samaritans Hos-
pital for 15 years, where she was able to dis-
play her passion for helping people in need.
She then followed her desire to aid her com-
munity when she moved to work at Riviera
Beach Community Redevelopment Agency
(CRA) as their Community Redevelopment Di-
rector, where she had served for the last ten
plus years. Darlene’s hard work and dedica-
tion will always be remembered by her co-
workers.
Darlene’s commitment to community work
did not stop at the CRA. She loved volun-
teering and was the president of the Lime-
stone Creek Community group, a non-for-profit
advocacy organization with a primary focus on
improving, protecting and promoting civic, cul-
tural and recreational community interests.
Madam Speaker, Darlene will be remem-
bered by the many people she touched in her
44 years of life. She held herself to the high-
est standards, and always encouraged others
to be successful contributing members of soci-
ety, in whatever way that could be. Fond
memories of her will forever remain with her
parents, Willie and Pearline, her fiancé, David
Coley, and her two children, Johnathan and
Shatoria, as well as her two grandchildren,
Noah and Jeremiah. I offer my deepest condo-
lences to her entire family during this time of
great sadness. She was truly a blessing to our
community, and I am pleased to honor her
memory today. She will be dearly missed.

HON. SAM GRAVES

Greenwald. Payton is a very special young
man who has exemplified the finest qualities

Payton has been very active with his troop,

Payton has also contributed to his community

signed and completed a gazebo for St. James
Catholic Church in Liberty, Missouri, creating a
space for ‘‘buddy benches’’ where children
can sit and talk in the playground area.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join

COMMEMORATING THE 20TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF LOUISVILLE’S
FAIRNESS ORDINANCE
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise to
commemorate 20 years of Fairness in my
hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.
It’s upsetting to think, but in much of the
country, it’s legal to kick someone out of their
home or fire them for no reason but how they
love. For being LGBTQ, for being gay.
But not in Louisville.
Because on January 26, 1999, our commu-
nity took a bold and historic step for LGBTQ
rights, passing the Fairness Ordinance and
ensuring that no individual could be robbed of
their home or job simply for being who they
are.
Louisville was the first in our Common-
wealth and among the first in the South to pro-
tect LGBTQ people from discrimination, and it
was due to a decade of committed work by
the Fairness Campaign’s passionate staff and
volunteers, who refused to accept anything but
real, true equality.
In two decades since, Fairness has helped
10 Kentucky cities outlaw LGBTQ discrimina-
tion—from our capital Frankfort to the tiny Ap-
palachian coal town of Vicco and beyond.
The rest of Kentucky and our country should
follow Louisville’s lead and ban LGBTQ dis-
crimination everywhere. I look forward to con-
tinuing Louisville’s legacy by casting my vote
for the Federal Equality Act in this Congress
and I urge every Member to join me.

Saints in the 2019 NFC Championship Game.
The Rams won the opportunity to face off with
the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII

an all-American sport and is the most popular
sport in America. As such, the Rams are con-
gratulated by all of their hometown fans and
admirers across the country for their spectac-

commend these players as well as the players
and staff of all NFL teams for their tremen-

Landon is a very special young man who has

Landon has been very active with his troop,

This reflection area is along the missionary

HONORING MS. NANCY L.
KUTULAS FOR HER 36 YEARS OF
SERVICE TO OUR NATION
HON. RICHARD HUDSON
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Ms. Nancy L. Kutulas as she re-
tires after 36 years of dedicated service as a
Department of the Army Civil Librarian.
There is a reverence that comes with the
humble and steadfast service Ms. Kutulas has
shown our country over nearly four decades.
As one commander at the John F. Kennedy
Special Warfare Center and School eloquently
put it when summing up her career, there is
‘‘no better example of the quiet professional
and devoted civil servant’’ than Nancy Kutulas.
While Ms. Kutulas has served in many pres-
tigious posts over the years, she spent the
vast majority of it at the epicenter of the uni-
verse, Fort Bragg, located in North Carolina’s
Eighth Congressional District. And throughout
her career, Ms. Kutulas has time and again
been recognized for her hard work and dedi-
cation. In fact, last year she was named the
United States Army Special Operations Com-
mand Unsung Hero of the Year.
One example of her tenacity and resource-
fulness was recently exhibited when she pro-
vided a Special Forces Operational Detach-
ment Alpha (ODA) with vital information on a
newly-operational weapon system that arrived
before the soldiers had been trained how to
use it. Ms. Kutulas sprang into action, tracking
down the necessary information and dis-
patching the necessary experts to train the
soldiers to successfully deploy the new sys-
tem—all while under heavy enemy fire. With-
out her quick actions, who knows how things
may have ended for the soldiers.
I wish Ms. Kutulas a long and happy retire-
ment, and I know I speak for countless service
members and their families when I say she
will be forever missed.
Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking
Ms. Kutulas for her 36 years of dedicated
service.

Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I
rise in honor of the outstanding achievement
of Appleton, Wisconsin, resident, Mr. Henry
Anderson. I rise to recognize Henry for rep-
resenting the United States Natural Track
Luge Team in upcoming World Cup events.
To be selected to represent the United States
on a worldwide stage is a significant honor.
This is not only an incredible opportunity but
also an outstanding accomplishment for a
young man merely 14 years old. I wish Henry
and his teammate, Torrey Cookman of the
Honorable Mr. BERGMAN’s District, all the best
in their preparation and competition.
Henry and Torrey departed on Christmas
Day 2018 for Austria to begin preparation for
the World Championship series, which is held
at different venues across Europe, including
Austria, Italy, and Germany in January and
February. They are competing with world-class
competition and representing Northeast Wis-
consin and the United States with pride and
dignity both on and off the track.
As Henry continues his travels in Europe to
prepare for the World Cup Championship Se-
ries, I wish him the best of luck, the best
memories and life experiences that I hope he
will reflect on as he grows older. The team’s
travels will allow its members to showcase
some of the great talent that the United States
and Northeast Wisconsin has to offer. While
this is Henry’s first time competing for Team
USA, I am certain it will not be his last.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize
Henry Anderson for his participation in the
Natural Luge World Championship as a mem-
ber of the United States Natural Track Luge
Team. Wisconsinites can take great pride in
knowing the Eighth District is home to such a
talented and dedicated individual. On behalf of
my constituents, I wish Henry all the best in
his future endeavors.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
LADDIE FRANK JANDA
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
memory of Laddie Frank Janda, a Victoria na-
tive and World War II Army veteran who dedi-
cated his life to serving his community.
Laddie Frank Janda, born on March 13,
1925, in Shiner, Texas, passed away on De-
cember 9, 2018, at the age of 93.
In April 1943, when he was 18 years old,
Janda enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he re-
ceived training as a medic. He was assigned
to the 104th Medical Battalion, 116th Regi-
mental Combat Team, 29th Infantry Division.
His unit was selected as one of the lead units
of D-Day.
Barely an hour after the first wave of Allied
troops landed on Omaha Beach, Janda start-
ed tending to the wounded. He continued
treating the injured for an additional six weeks
until he himself was seriously wounded by
shrapnel on July 11th.
The Army recognized his bravery and valor
by bestowing on Janda the Bronze Star, Pur-
ple Heart, and World War II Victory Medal.
After his Army service, Janda enrolled at
Baldwin Business College in Yoakum, where
he studied bookkeeping. He moved to Victoria
in the late 1940s and in 1951 began a 34-year
career with Victoria Bank and Trust, retiring as
vice-president in 1985.
I would like to extend my heartfelt condo-
lences to the Janda family and express appre-
ciation for his service to our community and
sacrifices for our country.

CELEBRATION OF THE LIFE OF
RESSIE DAVIS ENGLISH
HON. COLIN Z. ALLRED
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, today I in-
clude in the RECORD the life, the story and the
legacy of Ressie Davis English. The grand-
mother of my colleague, friend and fellow
Texan, Congressman MARC VEASEY.
Mrs. English passed on January 18, 2019,
after 106 years of life. Throughout her life, she
was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother,
great grandmother, gardener and student of
scripture.
On July 29, 1912, in the small town of Rice,
Mr. William and Mrs. Mary Hart Davis com-
pleted their family of six with a newborn girl
they named Ressie Davis. Mr. Davis, like most
black citizens of Navarro County at the time,
was a farmer. Mr. Davis’s father, a well-edu-
cated and regarded Baptist minister was reso-
lute in his belief that to do well, his children

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E87

needed to be well educated and passed this
belief onto his children.
To be black and well educated required that
the Davis family find schools beyond the
small, rural, operations for black children that
existed at the time. Ressie attended high
school at Jackson in Corsicana. Jackson was
the designated school in town for black stu-
dents during the era of segregation in Texas.
Ressie ’s family left Rice and moved to where
she met the love of her life, Robert March
English.
She and Dr. English, ‘Bob’, married in the
spring of 1939, and a few years later had their
first child, a daughter named, Mary LlaBetta.
By the time a second daughter, Lizzie Eliza-
beth Janet arrived, the family was living in the
bustling town of Mineral Wells, Texas, and Dr.
English had become an established young
and dynamic Baptist minister working in
Jacksboro, Texas.
Dr. English soon became vice-moderator
and later moderator of the West Texas District
Baptist Association. His ministry flourished, but
the need for better medical resources dictated
a return to Corsicana. They later added to the
family daughters Doris Theresa, ‘‘SanDei’’,
and Eva Carolyn and their two sons, Robert
James and Joseph Hart-Davis English.
Ressie settled into her role of minister’s wife
working as a homemaker and running her
household with great diligence. She agreed to
move to Fort Worth with the caveat that if the
church was to be in Lake Como, housing had
to be found within walking distance to Como
elementary school. Her last three children,
Constance Grace, John Moses and Rubye
DeiGratia were born in Lake Como. Fully set-
tled in Fort Worth, all nine of the children
graduated from or attended Como senior high
school.
The English’s were well regarded in the
Lake Como community, unwavering in their
commitment to the church, and steadfast in
overseeing the activities of their nine children.
The children participated in everything the
school had to offer. Ressie made sure her
children became fixtures in the recreational
and academic setting in the Como community;
from piano lessons to track and football, to the
PTA, Drama and Debate Club to the National
Honors Society, they did it all.
After the establishment of the first church
commissioned by the West Texas Baptist As-
sociation, Ressie became ‘‘First Lady’’ of an-
other church, independently established by her
husband. They named it Mount Moriah Baptist
Church. Dr. English guided this church until
his death in 1987. Ressie always put God and
family first, and in her spare time, she enjoyed
gardening and harvesting fruit and vegetables
at her Lake Como home. Trips to the now ob-
solete retailers, Handy Dan and Sutherland’s,
were her favorite places to buy outdoor and
home improvement items. While she did enjoy
fresh food; she never turned down a good
Breakfast Jack or a two-piece meal from
Churches on Lackland and Camp Bowie.
In addition to gardening, Ressie was also
very handy at sewing; and always kept a ma-
chine, which she was very proud of, nestled
near a corner window in her dining room. But
most importantly Ressie enjoyed studying the
Bible, and for most of her 106 years, she
could quote scripture and the words of Jesus
Christ with remarkable accuracy and clarity.
She oftentimes hummed churched hymns
while knitting, reading, or working outdoors.
And her memory allowed her to be a master
storyteller of days long gone. The summer of
2018 marked 106 years in the life of Ressie
Davis English. On January 18, 2019, she went
home to be with her Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ. We celebrate her life today with these
words forever enshrined into the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD of the United States House of
Representatives, where her grandson Marc
Veasey serves. She was preceded in death by
her husband Dr. Robert English and three chil-
dren Mary LlaBetta Sowels, Robert James
English and Joseph Hart English, and two
granddaughters.
Her legacy continues through her children,
Elizabeth English Burky, Doris Theresa
English, Eva Carolyn English-Clay, Constance
English Cash, John Moses English and Char-
ley Rubye English-Carter. She is also survived
by many grandchildren, and great-grand-
children and great-great-grandchildren. Her
kids and grandchildren have gone on to work
in broadcasting, higher education, politics, the
food and beverage industry, and many other
endeavors of hard work and accomplishment
of which Mrs. English was very proud.
I wish Mrs. English peace and my deepest
condolences to Congressman VEASEY and his
family.

RECOGNIZING AN OP-ED WRITTEN
BY MR. BILL PASCRELL
HON. JAMIE RASKIN
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to share an excellent op-ed written by my col-
league Mr. BILL PASCRELL, entitled, ‘‘Why is
Congress so dumb?’’ In this lucid essay, Rep.
PASCRELL discusses the systematic demolition
of Congress’ power to assemble accurate in-
formation, conduct investigations and develop
sound policy. It is an imperative of the 116th
Congress that we rebuild Congressional ca-
pacity to govern with the information we need.
In his piece, which appeared in the Wash-
ington Post, Mr. PASCRELL writes:
In a year of congressional low lights, the
hearings we held with Silicon Valley leaders
last fall may have been the lowest. One of
my colleagues in the House asked Google
CEO Sundar Pichai about the workings of an
iPhone—a rival Apple product. Another col-
league asked Face book head Mark
Zuckerberg, ‘‘If you’re not listening to us on
the phone, who is?’’ One senator was flab-
bergasted to learn that Facebook makes
money from advertising. Over hours of testi-
mony, my fellow members of Congress strug-
gled to grapple with technologies used daily
by most Americans and with the functions of
the Internet itself. Given an opportunity to
expose the most powerful businesses on
Earth to sunlight and scrutiny, the hearings
did little to answer tough questions about
the tech titans’ monopolies or the impact of
their platforms. It’s not because lawmakers
are too stupid to understand Facebook. It’s
because our available resources and our pol-
icy staffs, the brains of Congress, have been
so depleted that we can’t do our jobs prop-
erly.
Americans who bemoan a broken Congress
rightly focus on ethical questions and elec-
toral partisanship. But the tech hearings
demonstrated that our greatest deficiency
may be knowledge, not cooperation. Our
founts of independent information have been
cut off, our investigatory muscles atrophied,
our committees stripped oftheir ability to
develop policy, our small staffs overwhelmed
by the army of lobbyists who roam Wash-
ington. Congress is increasingly unable to
comprehend a world growing more socially,
economically and technologically multi-
faceted—and we did this to ourselves. When
the 110th Congress opened in 2007, Democrats
rode into office on a tide of outrage at the
George W. Bush administration and the Re-
publican Congress, which had looked the
other way during the Tom DeLay, Jack
Abramoff and Duke Cunningham scandals.
My colleagues and I focused our energies on
exposing corruption. But we missed crucial

opportunities to reform the institution of
Congress. As my party assumes a new major-
ity in the House, we confront similar cir-
cumstances and have a second chance to
begin the hard work of nursing our chamber
back to strength.
Our decay as an institution began in 1995,
when conservatives, led by then-Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R–Ga.), carried out a full-
scale war on government. Gingrich began by
slashing the congressional workforce by one-
third. He aimed particular ire at Congress’s
brain, firing 1 of every 3 staffers at the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office, the Congres-
sional Research Service and the Congres-
sional Budget Office. He defunded the Office
of Technology Assessment, a tech-focused
think tank. Social scientists have called
those moves Congress’s self-lobotomy, and
the cuts remain largely unreversed.
Gingrich’s actions didn’t stop with
Congress’s mind: He went for its arms and
legs, too, as he dismantled the committee
system, taking power from chairmen and
shifting it to leadership. His successors as
speaker have entrenched this practice. While
there was a 35 percent decline in committee
staffing from 1994 to 2014, funding over that
period for leadership staff rose 89 percent.
This imbalance has defanged many of our
committees, as bills originating in leader-
ship offices and K Street suites are forced
through without analysis or alteration. Very
often, lawmakers never even see important
legislation until right before we vote on it.
During the debate over the Republicans’ 2017
tax package, hours before the floor vote,
then-Sen. Claire McCaskill (D–Mo.) tweeted
a lobbying firm’s summary of GOP amend-
ments to the bill before she and her col-
leagues had had a chance to read the legisla-
tion. A similar process played out during the
Republicans’ other signature effort of the
last Congress, the failed repeal of the Afford-
able Care Act. Their bill would have remade
one-sixth ofthe U.S. economy, but it was not
subject to hearings and was introduced just
a few hours before being voted on in the dead
of night. This is what happens when legisla-
tion is no longer grown organically through
hearings and debate.
Congress does not have the resources to
counter the growth of corporate lobbying.
Between 1980 and 2006, the number of organi-
zations in Washington with lobbying arms
more than doubled, and lobbying expendi-
tures between 1983 and 2013 ballooned from
$200 million to $3.2 billion. A stunning 2015
study found that corporations now devote
more resources to lobby Congress than Con-
gress spends to fund itself. During the 2017
fight over the tax legislation, the watchdog
group Public Citizen found that there were
more than 6,200 registered tax lobbyists, vs.
130 aides on the Senate Finance Committee
and the Joint Committee on Taxation, a
staggering ratio approaching 50–to–1
disfavoring the American people. In 2016 in
the House, there were just 1,300 aides on all
committees combined, a number that in-
cludes clerical and communications workers.
Our expert policy staffs are dwarfed by the
lobbying class.
The practical impact of this disparity is
impossible to overstate as lobbyists flood our
offices with information on issues and legis-
lation—information on which many law-
makers have become reliant. Just a few
weeks ago, at the end of the session, I wit-
nessed the biennial tradition of departing
members of Congress relinquishing their
suites to the incoming class. As lawmakers
emptied their desks and cabinets, the office
hallways were clogged with dumpsters over-
flowing with reports, white papers, massaged
data and other materials, a perfect illustra-
tion of the proliferating junk dropped off by
lobbyists.
Congress remade its committees in the
1970s to challenge Richard Nixon’s presi-
dency and move power to rank-and-file law-
makers. Many segregationist chairmen were
ousted and replaced by reformers, and com-
mittees and subcommittees were given flexi-
bility to study issues under their purview.
It’s no accident that some of the most sig-
nificant legislation and oversight by Con-
gress—Title IX; the Clean Water Act; the
Watergate, Pike and Church hearings—came
from this period. Congress had strengthened
its pillars, hired smart people and accessed
the best information available.
Following the reforms of the 1970s, the
House held some 6,000 hearings per year. But
eventually, the number of House hearings
fell—from a tick above 4,000 in 1994 to barely
more than 2,000 in 2014. On the tax-writing
Ways and Means Committee, of which I am a
member, oversight hearings are virtually
nonexistent, as is developing legislation. We
had no hearings in 2017 on the bill that would
dramatically rewrite our tax code. And in
the last Congress, we didn’t haul in any ad-
ministration officials for a single public
hearing on the renegotiation ofthe North
American Free Trade Agreement. Assessing
this state of affairs in a 2017 report, the Con-
gressional Management Foundation noted
that committees ‘‘have been meeting less
often than at almost any other time in re-
cent history.’’ This neglect has become the
norm. Instead, leadership, lobbyists and the
White House decide how to solve policy prob-
lems.
Indeed, Congress has allowed the White
House to dominate policymaking. Trade is a
perfect illustration. Despite our current
president’s braggadocio, most Americans
would be surprised to learn ultimate trade
power rests with Congress. But over and over
we’ve willingly, even eagerly, handed off
that responsibility given to us by Article I,
Section 8 of the Constitution. President
Trump’s power to renegotiate NAFTA was
granted by Congress, as was his power to
issue tariffs, allowed under the Trade Expan-
sion Act of 1962. I disagreed with the decision
in 2015 to give President Barack Obama—a
member of my own party—fast track power
to advance the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
During that debate, I sat stupefied as some
members of our committee sought to award
not only Obama but also future, unknown
executives an extended and open-ended au-
thority to make other deals. Congress was
prepared to simply abdicate our job.
Perhaps the most striking instance of po-
litical interference I’ve seen in my career oc-
curred in the Ways and Means Committee in
2014. Then-Chairman Dave Camp (R–Mich.)
had toiled for months with Democrats, Re-
publicans and budget experts to craft a com-
prehensive tax reform bill. I may not have
loved the final product, but I respected the
process. Republican leadership killed the
proposal almost immediately after it was un-
veiled. The reason? They wanted to deny
Obama a legislative accomplishment.
For decades, nearly every piece of legisla-
tion would reach the floor via committee,
but beginning in the 1990s, the rate began to
drop. In the 113th Congress, approximately 40
percent of big-ticket legislation bypassed
committees. Before 1994, Camp would have
informed the speaker of his proposal and
brought it to the floor. Now, a chairman has
much less power to realize meaningful legis-
lation. Meanwhile, longstanding House rules
have essentially blocked the amendment
process on the floor, meaning bills can’t be
modified by members of the wider chamber.
In addition to committee weakness, House
lawmakers collectively employ fewer staffers
today than they did in 1980. Between 1980 and
2016, when the U.S. population rose by nearly
97 million people and districts grew by 40
percent on average (about 200,000 people per
seat), the number of aides in House member
offices decreased, to 6,880, and total House
staff increased less than 1 percent, to 9,420.
The first lobe of Congress’s brain we can
bulk back up is the Congressional Research
Service. The CRS provides studies from tal-
ented experts spanning law, defense, trade,
science, industry and other realms. Some of
our greatest oversight triumphs—Watergate,
Iran-contra, the Freedom of information
Act—were achieved with the CRS’s support.
Great nations build libraries, and much of
the CRS is housed in the Library of
Congress’s Madison Building.
But the CRS has become a political target.
In 2012, a CRS report finding that tax cuts do
not generate revenue enraged my Republican
colleagues, who had the report pulled and
began browbeating CRS experts. According
to figures supplied by the CRS, the next
year, the service saw its funding cut by $5
million, nearly 5 percent, recovering to pre-
vious levels only in 2015. (The CRS did get
big funding bumps in recent years.)
The Congressional Budget Office and the
Government Accountability Office, crown
jewels of our body that provide nonpartisan
budget projections, are similarly ignored or
maligned for partisan purposes. Last year,
when the CBO debunked claims that the GOP
tax plan would create jobs, Republicans sav-
aged the agency instead of improving the
law. It reminded one of my colleagues, Rep.
Jim Himes (D–Conn.), of an episode of The
Simpsons’’ in which Springfield residents,
rescued from a hurtling comet, resolve to
raze the town observatory.
The GAO also furnishes rich information
to Congress on virtually any subject. Last
year I requested and obtained a study on the
live-events ticket market. It was a probing
report with fresh data. Former senator Tom
Coburn (R–Okla.), one of the most conserv-
ative lawmakers of the past generation,
praised the GAO, estimating that every dol-
lar of funding for the agency potentially
saved Americans $90. Nonetheless, from 1980
to 2015, GAO staffing was cut by one-fifth.
While I never had the pleasure of collabo-
rating with the Office of Technology Assess-
ment, its reputation is legendary. Like the
GAO, it operated as a think tank for Con-
gress, tasked with studying science and tech-
nology issues. The OTA was Congress’s only
agency solely conducting scholarly work on
these issues until Gingrich disemboweled it.
Today, few members of Congress know it
ever existed. The congressional hearings on
big tech showcased my colleagues’ inability
to wrap their heads around basic tech-
nologies. But our challenges don’t stop at
Silicon Valley. Biomedical research,
CRISPR, space exploration, artificial intel-
ligence, election security, self-driving cars
and, most pressingly, climate change are
also on Congress’s plate.
And we are functioning like an abacus
seeking to decipher string theory. By one es-
timate, the federal government spends $94
billion on information technology, while
Congress spends $0 on independent assess-
ments of technology issues. We are crying
out for help to guide our thinking on these
emerging areas. I have backed motions to
bring the OTA back to life, and I was heart-
ened last year when the House Appropria-
tions Committee approved funding for a
study on the feasibility of a new OTA.
The creation in the House rules of a Select
Committee for the Modernization of Con-
gress in this new I session is a terrific begin-
ning—and a signal that Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D–Calif.) and Rules Committee Chair-
man Jim McGovern (D–Mass.) understand
the importance of these issues. Providing
capital and staff to the institution should be
a major priority in the 116th Congress. The

budgets we approve fund 445 executive de-
partments, agencies, commissions and other
federal bodies. But for every $3,000 the
United States spends per American on gov-
ernment programs, we allocate only $6 to
oversee them.
After decades of disinvesting in itself, Con-
gress has become captured by outside inter-

IN RECOGNITION OF 100 YEARS OF
THE THIEL FAMILY REAL ES-
TATE AND AUCTION BUSINESS
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to acknowledge the 100-year anniver-
sary of Thiel family auctioneers. Started in
1919, the Thiel Real Estate and Auction busi-
ness still operates today in Northeast Wis-
consin.
100 years ago, Andrew Thiel started his
family auction business out of his home in
Chilton, Wisconsin. Continuing his father’s leg-
acy, Andrew’s son Randolph took over the
company until he retired at the age of 81. Fol-
lowing his retirement, Andrew’s son Jerry took
over and continued to expand the business
from auctions to also include the real estate
and appraisal businesses. Jerry joined the
Wisconsin Realtors Association and the Cal-
umet County Board of Realtors, where he
served as a board member and president for
many years. In 1988, Jerry Thiel was named
Calumet County Realtor of the Year, and is
currently a member of the Wisconsin Realtor
Honor Society.
The Thiel Real Estate and Auctions busi-
ness is the oldest family-owned business and
the largest appraisal business in Calumet
County. And, the family tradition continues
today. Fourth and fifth generation Thiel family
members, including Jerry’s four children and
many grandchildren, are actively involved in
the business.
This 100-year accomplishment is significant
and inspirational. The Thiel family exemplifies
the best qualities of Northeast Wisconsin and
I am proud to represent such a dedicated, in-
novative, and hardworking family.
Madam Speaker, I ask that the Members of
the House of Representatives join me in con-
gratulating the Thiel family for their 100 years
of success in Northeast Wisconsin.

HONORING ALEX TRISCHLER
HON. SAM GRAVES
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize Alex Trischler.
Alex is a very special young man who has ex-
emplified the finest qualities of citizenship and
leadership by taking an active part in the Boy
Scouts of America, Troop 1376, and earning
the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout.
Alex has been very active with his troop,
participating in many scout activities. Over the
many years Alex has been involved with
scouting, he has not only earned numerous
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Alex
has led his troop as a Patrol Leader, become
a Brotherhood member of the Order of the
Arrow, and holds the rank of Brave in the tribe
of Mic-O-Say. Alex has also contributed to his
community through his Eagle Scout project.
Alex created an extension and beautification
of a memorial garden for Second Baptist
Church in Liberty, Missouri. Alex and his fel-
low Scouts and Scouters donated 201 service
hours for this beautiful project.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join

HONORING JUDGE JOHN PAYTON
FOR HIS DEDICATED SERVICE
HON. VAN TAYLOR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Mr. John Edward Payton for his
twenty-eight years of dedicated service to
Collin County, Texas.
A graduate of Plano East Senior High
School in Collin County, Texas, John Payton
was first elected to the position of Collin Coun-
ty Justice of the Peace for Precinct 3 in 1990.
Payton had the distinction of serving as the
youngest ever elected Judge in Texas, an ac-
colade recognized in the Guinness Book of
World Records. John would go on to earn
Magna Cum Laude honors at Collin College,
where he would also achieve recognition for
his role on the USA TODAY Academic All-
American team and as a member of Phi Beta
Kappa International Honor Society.
His many contributions to our community in-
clude his mentorship of at-risk students who
benefitted from his steadfast leadership and
compassion. More than twenty years ago,
Payton realized the need to assist youth by
providing community service opportunities
through the creation of the Students on Serv-
ice Community Service Program. Countless
lives have been changed by the opportunities
presented for these youths to contribute to
their community in meaningful ways resulting
in an impressive 500,000 plus hours of service
to the community. Judge Payton would often
spend his weekends with students building
homes through Habitat for Humanity or teach-
ing local youth how to operate a farm or
greenhouse. John truly built communities in
the deepest sense.
Judge Payton’s contributions to the commu-
nity are numerous, earning him an array of
awards and recognitions from respected col-
leagues and organizations throughout Collin
County. On a personal level, John might tout
his greatest accomplishment as serving as a
loving husband to Shea and a proud father to
Katarina.
Judge John Payton’s servant leadership and
efforts to provide a constant and strong com-
munity support structure for our youth are to
be commended. He is particularly to be
praised for his unwavering belief that through
committed involvement with our youth, we can
build the future.
It has been an honor to know and work with
Mr. John Edward Payton over the years. As
Judge Payton begins this next chapter of his
life, I ask my colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating him for his selfless service to the
youth and residents of Collin County. Semper
Fidelis.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of the 100th Anniversary
of the Commissioners of the Revenue Asso-
ciation of Virginia, a well-reputed organization
that has spent the past century providing
counseling on tax policy and its application.
The Commissioners of Revenue began pro-
viding counsel to the Virginia General Assem-
bly, the Commonwealth, her agencies and de-
partments, and local governments on January
1, 1919. Since their formation, they have
played an integral role in the history of Vir-
ginia, being involved in both the registration of
our Commonwealth’s first female voters and
their support for the elimination of segregation
within real and personal property tax assess-
ment books.
The Virginia Commissioners of Revenue is
made up of 127 individuals who are the chief
assessing officers of their localities. They do
irreplaceable work assessing property values,
issuing business licenses, state income tax fil-
ing assistance, as well as further work within
their respective areas. They serve as invalu-
able resources for the citizens of Virginia’s
First District, and I cannot thank them enough
for the hard work they do every day.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
recognizing the 100th Anniversary of the Com-
missioners of the Revenue Association of Vir-
ginia. I proudly thank the men and women
who serve as Virginia’s Commissioners for
their dedication to our Commonwealth and
their work. May God bless the operations of
the Commissioners of the Revenue Associa-
tion of Virginia, and I look forward to seeing
their continued excellence.

RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE
TODD RICHARDSON
HON. JASON SMITH
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate the Honorable Todd
Richardson on being named the Poplar Bluff
Chamber of Commerce’s Citizen of the Year.
I had the honor of serving alongside Todd in
the Missouri State House and have grown to
admire and respect him dearly.
Todd became Speaker of the Missouri
House in 2015, leading the chamber and state
during a tumultuous time. He passed sweep-
ing tax reform legislation, making Missouri
more competitive economically. He also
passed historic legislation protecting the un-
born and Missourians’ 2nd Amendment rights,
while overseeing a rewrite of harassment poli-
cies in Missouri’s Capitol. All of these accom-
plishments were done while carrying himself
with dignity and integrity, garnering the utmost
respect from members on both sides of the
aisle. Todd was the right person in the right
position at the right time to lead our state
through some significant times of uncertainty.
Todd was recently selected by Governor
Parsons to be the Director of MO HealthNet.
He is already making an imprint by leading an
effort to root out fraud and prevent waste
while providing accessible, quality healthcare
to all Missourians.
Todd is a man of great character, who
sought for his tenure in the Missouri State
House to be consistent with his moral and per-
sonal values, or as he put it ‘‘to be the same
person when I leave as I was when I arrived.’’
And Madam Speaker, he has done just that.
On behalf of the Eighth Congressional District
of Missouri, it is my great privilege to recog-
nize a true gentleman from Butler County,
Todd Richardson.

HONORING THOMAS LOYD AND

HON. SAM GRAVES

Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize Thomas Loyd
and Jane Pansing Brown on earning the
Northlanders of the Year Award from the
Northland Regional Chamber of Commerce.
Tom and Jane have been exemplary and
historic community members for the Kansas
City Northland and their achievements cannot
be overstated. Tom has not only served as a
Clay County Commissioner and Chairman of
the Missouri Lottery Commission, but also for
30 years at Saint Luke’s North Hospital, most
recently as Chairman of the Board. Tom has
also served on boards for the Mid-America
Regional Council, Tri-County Mental Health,
and Synergy Services, among others, while
also advocating for the Northland within Con-
gress as a member of my staff for the past 13
years.
Jane has also left her mark on the North-
land community. As a young attorney, Jane
was barred from the courtroom due to her
pregnancy. By the time Jane was pregnant
with their third child, Jane was serving as the
first female judge in Clay County history. She
served on the North Kansas City School
Board, an organization she remains involved
with, but most notably has served as an as-
sistant United States Attorney since 2002. Her
work for the Department of Justice includes a
year as the Assistant Program Director at the
National Advocacy Center, responsible for
planning the continuing legal education class-
es for all 13,000 federal prosecutors and De-
partment of Justice staff.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me, their three children, four grandchildren,
and many friends and colleagues in com-
mending Thomas Loyd and Jane Pansing
Brown for their accomplishments and for their
efforts put forth in bettering the Northland.

Throughout his career, Chief Bynum held

IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT THE
DOMINICAN FILM QUÉ LEÓN
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, Qué
León is a Dominican film directed by Frank
Perozo, produced by Caribbean Cinemas and
its executive producers Gregory Quinn, Mi-
chael Carrady and Zumaya Cordero, which
shows, with humor, how love can survive all
adversities.
Qué León, for its quality, represents a con-
tribution to the Dominican filmography.
Qué León surpassed all expectations by
mobilizing more than 600,000 people in its first
eight weeks in markets such as the Dominican
Republic, Puerto Rico, and more than eight
Caribbean islands and Bolivia.
In addition, it is the first Dominican film with
a massive premiere in North American territory
in more than 13 states, around 35 cities and
more than 70 cinemas, which sets a prece-
dent for Dominican industry in U.S. territory.
What León is about the life of Nicole and
José Miguel, who have one thing in common:
their last name León. But they come from very
different social backgrounds, and their love will
have to deal with the opposition of their par-
ents and with a large number of situations that
will put them to the test.
Qué León has a cast of prominent Domini-
can and Puerto Rican actors and actresses,
including singer Ozuna, Clarissa Molina (win-
ner of the reality show Nuestra Belleza Latina
in 2016, who also makes her film debut), and
experienced kings of the Dominican comedy
Raymond Pozo and Miguel Céspedes.
Qué León also includes in its cast important
figures of theater, film and television, such as
Celinés Toribio, Stephany Liriano, Milagros
German, Irving Alberti, Anyelina Sánchez,
Roger Wasserman, Oscar Carrasquillo, Candy
Flow, the salsars Vı́ctor Manuelle and Alex
Matos and the Puerto Ricans Jorge Pabón
‘‘Molusco’’ and Jaime Mayol.

estreno masivo en territorio norteamericano
en más de 13 estados, alrededor de 35
ciudades y más de 70 salas, lo que establece
un precedente para la industria dominicana

sociales muy diferentes, y su amor tendrá

family. Regrettably Mr. Garcia passed away
on October 28, 2018 in Santa Ana, California
at the age of 76 years old.

to the United States in 1962 as a member of
the Bracero Program and worked as a farm
worker in Arizona and California. He eventu-
ally made his way to Los Angeles where he
attended community college to learn English.
In 1964 he moved to Santa Ana where he
bought two homes. He became an imperative
resource to his family and friends arriving from
Mexico, providing them with temporary shelter,
food and helping them find jobs.
As a member of the Santa Ana Actors Club
of the Yost Theater, he helped bring Spanish-
speaking theater to the growing Latino com-
munity in Santa Ana by acting and writing
screen plays and poems. He began working
as a laborer in 1966 and was a proud card-
carrying member of the Laborers’ International
Union of North America, Local 652, for more
than 50 years. During his 23 years as a la-
borer, he worked on many construction
projects throughout Southern California, in-
cluding numerous expansions to the Interstate
5 freeway and building the Indiana Jones Ad-
venture ride at Disneyland Park in Anaheim.
Mr. Garcia was married in 1971, to Reyna
Silvia, and together they had eight children:
Leticia, Patricia, Alma, Elvira, Rosalva, Carlos,
David, and Teresa. He was also the father to
Johnny and the grandfather to 13 grand-
children.
After nearly 30 years in the United States,
he was inspired to become a citizen as a re-
sult of the anti-immigrant sentiment in Cali-
fornia in the 1990s. He was proud to become
a U.S. citizen on March 9, 1999, and quickly
registered to vote as a Democrat. He made
sure he voted in every election, and took pride
to learn about all candidates, local measures,
and statewide propositions to make sure he
made informed decisions.
Manuel was also very proud of his Mexican
nationality, and frequently visited El
Cargadero—a small town in the state of
Zacatecas. He was instrumental in helping
build a health clinic, a library with computers,
a funeral home, and update the elementary
school. For nearly four decades, he partnered
with many Mexican government officials to fur-
ther help improve his hometown. He spear-
headed projects to build a bridge, expand the
central plaza, build a new townhall, public
restrooms, a new baseball stadium, and im-
prove local infrastructure.
Manuel was also an avid baseball fan. He
was a loyal fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers
and the Los Angeles Angels. He played rec-
reational baseball for many years with his
brothers, and as a parent coached many
teams for the Santa Ana Little League. In his
retirement years, he worked part-time as a
janitor at the Los Angeles Angels stadium
while enjoying a good game—the best of two
worlds.
Mr. Garcia was a generous man who con-
tinuously found ways to give back to his com-
munity. His generosity reached hundreds of
people and will be missed by friends and fam-
ily. Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize
Manuel U. Garcia.

Charlie ‘‘Chief’’ Ings spent nearly thirty
years with the Orlando Police Department. He
was a trailblazer in every sense of the word,
serving as one of OPD’s first black police offi-
cers and serving as the first black detective.
Charlie Ings’ commitment was real, his dedi-
cation fierce, and his perseverance unwaver-
ing. Before joining the police department, he
spent seven years with Orlando’s Recreation
Division. While walking a different type of
beat, he mentored children and teenagers and
stood as a strong role model and source of
strength and inspiration for his community.
By the time he joined the Orlando Police
Department, he was called a ‘‘walking ency-
clopedia’’ of West Orlando’s families by his
peers. What came naturally to Charlie Ings is
today known as ‘‘community-oriented polic-
ing.’’ Simply put, he always put service above
self. The community trusted him, and that
meant getting calls and tips to fill in crucial de-
tails on unsolved cases.
He worked long nights and cold mornings,
broke up crime rings and built lifelong friend-
ships. He was married to his wife Pearl for
thirty years and was father to six children. One
of his children, Commissioner Samuel Ings,
followed in his footsteps by joining the Orlando
Police Department.
What Charlie ‘‘Chief’’ Ings’ former col-
leagues remember about him is his character.
His integrity was renowned, and he treated ev-
eryone with dignity and respect. He was an of-
ficer and a gentleman and leaves an exem-
plary roadmap for others to follow. He will be
remembered by his family, his friends, former
colleagues, and a grateful community.

IN HONOR OF LOREN FELDNER,
D.D.S.
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the memory of a dear friend and loving
father, whose unquestioned patriotism and life-
long service to others will be sorely missed.
The world lost a great man when my friend,
Dr. Loren J. Feldner, D.D.S. went to be with
the Lord on January 17, 2019. Dr. Feldner
was more than just a leader in his profession;
he was a force for good in the world. His col-
leagues will remember a true advocate of the
dental field, someone who served faithfully
through his state dental society and the Amer-
ican Dental Association. After hours, he volun-
teered his professional expertise, working with
underprivileged communities and veterans.
This passion for others was evident through
his care and treatment for patients, which was
second to none.
Outside of the office, Dr. Feldner was a de-
voted family man who chased the fullest life
the world could offer. Loren spent his free time
piloting his boat, driving race cars, and trav-
eling the world with his daughter Alexandra
and his love, Terry Park. His laugh was con-
tagious to all who encountered him, and he
genuinely cared about every single person
who crossed his path. Loren served people
with the same passion with which he served
God. His generosity had no bounds, and I will
certainly miss our friendship.
I will continue to pray for the Feldner family
through this difficult time. Loren’s legacy on
Earth will be long-lasting, and it brings me
peace knowing my friend is finally home.
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to
remember Dr. Loren Feldner. May God bless
his family and all those he leaves behind.

HOW THE TRUMP SHUTDOWN
HURTS HOUSTON RESERVIST
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 24, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, Edith
Banda a constituent who lives in Houston re-
cently returned from a reservist deployment in
the Middle East. She is among thousands of
people in the Houston area feeling the impact
of the government shutdown.
Edith has not worked her federal job in
downtown Houston since the shutdown 25
days ago.
Making matters worse, she and dozens of
others in Houston are unable to seek tem-
porary private sector work because such jobs
require permission, and the people who proc-
ess those requests have been furloughed.
Edith has begun selling her personal pos-
sessions to make ends meet, but she said an-
other couple of weeks of no work would be
crushing.
