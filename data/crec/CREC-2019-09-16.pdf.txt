PRAYER
Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Cap-
itol Worship, Washington, D.C., offered
the following prayer:
Merciful Father, in times like these,
we need Your Holy Spirit to refresh us,
cleanse us. In times like these, we need
Your word revealed to heal us. In times
like these, we need Your prophet to
speak, ‘‘This is the way, walk ye in it.’’
In times like these, we need our sins,
which are many, washed in Your blood.
In times like these, we need reminding
that before Your throne there is no
party, no race, no gender, no saint—
just sinners saved by grace. In times
like these, we need reminding that wis-
dom is not debated, it comes through
fearing You. In times like these, when
we feel victimized by our cir-
cumstances, let us become more than
conquerors through Christ who
strengthens us.
And yes, in times like these, when we
see so many around us in desperation,
remind us one more time, we are our
brother’s keeper.
In Jesus’ name I pray, amen.

The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Holy God, who loves all and forgets
none, thank You for the guidance of
Your sacred words, a light for dark
times.
Lord, we are grateful You provide
wisdom for those who revere You. Send
help and strength to our lawmakers,
that they may strive to honor You in
every endeavor. Inspire them to mount
up on wings like eagles, running with-
out weariness and walking without
fainting. Lord, give them the wisdom
to have a conscience void of offense to-
ward You and humanity.
Eternal God, hear our intercessions,
answer them according to Your will,
and make us all channels of Your
mercy and love.
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the

IOWA V. IOWA STATE FOOTBALL
GAME
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this
weekend I attended what some call
Iowa’s own Super Bowl, the Iowa v.
Iowa State football game. I talked with
Iowans while tailgating, and tailgating
most of the time goes on before the
game for me. We talked about issues
such as ethanol, biodiesel, and trade.
This year, the game was in Ames,
and Iowa State hosted ESPN’s football
‘‘College GameDay,’’ and this was the
first time ever for Iowans to do that. It
was an opportunity to show off Iowa
State’s campus and to celebrate the
tradition of the annual Cy-Hawk game.
Congratulations to the Iowa Hawk-
eyes for winning this year’s match-up,
but both teams put up a strong fight,
as you can tell from the final score of
Iowa’s winning 18 to 17.
I yield the floor.

f
SAUDI ARABIA
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this
weekend saw a brazen attack by Iran
on a critical oil facility in Saudi Ara-
bia. This is not just an isolated drone
strike with the prospect of regional es-
calation but an attack with significant
repercussions for the entire global en-
ergy market.
We are fortunate that advances in
U.S. oil and gas production have made
the United States more energy inde-
pendent and have added capacity to
global markets, but the impact of this
attack could still be substantial. For
this reason, I welcome the administra-
tion’s preparations to potentially re-
lease oil from our Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, if needed, to stabilize global
markets. I hope our international part-
ners will join us in imposing con-
sequences on Tehran for this reckless,
destabilizing attack.
f
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now
on another matter, when the Senate re-
turned last week, we anticipated our
top priority would be conducting the
appropriations process and avoiding a
lapse in government funding. We had a
clear roadmap, a bipartisan, bicameral
agreement negotiated by the Presi-
dent’s team and the Speaker of the
House. It set top-line funding targets
for both defense and nondefense, and it
laid out ground rules to protect the
process from partisan politics.
There has actually been reason for
optimism. This week, we hope to move
to the House-passed bills for Defense,
Energy and Water, Labor-HHS, and
State and Foreign Ops. This would be
our first procedural step to getting the
process moving for all of our priorities
on both sides.
There is nothing controversial about
this particular grouping of bills. In
fact, it was Speaker PELOSI who com-
bined this grouping of bills to move
first. Furthermore, if any of the fund-
ing measures were going to be handled
earnestly across party lines, surely it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

ought to be the bill funding the Depart-
ment of Defense. Our fundamental obli-
gation is to provide for the common de-
fense of our country, and all Members
feel our responsibility to keep the Na-
tion safe.
Fortunately, the caps agreement spe-
cifically allows us to increase defense
funding to meet the growing threats
our Nation faces. Yet here is where we
are: One week in, our Democratic col-
leagues tried to stonewall the defense
funding bill in committee and are now
indicating they may even filibuster a
motion to begin considering the House-
passed defense funding bill later this
week.
There is only one way to read this.
Some of our Democratic colleagues
have determined they would rather
stage a political fight with President
Trump than secure the resources that
our uniformed commanders urgently
need to do their jobs. National security
is taking a back seat to partisan poli-
tics.
Let’s be absolutely clear about the
concerns and the priorities that our
Democratic friends are de-prioritizing.
The defense spending measure would
bolster efforts to modernize our forces
and build the U.S. military of the fu-
ture. Russia is actively modernizing its
own forces, just as we have seen the
Putin regime step up its brazen steps
to exert its destabilizing influence well
beyond its borders. In China, the last
decade has seen military spending
nearly double. Our regional partners
continue to feel the tightening grip of
the Chinese Communist Party on trade
and strategic activity throughout the
Indo-Pacific region while the techno-
logical ripples of Chinese cyber med-
dling are felt right here at home.
In the face of surging great-power ad-
versaries, simple upkeep is not enough
to keep America and our allies safe
from aggression. Comprehensive fund-
ing for research, development, and
readiness programs is what is needed.
In Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia,
Yemen, and beyond, we continue to
face sustained threats from terrorist
organizations. In the Middle East, we
have seen how Iran’s bid for regional
hegemony and its investment in terror,
missiles, and cyber activities threaten
the United States, our allies and part-
ners, key shipping lanes, and global en-
ergy markets.
This bipartisan Defense bill would
help us to adapt to meet these new
threats while ensuring our com-
manders can prosecute existing oper-
ations without being consumed by the
instability of short-term continuing
resolutions. Yet our Democratic col-
leagues would rather provoke a par-
tisan feud with the President. They
would rather have a fight with the
President than stick to the agreement
we all made. At least that is where we
are as of the moment.
I remain hopeful that my friends on
the Democratic side will join us in hon-
oring the terms of the agreement that
has been struck by the President and
the Speaker and help us to reboot a bi-
partisan funding process. The readiness
and modernization of America’s mili-
tary and the safety of the American
people should not play second fiddle to
our Democratic colleagues’ political
strategy.
f
BRETT KAVANAUGH
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
a completely different matter, for any-
body who has been reading the news
over the past few days, it has probably
felt a little like Groundhog Day be-
cause over the last couple of days, lead-
ing Democrats have tried to grab on to
yet another poorly sourced, thinly re-
ported, unsubstantiated allegation
against Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
There they go again. Call it a 1-year
anniversary reenactment with Senate
Democrats reopening the sad and em-
barrassing chapter they wrote last Sep-
tember.
The latest allegation was blasted out
by a major newspaper despite the ap-
parent lack of any corroborating evi-
dence whatsoever. The reporting was so
thin that the story ran not in the news
section but on the opinion page. In
fact, they have already had to issue an
enormous correction. The writers con-
veniently failed to note that the sup-
posed victim herself declined to be
interviewed, and several of her friends
say she has no memory of any such
thing happening.
We all remember this pattern from
the last time around: Shoot first, and
correct the facts later. Here is another
familiar pattern: Just like last Sep-
tember, little things like facts and evi-
dence didn’t stop the Democrats from
rushing to exploit this. Even as the
media was trying to backpedal, a num-
ber of the Democratic Presidential can-
didates were hysterically calling for
Justice Kavanaugh to be impeached on
the basis of this flimsy, uncorroborated
story. They were calling for Justice
Kavanaugh to be impeached. That in-
cludes several of our own Senate col-
leagues. Even after the massive correc-
tion, no one in that group has backed
off his ridiculous threat.
This laughable suggestion is already
earning scorn throughout the country
and across the political spectrum. A
majority of Senators and the American
people rightly rejected the politics of
unsubstantiated personal destruction
just last year. It is just as transparent
and self-serving today, 1 year later.
Yet it would be a mistake to dismiss
this as a bad case of sour grapes. This
is not just a leftwing obsession with
one man; it is part of a deliberate ef-
fort to attack judicial independence.
Six of the Democratic Presidential
candidates—plus one who has now quit
to run for the Senate—have publicly
flirted with packing the Supreme
Court—Court packing. Today’s bold,
new Democratic idea is a failed power
grab from back in the 1930s.
Just a few weeks ago, some Senate
Democrats nakedly threatened the Su-
preme Court Justices in writing. Our
colleagues sent the Court an out-
landish brief, gravely intoning that the
‘‘Supreme Court is not well,’’ they
said. ‘‘The Supreme Court is not well.’’
Here was the punch line: Either issue
rulings we like or we will pack the
Court.
This is not normal political behavior.
These are the actions of a political
party whose agenda is so alien to the
Constitution that it feels threatened
by fair and faithful judges.
This is what I would say: When the
simple notion that judges should be
faithful to the Constitution looks like
an attack on your agenda, maybe it is
your agenda that needs a makeover,
not our independent judiciary. When
you are this willing to launch unhinged
personal attacks, you reveal a whole
lot more about your own radicalism
than about the men and women you
target.
This is my commitment and the com-
mitment of all of my Republican col-
leagues: As long as we remain in the
Senate, we will fight to preserve our
fair and independent judiciary.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
DAINES). Without objection, it is so or-

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before
I begin, I just want to comment on the
Republican leader’s remarks.
I listened to Leader MCCONNELL’s re-
marks about the appropriations proc-
ess. He accused Democrats of wanting
to provoke a partisan fight with the
President rather than fund our mili-
tary.
It was a bold accusation considering
that it was the President and the Re-
publican majority on the Appropria-
tions Committee who proposed taking
funding from the military to spend on
the President’s wall. That is what
Democrats oppose. That is what Leader
MCCONNELL called staging a political
fight.
Across the country we see commu-
nities, military bases, and people in the
military saying: Taking away this
money hurts us. All Democrats are
asking for is to protect the troops from
having their resources robbed for a bor-
der wall—resources that Congress said
should go to the military. By the way,
the President promised Mexico would
pay for the wall. Let’s not forget that.
In March, 12 Republicans voted with
us to reject the President’s proposal.
That is a lot in a place where people
fear the President and don’t like to
buck him. The real question is, Will
the rest join us now? That is the issue.
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Mr. President, on guns and the trage-
dies that have occurred in the last 6
weeks, it has been over 6 weeks since
President Trump, in the aftermath of
two tragic mass shootings, signaled
that he would be supportive of expand-
ing background checks. It has been
over 200 days—201, I believe—since the
House of Representatives passed a bi-
partisan bill that would strengthen
background checks in the most com-
prehensive way. Yet, despite those two
facts, we still have no idea what policy
President Trump might support.
Yesterday, at the request of Speaker
PELOSI and me, we held a phone call
with the President to urge him to sup-
port the bipartisan, House-passed uni-
versal background checks bill and to
make that position public. We are cer-
tainly willing to discuss the finer
points of legislation with our Repub-
lican colleagues, but we have made one
thing clear to the President: The effec-
tiveness of gun safety measures will be
severely compromised if we allow the
loopholes in our background check sys-
tem to remain intact.
For example, it has been widely re-
ported that the President is consid-
ering legislation dealing with Extreme
Risk Protection Orders, ERPOs, as part
of the response to last month’s horrific
shootings. I support ERPOs and believe
they can be an important piece of a
broader effort to prevent gun violence.
But even if we pass a strong bill on
ERPOs, someone prohibited from pos-
sessing a gun under an Extreme Risk
Protection Order could still obtain a
firearm by exploiting the gun show
loophole and the online loophole.
Let’s say a family member of John X.
Smith says that he doesn’t deserve to
have a gun. They go through the proper
procedure, and they say he can’t have a
gun or they take a gun that he has
away from him. In the next minute,
the same John X. Smith can go online
and get a gun. There will be no check
on him, so he will get it, or he can go
to a gun show and do that.
Without background checks, these
other things virtually become get-
aroundable: A bad guy who shouldn’t
have a gun finds a way to get around
them, taking advantage of the loop-
holes that now exist in the law.
We have to do background checks.
That is at the base of all of this—back-
ground checks that close all of the
loopholes. Allowing law-abiding Ameri-
cans to have guns, that is the Second
Amendment. But saying that felons,
those adjudicated mentally ill, and
spousal abusers can’t, everyone—90
percent of America—agrees with that.
In the wake of the torrent of mass
shootings, in the wake of alarming
rates of gun violence on a daily basis,
our goal should not be to pass some-
thing just to pass something. We have
a responsibility, bestowed upon us by
the American people, to do something
meaningful to address the epidemic of
gun violence in our country, to save
American lives, and to save as many
lives as possible, the Senate must con-
sider the bipartisan universal back-
ground checks bill.
This is a critical moment for Presi-
dent Trump and for the Nation. The
President can provide the kind of lead-
ership on this issue that his party has
lacked for decades. He can break the
vice grip the NRA has held by congres-
sional Republicans by supporting a pol-
icy that well over 90 percent of all
Americans already support. Such a
commitment would undeniably be pop-
ular; it would be historic; and, most
important, it would save countless
lives.
Speaker PELOSI and I told the Presi-
dent that if he endorsed this legislation
and got Leader MCCONNELL to act on
it, we would be happy to join him in
the Rose Garden for the signing cere-
mony.
On the other hand, the President
could cave to the NRA yet again this
week and announce he is supporting
only the kinds of policies that will not
offend them—policies that will not
make a real dent in the problem.
The American people have waited
long enough for Congress to do some-
thing about the decades-long night-
mare of gun violence that seems to get
worse and worse. The President can
choose, this week, to help break the
deadlock—the courageous and correct
move—or he can slink away and per-
petuate the status quo.
CHINA TELECOM
Mr. President, on another issue,
China telecom, I have spent a lot of
time on the Senate floor talking about
the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and
the threat it poses to our national and
economic security. This afternoon, I
want to inform my colleagues about
similar concerns I have about two
other major Chinese companies: China
Telecom and China Unicom. Alongside
China Mobile, these three companies
are the big three of China’s govern-
ment-owned and government-con-
trolled telecommunications network.
Earlier this year, the FCC rejected an
application by China Mobile to operate
in the United States on national secu-
rity grounds. The Commission issued a
200-page opinion outlining the various
security risks of a state-owned Chinese
company operating on U.S. networks.
That made sense. But at the same
time, it turns out that both China
Telecom and China Unicom, the other
two major Chinese telecom giants,
were granted authorization to operate
in the United States in the early 2000s.
So today, Senator COTTON, a Repub-
lican from Arkansas, and I, a Democrat
from New York, are sending a letter to
the FCC, urging them to review and, if
warranted, revoke those authorizations
on national security grounds. If China
Mobile shouldn’t operate here, it seems
that neither should China Telecom and
China Unicom.
These approvals were issued well over
15 years ago, before the Department of
Homeland Security even existed. In
that same time, the national security
environment has changed dramati-
cally. The Chinese Government has
conducted a vicious and predatory
campaign of cyber hostilities all over
the world, including intrusions and
hacks of prominent American compa-
nies and American institutions. The
facts that these two telecom companies
are controlled by the Chinese Com-
munist Party and have access to our
networks seem to be very serious prob-
lems. At the very least, the FCC should
open a proceeding to review these com-
panies and, if necessary, revoke their
access.
Senator COTTON and I, as everyone in
this Chamber knows, don’t see eye to
eye on many issues, but on this one we
are in complete agreement. We must be
really careful about the national secu-
rity risks posed by China’s key telecom
companies.
I think Senator COTTON would also
agree with the larger point I have been
making for months about U.S. access
to China’s markets. If China doesn’t let
American businesses compete fairly in
its markets, why should we let Chinese
companies compete in ours?
Reciprocity is the real answer to the
dilemma of China not being fair to us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5488 September 16, 2019
They don’t let our top-notch companies
in or let them in under such restraints
that many of them don’t want to come
in or can’t operate effectively or have
to surrender their family jewels, their
intellectual property, to Chinese com-
panies.
If that is the case, and it is, why do
we just let any Chinese company come
in here, particularly when they might
be a real national security risk? Chi-
na’s telecom companies have 10 ‘‘points
of presence’’ in North American net-
works. Do you know how many Amer-
ican companies have the same in
China? Zero. China Telecom gets ac-
cess to our networks, but T-Mobile or
any other American telecom company
can’t operate in China. Enough of that.
Enough of that. Enough of China try-
ing to take advantage of us. We sort of
sit there and do not do anything to pro-
tect our workers, our wealth, and the
great kinds of ideas Americans come
up with in terms of intellectual prop-
erty.
This isn’t just a question of fairness.
It is a question of which nation will
lead the world in these industries in
the coming decades, creating jobs and
wealth. I want America to lead. Our
businesses need to be able to compete
equally and fairly. I am confident, if
there were a level playing field, Amer-
ica would prevail, and we would stay
the leading economy in the world. If we
continue to let China take advantage
of us while we sit there with our hands
folded, woe is us—and particularly for
our children and our grandchildren.
I conclude by reminding the Trump
administration that in the ongoing
trade negotiations with Beijing, where
the President has been tougher on
China than either of the previous two
administrations—and that is a good
thing—the topic of reciprocity and fair
market access should be front and cen-
ter, and we shouldn’t give in until we
are treated fairly.

BRETT KAVANAUGH
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last
year, we on the Judiciary Committee
conducted an incredibly thorough re-
view of a nominee to the Supreme
Court of the United States. We dug
into Justice Kavanaugh’s personal and
professional life and discussed concerns
openly in front of the public.
Allegations were raised against the
Justice, but none could be corroborated
or verified. I know about this because I
had a team of dozens of lawyers and in-
vestigators chasing down each allega-
tion we received. My team spoke to 45
individuals and took 25 written state-
ments.
Anyone can review the 415-page in-
vestigation summary report that I re-
leased last November. We laid out the
information we received, including
some of the ugliest of claims. In the
end, there was no credible evidence to
support any of the allegations. Brett
Kavanaugh then was duly confirmed to
the Supreme Court by this body, as
prescribed in the Constitution.
Now, fast forward to this past week-
end, and the issues that I and a lot of
other Members of the Senate are being
asked about this very day, just as if
there is nothing else going on in this
town, but you dig up something that
happened a year ago.
The New York Times published a
book excerpt about Justice
Kavanaugh’s younger days that has
fueled a very fresh rumor from some-
one whose friends claim contacted Sen-
ators on the committee. That person,
Mr. Stier, didn’t reach out or provide
information to the committee’s major-
ity. Apparently, he also didn’t provide
any information to these writers. It is
only on the word of two anonymous
sources that his name and accusation
come up in this story in the New York
Times.
Again, my office never received any-
thing from Mr. Stier or his unnamed
friends, and we never received an alle-
gation against Kavanaugh like the one
referenced in the report over this week-
end. After interviewing eight people re-
lated to the Ramirez allegations, not
once was Mr. Stier’s name mentioned.
Had my staff received substantive alle-
gations or had he approached me or my
staff, we would have attempted to take
a statement and interview him. But
the alleged victim, who also didn’t
speak to these writers, apparently,
does not recall the incident. That is a
point that the New York Times failed
to include in its initial coverage.
Now, it happens that accountability
is a cornerstone of democracy. I wel-
come scrutiny of my work. I frequently
refer to reporters and journalists as the
police of our democratic system, but
today I am reminded of a very old
adage: Who will watch the watchmen?
This weekend’s report included some
embarrassing and irresponsible
missteps. They are mistakes that war-
rant serious self-reflection.
A year ago, after the interviews with
dozens of people, the New York Times
couldn’t even corroborate the allega-
tions laid out by Ms. Ramirez and de-
clined to report on them. With nothing
but a year of time and another inter-
view with Ramirez herself, the paper
thought those unverified claims were
suddenly worth printing—no more cor-
roboration and no more verification.
Coming only days before the release of
the author’s book, I can’t help but won-
der if the timing had something to do
with the decision to run the story.
Maybe it was to sell more books.
They also laid out what commenta-
tors are now calling a new allegation.
Let me be clear. This is not an allega-
tion. It is barely a third-hand rumor.
These writers—can you believe this?—
didn’t even speak to the man who they
claim originally recounted this rumor.
What is left are only layers and layers
of decades-old hearsay—no more cor-
roboration, no more verification, and
not even anything from the accuser
himself, and, most importantly, noth-
ing from the person who was allegedly
involved.
Now, the most shameful piece of this
episode is that it took more than a full
day, after publication, for the editors
to intervene and to provide critical
context. An editor’s note added to the
story last night reads: ‘‘The book re-
ports that the female student declined
to be interviewed and friends say that
she does not recall the incident.’’
Let me quote again: ‘‘ . . . she does
not recall the incident.’’ That is the al-
leged victim. That is the opposite of
corroboration and verification. In the
legal world, this sort of thing is called
exculpatory information. When it is
not laid bare to provide greater con-
text, it creates a serious credibility
problem.
In this case, the New York Times
withheld crucial facts that undercut its
own reporting. We now have an
uncorroborated accusation, rooted only
in unnamed sources, with no direct
knowledge of the event and that the al-
leged victim doesn’t even remember.
Now, you know about the New York
Times. Their slogan is that they only
print what is ‘‘fit to print.’’ I just de-
scribed this situation of no corrobora-
tion rooted in an unnamed source with-
out direct knowledge of this event and
that the alleged victim doesn’t even re-
member.
Now, to get back to the slogan of the
newspaper, when did this stuff I de-
scribed become something ‘‘fit to
print’’ by the supposed American paper
of record?
The sad consequences of this article
are a misinformed public, a greater di-
vide in our own discourse, and a deeper
lack of faith in our news media.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

and Plenipotentiary of the United
States of America to the United Arab

UNITED AUTO WORKERS STRIKE
Mr. BROWN. Today I hope my col-
leagues will join me in standing in soli-
darity with thousands of UAW workers
in Ohio and around the country. Work-
ers are going without their paychecks
today because they are demanding
General Motors respect the work they
do which has made this company so
successful.
All workers have the right to stand
up for fair pay and benefits, for better
working conditions, and for a voice in
their company. Let’s be clear. The
autoworkers, shall we say, are the en-
gine behind GM’s success. GM wouldn’t
be making a dime of profit without the
workers who actually make their cars
and trucks. Autoworkers stood up and
made sacrifices to help GM when times
were tough.
The Presiding Officer was a Member
of the House then, and I was a Member
of the Senate. We saw what happened
during the rescue of the auto industry
and how much those workers gave up
to save this industry. We remember the
depths of the recession. We remember
when President Obama took office as
800,000 were losing their jobs the first
month and 700,000 the second month
until, with the auto rescue, House
Democrats, with President Obama,
turned this economy around. We have
seen, literally, economic growth each
quarter over the last 10 years. This
was, in large part, because so many
workers, like the UAW workers, were
willing to give up something at the
bargaining table.
In some cases, clearly, some people
in this town wanted to abandon that
company. Now that times are better,
all the workers are asking for is their
fair share. So far, GM has not treated
these workers as the critical partners
they are in our auto industry.
Look at what GM has done in my
State. Look at what they did in
Lordstown, OH. The company shut
down its most productive plant in
North America, by GM’s own measure-
ments. The Lordstown plant near
Youngstown, OH, as recently as 21⁄2
years ago—back during the Obama ad-
ministration—had 4,500 workers work-
ing there. Even though President
Trump said: Don’t sell your homes;
these jobs are coming back, they have
been laid off—hundreds of workers,
4,500 over the last couple years. At the
same time, GM announced they were
going to build the Chevy Blazer in Mex-
ico.
GM could retool that Lordstown
plant, and they could build the Blazer
in Ohio. They could put some of their
electric vehicles in the Lordstown
plant in Ohio. We know they have plen-
ty of money to work with. They earned
higher than expected profits in the
first quarter of this year. President
Trump’s tax cuts for the rich gave huge
amounts of tax breaks to General Mo-
tors. Much of the money went to Gen-
eral Motors’ executives. All these
workers are asking for is to share in
those profits, have a voice in their
company.
GM made the decision to close
Lordstown and other plants around the
country with no input from the work-
ers who earned those profits for that
company. Now workers are standing up
and fighting for increased investments
in their local communities.
I spoke this week with Gary Jones,
the international president of the
United Auto Workers, about Lordstown
and bringing these jobs back. That is
what they are trying to win at the bar-
gaining table.
We know strikes are always a last re-
sort for workers. My wife grew up in
Ashtabula, OH. Her dad carried a union
card, Utility Workers of America. He
did maintenance for that plant for
more than 30 years. Twice when she
was growing up they went on strike.
She knows, as workers know, they
never get back what they lose in a
strike. So when they strike, it is when
their backs are against the wall. The
wife of one GM worker posted online
this week: ‘‘I can only pray this strike
is short.’’
These workers want to do their jobs.
They want to work. They don’t want to
be on the picket line. They want to
reach a solution that honors their
work.
GM needs to agree to a contract that
honors the dignity of work and recog-
nizes autoworkers, the communities,
and the families who are affected by
this and who helped drive the success
of the auto industry in Ohio and across
the country.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. President, once again, the Trump
administration is trying to take
healthcare away from people.
I will never forget. I was sitting at
this desk on the Senate floor the night
when Senators MURKOWSKI, COLLINS,
and McCain voted against repealing the
Affordable Care Act. I watched my col-
leagues—all of whom have good health
insurance—all of us have good health
insurance because of taxpayers. I
watched my colleagues, one after an-
other after another, vote to take
health insurance away from millions of
people. There are 900,000 people in my
State alone who have insurance now
because of the Affordable Care Act.
This time, the Trump administration
is trying to pull funding from health
facilities that tell the truth to their
patients—facilities like Planned Par-
enthood—that nearly 100,000 Ohioans
rely on. They are blocking title X fund-
ing for any healthcare organization
that actually gives patients medically
relevant information and the full range
of healthcare options. We know who
makes these decisions. I hate to say it
this way, but it is mostly White men in
Washington, and they have very seri-
ous consequences for Ohio women.
This month, two Planned Parenthood
clinics in Cincinnati announced they
will have to close their doors. This will
be devastating for so many Southwest
Ohio women. It will mean they have
fewer options for healthcare services
they need, including preventive care
like cancer screenings and STI testing
and birth control. It will mean many
women won’t be able to see the doctors
they rely on and trust.
A student in Cincinnati named Caro-
line—who said we can use her first
name—talked to a local reporter about
what this decision means for her. She
said:
I have a very close relationship with my
provider. There’s a lot of trust there that’s
been built over the years.
But now, because of this President,
she is not going to be able to see that
doctor anymore—to what purpose
other than playing politics?
I got a letter from another woman in
Cincinnati, who wrote:
As someone who lost her grandmother to
uterine cancer in March, I know how impor-
tant it is for women to have access to the
healthcare services that Planned Parenthood
provides. Women have the right to make in-
formed decisions about their own bodies and
to have access to examinations that can help
save their lives.
That came from a woman in Cin-
cinnati.
We know Planned Parenthood pro-
vides these exams and tests. These
clinics are often the only places that
many women and some men have to
turn. They either can’t afford some-
where else, or they live too far away
from other healthcare providers to
have any other real option. Last year,
the West Side clinic that is closing in
Cincinnati performed more than 6,900
STI tests. The Springdale clinic that is
closing performed more than 6,300
tests.
Another woman from Cincinnati
wrote to say that her 30-year-old
daughter has an advanced degree, but
her income is ‘‘below poverty level,’’
and she relies on Planned Parenthood
for her care. Does this mean she won’t
get care? It probably does. It means she
can’t afford to go anywhere else. She
will just go without care, and we know
what can then happen to someone. The
mother of the 30-year-old daughter
said: ‘‘Now she will be hard-pressed to
find a provider that will take her for
checkups, to receive birth control and
more.’’
The assault on women’s healthcare
isn’t just coming from the Trump ad-
ministration; they are encouraging
rightwing State legislatures all over
the country. Over the past few years,
we have seen State legislatures nota-
bly—including my State, unfortu-
nately, Ohio—making it harder and
harder for clinics to operate and pro-
vide those preventive services. They

cut funding, they increase redtape,
they rail against bureaucrats and bu-
reaucracy, but they make it harder
with more redtape. They come up with
rule after unnecessary rule to dissuade
young women from coming to these
clinics.
These rules aren’t really about pa-
tient health; they are about closing
health clinics. Again, who made these
laws? It is always the same. It is men
who don’t listen, men who don’t under-
stand how women’s bodies’ work. It is
men who don’t understand how preven-
tive care, like birth control, works. It
is time for old White men in Wash-
ington and in courtrooms to stop try-
ing to take away women’s healthcare.

TRIBUTE TO JAMES MIDDLETON
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, Dr.
James Middleton has spent nearly
every day of his adult life caring for
others. As a family physician in Hart
County, KY, he has dedicated himself
to promoting the health and well-being
of his community. When he inherited
the family farm and its 150-year-old
history, James also made a pledge to
conserve that land for all those who
might enjoy it.
Recently, my friend was recognized
for the exceptional care he has pro-
vided to his community with the Ken-
tucky Leopold Conservation Award. I
would like to take a moment to con-
gratulate him on this prestigious rec-
ognition and to thank him for his years
of conservation to protect our environ-
ment and benefit Kentucky commu-
nities.
Our Commonwealth is blessed with a
rich ecosystem and picturesque land-
scapes. James’ home, including the
years-old tobacco farm, is near two of
our most remarkable natural treas-
ures: the Mammoth Cave system and
the Green River. In an effort to help
protect these magnificent features,
James chose to participate in the To-
bacco Buyout, which was created by
legislation I introduced to free Ken-
tucky farmers from a Depression-era
tobacco quota system. He set out on a
new agricultural path and focused on
crops that would protect his region and
one of the most bio-diverse rivers in
the world.
James designed a new style of land
management specifically to benefit the
natural environment of his community
and our country. He began growing
hay, raising pasture-fed cattle, and
harvesting hardwoods. By his esti-
mation, he has planted more than a
million trees, and the majority of his
farm is now forestland. As a result, his
600 acres of vegetation have formed a
natural barrier to protect the Green
River from runoff and other threats.
I would like to congratulate my
friend for his remarkable leadership in
Hart County and his important con-
servation work that has benefited Ken-
tucky and our environment. He is cer-
tainly deserving of this distinguished
award, and I ask my Senate colleagues
to join me in honoring Dr. James Mid-
dleton for his passionate protection of
our heritage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5491
September 16, 2019
On September 12, Patsy earned well-
deserved honors from the National As-
sociation of Broadcasters for her long-
time leadership as president and owner
of California Oregon Broadcasting,
Inc., COBi.
As association president and our
former Senate colleague Gordon Smith
put it in presenting Patsy with its
Chuck Sherman Television Leadership
Award for local TV in medium and
smaller markets, ‘‘Patsy’s passion for
excellence in small market local tele-
vision is unmatched. She exemplifies
the best of broadcasting by running the
longest continuously-owned and oper-
ated, independent broadcast organiza-
tion in the West.’’
Like former Senator Smith and
countless elected officials throughout
our State, I have come to know Patsy
from regular visits to southern Oregon
for townhalls, community meetings,
and more.
When I visit TV station KOBI in Med-
ford, I can always count on a wide-
ranging and thought-provoking set of
questions from her station’s journal-
ists, and of course, that steadfast com-
mitment to serious and fair journalism
starts at the top with Patsy.
As the son of a journalist, I very
much appreciate her unshakable dedi-
cation to independent journalism that
continues in the very best tradition of
both her profession and in the legacy
established back in 1933 by California
Oregon Broadcasting, Inc.
As a Senator, I appreciate in equal
measure her rock-solid devotion to
local journalism that serves viewers so
well in all of southern Oregon.
In Patsy’s remarks accepting her
award, she noted that ‘‘Television in
medium and smaller markets is a busi-
ness where the hours are often long,
the pressure to get it right is heavy,
and the monetary compensation is not
equal to the responsibilities.’’
Then with classic Patsy modesty, she
added, ‘‘I have been very fortunate
throughout my career to be surrounded
by individuals who might not make a
lot of money, but who make a positive
difference in their community each and
every day and love their work.’’
I will conclude my remarks by saying
all of southern Oregon is incredibly for-
tunate that Patsy has set the bar high
both for working long hours and love of
her profession to make a positive dif-
ference in her community each and
every day.

Peter B. Edelman, faculty director of
the Center on Poverty and Inequality
at Georgetown University, has done
and for his decades-long career fighting
for working families. Along with his
equally if not more impressive wife,
Marian Wright Edelman, it is not an
exaggeration to say the two have im-
proved the lives of millions of Ameri-
cans.
A key figure in planning Senator
Robert F. Kennedy’s memorable tour of
the Mississippi Delta, Professor
Edelman continues to help expose the
crippling poverty that still permeates
through our country. His books ‘‘So
Rich, So Poor: Why It’s so Hard to End
Poverty in America’’ and ‘‘Not a Crime
to Be Poor. The Criminalization of
Poverty in America’’ have been impor-
tant in shaping my view on the lack of
economic mobility in America. A dedi-
cated public servant who has worked in
various administrations and organiza-
tions, Professor Edelman has been on
the forefront of promoting and imple-
menting social justice policies.
While I recognize we live in a time
where politicians and special interests
groups have tipped the scales in favor
of corporations and the wealthy, I am
encouraged to know that Professor
Edelman is educating the next genera-
tion of anti-poverty advocates.
As the Coalition on Human Needs
honors Professor Edelman as a recipi-
ent of its 2019 Human Needs Hero
award, I want to express my thanks for
his work as an advocate of working
families. He has improved countless
lives, and his pragmatic yet principled
approach serves as a model for those
pursuing social change now and for
years to come. For these reasons, it is
my honor and privilege today to recog-
nize the achievements of Professor
Peter B. Edelman.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF JOURNEY
HOUSE
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today
I wish to recognize Journey House in
Milwaukee, WI, on its 50th anniver-
sary. For five decades, Journey House
has been a beacon of hope in the city’s
Clarke Square neighborhood. Since its
founding in the summer of 1969, Jour-
ney House has made tremendous
strides in helping families move out of
poverty on Milwaukee’s near South-
side. I am delighted to honor this re-
markable community organization and
commemorate this significant mile-
stone.
Through its four core programs,
Journey House has helped low-income
community members achieve their
greatest potential. Its adult education
program provides basic skills and GED
education in both English and Spanish
to lay the foundation for a successful
career path. Its youth development
programs focus on keeping children
and young adults away from drugs and
violence. Its emphasis on workforce
readiness builds the skills and motiva-
tion employers seek. Its family engage-
ment events offer the simple but im-
portant gift of spending time together
in a safe and welcoming environment.
Programming also includes community
learning centers, housing for homeless
youth aging out of foster care, and af-
fordable family housing.
Journey House began with a staff of
two local teenagers, Zlan Kleczewski
and Rudy Rosas, working as codirec-
tors. With funding from VISTA—Vol-
unteers in Service to America—they
organized programs for youth engage-
ment and development. As Journey
House started to grow and as Zlan and
Rudy returned to school, the organiza-
tion sought permanent leadership.
After receiving its first VISTA grant
in 1969, Journey House hired its first
full-time director in 1971. Today, Jour-
ney House is led by Dr. Michele Bria
who, since her start in 1998, has been
the inspiration behind the agency’s
success. Under her leadership, the
agency has grown from a small oper-
ation with two sites and a $200,000
budget to a multimillion dollar organi-
zation that serves thousands daily. Her
hard work and commitment are re-
flected in the achievements of count-
less youth and families who have bro-
ken the cycle of poverty.
From its humble beginnings five dec-
ades ago, Journey House has played a
transformative role in one of Milwau-
kee’s most ethnically diverse and eco-
nomically challenged neighborhoods. I
am proud to recognize the contribu-
tions made by Journey House over the
past 50 years, and I am grateful for the
work the staff do every day to change
lives for the better.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
RECOGNIZING HIGH STREET
CHURCH
∑ Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I rise
today in recognition of High Street
Church of Christ in Tuscumbia, AL.
For over a century, this church has
been a source of hope and inspiration
to the city of Tuscumbia and the State
of Alabama. Through their ministry
and outreach, they have transformed
the lives of so many Alabamians.
Last year, on September 28–30, High
Street Church of Christ hosted their
centennial celebration with 2 days of
events commemorating 100 years of
tireless work and dedication. The
speakers for the event included Broth-
ers Michael S. Robert, Mansel Long,
and Stanley Hubbard, many of whom
who have been longstanding members
of the church. I am proud to be able to
honor the High Street Church here on
the U.S. Senate floor and to let the
congregants of this church know that
they have my support and good wishes.
In is written, ‘‘Upon this rock I will
build my church.’’ High Street Church
of Christ has proven to be a rock—a
pillar of the local community in North-
west Alabama—since its inception in
1918. High Street Church has been a
trailblazer as one of the first minority
congregations in north Alabama. Under
the current leadership of Brothers
Eddie Goodloe, William Long, Roderick
Metcalf, and Thomas Sledge, the
church’s good work continues.
As they approach their 101st celebra-
tion, I congratulate the church on its
first 100 years, and I look forward its
continued growth and watching its

To the Congress of the United States:

ment in the coming weeks.
Accordingly, pursuant to section
103(a)(2) of the Bipartisan Congres-

Congress that I intend to enter into a
trade agreement regarding tariff bar-
riers with Japan under section 103(a) of
the Act.
In addition, I also will be entering
into an Executive Agreement with
Japan regarding digital trade.
My Administration looks forward to
continued collaboration with the Con-
gress on further negotiations with
Japan to achieve a comprehensive
trade agreement that results in more
fair and reciprocal trade between the
United States and Japan.

rent resolution; which was considered
and agreed to:
S. CON. RES. 25
Whereas, on September 11, 2001, the United
States endured a violent terrorist attack
leading to the tragic deaths and injuries of
thousands of innocent United States citizens
and other citizens from more than 90 dif-
ferent nations and territories;
Whereas, in response to the attacks in New
York City, Washington, DC, and Shanksville,
Pennsylvania, firefighters, uniformed offi-
cers, emergency medical technicians, physi-
cians, nurses, military personnel, and other
first responders immediately rose to service
in the heroic attempt to save the lives of the
people in danger;
Whereas, in the immediate aftermath of
the attacks, thousands of recovery workers,
including trades personnel, iron workers,
equipment operators, and many others,
joined with uniformed officers and military
personnel to help search for and recover vic-
tims lost in the attacks;
Whereas, in the days, weeks, and months
following the attacks, thousands of people in
the United States and others spontaneously
volunteered to help support the rescue and
recovery efforts, braving both physical and
emotional hardship;
Whereas many first responders, rescue and
recovery workers, volunteers, and survivors
of the attacks continue to suffer from seri-
ous medical illnesses and emotional distress
related to the physical and mental trauma of
the tragedy;
Whereas hundreds of thousands of brave
men and women continue to serve every day,
having answered the call to duty as members
of the Armed Forces, with some having given
their lives or suffered injury to defend the
security of the United States and prevent
further terrorist attacks;
Whereas all people of the United States
witnessed and endured the tragedy of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and, in the immediate after-
math of the attacks, became unified under a
remarkable spirit of service and compassion
that inspired the people of the United States;
Whereas, in the years immediately fol-
lowing the attacks of September 11, 2001, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics documented a
marked increase in volunteerism among the
people of the United States;
Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed and
President Barack Obama signed the bipar-
tisan Serve America Act (Public Law 111–13;
123 Stat. 1460), which established, at the re-
quest of the 9/11 community, Federal rec-
ognition of September 11 as a ‘‘National Day
of Service and Remembrance’’ and charged
the Corporation for National and Commu-
nity Service with leading this annual day of
service; and
Whereas, since Congress and the President
provided for Federal recognition of Sep-
tember 11 as a ‘‘National Day of Service and
Remembrance’’ (commonly referred to as ‘‘9/
11 Day’’), millions of people in the United
States observe the anniversary by engaging
in a wide range of service activities and pri-
vate forms of prayer and remembrance: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress—
(1) recognizes, commends, and honors the
selfless dedication to fellow citizens dis-
played through the heroic actions of first re-
sponders and other citizens in New York,
Washington, DC, and Shanksville, Pennsyl-
vania;
(2) calls upon the Members of the Senate
and the House of Representatives and all
people of the United States to observe Sep-
tember 11, 2019, as a ‘‘National Day of Serv-
ice and Remembrance’’, with appropriate and
personal expressions of service and reflec-
tion, which can include performing good
deeds, displaying the United States flag, at-
tending memorial and remembrance serv-
ices, and engaging in community service or
other charitable activities—
(A) in honor of the people who lost their
lives or were injured in the attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001; and
(B) in tribute to the people who rose to
service—
(i) to come to the aid of the people in need;
and
(ii) in defense of the United States; and
(3) urges all people of the United States to
continue to live their lives throughout the
year with the same spirit of unity, service,
and compassion that was exhibited through-
out the United States following the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001.

f
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
am here today on the Senate floor for
‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ speech No. 253.
If you felt like the heat this summer
was particularly brutal, you were not
imagining things. July was the hottest
month ever recorded, according to
NOAA. The Secretary General of the
World Meteorological Organization
noted, ‘‘July has rewritten climate his-
tory, with dozens of new temperature
records at [the] local, national and
global level.’’
NOAA says 2019 is on track to tie for
the second hottest year on record.
Overall, the past 5 years are expected
to take the title of the hottest 5-year
period in recorded human history.
This rapid heating of our Earth is
wreaking havoc on our environment
and public health. Here is a list from
NOAA that you can find on their
website, Selected Significant Climate
Anomalies and Events, July 2019, all
around the globe.
In 1 day—1 day—the Greenland ice
sheet lost 121⁄2 billion tons of ice, melt-
ed into the sea. Throughout the world,
from France to India, to the Arctic Cir-
cle, temperature records shattered. On
July 4, the people of Anchorage, AK,
experienced their first ever 90-degree
day. At one point in July, excessive
heat warnings asked nearly 170 million
Americans to avoid the outdoors and
take shelter in air conditioning, where
available.
According to Deke Arndt, head of cli-
mate monitoring for NOAA, these
record heat waves are, and I quote him,
‘‘almost entirely due to climate
change.’’ Jack Williams, a professor
with the Center for Climatic Research
at the University of Wisconsin, told
NBC news the ‘‘[h]eat waves of today
are going to be the normal events of to-
morrow.’’
Where there is heat, there is apt to
be fire. In the United States, wildfires
rage on a remarkable scale. According
to a new report by the major data ana-
lytics company CoreLogic, over 8.7 mil-
lion acres burned in the United States
in 2018. That is about the land area of
the 75 largest cities in the United
States combined.
This summer, the Arctic experienced
a record-setting wildfire season. Places
that have not traditionally burned in
parts of northern Canada, Alaska,
Greenland, and Siberia were engulfed
in flames visible from space.
In this map, the North Pole is about
here. This looks down at Alaska here
and Russia here, the Siberian Arctic.
As you can see, fires were everywhere.
Guillermo Rein of Imperial College
London told Wired:
Arctic fires are rare, but they’re not un-
precedented. What is unprecedented is the
number of fires that are happening. Never
before have satellites around the planet seen
this level of activity.
As of August 28, fires cut across more
than 6 million acres of Siberian forest
and 2.5 million acres of Alaskan tundra
and forested land.
These forests aren’t just scarring the
Arctic landscape; they are also releas-
ing tons more of carbon dioxide, caus-
ing more climate change. Researchers
estimate the Arctic fires have released
more than 180 million tons of CO2. For
comparison, my home State of Rhode
Island was responsible for around 9.75
million tons of carbon dioxide through
our fossil fuel combustion in 2016—
roughly 20 times as much, just from
these fires.
NASA scientists are also tracing soot
from these fires. The soot absorbs sun-
light and warms the atmosphere; and
when the soot settles and covers Arctic
ice, it absorbs more sunlight and
speeds up the melting and the warm-
ing. Once these forces are set in mo-
tion, the vicious cycle of warmer tem-
peratures, wildfires, ice melt, and then
ever warmer temperature is hard to
break.
Far from the Arctic, fires rage in an-
other iconic ecosystem: the Amazon.
So far this year, the Amazon region
has seen over 40,000 fires. Unlike the
Arctic, our changing climate is less to
blame for the devastation than hu-
mans.
Again, natural forest fires in the
Amazon are rare, but warmer and dryer
conditions under climate change do
make the fires larger and longer last-
ing than in the past. The true culprit
in Brazil is manmade deforestation, ac-
celerating under the new Brazilian
President. Enforcement against illegal
logging and clearing has declined. In
the first 6 months of this year, over
1,300 square miles of Amazon forest
were destroyed in Brazil, sometimes at
a rate of more than three football
fields’ worth of forest per minute.
The journal Science Advances warns
that deforestation in the Amazon is
close to a threshold beyond which the
rainforest will undergo irreversible
changes. Without the healthy forests of
the Amazon, the world will lose one of
its most important terrestrial carbon
sinks—areas that naturally absorb car-
bon from our atmosphere. The Amazon
captures about 5 percent of annual
global carbon dioxide emissions. A 2015
study published in Nature shows that
the amount of carbon dioxide the Ama-
zon absorbs is already falling, has fall-
en since the 1990s by nearly one-third.
In Brazil, the air has gotten so thick
with smoke that in Porto Velho, a city
in the upper Amazon basin, over 400
children landed in a local hospital with
respiratory problems in the first 3
weeks of August. Public health offi-
cials and resources are overwhelmed. A
pediatrician in Porto Velho said:
‘‘Every year we have some fires and
issues with smoke, but this was the
worst year of them all.’’
The tragedy in Brazil is reminiscent
of forests burned in Southeast Asia to
make way for palm oil plantations. Su-
matra, Borneo, and parts of Malaysia
saw over 70 percent of their peat forest
lost to manmade deforestation. In In-
donesia, nearly 106,000 acres burned in
just the first 5 months of this year.
I am from the Ocean State. Wildfires,
of course, don’t burn in the ocean, but
unprecedented heat waves are surging
through our seas, laying waste to coral
reefs in much the way wildfires ravage
forests. The harm to the Amazon
rainforests and to the Arctic steppes
from wildfire finds an aquatic echo in
the death of the Great Barrier Reef and
reefs all over the world from climate-
driven, unprecedented ocean heat
waves.
Our willful blindness to these obvious
calamities playing out on God’s Earth,
which are largely due to malign influ-
ence from the fossil fuel industry and
its great armada of front groups it uses
to do its dirty business, needs to stop.
The willful blindness has to come to an
end. From the Equator to the Arctic,
an Earth aflame will have life-or-death
consequences for generations to come.
Even our news media are turning
their collective backs. In late August,
as these fires raged, Media Matters
chronicled that not one—not one—of
the five influential Sunday news shows
covered them. They are basically polit-
ical gossip shows. Indeed, Media Mat-
ters showed cable news devoted to
wildfires in the Amazon only 7 percent
of the time they devoted to the Notre
Dame Cathedral fire. In other speeches,
I pointed out how the royal baby has
swamped climate coverage in our pa-
thetic media.
Whether in Indonesia or Brazilian
rain forests or Arctic tundra, the costs
of the corporate greed and paid-for po-
litical ignorance that are stopping us

from acting are on full display. Our
planet suffers as a consequence. We
avert our eyes in the pursuit of cheap
fossil fuel. But nothing comes without
a cost, and our debt is coming due.
Pope Francis drove home this point in
a recent Sunday address, saying: ‘‘We
have caused a climate emergency that
gravely threatens nature and life itself,
including our own.’’
Our world is on fire. I am sorry to
quarrel with Billy Joel, but this time,
we did start the fire. If that can’t get
the attention of my colleagues in Con-
gress, I do not know what can.
We must wake up.

NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE
MONTH
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, September 16, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and sincere admiration that I rise
to celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month
and its 2019 theme, Hispanic Americans: A
History of Serving Our Nation. From Sep-
tember 15, 2019, through October 15, 2019, in
honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, the people
of the United States will once again celebrate
the cultures and traditions and reflect on the
many exceptional contributions our Hispanic
brothers and sisters have made throughout
our country’s history.
Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins each
year on September 15, recognizes the anni-
versaries of the independence of five Latin
American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Mexico
and Chile observe their independence days on
September 16 and September 18, respec-
tively. Since its inception as National Hispanic
Heritage Week in 1968, which later became
National Hispanic Heritage Month in 1988,
Americans have taken this time to not only
honor the rich culture and traditions of His-
panic Americans, but also to reflect on the
steadfast impact Hispanic Americans have
had within their communities and throughout
our nation. The diligent efforts of generations
of Hispanic Americans have resulted in a bet-
ter America.
America’s success is reliant upon the rich
heritage and cultural diversity of its people.
Hispanic Heritage Month celebrates the many
Hispanic leaders and members of our commu-
nities who have added to the prosperity of the
United States in every facet of our society.
Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask you and
my other distinguished colleagues to once
again join me in recognizing Hispanic Heritage
Month. Throughout America’s history, present,
and future, the Hispanic community has
played and will continue to play a vital role in
enriching the quality of life for the people of
the United States and, for their remarkable
contributions, they are worthy of our deepest
respect and gratitude.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHIEF WAR-
RANT OFFICER 5 FREDERICK J.
CAZZOLA’S INDUCTION INTO THE
U.S. ARMY ORDNANCE CORPS
HALL OF FAME
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, September 16, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to recognize the dedicated years of serv-
ice and incredible achievements of Kaukauna
resident, Chief Warrant Officer 5 Frederick J.
Cazzola.
Mr. Cazzola joined the United States Army
Reserve in May 1970. He attended Basic
Training at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and pro-
gressed to Advanced Individual Training as an
Ammunition Specialist assigned to the 395th
Ordnance Company at Redstone Arsenal, Ala-
bama.
After 13 years of service, then Staff Ser-
geant Cazzola was promoted to Warrant Offi-
cer 1 and assigned to the 2nd Ammunition
Platoon. Warrant Officer Cazzola’s outstanding
performance and execution of his duties
earned him placement in the Active Guard Re-
serve Program in 1992.
Chief Warrant Officer Cazzola continued to
excel through the ranks during his service,
eventually earning the rank of Chief Warrant
Officer 5. From 1995 to 2002, CW5 Cazzola
served as a Support Maintenance Technician
and the Ammunition Technician at a Regional
Training Site. His commitment to serve was
clear as he took on additional responsibilities
in his role as Accountability Officer and Facility
Manager.
CW5 Cazzola retired from the United States
Army in February 2007 after a career of distin-
guished service. CW5 Cazzola was proudly in-
ducted into the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps
Hall of Fame as part of the 2019 Class of
Contemporary Inductees. Induction into the
U.S. Army Ordnance Corps Hall of Fame is a
true honor and is reserved only for service
members who go above and beyond their call
of duty. It recognizes significant contributions
made to the Ordnance Mission of the Army.
CW5 Cazzola’s numerous years of selfless
service to this country are truly inspiring.
Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to
join me in thanking CW5 Cazzola for his serv-
ice and congratulating him on his induction
into the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps Hall of
Fame.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE ORANGE
COUNTY HISTORICAL SOCIETY
CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, September 16, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in celebration of the Orange County Historical
Society’s 100th year of historical preservation.
The County of Orange in Southern Cali-
fornia was officially formed on August 1, 1889.
Thirty years later, on May 28, 1919, the Or-
ange County Historical Society was founded to
collect and preserve all materials relating to
the history of Orange County.
The founding directors were prominent civic
leaders: Samuel Armor, one of the County’s
first supervisors; H. Clay Kellogg, a civil engi-
neer; Charles C. Chapman, citrus pioneer and
philanthropist; and Samuel M. Davis, lawyer
and former O.C. District Attorney.
The Society assisted with the interpretation
of archaeological sites, planned rancho-style
fiestas, organized parades and all manner of
activities that involved or reflected local his-
tory. They even successfully petitioned the
federal government to rename Sugarloaf Peak
in the Santa Ana Mountains as Pleasants
Peak, in honor of pioneer and Society member
‘‘Judge’’ J.E. Pleasants.
The Society has encapsulated Orange
County’s history through many landmark
books and distinguished publications, including
the Orange County History Series, the Cen-
tennial Bibliography of Orange County (1989),
and the Orange Countiana, a journal that fea-
tures articles written by many of Orange
County’s finest historians.
The Society has collaborated with local uni-
versities, such as California State University of
Fullerton and Chapman University, to host his-
torical conferences, workshops, tours of his-
toric sites, and banquets honoring local pio-
neers. One especially popular event is the OC
History Round-Up, a gathering where history
comes alive through storytelling, music, and
reenactments of some of Orange County’s
iconic historical figures.
The Society has hosted hundreds of diverse
speakers who have played significant roles in
Orange County’s history. Additionally, the
group recognizes outstanding work by histo-
rians with its Terry E. Stephenson Award and,
for student historians, the Friis Pioneer Press
Award.
The Orange County Historical Society will
mark its Centennial with a celebratory gala on
September 14, 2019. Please join me in con-
gratulating the Society and its members for
reaching this important milestone and for their
tireless work bringing together families, resi-
dents, and historians to discover and explore
Orange County’s rich history.

With the creation of the Office of the Chief Ad-
ministrative Officer (CAO) in 1996 the Fur-
nishings Department was moved from the Of-
fice of the Clerk to the CAO. Lou held various
positions within the Furnishings Department,
including Laborer, Inventory Control Clerk and
Logistics Distribution Specialist.
In 2009, Lou began working for the Ac-
countable Equipment & Assets as an Acquisi-
tion Counselor. He remained in this position
until his retirement. Lou’s official title upon his
retirement is a Purchasing Agent for Acquisi-
tions Management which falls under the Office
of the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO). As
a Purchasing Agent for the Office of Acquisi-
tions Management, Lou was responsible for
the process required to efficiently purchase
quality equipment, furniture, office supplies
and related items for the House community at-
large. In retirement, Lou has plans to do some
more travelling. In addition, he hopes to do
some volunteer work with his church. Lou also
plans to relax and cheer for his beloved Dallas
Cowboys on their road to future Super Bowl
victories.
On behalf of the entire House community,
we extend congratulations to Lou in grateful
recognition of and appreciation for his many
years of dedicated service and outstanding
contributions to the U.S. House of Represent-

HONORING THE BOYS AND GIRLS
CLUB OF GREATER SANTA ROSA
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, September 16, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Boys and
Girls Club of Greater Santa Rosa on the occa-
sion of its 70th Anniversary.
The Boys and Girls Club of Greater Santa
Rosa opened its doors in 1949 with the gen-
erous support of local leaders who donated
their time and resources to establish a safe
place for children to go during the after-school
hours. Since then, the club has provided boys
and girls with a place to learn, play, develop
academic skills, and engage in physical activ-
ity. They satisfy the age-old desire of young
people to have a ‘‘club’’ of their own. Staffed
by full-time and part-time Youth Development
Professionals, and supplemented by pas-
sionate and caring volunteers, the club is open
more than 250 days per year.
One major tenet of the Boys & Girls Club of
Greater Santa Rosa is diversity. They strive to
reflect the makeup of our community and
serve boys and girls of all races, religions, and
cultures. The programs and activities are con-
ducted in the warm, friendly atmosphere of fa-
cilities specifically designed for youth. The
Club is open to all members at any time dur-
ing hours of operation and offers varied and
diversified programs that recognize and re-
spond to the collective and individual needs of
girls and boys. The Club is guidance-oriented
and emphasizes values inherent in the rela-
tionships between young people, their peers,
and adults.
Madam Speaker, for seventy years, the
Boys and Girls Club of Greater Santa Rosa
has provided a safe, fun place for children to
learn and play. It is therefore fitting and proper
that we honor its 70th anniversary here today.

TRIBUTE TO DR. ALFONSO
‘‘CHICO’’ CHISCANO
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, September 16, 2019
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today I rise in honor of Dr. Alfonso ‘‘Chico’’
Chiscano who passed away Tuesday, August
27, 2019. A pillar of the San Antonio commu-
nity, Dr. Chiscano dedicated his life to helping
others and preserving our community’s history.
He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Mary-
Alice; his daughters, Kristie and Carina; sons,
Steve and Todd; and eight grandchildren.
Dr. Alfonso ‘‘Chico’’ Chiscano was born on
July 22, 1938 in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, part
of Spain’s Canary Islands. At an early age he
demonstrated a keen interest in medicine and
community involvement. He attended medical
school in Barcelona, Spain where he earned
high marks, later completing his General Sur-
gery Residency at Wayne State University in
Detroit, Michigan. He soon rose to prominence
and became one of San Antonio’s top
cardiothoracic surgeons. During his medical
career, he performed countless surgical oper-
ations and assisted in saving more than 6,000
lives. He was also the first to perform open-
heart surgery on the Canary Islands.
Dr. Chiscano is well-known in San Antonio
as a person who committed his life to civic en-
gagement. He worked tirelessly as a Cultural
Ambassador for San Antonio, connecting his
native Canary Islands through business and
cultural ties. He also worked on numerous his-
torical preservation initiatives. Dr. Chiscano
was named ‘‘The Father of the Tricentennial,’’
celebrating the city’s 300-year history.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have known
such a remarkable individual who defined
what it means to live in the service of others.
Throughout his life, he inspired all who en-
countered him. The entire San Antonio com-
munity mourns this tremendous loss. I know
his legacy and memory will live on in every
single life he changed.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIRE-
MENT OF PATTY KLEINKNECHT
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, September 16, 2019
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, today I rise
to honor the fourteen years of service Patty
Kleinknecht has provided to the residents and
businesses of Sacramento’s River District.
Patty Kleinknecht has not only been an inte-
gral piece of the River District’s development,
but an impactful force throughout Sacramento.
Today, I ask my colleagues to stand with me
in celebration of her retirement and her excep-
tional legacy as an advocate for the River Dis-
trict’s revitalization.
Patty graduated with a bachelor’s degree
from Texas Tech University. Prior to joining
the River District, Patty gained valuable expe-
rience in commercial real estate management
and retail management serving as general
manager for the Central Dallas Association for
12 years, and Property Manager for Colliers
Texas Management and Pegasus Real Estate
Management, Inc. She has over 25 years of
public district management experience in the
exciting cities of Sacramento and Dallas,
Texas.
The River District, situated at the confluence
of the American and Sacramento rivers, is
centrally located in Sacramento and houses
important business and organizations to the
region such as Loaves and Fishes, the Power-
house Science Center, and the residential de-
velopment Township Nine. Through her tire-
less leadership, Patty has led the development
and expansion of the River District, creating
the ground work for it’s exciting future expan-
sion. One of her greatest legacies will be her
work in advancing the Powerhouse Science
Center, formerly a PG&E plant along the Sac-
ramento River. She helped it become a future
sight of education and exploration for
Sacramentans and visitors alike. Patty’s lead-
ership ensured the River District became an
anchor in our community and a testament to
Sacramento’s potential. Her work will always
be remembered as the District continues to
blossom over the coming years.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Patty
Kleinknecht’s successful career and her role
as a visionary for the River District. Patty is a
true Sacramento treasure and a leader in our
community. I ask all my colleagues to join me
in wishing her the best in her retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF AMERICAN
LEGION POST 117 ELEFSON-
ZEUSKE’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, September 16, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor American Legion Post 117
Elefson-Zeuske as its members celebrate the
100th anniversary of their charter in Shawano,
Wisconsin.
Post 117 was chartered on November 1,
1919 in the name of Edwin Elefson as a patri-
otic veterans organization dedicated to sup-
porting America’s service members and vet-
erans. A member of the 32nd Red Arrow Divi-
sion, Elefson was killed in action on Sep-
tember 14, 1918 in France. He is memorial-
ized at the Oise-Aisne American Cemetery.
The Post held its first meeting on November
17, 1919 shortly after 30 members signed the
original charter. In 1942, the Post changed its
name to Elefson-Zeuske in honor of Wilmer
Zeuske. A Sergeant in the US Army, Wilmer
Zeuske was killed in action during World War
II.
For 100 years, the Post has been an active
member of the greater Shawano community
by sponsoring numerous activities with the
goal of improving the community, state, and
nation. The members work hard to improve
youth leadership through school programs,
Boy Scout programs, and American Legion
baseball.
The Post has helped develop statewide vet-
eran programs to ensure that veterans are
cared for when they return home from service.
The members of Elefson-Zeuske truly embody

INTRODUCTION OF THE
TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION
ACCOUNTABILITY AND PREVEN-
TION ACT OF 2019 (TRAP ACT)
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, September 16, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, as Chair-
man of the U.S. Helsinki Commission—a con-
gressional watchdog for human rights and de-
mocracy in Europe and Eurasia—I am fre-
quently reminded of the new opportunities that
technology and globalization present for
human rights defenders around the globe. For
those struggling to defend their liberty and
human dignity, our interconnected world brings
with it the possibility of sharing information,
coordinating action, and demonstrating soli-
darity across thousands of miles in fractions of
a second. It means that truth is more capable
of piercing the veil of enforced ignorance
erected by the world’s most repressive states
Technology also further empowers dissidents
in exile to connect with, and influence the foot
soldiers of freedom who march on in their
homelands.
But with these new openings for liberty
come novel approaches to repression. Authori-
tarian and autocratic regimes are appropriating
agile, 21st century technology to prop up scle-
rotic systems of brutality and corruption. Tech-
nological developments have provoked greater
feelings of insecurity in these brittle regimes
and propelled them to extend their repression
far beyond their borders, sometimes reaching
into the refuge of democratic societies where
political opponents, independent journalists,
and civil society activists operate in safety.
Madam Speaker, I recently introduced bipar-
tisan legislation to tackle these emerging chal-
lenges with my friend and Helsinki Commis-
sion Ranking Member, Representative JOE
WILSON of South Carolina We are confident
that this legislation, supported by the bi-
cameral leadership of the Helsinki Commis-
sion and other leaders on human rights, will
place the United States on course to lead the
free world in holding the line against these
modern manifestations of political persecution,
or what some have called ‘‘transnational re-
pression.’’ The Transnational Repression Ac-
countability and Prevention Act—or TRAP
Act—is designed to counter one key instru-
ment in the autocrat’s 21st century toolkit po-
litically-motivated abuse of the International
Criminal Police Organization, more commonly
known as INTERPOL.
INTERPOL is a legitimate and potent tool
for international law enforcement coopera-
tion—one that the United States relies on
heavily to bring criminals to justice and thwart
threats to security around the globe. Sadly,
autocrats have recognized the potential for re-
pression in INTERPOL’s worldwide commu-
nications system that ties into the law enforce-
ment agencies of its 194 member countries.
The Helsinki Commission regularly receives
credible reports from human rights defenders,
journalists, political activists, and
businesspeople who have fallen victim to the
efforts of corrupt regimes to ensnare them
using INTERPOL’s system of international re-
quests for arrest and extradition, known as
Red Notices and Diffusions. These are the
modern-day ‘‘traps’’ addressed by the TRAP
Act. Because of these notices, innocent indi-
viduals live in fear of traveling mternationally
and have been detained, had their bank ac-
counts closed, and, sometimes, been returned
into the hands of the very regimes from which
they escaped.
Madam Speaker, our legislation opens three
new fronts agamst the threat of INTERPOL
abuse. First, it clearly states that it is the pol-
icy of the United States to use our influence
in INTERPOL to advance specific reforms that
increase transparency and accountability for
those that abuse the system while helping the
organization to live up to its stated obligations
to uphold international human rights standards
and resist politicization It further establishes
that the United States will use its diplomatic
clout to confront countries that abuse
INTERPOL and work to ensure the freedom of
movement and ability to engage in lawful com-
merce of victims of this abuse the world over.
Second, the TRAP Act exerts oversight over
the United States’ internal mechanisms to
identify, challenge, and respond to instances
of INTERPOL abuse. The bill requires the De-
partments of Justice, Homeland Security, and
State—in coordination with other relevant
agencies—to submit to Congress an assess-
ment of the scope and seriousness of auto-
cratic abuse of INTERPOL, an evaluation of
the adequacy of the processes in place do-
mestically and at INTERPOL to resist this
abuse, and a plan for improving interagency
coordination to confront this phenomenon.
Third, and perhaps most importantly, the
TRAP Act places strict limitations on how the
United States Government can use
INTERPOL notices in legal or administrative
proceedings that could interfere with the free-
dom or immigration status of individuals in our
country. We have been deeply concerned by
reports that some authorities in this country
have improperly cited INTERPOL notices from
autocratic countries to detain individuals and
place them in danger of being returned to the
very countries from which they fled. The TRAP
Act will make crystal clear that autocratic re-
gimes cannot use INTERPOL notices to
weaponize the U.S. judicial system against
their political targets.
Madam Speaker, these measures are crit-
ical to restricting the freedom that some auto-
cratic regimes have enjoyed to harass, per-
secute, and detain their political opponents
around the world. Authoritarian and autocratic
states like China, Russia, Kazakhstan,
Tajikistan, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Venezuela
must be called out by name and held to ac-
count for their repeated manipulation of legiti-
mate law enforcement tools for petty political
ends.
Madam Speaker, I would also like to place
the TRAP Act in the context of the other work
that the U.S. Helsinki Commission has done to
address the grave threat of transnational re-
pression and malign influence by authoritarian
regimes. The Countering Russian and Other
Overseas Kleptocracy—or ‘‘CROOK’’ Act, the
Kleptocrat Exposure Act, and the Rodchenkov
Anti-Doping Act have all been the result of a
focus by Commissioners and Commission
staff on developing a bipartisan congressional
response to the existential threat of global
authoritarianism.
We can no longer sit idly by, content that
those who wish to do us harm are on the
other side of the world. In this new age of au-
tocracy, the threat is here—now—and it
comes in the form of abusive Red Notices,
dirty money, and bought-and-paid-for lawfare
tactics The purpose of these tactics is to si-
lence journalists and activists, hollow out the
rule of law, and ensure that no one ever dare
pursue this new class of transnational
kleptocrats whose sole goal is the wholesale
looting of the countries they claim to serve
and the seamless transfer of those ill-gotten
gains to our shores and those of our allies.

HONORING GAREN AND SHARALYN
STAGLIN
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, September 16, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Garen and
Sharalyn Staglin for decades of mental health
philanthropy and advocacy and to recognize
their mental health research non-profit, One
Mind, in its twenty-fifth year.
Mr. and Ms. Staglin met at the University of
California Los Angeles, where he graduated
with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering and
she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in
International Relations. Mr. Staglin then re-
ceived an MBA with an emphasis in Finance
and Systems Analysis from the Stanford Uni-
versity Graduate School of Business. In 1975,
Ms. Staglin graduated from New York Univer-
sity with a Master of Public Administration and
in 1985, she did graduate work at University of
California Davis, where she focused on viticul-
ture and enology. In 1985 Mr. and Ms. Staglin
founded Staglin Family Vineyard.
The entire Staglin family have dedicated
themselves to mental health advocacy and
philanthropy, which they view as an obligation
to give back. In 1990 the Staglins’ son Bran-
don was diagnosed with schizophrenia and
twenty-five years ago, the family founded One
Mind, a non-profit that focuses on cures for
brain illnesses and injuries and promotes sci-
entific collaborations. The goal of One Mind is
to create a research paradigm that can be
replicated for research of different brain dis-
eases and injuries. They also began hosting
the annual Music Festival for Brain Health
twenty-five years ago. By parlaying their pro-
fessional success and relationships, the
Staglins have raised more than $400 million,
which has been given to mental health re-
search and charities. In 2017, Mr. Staglin
began One Mind at Work, which offers a guide
of best practices for improving workplace men-
tal health. Brandon currently serves as the Di-
rector of Marketing Communications, over-
seeing web design, content, and development,
at both One Mind and Staglin Family Vine-
yards. He has won national awards for his
work in the mental health sphere.
Mr. and Ms. Staglin have received numer-
ous awards for their work. In May of 2018 they
received the Ellis Island Honor Society Award,
which recognizes people’s accomplishments
within their field. They also received the Life-
time Achievement Award from the United

advance mental health and brain research.
Madam Speaker, Mr. and Ms. Staglin are

to furthering research and ending stigma. It is
