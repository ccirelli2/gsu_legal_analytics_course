CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF GARY
LEE MITCHELL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the life of Gary Lee
Mitchell, who passed away on March
13, 2019.
Gary was born in Jacksonville, Illi-
nois, and was the son of the late Eldred
Dale Mitchell and the late Mary Green
McGath. Gary served in the United
States Navy from 1965 to 1972 aboard
the USS Nathaniel Green submarine as
a nuclear reactor operator.
Gary worked with Duke Energy for 43
years, where he was known as the resi-
dent expert in the field of nuclear en-
ergy and oversaw mentoring new in-
terns coming into the field. Gary was
awarded the prestigious J.B. Duke
Award, which recognized his career
knowledge of how to react to critical
situations in saving a coworker from
serious injury or death.
Gary lived a life of service to others
and voluntarily joined many organiza-
tions, including the American Legion
in 1972, where he served as district
commander at the South Carolina De-
partment American Legion. He served
as zone commander and all vice com-
mander levels. On June 2, at the 94th
annual convention held in Greenville,
South Carolina, Gary was elected de-
partment commander of the South
Carolina American Legion Department.
Gary was married to Marlene A.
Mitchell for over 50 years and had two
daughters, Stephanie and Stacy, and
his grandchildren, Victoria, Alexan-
dria, and Mitchell Friel. In describing
what type of husband Gary Mitchell
was to his wife, Marlene, she stated
that ‘‘he was her best friend and was
the kindest person she ever knew.’’
The world is a better and kinder
place because of the life of Gary Lee
Mitchell, and he was a man who served
his God, his family, and his country.

NOW IS THE TIME FOR CONGRESS
TO ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise, a proud American, and
I rise because I love my country.
Mr. Speaker, as I stand here today, I
would call to the attention of those
who are within the view of what we are
doing the fact that we are now some 35
days since the Mueller report has been
made public. It was released before
that, but it has been made public some
35 days.
This means that, for 35 days now,
this administration has been above the
law if we allow the genesis of the start
to be the date that the report was
issued to the public, made public.
The Mueller report is clear: The
President was not exonerated when it
comes to obstruction of justice. The
Mueller report, in essence, has given
this Congress the opportunity to fulfill
its constitutional responsibility. That
responsibility is to take up the cause of
justice.
The Framers of the Constitution in-
tended for the Congress of the United
States of America to be the place
where the balance of power is main-
tained. We are the check on the Presi-
dent, such that we can maintain the
balance of power. It was never intended
that there be a concentration of power
within the executive branch to the ex-
tent that it is being concentrated by
virtue of the actions of this President.
Allow me to explain.
This President has refused to honor
subpoenas.
He has encouraged witnesses not to
appear.
He has encouraged persons to avoid
the responsibility that they have as
holders of public trust, the Secretary
of the Treasury to produce documents.
He is engaging and is encouraging
others to engage in a coverup. This is a
coverup. We, the Members of this au-
gust body, have a duty and a responsi-
bility not to allow this coverup to con-
tinue.
When we took our oath of office, we
said, by and through that oath, that we
would defend this Constitution. Article
II, Section 4 of the Constitution ac-
cords us the power to check the Presi-
dent so as to maintain the balance of
power. When we refuse to do so or if we
decline to do so or if we just don’t, for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4070 May 22, 2019
whatever reasons, do so, we are not liv-
ing up to our responsibilities.
Article II, Section 4 deals with im-
peachment. It is time for this Congress
to start the impeachment process. I
have been very adamant about this. I
stand where I have stood now for more
than 2 years. I have been said to be the
voice of impeachment in the Congress.
I am not the voice. The Members of
this body will be the voice of impeach-
ment when and if we take it up, and I
assure you we will. If nobody else does,
I will.
But the point is, this is our moment.
This is what we have been mandated to
do, to bring impeachment before the
House of Representatives, especially
given that we said we would wait until
the Mueller report was finished, and
then we would act.
Well, time has lapsed, and this is the
time for us to act. We are the Members
who can make the difference. This is
the Congress of the United States of
America.
Let me add this. I know these are dif-
ficult times for a good many persons
and there are those who question
whether we should do this given what
the Senate may do. Well, we do a lot of
things knowing that the Senate will
not act as we would have them act. We
send bills to the Senate quite routinely
knowing that the Senate will reject
these bills.
But it is our responsibility to act,
and we then allow the Senate to do its
job. If the Senate chooses not to, that
is on the Senate. The House will have
performed its responsibility.
So let us not be guided by political
expediency, the question of whether
the Senate is going to act. Let us stand
on the moral imperative that we have
to act.
Some have said that the soul of the
country is at risk. Well, the truth is
this, before the soul of the country is
lost, the soul of the House of Rep-
resentatives will be lost if we do not
act on this moral imperative.
This is what we must do to maintain
the House of Representatives’ integrity
and its prowess as a coequal branch of
the government, which some say has a
little bit more authority than the exec-
utive by virtue of its having a check on
the executive.
Mr. Speaker, each day that I come, I
will show the amount of time that has
lapsed during which this administra-
tion is engaged in a coverup and is
above the law.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
RECOGNIZING THE NEW HOPE-
SOLEBURY MIDDLE SCHOOL RO-
BOTICS CLUB
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize an outstanding
group of citizens in Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, who are actively en-
gaged in academic achievement.
Last year, New Hope-Solebury Middle
School established its robotics club,
and it did not take long for that club
to grow and find success. They quickly
grew to 20 students strong, with 5 stu-
dents recently awarded the Judges
Award at the competitive VEX Robot-
ics Competition.
The robotics club at New Hope-
Solebury Middle School is looking to
build off of its accomplishments. With
the help of librarian Craig Smith and
school board member Mark Cowell,
members are looking to become more
active in competitions to demonstrate
their skills. Recently, the
Lambertville-New Hope Rotary Club, of
which Mark is a member, held a fund-
raiser to assist these kids in reaching
their goals.
I would like to congratulate members
of the New Hope-Solebury Middle
School robotics club on their achieve-
ments. I would like to thank Mark and
Craig and members of the
Lambertville-New Hope Rotary Club
for their vision.
RECOGNIZING WALTER WYDRO FOR HIS STEAD-
FAST COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY SERVICE
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a citizen of
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for his
steadfast commitment to community
service.
Walter Wydro, a resident of Upper
Makefield, has been a constant pres-
ence in local initiatives for 50 years.
Walter has been a champion for land
preservation and played a significant
role in open space efforts in Upper
Makefield Township.
Since 1972, Walter has served on the
Upper Makefield Planning Commission.
He was also a founding member of the
Newtown Area Zoning Jointure, the
first of its kind in the State of Penn-
sylvania.
In 2004, Walter was named Upper
Makefield’s Volunteer of the Year and,
in 2005, he joined the Bucks County
Planning Commission. His work has
been so impactful and his reach and ex-
pertise so great that the Bucks County
Commissioners declared May 7, 2019,
Walter Wydro Day.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have
the privilege to represent such a
thoughtful and compassionate con-
stituent as Walter, and I thank Walter
for his innumerable contributions to
our community.
RECOGNIZING BEN HARDER FOR HIS STRENGTH
AND PERSEVERANCE
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise to recognize an outstanding resi-
dent from Bucks County, Pennsyl-
vania, who is teaching us all about
strength and perseverance.
Ben Harder, a resident of Levittown,
recently participated in the Kiwanis-
Herald Sesame Place Classic, which I
was honored to attend. This was Ben’s
21st consecutive year participating in
the 5K race, an event cherished by our
local community. His presence this
year was made remarkable, however,
due to the fact that Ben is currently
undergoing chemotherapy for pan-
creatic cancer.
Mr. Speaker, Ben is no stranger to
athletic feats. While a student at The
University of Southern Mississippi, he
was also a top-ranked power lifter for
his weight class.
I would like to honor Ben for his
strength and his spirit in the face of
adversity, and our entire community is
praying for him as he undergoes treat-
ment.
I would also like to extend our best
wishes to Ben’s family, including his
siblings, Arthur, Chloebelle, Rosen, and
Eleanor.
f
RECOGNIZING THE COLOMBIA
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. PRO-
GRAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to speak about the Martin Luther
King, Jr. program in Colombia and to
recognize the tremendous leadership of
my friend and colleague from New
York, Congressman GREG MEEKS.
The Martin Luther King, Jr. program
is a modest project funded by the
United States Agency for International
Development. It provides scholarships
to outstanding Afro-Colombian and in-
digenous students to learn English as a
second language and receive leadership
training. The program began in 2006
and has supported over 370 students.
While leading a bipartisan delegation
to Colombia in April, Congressman
MEEKS and I, along with five of our col-
leagues, had the opportunity to meet
with young people participating in the
program and hear firsthand the im-
pacts this program has had on their
community.
The students told us how their expe-
rience with the MLK program went far
beyond just learning English. They
have developed important leadership
skills, which they have used to launch
successful community improvement
projects and to become role models in
their neighborhoods.
They told us how the program fosters
an environment in which the students
learn from one another about how to
make a positive difference in the lives
of others.
I want to recognize my good friend
and colleague, Congressman MEEKS,
who led the effort to establish this pro-
gram back in 2006. While in Colombia
last month, Mr. MEEKS spoke passion-
ately to the students about how they
are the future of Colombia. Thanks in
no small part to Mr. MEEKS’ efforts,
that future now looks very bright.
Congressman MEEKS’ leadership has
been essential, not only to the success
of this program, but to supporting Co-
lombia’s democratic progress over the
last two decades and strengthening the
U.S.-Colombia partnership. His tireless
dedication to the underserved commu-
nities has been critical, and I am proud
to serve alongside him.

May 22, 2019
b 1015
While there is still a great deal of
work to be done, Congressman MEEKS
has helped the Colombian Government
establish a society based on the rule of
law.
He has worked to ensure that the
voices of Afro-Colombians and other
historically marginalized populations
are heard. He has helped inspire a new
and more diverse generation of leader-
ship.
I look forward to seeing the contin-
ued impact of this tremendous effort. I
am hopeful that these Martin Luther
King, Jr., scholars will become leaders
not only in their communities but of
their country.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman
MEEKS for his hard work, his passion,
and his dedication to educating, inspir-
ing, and supporting leaders of tomor-
row.
f
TAKE ACTION TO RESTORE
FLORIDA’S WATER QUALITY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. WALTZ) for 5 minutes.
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, when
Members think of my home State of
Florida, they think of water. From our
beaches to our springs to our lakes and
our rivers, Florida’s waterways stretch
far and wide, covering nearly 26,000
miles.
Florida’s Sixth District, my district,
is no exception, with miles of Atlantic
Coast to the east and bordered by the
St. Johns River to the west.
From the Matanzas River marsh to
the Everglades, water is at the heart of
Florida’s ecosystem and its natural
beauty. People are drawn to Florida’s
water, and the numbers prove it. One
thousand people per day move to the
Sunshine State, with a record 126 mil-
lion people visiting Florida last year.
Tourism drives our economy, and
Florida’s tourism is dependent on clean
water and its natural resources.
Unfortunately, our water quality is
threatened right now. We saw a new
blue-green algae bloom erupt in the St.
Johns River just last month. While it
is too early to know exactly the spe-
cific cause of this incident, we do know
what causes algae blooms, and there
are steps the government can and
should take to prevent them.
This is why I am focusing my efforts
to remove septic tanks from my dis-
trict and connecting those commu-
nities to new sewer utilities.
I am grateful for our State law-
makers and Governor Ron DeSantis,
who prioritized water quality this year,
putting $49 million toward water qual-
ity and wastewater grants and $25 mil-
lion specifically for septic-to-sewer
conversions. These conversions will
have a positive impact by lessening
discharges since septic leakage con-
tributes to these growing algae blooms
and these growing algae problems.
We must leverage these State re-
sources with Federal funds to address
the full needs of Florida. We have the
Water Infrastructure Finance and In-
novation Act program and State Clean
Water Revolving Fund program, but
they need to be better focused and bet-
ter utilized to address this issue.
We have to do more. That is why I re-
quested much-needed funding for our
National Estuary Program, which
funds the Indian River Lagoon, in the
fiscal year 2020 appropriations bill. The
Indian River Lagoon in my district
has, unfortunately, fallen victim to
septic leakage and requires a plan for
restoring water quality.
The National Estuary Program sup-
ports and will help maintain healthy
water and estuary ecosystems like the
Indian River Lagoon.
Alongside many of my Florida dele-
gation colleagues, I supported the $200
million funding request for the Ever-
glades restoration project in April, and
I am glad President Trump has amend-
ed his budget to include the Ever-
glades. Everglades restoration is de-
pendent on cleaning Lake Okeechobee
and its discharges, which impact water
along our coast.
I also commend my colleagues on the
Appropriations Committee for passing
the Energy and Water bill yesterday,
which includes that $200 million figure.
These requests will go directly toward
improving Florida’s waterways across
the State and areas like the Indian
River Lagoon, if signed into law.
I am hopeful that, here in Congress,
we can get this legislation passed
through the House, passed through the
Senate, and onto the President’s desk
for signature. It is the right thing to do
for communities along the St. Johns
River and necessary for maintaining
the travel and tourism that drives
Florida’s economy.
We must restore Florida’s water
quality and take this issue very seri-
ously.
f
RECOGNIZING CHANCELLOR
LELAND
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor a true pioneer in education at
the University of California at Merced,
the newest campus not only in Cali-
fornia but among the newest in the
country.
Dorothy Leland, our chancellor, is
retiring, but she has paved the way for
this newest university.
Chancellor Leland and her staff have
built a community at UC Merced that
is very special. More than 44 percent of
the faculty are women. Over the past 5
years, the number of graduate students
attending the university has increased
by nearly 75 percent.
Probably most impressive of all, I
think, is that nearly 75 percent of the
students are the first in their families
to attend university, and a majority of
these are minorities. It is a majority-
minority campus.
As a child of Mexican immigrants
herself and the first in her family to
graduate from college, Chancellor Le-
land feels a real connection to the stu-
dent body. She is outspoken about
DACA students, with almost 600 DACA
students in the university today. She
even traveled here to our Nation’s Cap-
ital to fight on behalf of Dreamers.
She is one of the founding members
of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher
Education and Immigration, a group of
more than 200 leaders who support poli-
cies that help immigrant, undocu-
mented, and international students
succeed at U.S. universities and col-
leges.
In her retirement, she said she wants
to work on immigration reform. We
can use that help.
But her work for the students and
the campus at UC Merced does not end
there. Arriving in 2011 during the Great
Recession, Chancellor Leland imme-
diately went to work on developing the
university, because of the importance
of this campus to the San Joaquin Val-
ley, with a major construction project.
She fought for $1.3 billion in funding to
help expand the university, including
the construction of new dorm rooms,
research labs, a conference center, and
an athletic facility. That project has
allowed the university to expand from
5,000 to over 8,000 students and doubled
the size of the campus.
She has also succeeded in graduation
rates, which are up by 12 percent dur-
ing her tenure. I am proud to say that,
last weekend, over 1,300 students grad-
uated.
UC Merced has achieved impressive
levels of academic and research dis-
tinction and is developing numerous
new patents and leading cutting-edge
research.
I would also like to take this oppor-
tunity to give another shout-out, and
that is to President Joe Castro and the
faculty and the student body at Fresno
State, home of the Bulldogs.
This past weekend, Fresno State
graduated over 6,000 students, the larg-
est in the school’s history. Over 25,000
students are enrolled at Fresno State,
ranked by Washington Monthly last
year as one of the top 25 campuses in
the United States.
Most importantly, more than 60 per-
cent of the graduating students are the
first in their generation to attend and
graduate from university.
Both these universities are serving
our Nation and doing what, in fact,
they should be doing, which is edu-
cating and training our Nation’s next
generation of leaders who will make a
difference and who will make America
a better place.
I am honored to represent such suc-
cessful universities in my district, and
I am proud of both these leaders, the
faculties, and the student bodies be-
cause they represent the future of
America.
Go Bobcats, and go Bulldogs.
RECONSIDER FUNDING LEVELS FOR FEMA AND
CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, let me note
that the President’s action this week
VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:24 May 23, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K22MY7.005 H22MYPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4072 May 22, 2019
as it relates to funding for FEMA and
California’s wildfires, as well as the
funding for the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture in terms of where
those moneys go for forestry, is wrong.
It is wrong; it is punitive; and it is
painful.
For the fires in California, 60 percent
are on U.S. forestry land. Therefore, to
be responsible, the United States needs
to do its part when these horrific fires
take place.
We do the same with hurricanes. We
do the same with tornadoes. We do the
same with floods. So it seems to me
that the President ought to reconsider
his actions toward California.
We are partners in trying to manage
both State and Federal lands not only
in California but around the country.
Therefore, the President’s actions
should be reconsidered.
It should not be punitive toward Cali-
fornia because, through no fault of our
own, we have had to deal with these
horrific circumstances, just like other
regions of the country have to deal
with natural disasters that are through
no fault of their own.
Let’s reconsider, Mr. President. Let’s
not be punitive toward California be-
cause of the tremendous devastation
that these fires have created.
f
REMEMBERING THE FALLEN THIS
MEMORIAL DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, this weekend marks one
of our most solemn occasions, Memo-
rial Day, where we mourn those we
have lost in the defense of this Nation.
Many in this House will attend cere-
monies throughout the weekend and on
Memorial Day, which is observed annu-
ally on the last Monday of May.
The traditional Memorial Day dates
back to 1864 in Boalsburg, Pennsyl-
vania, my home county, where three
ladies decorated the graves of fallen
Civil War soldiers. The custom has con-
tinued every year since then.
Boalsburg still puts on a traditional
Memorial Day celebration, complete
with a parade, a community walk to
the cemetery, speeches, military re-
enactments, and much more.
We must never forget the unthink-
able pain for the families whose loved
ones have not returned home, and this
includes those missing in action and
prisoners of war. Currently, there are
more than 83,000 American service-
members who remain unaccounted for
from World War II, the Korean war,
and Vietnam.
While several nations have worked to
assist the United States in search and
recovery efforts, many challenges still
exist when it comes to negotiations
and operations. That is why today I
will introduce the Keeping Our Prom-
ise to MIAs/POWs resolution that ex-
presses a sense of Congress that any
nation seeking to potentially enter
into a mutually beneficial trade agree-
ment with the United States should
provide reasonable access and coopera-
tion to help us recover our unac-
counted-for servicemembers.
This resolution sends a message that
this Nation will uphold its eternal
promise to our Armed Forces to always
work to bring our men and women
home, no matter the circumstances we
face, no matter the time that has
passed.
I urge my colleagues to support this
resolution, especially in advance of Me-
morial Day weekend. Mr. Speaker,
America will gather this weekend with
family members, friends, and neighbors
to remember those whom we have lost.
As we raise the Stars and Stripes, as
we lay wreaths at monuments and me-
morials and cemeteries, as we march in
parades and attend services, let us re-
member that our freedom is thanks to
those who died in sacrifice.
May God bless them, and may God
bless the United States of America.
f
HONORING ALICE RIVLIN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. SHALALA) for 5 minutes.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
celebrate the life of one of the greatest
public servants of any age, the indomi-
table Alice Rivlin, who died of cancer
last week.
An intellectual giant with Mid-
western sensibilities, she had a resume
that would never be matched: Assist-
ant Secretary for Policy and Evalua-
tion at HEW, founding Director of the
Congressional Budget Office, Director
of the Office of Management and Budg-
et, president of the American Eco-
nomic Association, and Vice Chair of
the Federal Reserve.
In between her government service,
she sat on a high perch at the Brook-
ings Institution, producing rigorous,
centrist, and insightful books and arti-
cles on a wide range of Federal poli-
cies.
In her spare time, she was credited
with saving D.C. from bankruptcy. She
never forgot her responsibility to her
adopted hometown.
Alice was deeply respected and be-
loved by her peers and politicians of
both parties. She was one of the first
recipients of a MacArthur Foundation
genius award, a tribute to her skill in
building one of the most important
public institutions of our lifetime, the
CBO.
Her sustained contributions to public
policy analysis have fundamentally
shaped our thinking about the impact
of public programs and the budget.
b 1030
She also constantly reminded us that
when we refuse to use evidence in mak-
ing policy decisions, we do so at our
country’s peril.
Alice Rivlin was my dear friend. I
met her here in D.C. as a newly minted
Ph.D. She was already famous for her
classic book, ‘‘Systematic Thinking for
Social Action.’’
She was funny, warm, generous, and
welcoming. She wanted all of us new-
comers to love her adopted city as
much as she did.
When I returned to Washington to
join the Clinton Cabinet, Alice, along
with her friend Meg Greenfield, the
powerhouse editorial page editor of the
Post, and Post publisher Katherine
Graham, formed the Smart Women’s
Club. They invited me to join them in
hilarious dinners with interesting
guests, a high point in my career.
One of my fondest memories of Alice
took place on a day in the 1980s when I
was still in New York. She called me
and asked if I could take a month off to
go to Kashmir to trek in the
Himalayas. What an adventure, the be-
ginning of decades of trekking in some
of the most interesting places on Earth
with friends and her patient husband,
Sid Winter, himself a world-class econ-
omist.
You learn a lot about people when
you share a narrow ledge in a rain-
storm on some of the highest moun-
tains in the world. Alice was tenacious,
brave, cheerful, and the kindest and
nicest person I have ever known.
She was a legend, renowned for men-
toring younger colleagues and helping
people of all walks of life with their
challenges.
Hers was more than a life well lived.
She was a patriot who loved her coun-
try and her city, and she served both
with extraordinary skill and passion.

HONORING 320TH BARRAGE
BALLOON BATTALION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. VEASEY) for 5 minutes.
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in honor of Memorial Day and
the upcoming 75th anniversary of D-
day to recognize and raise awareness
about the 320th Barrage Balloon Bat-
talion. It was an all-Black battalion
that made considerable contributions
during D-day.
Until recently, the 320th battalion’s
sacrifices and bravery have been vir-
tually unrecognized. Until the recent
book ‘‘Forgotten: The Untold Story of
D-Day’s Black Heroes, at Home and at
War’’ by Linda Hervieux, the story had
really gone untold. People didn’t really
know about it.
It is notable that one of the soldiers
who is featured in the book—his name
is Wilson Monk—his quote to the au-
thor when she called him was, ‘‘I’ve
been waiting for this call for over 50
years.’’
When we look back at the social in-
justices of the 1940s during Jim Crow,
it is clear that the social discrimina-
tion created momentum for the civil
rights protests in the 1950s and 1960s.

gomery and the words of Dr. Martin
Luther King, the social injustices that

were in the news—sadly, always in the
news—are documented very well in our
textbooks, but much of the military
discrimination against African Ameri-
cans was not documented very well.
I want to take a minute today to
thank those African American soldiers
who fought during World War II for
their valor and sacrifice for our coun-
try.
You may not have heard of the 320th
battalion, but on the morning of June
6, 1944, the unit of African American
soldiers landed on the beaches of
France. Their orders were to man a
curtain of armed balloons meant to
deter enemy aircraft. They flew at an
altitude of about 200 feet to defend sol-
diers landing on the beaches against
strafing attacks by German aircraft.
The battalion served 140 days in
France.
One member of the 320th battalion
wounded in battle, Waverly B. Wood-
son, Jr., would later be nominated for
the Medal of Honor, an award he would
never receive.
The Nation’s highest decorations
were not given to African American
soldiers in World War II. Members of
the 320th battalion, the first African
American battalion, which included
hundreds of soldiers, were sent abroad
to fight for liberties denied to them at
home.
The story of the 320th battalion is a
narrative of perseverance in the face of
injustice.
Earlier this week, I had the pleasure
to be invited by Representative KATH-
ERINE CLARK from Massachusetts to go
hear the story of ‘‘D-Day Girls: The
Spies Who Armed the Resistance, Sabo-
taged the Nazis, and Helped Win World
War II’’ by women who played a very
crucial role in the military and
spycraft that helped us during World
War II. Of course, throughout time,
much of their role was relegated to
being said that they were secretaries
and answered phones, but they played
very critical roles.
I know one of my former constitu-
ents who passed away not too long ago,
Robert Starr, was part of an ambula-
tory crew that helped pick up the
wounded and remains of people who
were dead on the beaches of Normandy.
Again, the story told was that African
American soldiers worked in that role
but that they were not part of the ini-
tial invasion.
Sadly, that has been memorialized in
Hollywood, as well. I think one of the
best movies about D-day of all time is
‘‘The Longest Day,’’ a great, great
movie. But, of course, there were no
African American soldiers depicted in
that movie. ‘‘Saving Private Ryan,’’
another great movie, but, again, no Af-
rican American soldiers were depicted
in that movie, sadly.
It is my hope that we can raise more
awareness about the 320th Barrage Bal-
loon Battalion, these men who fought
so bravely during World War II, so that
they, too, will not just be memorialized
in the textbooks but that their story
will be brought to Hollywood.
I am certain that there is a Rob
Reiner or a Steven Spielberg or a Spike
Lee or someone out there who will help
tell the story of these women who
fought during World War II and helped
the resistance and also these African
American soldiers whose stories have
not been told.
It is absolutely amazing to me that
there are many African Americans in
this country even who, if you ask
them, they think that there were no
Black soldiers who fought during D-
day. It is a story that has been allowed
to be falsely perpetuated for far too
long. It is time that we raise awareness
about the 320th battalion and the great
sacrifices that they made for this coun-
try.

CONGRATULATING MEL SHOWERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BYRNE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Mel Showers upon
his retirement from WKRG in Mobile,
Alabama, after a remarkable 50-year
career.
Mel holds a special place in the
hearts of many in southwest Alabama
and the Florida panhandle. So many
grew up watching his reporting and
grew to trust him over the years.
Mel’s career is notable not only be-
cause of its length, but also because of
the barriers he overcame to become
one of the first African American re-
porters and, later, anchors in the Deep
South. A man of lesser perseverance
and integrity could not have overcome
these obstacles with such grace.
Mel deserves our utmost respect, and
we will miss seeing him every evening.
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mel. I
offer my heartfelt thanks for his many
contributions to our community over
the years, and I wish him the best of
luck in his retirement.
REMEMBERING BILLY MIDDLETON
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to mourn the loss of the long-
time mayor of Loxley, Alabama, Billy
Middleton. After a long, hard-fought
battle, Mayor Middleton succumbed to
cancer last week at 78 years old.
Billy was first elected mayor in 1988,
and before his passing, he was serving a
remarkable seventh term.
His longevity was no accident. A
former marine, Mayor Middleton was a
true public servant whose dedication to
his community extended far beyond his
official duties and endeared him to the
people of southwest Alabama. His com-
munity is better because he was a part
of it.
Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincerest
condolences to his wife, Lilly, and the
many family and friends he leaves be-
hind. Billy’s memory and service to the
close-knit town of Loxley will last long
beyond his death.

Kansas, offered the following prayer:
O God, we pause to recall and thank
You for the blessings we have enjoyed
down through the ages. These blessings
You give us so often come by the hand
of others.
Thank You for the Honorable men
and women of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and all those in service of
our great Nation.
As we approach Memorial Day, we
gratefully remember men and women
of the Armed Forces of the past, the
present, and future.
Let us remember greatness is not the
number of people that serve us but the
number of people that we serve. Look-
ing to past servants, let us do well the
task that has been given our hands to
do. May the season of graduation in-
spire us to grow in knowledge in order
to equip ourselves as servants and citi-
zens for God and country.

RECOGNIZING HER EMINENCE
ROBIAMNY BALCACER
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Her Eminence
Robiamny Balcacer, the Dominican Re-
public’s first female Minister of Youth
in the nation’s history.
Since a young age, Minister Balcacer
has been critical in youth political and
social welfare activities within her
community of Las Guaranas.
After graduating college with a bach-
elor’s degree in business administra-
tion and a master’s degree in public
management and modern public admin-
istration techniques, she was elected
councilwoman in 2006 and, eventually,
elected president of the Councilmem-
bers Board, becoming the youngest
woman in history to lead it.
As Minister of Youth, she has quick-
ly garnered praise for her work in low-
income communities throughout the
Dominican Republic. She has invested
in social and workforce development
programs intended to reduce crime and
strengthen community relationships,
including constructing brand-new com-
munity computing centers and play-
grounds.
Her work has attracted the attention
of Dominican American community
leaders in my district and all across
the country, and I had the honor of
meeting Minister Balcacer this morn-
ing. I am glad that she is joining us
today in the gallery as her work is
being recognized here on the House
floor.
Mr. Speaker, I welcome Minister
Balcacer.

CONGRATULATING BRAD FARMER
ON HIS RETIREMENT
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
Brad Farmer, who has spent the last 38
years of his life in service to the Boy
Scouts of America, and to congratulate
him on his retirement. It is because of
people like Brad that Scouting has
been able to positively influence the
lives of millions of young American
men and women.
Brad began his service in 1981 as a
district executive in Wood River, Illi-
nois, and has served Scouting in sev-
eral local and national roles since then.
Brad most recently served in the Na-
tional Office of the Boy Scouts, where
he was Assistant Chief Scout Executive
for Development from 2009 until earlier
this year. Brad was also charged with
overseeing the Boy Scouts of America
sustainability and outdoor stewardship
efforts.
Mr. Speaker, over the last 10 years,
Brad has provided incredible service
and leadership. Brad leaves tremendous
shoes to fill, but I congratulate him on
a well deserved retirement.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Brad for his
contributions to the Boy Scouts of
America and our Nation’s youth.

RECOGNIZING THE 10-YEAR
ANNIVERSARY OF THE CARD ACT
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute
and to revise and extend her remarks.)
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago today
in the midst of the Great Recession,
millions of credit card holders got
some needed relief when President
Obama signed into law the Credit Card
Accountability, Responsibility, and
Disclosure Act, the CARD Act.
Before the CARD Act, some banks
took advantage of their customers. For
example, they raised rates and changed
the terms of contracts without any no-
tice to the customer. They even raised
rates retroactively on existing bal-
ances.
The CARD Act changed that, barring
many unfair and deceptive practices:
no more retroactive rate hikes, no
more extra fees for paying bills online
or on the phone, no more aggressive
marketing tactics targeting young peo-
ple.
The CARD Act has saved consumers
an estimated $12 billion a year, which
translates into well over $100 billion in
total savings over the past decade. It is
the first 10 years, and we are cele-
brating this consumer protection act.
f
PROGROWTH POLICIES WORK
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to talk about the state of the economy
and how progrowth policies are helping
my district.
A headline last month on CNBC read:
‘‘Jobs Surge in April, Unemployment
Rate Falls to the Lowest Since 1969.’’
The U.S. added 263,000 new hires last
month, including over 13,000 jobs in
North Carolina. On top of that, the
labor participation rate increased.
Many people are coming off the side-
lines and into the workforce, and the
manufacturing output continues to go
up.
Mr. Speaker, when we cut taxes,
slash red tape, and give employers
more certainty, they are able to em-
ploy more people. This just isn’t rocket
science.
Just a few days ago, my district re-
ceived great news. Honda Aircraft an-
nounced plans to expand its global
headquarters in Greensboro by invest-
ing $15.5 million in a new facility on its
campus. This will be a huge boost for
Guilford County, and that is why we
cannot afford to go backwards.
Tax cuts work.
Progrowth policies work.

HONORING NANCY K. JOHNSON
(Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, this
weekend we will be celebrating the life
and legacy of one of my exceptional
constituents, Nancy K. Johnson, who
left us on January 10 of this year.
Nancy was truly a force to be reck-
oned with. Born in Chicago, she later
moved to Santa Maria, California, with
her husband, Ned, where they raised
five children.
She was very active in the commu-
nity and was a founding member of the
Santa Maria Valley League of Women
Voters, a board member and counselor
at Planned Parenthood, a member of
the Pismo Beach Presbyterian Church,
and a nationally recognized city and
county planning commissioner.
Nancy also volunteered her time with
the Santa Barbara Foundation, Transi-
tions-Mental Health, SBCAN, and the
Women’s Fund for North County.
She had a true passion for the arts
and was a longtime supporter of PCPA
community theater and the Santa
Maria Symphony.
It was an honor to know and work
with Nancy. Nancy will always be re-
membered for her passion and work to-
wards justice and equality for all.

trict, Ryan Dierker.
After 4 years in my office, Ryan will
be leaving at the end of the month for
a higher calling. He will be going to Of-

WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN
HOUSING
(Mr. CLAY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to introduce a resolution recognizing
women and minorities in housing, ac-
knowledging their efforts in the face of
historical discrimination, and pro-
moting diversity and inclusion in busi-
ness.
Although the U.S. has become more
demographically diverse, the financial
services industry, especially at leader-
ship levels, remains mostly White and
male.
President Johnson signed the Fair
Housing Act on April 11, 1968, 1 week
after the assassination of Dr. King. The
Fair Housing Act was a monumental
step forward for the civil rights move-
ment and pivotal to establishing equal
opportunity in housing for all Ameri-
cans.
Home ownership has proven to be one
of the most consistent paths to obtain-
ing wealth in America and narrowing
the wealth gap. Closing the racial
wealth gap will be an essential path to-
wards countering historic discrimina-
tion and predatory lending.

IN MEMORY OF RONNIE YOUNG
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, South Carolina is commemo-
rating the life of Ronnie Young, who
was a model public servant who genu-
inely loved the people he represented.
State Representative Young of Aiken
County entered into rest on Sunday.
He was a native of Aiken County, hav-
ing made the valley community his
lifelong residence. He was a member of
Sweetwater Church of God.
He was a full-time legislator for Dis-
trict 84 in the State house. Previously,
he had been elected countywide as
chairman of Aiken County Council.
His civic involvement included the
Graniteville Exchange Club, Aiken Ro-
tary Club, Midland Valley Lions Club,
Midland Valley Chamber of Commerce,
and the Has-Been Club.
He is survived by his wife of 48 years,
Susan Napier Young, and a sister, Pa-
tricia Boyd of Warrenville.
Ronnie Young will always be cher-
ished for his successful dedication to
public service.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS
ACCOUNTING STANDARD
(Mr. LUETKEMEYER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker,
today I rise to discuss an issue that is
probably on the radar for almost every-
body in this country that is watching
or listening, but it involves new ac-
counting standards being proposed
called CECL.
This is supposed to put some trans-
parency into the balance sheet for peo-
ple investing in banks, but it has a far-
reaching impact in credit unions, debt
collection, and all sorts of other funds,
including the GSEs and credit cards;
yet this accounting standard is being
promoted by the Federal Accounting
Standards Board without any study to
show whether it is going to have an im-
pact or not on our economy and on our
consumers.
The Home Builders Association says,
for every $1,000 incoming into the cost
of a home loan, 100,000 people across
this country will no longer have access
to home loans.
What a dramatic impact on low- to
moderate-income folks as well as our
economy as a whole, as well as to fi-
nancial institutions as a whole.
The result of this, in other words,
whenever this thing is implemented,
when we have a downturn in the econ-
omy and all of a sudden you have to re-
serve additional money because of
that, it will exacerbate, in my opinion,
the downturn.
This is a horrible deal. We need to
take another look at it. We need to
stop it and study it.

bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall not exceed 1

the chair and ranking minority mem-

Services.
The gentlewoman from California
(Ms. WATERS) and the gentleman from
Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER) each will

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of
H.R. 1500, the Consumers First Act,
which restores the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, so it can carry out
its mission of protecting consumers
from unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts
or practices by financial institutions.
The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau was created by Congress fol-
lowing the financial crisis in order to
ensure that there is an agency in place
with the sole, dedicated purpose of pro-
tecting every consumer of financial
products and services and holding bad
actors fully accountable when con-
sumers are harmed.
Under the leadership of its first Di-
rector, Richard Cordray, the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau was a re-
sounding success. During that time,
the agency put nearly $12 billion back
in the pockets of over 30 million con-
sumers who were harmed by financial
institutions. The agency put in place
important new protections so that con-
sumers no longer had to worry about
exploding mortgages, hidden prepaid
card fees, or unnecessary foreclosures
due to weak servicing standards.
The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau also helped to take the con-
fusing jargon out of various financial

products, such as student loans, by cre-
ating tools students can use to com-
pare financial aid and costs when de-
ciding where to go to college.
But Donald Trump and his ap-
pointees have made it their mission to
destroy the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau from within. Mick
Mulvaney, who was Trump’s Director
of the Office of Management and Budg-
et before Trump inappropriately in-
stalled him as Acting Director of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau, made it his mission to dismantle
the agency from the inside. In fact, en-
forcement actions have fallen by 75
percent under Trump’s appointees,
there have been zero public fair lending
enforcement actions, Mulvaney origi-
nally requested zero dollars from the
Fed to fund the CFPB, and the number
of employees at the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau has declined by
10 percent.
I introduced the Consumers First Act
to fix the damage that Mulvaney
caused at the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau. For example,
Mulvaney stripped the Office of Fair
Lending and Equal Opportunity of its
supervisory enforcement powers. The
Consumers First Act restores those
powers.
Mulvaney fired the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau’s consumer ad-
visory board. The Consumers First Act
restores and strengthens the advisory
panel to ensure consumers are heard by
the agency’s leadership.
Mulvaney stacked the senior leader-
ship of the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau with ideological political
appointees. The Consumers First Act
limits the number of political ap-
pointees at the agency.
Mulvaney stopped the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau from super-
vising its regulated entities for compli-
ance with the Military Lending Act,
which is in place to prevent service-
members from being ripped off. The
Consumers First Act directs the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau to
promptly resume Military Lending Act
exams.
Mulvaney worked to hide the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau’s
consumer complaint database from the
public. The Consumers First Act re-
quires that the consumer complaint
database remain publicly accessible so
that there is transparency about the
complaints consumers are making
about financial institutions.
H.R. 1500 puts consumers first by re-
versing the harmful actions Mulvaney
took that we are aware of one by one.
Over 50 consumer, civil rights, and
labor organizations support the Con-
sumers First Act.
The harm at the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau is continuing under
Director Kathy Kraninger, who appears
to be following Mulvaney’s lead by
rolling back payday lending protec-
tions and reducing the collection of the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or
HMDA data, which is used to identify
discrimination in lending. And she is
just getting started. Following general
debate on the bill, the House will de-
bate several amendments to undo the
harmful actions taken by Director
Kraninger.
Congress will not tolerate the Trump
administration’s anticonsumer actions,
and H.R. 1500 will ensure that the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau is
able to fulfill its statutory mission to
put consumers first.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.

DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS: I write con-
cerning H.R. 1500, the ‘‘Consumers First
Act.’’ This bill was primarily referred to the
Committee on Financial Services, and sec-
ondarily to the Committee on Education and
Labor. As a result of your having consulted

agree to forgo consideration of the bill, so
the bill may proceed expeditiously to the

The Committee takes this action with our
mutual understanding that by foregoing con-
sideration of H.R. 1500, we do not waive any
jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation, and we
will be appropriately consulted and involved

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES,
Washington, DC, May 21, 2019.
Hon. BOBBY SCOTT,
Chairman, House Committee on Education and
Labor, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I writing to acknowl-
edge your letter dated May 17, 2019, respond-
ing to our request to your Committee that it
waive any jurisdictional claims over the
matters contained in H.R. 1500, ‘‘the Con-
sumer First Act,’’ that fall within your Com-
mittee’s Rule X jurisdiction. The Committee
on Financial Services confirms our mutual
understanding that your Committee does not
waive any jurisdiction over the subject mat-
ter contained in this or similar legislation,
and your Committee will be appropriately
consulted and involved as this bill or similar
legislation moves forward so that we may
address any remaining issues within your ju-
risdiction.
The Committee on Financial Services fur-
ther recognizes your interest in appointment
of outside conferees from the Committee on
Education and Labor should this bill or simi-
lar language be considered in a conference
with the Senate.
Pursuant to your request, I will ensure
that this exchange of letters is included in
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD during Floor
consideration of the bill. I appreciate your
cooperation regarding this legislation and
look forward to continuing to work with you
as this measure moves through the legisla-
tive process.
Sincerely,
MAXINE WATERS,
Chairwomen.
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Since its inception, the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau has dis-
regarded congressional intent in a
number of alarming ways. Under the
previous Director, Richard Cordray,
the agency took it upon itself to essen-
tially write law through guidance and
regulate through enforcement. Bureau-
crats at the CFPB worked diligently to
eliminate options for Americans, arro-
gantly believing they were better
equipped to make financial decisions
than consumers themselves.
Thankfully, under Acting Director
Mulvaney and Director Kraninger, the
CFPB is striving to foster an environ-
ment that promotes transparency, le-
gitimacy, and great consumer choice.
The American people deserve a Bureau
that enforces law rather than creates
it, while placing power and choice back
in the hands of consumers themselves.
Unfortunately, the legislation we are
considering today accomplishes the
exact opposite.
I appreciate the chairwoman’s at-
tempt to reform the Bureau and share
the belief that it needs significant re-
form. However, instead of solving un-
derlying issues that make the CFPB an
unaccountable bureaucracy with little
oversight, this legislation cherry-picks
specific actions of former Acting Direc-
tor Mulvaney and attempts to reverse
his decisions.
Ignoring the underlying structural
issues of the Bureau, Democrats are at-
tempting to codify their CFPB agenda
with respect to staffing by limiting po-
litical appointees, directing political
initiatives through the creation of the
Office of Students and Young Con-
sumers, and emphasizing the powers
and duties of the Office of Fair Lending
and Equal Opportunity.
Yet again, my friends across the aisle
are more focused on who is leading the
agency than on real reforms that would
increase oversight and accountability
at the CFPB and could shed light on
some of the issues this legislation
seeks to address. For example, if the
CFPB were subject to an Office of In-
spector General, we would have reports
on whether or not staffing levels are
sufficient to fulfill the Bureau’s statu-
tory goals. If the Bureau was subject to
the appropriations process, Congress
would have a voice in choosing the
number of political appointees at the
Bureau. Some of these issues, Mr.
Chairman, are not even partisan,
they’re near bipartisan, and yet we
can’t get these things done.
Instead of working with Republicans
to reform the Bureau, create trans-
parency, and avoid partisan policy
shifts from Director to Director, the

majority is choosing to advance legis-
lation that mandates the advancement
of political priorities.
The bottom line here is the legisla-
tion before us is wholly partisan and
does nothing to ensure the CFPB can
carry out its mission to protect con-
sumers. I oppose this legislation and I
urge my colleagues to do so, as well.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY)
the chair of the Subcommittee on In-
vestor Protection, Entrepreneurship,
and Capital Markets.
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to revise and extend her remarks.)
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Chair, I thank the chair for
her strong support and leadership on
the Consumers First Act, H.R. 1500. I
urge everyone to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this if
they care about protecting consumers
from abuse.
Putting Mick Mulvaney in charge of
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau was the epitome of a fox guarding
the henhouse. We have to undo all of
the damage he did while he was Acting
Director of the CFPB.
The CFPB was supposed to, and did,
protect consumers and returned a great
deal of money to consumers. All of
these protections, or many of them, he
deleted. What this bill does is restore
these protections to consumers.
Let me remind my colleagues of why
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau was created. It was after the worst
financial crisis in our history, where
our people lost over $15 trillion in
household wealth. They lost their
homes, or they lost their jobs. It was
completely preventable because those
were abuses to the financial system.
The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau was a Bureau that was directed
to protect consumers. Consumers were
an afterthought, a secondary thought,
a third thought, or not thought about
at all in financial regulation. The
whole system exists for consumers, and
they certainly are entitled to be pro-
tected from unfair, abusive practices.
To give an example, I was particu-
larly concerned about his hostility to
data. Decisions should be based on
data. Under Director Cordray, the Bu-
reau published a report on the effects
of the Credit CARD Act, which I au-
thored. They would publish it every 2
years.
Mr. Chairman, this is an incredibly
important bill, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mr. Chairman, I include in the
RECORD an article I wrote for The Hill
about the CARD Act.
[From The Hill, May 22, 2019]
CARD ACT TURNS 10: CHANGES HAVE KEPT
MONEY IN CONSUMERS’ POCKETS
(By Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D–N.Y.))
Ten years ago, on May 22, 2009, credit card
customers got some needed relief when the
Credit Card Accountability Responsibility
and Disclosure (CARD) Act became law.
Since then, the law has saved consumers an
estimated $12 billion a year, which translates
into well over $100 billion in total savings
over the past decade. As The New York
Times reported, the CARD Act proved so ef-
fective that it led economists studying the
law to a single conclusion: ‘‘The regulation
worked.’’
Before the CARD Act, some credit card
companies took advantage of their cus-
tomers by raising interest rates or changing
the terms of their contracts without notice.
Hidden terms and fees were lucrative for
credit card companies but they were ex-
tremely costly to consumers. However, the
new law was revolutionary, establishing
strict rules for how credit card companies
must treat their customers, barring many
unfair practices. On the 10th anniversary of
the CARD Act, it is important to remember
how far we have come and also to look ahead
to changes we still need to make.
So what did the CARD Act do? For start-
ers, it protected consumers from arbitrary
interest-rate increases by prohibiting retro-
active rate hikes. Companies now are re-
quired to provide 45 days’ notice of a rate in-
crease and cannot raise rates on existing bal-
ances. In the past, companies regularly in-
creased your interest rate if your risk profile
worsened—now they are required to decrease
rates if your credit picture brightens. That is
only fair.
But consumers were also getting socked by
a host of fees, so the CARD Act introduced
some commonsense changes that made it
much less likely that consumers would be
hit by these fees. The law requires companies
to mail credit card bills at least 21 days be-
fore the due date; it prohibits companies
from charging extra fees for paying online or
by phone; and it requires companies to apply
payments to balances with the highest inter-
est rate first. All of these changes save con-
sumers money.
The law protects young people from ag-
gressive marketing tactics. Companies no
longer can sell cards to individuals under the
age of 21 without an adult co-signer.
The law also protects consumers when
they cancel their credit card. In the past, a
company could demand immediate payment
of your balance. Now, a customer has five
years to pay off the balance.
These important changes have kept money
in consumers’ pockets. The next battle is to
institute fair, common-sense regulation of
the overdraft fees on bank accounts. Some fi-
nancial institutions use ‘‘overdraft protec-
tion’’ to slap their customers with exorbi-
tant fees. With the growing use of debit
cards, it’s easier than ever to overdraw a
checking account, with fees that can run as
high as a 17,000 percent annual percentage
rate, according to the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau. That’s not a financial
service—it’s a robbery.
That is why, since 2005, I have been intro-
ducing legislation that would ban abusive
overdraft practices like reordering trans-
actions in order to maximize the number of
fees banks can charge, and to require over-
draft fees to be proportional to the size of
the overdraft—no more $35 overdraft fees for
a $2 cup of coffee. My bill would also require
banks to notify consumers that a purchase
or an ATM withdrawal is about to trigger an
overdraft, and provide consumers with a
choice of whether to accept the overdraft
service and fee. That, like the CARD Act,
would prevent millions of Americans from
unwittingly losing money to their banks.
Opponents of the CARD Act said that try-
ing to limit the fees credit card companies
charged would prove unsuccessful and that
companies would just create new fees, But
that has not happened.
So when people tell me that regulation
does not work and is costly, I remind them
that well-crafted consumer protections will
not only work, but can save Americans tens
of billions of dollars. The CARD Act is proof.

Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman,
I yield the balance of my time to the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY), ranking member of the full
committee.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR),
ranking member of the Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations of the
Financial Services Committee.
Mr. BARR. Mr. Chair, I thank Rank-
ing Member MCHENRY for yielding.
Mr. Chair, this legislation, H.R. 1500,
the so-called Consumers First Act, nei-
ther puts consumers first nor puts in
place the reforms that are needed to
make the CFPB a stronger and more
accountable regulatory agency. In re-
ality, this bill is an attempt to politi-
cize consumer protection.
It represents my Democratic col-
leagues’ genuine expression of frustra-
tion with the current CFPB leadership,
but that frustration is misdirected, Mr.
Chair. That frustration really is more
about their inability to provide mean-
ingful oversight over this Bureau, a
Bureau that they themselves created in
the Dodd-Frank law.
I would submit that my Democratic
friends’ frustration should not be di-
rected at former Acting Director Mick
Mulvaney or current Director Kathy
Kraninger. Their frustration is, in fact,
a product of the very structure, the
very flawed structure, that they them-
selves created and now stubbornly de-
fend.
Today’s legislation does absolutely
nothing to address the fundamental
structural flaws of the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau, which
could be remedied on a bipartisan basis
with simple reforms that my Repub-
lican colleagues and I have supported
since the Bureau’s creation.
I think, now that the leadership has
shifted and there is a new administra-
tion with new appointees in the leader-
ship, many of my Democratic friends
are having regrets about the structure
that they originally created.
What would be the reforms that we
should together as a body on a bipar-
tisan basis support? A bipartisan com-
mission; subjecting the Bureau to con-
gressional appropriations with my leg-
islation, the Taking Account of Bu-
reaucrats’ Spending Act, which would
restore the power of the purse over this
agency; an independent inspector gen-
eral, which would hold leadership of ei-
ther party accountable.
Mr. Chair, this is just a messaging
bill. It is not a true attempt to legis-
late. This bill does nothing to get at
the lack of accountability of this Bu-
reau.
To further make this point, my
friend, the chairwoman, talks about
the need to add supervisory authority
to the Bureau over enforcement and

compliance with the Military Lending
Act, but the bill doesn’t do that. I have
a bill that does that. In fact, I offered
the bill as an amendment, but Monday
night, in the Rules Committee, they
made this amendment out of order.
This is not about actually giving the
Bureau supervision over the Military
Lending Act. If they really wanted
that, they would have approved my
amendment. We would be voting on my
amendment to give the Bureau super-
visory authority over enforcement of
the Military Lending Act.
But, no. This is just about making a
political point. Sure, they have find-
ings that there should be supervisory
authority over Military Lending Act
compliance. Well, then why not make
this Republican amendment in order to
make it a bipartisan bill?
They don’t want a bipartisan bill.
They want a political message.
This reaffirms our point that this
legislation is not about consumer pro-
tection. It is not about putting con-
sumers first. It is about politics. It is
about giving lip service to protecting
our servicemembers while excluding
the necessary action to actually do it.
Mr. Chair, I encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote
on this bill. Let’s roll up our sleeves.
Let’s defend this institution. Let’s
work together in a bipartisan way to
truly enact the reforms, the structural
reforms that will strengthen consumer
protection that will make this Bureau
accountable to the American people
through their elected representatives.
Let’s make this a bipartisan commis-
sion. Let’s give this institution, both
Republicans and Democrats, the power
of the purse over this agency so that
when a Director from the Trump ad-
ministration is in place, this body will
have the ability to provide meaningful
oversight, and when there is a Demo-
cratic appointee heading this agency,
this body will also be able to exercise
meaningful oversight.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Let’s
do real reforms. Let’s not just make
political points.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, we have no
regrets about how we organized the
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau, and the supervisory authority is
already in law. All they have to do is
implement it.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY),
the chair of the Subcommittee on
Housing, Community Development and
Insurance on the Financial Services
Committee.
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chairwoman for yielding, and I rise
today to enthusiastically support the
Consumers First Act, a bill that re-
turns the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau to its intended role as a
nonpartisan consumer watchdog that
elevates the interests of American tax-
payers above those of special interests.
The Bureau was created by the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-
sumer Protection Act following the fi-
nancial crisis to ensure that Americans
have a regulator working solely on
their behalf in order to protect them
from predatory and abusive actors.
Under Director Richard Cordray’s lead-
ership, the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau helped over 30 million con-
sumers who were harmed and addressed
over 1.2 million complaints about fi-
nancial institutions.
As the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Housing, Community De-
velopment and Insurance, I am pleased
to see that this critical legislation re-
stores the supervisory and enforcement
powers of the Bureau’s office tasked
with combating discriminatory lending
practices, which have been responsible
for causing the racial wealth gap to
continue to grow, especially after the
financial crisis of 2008.
This is a commonsense bill that,
again, puts the American consumer
first and ensures that, in the regular
course of business and commerce, peo-
ple are not forgotten.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from the
great State of North Carolina (Mr.
BUDD).
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY), the ranking member, for
yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong
opposition to H.R. 1500. It is decep-
tively, and yet cleverly, named the
Consumer First Act.
Let’s talk some facts.
House Financial Services Committee
Republicans have been trying for years
to increase transparency and account-
ability at the CFPB. We have tried to
create an Office of the Inspector Gen-
eral for that purpose. We have also
tried to bring accountability by sub-
jecting the CFPB to the appropriations
process. Yet, despite our attempts, we
have been met with opposition every
single time to what used to be a bipar-
tisan goal.
Now, today, we see a bill that my
friends on the other side of the aisle
are pushing that would undermine our
previous efforts to shine some daylight
on this agency. Rather than working
with us to reform the agency and its
authorities, and rather than working
with us to avoid constant partisan pol-
icy shifts from Director to Director,
rather than working with us in a bipar-
tisan manner, the majority is choosing
to move legislation today that simply
advances their own political agenda.
Mr. Chair, I oppose this bill.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, it is abso-
lutely unbelievable that the Repub-
licans on the opposite side of the aisle
now talk about wanting to work with
us after they have done everything pos-
sible to undermine the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau.
We move ahead with restoring it
from all the harm that has been done
to it.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DAVID
SCOTT), a leading senior member of the
Financial Services Committee.
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr.
Chair, I thank the chairwoman for
yielding.
Mr. Chair, this is singularly the most
significant part of the Dodd-Frank leg-
islation. It is the heart and the soul of
it because it goes to protecting the
American people against the abuses
that have been predicated upon it.
This bill is singularly important. Let
me tell Members some of the things it
does.
Mr. Chair, right now, we have 44 mil-
lion students, 44 million student loan
borrowers, who are suffering, trying to
figure out how to pay back these loans.
There are predatory lenders that are
out to abuse these students.
What does Ms. WATERS’ bill do? It es-
tablishes a dedicated student loan of-
fice within the CFPB to protect the
Nation’s 44 million student loan bor-
rowers. That is what this bill does.
Also, it emphasizes the need for a
transparent and accessible consumer
complaint database. We get it all the
time. Consumers presently make com-
plaints at the way they are handling
the CFPB now under the Trump admin-
istration. No attention is paid to that.
No transparency is there. Ms. WATERS’
effort here will correct that.
Mr. Chair, this financial dynamic
that we have suffered still looms large,
and we need to restore the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau to its
rightful stature as the one premier
agency that does the singular, most
important thing today: protect the fi-
nancial transactions of our American
people.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. JOHN W. ROSE), a new mem-
ber of the Financial Services Com-
mittee.
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1500.
Mr. Chair, my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle would have Mem-
bers believe that the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau’s structure is
settled law. In fact, I am certain they
will continue repeating that view.
However, no matter how many times
they repeat the sentiment, repeating it
will never make it true.
This is not settled law. The American
people deserve to be represented in
government entities on every level, es-
pecially those as integral to their lives
as the CFPB.
I can assure you, the people of the
Sixth District of Tennessee are un-
happy with the structure of the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau
and its utter lack of accountability.
My constituents have expressed the
same frustration time and again. The
level of independence given to the
CFPB is counter to the very freedoms
we expect in this country.
It is our job to ensure that the Amer-
ican people have a voice in the business
of their government. Right now, the
structure of the CFPB does not provide
a voice to the people of Tennessee or to
the people of this country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4079
May 22, 2019
This is unacceptable. It is unaccept-
able to me, and it should be unaccept-
able to each of us in this Chamber.
Over 240 years ago, our forbearers
fought a Revolutionary War, a War of
Independence with a battle cry of, ‘‘No
taxation without representation.’’ Per-
haps that battle cry today should be,
‘‘No regulation without representa-
tion.’’
Do we trust a fully independent bu-
reaucrat with unlimited government
funding to act in the best interests of
honest, hardworking Americans, or do
we trust their elected representatives?
Overwhelmingly, I trust those of us
in this body to oversee the CFPB far
more than we can ever rely on an inde-
pendent bureaucrat to do so. We are
held accountable every 2 years in this
Chamber. If voters do not like the way
we are doing our job, they can send us
home. This matters to the American
people, and it should matter to us.
H.R. 1500 does not address the real
issues here: a lack of accountability,
an abuse of power, and an ever-expand-
ing footprint of the Federal Govern-
ment.
Instead, H.R. 1500 attempts to micro-
manage the Bureau now that my
friends on the other side of the aisle
see what it is like when the shoe is on
the other foot.
The esteemed ranking member from
North Carolina and I urge our fellow
Members to join us in voting against
this legislation, the latest rendition of
irresponsible Big Government.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, this is a
consumer bill. My friends on the oppo-
site side of the aisle who would try to
kill this bill evidently do not under-
stand that the day is over when preda-
tory lending will go forth in this body.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY),
the chair of the Subcommittee on Di-
versity and Inclusion on the Financial
Services Committee.
b 1245
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Chairman, I want
to thank Chairwoman WATERS for her
leadership and commitment to putting
the consumer back in the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau without re-
grets.
Mr. Chair, I am proud to be an origi-
nal sponsor of this bill because it does
exactly what the title of this bill says
it does. It puts consumers first. One, by
restoring supervisory and enforcement
authority to the Office of Fair Lending.
It also establishes the student loan of-
fice—continuing—and resumes mili-
tary lending examinations, all without
regret.
Mr. Chairman, I don’t know what my
colleagues are talking about. Those are
things that we need, and maybe that is
why some of the people did send them
back home. I do agree with my col-
league on that.
This bill ensures that no matter who
is running the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, there are protec-
tions that guard against a rogue Direc-
tor from dismantling it and halting its
important work, as this administration
has attempted to do time and time
again.
Mr. Chairman, I support this because
I support the workers. I support what
they do for consumers. I support this
legislation, and I will proudly debate
anyone who thinks this chairwoman
has not established legislation and
policies that put consumers first.
I urge all of my colleagues, even
those on the other side: Let’s talk
about bipartisanship. Let’s get on
board and vote ‘‘yes’’ for this.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. GARCÍA), a member of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise today in strong support of
the Consumers First Act and thank
Chairwoman WATERS and Speaker
PELOSI for their leadership.
I remember the housing market col-
lapse in 2009 very clearly. I remember
the foreclosure signs going up all over
Chicago and in my own neighborhood
of Little Village, a working-class com-
munity. Families lost homes. They
skipped meals. They took second and
third jobs just to scrape by. Too many
families never recovered.
President Obama and the Democratic
majority swore to never allow a Great
Recession to happen again. Never again
would we allow Wall Street to go un-
checked and allow consumers to be
ripped off wholesale by the big banks.
We passed sweeping legislation,
Dodd-Frank, and we created the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau,
the CFPB. In short, CFPB was going to
be the consumer watchdog for everyday
hardworking Americans.
Since Trump’s election, every day
has been an assault against these pro-
tections: payday lending protections,
reversed; student loan protections, re-
versed; predatory auto and home loan
protections, reversed. Instead of pro-
tecting consumers, Trump and Mick
Mulvaney have made their priorities
clear: banks over people, business over
the consumer.
Systematically, Mulvaney and
Trump have been busy dismantling the
CFPB, the same agency that recently
helped a man in New York who had lost
$1,200 wrongly taken from his account.
He was able to recover it thanks to the
CFPB. That man is one of thousands
that have been helped by the agency.
That is the power of government when
it is empowered to fight for every
American.
Meanwhile, Mulvaney has called the
CFPB’s public complaint database
nothing but a ‘‘yelp for financial serv-
ices.’’
At a time when this administration
is working at the behest of Wall Street,
the 1 percent, and the big banks, this
Democratic majority is moving for-
ward to protect consumers.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I would commend to
the House that, when someone gets
into fundamental issues of a 5-year
term that the only way the Director
can be fired is for cause. The Demo-
crats have created an unaccountable
bureau of government.
Now, I think what we have today is a
bit of buyer’s remorse by my Demo-
cratic colleagues who created the
CFPB in order to be this unaccountable
bureau, but headed by a Democrat or a
Democratic Presidential appointee.
Now that we have a Republican ap-
pointee in the CFPB, they want to re-
order how the Director has her staff re-
port to her.
That is what a big chunk of this bill
does. They want to micromanage the
Bureau because they don’t like what
the current Director is doing.
If we seek to actually have long-term
consumer protection within our finan-
cial regulators, I think we need a bi-
partisan board to oversee an agency
like this. I think it is a fundamentally
different agency when you have a bi-
partisan board and it looks and acts
more like the Securities and Exchange
Commission that has long-term, last-
ing buy-in by both parties and by the
American public for the enforcement
actions that they take and gives inves-
tors confidence in that area.
On this side of the ledger, what we
said on the Republican side during the
Dodd-Frank debate and we have said
consistently since then is, if you want
a lasting Bureau, you need to have a
bipartisan board. And funny enough, I
think that was originally a bipartisan
idea, and it has now become mostly a
Republican idea.
What I would commend is, if we want
to get into issues of reforming the Bu-
reau, we need to get into the structural
reforms about appropriations and a bi-
partisan board and inspector general to
oversee an agency such as this rather
than tinkering around the edges about
reporting structures within the Bureau
or the naming of the Bureau.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE), a member of
the Ways and Means Committee and al-
ways a strong leader on consumer pro-
tection issues.
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I thank
Chairwoman WATERS so much for
yielding to me, and I want to thank
Chairwoman WATERS and my former
colleagues on the House Financial
Services Committee for getting this
important legislation, the Consumers
First Act, to the floor.
The CFPB, as Members have heard,
has been a great equalizer in our finan-
cial markets for regular Americans. It
makes sure that financial institutions
follow the law and that regular people
are treated fairly.
Every business claims that they put
their customers first, but what happens
when they don’t? For far too long, the
answer was nothing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4080 May 22, 2019
We have seen the car loans at higher
interest rates for people of color and
mortgage products that almost
brought our economy down and created
and pushed us into the Great Reces-
sion.
Then along came Dodd-Frank and the
CFPB, which set the table for the eco-
nomic expansion that we have seen
since 2010. The dedicated men and
women of the CFPB have literally put
$12 billion back into the pockets of vic-
tims of fraud, harmful financial
schemes, and other abuses.
Let me say to my colleagues on the
other side: Speaker after speaker has
gotten up and talked about subjecting
the CFPB to the appropriations proc-
ess. They have claimed that they are
against the independence of the agen-
cies, calling them independent bureau-
crats. That is exactly what their com-
ments lean toward is taking away the
independence of this agency to deter-
mine fraud and abuse and subjecting it
to the whims of whoever is the Presi-
dent or whoever is the administration.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this important legislation be-
cause it is good for consumers, good for
businesses, good for our financial mar-
kets, and good for the American peo-
ple.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO), a strong defender
of consumers.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 1500, a bill that
will ensure the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau has the necessary
tools to defend American consumers.
The CFPB was created in the wake of
the financial crisis as consumers fell
victim to unfair, deceptive, and abu-
sive practices.
My Republican colleagues have tried
to undermine it for nearly a decade
since its arrival. The Trump adminis-
tration has worked to kneecap the
CFPB, using a strategy that prioritizes
big businesses over individual con-
sumers. As can be seen, enforcement
has decreased by 75 percent at the
CFPB.
H.R. 1500 will fortify the CFPB’s core
mission to protect consumers and rem-
edy the Trump administration’s harm-
ful anticonsumer tactics.
My home district lies in California’s
Inland Empire, and the constituents I
serve understand the importance of
CFPB’s mission all too well. At the
height of the housing crisis, one in five
local households were behind on their
mortgages. In 2008 alone, over 30,000
families from Riverside County lost
their homes to foreclosure.
This was, however, by Wall Street’s
design. In no other area of the country
did subprime loans aggressively pushed
by lenders claim a bigger proportion of
the overall mortgage market. This bill
ensures the CFPB is equipped and em-
powered to fight this type of predatory
lending and much more.
Simply put, the Consumers First Act
ensures that CFPB maintains the au-
thority and resources to do its job and
proactively protect consumers from
unfair, misleading, and abusive prac-
tices.
Let’s pass this bill to make crystal
clear that the CFPB truly does have
the back of every single American con-
sumer. I strongly urge my colleagues
to vote in favor of H.R. 1500.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. DOGGETT), a senior member of the
Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the chairwoman for her leader-
ship because today’s bill is about re-
storing effective law enforcement for
consumers and protecting them from
predatory Wall Street practices.
Republicans want to shield Wall
Street, granting it free rein to plunder.
Instead of draining the swamp, this
lawless President has drained the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau of
its strength. Public enforcement ac-
tions are down 75 percent. That is how
they feel about law enforcement.
The President is refusing to protect
our active-duty military from preda-
tory lending; halting payments to con-
sumers who have been wronged; elimi-
nating the office that is designed to
prevent discrimination in credit
against Latinos, African Americans,
and Asian Americans; and eliminating
the office dedicated to addressing stu-
dent loan abuses.
Enough is enough. Instead of
handcuffing those who do wrong, this
administration is handcuffing the
agency designed to ensure law enforce-
ment.
And while this President profited
himself from scams like Trump Univer-
sity, it is time to restore important
consumer protections: law enforcement
to protect students, active military,
and the retirement savings of our sen-
iors.
In just five years, $12 billion was re-
turned to over 30 million American
citizens. Wells Fargo would never have
been penalized a penny for its multi-
million-dollar fraud without a cop on
the beat.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Mulvaney have
been about pulling that cop back so
that there is no protection for those
this agency was designed to serve.
Let’s approve this bill to protect Amer-
icans from financial piranhas who
would strip their savings to the bone.
Mr. Chair, I salute the leadership of
the chairwoman of the Financial Serv-
ices Committee, for standing up for
Americans who have been abandoned
by this administration. It is essential
we do our work in Congress to say it is
consumers who come first, not those
who would prefer to take advantage of
them.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. NORTON).
Members are reminded to refrain from
engaging in personalities toward the
President.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I would
like to inquire as to how much time is
remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from California has 9 minutes remain-
ing. The gentleman from North Caro-
lina has 17 minutes remaining.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I am
prepared to close, so I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
b 1300
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I am so proud of this
legislation, I am so proud of the mem-
bers of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, and I am so proud of our Demo-
cratic Caucus. We have strong support
for this legislation. I am so proud of
the over 50 consumer, labor, and civil
rights organizations who strongly sup-
port H.R. 1500, the Consumers First
Act.
It has been said more than once
today that we went through a recession
here in this country—almost a depres-
sion—in 2008 when predatory lending
from the major financial institutions
in America caused this recession and
caused us to have communities that
were devastated—boarded up homes—
we had communities, not only where
the homes were boarded up, but the
weeds were growing up, in many in-
stances animals had taken over the
property, and many consumers and
homeowners who lost these homes real-
ly did not know what had happened to
them.
It was predatory lending. It was the
tricks that were fostered on innocent
people who simply wanted to live the
American Dream and own a home.
They signed on the dotted line for
products and mortgages they didn’t un-
derstand and could not afford. And
they were led into signing on the bot-
tom line because we had predatory
lenders who wanted to get them into a
situation where they could get some
money, perhaps up front, and sell off
the products that they were getting
signed on up to Wall Street, et cetera,
et cetera.
Of course, we worked for 2 years, and
it was in 2010 that we were able to put
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau together, which is indeed the cen-
terpiece of the Dodd-Frank reforms. So
we had Mr. Cordray who was our first
Director who did a magnificent job,
and it has been cited here time and
time again.
My friends on the opposite side of the
aisle have done everything that they
could do to dismantle the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau, and,
Madam Chair, none of them are going
to vote for this bill today. None of
them will criticize the big banks on
Wall Street and others who took ad-
vantage of our consumers.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I in-
quire from Chairwoman WATERS if she
is prepared to close.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4081
May 22, 2019
Ms. WATERS. No, I am not prepared
to close.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GREEN), who is the chair of the
Subcommittee on Oversight and Inves-
tigations on the Financial Services
Committee.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I
thank the chair of the full committee.
I am honored to have this opportunity
to speak in support of this bill.
This bill addresses a concern that
many of us on the Financial Services
Committee have had to deal with for
some time now, and it is the question
of whether the committee is going to
allow the CFPB to protect consumers
from unscrupulous behavior or to pro-
tect Big Business. I am a person who
believes that we should protect the
consumer.
This legislation will allow the per-
sons who receive student loans to avoid
being placed into costly repayment
plans that will cause them to pay more
money and possibly default. It will
cause consumers looking to open a new
checking account to have the oppor-
tunity to do so with a bank that has
the least amount of overdraft fees. It
will allow persons who are seeking
credit cards to have the right to seek
relief through the courts, not through
some boilerplate language that they
might find in a contract that will not
benefit them.
This is the opportunity that we must
take advantage of to protect con-
sumers. It is the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, not the financial
institutions protection bureau.
So with this said, I wholeheartedly
endorse what the chairperson has
brought to the attention of this Con-
gress. These are remedies that are ab-
solutely necessary, and I plan to vote
and encourage my colleagues to vote in
support of this legislation.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairwoman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to just say that we send a mes-
sage from this House today, and our
message that we are sending out across
this Nation is that we are now in a po-
sition to undo what has been done and
the wreckage that has been caused
with our Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau.
We send a message that the day for
predatory lending is over.
We send the message despite the fact
that we have Members of this House
who would dare not stand up for stu-
dents and servicemembers and not
criticize what has happened to con-
sumers in the way that it has happened
in this country. And so I want that
message to be loud and clear.
I want those on Wall Street and the
major banks who had the predatory
products and who had the exotic loans,
I want all those who mismanaged the
way that they deal with our students
when our students had complaints and
they looked for someone to help them,
I want all of them to know, well, I sup-
pose, there is a new sheriff in town.
We are going to make sure that the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
is strong, that it is not simply made up
of political appointees, and that they
do not have to worry in the way that
they are worrying now. We have per-
sonnel who have quit the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau because it
was not carrying out the mission that
was intended.
Again, I have said earlier how proud
I am to have this bill on the floor and
to have the support of the Democratic
Caucus.
I would just ask my friends on the
opposite side of the aisle to think
about what is going on and to think
about ways that they can begin to take
into consideration their constituents
who need protection, and prior to our
legislation there was no protection for
consumers.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
What I would say, Madam Chair, is
that this bill does nothing to protect
consumers. This is all about the report-
ing structure, the organization chart
within the CFPB. In fact, in 21 pages of
findings in this bill, the next 21 pages
of legislative text does nothing to an-
swer the fundamental questions raised
in the first 21 pages.
Moreover, the reforms that are nec-
essary weren’t even considered by the
Democrat majority. So we want to pro-
tect consumers. I think we all want to
protect consumers. Where there is mal-
feasance and where there is wrong-
doing, we will seek it out and we will
have bipartisan cooperation for that
proper oversight by this branch of gov-
ernment.
One area where we can have bipar-
tisan work is the Military Lending Act.
We want to make sure that those who
are serving in the Armed Forces are
protected by those who seek to do fi-
nancial wrongdoing and perpetrate fi-
nancial wrongdoing. This is an area
where Congressman ANDY BARR of Ken-
tucky has authored a bill. He offered it
as an amendment—and it was rejected
by the Rules Committee—that would
have made this otherwise subpar bill
much better in effect, and it would
have actually had a positive impact on
the people whom we all seek to protect.
I think it is important that our col-
leagues understand part of the reason
why we should oppose this bill. I am
prepared to close, but I will wait for
the majority to finish with their speak-
ers before I will do so, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
LYNCH).
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Chair, I want to
thank Chairwoman WATERS for her
great work on this bill. She has been a
true champion on behalf of consumers
during her time in Congress.
This chart shows the decrease in en-
forcement actions which have plum-
meted by 75 percent under the Office of
Management and Budget Director
Mulvaney. Bear in mind that corrup-
tion and abuse of consumers has not
gone away. This is a time period when
Wells Fargo—a perfect example—
robbed their customers, opened up fake
accounts to basically take the pro-
ceeds, used their—this is when cus-
tomers went to Wells Fargo, gave them
all their information, Wells Fargo used
their Social Security numbers and data
to open up fake accounts, so they could
charge their own customers—flat-out
theft—and they had to fire 5,300 em-
ployees. That doesn’t happen by acci-
dent. That is a business model that is
built on abusing the consumer.
That is why the CFPB is necessary,
and that is why we need to pass this
bill today. I support the chairwoman’s
efforts in this regard.
A dramatic decline is evident, from
54 cases in the Obama administration
to 11 this year. The sheriff has basi-
cally left the street. There is no more
cop on the beat now with respect to
protecting the consumer.
Madam Chair, I thank the chair-
woman for giving me this time to point
out the need for the Consumers First
Act, a great bill.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, may I
inquire how much time is remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from California has 30 seconds remain-
ing. The gentleman from North Caro-
lina has 151⁄2 minutes remaining.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, let me close by saying
what I said briefly in debate. This bill
is about buyer’s remorse.
I would say to my colleague from
Massachusetts who raised the issue
about Wells Fargo, there was a bipar-
tisan hearing. Chairwoman WATERS
called the hearing. We had bipartisan
questioning of the Wells Fargo CEO.
We have taken bipartisan work on the
oversight of regulators and the regu-
lated when it came to malfeasance by
Wells Fargo and some of the employees
who were within that firm. There was a
bipartisan level of cooperation there.
I would also highlight, to my col-
league from Massachusetts, that it was
not the regulators who found the mal-
feasance of Wells Fargo, it was the
good and wise reporting of the Los An-
geles Times. Through investigative
journalism, they found the malfea-
sance, the bad actors, and the bad poli-
cies within Wells Fargo—not the regu-
lators. That is a failure of the regu-
lators. It is a failure of the CFPB. We
have yet to have a hearing about those
failures.
Let me say from the outset about
this bill; it proves what Republicans
have said since the passage of Dodd-
Frank: the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau is unaccountable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4082 May 22, 2019
We hear my Democrat colleagues
complain about the actions of a legal
overseer of the Bureau, Mick
Mulvaney, and now the complaints
about the Republican-appointed Direc-
tor, Kathy Kraninger. We are here
today because Democrats regret that
during Dodd-Frank they didn’t go far
enough by mandating outcomes by this
Bureau, because they didn’t consider
that a Republican could actually be a
leader of that Bureau and they may
not like the action of that unaccount-
able Director.
They have buyer’s remorse, and, un-
fortunately, they have decided to ad-
vance legislation that does nothing to
create a more responsible CFPB over
the long term. Instead of taking this
opportunity to work together, to bring
transparency and accountability to the
CFPB, the majority is moving a bill
that does little more than advance
their political agenda and micro-
manage the Bureau.
H.R. 1500 codifies and recreates of-
fices inside the CFPB, some of which
are given more authority and some of
which, like the Office of Cost Benefit
Analysis, are given less.
H.R. 1500 actually directs what Bu-
reau staff can refer to the Bureau as in
public. Now, let me explain: if it is
called the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau under this bill, it is okay.
If it is called the CFPB, that is okay.
If it is referred to as the Bureau, a law
has actually been broken under this
bill.
b 1315
That is one of the more substantive
changes in the bill, actually. I don’t
think it is wise legislating by Congress.
That represents the policy side of the
legislation. One look at this bill’s find-
ings is enough to tell Members what
H.R. 1500 is really about.
There are more pages of findings
than there are of actual legislative
text. The issues they raise in the find-
ings sections, however, are not rem-
edied in the legislative text part of the
bill.
In a series of disparaging statements,
former Acting Director Mick
Mulvaney, a former colleague of ours
here in the House and member of the
Financial Services Committee, and Di-
rector Kathy Kraninger are vilified as
irresponsible zealots.
Specifically, the text describes
former Acting Director Mulvaney as
‘‘anticonsumer,’’ ‘‘destructive,’’ and
‘‘inane,’’ only working ‘‘to hamstring
the good work, passion, and the capac-
ity of dedicated staff.’’
The findings also opine that ‘‘the ap-
pointment of Mr. Mulvaney aimed to
diminish and undermine the mission of
the Consumer Bureau.’’
This is a highly suspect section of
legislation before this House. I don’t
think it is becoming of this House to
opine in this way.
While Mick Mulvaney may be many
things, he is not inane nor is he
anticonsumer. Now, I may say, jok-
ingly, that I find him destructive, prob-
ably destructive with his humor, but
not destructive in the work that he
achieves in public policy. I think he is
a good public servant, serving our
country admirably; and, with the work
that he did at the Bureau, he was try-
ing to achieve the best results possible
for consumers, for institutions, for fi-
nancial safety and soundness, and for
the economy at large. He did good
work.
With that context in mind, we know
that this bill is not about helping con-
sumers. This bill is about constraining
Republican Directors from making de-
cisions they believe are in the best in-
terest of the agency.
In the Financial Services Committee
markup, Republicans offered amend-
ments that would have made respon-
sible changes to the Bureau. Had those
amendments been adopted, the major-
ity would have a much better bill.
An inspector general would have pro-
vided oversight of the Director, ensur-
ing the mission of the agency is not un-
dermined. That is important for all
branches of government.
Subjecting the Bureau to annual ap-
propriations would have also ensured
congressional oversight of the CFPB,
or the Bureau, and a voice in the
prioritization of Bureau functions.
A GAO study examining the efficacy
in which the Bureau meets its statu-
tory obligations would have actually
yielded insight into the workings of
the otherwise opaque Bureau.
But those amendments were not
adopted. The choice was made to move
forward with a partisan declaration in-
stead of meaningful bipartisan legisla-
tion. That is unfortunate.
Thankfully, there will be a Senate,
and the Senate has a different view on
this. It is my hope that this bill does
not become law.
Unfortunately, we can’t improve this
legislation through a meaningful
amendment process because of the na-
ture of the rule passed by the Rules
Committee.
We are merely adding more political
fodder for press releases as a result of
this bill. H.R. 1500 will pass the House
and will go nowhere in the Senate.
The Financial Services Committee
will then turn to the next issue. Hope-
fully, it is bipartisan legislating, where
Chairwoman WATERS and I have had
success in the past, and I hope we have
success in the future.
But, to the American people, I say
that the Financial Services Committee
Republicans remain committed to
bettering this organization of the
CFPB. We will protect consumers,
while maximizing financial choice. We
will work to advance solutions, not
sound bites. It is my sincere hope that
we can do that with cooperation from
the majority.
I ask my colleagues to join me in op-
posing H.R. 1500, legislation that puts
politics first, not consumers.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I am so
proud that, today, we are going to
stand up for consumers on this side of
the aisle. It is unfortunate that our
friends on the opposite side of the aisle
have not seen fit to support consumers.
They will all vote against this bill. We
will vote for this bill on this side of the
aisle.
Madam Chair, again, I urge my col-
leagues to come to the floor quickly
and vote for consumer financial protec-
tion, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-
eral debate has expired.
In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by
the Committee on Financial Services,
printed in the bill, an amendment in
the nature of a substitute consisting of

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111–203)
(‘‘Dodd-Frank’’), was signed into law on July
21, 2010, in order to, among other things, ad-
vance the goals of protecting consumers from
predatory financial services practices and prod-
ucts that led to the 2007–2009 financial crisis.
(2) Title X of Dodd-Frank established a new
Federal independent watchdog, known as the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (‘‘Con-
sumer Bureau’’), with broad authority to ensure
that all hardworking consumers are given clear,
accurate information that they need to shop for
mortgages, credit cards, and other consumer fi-
nancial products or services and to protect con-
sumers from hidden fees, abusive terms, and
other unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or prac-
tices through strong implementation and en-
forcement of Federal consumer financial laws.
(3) Before the Consumer Bureau was estab-
lished, Federal financial regulators were tasked
with the dual responsibilities of supervising in-
stitutions for safety and soundness and compli-
ance with consumer protections under Federal
consumer financial laws. These agencies often
prioritized the profitability of their regulated
entities over the protection of consumers, even
when institutions were found to have engaged
in practices detrimental to their own customers’
financial well-being.
(4) Congress purposefully created the inde-
pendent Consumer Bureau within the Federal

Reserve System to address past regulatory gaps
in our country’s financial regulatory regime—
gaps that resulted in the most severe global fi-
nancial crisis since the Great Depression.
Among other things, Federal financial regu-
lators were too reluctant to exercise their rule-
making, supervisory, and enforcement authori-
ties to protect consumers from the misdeeds of
the Consumer Bureau’s regulated entities. In
creating the Consumer Bureau, Congress explic-
itly laid out in statute the Consumer Bureau’s
purpose, five objectives, and six primary func-
tions. Specifically:
(A) Section 1021(a) of Dodd-Frank states that
the Consumer Bureau, ‘‘shall seek to implement
and, where applicable, enforce Federal con-
sumer financial law consistently for the purpose
of ensuring that all consumers have access to
markets for consumer financial products and
services and that markets for consumer finan-
cial products and services are fair, transparent,
and competitive’’.
(B) Section 1021(b) of Dodd-Frank authorizes
the Consumer Bureau, ‘‘to exercise its authori-
ties under Federal consumer financial law for
the purposes of ensuring that, with respect to
consumer financial products and services—(1)
consumers are provided with timely and under-
standable information to make responsible deci-
sions about financial transactions; (2) con-
sumers are protected from unfair, deceptive, or
abusive acts and practices and from discrimina-
tion; (3) outdated, unnecessary, or unduly bur-
densome regulations are regularly identified and
addressed in order to reduce unwarranted regu-
latory burdens; (4) Federal consumer financial
law is enforced consistently, without regard to
the status of a person as a depository institu-
tion, in order to promote fair competition; and
(5) markets for consumer financial products and
services operate transparently and efficiently to
facilitate access and innovation.’’.
(C) Section 1021(c) of Dodd-Frank establishes
the primary functions of the Consumer Bureau
to be, ‘‘(1) conducting financial education pro-
grams; (2) collecting, investigating, and re-
sponding to consumer complaints; (3) collecting,
researching, monitoring, and publishing infor-
mation relevant to the functioning of markets
for consumer financial products and services to
identify risks to consumers and the proper func-
tioning of such markets; (4) subject to sections
1024 through 1026, supervising covered persons
for compliance with Federal consumer financial
law, and taking appropriate enforcement action
to address violations of Federal consumer finan-
cial law; (5) issuing rules, orders, and guidance
implementing Federal consumer financial law;
and (6) performing such support activities as
may be necessary or useful to facilitate the
other functions of the Bureau.’’.
(5) In doing so, Congress explicitly laid out
these consumer-focused purpose, objectives, and
primary functions for the Consumer Bureau to
ensure that all consumers and all communities
are protected. This is of extreme importance to
communities of color who have been dispropor-
tionately impacted by the inequities of the fi-
nancial system, resulting in an extreme racial
wealth divide. Decades of segregation and dis-
crimination have prevented consumers of colors
from amassing wealth equal to their white coun-
terparts, while predatory financial practices of
have stripped consumers of color of their nomi-
nal existing wealth. For example, over the past
30 years, the average wealth of White families
has grown by 84 percent—1.2 times the rate of
growth for the Latino population and three
times the rate of growth for the Black popu-
lation. In light of historical practices and cur-
rent-day disparities in banking and lending
practices, the Consumer Bureau plays a key role
in protecting communities of color from wealth-
stripping financial products and ensuring their
right to wealth building opportunities. The
agency’s enforcement actions in auto lending,
mortgages, and credit cards, and its rulemaking
efforts have sought to address the predatory fi-
nancial products such as payday loans and pre-
paid cards that are prolific in communities of
color. The Consumer Bureau is essential in pro-
tecting vulnerable communities from discrimina-
tory financial practices that has both perpet-
uated and exacerbated the racial wealth gap.
(6) Under Dodd-Frank, the Deputy Director of
the Consumer Bureau shall serve as the Acting
Director in the absence or unavailability of the
Director, until the President appoints and the
Senate confirms a new Director. Despite the
plain letter of the law establishing a succession
order to fill a vacancy in the Director’s position
and the clear legislative history underscoring
the importance of having an independent Fed-
eral consumer-focused agency, when the Con-
sumer Bureau Director Richard Cordray re-
signed in November 2017, President Trump re-
fused to recognize the Deputy Director as the
rightful head of the agency and instead in-
stalled Mr. Mick Mulvaney, the Director of the
White House Office of Management and Budget,
to serve as the Consumer Bureau’s Acting Direc-
tor. This appointment of a White House cabinet
official to run the Consumer Bureau raises pro-
found conflict of interest questions and under-
mines the vital independent nature of the agen-
cy.
(7) Additionally, the position of Acting Direc-
tor is, by its nature, intended to be a temporary
assignment to maintain the status quo at an
agency and to ensure the agency is fulfilling its
statutory purpose and mandates, until the
President appoints, and the Senate confirms a
permanent Director. Nevertheless, during his
tenure, Mr. Mulvaney instituted drastic and se-
vere changes to the Consumer Bureau’s daily
operations and priorities contrary to the agen-
cy’s statutory purpose and mandates.
(8) The daily operations of a Federal agency
are guided by its official mission contained in its
long-term strategic plan. The Consumer Bu-
reau’s mission should embrace both the spirit
and plain letter of the law by fully recognizing
the agency’s statutory purpose, objectives, and
functions. It is troubling that the Consumer Bu-
reau, under Mr. Mulvaney, issued a Strategic
Plan for Fiscal Year (‘‘FY’’) 2018–FY 2022 that
appears to deemphasize the Consumer Bureau’s
core mandate under section 1021(a) of Dodd-
Frank to, ‘‘enforce Federal consumer financial
law consistently for the purpose of ensuring
that all consumers have access to markets for
consumer financial products and services’’, by
not referencing the importance of enforcement
in its mission. Instead, it emphasizes financial
education by stating that the agency’s new mis-
sion is, ‘‘[t]o regulate the offering and provision
of consumer financial products or services under
the Federal consumer financial laws and to edu-
cate and empower consumers to make better in-
formed financial decisions’’. This is in stark
contrast from the Consumer Bureau’s Strategic
Plan for FY 2013–FY 2017, which stated that the
agency’s mission is helping, ‘‘consumer finance
markets work by making rules more effective, by
consistently and fairly enforcing those rules,
and by empowering consumers to take more con-
trol over their economic lives’’ (emphasis added).
(9) Mr. Mulvaney has been praised by the
White House for his efforts to undermine the
Consumer Bureau, with one anonymous advisor
acknowledging in a July 24, 2018, Politico article
that, ‘‘His mission was to blow that up, which
he has. He is very well-suited to the chaos.’’.
Mr. Mulvaney’s misguided actions have in-
cluded, among other things—
(A) stopping payments from the Civil Penalty
Fund to harmed consumers;
(B) trying to reduce the Consumer Bureau’s
funding and staffing by initially requesting $0
be transferred from the Federal Reserve Board
of Governors to carry out the agency’s work, im-
posing a freeze on hiring professional career
staff, and by arbitrarily directing staff to cut
the agency’s budget by 1⁄5;
(C) politicizing the work of the Consumer Bu-
reau by making unusual efforts to fill the inde-
pendent agency with political appointees;
(D) reducing the Consumer Bureau’s enforce-
ment work, including taking only six enforce-
ment actions in the first three quarters of 2018
(compared with 54 enforcement actions taken by
the agency in 2015, 42 enforcement actions in
2016 and 36 enforcement actions in 2017), and
dropping existing lawsuits and investigations
into predatory payday lenders;
(E) taking steps that would undermine efforts
to promote fair lending and combat discrimina-
tory practices, including by hiring, and later re-
fusing to remove, a political appointee with a
history of racist written commentary to oversee
the Office of Supervision, Enforcement, and
Fair Lending, stripping away the enforcement
powers of the Office of Fair Lending and Equal
Opportunity, seeking to curb the Consumer Bu-
reau’s data collection under the Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act, and indicating the Consumer
Bureau would reconsider its approach toward
enforcing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act;
(F) changing the role of the Office of Students
and Young Consumers and, according to an Au-
gust 27, 2018, resignation letter from Seth
Frotman, the Consumer Bureau’s former Assist-
ant Director and Student Loan Ombudsman,
‘‘when new evidence came to light showing that
the nation’s largest banks were ripping off stu-
dents on campuses across the country by sad-
dling them with legally dubious account fees,
Bureau leadership suppressed the publication of
a report prepared by Bureau staff’’;
(G) abandoning the accepted and efficient
practice of having its examiners review, as part
of their routine examinations, creditors’ compli-
ance with the Military Lending Act in order to
ensure the detection and assessment of risky ac-
tivities that could jeopardize vital protections
provided to active-duty servicemembers and
their families;
(H) creating an Office of Cost Benefit Anal-
ysis that prioritizes businesses’ expenses over
harm caused to consumers, and unduly con-
strains oversight of the Consumer Bureau’s reg-
ulated entities;
(I) freezing data collection to the detriment of
supervision and enforcement;
(J) seeking to block the publication of the na-
ture of consumers’ complaints and how entities
resolved them in the publicly available and
transparent Consumer Complaint Database;
(K) restricting key input and feedback from a
wide range of external stakeholders by effec-
tively terminating members’ positions on three
advisory boards, including the statutorily man-
dated Consumer Advisory Board;
(L) proposing policies, including those regard-
ing no-action letters, model disclosure pilot
projects, and product sandboxes, that could put
many kinds of financial institutions in an en-
forcement-free zone, letting bad actors that
harm consumers off the hook entirely from en-
forcement, and allowing them to ignore the law;
and
(M) neglecting to impose promptly any civil
money penalty on a bank when it was found to
be, among other things, improperly obtaining
consumer reports and furnishing to consumer
reporting agencies inaccurate information about
consumers’ credit.
(10) The repeated efforts under Mr.
Mulvaney’s leadership to hamstring the good
work, passion, commitment, and the capacity of
dedicated professional, career Consumer Bureau
staff to fulfill the agency’s statutory mission has
likely contributed to low employee morale. Ac-
cording to a government-wide annual survey
published in December 2018 that was conducted
by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for
Public Service, the Consumer Bureau experi-
enced the largest decline in employee morale for
a government agency of its size. A workplace
with low morale undermines, among other
things, the agency’s ability to hold bad actors
accountable when they harm consumers, and if

unaddressed, will distort the functioning of fair
and competitive consumer marketplaces.
(11) Despite the fact that the agency has been
referred to as the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau since it was created in 2010, Mr.
Mulvaney opted to change the agency’s well-
known name. Although this decision is sup-
posedly intended to ensure that the agency is in
compliance with Dodd-Frank, when this change
is viewed in conjunction with the other detri-
mental actions to undermine the effectiveness of
the agency, it can only be interpreted as an at-
tempt to reduce the public’s awareness of, and
significant support for, the agency’s role as the
top Federal consumer cop as well as to obscure
the public’s ability to easily identify the appro-
priate Federal agency to contact when faced
with predatory behavior by financial actors. As
such, while some may view this particular deci-
sion as minor, the action served as an important
symbolic and literal maneuver by the Trump Ad-
ministration, through its appointment of Mr.
Mulvaney, to diminish and undermine the con-
sumer-focused mission of the Consumer Bureau.
Director Kathy Kraninger, who was duly nomi-
nated by the President and confirmed by the
Senate, announced plans in an email to staff on
December 19, 2018, to reverse course and return
to utilizing the agency’s well-known name.
However, questions remain regarding how this
change will be implemented and to what extent
the agency may continue to utilize Mr.
Mulvaney’s preferred name in certain cir-
cumstances.
(12) During Mr. Mulvaney’s more than 12-
month tenure running the agency, he only ap-
peared once before the House Financial Services
Committee to discuss his activities at the Con-
sumer Bureau. This is despite the fact that the
law requires, at a minimum, the Director’s testi-
mony before the Committee semi-annually. This
weak congressional oversight under the direc-
tion of the previous Republican Majority pales
in comparison to their oversight of the Con-
sumer Bureau during former Director Richard
Cordray’s tenure. During Director Cordray’s
tenure, he and other senior Consumer Bureau
officials testified before Congress more than 60
times; the agency was compelled to produce
more than 200,000 pages of documents in re-
sponse to over 90 letters of inquiry; more than 20
subpoenas were sent to the Consumer Bureau;
and several of the Consumer Bureau’s former
and current employees were compelled to sit for
depositions over 21 days, that lasted 136 hours,
and produced 3,194 pages of transcripts.
(13) Dodd-Frank gives the Director of the
Consumer Bureau broad administrative and ex-
ecutive powers to, among other things: fix the
number of, and appoint and direct, all employ-
ees of the agency; direct the establishment and
maintenance of divisions or other offices within
the agency; determine the character of, and the
necessity for, the obligations and expenditure of
funds; and the use and expenditure of funds.
These powers, however, are required to be exer-
cised in a manner consistent with carrying out
the responsibilities under Title X of Dodd-
Frank, which includes complying with the enu-
merated Federal consumer financial laws under
the Title, and satisfying the obligations in other
applicable laws. Mr. Mulvaney’s destructive ac-
tions have demonstrated the need for legislation
to reorient the Director’s discretionary authority
to ensure the maintenance of all statutorily
mandated policies, functions, and offices of the
Consumer Bureau regardless of who is leading
the agency.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—The following is the
sense of Congress:
(1) The Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau should meet its statutory purpose in a
transparent and accountable manner by oper-
ating in a way that is consistent with both the
spirit and plain letter of the law. This includes
the agency fully carrying out the agency’s stat-
utory purpose, objectives, and functions, and
the agency being transparent, timely, and re-
sponsive to all requests from Congress.
(2) Dodd-Frank underscores that the agency
is designed to serve as an independent Federal
agency that is primarily focused on the protec-
tion of all consumers, without any undue influ-
ence of partisan whims and special industry in-
terests, in carrying out its responsibilities and
duties.
(3) The official name of the agency should be
consistent with this mandate, and the agency
should, figuratively and literally, put ‘‘Con-
sumers’’ first by using its better-known name as
the ‘‘Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’’.
Thus, any remaining utilization by the agency
of the name, ‘‘Bureau of Consumer Financial
Protection’’, or the acronym ‘‘BCFP’’, should
cease in all forms.
(4) The statute establishing the Consumer Bu-
reau has been grossly misinterpreted under Mr.
Mulvaney’s leadership, in a manner that is in-
consistent with the agency’s statutory purpose,
objectives, and functions. One example of this
was Mr. Mulvaney’s inane suggestion that the
statutory requirement for the Director to appear
before relevant Congressional Committees to dis-
cuss its semi-annual reports could be interpreted
as requiring the Director merely to attend a
hearing and not answer questions, despite the
well-established interpretation of a similar stat-
utory requirement for the Chair of the Federal
Reserve Board of Governors to appear before the
House Financial Services Committee and the
Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
Committee on a semi-annual basis about the
monetary policy report, as required by the Hum-
phrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act. In the
face of such blatant and disrespectful attempts
to warp the authorizing and oversight role of
the first branch of the Federal Government—the
United States Congress—by the Trump Adminis-
tration, Congress must, in this instance, now re-
fine the Consumer Bureau’s authority to ensure
that the vital role that the Consumer Bureau
should be playing within the country’s financial
regulatory regime is not effectively destroyed by
the agency’s current leadership.
(5) The Consumer Bureau, now under a new
Director, should promptly reverse all anti-con-
sumer actions taken during Mr. Mulvaney’s ten-
ure, including the actions identified by this leg-
islation, to ensure that the agency is fully com-
plying with its statutory purpose, objectives,
and functions to protect all consumers, includ-
ing communities of color and vulnerable popu-
lations. One important action is for the Con-
sumer Bureau to resume robust fair lending en-
forcement to ensure that every consumer has
fair and equal access to affordable financial
products and services. Another demonstration of
this would be for the Consumer Bureau to imme-
diately resume supervision of its regulated enti-
ties for compliance with the Military Lending
Act to ensure for the most robust and efficient
protection of active-duty servicemembers and
their families. Other examples include the Con-
sumer Bureau significantly revising its strategic
plan to align it with its statutory purpose, ob-
jectives and functions, and for the agency to im-
mediately resume coordinating closely with
other Federal agencies, such as the Department
of Education and the Department of Defense,
and State regulators, as is required by section
1015 of Dodd-Frank to, ‘‘promote consistent reg-
ulatory treatment of consumer financial and in-
vestment products and services.’’
(6) While the legislation is a direct response to
address many of the misguided decisions that
have been orchestrated under Mr. Mulvaney’s
leadership at the Consumer Bureau that have
been exposed to the public, as of the date of the
bill’s introduction, and sharply criticized by nu-
merous Federal and State officials, including
law enforcement, as well as organizations rep-
resenting servicemembers, senior citizens, and
other vulnerable consumer populations, this leg-
islation should not be viewed as an exhaustive
list to fix all the damaging actions that may
have occurred at this agency since the depar-
ture of former Director Cordray in November
2017, particularly since detailed information re-
vealing the full scope, nature, and extent of the
current flawed operation of the agency, and the
adverse impact resulting from these actions, may
not yet be publicly available. Rather, this legis-
lation should be interpreted as an attempt to
highlight and resolve a small sample of the pub-
licly known egregious statements, decisions, and
actions that have occurred since November 2017.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4087
May 22, 2019
More than four decades after Con-
gress passed HMDA, the evidence con-
tinues to suggest that racial minori-
ties, women, and some rural residents
still face loan discrimination by mort-
gage lenders.
In fact, a recent report from the Cen-
ter for Investigative Reporting found
that modern-day redlining has oc-
curred in 61 metropolitan areas around
the country.
Unfortunately, however, last year
Congress voted to roll back enhanced
HMDA protections passed under the
Dodd-Frank Act, exempting 85 percent
of all banks and credit unions from re-
porting loan characteristics vital to
ensuring lending fairness.
My amendment will reverse this
shortsighted decision. It reinstates the
requirement put in place by Dodd-
Frank that any bank or credit union
that makes more than 25 mortgage
loans per year or 100 home equity lines
of credit report detailed loan charac-
teristics.
My amendment will establish addi-
tional safeguards to defend HMDA from
further assault by the Trump adminis-
tration and those who seek to destroy
it by:
Prohibiting the CFPB from making
further HMDA modifications to exempt
additional institutions from complying
with its reporting requirements;
Barring the CFPB from making fur-
ther modifications to eliminate HMDA
data fields that are otherwise required
to be collected and reported; and
Preventing the CFPB from retiring
its HMDA Explorer and the public data
platform, both of which are critical to
the public’s ability to access loan level
data and root out discrimination in
their communities.
These protections are not just pre-
ventive measures but needed reforms.
Just this month, the CFPB released
proposals to further erode HMDA re-
quirements.
The public’s access to mortgage data
is essential to promoting fair lending,
homeownership, and stronger commu-
nities.
As the saying goes, sunlight is the
best disinfectant. My amendment
brings badly needed transparency to
the home mortgage process, shining a
light and helping us root out discrimi-
nation.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. FLETCHER).
The gentleman from North Carolina is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, this
bill, this amendment, reinstates an
older form of regulation of HMDA data.
This is the data that is collected when
you have a home mortgage. It is re-
quired data.
Under the old regulation, there were
48 pieces of data that had to be col-
lected. Under the new regulation, it is
23. That is a modest change that was
agreed upon by a bipartisan vote of
this House and the Senate and signed
into law last Congress under S. 2155. A
changed regulatory structure, still col-
lecting the data.
The most important thing this bill
does, however, is it subjects small cred-
it unions and small banks to a higher
level of regulation than contemplated
under the new regulations and the new
law.
We are rolling back to an older form,
whereby community institutions,
small banks, and small credit unions
have been disproportionately disadvan-
taged in the mortgage marketplace.
They have been given a higher regu-
latory burden, a higher cost structure,
which means that they are out of the
home mortgage game.
The net effect of this amendment is
that you will have small credit unions
and small banks not being able to par-
ticipate as fully as under existing regu-
lations in home mortgage making, and
I think that is one of the deep flaws of
this amendment.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Madam Chair, may
I inquire how much time I have re-
maining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York has 2 minutes remain-
ing.
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Madam Chair, I
am ready to close.
Madam Chair, more than 40 years
after Congress first passed HMDA, the
evidence continues to demonstrate
that countless Americans still face
loan discrimination by mortgage lend-
ers.
Data is the tool that makes it pos-
sible to fight discrimination. My
amendment puts us back on the right
track by ensuring this information re-
mains available.
Madam Chair, I urge Members to sup-
port this amendment, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on
this amendment. This rolls back to an
older form of regulation, not a new,
modern form of regulation.
We still collect very important data
from mortgage makers, those that are
actually in the mortgage marketplace.
What we did was right-size our regula-
tion so that small financial institu-
tions like community banks and credit
unions could be in the mortgage mar-
ketplace once again.
This amendment rolls back those re-
forms and hurts small community
banks and hurts small credit unions in
a way that this body, I don’t think,
wants to support.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote against this amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

tlewoman from New York (Ms.
VELÁZQUEZ).

OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRO-
TECTION BUREAU AND ITS EFFEC-
TIVENESS AT MEETING ITS STATU-

(a) STUDY.—The Comptroller General of
the United States shall carry out a study
of—
(1) the effectiveness and efficiency of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in
meeting the Bureau’s statutorily mandated
obligations;
(2) the prevalence of discriminatory prac-

(3) the workplace rights of Bureau staff
since establishment of the Bureau.
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 6 months after

troller General shall issue a report to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the

mittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Af-
fairs of the Senate containing all findings
and determinations made in carrying out the

ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.

b 1330
Mr. STEIL. Madam Chair, the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau has
a duty to the American people.
Congress established the Bureau al-
most a decade ago to protect con-
sumers from abuse and empower people
to make good financial choices, regard-
less of who the President is. That is a
very important responsibility. With
that in mind, Chairwoman WATERS is
right to call attention to the govern-
ance of the CFPB.
CFPB actions and interpretations
can vary significantly from one admin-
istration to another, and because the
CFPB is unaccountable, there isn’t
much Congress can do about it. In fact,
the Bureau was built to be unaccount-
able and unresponsive, and this has
given its Directors free rein to take ac-
tions that many of us do not support.
There are many ideas on both sides of
the aisle on how best to reform the
CFPB, and this is something Congress
should consider soon.
Today, I have an amendment. My
amendment sets aside the politically
charged findings in the bill and takes
us one step closer to transparency and
accountability.
Some of these findings target former
Acting Director Mick Mulvaney by
name. One disparages Mulvaney by ref-
erencing a political article that in-
cludes a critical quote from an anony-
mous source. Another criticizes him for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4088 May 22, 2019
rearranging the initials of the CFPB.
Let me repeat that: Another criticizes
him for rearranging the initials of the
CFPB. Only in Washington.
My amendment strikes all of this
unhelpful rhetoric and replaces it with
a requirement that the Comptroller
General conduct an independent study
focused on three key questions: One, is
the CFPB meeting its obligations effi-
ciently and effectively? Two, how prev-
alent are discriminatory lending prac-
tices? Three, are the workplace rights
of CFPB staff respected?
The Comptroller General’s findings
can then help to inform our continued
efforts to oversee and reform the Bu-
reau to make it work better for all
Americans.
Protecting consumers, examining the
prevalence of discrimination, and pro-
tecting workplace rights should not be
controversial. Ensuring effectiveness
and transparent governance should not
be a source of partisan disagreement.
I understand that the chairwoman is
unhappy with the way the CFPB is gov-
erned. So am I. Anyone who has read
about the past abuses at this unac-
countable agency should have concerns
about the structure that enables this
bad behavior to exist in the first place.
Today’s amendment recognizes that
Congress has a responsibility to ensure
that the Bureau is fulfilling its mis-
sion, and that independent audit, not
political rhetoric, is the best way to
move toward this goal.
The American people deserve an un-
biased look at what the Bureau does
right and what it does wrong so we can
find common ground on the best way to
protect consumers.
I urge my colleagues to support the
amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Chair, I claim the time in oppo-
sition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Chair, this is a terrible amend-
ment, and I want to take my time to
go through it so the American people
can see how terrible this amendment
is.
The gentleman is a fine gentleman
and a good friend, and we work to-
gether. The amendment is what is ter-
rible, not the gentleman. Let me tell
you why.
This amendment would, number one,
do away with the important findings
on the failures of the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau under Mick
Mulvaney that every American should
know about. I am going to take a few
minutes so the American people will
know about them.
The amendment, which also removes
the direction from Congress to the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau to
reverse its recent anticonsumer activi-
ties, was rejected by all Democrats in
our committee markup.
This amendment is trying to hide
from public view how Acting Director
Mulvaney stopped payments from the
Civil Penalty Fund to consumers who
were harmed, tried to reduce the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau’s
funding and staffing, politicized the
work of the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau by making unusual ef-
forts to fill the independent agency
with political appointees, and reduced
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau’s enforcement actions by 75 per-
cent compared to the average annual
number of enforcement actions from
the previous 3 years.
I mean, that is why it is terrible.
That is why it is dangerous. Of par-
ticular concern, this amendment
strikes a direction to the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau to resume
exams for compliance with the Mili-
tary Lending Act, for our veterans, to
ensure that they are not ripped off by
unscrupulous lenders. That practice is
heavy.
We just passed a bill in committee to
deal with mortgages that were churn-
ing, where predatory lenders were
going in and churning, churning over
and over again, making our veterans
pay the same bill over and over again.
That is what your amendment would
take protections from.
In January of this year, the Con-
sumer Office of Servicemember Affairs,
our veterans, reported that service-
member complaints and requests for
assistance have continued to increase
over time. In fact, from 2016 to 2017,
there was a 47 percent increase in com-
plaints received from servicemembers.
Nevertheless, the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau under its cur-
rent director, Ms. Kathy Kraninger, is
ignoring its own legal counsel and re-
fuses to supervise banks for MLA com-
pliance.
During our March 7 hearing on the
Bureau, veteran Jennifer Davis from
the National Military Family Associa-
tion stated: ‘‘We have become alarmed
by the CFPB’s decision to no longer su-
pervise lenders for compliance with the
MLA. Current leadership has expressed
the opinion that the agency does not
explicitly have the authority to do su-
pervisory examinations to ensure MLA
compliance. We disagree.’’
As Ms. Davis noted, Dodd-Frank
grants the Bureau executive and ad-
ministrative authority in implementa-
tion of consumer financial laws
through rules, orders, guidance, inter-
pretations, statements of policy, ex-
aminations, and enforcement actions.
She has been joined by 38 military and
veteran service organizations, a bipar-
tisan coalition of 33 State attorneys
general, as well as retired Army Colo-
nel Paul Cantwell and the former head
of the Office of Servicemember Affairs,
in disagreeing with the Bureau’s deci-
sion.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. STEIL. Madam Chair, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining on
my side.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Wisconsin has 11⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. STEIL. Madam Chair, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY).
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
think the gentleman from Wisconsin
has authored a very good amendment.
It is a constructive amendment in this
legislative process to make a bad bill
less bad.
It strikes the findings sections, not
the legislation contained therein. It is
the egregious findings and the person-

(A) shall remain in effect and may not be
terminated by any party to such memo-
randa; and
(B) may only be amended or revised if the
parties to the memoranda determine that
such amendment or revision would promote
better interagency coordination to the ben-

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentlewoman
from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Chair, before
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau, there was no Federal agency dedi-
cated to protecting consumers from
predatory and abusive practices, so I
am grateful to my chair for bringing
this issue before us.
I am not exactly sure why my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
have been so resistant to protecting
consumers and to restoring the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau to
its original intent.
My amendment would restore the re-
lationship between the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau and the De-
partment of Education. Specifically, it
would reestablish an interagency
agreement concerning the sharing of
student borrower complaints and allow
for cooperation in the supervision and
oversight of student loan servicers.
It is critical that the Department of
Education work with the CFPB on stu-
dent loan oversight. Currently, the De-
partment of Education is refusing to
share information about loan servicers
and student borrower complaints,
which is making it more difficult for
the CFPB to conduct its investigations
into the lenders’ bad behavior and de-
ceptive practices.
In fact, last Thursday, it was re-
ported that the Director of the CFPB,
in response to Senator WARREN’s in-
quiry, stated that Secretary DeVos and
the Department of Education were
blocking efforts to conduct proper
oversight on the student loan industry.
Because of the stance the Depart-
ment of Education has taken, many
student loan servicers and lenders are
not complying with CFPB’s request for
information as well. These companies
that manage student loans are refusing
to share information that the CFPB
needs to perform proper oversight. This
is unacceptable.
The national student loan debt has
reached crisis levels. The American
people are getting crushed by more
than $1.5 trillion in student debt. More-
over, we have seen countless lawsuits
allege that widespread wrongdoing by
student loan companies is costing some
borrowers thousands of dollars.
This critical amendment would put
borrowers back at the center of the Bu-
reau’s consumer protection work.
Our constituents have elected us to
look out for their best interests, to
protect them from harmful policies,
and to provide them recourse when
they get into difficult situations. Dis-
mantling, undermining, and weakening
the CFPB is not in our constituents’
best interests.
I thank Chairwoman WATERS for her
leadership in restoring the CFPB to its
original intent.
Let’s do the right thing for the
American people. I urge my colleagues
to support my amendment to help stu-
dent borrowers and to support H.R.
1500.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
thank my colleague from North Caro-
lina for raising this issue of student
loans. It is a very important issue for a
whole generation of Americans.
But let’s rewind and understand why
we are in the position we are in with
student loans. In 2009 and 2010, there
was a Democratic majority in the
House and the Senate that, in order to
pass ObamaCare, they needed pay-fors
to pass the Affordable Care and Patient
Protection Act, the formal name of
what we commonly call ObamaCare.
b 1345
One of the major pay-fors was the na-
tionalization of student lending. So
now we have a generation of American
students that have a crushing debt bur-
den because of a government program.
Ninety percent of student loans are
done through the Federal Government.
So let’s get to the fundamentals of
this reform, so that consumers can
have choice, students can have choice.
This amendment doesn’t do that.
The memorandum of understanding
between the CFPB and the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education outlines the param-
eters to share student loan informa-
tion. The Department of Education was
clear in its letter terminating the
memorandum of understanding, stat-
ing:
It takes exception to the CFPB uni-
laterally expanding its oversight role
to include the Department’s contracted
Federal student loan servicers. The De-
partment has full oversight responsi-
bility for Federal student loans under
Federal law.
The Department letter also expressed
concern that:
CFPB’s intervention in this area adds
confusion to borrowers who now hear
conflicting guidance related to Title IV
of student loan services for which the
Department is responsible.
So the memorandum of under-
standing was terminated because the
two separate departments, the CFPB
and the Department of Education, were
sending information to students who
were trying to make payments, some
were trying to catch up on payments,
and they are getting two different
pieces of guidance.
So to reinstate this provides more
confusion for the very people that are
being crushed by a generation of debt.
So it is a deeply problematic amend-
ment, not because it has an ill intent.
The very issue that we are trying to
confront here is a very real one to
these students, to their families, and to
the lost prosperity and economic op-
portunities that they are experiencing
because of the structure of this debt
load and because of this Federalized
approach to student lending.
Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to
reject this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Chair, how
much time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from North Carolina has 2 minutes re-
maining.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Chair, I appre-
ciate the comments from my colleague
from North Carolina.
But we want to make sure that pri-
vate loan services who collect pay-
ments, or those who collect payments
from students, are doing their job.
Now, yes, students want choices. I
taught for 40 years on the campus of
Bennett College. I know the difficulty
that students have, and I know that
they leave college with a lot of debt,
but we should not hold them hostage.
They are asking for a choice to resolve
the problems, and they need someone
there who will speak for them.
That is what this bill will do. That is
what was done before, and we need to
restore that kind of confidence back
into these students so that they know
that they can get some help when they
need it.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I am
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Chair, let me
just say this: This is a good amend-
ment. This is a great bill. It is an op-
portunity for us to restore some con-
fidence and integrity into this process.
We should not hold our students hos-
tage and penalize them because of
something that the Congressman said
the government has done.
Madam Chair, we have an oppor-
tunity to fix this, and I would certainly
encourage all of my colleagues to sup-
port this bill.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, let me
state this clearly. Dodd-Frank con-
ferred authority over private student
lending to the CFPB. It did not grant
the CFPB a role in Federal student
lending that is overseen by the Depart-
ment of Education.
So this amendment is a counterpoint
to what is existing law. The memo-
randum of understanding was termi-
nated for good reason.
This amendment is nothing more
than an attempt to undo another Fed-
eral agency’s action without under-
standing the context in which it was
terminated.
I think the fundamental issue here is
consumer choice, student choice. We
lack that currently.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4090 May 22, 2019
When 90 percent of student lending is
run by the Federal Government, we
have a problem. That is a nationalized
set of lending.
With more consumer choice, with
better technology, with real innova-
tion, we can give students better op-
portunities and better choices. Those
things are happening in the private
sector, but in a limited way, because
the Federal Government is so deeply
involved in student lending.
Let’s fix that issue of student lending
with good reforms, with proper innova-
tion, with more choices.
Madam Chair, this amendment does
not achieve those things, sadly, and I
would ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.
ADAMS).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 4 OFFERED BY MR. LAWSON OF
FLORIDA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 4 printed in
part A of House Report 116–79.
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam
Chair, I have an amendment on the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 40, after line 8, insert the following:
SEC. 9. REPORT ON FAIR LENDING INVESTIGA-
TIONS AND ENFORCEMENT AC-
TIONS.
Section 1016 of the Consumer Financial
Protection Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5496) is
amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(d) REPORT ON FAIR LENDING INVESTIGA-
TIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.—The Di-
rector shall issue a monthly report to Con-
gress containing—
‘‘(1) the number of investigations opened
and closed by the Bureau relating to poten-
tial fair lending violations;
‘‘(2) how many fair lending enforcement ac-
tions have been taken or referred;
‘‘(3) an analysis of consumer complaints re-
lating to potential fair lending violations;
and
‘‘(4) statistics on how many staff of the Of-
fice of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity
are dedicated to fair lending supervision and
enforcement issues.’’.
Page 40, line 9, strike ‘‘SEC. 9’’ and insert
‘‘SEC. 10’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. LAWSON) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Florida.
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam
Chair, I rise to support the Consumers
First Act and my amendment that
would provide transparency in the
number of fair lending cases that are
opened and closed by the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau.
This Bureau was created under Dodd-
Frank to provide consumer protection
from unfair lending practices. These
individuals include our Nation’s vet-
erans, students, those who have mort-
gages, and individuals with auto loans,
which is very prevalent.
Since the creation of the CFPB, it
has helped over 31 million harmed con-
sumers with over $12 billion in relief.
That is pretty substantial.
In addition, the CFPB has received
and taken action on nearly 1 million
complaints.
Today, the CFPB’s ability to con-
tinue protecting our Nation’s bor-
rowers has been severely limited by the
Trump administration. The adminis-
tration has weakened the supervision
and enforcement of fair lending,
blocked payday loan cases, dismantled
protections for servicemembers, and
has reduced transparency and account-
ability.
The Consumers First Act fights back.
The bill, along with the amendment,
specifically requires transparency in
fair lending investigations, requires
interagency cooperation, and demands
diversity and inclusion efforts.
My home State of Florida has one of
the highest rates of consumer com-
plaints in the Nation. Some of it might
be due to the elderly population that
we have or the high number of just reg-
ular citizens who need protection.
What would these consumers do with-
out the CFPB? What would be their re-
course for Federal action?
Madam Chair, it is time that we put
consumers first. I urge my colleagues
to support my amendment and to sup-
port the underlying bill.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I be-
lieve this amendment will divert im-
portant resources away from pursuing
fair lending violations. I know that is
not my colleague’s intent.
We currently have an annual report
requirement under this very provision.
I do not think a monthly report would
give added clarity to Members of Con-
gress.
Moreover, when it comes to Federal
regulatory agencies under the jurisdic-
tion of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, I know of no other monthly re-
porting requirement we impose upon
regulators, and so this would be incon-
sistent with other pieces of financial
regulation and the law that we cur-
rently have.
If Congress wants to control more of
how the CFPB is using its resources,
we should bring them under the annual
appropriations process. That is a fun-
damental reform which is not included
in the underlying bill.
Madam Chair, I would say that while
my colleague has a very important
issue he is raising here and trying to
clarify on the actions of the CFPB and
ensuring that fair lending is enforced
reasonably, I concur with him that
that is an important and good thing,
but a monthly reporting requirement
will provide no additional clarity for us
as public policymakers.
Madam Chair, I stand in opposition
to the bill, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam
Chair, how many minutes do I have re-
maining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Florida has 21⁄2 minutes remain-
ing.
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam
Chair, I would say to the distinguished
member from North Carolina, who I
have enjoyed working with, during my
tenure in Florida, especially in the
Florida legislature, one of the biggest
complaints was for protection for the
consumers.
I spent my career there fighting on
their behalf, for the voiceless who did
not have a voice, and I continue with
this fight here, because I know the im-
portance of it.
Madam Chair, I can tell the gen-
tleman, if I walked out of here today
and just walked down the street and
asked an average person what was
more important to them, they would
say the consumer protection that they
feel that they don’t really have.
This is the most important legisla-
tion that I have seen since I have been
in Congress, because it goes straight to
the people who need it the most, our
veterans, our students, regular con-
sumers, just the average people.
Big banks and institutions have a lot
of protection, but the average person
does not have this protection.
Madam Chair, I can guarantee my
colleagues on the other side of the
aisle, if they vote for this protection, it
will be in the same vein of when our
great President Lincoln said that:
‘‘The world will little note, nor long re-
member what we say here, but it can
never forget what they did here.’’
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, in closing, I want to
commend the author of this amend-
ment, who is using this opportunity to
highlight his support of fair lending en-
forcement by the CFPB. I commend
him for that. I commend my colleague
for that. I believe he is a thoughtful
legislator.
I reluctantly oppose this amendment,
given the fact that we have already
provided in law and regulation an an-
nual report of this same data, and I be-
lieve that resources would be better
spent on protecting consumers directly
around fair lending violations rather
than reporting on a monthly basis
what they do on an annual basis.
Madam Chair, while I oppose this
bill, I certainly commend my colleague
for his passion, his care for consumer
protection.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. LAWSON).

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order

Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.

(a) REPORT ON DEBT COLLECTION COM-

‘‘SEC. 10’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentlewoman
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, I rise
today in support of my amendment to
H.R. 1500 and in support of the Con-
sumers First Act.
I also want to thank Chairwoman
WATERS for her leadership and her
stewardship in this endeavor.
I am proud to cosponsor this bill,
which will return the Consumer Bureau
to its intended role as a nonpartisan
consumer watchdog that protects the
interests of American taxpayers, not
those of special interests.
In 2017, the Urban Institute found
that 71 million Americans had a debt in
collection on their credit report. Mean-
while, collectors estimate they contact
consumers more than a billion times a
year—a billion.
During the 2008 financial crisis, peo-
ple lost homes, jobs, and hard-earned
wealth. This crisis was the prime ex-
ample of what can happen when nobody
is looking out for the consumers who
are left to navigate a financial system
built to confuse, mystify, and cap-
italize on the most vulnerable.
In response, Democrats created the
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau, an agency with the sole mission
of protecting consumers and holding
lenders accountable when they put
profits over people.
In my home State of Massachusetts,
46 percent of those living in commu-
nities of color have debt in collections
compared to only 18 percent of resi-
dents in predominantly White areas.
We know that debt collectors engage
in some of the most aggressive tactics:
harassing, berating, and even falsely
threatening legal action against vul-
nerable consumers.
My amendment would require the Di-
rector of the Consumer Bureau to issue
quarterly reports to Congress, includ-
ing an analysis of complaints sub-
mitted by consumers. The Consumer
Bureau’s complaint database has been
a crucial tool to monitor harmful in-
dustry trends and agency enforcement
efforts in defense of consumers.
Since the beginning of this adminis-
tration, more than 62,000 consumers
submitted complaints on harmful and
unfair debt collection practices. The
Consumer Bureau, under Director
Mulvaney and now Director
Kraninger’s failed leadership, has re-
turned zero—zero—relief to harmed
consumers.
My amendment will require the Di-
rector to report on the various enforce-
ment actions taken against these debt
collectors because we cannot afford to
go back to the days in which con-
sumers were left to fend for themselves
in a financial industry that was
stacked against them.
Information is power. The more in-
formation we have, the more power we
have to protect consumers from harass-
ment.
Recently, the Consumer Bureau re-
leased a proposed debt collection rule
filled with carveouts and loopholes
that would allow debt collectors to
more aggressively target and harass
consumers through emails and text
messages.
My amendment would prohibit the
Director from issuing further rules
that would essentially open the flood-
gates and allow collectors to bombard
consumers.
I urge my colleagues to stand with
consumers and to support my amend-
ment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. MCHENRY. I am opposed to the
amendment.
I would ask the amendment’s author,
if I am reading this correctly, that on
a quarterly basis they will disclose the
previous 12 months’ action.
Am I reading the legislative text?
Ms. PRESSLEY. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. MCHENRY. I yield to the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Yes, that is correct.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for clarifying.
Madam Chair, I would say that hav-
ing a quarterly requirement for an an-
nual report doesn’t seem like the right
approach. We currently have an annual
report, so what this amendment does is
simply say, on a quarterly basis, they
must provide an annual report rather
than have an actual annual report an-
nually. So this is really about micro-
managing the Bureau.
The Bureau currently reports on an
annual basis, as the Congresswoman
from Massachusetts outlined. More-
over, it not only changes that, it also
changes what is currently in the mid-
dle of a 90-day public comment period,
which is the regulations put forward on
May 7 by the Bureau on fair debt col-
lection practices.
What this amendment does is simply
say that, for debt collection purposes,
you can’t text or email a consumer.
That is what this amendment does.
That is not modern. That is not the na-
ture of how we communicate with our
smartphones in today’s environment.
What this amendment would do is
drive up the cost of healthcare, of col-
lecting on student loans. By not being
able to communicate with consumers
in a modern way, they will not have
the follow-up necessary so that con-
sumers will have some knowledge that
perhaps they owe money that they
didn’t otherwise know about.
And simply saying snail mail is the
way to go does not seem like what this
amendment should be about nor what
we should be about as a Congress. We
should be using all elements of tech-
nology to make sure that our financial
institutions, our government can actu-
ally communicate with people in the
way that they see fit. This amendment
limits that.
I think this amendment is unproduc-
tive. The public should have the right
to opine on the proposal put forward by
the CFPB, and the public should also
have the right to be communicated
with by their financial service pro-
viders in a way that they see fit.
So, with that, I do ask my colleagues
to oppose this amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, how
much time do I have left?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Massachusetts has 2 minutes re-
maining.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, I just
think it is important to remind my col-
league across the aisle that consumers
are being harassed aggressively, and
many of them did not even incur the
debt for which they are being harassed.
So we need to close these loopholes.
The current rule is rife with loop-
holes and carveouts and will open the
floodgates for debt collectors to further
bombard consumers. My amendment
will ensure that the Consumer Bureau
continues to put consumers first and
protects them from relentless harass-
ment. We simply want this data to be
accessible on a quarterly basis because
it will make it easier.
The Consumer Bureau is an inde-
pendent agency, and it needs to con-
tinue to operate as such. Under Dodd-

Frank, the Director is required to re-

of my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle are intended to weaken this
agency.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance

Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I am

Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair,
again, this is ultimately about hon-
oring the very mission of the Bureau,
and that is to put consumers first.
I support H.R. 1500, and I urge all of
my colleagues to support my amend-
ment, which will be a further effort to
protect consumers and to guard
against the harassment that so many
Americans are experiencing every day.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
I want to say to the author of this
legislation, I understand your inten-
tion. We have a rule that is out for
comment right now to get the public
feedback on this.
Moreover, I would say, under existing
law, harassment by debt collectors is
not permitted, period, under current
law. What is prevented, though, is
somebody who is trying to collect
debts from actually texting someone.
That is a problem.
I don’t think that is the intention of
this amendment, but that is the net ef-
fect, because the regulations put for-
ward say that you can text, you can
email, something that the Debt Collec-
tion Act, written before email, written
before text messaging, did not con-
template. We are updating this so that
people can be communicated with in a
modern way.
There is nothing more annoying than
finding on your voice mail some ran-
dom voice mail from somebody you
have never heard of, and you are sup-
posed to call this random person and
provide them information. How about a
text, right?
When I got a text from my pharmacy
that said, ‘‘Do you want to reorder
your prescription?’’ and I texted back,
‘‘Yes,’’ that saved me a phone call. I
liked it.
When talking about student debt, if
somebody doesn’t even know that they
have missed a payment and the debt
collector calls and they have got a full
voice mail, they may never know that
they missed a payment. If they got a
text or if they got an email, that may
be the way that they actually want to
be communicated with.
What we are talking about is innova-
tion; what we are talking about is mod-
ern communication; and what we are
talking about is reasonable regulation
to ensure that consumers, especially
students, are able to be communicated
with in the way that they seek and the
way that they like.
This amendment is premature be-
cause there is notice and comment out
under the rule that this seeks to undo,
and this amendment is unproductive
because it limits the rights of individ-
uals to be communicated with in the
way that they seek. That is what I
would say.
To Members of Congress, my friends
on the other side of the aisle, I would
also say that they are going back to an
old system. If they don’t want mod-
ernization under the current rule so
that people can be communicated with
in the way that they seek, I would tell
Members of Congress to not text or
email their constituents but only mail
them through the U.S. Postal Service.

this, and I yield back the balance of my

AMENDMENT NO. 6 OFFERED BY MR. BURGESS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 6 printed in

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I have

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, this
amendment permanently subjects
funding for the CFPB to congressional
appropriation and authorizes funding
for fiscal year 2020 at the fiscal year
2019 level.
The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau is currently funded by the Fed-
eral Reserve System, based upon a for-
mula. Congress has never been able to
fully determine the funding level for
the CFPB, limiting congressional over-
sight and the American taxpayers’
right to have a voice in these activi-
ties.
As Acting Director Mick Mulvaney
stated in his quarterly funding request
to Chairman Jerome Powell of the Fed-
eral Reserve Board of Governors: ‘‘By
design, this funding mechanism denies
the American people their rightful con-
trol over how the Bureau spends their
money. This undermines the Bureau’s
legitimacy. The Bureau should be fund-
ed through congressional appropria-
tions. However, I am bound to execute
the law as written.’’
If Democrats do not like the actions
of the CFPB Director, they should sup-
port returning control to the Congress,
to the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, to the people’s House,
through the appropriations process, as
was envisioned by the Founders in the
Constitution. This amendment simply
returns congressional oversight by
bringing funding for the CFPB under
our discretionary appropriations proc-
ess.
Madam Chair, I urge all Members to
support this important and common-
sense reform, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to amendment
No. 6.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from California is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, this
amendment would take the widely suc-
cessful consumer complaint database
dark, hiding from the public how con-
sumers report personally being harmed
by financial institutions.
The Dodd-Frank Act required the
CFPB to establish a consumer com-
plaint database to provide consumers
with the opportunity to report com-
plaints about financial products and
services.
A public database empowers con-
sumers to seek redress when harmed
and benefits the public by providing
firsthand stories to help other con-
sumers to avoid similar harms.
A public database also promotes mar-
ket discipline and encourages financial
firms to treat their consumers fairly.
The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau has received over 1.5 million
consumer submissions, with a 97 per-
cent response rate by financial firms to
the consumer complaints.
b 1415
This means that the American people
know, need, and use this function. Tak-
ing this away from the public only
harms hardworking people in need of
help and benefits the bad actors.
Through its research, education,
market monitoring, and the much-used
consumer complaint database, the
CFPB has been able to directly address
problems in the market and issues that
directly harm hardworking families.
This is especially useful for the mil-
lions of consumers who, unfortunately,
do not have the financial means, time,
or access to the judicial court system.
Mandating that the consumer com-
plaint database remain transparent
and publicly accessible is an important
aspect of this bill and will promote bet-
ter conduct from providers of financial
services across this country. Thus, I
urge my colleagues to oppose this
amendment to H.R. 1500, the Con-
sumers First Act.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance

public availability of all consumer
complaints, obviously a CFPB web
page. A provision of the bill requires
that all consumer complaints be made
available on a public CFPB website.
While it sounds like an attempt at
transparency, I am concerned about
how it will affect the entities against
which the complaints are filed.
We had a similar provision that was
included back in the stimulus bill, the
HITECH Act in ARRA in 2009, resulting
in the loss of consumer confidence in
healthcare entities because there was
no reporting required on remedial ac-
tion. That is, once you got on the list,
you could never get off the list.
The language of this bill requires dis-
closure of complaints, but there is no
information on which complaints must
be posted and whether they can be re-
moved. Will entities be publicly held as
guilty before an investigation is con-
ducted? Will there be a way to indicate
that remedial action has occurred?
Until these questions are clarified,
we must not subject entities to the im-
mediate disclosure of consumer com-
plaints.
This amendment strikes this provi-
sion so that we may thoroughly discuss
these issues before submitting them to
become law.
Madam Chair, again, I urge support
of the amendment, and I yield back the

Madam Chair, this amendment per-
manently subjects the funding of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
to congressional appropriation and au-
thorizes funding for fiscal year 2020 at
the fiscal year 2019 level.
The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau is currently funded through the
Federal Reserve System based on a for-
mula. Congress has never been able to
fully determine the fund level for the
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau, limiting congressional oversight
and the American taxpayers’ right to
have a voice in these activities. Acting
Director Mick Mulvaney so stated dur-
ing his quarterly funding request to
Chairman Jerome Powell of the Fed-
eral Reserve Board of Governors.
If the Democrats do not like the ac-
tions of the Director of the CFPB, they
should support returning control to
Congress, to the people’s House,
through the appropriations process.
This amendment simply returns con-
gressional oversight by bringing fund-
ing for the CFPB under our discre-
tionary appropriations process.
Madam Chair, I urge all Members to
support this commonsense reform, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from California is recognized for 5 min-
utes
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I oppose
this amendment because it seeks to
limit the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau by using the appropria-
tions process to politicize and defund
the agency.
All the bank regulators are independ-
ently funded. In addition to the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau,
the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the
FDIC, and the NCUA are all funded
outside of the appropriations process.
In fact, so is the FHFA, the FSOC, and
OFR.
Congress provided the regulators
with independence from the executive
branch and the appropriations process
to ensure that financial regulators fo-
cused on protecting the financial sys-
tem from harm.
However, ever since it was created,
Republicans have focused on the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau’s
funding because, more than any other
agency, it has helped level the playing
field between Wall Street on one side
and families, communities of color,
older Americans, servicemembers, and
students on the other.
Under the guise of the appropriations
process, Republicans are seeking to do
by amendment what they were unable
to do for the 8 years they were in
power, eliminate the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau entirely.
To that end, Mulvaney’s first request
for funds to be transferred from the
Federal Reserve to fund the CFPB’s op-
erations was zero. He later asked Con-
gress to turn the CFPB, which he pre-
viously called a ‘‘sick, sad’’ joke of an
agency, into an appropriated one.
In addition, Republicans often point
to the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission, which is subject to annual ap-
propriations, as an example we should
follow. What they seem to forget is
that during Trump’s 35-day shutdown,
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau remained open while the SEC was
effectively shuttered.
Advocacy groups like Americans for
Financial Reform also point out that
‘‘big banks would be able to use the po-
litically charged appropriations proc-
ess to deny funding for rule-writing or
enforcement actions that Wall Street
particularly dislikes. They could sim-
ply starve the agency of the basic funds
it needs to do its job or threaten to do
so in order to intimidate the agency
out of taking actions to curb abuses by
powerful companies.’’
The difference with Mulvaney and
the Trump administration is that they
have purposely sought to ignore or dis-
regard the law and the independence
Congress tried to create. Mulvaney,
who reports directly to Trump, clearly
ignored the law when he directed the
agency to stop supervising banks for
violations of the Military Lending Act.
Nevertheless, I am not surprised that
Republicans’ efforts to reform the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau in-
volve trying to starve the agency of
funding.
Madam Chair, Democrats want to en-
sure the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau can do and is doing its jobs
and puts consumers first. This amend-
ment does exactly the opposite, and I
urge my colleagues to oppose it.

Madam Chair, I reserve the balance

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Director Mulvaney in his quarterly
funding request to Jerome Powell of
the Federal Reserve Board of Gov-
ernors: ‘‘By design, this funding mech-
anism denies the American people
their rightful control over how the Bu-
reau spends their money, which this
undermines the Bureau’s legitimacy.
The Bureau should be funded through
congressional appropriations. However,
I am bound to execute the law as writ-
ten.’’
It says pretty clearly in the Con-
stitution that no money may be drawn
from the Treasury except as an appro-
priation by the United States Congress.
Most people do not accuse us of
underspending when it comes to the ap-
propriations process, so I fail to see
that as a valid argument.
Look, if you don’t like the actions of
the Director of the CFPB, support re-
turning the funding to the Congress,
support returning control to the Con-
gress so you will have the control that
you seek.
Madam Chair, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Madam Chair, I would like to reit-
erate my strong opposition to this
amendment.
Today, the House is trying to return
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau to its mission of putting con-
sumers first. This amendment, instead,
is meant to slow down and ultimately
starve the agency by using the appro-
priations process.
Madam Chair, my friends on the op-
posite side of the aisle have tried ev-
erything they could try to dismantle
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau. I think it is odd that they would
spend their time opposing what is good
for consumers and, yet, embracing the
very institutions that caused us to
have a recession in 2008 and to harm
the American people.
Madam Chair, I ask that everyone
oppose this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Chair, I rise today
to speak on behalf of Dr. BURGESS’ Amend-
ment to H.R. 1500, the Consumers First Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) has two primary flaws. First, Congress
does not oversee the agency, and a sole di-
rector determines its priorities. Second, in-
stead of securing funding through the Con-
gressional appropriations process, the CFPB
receives money from the Federal Reserve.
This funding method exempts it from budg-
etary limitations and is a prime candidate for
the irresponsible use of tax dollars.
These practices do not serve the American
people, those that this agency was designed
to protect. Because of this current lack of
oversight and accountability, the agency is vul-
nerable to political whims. An agency this
powerful should have Congressional oversight.
Dr. BURGESS’ amendment, which I am proud
to cosponsor, would help to right these
wrongs. It would subject the CFBP to the Con-
gressional appropriations process, just like
other federal agencies of similar scope and
size. This is not a partisan amendment: The
simple change would increase resistance to
political impulses and accountability to the
American people.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS).
The question was taken; and the Act-

Mr. COHEN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself 21⁄2 minutes. The coauthor of
this amendment is Mrs. BEATTY from
Ohio.
Madam Chair, this amendment will
allow consumers to obtain free access
to their credit scores. It directs the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
to require that consumer reporting
agencies disclose free credit scores to
consumers who make that request.
Federal law currently allows con-
sumers to obtain one credit report per
year from each of the major credit bu-
reaus that monitor consumer credit in-
formation. These free reports include
all the current data on which a credit
score would be based but don’t include
the credit score itself.
For consumers, this is kind of like
trying to figure out how well their fa-
vorite baseball team is doing based on
newly created analytics for the modern
sports fan and not for us who know just
home runs, ERA, and strikeouts. If not
for the current win-loss record, would
people be able to know how their team
is doing.
Good credit scores mean better inter-
est rates on mortgages, bank loans,
and credit cards; smaller deposits for
rent and utilities; and even lower in-
surance premiums.
As important as credit scores are,
they are still a mystery to most Amer-
icans. While most understand the fun-
damentals, such as the importance of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4095

paying bills on time, there is a lot of
uncertainty about how the credit score
is actually determined.
Many Americans don’t know, for ex-
ample, that maxing out your credit
card can be about as bad as making a
late payment. Many people also wrong-
ly believe their credit scores reflect
their income, age, marital status, edu-
cation, or even ethnicity.
A large majority of Americans are
unable to define a good credit score—
700—and many don’t know that small
changes in behavior could have a large
impact on the interest rates that they
will pay on loans.
With that in mind, this amendment
directs the CFPB to determine if agen-
cies should also disclose other con-
sumer information appropriate with re-
spect to consumer financial education.

People with poor or mediocre credit
scores pay for them with higher inter-
est rates, bigger security deposits, and
higher insurance premiums.
The one number that can make or
break someone’s financial future more
than salary is their credit score. I be-
lieve consumers have a right to obtain
their credit score for free from the
same source that supplies it to other
entities.
I would like to acknowledge my
former staffer, Michael Fulton, now an
executive with the Memphis Inter-
national Airport, who worked on the
original bill, the Fair Access to Credit
Scores Act, which I introduced 9 years
ago in the 111th Congress.
I look forward to working more on
this important issue with Chairwoman
WATERS and my partner on this amend-
ment, Congresswoman BEATTY from
Ohio.
I yield such time as she may consume
to the distinguished gentlewoman from
Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY).
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Chair, the in-
clusion of credit scores on the free an-
nual credit report is an issue that my
colleague from Tennessee and I have
worked on for several Congresses.
Under current law, all consumers are
entitled to a free annual report from
the three credit reporting agencies.
However, despite providing consumers
with all of the information that makes
up their credit scores, the free annual
report does not actually include a cred-
it score. That needs to change. Adop-
tion of this amendment would do just
that.
I want to thank Chairwoman WATERS
for working with us.
I also want to share that financial
literacy is a lifelong journey, and as
co-chair of the Financial and Economic
Literacy Caucus, I believe that knowl-
edge of one’s own credit score is essen-
tial. There are few three-digit numbers
as important to consumers as their
credit score. Despite the importance,
nearly 60 percent of U.S. adults are un-
aware of what their score is.
Whether applying for a home or an
auto loan, applying for a line of credit
or a credit card, or even applying for a
job, undoubtedly, a credit score plays
an integral role in the everyday finan-
cial lives of all Americans. I am asking
and urging my colleagues to support
this important amendment.
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Chair,
I rise in opposition to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Missouri is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Chair,
I rise in opposition to this amendment
that would place, I believe, an unneces-
sary burden on credit bureaus with no
benefits to consumers.
Currently, consumers have access to
free credit scores through the
annualcreditreport.com website run by
the big three credit reporting agencies,
or CRAs. On this website, consumers
can get three separate credit scores,
one at each of these three CRAs, for
free. This amendment will use the
CFPB to require that the CRAs provide
an additional credit score to con-
sumers. That is right, a fourth credit
score.
Specifically, the amendment requires
CRAs to use the credit score that is
most frequently used. What the legisla-
tion fails to mention is that the most
frequently used score is a FICO score.
FICO scores are not free.
This amendment requires that the
credit bureaus, all private companies,
purchase credit scores from FICO, an-
other private company; and in doing
so, it is mandating the transfer of po-
tentially hundreds of millions of dol-
lars from one company to another com-
pany.
One has to ask oneself, why is this
designed to punish these three CRAs or
to create a massive payday for FICO?
This is the USA, not USSR, not China,
and not Venezuela. The government
has no right to force a private company
to hand millions of dollars to another
private company simply because the
government official prefers one product
over another.
In addition, the chairwoman has in-
troduced legislation to reform the CRA
and has yet to bring a bill up before the
committee. I would imagine this
amendment that deals with credit
scores, not consumer protection, is bet-
ter suited to be debated under regular
order in our committee than thrown
onto a bill that seeks to amend CFPB
governance.
In short, this amendment has the
government picking winners and los-
ers, provides little or no benefit to con-
sumers, is irrelevant to the subject of
this bill, and should be soundly de-
feated.
This sets a horrible precedent,
Madam Chairwoman. We are dictating
one private company to pay another
private company for a service. When do
we ever do that? That is amazing
precedent to set. How can we do this?
We are not a dictatorial government
here. We allow the winners and losers
to be chosen by the people through eco-
nomic freedom. We don’t dictate who
buys a product from here and who buys
a product from there. That is what the
people are allowed to do on their own,
and that is what makes our country so
great is economic freedom to be able to
do that: pick and choose between what
companies provide what services and
which ones they want to pay for. In-
stead of dictating how one company
should pay another, we should be al-
lowing the freedom for them to choose.
Again, this amendment is about pick-
ing winners and losers. It provides no
benefit to consumers and should be
soundly defeated.
Madam Chair, is my understanding
correct that the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN) has no time remain-
ing?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Tennessee has 1 minute remain-
ing.
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Chair,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. COHEN. Madam Chairwoman, in
the minute that I have, I can’t read the
bill to the gentleman, but what the
gentleman talked about is not the bill.
It might be something somewhere up in
the stratosphere, but this has nothing
to do with picking one company, or
Venezuela, or some other communist
country. This has to do with giving
consumers the fair opportunity to see
what their credit score is.
That is America. That is fairness.
That is justice.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Chair,
I yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from North Carolina
(Mr. MCHENRY).
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chairwoman,
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’
There is landmark legislation in the
1990s that required a free credit report.
The underlying components of a free
credit report are given directly by the
agencies to the people. What this would
require is the CFPB to go purchase the
FICO, or take the FICO score, which is
derived from the underlying credit re-
ports.
The underlying credit reports are
much more meaningful in terms of the
value they provide to consumers. The
flaws that they have in them, con-
sumers can remedy.
We currently have existing law that
does the right thing here. I urge my
colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this, while
a thoughtful idea, a bad idea in how it
is constructed.
Mr. COHEN. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Chair,
I have the right to close, so I reserve

Mr. COHEN. Madam Chairwoman,

Madam Chairwoman, I ask that we
pass the bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Chair,
I yield the balance of my time to the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY), the ranking member.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, it is
insulting to hear a colleague say that
the other party does not care about the
consumer. That is absolutely wrong. It
is not becoming to the House, and it is
not becoming to the debate on this
House floor.
We care about consumers; we all do.
It is about how we take care of them
and how we defend them.
This is a bad amendment, badly con-
structed. We already have a free credit
report. We don’t need the CFPB to get
between consumers and their free cred-
it report. This amendment does that,
and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’

AMENDMENT NO. 9 OFFERED BY MS. BONAMICI

to consider amendment No. 9 printed in
part A of House Report 116–79.
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-

On page 33, insert after line 15 the fol-
lowing:
(5) REPORT ON RISKS TO YOUNG CONSUMERS
AND STUDENT BORROWERS.—Not less than
once annually, the Assistant Director and
Student Loan Ombudsman shall issue a re-
port to Congress containing an analysis of
complaints submitted to the Bureau by
young consumers and student borrowers dur-
ing the previous year and offering an inde-
pendent evaluation of risks to young con-
sumers and student borrowers posed by poli-
cies and practices in the marketplace for
consumer financial products and services.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentlewoman
from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oregon.
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Chairwoman,
I rise today to offer an amendment to
H.R. 1500, the Consumers First Act.
I thank Chairwoman WATERS and my
colleagues for their leadership in re-
storing essential functions of the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau,
which this administration so recklessly
rolled back.
During my years of work as a con-
sumer protection attorney, I learned
firsthand how strong consumer protec-
tion laws help to keep Americans fi-
nancially secure. This administration’s
efforts to weaken the CFPB have
harmed millions of people across the
country, including young consumers
and student borrowers.
I commend my colleagues for includ-
ing in the original bill the restoration
of the CFPB’s Office of Students and
Young Consumers, which this adminis-
tration closed last year. Shutting down
this office diminished the CFPB’s mis-
sion and weakened its enforcement ca-
pabilities.
Before its closure, this office re-
turned more than $750 million to stu-
dents and student loan borrowers
through actions against unscrupulous
student loan servicers. They also
helped more than 60,000 borrowers who
submitted complaints about the stu-
dent loan industry to the CFPB.
Notably, in January of 2017, the
CFPB and the Office of Students and
Young Consumers stood up to the Na-
tion’s largest student loan servicer,
Navient, for misallocating payments
and improperly steering borrowers
away from income-based repayment
plans.
The amendment I am offering today
with my colleague, Congressman HAR-
LEY ROUDA, would build on this office’s
critical role in protecting young con-
sumer students and student loan bor-
rowers. This amendment would require
the Assistant Director and Student
Loan Ombudsman of the newly re-
stored Office of Students and Young
Consumers to issue an annual report to
Congress on risks to young consumers
and student borrowers.
Specifically, this report would ana-
lyze complaints that were submitted to
the CFPB in the previous year by
young consumers and student bor-
rowers and offer an independent eval-
uation of the risks to this population
as a result of policies and practices in
the consumer financial products and
services marketplace. This report will
help us understand the risks that our
young consumers and borrowers face,
and it will help inform the work of
Congress on how to best fight back
against those who seek to prey on our
Nation’s young people.
I ask my colleagues to support this
important amendment that will help
students, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chairwoman,
I claim the time in opposition, though
I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, this is
a reasonable amendment that high-
lights the issues facing young bor-
rowers.
As I said in previous amendment de-
bate, in 2009 and 2010, the student loan
industry was nationalized. Ninety per-
cent of student loans are government
loans. It is the government that is put-
ting and saddling a generation of stu-
dents in unsustainable debt. That is
deeply problematic.
As a result of the pay-for of the ACA
and as a result of the pay-for under
ObamaCare, that industry is now 90
percent government. That is problem-
atic.
This amendment doesn’t deal with
the substance of that, though it does
deal with the risk factors associated
with young consumers and student bor-
rowers. I think it is important that we
highlight the needs of young bor-
rowers, the needs of students, and this
amendment will provide that type of
data on an annual basis. I think it is a
good amendment.
I appreciate the author for her will-
ingness to engage in this debate, but
also highlighting the need for us to
think more thoughtfully here in Con-
gress, think more deeply around finan-
cial literacy.
We passed a bipartisan resolution a
month ago that highlighted the Na-
tional Endowment for Financial Edu-
cation and the needs of financial lit-
eracy, the basic understanding of inter-
est rates, the time value of money, and
basic fundamentals of financial lit-
eracy that young people need to be
aware of and the population needs to be
aware of more generally. This amend-
ment gets to that subject matter that
is a bipartisan concern and is a bipar-
tisan approach to that bipartisan con-
cern.
So I urge my colleagues to support
this amendment. I thank the Congress-
woman for offering it, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Chairwoman,
I thank the gentleman for his bipar-
tisan support. This is an issue that we
all hear about from our constituents.
As a member of the Education and
Labor Committee, I know that we are
working hard on affordable higher edu-
cation; but, in the meantime, we need
to make sure that we are aware of the
problems that so many student loan
borrowers have. This amendment will
help us get the information through a
report, and I appreciate that this will
help us inform our approach here in
Congress, as well as get a better under-
standing of the practices of student
loan services.
b 1445
Again, I thank the gentleman for his
bipartisan support, I thank Chair-
woman WATERS for her support of the
amendment, I urge all of my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Again, I want to close by reminding
Congress and reminding my colleagues
that in 2009 and 2010 the Democrat
House, Democrat Senate, and Demo-
crat President nationalized the student
lending industry. Ninety percent of
student loans last year were done by
the government. Only 10 percent were
done by the private sector.
That is deeply problematic. It is gov-
ernment that is saddling a generation
of students with debt that is
unsustainable for them. The lost eco-
nomic potential as a result of that is

deeply problematic for our Nation and
for the individuals who are affected
here.
To highlight the risk factors facing
young consumers and student bor-
rowers is the right thing. For our Con-
gress to have that proper data is im-
portant, but do remember the nature of
what is happening in the student loan
industry is being driven by a proactive
decision of Congress to nationalize that
area of student lending. That is prob-
lematic. We need to resolve that issue.
It is an issue I want to continue to
highlight in any debate that we have
around student lending.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote for this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NUMBER 10 OFFERED BY MR. CASE
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 10 printed
in part A of House Report 116–79.
Mr. CASE. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:

‘‘(C) ensure that at least 1 member is an
expert in consumer privacy.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentleman
from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Hawaii.
Mr. CASE. Madam Chair, I rise in
support of my amendment to H.R. 1500
which would ensure at least one mem-
ber of the Consumer Advisory Board be
an expert in privacy.
Over a decade ago, predatory lending
and lax regulation led to one of the
most devastating financial crises in
our lifetime or any lifetime. The Bu-
reau of Consumer Financial Protec-
tion, or CFPB, was established by the
2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act in re-
sponse to this crisis. The CFPB is
tasked with implementing and enforc-
ing federal consumer financial laws
while ensuring consumer access to fair,
transparent, and competitive financial
products and services.
Under former Director Richard
Cordray, the CFPB returned roughly
$12 billion to over 30 million consumers
who fell victim to deceptive financial
practices, handled over 1.2 million con-
sumer complaints about financial
firms, reined in payday lenders, exam-
ined mortgage and student loan
servicers, combated discrimination in
lending, and held a number of bad ac-
tors accountable.
Under this administration, the
CFPB’s leadership ordered a number of
changes that weakened its ability to
protect consumers. This included firing
members of the Consumer Advisory
Board and reducing the size of the
board. This hurt the CFPB’s ability to
help and protect consumers.
The board’s experts help inform the
CFPB about emerging practices and
trends in the consumer finance indus-
try and share analysis and rec-
ommendations. It helps ensure the gov-
ernment fully leverages expertise of
those from outside of government.
H.R. 1500, the Consumers First Act,
would reverse anticonsumer changes
taken by the administration and
strengthen the Consumer Advisory
Board. The bill would require the CFPB
director to appoint at least 25 mem-
bers, at least two-thirds of which would
have to represent consumers, including
fair lending and civil rights experts and
representatives of communities af-
fected by high-priced mortgages. My
amendment would require at least one
member of that board to be a dem-
onstrated expert in privacy.
My amendment is needed because the
interplay of privacy and technology in
the financial landscape has changed
dramatically since 2008. As internet
connectivity increases, Americans now
transmit more of their personal and fi-
nancial information on the internet at
exponentially higher rates than in the
past, and their data is at risk.
Since 2013 there have been at least 10
major data breaches compromising bil-
lions of consumers. A number of these
breaches exposed consumers’ financial
information. For example, Marriott
International’s 2018 breach com-
promised the personal information of
some 500 million customers, including
credit card numbers of more than 100
million. In 2017 Equifax was breached,
exposing the personal information of
143 million consumers, including Social
Security numbers. In 2014 the Nation’s
largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, was
breached, compromising 76 million, or
two in three U.S. households. The list,
unfortunately, goes on and on.
In the wake of these high-profile data
breaches and privacy violations, con-
sumers are increasingly concerned
about their online personal and finan-
cial privacy. A recent Pew Research
Center public opinion study found that
over half feel that their personal infor-
mation is less secure than it was just 5
years ago, and 68 percent of internet
users believe current laws are not good
enough in protecting people’s privacy
online.
Our consumers are demanding action
on the issue of privacy, and our privacy
laws and enforcement significantly lag
much of the rest of the world. Obvi-
ously, the current system is not work-
ing to ensure that personal privacy is
protected.
My amendment responds to these
concerns by ensuring that an expert in
consumer privacy is part of the mem-
bership of the CFPB’s Consumer Advi-
sory Board. It will make sure that
these concerns are front and center at
the table as the board provides its ad-
vice to the CFPB.
My amendment is a small, yet impor-
tant, nonpartisan amendment in re-
sponse to the growing movement in
Congress and across the Nation and
world to protect consumers’ personal
data and basic right of privacy.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition, although
I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, this
amendment would ensure at least one
member of the Consumer Advisory
Board is an expert in consumer pri-
vacy. I think Congress has a proper
role that they can exert in the make-
up of boards, advisory boards, or make-
up of commissions, and I think this is
reasonable legislating around that.
We constantly hear from both finan-
cial firms and their regulators that cy-
bersecurity and insufficient data pri-
vacy standards are significant threats
to consumers and financial stability.
Moreover, as employees of the Fed-
eral Government, we know of Federal
Government data breaches of Federal
employees. We have to do more to
make sure that we stop that and stop
malicious state actors from these
cyberattacks.
Billions of people were impacted by
data breaches and cyberattacks in 2018
alone. The problem is only growing,
and the threats are becoming much
more sophisticated. Given the impor-
tance of this conversation, ensuring
that one individual on the Consumer
Advisory Board has consumer privacy
expertise offers a reasonable solution.
Madam Chair, I commend my col-
league from Hawaii for offering this
amendment. I urge my colleagues to
support it, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CASE. Madam Chair, I appreciate
the comments of my colleague very
much and the support. This clearly
demonstrates that when it comes to
consumer privacy, there is no party in-
volved. We are all concerned about it
regardless of our party. So I appreciate
those comments.
I would only add that certainly this
member of the board should deal not
only with data breaches, but also with
the basic rules and regulations that
govern privacy. We need a large, mas-
sive, and increased broad government
debate over our own rules on privacy in
this country where, in fact, we do lag
the rest of the world.
Madam Chair, I appreciate, again, my
colleague’s support, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the remainder of my time.
I commend my colleague for offering
this amendment. I urge my colleagues
to support it. It is a reasonable step for
Congress to say, clearly, that data
breaches, cybersecurity, and personal
privacy matter. As a matter of public
policy, we need to be interested in it.

I would also urge my colleagues and
reach out to the other side of the aisle
for us to have a deeper conversation
about cyber data and privacy. We need
to legislate in these areas.
Without our taking action, we are al-
lowing the Europeans to set the global
standard, and we are allowing the Eu-
ropean Union to set the standard for
our data and privacy here in the United
States. That is not appropriate. As
American policymakers, we should be
interested in legislating in a bipartisan
way to achieve that type of data pri-
vacy and cybersecurity that is nec-
essary for the American economy, not
just in the short run, not just for the
next election, but for the next genera-
tion to make sure that they are safe
and secure.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I commend my colleague
for raising this important issue, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 11 OFFERED BY MR. GOLDEN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 11 printed
in part A of House Report 116–79.
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 36, line 20, after ‘‘communities,’’ in-
sert ‘‘representatives of servicemembers,
veterans, and their families,’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentleman
from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maine.
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Chair, I first
want to thank Chairwoman WATERS for
her hard work and the hard work of the
committee on behalf of American fami-
lies in Maine and across the country
who have fallen victim to financial
schemes.
I rise today to offer my amendment
on behalf of military servicemembers
and veterans and their families. One of
the challenges that military men and
women face are countless financial
scams that exist in the financial mar-
ketplace. Travel just outside of a mili-
tary base, Madam Chair, and there will
be payday lenders with high interest
rates, title loan companies, and supple-
mental life insurance schemes all look-
ing for their next target.
Military personnel who are dis-
tracted by financial problems created
by these schemes cannot focus on doing
their jobs to the best of their abilities.
If the problems get out of hand, they
can even end a military career. On av-
erage, thousands of servicemembers are
separated each year from the military
for financial hardship and other issues
related to these types of schemes. Even
worse, many servicemembers or their
families come under pressure from
scammers while they are in the midst
of a deployment.
Just as an example of this, I was in
an infantry unit. I served in Afghani-
stan and Iraq. I have known people who
have actually taken the time, when
they get that rare opportunity, to hop
on to a sat phone. They should be call-
ing their family or a loved one, and in-
stead they are calling to talk to a debt
collector because they had fallen vic-
tim to one of these scams, then had it
turned over to a debt collector. By law
that is not supposed to happen, but too
often servicemembers don’t know what
their rights are and what the law is,
and they end up trying to deal with
this kind of a stress while in the midst
of a deployment to a place like Iraq.
We know it is not right. We need to
make sure struggling military families
can have resources that they can turn
to for help.
Unfortunately, these challenges don’t
stop upon leaving the service either.
According to a study done by the
AARP, nearly eight in ten veterans re-
port having received a scam attempt in
the last 5 years. I get them myself. I
get them in the mail. I get them from
people talking to me about my VA
home loan or education benefits and
others, offering what sounds like a
good deal, but we know it is not.
Recognizing the vulnerability of vets
and servicemembers to predatory lend-
ers and other financial scams, Congress
created the Office of Servicemember
Affairs at the CFPB. The office mon-
itors complaints from servicemembers
and veterans and their families and
takes appropriate action to protect
them.
Since 2011 the CFPB has received ap-
proximately 123,000 complaints from
servicemembers, and the problem is
not improving; it is actually getting
worse. From 2016 to 2017, there was a 47
percent increase in complaints received
from servicemembers.
My amendment helps ensure that the
CFPB can better protect veterans and
servicemembers from financial abuse,
fraud, and scams. The provision opens
up CFPB’s Consumer Advisory Board
to a representative veteran from the
military community and the veterans’
community.
The advisory board is a critical part
of CFPB’s role as a watchdog for con-
sumers. They inform CFPB about
emerging trends, they share analysis
and recommendations for action and
policies, and they assess the consumer
impact of emerging financial products,
practices, and services.
Putting a family member of a serv-
icemember or a veteran on the advi-
sory board will ensure that CFPB is
better informed of new and emerging
scams and tactics targeting service-
members and veterans so that we are
better able to protect them.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition, although
I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, this
amendment will help ensure that serv-
icemembers, veterans, and their fami-
lies have representation on the CFPB’s
Consumer Advisory Board.
As I stated with the previous amend-
ment, I think it is fair and just for
Congress to make the decision on who
should be members of the advisory
boards, various agencies, and the
make-up of boards and commissions as
well as for government.
Congress’ action in the past ensures
that men and women serving our Na-
tion do not fall victim to fraud and un-
scrupulous lenders, and this amend-
ment is consistent with those efforts.
b 1500
Moreover, I think there is a missed
opportunity in this bill. Mr. BARR, my
colleague from Kentucky, offered an
amendment before the Rules Com-
mittee to this bill to say that the Mili-
tary Lending Act gives explicit author-
ity to the CFPB. That amendment was
not made in order by the Rules Com-
mittee. I think it was a bad decision.
If my colleague supports defending
those in the military from unscrupu-
lous action, I would encourage him to
cosponsor Mr. BARR’s amendment be-
cause it is conforming with his very
concern about making sure that mili-
tary families and veterans are pro-
tected. The Military Lending Act and
the supervisory authority to the CFPB
is just the way to do that.
I am supportive of that measure. It
should have bipartisan support and
should have been made in order under
this amendment.
So, both sides of the aisle have these
concerns. I am grateful that the gen-
tleman from Maine and the gentleman
from Texas have offered a good amend-
ment.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Chair, I will go
ahead and close and leave it to the gen-
tleman to close on his end.
This amendment will help service-
members, veterans, and their families
make sure that they are protected fi-
nancially and give them a voice at the
table. I encourage my colleagues to
support it. I thank the ranking mem-
ber for encouraging his colleagues to
support it as well.
I would be happy to talk to our col-
league from Kentucky about ways in
which we can work together to protect
our servicemembers and veterans. I
know we are all in on that together, to
do the best that we can for our service-
members and veterans.
Madam Chair, I thank the ranking
member, the chairwoman, and the en-
tire committee for their support, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I urge
a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 12 OFFERED BY MS. ESCOBAR
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 12 printed
in part A of House Report 116–79.
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 39, line 24, strike ‘‘AND’’ and insert a
comma.
Page 39, line 25, insert before the period
the following: ‘‘, AND MILITARY- AND VET-
ERAN-SERVING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS’’.
Page 40, line 4, strike ‘‘and’’ and insert a
comma.
Page 40, line 4, after ‘‘businesses’’ insert
the following: ‘‘, and military- and veteran-
serving financial institutions’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I would like to thank
Congresswoman WATERS for her incred-
ible work and leadership on this bill,
which will help restore trust in Federal
consumer protections and ensure those
protections extend to all communities.
I also thank my colleague, Rep-
resentative GOLDEN, for cosponsoring
my amendment. This amendment
would direct CFPB to include rep-
resentatives of military- and veteran-
serving financial institutions in their
advisory committees.
There are over 18 million veterans in
America today and nearly 3 million De-
partment of Defense employees. Many
in these communities choose to bank
with financial institutions that cater
to their unique needs. These over 20
million Americans deserve a voice at
the CFPB from technical experts who
know how to best serve our veterans
and military.
We know that many military mem-
bers pick a financial institution and
stick with it. That is because these or-
ganizations have the skills and experi-
ence to help servicemembers with chal-
lenging circumstances, like frequent
moves and deployments, that the aver-
age civilian customer won’t face.
These organizations help support our
veterans and military at critical life
moments, providing early capital to
help start a business, helping finance a
new home, and even partnering with
educational institutions to provide
technical assistance to veteran entre-
preneurs.
They know the unique needs and con-
cerns of their clientele, including iden-
tity theft during deployments, VA loan
issues, and improper credit reflections
that occur when the VA experiences
administrative delays.
And they can share key industry in-
sight to help CFBP ensure vets and
servicemembers are protected as they
move through financial systems.
On a personal note, I share my home,
El Paso, with nearly 50,000 veterans
and am neighbors with more than 45,000
military and civilian personnel at Fort
Bliss. At Fort Bliss, we also train units
from every U.S. State and territory, so
our amenities end up benefiting many
outside our immediate community
over time.
Communities like ours deserve to be
heard, and my amendment will help en-
sure that that happens.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment,
though I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, this
amendment will direct the CFPB to ap-
point representatives of the military-
and veteran-serving financial institu-
tions to advisory committees. It is an-
other step in ensuring servicemembers,
veterans, and their families have a
voice in consumer protection.
Military- and veteran-serving finan-
cial institutions are unique and can
provide the CFPB advisory boards with
insights into the biggest risks facing
veterans, servicemembers, and their
families.
I do concur that there should be more
military representation across all
fronts at the CFPB and across the gov-
ernment.
Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Chair, I have
no further speakers or comments. I
urge all of my colleagues to support
my amendment and the underlying
bill, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I urge
a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

SEC. 9. REPORT ON SENIOR CONSUMERS.
Section 1016 of the Consumer Financial
Protection Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5496) is
amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(d) REPORT ON SENIOR CONSUMERS.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Director shall issue
an annual report to Congress containing—
‘‘(A) an analysis, in coordination with the
Office of Financial Protection for Older
Americans, of consumer complaints from
older Americans, including a State-by-State
breakdown of complaints by type of con-
sumer financial product or service; and
‘‘(B) any legislative or regulatory rec-
ommendations the Director may have to im-

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I first
want to join my colleagues in thanking
Chairwoman WATERS for her leadership
for so many years and, in particular,
her leadership in bringing this bill to
the floor.
We are here today to reinstate the
powers of the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau, which have been se-
verely weakened, and it includes the
curtailing of enforcement of fair lend-
ing laws and removing a standalone of-
fice on student loans. We must ensure,
however, that our elderly population is
included in this debate. We must not
leave our elderly behind.
My amendment is simple and
straightforward. It will require the Di-
rector of the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau to issue an annual re-
port to Congress of consumer com-
plaints from older Americans, includ-
ing a State-by-State breakdown of
complaints by type of consumer finan-
cial product or service.
Madam Chair, studies show that peo-
ple 50 and older hold 83 percent of the
wealth in the United States. However,
these same individuals, who grew up in
a workforce very different than the
evolving, technologically driven one of
today and who are experiencing aging
health disparities, are prime targets
for scammers. This has resulted in our
seniors losing anywhere from $2.9 bil-
lion to $36 billion each year from finan-
cial exploitation.
Having served as the director of my
State’s, Colorado’s, Department of
Regulatory Agencies in the past, I had
the honor of working on behalf of Colo-
radans to protect them from unfair, de-
ceptive, and fraudulent business prac-
tices. We certainly saw many of these
practices up close.
While I am proud that our depart-
ment was able to recover millions of
dollars for consumers across Colorado,
including senior citizens, we must do
more. In an era of sophisticated tar-
geting of our seniors, we must act, and
I certainly believe that is the case at
the Federal level.
So, in a world in which we continue
to hear of calculated financial fraud
and various data breaches, I believe we

should be working to protect all con-
sumers, not making it easy for bad ac-
tors to take advantage of them, in par-
ticular, making sure that we protect
vulnerable populations.
Madam Chair, that is why I encour-
age my colleagues to support this im-
portant amendment, and, with that, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition, though I am not opposed
to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, older
consumers are undoubtedly at the
highest risk of becoming the victims of
financial crimes. That is the unfortu-
nate case that we are facing today.
That is why, earlier this month, the
House passed multiple pieces of legisla-
tion to highlight the issues of elder fi-
nancial abuse and the mechanisms to
combat it.
The statistics on senior citizens who
are exposed to financial exploitation
are shocking. Older Americans lose ap-
proximately $36.5 billion each year to
financial crimes, scams, and abuse. One
in five seniors have reported being vic-
tims of exploitation, and only 1 in 44
cases of financial abuse are reported.
The gentleman from Colorado has of-
fered an amendment that will require
the CFPB to study and report on con-
sumer complaints filed by older Ameri-
cans and recommend legislative or reg-
ulatory actions to enhance consumer
protections to those citizens.
This amendment would increase
transparency and allow the CFPB to
identify trends in elder financial abuse.
Those insights could be used and can be
used to protect senior citizens.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I thank my colleague for
offering a good amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I thank
the ranking member for his remarks,
for articulating the need for this
amendment, and for his support. I very
much appreciate it.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 14 OFFERED BY MS. STEVENS

growth and jobs.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentlewoman
from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan.
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Chair, I rise
today in support of my amendment to
H.R. 1500, the Consumers First Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau is an essential agency that has
protected millions of consumers and
put more than $12 billion back in
Americans’ pockets.
I worked in the Obama administra-
tion, in the United States Department
of the Treasury, when the CFPB was
first established in the wake of the fi-
nancial crisis and saw firsthand how
this agency has grown to serve as a
force for accountability, transparency,
and fairness on behalf of working
Americans. That is why it is so impor-
tant to restore and protect the CFPB
from the attempts to weaken this crit-
ical agency.
My amendment to the Consumers
First Act ensures that community
banks, credit unions, small business
owners, or economic growth experts
are appointed to serve as members of
the Bureau’s Consumer Advisory
Board.
The Consumer Advisory Board is a
resource for the CFPB, providing the
agency with expertise, analysis, and
recommendations.
We must keep the channels open to
small businesses, smaller banks, credit
unions, and community advocates.
This amendment gives community-ori-
ented small businesses a seat at the
table when it comes to the CFPB’s de-
cisionmaking, while furthering the
goal of ensuring our financial system
works for everyone.
We need that on-the-ground informa-
tion. We need to hear from our small
businesses.
In my district, credit unions and
community banks offer helpful re-
sources to individual borrowers as they
look to purchase a home, start a small
business, or expand a manufacturing
order.
These institutions have invaluable
knowledge that we should take advan-
tage of as we work to protect con-
sumers from fraud and abuse.
My district, Michigan 11, is also
home to several thousand small busi-
nesses, including manufacturers and
the country’s most robust automotive
supply chain.
b 1515
We have got retail, we have got res-
taurants, and we have the capability to
continue to unlock the channels of in-
novation, but we need a CFPB that
works for us, and we need the voice of
the small business at the table.
Our small business owners contribute
so much to our communities, and they
have a finger on the pulse of our econ-
omy more than anyone else. We should
welcome the expertise of these key
stakeholders at the CFPB as they con-
tinue to do incredible work for the
American people and our economy.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
claim time in opposition to the amend-
ment, although I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, the
gentlewoman from Michigan has of-
fered an amendment that will help en-
sure the Consumer Advisory Board has
a balanced perspective by including in-
dividuals who represent community
banks, credit unions, and small busi-
ness owners, or economic growth ex-
perts.
Community banks, credit unions, and
small businesses are disproportionately
affected by heightened regulatory bur-
dens.
Dodd-Frank imposed 4,000 new Fed-
eral regulations on financial institu-
tions, including smaller institutions
that lack the resources of larger ones.
As a result of that, we have seen the
decline of nearly 2,000 banks, from
about 6,400 banks at the end of 2010, to
the end of last year, that number was
4,600. This is a significant issue for
community financial institutions, the
weight of regulation.
The number of credit unions has also
declined by nearly 3,000 over a similar
period of time, down to 5,600.
While community banking organiza-
tions, such as credit unions and small
community banks, represent 17 percent
of all U.S. bank assets, they make up
nearly half of all small business loans.
Small businesses account for over half
of all U.S. employment, and nearly
two-thirds of all employment growth
over the last decade.
These institutions fuel our economy
and spur job growth. They deserve a
seat at the table.
I commend my colleague from Michi-
gan for offering this amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Chair, I
thank my colleague from North Caro-
lina for his celebratory remarks. This
is an important day in Congress be-
cause this is the role that we play;
overseeing agencies, strengthening
their work and delivering for the
American people.
I have got to applaud our chair-
woman of Financial Services for the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
work that she has done, particularly
with this act. It is long overdue.
We are thrilled to introduce this
amendment that will bring the voice of
small business to the table.

May 22, 2019
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
As I said, small community financial
institutions have been disproportion-
ately affected by the regulatory burden
of Dodd-Frank, which has driven small
community banks to either merge, or
go out of business. Likewise, the same
for credit unions.
So for them to have a seat at the
table at the CFPB, I think, is right,
fair, and appropriate. I appreciate my
colleague from Michigan offering this.
I support the amendment, and I urge
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

ure insert ‘‘(decreased by $10,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentleman
from California (Mr. DESAULNIER) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Chair,
first of all, let me recognize the chair
of the committee, my friend from Cali-
fornia, for her steadfast work to defend
American consumers.
Madam Chair, students are in a dif-
ficult situation nowadays in the knowl-
edge-based economy, where we are told
over and over again that America, to
be competitive, has to have an edu-
cated workforce, and we need more and
more young people to go into college
and then to graduate school; not to say
that we don’t have needs for people to
get out of high school and go into ca-
reer tech.
But these generations are burdened
with unbelievable student loans, and
they are also burdened with, in urban
areas, high housing costs and also
lower wage expectations. We have to
fix this; and one way to fix it is to have
more oversight and performance stand-
ards for those companies, those for-
profit companies, in particular, that
control 93 percent of the market of
Federal student loans.
Madam Chair, 44 million Americans
hold an estimated $1.5 trillion in stu-
dent debt. Over 1 million borrowers de-
faulted on their student loans last
year.
Default is a financially devastating
event that affects the individuals many
times for the rest of their lives, as it
affects their credit standing and also
their ability to get a house, and to get
a good job. Default is a financially-dev-
astating event, as I said.
In the past decade, the Federal Gov-
ernment created several repayment
plans designed to assist borrowers in fi-
nancial distress, but the default rate
remains stubbornly high.
One major reason is the student loan
servicing industry. These for-profit
companies operate with little oversight
nor accountability.
Evidence shows that servicers often
provide inaccurate information and in-
adequate customer service, making the
already complicated process of enroll-
ing in the correct repayment plan close
to impossible.
My amendment would simply require
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau to collect and publish data from
student loan servicers, providing a
first-ever look at how these companies
perform at serving American con-
sumers. That is important.
These are basic performance stand-
ards that I would think all of my col-
leagues across the aisle would want in
any business practice—particularly for-
profit companies—they would want
performance standards for them, if
they are publicly-traded they would
want them for the shareholders and,
most importantly, for American con-
sumers and students.
For example, this amendment would
show if student loan servicers are mak-
ing it easy for their customers to recer-
tify their incomes for their repayment
plans. We know that this is a common
roadblock to successful repayment.
This amendment would simply re-
quire the CFPB to fulfill their statu-
tory duty and provide needed oversight
and transparency of this important in-
dustry. Everybody should agree that
more information, in this instance in
particular, is in everyone’s interest and
everyone’s interest in the future of this
country and future generations.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I am
opposed to the amendment. I appre-
ciate the gentleman’s interest in this
issue, but I have concerns with this
amendment.
Before I get into the substance of the
amendment, I do want to remind my
colleagues that the Democrat major-
ity, in 2009 and 2010, passed through the
House and the Senate, and got signed
by the President, the nationalization of
the student loan industry, giving it to
the Department of Education to admin-
ister.
Knowing their limitations, the De-
partment of Education, at the time,
contracted with loan servicers that are
private enterprises, but under the di-
rection and the regulatory enforcement
of the Department of Education.
Now, the Democrat majority is un-
happy, and the Federal Government is
crushing an entire generation with
debt by the decision they made to help
pay for the ACA or ObamaCare.
To get to the substance of the
amendment, this amendment would re-
quire loan servicers to submit consider-
able data to the CFPB, data that they
are already submitting to their pri-
mary regulator, the Department of
Education.
I am troubled by the sheer volume of
information that would be collected
and by the lack of definitive guardrails
around what the CFPB can and cannot
collect.
We had an amendment before that
said we need to have on the Advisory
Committee a privacy expert. Well, this
amendment runs counter to this need
for us to have enhanced privacy stand-
ards for those that are seeking loans,
and enhanced privacy standards for in-
dividuals in society, because this would
now require a second area of govern-
ment to collect data, sometimes
counter to what the Department of
Education would suggest is the right
and proper data to collect.
The Department of Education has au-
thority over student loan servicing,
and that work is performed on the De-
partment’s behalf under its regulation.
And the servicers fall under the De-
partment of Education’s regulatory au-
thority broadly.

H4102 May 22, 2019
While I support the spirit of this
amendment that was offered, I ask my
colleagues to oppose it.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Chair,
just briefly, while I respect some of the
issues brought up by my colleague, I do
think, if the data is already there and
they are supplying it for the Depart-
ment of Education, we should make it
relatively easy for the Consumer Pro-
tection Bureau to get that same infor-
mation and, if needed, get more.
As a former business owner, these are
the kind of performance standards I
would not be afraid to show to my cli-
ents; and I would think that Congress
and the American people, considering
the importance of this investment, at a
minimum, would require these kind of
performance standards.
So I would hope that Members on
both sides of the aisle would support
the effort in a spirit of transparency,
and performance standards for pri-
vately-held companies.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, in
closing, this amendment is not prac-
tical. It should be offered when we re-
authorize the Department of Edu-
cation. I would support it if it is man-
dated on the part of the Department of
Education to collect this data, which is
the right regulator of this nationalized
industry of making student loans.
Rather than collecting more data,
what we need to do is get into the ac-
tion of fixing the problem of student
debt. We need to make sure we have
more choices for students, better com-
munication with students, and a better
understanding of the consequences of
this massive debt load.
We can collect all the data we want,
but the Federal Government will even-
tually have to take responsibility for
these bad actions we have taken to sad-
dle a generation with student debt that
they cannot afford. I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentlewoman
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Chair, I am proud
to be a supporter of H.R. 1500, the Con-
sumers First Act. The act ensures that
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau serves its statutory purpose of
protecting consumers from unfair, abu-
sive practices, and holding greedy cor-
porations accountable when they take
advantage of people in our commu-
nities.
The residents of the 13th District in
Michigan are charged a whopping 369
percent APR rate by payday lenders.
According to the Center for Respon-
sible Lending, payday loans drain over
$4.1 billion in fees a year from people in
35 States that allow triple digit inter-
est rates for payday loans. Car title
loans drain over $3.8 billion in fees an-
nually from people in 22 States.
Madam Chair, together, these loans
drain nearly $8 billion in fees every
year, money that should be going to
pay rent or buy groceries. Instead, it is
going to line the pockets of predatory
lenders who are making record profits.
Across Michigan, 600 payday lending
storefronts each issue 3,000 loans a
year. Most of those loans are used by a
borrower to repay their prior loans;
and 90 percent of these loan borrowers
in Michigan re-borrow within 60 days.
This is why I am offering an amend-
ment that ensures that our residents
are protected from predatory lending
in the payday and auto loan industries.
This amendment will provide those of
us in Congress with the information
necessary to know how these industries
are operating and how our residents
are being impacted directly.
A doctor can’t treat a disease with-
out the necessary lab work or research.
This also applies to our ability, as pub-
lic servants, to push back against these
loans being offered in all corners of our
communities that push our residents
more into poverty.
b 1530
This payday lending amendment
would require the CFPB to report to
Congress quarterly the number of in-
vestigations opened and closed relating
to payday and car title lenders.
It requires an oversight report every
quarter on the number of enforcement
actions, an estimate of how much in
fees payday or car title customers pay,
how many times in the previous 12
months payday customers rolled over
their loans, and how many car title
loan borrowers lost their cars in the
previous 12 months.
Madam Chair, we have a responsi-
bility to tackle this debt trap crisis
that is set up for more profits for cor-
porations but leaves the American peo-
ple in financial despair with no escape.
In Michigan, predatory lenders are
looking to squeeze money out of low-
income people with deceptive and abu-
sive practices and have, unfortunately,
found a steady stream of business back
home in our districts.
Taking advantage of people in dif-
ficult situations is immoral, but com-
panies continue to stretch and break
the law for an extra buck, regardless of
the human cost.
In my district, Detroiters with pay-
day loans are more likely to file for
bankruptcy, be evicted, or face utility
shutoffs than any other Detroiter with-
out payday loans.
Madam Chair, I say to my colleagues,
these numbers are not unique to the
State of Michigan. Our constituents
are being harmed by these abusive,
greedy practices, and we have to make
sure we have all the information we
need to take action and protect our
families.
We know that many consumers who
are forced to get high-interest, high-
fees payday loans are targeted low-in-
come families. Many are taken advan-
tage of because they have relatively
few other places to turn.
According to the New York Fed,
more Americans than ever were at
least 3 months behind on their auto
loans, and it said delinquencies were
worsening among subprime borrowers.
Auto debt is now nearing $1.3 trillion.
Madam Chair, many of our constitu-
ents are a missed payday or a family
emergency away from being forced to
rely on payday loans or missing an
auto payment. Many are already in
that position. It is our job to make
sure we have the information necessary
in this body to protect them.
Madam Chair, this amendment
strengthens consumer protection, and I
encourage my colleagues to support it.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
would ask the author for a point of
clarification.
As I read it, the amendment requires
quarterly reporting to Congress. Is
that correct?
Ms. TLAIB. Will the gentleman
yield?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4103
May 22, 2019
Mr. MCHENRY. I yield to the gentle-
woman from Michigan.
Ms. TLAIB. Yes.
Mr. MCHENRY. Am I to read it cor-
rectly that that quarterly report is
supposed to give 12 months of data?
Ms. TLAIB. Correct.
Mr. MCHENRY. Okay. Madam Chair,
I thank the gentlewoman for clari-
fying.
Madam Chair, looking at this, that
means that on a quarterly basis, it is
an annual report. It is a bit clunky.
What we already see with the issues
of payday and car title lenders, we
know that those are State-regulated
products, but we also know, according
to the Bureau’s 2018 Consumer Re-
sponse Annual Report, payday loans
account for 0.7 percent of consumer
complaints, title loans account for 0.2
percent of consumer complaints. This
is less than 1 percent of the consumer
complaints the CFPB already deals
with.
The issues of reporting here, if this
were merely an annual report to repo-
sition the data that they put out on an
annual basis, I would not see that as a
burden or a major cost to the CFPB,
but doing an annual report on a quar-
terly basis would be more costly.
While I am not opposed to this data
being made public—I do think that
would be additive to the public—the
fact that this is a quarterly filing for
an annual report, I don’t think that
that is going to be quite as sensible as
it otherwise could be.
Moreover, if you look at the Con-
sumer Response Annual Report on the
consumer complaints to the CFPB, 80
percent of those consumer complaints
revolve around the credit reporting
agencies and credit repair firms.
I think we should be focused on that,
as a policy matter. I think there is bi-
partisan consensus that the credit re-
porting agencies need to undergo a
change in the law by which they must
abide to make sure that consumers are
protected and their data is protected.
This is bipartisan work that I hope
Chairwoman WATERS and I can engage
in this Congress. We have raised simi-
lar concerns about credit reporting
agencies in the past, and I do think
there is an opportunity for us to have
bipartisan legislating that protects the
consumer.
Madam Chair, I commend my col-
league from Michigan for offering this.
I know this is a major issue in Michi-
gan and a major issue for the question
of car insurance, the cost of car insur-
ance as well, and a number of other
issues that I know that she seeks to
remedy for her constituents.
Madam Chair, I appreciate the gen-
tlewoman raising this concern to us as
a body, but I respectfully oppose the
amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Chair, I do want
to clarify to my good colleague that
this is not an annual report.
We want to know, every quarter,
changes in payday complaints. So just
be aware that this is about a quarterly
report regarding those changes. This is
not an annual report.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I am
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Chair, I do want
to note the burden outweighs the cost
on our residents back home.
We need to be able to know exactly
what is happening on the ground at
home in regard to these kinds of prac-
tices and abusive behavior by payday
lenders.
We as a body need transparency and
understanding of what is going through
the CFPB, and we are not able to rem-
edy these challenges for our residents
without that information.
Madam Chair, I hope that we can
agree this is a bipartisan issue. This
would impact a majority of our States
across this Nation.
Madam Chair, again, I hope I can get
some support from my good colleague,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, in my
reading of the bill, I would suggest that
when it says, ‘‘the Director shall issue
a quarterly report to Congress con-
taining,’’ and then in subsections 4 and
5 it says 12 months of data, that 12
months is—I don’t want to be snarky
about it, but 12 months is a year.
So on a quarterly basis, CFPB has to
provide 12 months of data. That is what
I mean by on a quarterly basis CFPB
has to provide an annual report.
Twelve months being a year, a year
being annual, filing yearly is annual.
I don’t mean to be completely snarky
about it, but I think if we simply had
an annual report, this would be a much
better structured amendment.
Madam Chair, while I oppose the
amendment, I do so reluctantly.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 17 OFFERED BY MR. GREEN OF
TEXAS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 17 printed
in part A of House Report 116–79.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 31, after line 5, insert the following:
(g) RESTORATION OF RULE PROHIBITING
FORCED ARBITRATION IN CONSUMER CON-
TRACTS.—
(1) REPEAL OF JOINT RESOLUTION.—Public
Law 115–74 is hereby repealed.
(2) RESTORATION OF RULE.—Not later than
the end of the 3-day period beginning on the
date of enactment of this Act, the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau shall reissue
the final rule of the Bureau specified in Pub-
lic Law 115–74 (relating to ‘‘Arbitration
Agreements’’) in the same form as such rule
existed on the day before the date of enact-
ment of Public Law 115–74, except the Bureau
shall specify that the rule takes effect after
the end of the 60-day period beginning on the
date such rule is reissued.
Page 40, line 8, after the second dollar fig-
ure insert ‘‘(decreased by $10,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 389, the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. GREEN) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Texas.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I
am honored to present amendment No.
17, which deals with consumer choice.
It deals with whether consumers will
be forced into arbitration or whether
they will have the choice of having ar-
bitration or litigation.
With litigation, the consumer can
have the choice of having the case pre-
sented as one person or as part of a
group.
This amendment is one that the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act
called to our attention by way of a
study that was required.
After performing the study, the
CFPB issued a final rule to regulate
the use of mandatory arbitration
clauses. In so doing, it was something
that we believed would have been bene-
ficial to consumers. Yet, before the
rule could take effect, it was rescinded
by Congress in November 2017.
My amendment offers a direct,
straightforward solution. It simply re-
instates the CFPB final rule, a rule
that was the product of a careful study.
It was analyzed properly. It was done
by way of stakeholder consensus.
My belief is that this rule will rein-
state a law that will give consumers
choice as opposed to forced administra-
tion.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
CARTWRIGHT).
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Chair, I
thank my colleague from Texas (Mr.
GREEN) for yielding.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of the
Green amendment.
Madam Chair, to the Members of this
House, when we file into this room, we
file past a three-times-life-size statue
of Thomas Jefferson, one of our Found-
ers in this Nation. And Jefferson said
he considered a trial by jury ‘‘as the
only anchor, ever yet imagined by
man, by which a government can be
held to the principles of its constitu-
tion.’’
Trial by jury was that important to
Thomas Jefferson that he said it was
that important.
DANIEL WEBSTER, who is quoted up
here on our wall, said, ‘‘The law: It has
honored us.’’ Let us honor it by exe-
cuting it in its fullest severity.
How do we do that? We allow jury
trials for American citizens.
We teach our children account-
ability, responsibility, being account-
able for your actions. The way to do it
in America is to allow jury trials to de-
cide who is at fault.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4104 May 22, 2019
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Chair, I rise
only to commend the gentleman from
Texas for his important work on this
arbitration issue.
There has been a very effective move-
ment to quash the rights of consumers.
In the financial services area, people
are told to deal with it.
Our colleague HANK JOHNSON has the
Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal
Act as it relates to nursing homes and
employment. Our colleague KATHERINE
CLARK has a bill to repeal these arbi-
tration restrictions with reference to
discrimination on the basis of sex and
sexual harassment in the workplace.
Each of these is very important.
Arbitration is arbitrary. It does not
fairly resolve disputes. It is biased to-
ward the financial institution, and to-
ward the employer and others in other
cases. Arbitration is a model that does
not work well to solve most disputes of
this type.
It has even been suggested, amaz-
ingly enough, to bring arbitration into
the drug price debate now. I don’t be-
lieve arbitration is a way to solve these
problems, and it is certainly not a way
to get us lower drug prices.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair,
how much time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas has 11⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, the
gentleman’s amendment would rein-
state a bad rule by the CFPB that was
repealed.
The CFPB’s own data demonstrates
that consumers fare better under arbi-
tration than under litigation. On aver-
age, plaintiffs’ attorneys account for
approximately 31 percent of payments
plaintiffs receive from class action set-
tlements. Plaintiffs’ attorneys collect,
on average, $1 million per case; actual
plaintiffs receive just $32 each.
If Members want to be consumer
friendly, if Members are about con-
sumer protection, let’s let the con-
sumers get the benefit if they are
wronged rather than trial lawyers and
the trial bar.
This is a trial lawyer’s dream amend-
ment.
Madam Chair, I oppose this amend-
ment and ask my colleagues to vote
‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair,
who has the right to close?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman in
opposition, the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY), has the right
to close.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, this is a consumer’s
dream come true because it gives the
consumer choice.
It does not deny the business owner,
the credit card company, or the bank
the opportunity to have arbitration.
What it does is it allows the consumer
to have the choice to either elect to
have arbitration or to go to litigation,
and when litigating, the consumer can
litigate as an individual.
b 1545
When I was a judge of a small claims
court, I had many persons who were
litigating their cases before me. I also
understand that there are times when
people believe that they should have
lawyers to represent them. It is not un-
usual for businesses to have lawyers to
represent them. In fact, businesses
have lawyers on call to represent them
24 hours a day.
Why can consumers not have the
same opportunity to litigate that busi-
nesses have to litigate? That is what
this is all about. My colleague, on the
other side, would simply have con-
sumers have no choice, go to arbitra-
tion only, and then, possibly, gain
some emolument.
My belief is that consumers ought to
have choice. That is what this amend-
ment is about.
Madam Chair, this is part of the rea-
son why consumers are so angry with
this Congress. We deny them their con-
stitutional rights, the right to a trial
and the right to make a determination
for themselves as to whether or not
they will engage in arbitration or liti-
gation.
Consumers should have choices. Busi-
nesses have choices. Consumers should
have no less than what businesses
have.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Madam Chair, let me just reiterate:
This amendment is for trial lawyers.
That is what they are trying to rein-
state, forcing consumers into the hands
of trial lawyers. Every million dollars
plaintiffs receive in attorney’s fees, the
actual plaintiff, the one who is harmed,
the one who is wronged, receives, on
average, $32. That is not fair. That is
not equitable. That is not right.
It is not defending an abstract con-
cept. It is actually defending those con-
sumers’ right to receive compensation
for the harm that they have experi-
enced. Also, it allows that consumer to
enter into contractual agreements with
people they seek to.
This amendment would reinstate a
rule that would take that consumer’s
right away from them and put it into
the hands of the trial lawyer once
again. It is a profit center. It certainly
is.
In November last year, the President
signed a joint resolution passed by
Congress disapproving of the arbitra-
tion rule under the Congressional Re-
view Act. Congress spoke, in the House
and in the Senate, and we changed the
law.
Pursuant to the joint resolution, the
arbitration agreement rule has no force
or effect. That means, moreover, that a
rule similar to that can no longer be
written going forward. That is under
the Congressional Review Act.
This amendment serves as little more
than a payday for plaintiffs’ attorneys.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Texas will be post-
poned.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR
The Acting CHAIR (during the vote).
There is 1 minute remaining.
b 1629
So the amendment was rejected.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
(By unanimous consent, Ms. PELOSI
was allowed to speak out of order.)
HONORING USCP CHIEF VERDEROSA
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Chair, I am
pleased to rise to join our distinguished
Republican leader, Mr. MCCARTHY, to
honor the dedicated, distinguished
service of an outstanding public serv-
ant, United States Capitol Police Chief
Matthew Verderosa.
Madam Chair, throughout 34 years in
law enforcement, Police Chief
Verderosa has proven himself as a lead-
er of the highest patriotism and profes-
sionalism and has proudly carried forth
the Capitol Police’s nearly two-century
history of storied service.
Chief Verderosa has held seemingly
every consequential job in the Capitol
Police, from the fields of emergency re-
sponse, to dignitary protection, to the
highest ranks of leadership.
Through it all, he has distinguished
himself for his strong, steady leader-
ship, particularly during some of the
most challenging times for the Capitol
Police force and the Congress.
That outstanding leadership was on
display after the 2017 congressional
baseball shooting, 2 years ago next
month. Chief Verderosa responded to
that attack with courage, vision, and
grace, bringing help and healing to
those affected and to our entire con-
gressional community.
In every day of his tenure, he has led
with those same qualities, navigating
everything from mass protests, to the
more than 11 million annual visitors to
the Capitol Grounds, to multiple Lying
in State and Lying in Honor cere-
monies.
Chief Verderosa has earned the re-
spect of all: the rank-and-file officers
of the Capitol Police, Members of Con-
gress, foreign dignitaries, and the
American people.
On a personal note, as someone who
benefits from the protection of the
Capitol Police every day and every-
where I go, I want to express my grati-
tude to Chief Verderosa for his hard
work and commitment to the safety of
all Members.
In his retirement statement, Chief
Verderosa said: ‘‘The mission of the de-
partment is simple. We protect the leg-
islative process.’’
Chief Verderosa, thank you for your
relentless dedication to protecting the
legislative process and this legislative
body, ensuring that the people’s House
can do the people’s work. We are pro-
foundly grateful. We wish you well in
your well-earned retirement.
Madam Chair, I yield to the distin-
guished gentleman from California
(Mr. MCCARTHY), who is the Republican
leader of the House.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Chair, I
thank the Speaker for yielding, and I
thank her for her words. I want to join
the Speaker in thanking the chief.
Three decades, 34 years—it is not a
job; it is a way of life when you become
a police officer. Your job is a little dif-
ferent, and we see it each and every
day.
Think of the complexity of being a
Capitol Police officer. It is not just the
safety of the women and men who serve
in here; it is the thousands of visitors
who come every day. But it is also the
responsibility of keeping a government
by the people, for the people, and of the
people open.
Every day we see it, and we all have
felt it. It is not just protecting us when
it is inside this building. We saw it just
a short time ago on a baseball field. We
are reminded of the number of Mem-
bers’ lives your officers saved that day.
We are reminded of the number of
times, just in a building that the ma-
jority leader room has, of the officers
giving the ultimate sacrifice inside
these Hallowed Halls to save the oth-
ers.
So we thank you for your work, but,
more importantly, we thank you for
the force. We thank you for all the offi-
cers.
We know last week was National Po-
lice Week. They were here in the Cap-
itol and throughout Washington, D.C.
We know every day that we hear the
other lives that were lost protecting us
throughout the Nation.
We thank you for your service, and
on behalf of a very grateful Congress,
thank you for your decades of service,
and we wish you all the best in retire-
ment.

b 1654
So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. BARRAGÁN).
There being no further amendments,
under the rule, the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.
JACKSON LEE) having assumed the
chair, Ms. BARRAGÁN, Acting Chair of
the Committee of the Whole House on
the state of the Union, reported that
that Committee, having had under con-
sideration the bill (H.R. 1500) to require
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau to meet its statutory purpose, and
for other purposes, and, pursuant to
House Resolution 389, she reported the
bill, as amended by that resolution,
back to the House with sundry further
amendments adopted in the Committee
of the Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
Is a separate vote demanded on any
further amendment reported from the
Committee of the Whole? If not, the
Chair will put them en gros.
The amendments were agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I have a
motion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. STEIL. I am opposed to the bill
in its current form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Steil moves to recommit the bill H.R.
1500 to the Committee on Financial Services
with instructions to report the same back to
the House forthwith with the following
amendment:
Page 40, after line 8, insert the following:
SEC. 9. PAYMENTS TO VICTIMS FROM THE CIVIL
PENALTY FUND.
Paragraph (2) of section 1017(d) of the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (12
U.S.C. 5497(d)(2)) is amended to read as fol-
lows:
‘‘(2) PAYMENTS TO VICTIMS.—No funds from
the Civil Penalty Fund shall be made avail-
able for any purpose other than compen-
sating actual victims of activities for which
civil penalties have been imposed under Fed-
eral consumer financial laws.’’.
Page 40, line 9, strike ‘‘SEC. 9’’ and insert
‘‘SEC. 10’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes
in support of his motion.
b 1700
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, this is
the final amendment to the bill. It will
not kill the bill or send it back to com-
mittee. If adopted, the bill will imme-
diately proceed to final passage, as
amended.
Madam Speaker, the Dodd-Frank Act
created the Consumer Financial Civil
Penalty Fund, into which the Bureau
deposits civil penalties it collects from
wrongdoers.
Civil penalties should be used exclu-
sively to make victims of financial
consumer crimes whole. We should
track down actual victims of fraud.
However, current law allows the Bu-
reau to use this account as a slush
fund.
We should give the money back to
the victims.
This motion would put an end to the
CFPB slush fund. This motion requires
the CFPB to do the right thing: Give
the money to the victims.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4109
May 22, 2019
The CFPB’s ability to take away pen-
alty funds and use them in unaccount-
able ways is unparalleled among finan-
cial regulators.
Where does this money go?
Both the Government Accountability
Office and the Federal Reserve’s In-
spector General, which oversees the
CFPB, found that the CFPB lacks in-
ternal procedures. The CFPB lacks ac-
countability. The CFPB lacks trans-
parency.
Where does this money go?
Let’s put an end to the slush fund at
the Bureau. Let’s redirect where this
money belongs. Let’s give the money
to the victims.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’
on this motion to recommit.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
in opposition to the motion to recom-
mit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today, not just as a new Member of
Congress, but as someone who has
spent my career as a consumer protec-
tion lawyer studying families pushed
to the brink of financial ruin.
I have sat all day long listening to
the personal stories of families driven
to bankruptcy by predatory loans, fi-
nancial scams, and unlawful and im-
moral debt collectors.
I rise today as someone who has per-
sonally spoken to thousands of families
in foreclosure; as someone who has had
to look into the eyes of parents and
children and tell them: ‘‘I’m sorry, but
the bank is going to take your house.’’
These are not experiences that some-
one can forget. I carry these stories of
California families with me every day.
That is why I ran for office. It is why
I stand up for a level playing field for
families.
I cannot fathom how the minority,
with this amendment, is shrugging off
the devastation of the 2008 collapse.
Ten years ago, in 2009, Orange County
was coming off a year when home
prices fell 30 percent. Imagine being a
family planning for retirement and, all
of a sudden, your primary source of se-
curity is gone.
Ten years ago, in May 2009, Cali-
fornia had an unemployment rate of 11
percent.
Do Members of this body not remem-
ber how many of our friends and neigh-
bors spent sleepless nights wondering if
they could keep a roof over their
heads?
The 2008 economic collapse cast a
long shadow. One study from the CDC
found that suicides, spurred by evic-
tions and foreclosures, doubled between
2005 and 2010. Those are going to be dif-
ficult victims to locate.
Because of this human tragedy, Con-
gress acted and created the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau, an agen-
cy whose sole focus is to ensure that fi-
nancial services companies and Wall
Street megabanks could not again
cheat families and tank our economy.
We created the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, even though special
interests were spending $3 million a
day to defeat it. Think about it; an in-
dustry so wealthy that even in its col-
lapse, they had $40 million to spend on
lobbyists.
Now these same special interests are,
again, attacking the CFPB. This
amendment is just another effort by
the same Members who voted against
the CFPB’s very creation to limit the
agency’s effectiveness.
In my nearly 2 decades as a consumer
advocate, I have never met a single
American, Democrat, Republican, or
Independent, who likes being cheated.
If the Members today were listening to
their constituents, and not special in-
terests, they would support the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau.
I am a proud capitalist, and it is in
that deep belief in healthy and strong
markets, that I rise today in opposi-
tion to this motion to recommit.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on the
question of passage.
This is a 5-minute vote.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—ayes 191, noes 231,

HONORING NURSES
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in honor of all the nurses, the
healers who tirelessly serve patients
across our Nation. I thank them for
their dedicated service to heal, care
for, and serve people across all our
communities.
Our country is facing a dire shortage
of healthcare workers. Whether nurses,
primary care physicians, psychiatrists,
behavioral health specialists, or tech-
nicians, you name it, the growing
shortage of workers is exacerbating the
already high cost of healthcare, mak-
ing high-quality care that much hard-
er.
Right now, in my own district, thou-
sands of nurses and healthcare workers
are on strike at a hospital owned and
operated by the Bon Secours Health
System, a $3.8 billion not-for-profit
based in Maryland that owns or man-
ages more than 20 health-related insti-
tutions in seven States.
The nurses at St. Vincent hospital
are striking on quality of life issues:
overtime, mandatory on-call, and, iron-
ically, healthcare for them and their
families.
The struggle these workers and these
patients are facing is on my mind
every minute, and I continue to urge a
real dialogue from the company. Go
back to the table and bargain to get
our nurses back on the job peacefully
and productively.
Meanwhile, I urge my colleagues to
reauthorize title VIII of the Nursing
Workforce Act and amend the Public
Health Service Act to establish direct
care registered nurse-to-patient staff-
ing ratio requirements in hospitals.
Finally, Congress must do more to
protect and improve DSH payments
that help hospitals provide charity
care for vulnerable, uninsured patients,
so many of whom come into St. Vin-
cent hospital.
f
CELEBRATING 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to commemorate
and celebrate the 100th anniversary of
the House passage of the 19th Amend-
ment to amend the Constitution to
guarantee women the right to vote.
The struggle for women’s suffrage
was not an easy one, taking over a gen-
eration of women fighting to see it
through to the end. Women like Susan
B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, and Eliza-
beth Cady Stanton took a great risk,
stepping out of what many thought to
be the role of women at the time to
argue about the injustice they were
facing.
After speeches, petitions, and failed
attempts at change, the initial group
of women were not able to see their
work through to the end but made
great strides that enabled future
women to finish the job.
On this anniversary, I hope that we
will all take the time to remember the
hard work that these women had to put
in to gain equal voting rights, to re-
member where our country has been
and how we got to where we are today,
and to remember that the right for ev-
eryone to vote is central to our democ-
racy and a right that we need to con-
tinue to protect.
I am grateful for the women who led
this effort 100 years ago, and I believe
that it is something that should inspire
all of us.
f
CONTINUE FUNDING ALZHEIMER’S
RESEARCH
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
right now, we face a health crisis.
Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative
brain disease and the most common
form of dementia; 5.8 million Ameri-
cans have this disease. One in three
seniors dies with Alzheimer’s. It is the
sixth leading cause of death in the
United States of America, and it kills
more than breast cancer and prostate
cancer combined.
Nancy Reagan called the illness ‘‘a
truly long, long good-bye.’’
There are organizations and people
working tirelessly on the research
being done to fight and prevent these
statistics from increasing, but they
face three major roadblocks: soaring
prevalence, lack of effective treatment,
and enormous costs.
The United States and the world face
this crisis, and we must continue to
support the funding of research for this
incredibly devastating disease.
Someday, we will win. Someday,
there will be a cure.
f
HONORING DANTE TINI
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, as
we head into Memorial Day weekend, I
want to honor an American hero who
paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to
our country.
Radioman 3rd Class Dante Tini from
Virginia, Minnesota, was stationed
aboard the USS Oklahoma in Pearl
Harbor on Sunday, December 7, 1941,
when torpedoes ripped through the hull
of the ship. Thirteen days later, he was
declared missing in action. He was just
19 years old.
For 77 years, Dante Tini’s family
prayed for answers and closure. Just
last year, Dante’s remains were
matched with his family, beginning the
process of returning him home.

H4112 May 22, 2019
This Saturday, Dante Tini will be
laid to rest next to his parents in his
hometown of Virginia, Minnesota,
which was his wish when he enlisted.
It was an honor and privilege for my
office to help in coordinating this ef-
fort, and we look forward to this Satur-
day when we join his family to wel-
come him home.
While this Memorial Day is a special
day to pay tribute to the fallen, it is
important to keep their memory alive
and to pay tribute to these special
Americans like Dante Tini year-round.
God bless the family of Dante Tini,
and I ask for continued prayers for our
country.
f
CELEBRATING BICENTENNIAL OF
MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, today
is the 200th anniversary of the city of
Memphis, Tennessee, the city of my
birth, where I am a fourth-generation
Memphian. I am proud of my city and
honored to represent it in the United
States Congress.
Memphis is a city that is well known
for the National Civil Rights Museum
that has turned like a phoenix the site
of the assassination of Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King into a shrine for civil rights
history and civil rights work in our
country.
It is a home of music, Stax Museum
of American Soul Music, Sun Records,
and Graceland. It is a city of great bar-
becue, real barbecue, pork. It is a city
of basketball, both the Memphis
Grizzlies and the Memphis Tigers. And
it is a city of marvelous people.
It is a great city. Come celebrate
with us the 200th birthday of Memphis,
the great city that it is.
f
RECOGNIZING ARIZONA PUBLIC
SERVICE
(Mr. BIGGS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, today
highlights another success story from
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Arizona Public Service, the largest
electric utility in Arizona, recently an-
nounced that it will again be lowering
electricity rates to customers. Arizo-
nans can now expect to save more than
$100 a year on their electricity bill
thanks to the Republican-led tax re-
form package signed by President
Trump.
These savings are not crumbs. They
are real, and they will benefit millions
of people across our State. APS serv-
ices about 2.7 million people and oper-
ates the Palo Verde Generating Sta-
tion, which is the largest source of
clean-air energy in the United States.
The Palo Verde nuclear power plant
has 2,500 full-time employees and gen-
erates an economic impact of more
than $2 billion to our State.
Madam Speaker, the 100-degree tem-
perature days are upon us, and I know
firsthand how expensive summertime
bills can be. This announcement by
APS is yet another example of Arizo-
nans winning because of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act.
f
RECOGNIZING HAITIAN HERITAGE
MONTH
(Ms. PRESSLEY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in recognition of the signifi-
cant cultural and economic contribu-
tions the Haitian diaspora has made to
America.
The month of May marks Haitian
Heritage Month, an expansion of Hai-
tian Flag Day, which is celebrated an-
nually on May 18. As the first Black re-
public in the world to abolish slavery,
the Haitian people continue to dem-
onstrate patriotism, resilience, sac-
rifice, love, and Haitian pride.
Last weekend, I joined my Haitian
brothers and sisters in the Massachu-
setts Seventh for a Flag Day celebra-
tion in Randolph and a Haitian-Amer-
ican Unity Parade in Mattapan. We
waved this flag, shouting, ‘‘Haiti,’’ and,
‘‘Unity is strength,’’ ‘‘L’union fait la
force.’’
Massachusetts Seventh is one of the
most diverse districts in the country,
and the Haitian diaspora is a funda-
mental part of our district. We have
the first-in-the-Nation Haitian-Creole
pre-K dual language program at the
Toussaint L’Ouverture Academy. We
have some of the most influential Hai-
tian leaders in the country, like Marie
St. Fleur, Linda Dorcena Forry, Jean
Bradley Derenoncourt, Natacha
Clerger, and Eunice Zeigler, to name a
few.
With many Haitian Americans con-
tributing to our economy and society,
they deserve more than TPS renewal.
They deserve a pathway to permanent
residency. Haitian Americans and the
Haitian-American United network have
made significant contributions to this
country for decades. They are owed
residency.
We must continue to affirm the dig-
nity of Haitian Americans and to de-
mand that this administration see
their humanity.
f
EMBRACE HISTORY
(Mr. WRIGHT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WRIGHT. Madam Speaker, now
we have a Democratic Presidential
candidate who seems to think that
some things named to honor Thomas
Jefferson should be renamed, going as
far as to say, ‘‘It’s the right thing to
do.’’ Well, maybe he should go back to
school and learn about the stunning
impact our Founding Fathers had not
only on American history but the his-
tory of the world.
To use 21st-century sensibilities to
help frame the future may be a good
thing, but to use those same sensibili-
ties to judge the past or, worse, to
erase parts of our history is simply stu-
pid.
If we measure historical figures and
places against a model of perfection,
nobody and no nation will ever meet it.
We must celebrate the achievements of
the past and learn from its mistakes
without erasing or rewriting the parts
that make 21st-century Americans un-
comfortable.
The story of America is the story of
progress, of advancement, of always
getting better. We should embrace that
history in its totality.
f
HONORING FATHER ANGELO
CASERTA
(Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam
Speaker, today, I honor the life of a
great man. Born in Piqua, Ohio, Father
Angelo Caserta was the oldest active
priest in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.
He peacefully passed away last week.
Those who knew Father Caserta re-
call his talent and love for people, his
comforting words, and his love for our
community.
When asked about the secret to his
longevity, Father Caserta said: ‘‘My se-
cret is the good Lord. The Lord gets all
the credit. I’m the only classmate sur-
viving in my class. Not many average
that milestone. . . . It’s a celebration
of God’s goodness, how He could choose
someone like me and take care of me
for 70 years while doing his work in the
priesthood.’’
On Tuesday, Father Caserta’s life
was celebrated in Piqua, as he was laid
to rest by family and friends.
While I did not know him personally,
I knew of his deeds by those who did
and the love he had for our community.
Madam Speaker, I use my time on
the floor today to honor Father
Caserta’s life of service, to celebrate
his faith, and to extend my condolences
to those who knew him.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4113
May 22, 2019
pulling together around the ideal of en-
suring that the communities have in-
tegrity, not of just response, but of re-
covery, one particular story of heroism
has emerged that I would like to share.
Mr. James Wilke, and he is pictured
right here, was a farmer. He was a
farmer from Columbus, Nebraska, near
Columbus in Platte County. Mr. Wilke
gave his life during the flood.
What happened is he got a call from
volunteer rescuers about someone who
was stranded in a car fairly near his
farm by a nearby creek. He jumped in
his tractor without hesitation—and
here he is pictured—and he sought to
help the stranded motorists and the
volunteers who were there assisting.
When he got to the bridge that was
over the creek, water had started to
rush over it. The volunteers actually
were helping guide him across the
creek, and the bridge collapsed. Be-
cause he was in an enclosed cab, he
couldn’t escape.
Frantically, the family and others
helped search for him, and it wasn’t
until hours later that he was found a
long way back up the creek, but actu-
ally near his home, near his farm. It
was as though he was saying, ‘‘It’s
okay. I am back.’’
I wrote a letter to President Trump
recently asking the President to
present Mr. James Wilke the Presi-
dential Citizen’s Medal, and, Madam
Speaker, I would just like to read the
letter that I wrote to the President:
‘‘Dear Mr. President,
‘‘It is my honor to nominate Mr.
James Wilke of Columbus, Nebraska,
for the Presidential Citizen’s Medal.
The Nation’s second highest civilian
award recognizes persons who have per-
formed exemplary deeds or services for
their country or fellow citizens.
‘‘A 50-year-old Platte County farmer,
Mr. Wilke is rightly being heralded as
a hero by family, friends, and citizens
across the Cornhusker State and the
Nation. A husband, father, grandfather,
and community leader, James lived to
help others. He died attempting to res-
cue those in need during the cata-
strophic floods that hit Nebraska in
mid-March.
‘‘It surprised no one when, on March
14, James immediately responded to a
call from volunteer first responders to
help rescue a motorist stranded in the
rising floodwaters of Knox Creek near
his home. He didn’t hesitate. After re-
ceiving the call, Wilke jumped into his
John Deere 8100 tractor and headed
north on Monastery Road, a route he
had taken thousands of times before.
‘‘As James approached the scene of
the stranded motorist, he was con-
fronted by raging water over the bridge
that he needed to cross. Emergency re-
sponders already on the site tried to
guide James and the tractor over the
bridge, when it suddenly collapsed. The
tractor plunged into the water with
James inside.
‘‘James perished in the accident.
After a desperate search by neighbors,
family, and friends, Wilke’s body was
recovered downstream 9 hours later on
a creek bed near his own farm.
‘‘ ‘He was generous with his time and
giving,’ said a friend. ‘. . . the kind of
person that people don’t think exist
anymore. He would help anybody.’
‘‘A friend of Mr. Wilke posted this
tribute on social media. ‘James was
not only a great all-around guy; he was
a great family man and he was amaz-
ingly strong in his faith. . . . A true
hero who wore a T-shirt, blue jeans,
work boots, and drove a John Deere
tractor.’
‘‘An online petition has been
launched to get James Wilke the pres-
tigious Presidential Citizen’s Medal.
One online commentator wrote: ‘While
I don’t know this man personally, he
represents what Nebraska is all about:
hard work and willingness to help, no
matter the cost. To be a Nebraskan
means, within your own hardships, you
still give your all to help a complete
stranger in need. It means coming to-
gether to help our neighbors two to
three towns over because they have
lost everything. James represents a Ne-
braskan, doing all that and more, by
going above and beyond the call of ci-
vilian duty and paying the ultimate
sacrifice. He shows the Nation that we
can put aside our selfishness and our
pride to help someone else.’
‘‘Mr. President, I second these senti-
ments. I strongly support granting the
Presidential Citizen’s Medal to James
Wilke, a good man, simply doing his
duty, moved by courage, and motivated
by love to help another.
‘‘Thank you for your consideration.
‘‘Sincerely, Jeff Fortenberry.’’
Something that is not mentioned in
this letter is that the online petition to
the President for James has reached
tens of thousands of people, ordinary
people hearing about it and simply
wanting to do something to commend
this finest example out of what has
really been an attribute of the char-
acter of our State, neighbor helping
neighbor, and this neighbor giving the
ultimate sacrifice.
IN HONOR OF CHIEF STANDING BEAR
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, I would like to turn my attention to
an opportunity I had this morning be-
fore the Natural Resources Committee
to actually talk about another Nebras-
kan who lived long ago, a Nebraskan
who will soon adorn the Halls here. His
statue will be placed in Statuary Hall
right outside of these Halls. He was
Ponca Chief Standing Bear.
I was pleased to welcome Ms. Judi
Gaiashkibos, the director of the Ne-
braska Indian Commission, who, with
me, petitioned the Natural Resources
Committee to begin a process by which
we study the feasibility of a trail in
Standing Bear’s honor and in honor of
the Ponca people and the hardships
which they endured.
I began before the committee this
morning with these words:
No be-t e wiuga-the eo kigo zhi: Our
hands are not the same color.
These were the words of Chief Stand-
ing Bear as he was on trial in 1879.
And what was he accused of in that
courtroom in Omaha? He was accused
of leaving his reservation to bury his
dead son on the Ponca homeland near
Niobrara, Nebraska.
Even though there were treaties with
this Tribe, the Ponca had been force-
fully relocated from Nebraska to Okla-
homa. Along the way, his young daugh-
ter died. His son, suffering from the ill
effects of this, later was very ill, and
Chief Standing Bear promised him on
his deathbed that he would bury him
back in his homeland.
So, leading a group of Ponca in a
very tough winter of 1878, they began
the trek back to Nebraska, and he was
arrested. And through a series of
things, ended up in court, and this is
what he had to say:
No be-t e wiuga-the eo kigo zhi: Our
hands are not the same color. If I
pierce mine, I will feel pain. If you
pierce your hand, you will feel pain.
When the blood flows, it will be the
same color.
Nu bthi. Wako da-ak a ekigo waxa: I
am a man. God made us the same.
These immortal words of the Ponca
chief so deeply impacted the pro-
ceedings that the Court ruled in his
favor and perhaps began a sea course of
change of the history of our country.
Because what did Chief Standing
Bear do? He expressed the inherent dig-
nity and rights of all people, regardless
of color or ethnicity. He convinced U.S.
District Court Judge Elmer Dundy in
such a convicting way, he convinced
the judge in an unprecedented move—
now, remember, Madam Speaker, this
is 1879, and this had been unprece-
dented. The judge ruled that ‘‘an In-
dian is a person.’’ An Indian is a person
within the meaning of habeas corpus.
And so Standing Bear had won his
right and the right of all Native Ameri-
cans to be recognized as persons under
the law.
Such a glaring injustice is almost un-
imaginable to us today in our time.
The Ponca chief had prevailed in one of
the most important civil rights court
cases in the history of our Nation.
And so, in Congress, we continue to
recognize Standing Bear’s remarkable
life and achievement on behalf of his
people; and, as I mentioned, Madam
Speaker, in a few short months, we an-
ticipate a ceremony here in Statuary
Hall where one statue of one Nebras-
kan will be replaced by another Ne-
braskan.
Each State legislature has the right
to determine who is going to be in the
Nation’s Capitol. Currently, we are rep-
resented by William Jennings Bryan, a
Member of Congress who held this con-
gressional seat long before me, a three-
time Presidential candidate who,
again, is right at the entryway of Stat-
uary Hall there.
He has held that revered spot for
many, many years; and yet, as we
think creatively and imaginatively, as
history moves forward, we think about
other Nebraskans and other Americans
whom we can appropriately honor. So

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4114 May 22, 2019
the legislature has determined that
Chief Standing Bear ought to now
stand in the place of honor for Nebras-
kans and for all Americans, with a par-
ticularly special focal point for hon-
oring the first Americans, the indige-
nous people, the Native Americans. So
we look forward to that ceremony com-
ing soon.
But I reintroduced a bill, as well,
Madam Speaker, that directs the Sec-
retary of the Interior to begin a feasi-
bility study for the Chief Standing
Bear National Historic Trail, which
would basically trace the footsteps of
the Ponca Tribe along their forced re-
location.
Again, Madam Speaker, the
enshrinement of this trial into law
with a new statue in the United States
Capitol will set down a new marker for
the remembrance of this great civil
rights leader, a reminder of the ongo-
ing need for the protection of human
dignity and a celebration of the possi-
bility brought out by one man’s cour-
age.
Madam Speaker, as you are aware,
shortly, we will celebrate Memorial
Day, and in doing so, we honor those
who gave their last full measure in
service to our country. We appro-
priately stop the busyness and pause to
observe, to reflect, to remember.
The formal remembrance of our Na-
tion’s war dead is more than a nos-
talgic tradition. That a person would
lay down his life for his friends, for an-
other, demands that we turn our
thoughts to the noblest of human
ideals. When we gather together in
community, when we gather together
to simply say ‘‘thank you’’ and ‘‘re-
member,’’ we affirm our common bonds
as a people.
Now, it is not uncommon for any
Member of this body to reflect publicly
on the divisiveness, the anger, the re-
sentment, the seeming inability to re-
solve conflicts and problems in a con-
structive, reasoned fashion that is
fought out in this body, and, unfortu-
nately, is exploited by the media,
which profits off of this drama daily.
b 1800
This is why Memorial Day and other
reflective holidays are so important to
us as a people: of course, to remember
our war dead, but also to affirm the
common bonds that unite.
Before an international gathering of
public officials that I attended, some-
one posed a question. It is a probing
question. They simply asked this:
Where would you like to live, where
people lie, steal, and kill, or where peo-
ple are good, trustworthy, and free?
And when we consider the full arc of
human history, it is often marked by
fighting and dying and war. Each gen-
eration must face the agonizing and
harsh prospect that twisted ideology,
egomaniacal ambition, or the hunt for
glory will compel small minds to rape
and kill and pillage and crush the inno-
cent. Try as we might to create the
conditions for good will and mutual
support, sometimes good Americans
must step forward; they must volun-
teer to bravely protect the ideals that
we hold dear.
We are coming up on the 75th anni-
versary of D-day, June 6, 1944. There
will be a bilateral, two-country com-
memoration by both America and
France at Omaha Beach in France at
the cemetery there where near approxi-
mately 10,000 Americans lay at rest.
The night before D-day, the day be-
fore this famous photo of the Supreme
Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower
was taken—I happen to know President
Eisenhower’s granddaughter Susan,
and we were chatting one day about
this famous photo which occupies such
an extraordinary place in our history,
our folklore, our memory as a nation,
and she said: Jeff, do you know what
the President, the General, was speak-
ing about in that photo?
I had always made an assumption
that, again, these young men who are
getting ready to paratroop behind
enemy lines the day before D-day were
being given a last talk by the General
about the need for courage and persist-
ence, the need to think of what it
means to be in the face of a barbaric
aggressor, the need to fight hard and
solemnly, to obey orders and to take
care of their friends, the need to win
the day. That is what I would have
thought. That is what I would have
guessed.
Susan Eisenhower said: No. Do you
know what the General was speaking
about? Fly fishing and football.
Now, why would he do that at this
critical moment, this moment of ten-
sion and fear and adrenaline? Why
would he do that?
I think the better question is: Why
wouldn’t he do that? What more Amer-
ican thing could he do to remind these
young men, many of whom may have
given their life, of why they were doing
this? To remind them of what they
were tethered to: to home and hearth
and things like fishing and football
that represent the activities of commu-
nity, the liberties we enjoy, the memo-
ries from childhood, the peace and
tranquility that this country offers.
Fight for that.
I think that is what he was doing. So
I was very amazed and corrected, men-
tally, in my impression of this pivotal
moment, key moment in America’s
history.
A group of Members of Congress will
attend the 75th anniversary, and, of
course, the veterans who will be there
in attendance are quite old and will be
few in number. France will have some
awards for a few veterans as well.
And it is amazing in that part of the
world, the American flag flies over the
French municipal buildings there be-
cause the French in that part of Eu-
rope, they do not forget. They cele-
brate what America gave.
In fact, in August of 1944, Captain Lu-
ther Sexton Fortenberry, my grand-
father, left his wife and two children,
and he entered the war theater origi-
nally attached to a field hospital or to
a hospital unit in England.
He moved into the theater of war and
was killed in November of 1944 by an
explosion. He was killed near the town
of Sainte-Mere-Eglise, where some of
these paratroopers potentially landed.
There, the paratroopers landed in the
midst of a German column and had to
fight it out right in the town square.
To this day, a replica of one of our
paratroopers hangs on the church stee-
ple, demonstrating what happened to
him. He was actually caught on the
church steeple as he came down. He
survived the battle. The French there
very much commemorate and honor
what we gave.
My grandfather was initially buried
in the cemetery there at Sainte-Mere-
Eglise, but was later reinterred in Ar-
lington Cemetery here in Washington,
D.C., in 1948. This is how Omaha Ceme-
tery came to be.
All of the small cemeteries that were
set up during the course of the war as
things were moving so fast were con-
solidated in the various large ceme-
teries—again, Omaha Beach being one
of our more notable—and families were
given a choice: Do you want to leave
your loved one in Europe or would you
like to bring them home?
Because my own father died when I
was young, the direct memories of
what happened to my own grandfather
are a bit lost in the family tradition, so
I have had to do a lot of record search-
ing. I found out, though, that it was in-
teresting. In 1948, when my grandfather
was reinterred from this area of
France, Sainte-Mere-Eglise, his re-
mains were transported through the
Port of Cherbourg.
When I visited Omaha Beach Ceme-
tery, the French civilians who work for
us tending to the cemetery remem-
bering our war dead, telling the stories
of who they are, one young woman told
me that it was her grandfather who
started to work for the Americans in
burying our war dead and that he used
to work in the Port of Cherbourg pre-
paring the remains of our war dead to
come home. I thought to myself, what
an amazing confluence of history, that
maybe it was this young French wom-
an’s grandfather who prepared my
grandfather to be returned home.
So on the 75th anniversary, we will
again remember that great battle, that
turning point in the war in which so
many lives were lost and so many
young Americans came forward to say,
‘‘I will serve.’’
Memorial Day is a beautiful time of
remembrance, and communities all
across America will recognize this spe-
cial day. They will memorialize the
fallen heroes of battle who gave us the
chance to remain good, trustworthy,
and free. It is a precious moment where
we unite, where we are unified, where
we hold things in common in gratitude
for those who gave their life in service
to these ideals.
Beyond this special day, perhaps the
greatest memorial we can offer is to do

May 22, 2019
exactly what they did: to think in sac-
rificial terms about what is nobler and
higher, even in the midst of this body,
where we have to debate with intensity
the philosophical differences in order
to find, to construct, a reasoned way
forward for good public policy and the
good of all Americans.
Sometimes young people ask me:
How do you make a decision? It is a
great question. It is a beautiful ques-
tion, because they are wrestling with
how do you reconcile, as a representa-
tive of the people, what you may be-
lieve to be right with what the people
are saying.
Madam Speaker, I tell young people
that I walk through a threefold proc-
ess:
The first is let’s look at the evidence
here. What is the analysis, the statis-
tics, and what does other evidence say
about what might be the right pathway
here;
Second, let’s listen to the experts, or
those who are affected, potentially, by
this policy; and
Third is you must consult your con-
science, what you believe in your heart
of hearts.
Sometimes it is hard for young peo-
ple to reconcile this because sometimes
we have a misappropriation of the na-
ture of representative government. The
Representative, of course, is a reflec-
tion of the people who sent him there.
And what does he or she owe those
people? Right judgment, which means
hard work and intellectual discipline
around looking at the objective anal-
ysis of what can be determined as the
outcome of a particular policy.
Care, compassion, and fairness de-
mands that we listen to people who are
affected or who have expertise in the
policy.
But, ultimately, each one of us has to
consult their conscience, always, hope-
fully, rightfully formed, to make a
judgment about what is right, what is
good, what is just.
The beautiful gift of where I come
from is, even if people may disagree
and you give them an answer based
upon those three dynamics, they will
tell you they respect that. And that is
the core of our system. That is what
men and women continue to fight and
die for, this gift of America, this gift of
these ideals that somehow, with dis-
tinct differences and different back-
grounds, we find a way to harmonize
that which we ought to do—not just
what we can do, but what we ought to
do.
Systems are not perfect. They can be
messy and difficult. They can be ugly.
But I always believe that public service
is an honorable and high calling, and it
is only made possible by sacrifice,
sometimes the ultimate sacrifice by
those who have been willing to give
their all.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
WOMEN’S ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL
HEALTHCARE SERVICES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. PORTER) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
majority leader.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to discuss women’s access to es-
sential healthcare services.
I am the mother of three beautiful
children. When I gave birth to my first
child, to my second child, and to my
third child, I was given the time and
opportunity to plan for these preg-
nancies and welcome these children. I
was privileged enough to have the abil-
ity to make an informed decision to be-
come a mother at a time in my life
when I was ready to care for children.
Prior to having children, I had access
to birth control. I received healthcare
that helped me have three healthy
pregnancies and helped me to be able
to get pregnant when I was ready. But
too many women in this country don’t
have these choices.
Across the world, maternal mortality
rates are decreasing. Pregnancy and
birth are less dangerous across the
globe, but not in the United States.
While our country is a leader in so
many ways, we are failing our Nation’s
women by not delivering the care they
need during and after they give birth.
Too many women don’t have access
to prenatal and postnatal care. Too
many women already don’t have access
to birth control or abortion services,
and if we do not fight back, this crisis
is only going to get worse. If we do not
fight back, women are going to die.
The bills currently passing at the
State level will not stop abortion.
Overturning Roe v. Wade will not stop
abortion. These acts will only stop safe
abortion.
Research has found that every year
approximately 25.1 million women re-
ceive an unsafe abortion, and 68,000
women die annually of bleeding and in-
fection, almost entirely in countries
where abortion is illegal or inacces-
sible.
If we continue down this road,
women will die. The laws being passed
in Alabama, Missouri, and Georgia are
not pro-life. They are not protecting
the lives of women and families that
we were elected to serve.
Alabama has one of the highest ma-
ternal mortality rates in the country,
but instead of focusing on ensuring
that women have access to the
healthcare services they need when
they choose to have a pregnancy, the
State is choosing to punish those who
do not become mothers.
b 1815
Alabama State legislature has said
that they just simply don’t have the
funds to expand Medicaid to cover
more low-income women, families, and
other individuals. Yet they have the
millions of dollars necessary to fight a
legal battle to overturn Roe v. Wade.
These laws are anti-choice, anti-
women, and anti-life.
In the Alabama bill, the penalty for
aborting a pregnancy caused by rape is
higher than the penalty for raping a
woman. Let me say it again: in the
Alabama law, the penalty for aborting
a pregnancy caused by rape is higher
than the penalty for committing the
rape.
This is not the country we want to
be.
How is that upholding our values?
Let’s also note that women who have
a miscarriage—a tragic event—could be
criminally investigated to determine if
the miscarriage was related to an at-
tempted abortion or was otherwise
somehow the fault of the woman.
According to March of Dimes, 10 to 15
percent of pregnancies end in mis-
carriage. Most miscarriages happen in
the first trimester, before the 12th
week of pregnancy, but nearly 5 per-
cent of pregnancies that ended with
miscarriages happened in the second
trimester.
As a mother I cannot imagine the
pain of losing a child in the first, sec-
ond, or even third trimester. For those
who choose to get pregnant, this loss is
devastating. Imagine you and your
partner try for years to get pregnant.
You can’t afford expensive treatments
like IVF because they are not covered
under your insurance. You desperately
want to be a mother, but nothing
seems to be working. Finally, after 3
years, you take a home pregnancy test,
and you find out you are pregnant. A
short trip to the doctor confirms this
incredible and exciting news. You and
your partner are overjoyed. But 5
months later you start bleeding and
rush to the emergency room. More
than halfway through your pregnancy,
you have miscarried and will now have
to deliver a stillborn child. You and
your partner are heartbroken.
Imagine that a few days after this
tragic loss you find out that you and
your doctor are both being investigated
for attempting to abort the child whose
death you are still mourning.
This is cruel and inhumane. These
bills are not intended to stop abortion,
and they will not stop abortion. They
are not intended to save lives, and, in
fact, these bills will take lives.
This is the proof. If we really want to
reduce the number of abortions in this
country, we must ensure safe access to
women’s healthcare, including birth
control and comprehensive family
planning options.
I want women in Alabama, in Geor-
gia, in Missouri, and in every State
across the country that has passed or is
attempting to pass legislation to chal-
lenge Roe v. Wade to know that I stand
with them.
I want women in Orange County to
know that they elected someone who
will fight for their access to essential
healthcare services.
I want women in California and
across the country to trust that my
colleagues and I will fight for women

to have the healthcare and the respect
that they need and deserve regardless
of their income, race, or location.
Protecting women’s access to
healthcare is one of my top priorities,
and I will fight to ensure that every
woman has the access they need to live
a healthy life on their own terms.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR).
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to defy the horrifying attacks hap-
pening against women’s reproductive
rights all across this country.
Religious fundamentalists are cur-
rently trying to manipulate the State
laws in order to impose their beliefs on
an entire society, all with complete
disregard for voices and the rights of
American women.
The recent efforts like those in Ala-
bama and Georgia are only the latest
in a long history of efforts to crim-
inalize women for simply existing and
to punish us when we don’t conform to
their attempts to control us. And a new
proposal in Texas would go as far as to
threaten women who obtain an abor-
tion with capital punishment.
If that were being proposed by any
other country, we would be calling it a
dangerous violation of human rights.
But because it is happening here with
the support of the ultraconservative re-
ligious right, we call it religious free-
dom. It is simply unthinkable.
But this anti-choice movement isn’t
only unjust, it is dangerous because
history has proven that when abortion
is criminalized, the number of abor-
tions do not simply go down. The num-
ber of deaths and injuries to women in-
crease.
Let’s just be honest. For the reli-
gious right, this isn’t simply about
their care or concern for life. If they
cared about or were concerned about
children, then they would be concerned
about the children who are being de-
tained and those who are dying in
camps across our borders or the chil-
dren who are languishing in hunger and
facing homelessness.
This isn’t about religious morality or
conviction, because we have seen time
and time again those who talk about
their faith and want to push policies
because of their faith are the ones who
simply are caught with the hypocrisy
of not living it out in their personal
lives.
I just remember recently, not too
long ago, a Republican Congressman
who had to retire, Tim Murphy, be-
cause he asked his mistress to abort
their baby while pushing for a ban on
abortion. Or I remember the anti-
LGBT rights Republican, Larry Craig,
who was found soliciting sex in a bath-
room in a Minneapolis airport.
I am frustrated every single time I
hear people speaking about their faith
and pushing that on to other people,
because we know those so-called reli-
gious politicians, when it comes to
their life and their choices, they want
to talk about freedom, but when it
comes to other people’s lives and other
people’s choices, then they want to
talk about religion.
I feel that we must point out how
ironic it is that women now are facing
these challenges to their freedom in
the week that we are marking the
100th anniversary of the 19th Amend-
ment.
How can it be that an entire century
has passed, and we are still forced to
fight for our rights as women, as
human beings, and as Americans?
This should outrage every single per-
son. It certainly outrages me, and we
can no longer stand for it.
So today I ask every woman in this
country no matter her age, her race, or
her political affiliation to stand with
me—to stand with us—to stand up and
tell those who challenge our voice, our
place, and our right to decide for our-
selves to not be silent, to speak up and
to reclaim their right to choose.
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Representative OMAR for her remarks,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-

Let us pray.
Our Father in Heaven, supply the

new insights for the good of our Nation

fresh strength so they will not become
weary in doing what is right. Give
them the long view of their work. In-

Strengthen them this day with the

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized.
f
S. 1541
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on Monday, I introduced legislation to
raise the national minimum age for
purchasing tobacco products from 18 to
21. I walked through the long history of
our Nation’s complicated relationship
with this major cash crop. I laid out
the challenges facing tobacco farmers
in Kentucky and in other States and
the new opportunities some of them
are actually turning to. I explained
why, as we see signs of a new public
health crisis of nicotine addiction in
the younger generation, now is the
time to take decisive new action.
Together with Senator TIM KAINE,
who represents another State with a
very long history of tobacco produc-
tion, I was proud to introduce the bill
that builds on the existing structure
that is already in place and simply
raises the minimum age to 21. Rather
than reinvent the wheel here in Wash-
ington, it would set one national stand-
ard for enforcing new age-21 restric-
tions. It is a bill designed with States
in mind, and it would allow States to
take measures even more restrictive
than Federal law if they choose.
Senator KAINE and I have been grate-
ful to see—already, even in just the
past few days—substantial support and
recognition from public health advo-
cates that our approach is the right
way to address this pressing issue.
Already, our legislation has earned
the support of leading voices like the
American Cancer Society, the Amer-
ican Academy of Pediatrics, the Amer-
ican College of Cardiology, the Amer-
ican Heart Association, the American
Lung Association, the American Osteo-
pathic Association, the National Asso-
ciation of Secondary School Principals,
the Foundation for a Healthy Ken-
tucky, the Kentucky Hospital and Med-
ical Associations, and many others.
Here are just a few things these sup-
porters of our bill had to say:
One advocate called it a ‘‘critical
step forward that will profoundly im-
prove the health of our children and fu-
ture generations.’’
Another stated our legislation ‘‘will
be instrumental in stemming the epi-
demic of vaping that is afflicting chil-
dren as young as middle school.’’
Yet another said our bill could poten-
tially ‘‘save hundreds of thousands of
lives.’’
This should be an area where we all
lock arms to get results. I am proud
this body will have a chance to take
action and stem the tide of addiction
among our Nation’s youth. I am proud
to be standing with Senator KAINE. I
hope each of our colleagues will recog-
nize the opportunity before us, avoid
making this important issue any kind
of partisan football, and join in sup-
porting the Tobacco-Free Youth Act.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
since President Trump took office in
2017, the Senate has confirmed 41 well-
qualified individuals to serve on our
Nation’s circuit courts. No. 41 was Dan-
iel Collins of California, whom we con-
firmed yesterday to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals. As I have noted al-
ready, Mr. Collins came before the Sen-
ate with every conceivable indicator of
a brilliant legal mind and an impec-
cable professional record. I was proud
that the full Senate followed up

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3018 May 22, 2019
the Judiciary Committee’s favorable
report with a majority vote here on the
floor.
But our work this week is just begin-
ning. Yesterday, the Senate also ad-
vanced four more nominees—these to
serve on district courts across the
country. Today, we will vote to con-
firm all four.
The first, Howard Nielson, has been
nominated for the District of Utah. As
I mentioned yesterday, Mr. Nielson has
clerked for both the Fourth Circuit and
the Supreme Court and has assembled
an impressive record at the Depart-
ment of Justice and in the private sec-
tor.
Next will come the nomination of
Stephen Clark for the Eastern District
of Missouri. Mr. Clark is an accom-
plished litigator with nearly three dec-
ades of experience in practice.
The third nominee is Carl Nichols,
the President’s choice to serve as dis-
trict judge for the District of Colum-
bia. You will start to detect a pattern
because he, too, is a thoroughly im-
pressive nominee—clerkships for the
DC Circuit and for the Supreme Court
for Justice Thomas, service at the De-
partment of Justice, and recognized ex-
cellence in private practice.
Finally, we will vote on Kenneth
Bell, nominated to serve in the West-
ern District of North Carolina. Mr. Bell
has under his belt nearly two decades
of service in the Office of the U.S. At-
torney—distinguished by national hon-
ors for his accomplishments as a pros-
ecutor—as well as extensive experience
in the private sector.
So if I am sounding like a broken
record, it is because the White House
continues to submit one extremely
well-qualified and highly impressive
nominee after another to sit on the
Federal bench. These are men and
women who are bright, talented, well-
regarded, and committed to applying
what the text of our laws and our Con-
stitution actually say.
Today, we can take four more steps
in that positive direction. These nomi-
nees deserve big bipartisan votes, so I
hope each of my colleagues will join
me in voting to confirm each of them.
f
DISASTER RELIEF
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
now on one final matter, several of our
Senate colleagues and their counter-
parts in the House are continuing to
zero in on long-overdue legislation to
deliver additional help to Americans
all across the Nation who are strug-
gling to rebuild from natural disasters.
This ought to have been a fairly
straightforward process. We shouldn’t
need to explain why the need for this
relief is urgent, but just for good meas-
ure, let’s remember the Americans who
are counting on us.
In California, last year’s string of
wildfires included the deadliest and
most destructive fire on record. It
killed 85 people and burned more than
150,000 acres.
In the Midwest earlier this year,
storm surges flooded whole swaths of
States and racked up millions of dol-
lars in damages. As one expert recently
put it, ‘‘We have points in Iowa and Il-
linois that have been in flood stage for
over 30 days’’—30 days—‘‘which hasn’t
occurred since we started keeping
records—and some of them go back 150
years.’’
Across the Southeast and gulf coasts,
recent hurricane seasons have left last-
ing scars. Hurricane Michael, which
swept across Florida into South Geor-
gia last October, has itself produced
nearly 150,000 insurance claims in Flor-
ida alone.
In Alabama, more tornadoes have al-
ready been recorded in 2019 than in all
of last year. One that touched down in
Lee County on March 3 left 23 people
dead.
Nearly 2 years after Hurricane Maria
tore across Puerto Rico, too many
storefronts are still shuttered, too
many homes still lack roofs, and power
remains too unreliable.
And the list goes on.
This is hardly the first time facts
like these have been laid out here on
the floor. In fact, this legislation has
already taken far too long—far too
long—to deliver. But now that we are
in the home stretch, it is past time to
put partisan politics aside, move past
any tangential questions, and secure a
final agreement that can become law;
that is, something that can both pass
the Democratic House and earn the
President’s signature soon. That is how
to make a law in this situation.
The Senate will vote on disaster re-
lief this week. The Members of this
body will not return home for Memo-
rial Day without taking further action
to help these struggling communities,
which, by the way, include a number of
military installations that need assist-
ance to recover and to rebuild.
It is my sincere hope that we will be
able to vote on a negotiated, bipar-
tisan, bicameral solution. That is how
we can get to an outcome. That is what
affected Americans deserve.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY
LEADER
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized.
f
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, it
has been a frightening 2 weeks for tens
of millions of Americans who support a
woman’s freedom to make her own
healthcare choices. Actually, if you be-
lieve the polls, there are hundreds of
millions of Americans in that category.
Republican legislators across the
country have passed some of the most
extreme restrictions on a woman’s
right to choose. With breathtaking
speed, they are trying to take us back-
ward, but they have already provoked a
fierce reaction among the American
people.
Just yesterday, I stood with hundreds
before the Supreme Court to speak on
behalf of Americans everywhere who
believe that women don’t deserve to be
treated this way by their government.
Meanwhile, here in the Senate, the Re-
publican leader is once again stalling—
it seems to be his MO—on a bill to im-
prove legal protections for women who
are victims of domestic abuse, assault,
and stalking. This is VAWA, or the Vi-
olence Against Women Act.
VAWA has been a landmark piece of
legislation, and it has greatly reduced
the abuse of women. Well, there was an
improved and expanded VAWA that
was passed by the House of Representa-
tives on a bipartisan basis. It got sig-
nificant Republican votes. It brings
much needed updates to existing Fed-
eral law. It finally expands protections
to women who are victims of violence
from domestic partners or former part-
ners, not just current or former
spouses. It also says that if you are
known to stalk your partner or have a
restraining order against you, you
shouldn’t be allowed to purchase a gun.
Thanks to the work of some of my col-
leagues in both Chambers, it also
brings renewed attention to violence
against Native American women who
are so often overlooked.
I thank Senators SMITH, KLOBUCHAR,
and CANTWELL for bringing attention
to this bill later today.
Unfortunately, Leader MCCONNELL
has indicated that he will not bring the
House-passed VAWA bill to the floor,
despite these many commonsense re-
forms. Why not? I hope it is not be-
cause the gun lobby reflexively opposes
any restrictions on gun purchases—
even for convicted stalkers. I hope that
is not the impediment here, because as
Senator KLOBUCHAR has pointed out, if
you are abused by your husband, then,
you are protected by VAWA. If you are
abused by a boyfriend, you are not.
What is the difference? What is the dif-
ference?
VAWA is yet another example of how
Leader MCCONNELL has turned this
Chamber into a legislative graveyard.
Even the most commonsense bills, with
broad support from one end of America
to the other, that are passed by the
House—here, a bill protecting women
from violence—meet the grim fate at
the hands of the Senate’s self-pro-
claimed Grim Reaper.
What a shame. The Violence Against
Women Act is precisely the kind of leg-
islation the American people expect
the Senate to consider. During a dif-
ficult few weeks for women across

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3019
May 22, 2019
America, the Senate could have sent a
strong, positive signal by moving for-
ward on the Violence Against Women
Act. Instead, Leader MCCONNELL
carved out another tombstone for his
legislative graveyard—another popular
bipartisan bill buried with no action by
the Senate and tied by the leader in
partisan gridlock.
f
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
earlier this month, a report from Ha-
waii’s Mauna Loa Observatory found
that carbon dioxide levels in our at-
mosphere have now reached the highest
level in human history—in human his-
tory. It was a chilling reminder that
the threat from climate change is real,
immediate, and existential. Almost ev-
eryone accepts this science and the
gravity of the threat it portends. The
only group of folks that still seem
skeptical of climate science are Repub-
licans and the Trump administration.
Yesterday the New York Times re-
ported that the Trump EPA is planning
to rewrite the established benchmarks
for unsafe levels of air pollution. You
heard that right. They are planning to
use dubious math to obscure the real
and long-known health risks of air pol-
lution. These new formulations would
result in fewer predicted deaths than
what the experts have long agreed to.
People will still die. The numbers will
just be wrong about the effect.
Why, might you ask, would anyone
want to obscure the full health risks of
air pollution? Because then the Trump
administration could use the fake
math to justify further rollbacks to
clean air rules at a time when global
warming is increasing and when Ameri-
cans know the danger. This Trump ad-
ministration and the Republican ma-
jority are rolling the clock back—more
carbon, more coal, more oil, and more
gas, when we need less. We all know
that.
What kind of Orwellian nonsense is
this? The Environmental Protection
Agency making it easier to pollute the
environment? It is a textbook defini-
tion of ‘‘dystopian.’’
As my colleague Senator WHITEHOUSE
so often points out, dark money lurks
behind so much of what the Trump ad-
ministration does. Big Oil, Big Gas,
and big polluters everywhere are the
only possible boosters of this decision.
It is their money, funneled to political
organizations and politicians without a
trace of disclosure, that motivates
folks in the Trump administration to
make it easier to release more pollu-
tion into the air.
We should be using the Senate to de-
bate climate policies in search of com-
mon ground, but Leader MCCONNELL
has decided to bring forward his
version of the Green New Deal just so
his party could vote against it. We
know what Leader MCCONNELL and the
Republicans are against. What are they
for in dealing with climate change? So
far, nada, zero, nothing—they haven’t
put a single thing on the floor. The
American people see the effects of cli-
mate change in their lives, and they
know Congress must act. Only the Re-
publican majority stands in the way.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

MEMORIAL DAY
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Monday
is Memorial Day. It is the day our Na-
tion pauses to remember all those who
laid down their lives in defense of our
country, from Saratoga to Yorktown,
to Iraq and Afghanistan.
We enjoy tremendous freedoms as
Americans, tremendous privileges, but
we do not enjoy these privileges by
chance. They are hard-fought gains se-
cured for us again and again by each
new generation of American soldiers
who lay down their lives in the cause of
the free. It is important that we do not
take what they have secured for us
lightly, that we remember our free-
doms have been paid for in blood.
Near the end of the film ‘‘Saving Pri-
vate Ryan,’’ the dying Captain Miller
tells Private Ryan of the sacrifice that
has been made on his behalf. He says:
‘‘Earn this . . . earn it.’’
I am not sure we can ever fully earn
the gift that has been given to us by
those who have laid down their lives in
our defense, but we can attempt to live
lives worthy of their sacrifice and to
defend the cause for which they gave
the last full measure of devotion.
When we remember the fallen on Me-
morial Day, there is one other group
we should remember, and that is their
families. Our Nation’s Gold Star fami-
lies may not have laid down their own
lives for our country, but they gave
their loved ones, their fathers and
brothers, daughters and sisters. For the
sake of our freedoms, they live with
empty spaces at Thanksgivings and
birthdays, at weddings and gradua-
tions, at their dinner tables and Little
League practices. We owe them a debt
also that we can never repay.
I have been privileged to visit more
than one veterans cemetery, such as
our own Black Hills National Cemetery
in South Dakota—which we recently
expanded to ensure that our soldiers
will have a resting place for genera-
tions to come—Arlington National
Cemetery, and the American Cemetery
at Normandy. There is a special
hallowedness to the ground at these
places. Valor and sacrifice still linger
in the air, and a deep peace abounds—
the peace of the warrior who has
fought the good fight and found rest
from his labors.
General George S. Patton once said:
It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men
who died. Rather, we should thank God that
such men lived.
I might disagree with General Patton
on the first part, as it is right and
proper that we should mourn our dead,
but with General Patton, I say: Let us

HEALTHCARE
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I
come to the floor again today to dis-
cuss Washington Democrats’ one-size-
fits-all healthcare scheme. Every
American needs to know about this
very radical plan.
Democrats essentially want Wash-
ington, DC, to take over all of
healthcare in this country and to abol-
ish private health insurance that 180
million Americans get through their
jobs. Incredibly, this proposal offered
by Senator BERNIE SANDERS has the
backing of many leading Democrats
running for President and 109 Demo-
cratic Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
So I want to continue the debate
today by focusing on the terrible im-
pact this radical scheme will have on
all of the fine men and women who pro-
vide healthcare to people across the
country. Of course, the impact on them
will impact the patients for whom they
provide care and services.
I am talking about the Nation’s dedi-
cated medical professionals, especially

those who serve in our community hos-
pitals. I actually know many of these
healthcare providers because I am one
of them. For many years I practiced or-
thopedic surgery in Casper, WY. I was
a medical doctor, a physician, and
chief of staff at the Wyoming Medical
Center.
When practicing medicine in Casper,
WY—or anywhere in the Presiding Offi-
cer’s home State of Nebraska—you
really treat patients from all over the
State. That is because many people in
Wyoming live in small towns. I am
talking about patients in towns like
my wife’s hometown of Thermopolis,
WY. My wife’s parents are there. When
they need specialty care, they go to
Casper. For those who haven’t traveled
in Wyoming, it is about a 2-hour drive
one way when the weather is good.
My point is, when you work in the
Casper hospital, you are actually cov-
ering a large area in our State, and
that is often the case in many States.
So when I hear that Washington Demo-
crats want to have a one-size-fits-all
healthcare plan, I wonder if they have
given any thought to people in the Na-
tion’s heartland, to people out west.
Are they considering people in rural
communities at all?
I will state that I think about the
people of Wyoming every day. I am
there every week. The staff at small
hospitals who serve rural communities
like Thermopolis, Rawlins, Lusk,
Kemmerer, and at the Lovell hospital,
where I attended a health fair this past
Saturday, talking to all of the folks
there—their needs are things I am not
convinced Washington Democrats have
any knowledge of or care for at all. The
people at these hospitals work hard
just to keep the doors open so that
they can continue to care for patients
right there.
So alarm bells go off when I see head-
lines like the one from the Washington
Post that said:
‘‘Who’s going to take care of these peo-
ple?’’ As emergencies rise across rural Amer-
ica, a hospital fights for its life.
That is the headline in the Wash-
ington Post, referring to a community
hospital in Osage County, OK. The hos-
pital has a sign out front that reads:
‘‘A small community is only as healthy
as its hospital.’’ That is the truth.
Hospitals across rural America are
struggling. Many are, in fact, fighting
for their lives. Still, Democrats are of-
fering a plan that will destroy private
health insurance in America, which is
the lifeblood of our Nation’s healthcare
system; 180 million Americans get
their insurance this way.
Democrats want to drastically reduce
provider payments which, of course,
would drive many doctors from prac-
tice and shutter many small hospitals.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services Administrator has said a one-
size-fits-all system ‘‘would decimate
physician networks, creating a perma-
nent physician shortage.’’
So how can rural hospitals survive
with no financial cushion if Democrats’
one-size-fits-all healthcare plan passes?
Just ask the New York Times, of all
people. Last month, the Times ran
with this headline: ‘‘Hospitals Stand to
Lose Billions Under ‘Medicare for
All.’ ’’ Hospitals stand to lose billions.
The Times cites a study from George
Mason University that found Medicare
provider reimbursement rates are more
than 40 percent lower than private in-
surance rates—40 percent lower. At
these payment rates, the Times says,
‘‘[s]ome hospitals, especially strug-
gling rural centers,’’ like those in the
Presiding Officer’s home State and
mine ‘‘would close virtually over-
night.’’
There would be an overnight closure
of hospitals under BERNIE SANDERS’
and the Democrats’ one-size-fits-all
scheme for medicine in America.
I am sure a lot of people listening out
there are thinking, maybe it is all a
mistake; maybe Democrats don’t really
mean to threaten hospitals. Well, the
fact is, Democrats have long argued
that hospitals need to close. That is
what they have said.
Look at what Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel,
who is an architect of ObamaCare and
a professor in Philadelphia, said on the
subject. He actually wrote a book out-
lining all of this. It is titled, ‘‘Rein-
venting American Health Care.’’
He predicted that 1,000 U.S. hospitals
would close by 2020. Well, we are ap-
proaching that year. We haven’t closed
1,000 in this country, but over 80 have
closed, and those are rural hospitals.
Last year he published an op-ed in
the New York Times—the same Dr.
Emanuel—ominously titled, ‘‘Are Hos-
pitals Becoming Obsolete?’’ He writes:
Hospitals are disappearing. While they will
never completely go away, they will con-
tinue to shrink in number and importance.
This is inevitable and good.
Well, not in rural America—‘‘good,’’
he says, that thousands of hospitals
and patients who rely on them are
forced to close their doors for good. I
disagree fundamentally with this prin-
ciple and what he is saying.
Of course, all people who practice
medicine in small towns want to keep
the doors open because they know the
impact on the lives of the people who
live in those communities. Just last
week I had a chance to visit with Dr.
Mike Tracy, a family physician in Pow-
ell, WY. He is past president of the Wy-
oming Medical Society. He is pas-
sionate about caring for his patients,
and guess what. He doesn’t participate
in Medicare at all. Instead, he provides
his services privately by charging his
patients a set, transparent monthly
fee. He does what he does to keep his
practice open. His focus is on his pa-
tients, not on Washington paperwork,
and his patients are very happy. His
practice is successful. The patients are
happy with the time he is able to sit
and be with them and look at them and
focus on them, instead of the mandates
of a Washington computer screen.
So you see, there are doctors like
Mike all across the country who don’t
want a one-size-fits-all healthcare sys-
tem. Many doctors and many small
community hospitals cannot afford it,
and they will not survive it. Certainly,
many rural communities can’t survive
it.
As the Presiding Officer knows better
than most, as he has traveled his State
and as I have traveled mine, if a small
community loses a hospital, it is hard-
er to attract doctors, nurses, teachers,
businesses—all of the things that are
vital for a community to have. So the
threat is very real in terms of what the
Democrats and what BERNIE SANDERS
and the one-size-fits-all healthcare
plan would bring to our country.
Let me just tell people who are
watching the debate right now: Demo-
crats’ one-size-fits-all healthcare—
what this will mean for you is that you
will pay more to wait longer for worse
care. That is what it means. That is
what it means to you. You will pay
more to wait longer for worse care.
That is what is at stake.
We all need to make our voices heard
loud and clear: no to Democrats’ one-
size-fits-all healthcare scheme, yes to
real reforms that improve healthcare
and bring down the costs for all Ameri-
cans.
I yield the floor.

ENERGY INNOVATION
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it seems
a bit surreal but necessary, nonethe-
less, to come here to the Senate floor
to talk about the perils of socialism
and its sudden resurgence within the
Democratic Party.
We have seen our Democratic friends
push for policies like Medicare for All,
which would completely wreck the sys-
tem that provides healthcare for our
seniors and force all Americans onto
the same plan, regardless of the fact
that they never paid anything into it,
like our seniors have, and regardless of
the fact that they may indeed like
their private health insurance that
they get from their employers.
Do you remember when the Obama
administration promised in 2013, ‘‘If
you like your plan, you can keep it’’?
Well, I don’t really think they meant
it, but that is at least what they said.
Democrats have gotten so much more
radical today that their motto should
be, ‘‘If you like your plan, you can’t
keep it under Medicare for All.’’
They have also promised things like
free college—and, believe me, ‘‘free’’ is
popular, especially if you don’t think
you are ever going to have to end up
paying for it—promising anyone and
everyone that they can go to college
for free.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3021
May 22, 2019
Now, there are some smart things we
can do to help prepare high school stu-
dents and college students to hold
down their debt and to make sure that
they get the sort of advice and coun-
seling they need to make sure they are
studying something that is going to be
able to provide them an income with
which they can repay the loans that
they take out, and there is some work
we need to do in that area.
Across Texas, I have had a chance re-
cently to go to a number of middle
schools and high schools, and in
Texas—and I am sure we are not
alone—there are many high schools
where students can get dual credit, col-
lege and high school credit, and some
of them graduate from high school
with essentially 2 years of college be-
hind them, and it costs them nothing.
It is free. I guess that is free. Actually,
it is not free, either, but they don’t
have to pay anything more for it, and
their parents don’t have to pay any-
thing more for their property or sales
tax for it.
So that is a smarter way to approach
this, rather than this radical idea that
things like college can somehow be
free, knowing that, actually, there will
be somebody that pays for it, whether
it is our children, when they grow up
and they have to pay back the money
that we have recklessly borrowed in
our deficits and debt, or by raising
taxes, and you can’t raise taxes enough
on the rich people in order to pay for
this. So, inevitably, that burden will
fall on the middle class.
To put the icing on the cake on these
radical policies, you have to look at
this Green New Deal proposal that the
Democrats have rolled out and really
call this the icing on the cake in their
socialist proposals.
They want to take over the entire en-
ergy sector of the economy, and they
want to regulate it, and they want to
tax it in such a way as to promise
somehow something that is never going
to be realized.
For example, they say they want to
achieve net zero emissions in 10 years.
Well, Texas, Oklahoma, and other
States generate a lot of electricity
from renewable sources, particularly
wind-generated energy, but there is no
way in the world you are going to be
able to eliminate things like natural
gas and other sources of energy be-
cause the wind doesn’t always blow and
the Sun doesn’t always shine. So you
are going to need something to provide
the baseload when the wind is not
blowing and the Sun is not shining.
This pie-in-the-sky idea of net zero
emissions in 10 years by going entirely
to renewables is simply fantasy.
They also want to overhaul our
transportation system. They want to
rebuild and retrofit every single build-
ing in the country, but they offer no
real details, and, in fact, I think there
is a reason for that, because they don’t
even talk about the details of what
needs to be accomplished or the cost
there would be associated with trying
to accomplish it.
The only estimate I have seen is a $93
trillion price tag, but that is an impor-
tant piece of information that you
would think the public would have a
right to know, and that is not some-
thing the advocates of the Green New
Deal have been particularly proud of.
Even if this is something a majority
of Americans want, we don’t currently
have the technology or the resources to
make it happen. Our Democratic
friends know that. So they are, in es-
sence, making a promise for something
that they can’t deliver because of the
price and because the technology has
not yet been invented.
So what was really bizarre here on
the Senate floor was that when the ma-
jority leader provided our Democratic
colleagues a chance to vote on this res-
olution on the Senate floor, not a sin-
gle Democratic colleague voted for it.
They voted ‘‘present.’’
Well, that is a new one on me. I
thought when we came here to the Sen-
ate, our job was to represent our con-
stituents and vote yes or no on legisla-
tion. To show up and vote ‘‘present’’
seems to me like an abdication of that
responsibility, but it also is some evi-
dence of how really cynical and insin-
cere this proposal really is.
That is not to say that it isn’t pop-
ular when you start offering free things
and you start promising things that
are unaffordable or unattainable.
Instead of talking about these poli-
cies that are unwanted, unachievable,
and unaffordable, let’s talk about some
real solutions. I think that is the re-
sponsibility of people like me who say
the Green New Deal will not cut it, to
which people might ask: Well, what are
your suggestions? And I think that is
an important and fair question.
No matter what your perspective on
energy issues and the environment, I
think every single one of us can agree
on at least one point: We need smart
energy policies that will strengthen
our economy without bankrupting
American families.
I would just note, parenthetically,
that we have actually made some pret-
ty good progress when it comes to
emissions control. Between 1970 and
2017, combined U.S. emissions of six
criteria air pollutants have gone down
73 percent. During that same period of
time, the American economy grew by
262 percent, the number of vehicle
miles traveled grew 189 percent, and
our population grew 59 percent. We
were able to reduce pollutants by 73
percent at a time when the population
was growing, people were driving more,
and our economy was growing.
More recently, between 1990 and 2017,
the United States reduced sulfur diox-
ide concentrations by 88 percent, lead
by 80 percent, nitrogen dioxide by 50
percent, particulate matter by 40 per-
cent, ground-level ozone by 22 percent,
and carbon monoxide by 77 percent.
From 2005 to 2017, carbon dioxide
emissions declined nearly 15 percent in
the United States. During that same
period of time—and this is a fair com-
parison—China’s annual carbon dioxide
emissions have increased roughly by
double—twice what they were during
the same time period.
So I would say that we can blame
America first for all sorts of problems.
I don’t think that is fair, nor is it accu-
rate, and, particularly, when you start
talking about the environment and
controlling ozone-depleting CO2 emis-
sions. I think there is a better way to
approach it, and we need to start with
the facts.
I think the facts are that we need to
form partnerships to leverage the capa-
bilities of the private sector and
achieve cost-effective solutions. None
of the people advocating the Green New
Deal can really tell you how much you
would be paying for electricity if we
were able to implement the Green New
Deal, how much you would have to pay
for your transportation costs, or how
much you would have to pay to heat or
cool your house. We need policies that
make sense, that are affordable and
achievable, and that will actually bring
down the cost of each of those items
for the American people.
The solution isn’t a $100 trillion
Green New Deal; it is good old-fash-
ioned, all-American innovation. By
incentivizing research into the devel-
opment of new technologies, we can
keep costs low for taxpayers, while se-
curing our place as a global leader in
energy innovation. One great example
of the type of solution I am suggesting
you could learn about by taking a trip
to the NET Power plant in La Porte,
TX, right outside of Houston, which I
did recently. NET Power has developed
a first-of-its-kind power system that
generates affordable, zero-emissions
electricity using their unique carbon
capture technology. They have taken
natural gas—one of the most prevalent
and affordable energy sources that
there is—and they have made it emis-
sion-free. This is a shining example of
the environmentally and fiscally re-
sponsible policies we should be advo-
cating and supporting.
Last year, renewables accounted for
only 17 percent of our total energy
sources. That includes hydropower,
wind, solar, biomass, and various other
sources. Seventeen percent. Natural
gas already accounts for more than
double that. So if we could take this
incredibly common and affordable en-
ergy source and make it more environ-
mentally friendly, why wouldn’t we do
that? Why wouldn’t that be a more sen-
sible, fiscally responsible way of ad-
dressing this?
These policies are important for con-
servation but also for securing our
competitiveness on the world stage. If
American companies don’t produce
these technologies first, well, you bet
somebody else will.
The heavyhanded government ap-
proaches we are seeing from our Demo-
cratic colleagues are not the answer.
Instead, we have to harness the power
of the private sector and build partner-
ships to drive real solutions.

S3022 May 22, 2019
Yes, we need to invest in innovative
solutions and encourage the private
sector to continue prioritizing reliable,
affordable, and environmentally sound
energy sources.
When you implement government
policies that get government out of the
way and let the experts do their jobs,
you can be pro-energy, pro-innovation,
pro-growth, and pro-environment. I
will soon be introducing some legisla-
tion that I think will help us move
down that road. We know the United
States leads the world in emissions re-
duction, and this bill will build on that
success without a one-size-fits-all man-
date that would bankrupt our country.
DEBBIE SMITH ACT
Mr. President, on another topic, as I
highlighted earlier this week, the Sen-
ate has unanimously passed the Debbie
Smith Act of 2019, which would provide
critical resources for law enforcement
to test rape kits, prosecute criminals,
and deliver justice for victims. This
was a major bipartisan achievement,
and I look forward to working with our
House colleagues to get this legislation
to the President’s desk as soon as pos-
sible.
But there is more we need to do to
assist victims of violence and sexual
assault. For example, today I am filing
the Help End Abusive Living Situa-
tions—or HEALS—Act, which will pro-
vide domestic violence survivors with
expanded access to transitional hous-
ing. This will help these victims per-
manently leave their abusers, rebuild
their lives, and begin a long-term heal-
ing process.
Even more pressing, folks on both
sides of the aisle agree that we need to
reauthorize and strengthen the Vio-
lence Against Women Act, also known
as VAWA. It is something I strongly
support and an issue our friend and col-
league Senator ERNST continues to
champion here in the Senate.
Republicans and Democrats say we
must do more to provide services for
victims of domestic violence and sex-
ual assault, and while we certainly had
some disagreements on the way to do
that, there is no question that VAWA
has traditionally been a bipartisan
commitment. That is why I was so
shocked earlier this year when House
Democrats blocked the Republican ef-
fort to reauthorize this critical law be-
fore it lapsed last February.
The current violence against women
law lapsed in February because House
Democrats refused to allow us to ex-
tend it. Why would they do that? If
they claim to be supportive of efforts
to protect women and others from vio-
lence and assault, why would they let
the very law that authorizes the var-
ious programs Congress has paid for in
the past—why would they let that
lapse? Well, sadly, this is where poli-
tics rears its ugly head.
We were seeking a short-term reau-
thorization of the existing Violence
Against Women Act so bipartisan nego-
tiations could continue on a long-term
update and extension of the law, but
House Democrats recklessly blocked
this reauthorization of VAWA because
they were seeking to add controversial
provisions that should never be a part
of a consensus bill—certainly not one
that enjoys broad bipartisan support.
In the face of this political jockeying
by House Democrats, I am proud to say
that the Appropriations Committee did
the right thing: It continued to fully
fund all Violence Against Women Act
programs through the remainder of
this fiscal year. So this means that
House Democrats, when they tried to
kill VAWA by refusing to reauthorize
it, actually failed to accomplish their
goal if their goal was to deny women
and other victims of violence the crit-
ical funding needed for these programs.
Despite the efforts they undertook to
let VAWA expire, critical domestic vio-
lence and sexual assault prevention
programs will continue to receive full
Federal funding until we can reach a
bipartisan consensus agreement and
update the law. So good for the Appro-
priations Committee for making that
happen, but my point is that VAWA
should never be used as a political
plaything or pawn.
I am somewhat encouraged by ongo-
ing, bipartisan negotiations here in the
Senate, and I commend Senator ERNST
for her commitment to this effort and
look forward to supporting a long-term
extension of VAWA that is done in the
right way—through negotiation and
agreement, not political gamesman-
ship. That is the wrong way to do
things. We know better—if people will
simply stop the political posturing and
political games and do the work the
American people sent us here to do.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am
here to discuss with my colleagues
issues dealing with the work of the
Senate Finance Committee and pos-
sible legislation that hopefully will
come up this summer to keep
healthcare costs down, particularly
prescription drugs.
In the process of doing that, I want
to set the record straight on an issue
that affects every American who is eli-
gible for Medicare. More specifically, I
am here to talk about efforts to reduce
the rising cost of prescription medi-
cine.
Prescription drugs save lives. Mil-
lions of Americans like myself wake up
every morning and take their daily
medication, but there is something
that has become a very tough pill to
swallow for an increasing number of
Americans, and that is paying for the
rising cost of prescription drugs.
I applaud President Trump for turn-
ing up the volume on this issue last
summer. That is when the President
announced his administration’s blue-
print to lower drug costs for all Ameri-
cans. He found out—and we all found
out—that is a goal that has widespread
support that includes Republicans and
Democrats, as well as urban and rural
Americans.
Of course, the President can only do
so much—whatever law passed by Con-
gress allows the President to do and
that doesn’t solve all the issues. So
even though I applaud the President,
that doesn’t mean I exclude in any way
the responsibility of Congress to take
action.
There are many good ideas to build
upon that share broad, bipartisan, bi-
cameral support. There is one policy,
however, that some Members are talk-
ing about that I don’t agree with, and
that is repealing what is the noninter-
ference clause in Medicare Part D. I
would like to explain why Congress
kept the government out of the busi-
ness of negotiating drug prices in the
Medicare program. Some 16 years ago,
when I was formerly chairman of the
Finance Committee, I was a principal
architect of the Medicare Part D pro-
gram.
For the first time ever, Congress, in
2003, added an outpatient prescription
drug benefit to the Medicare program.
Maybe I ought to explain for my col-
leagues why it took between 1965 and
2003 to include drug benefits in the
Medicare program. Remember, in 1965,
prescription drugs or drugs generally
didn’t play a very big role in the deliv-
ery of medicine like they do today, but
over time, they have become more im-
portant.
That is why great support at the
grassroots, both bipartisan and bi-
cameral, evolved into what we call the
Medicare Part D program, adopted in
that year, 2003. So we came to the con-
clusion that adding the prescription
drug benefits for seniors was the right
thing to do, but it needed to be done in
the right way—right for seniors and
right for the American taxpayers. By
that, I mean allowing the forces of free
enterprise and competition to drive
costs down and drive value up.
For the first time ever, Medicare re-
cipients in every State had the vol-
untary decision to choose a prescrip-
tion drug plan that fit their pocket-
books and their healthcare needs.
The Part D program has worked.
Beneficiary enrollment and satisfac-
tion are robust. The Part D market-
place offers consumers better choice,
better coverage, and better value; yet
here we are again. It has been 13 years
since Part D was implemented, and
once again, I am hearing the same calls
to put the government back into the
driver’s seat of making decisions on
what you can take in the way of pills
or what your doctor might be able to
prescribe to you based upon what a for-
mulary might be. We want the private
sector to decide the formulary, not the

government. So these people happen to
be the same backseat drivers who
think that centralized government
knows everything and knows best.
As the Senator who, once again,
chairs the committee with jurisdiction
over Medicare policy, I am not going to
let Congress unravel what is right
about Medicare Part D. Remember, I
was a Republican leading the charge to
add a new benefit to a government pro-
gram. A lot of people think that is very
uncharacteristic of a Republican, but I
told you why I did that: because medi-
cine was becoming an increasing part
of the delivery of quality healthcare.
So you heard me correctly, I was a Re-
publican chairman working with my
Democratic ranking member, Max Bau-
cus, to accomplish Part D. We nego-
tiated an agreement to add prescrip-
tion drug coverage for seniors.
For me and other Republicans—
namely President George W. Bush—
there were a few key caveats. First, it
must be voluntary. Second, bene-
ficiaries would share the cost with the
taxpayer because having skin in the
game keeps check on spending and on
utilization. Third, we must allow com-
petition—not government mandates—
to drive innovation, curb costs, expand
coverage, and improve outcomes. It
wouldn’t work if the Federal Govern-
ment interfered with delivery of medi-
cine and dictate which drugs would and
would not be covered. That is why we
wrote a noninterference clause in the
law.
My friend, Senator WYDEN, the cur-
rent Democratic ranking member of
the Finance Committee, voted for final
passage in 2003. By the way, we are
having very good bipartisan coopera-
tion in our Finance Committee on,
hopefully, legislation to be debated in
our committee in June in regard to
lowering drug costs.
The noninterference provision ex-
pressly prohibits Medicare from, one,
negotiating drug prices; two, setting
drug prices; and, three, establishing a
one-size-fits-all list of covered drugs.
That list is called a formulary. I re-
member that many of my friends on
the other side of the aisle voted for this
policy; yet some are now pushing for
repeal of that provision.
Here is a list of Democrat leaders
who supported and voted to ban Medi-
care from negotiating drug prices:
when he was in the Senate, Senator
Biden; Senator Kennedy; Senator Bau-
cus; Senator Reid, the former majority
leader; Senator SCHUMER now in the
Senate; LEAHY; DURBIN; STABENOW;
CANTWELL. On the other side of the
Capitol, the list included Speaker
PELOSI and chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, Chairman NEAL.
There is something else that I have
learned in all my years talking
healthcare policy with Iowans at my
annual 99 county meetings where I
enjoy a Q and A with whatever agenda
my constituents call upon me to dis-
cuss with them.
At the end of the day, Iowans don’t
want the government prescribing life-
saving medications. Iowans want to
make those decisions with a physician
who is treating them. Last year, 43
million out of 60 million Medicare re-
cipients were enrolled in the Medicare
Part D program. That is the vast ma-
jority of Medicare beneficiaries nation-
wide that don’t have coverage through
a past employer or similar coverage
from another source.
Plan sponsors design different plan
choices and compete for beneficiaries
based on what those plans cover and
what they cost. Beneficiaries can pick
from many options, with over 3,000
plans offered across 34 geographic
areas. In other words, you don’t have
one plan dictated by the government.
Most beneficiaries were covered by a
prescription drug plan, and a growing
number were covered by a Medicare ad-
vantage prescription drug plan.
The Part D base premium amount is
low and has remained stable over many
years. Looking back to our negotia-
tions in 2003 to get this bill to the
President of the United States, we
wondered how high these premiums
would go, and we were fearful they
would just go out of the atmosphere
and that they would not be stable like
they have been over a long period of
time. So the noninterference clause en-
sures that plan sponsors create plan
options that respond to what the bene-
ficiaries—not the government—says it
should be.
The nonpartisan congressional score-
keeper, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, has repeatedly stated that repeal-
ing this noninterference clause would
not save money, unless there was a re-
stricted formulary. As I stated, we
wrote this bill in 2003 so the govern-
ment wouldn’t get between you and
your doctor on what you ought to have
in the way of prescription drugs. So in
regard to the cost, I asked CBO to up-
date, and they did. CBO sent me a let-
ter stating the same thing.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the
May 10, 2019, letter from the CBO.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
U.S. SENATE,
COMMITTEE ON FINANCE,
Washington, DC, May 10, 2019.
KEITH HALL, Ph.D.,
Director, Congressional Budget Office,
U.S. Congress, Washington, DC.
DEAR DR. HALL: As an author of the Medi-
care Part D program enacted in the Medicare
Modernization Act of 2003, I support the stat-
utory provision that prohibits the Secretary
of the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) from interfering with nego-
tiations between drug manufacturers, phar-
macies, and plan sponsors. The Part D pro-
gram structure that uses private entities to
negotiate and compete to enroll beneficiaries
has worked. Program spending has been
lower than estimated at the time the pro-
gram was enacted. Beneficiary enrollment
has been robust, and enrollee premiums have
remained low and stable. Enrollees are large-
ly satisfied with their plan. The statutory
‘‘non-interference’’ clause is a key reason for
the program’s success.
While the Part D program has provided
beneficiaries with a crucial lifeline through
access to prescription medications, improve-
ments are needed to lower high out-of-pock-
et costs and to realize better value for the
taxpayer-supported Medicare program. Some
have suggested that allowing the Secretary
to negotiate for the price of drugs will
achieve those aims. I believe that talk of
eliminating the non-interference clause is
misguided and counterproductive. I ask that
you answer the questions below as to inform
the policy debate on this matter.
If the Secretary was given authority to ne-
gotiate by Congress and used that authority,
would it be possible to obtain savings in
Medicare?
Could negotiating by the Secretary over
drug prices obtain savings for the Medicare
program if those negotiations were limited
to selective instances?
Thank you for your attention to the Part
D program that has benefited millions of
Medicare beneficiaries. Please contact my
staff if you have questions.
Sincerely,
CHARLES E. GRASSLEY,
Chairman.

Re: Negotiation Over Drug Prices in Medi-
care.
Hon. CHUCK GRASSLEY,
Chairman, Committee on Finance,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: You asked for up-
dated answers to two questions that CBO ad-
dressed in a letter to Senator Wyden in 2007.
Those questions relate to the Medicare Part
D prescription drug benefit and options for
allowing the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to negotiate over the prices paid for
drugs under that benefit. Under current law,
the Secretary is prohibited both from inter-
fering in the negotiations between drug man-
ufacturers and the prescription drug plans
(PDPs) that deliver the Medicare benefit and
from requiring a particular formulary or in-
stituting a price structure for the reimburse-
ment of covered drugs.
The questions and the key conclusions
from CBO’s response in 2007 are below. CBO
continues to stand by those conclusions.
If the Secretary was given authority to ne-
gotiate by Congress and used that authority,
would it be possible to obtain savings in
Medicare?
The key factor in determining whether ne-
gotiations would lead to price reductions is
the leverage that the Secretary would have
to secure larger price concessions from drug
manufacturers than competing PDPs cur-
rently obtain. Negotiation is likely to be ef-
fective only if it is accompanied by some
source of pressure on drug manufacturers to
secure price concessions. For example, au-
thority to establish a formulary could be a
source of pressure. In the absence of such
pressure, the Secretary’s ability to issue
credible threats or take other actions in an
effort to obtain significant discounts would
be limited. Thus, CBO concluded that pro-
viding broad negotiating authority by itself
would likely have a negligible effect on fed-
eral spending.
Could negotiating by the Secretary over
drug prices obtain savings for the Medicare
program if those negotiations were limited
to selective instances?
The authority to engage in negotiations
limited to a few selected drugs or types of
drugs under exceptional circumstances could
potentially generate cost savings. For exam-
ple, negotiations could be focused on drugs
with no close substitutes or those with rel-
atively high prices under Medicare that are
needed to address a public health emergency.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3024 May 22, 2019
In such cases, CBO expects that the effect
of the Secretary’s actions—if he or she took
advantage of the new authority—would pri-
marily reflect the use of the ‘‘bully pulpit’’
to pressure drug manufacturers into reduc-
ing prices. Thus, CBO concluded that the
overall impact on federal spending from ne-
gotiations targeted at selected drugs would
be modest. Beyond that general conclusion,
the precise effect of any specific proposal
would depend importantly on its details.
If you would like further information on
this subject, we would be happy to provide it.
The CBO staff contact is Tom Bradley.
Sincerely,
KEITH HALL,
Director.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, re-
pealing the noninterference clause
means a restricted formulary, which
places limits on the drugs that are
available to seniors, maybe excluding
some drugs that your doctor wants to
prescribe for you. I don’t believe that
Medicare beneficiaries want the gov-
ernment interfering in that process.
Then, as policymakers, we must keep
in mind that we are making decisions
that affect healthcare choices for the
people whom we are elected to rep-
resent.
Let’s all remember to first do no
harm. Repealing the noninterference
clause may sound good, but not even a
spoonful of sugar will help that bad
dose of policy medicine go down.
I come to the floor today to hope
that I can put this issue to rest and, as
we try to work in a bicameral and bi-
partisan way to reduce drug costs, that
we don’t get held up by people who
want to do something different by hav-
ing the government more involved,
when it isn’t going to save any money
and will restrict formularies. It will
get the government between you and
your doctor.
In other words, I am trying to save
Part D. It has been a great success. It
is accepted by the people. Let’s keep
drug costs down without having this
issue interfere with our process.
We need to preserve the foundation of
private enterprise on which Part D is
based—in other words, the marketplace
working. We need to get to the real
work of reducing prescription drug
costs.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
FLOODING IN OKLAHOMA
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, just
to give the Senate body a quick update
of what is happening in my State right
now, we have had some pretty dra-
matic flooding and over 15 tornadoes in
the last 48 hours across the State.
Thankfully, most of those tornadoes
hit in open areas. They did not hit
structures. There have been some
structures that have been damaged,
but the flooding has been far worse
than the tornadoes and the high winds.
Just 2 nights ago, in one of our coun-
ties, Osage County, we had severe flash
flooding, where from 10 p.m. to 2:30 in
the morning, over 100 different homes
had to be evacuated in the middle of
the night. Many of those folks had law
enforcement, firefighters, and first re-
sponders arriving at their home with a
boat or with a truck to get them out,
literally, in their pajamas so they
could escape. Many of those homes
have 4 to 6 feet of water in them now.
It has been intense for those folks
who are in the area. In fact, it is inter-
esting. The director of emergency man-
agement for that area spent the entire
night saving homes and helping people
get out. When dawn broke and they
knew they had gotten everyone out, he
headed back to his own house only to
find out he could no longer get to his
home anymore because of the flood-
waters.
We have had folks all over the State,
whether that be in Perry, where we had
two homes that were destroyed in a
tornado that night that, thankfully,
did not hit the center of town. We had
other spots, like around Eufaula, where
we had some serious flooding; Still-
water, where there has been flooding.
In Dale we had a very dangerous over-
night tornado that came in, literally,
while everyone was sleeping. There are
pockets of folks who are there who
have been affected by this, literally, all
over the State.
For the department of transportation
folks, for the folks in our police and
fire departments, for the emergency
management individuals—both for the
State and the counties—for mayors and
city managers, for hospitals, for coun-
ty workers, for city staff, for the Corps
of Engineers, and, quite frankly, for
just neighbors down the street, it has
been a long week. There have been a
lot of folks serving each other to take
care of those needs, and there will be
for a while.
I thought this body would need a
quick update because sometimes people
feel a long way from the center of the
country when you are in Washington,
DC, but we need to understand what is
happening in the center of the country
right now—literally, the center of
America. It is affecting all Americans.
TULSA RACE RIOT ANNIVERSARY
Mr. President, I did want to tell a
story, though. It is a little bit of a dif-
ferent story. It is about 9,000 people in
Tulsa who were suddenly left homeless.
It wasn’t this week, and it wasn’t a
natural disaster. It was actually on
June 1, 1921, when the worst race riot/
massacre happened in American his-
tory. That story is still one that this
body needs to remember.
I brought this up a few years ago, and
I thought it may be time to bring it up
again. The reason is that we are quick-
ly approaching the 100-year anniver-
sary of a whole series of riots that hap-
pened around America in the summer
of 1919.
As the soldiers were coming back
home from World War I, many of whom
were African-American soldiers who
had served with great dignity and
honor there, they returned back home
with skills that they had picked up
overseas and with a tenacious patriot-
ism and work ethic. They returned
back to America to go back to work,
but they were greeted by a lot of White
business owners and a lot of White
workers in the country who said: You
may have served overseas and fought
the war, but you are not welcome to
work here. And White neighbors start-
ed setting homes and cities on fire.
There were riots. There were pro-
tests. There was a national pushback
that happened in the summer of 1919.
Chicago and Washington, DC, were
some of the worst. Oklahoma really
survived it well.
Interestingly enough, in Oklahoma,
we have 30 towns that were considered
Black towns, scattered all across the
State. The first folks who actually
came to Oklahoma who were African
American actually came with the five
Tribes when they were relocated. They
were brought by the five Tribes who
had held them as slaves. When they
moved from the southeastern part of
the country, and they moved to East-
ern Oklahoma and were relocated there
in that tragic walk, they brought their
slaves with them.
In the land rush after 1889 and then
years later as we became a State, land
started opening up and individuals and
families who were African Americans
moved from all over the country com-
ing for new hope and opportunity.
There were 30 different towns that
sprung up all over Oklahoma that were
predominantly African-American
towns. One of those was Greenwood.
At that time, it was affectionately
known as ‘‘Black Wall Street.’’ It was
one of the most prosperous African-
American communities in the entire
country. It was right on the north end
of Tulsa.
Although, when they left from Green-
wood and came into Tulsa to work, to
shop, or whatever it may be, they were
limited. In Greenwood, there were
shops, stores, movie theaters, lawyers,
doctors, and all kinds of activities. Ev-
erything was there. But if they walked
a few blocks from Greenwood into
Tulsa, they found themselves not being
welcomed.
In fact, in downtown Tulsa, there was
only one place where a Black man
could actually go to the bathroom—
one. It was in that building that a gen-
tleman named Dick Rowland took the
elevator up to go to the bathroom. On
the elevator, there was a White girl
there named Sarah Page.
We have no idea what happened in
that elevator, but when the elevator
door opened, she screamed, and a crowd
quickly grabbed Dick Rowland and
pulled him off, accusing him of all
kinds of things, and hauled him off to
jail in downtown Tulsa, where, within
a few hours, a lynch mob gathered
around that jail.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3025
May 22, 2019
To their credit, law enforcement in
Tulsa went out to the streets and said:
You all go home. But they did not. The
mob stayed there.
Soldiers who had served faithfully in
World War I, who were African Ameri-
cans, who lived in Greenwood, picked
up their rifles and gathered together to
go in and support law enforcement who
was at the jail in downtown Tulsa to
protect Dick Rowland.
As they marched down to go help, the
law enforcement there apparently said:
You all leave as well. We have got this
handled.
But as they left, there was a scuffle
in the street, and a shot was fired. We
have no idea how it happened or which
happened first. The news never re-
ported that. But we know that those
groups of African-American men left
and ran back to Greenwood, and the
mob followed them. They marched
their way to Greenwood, and they
burned it down, destroying Greenwood
and wiping out that city.
That night, all night long—May 31
into June 1—America experienced one
of its darkest moments. There were
1,200 homes destroyed that night in
Greenwood. There were 9,000 people
who were left homeless. There were
6,000 African Americans who were
rounded up by the police in Tulsa and
jailed ‘‘for their protection.’’ They
were the ones who were held, not the
rioters who actually caused the mas-
sacre.
The numbers are all over the place of
how many people actually died that
night. There are numbers as small as 35
and as large as 300. We will never know.
But let’s just say there were many—
very likely, hundreds of people—who
died that night. One-third of the people
were gone, and we have no idea what
direction they went. One-third of the
people packed up and moved and left,
and one-third of the folks stayed. But
interestingly enough, that Sunday,
after the fire, after the riots, after the
destruction and after Greenwood was
left leveled, folks from Greenwood
gathered that Sunday for worship.
Dr. Olivia Hooker passed away just
this last November. She was one of the
last survivors of the Tulsa Race Mas-
sacre. In an interview shortly before
she passed away, she told the story of
hearing the men with axes destroy her
sister’s piano during the riot. With her
three siblings, she hid under a table as
her home was literally destroyed
around her.
You would think that devastation
would be the end of her story. It was
not. In World War II, she became the
first African American to join the
Coast Guard. She earned degrees from
two universities and ended up being a
professor at Fordham University. That
is tenacious resilience.
She reminds me of my modern-day
friend Donna Jackson. In 2013, Donna
Jackson determined that North Tulsa
in Greenwood was known for its entre-
preneurship. That is why it got the
name ‘‘Black Wall Street.’’ In 2013, she
determined that she was going to chal-
lenge 100 new businesses to start in
Greenwood, to bring life back to that
area again with business and entrepre-
neurship. For its 100th anniversary,
there would be 100 new businesses.
Donna lives and breathes Greenwood.
She was born in Morton Memorial. She
goes to church in North Tulsa, she
works in North Tulsa, and she believes
in North Tulsa’s future, as do I. She is
going to make her goal of 100 new busi-
nesses there. She is doing the work to
help introduce people to North Tulsa
and to be engaged. There are compa-
nies that are from outside the area
that are coming in, such as the new QT
that just opened there. There are lots
of individual businesses that continue
to start and thrive again in North
Tulsa.
North Tulsa is a place where we
should practice basic reconciliation,
where America should stop and look
again and say ‘‘What can be done, and
what have we done?’’ and fix it.
Josh Jacobs was born in North Tulsa
in 1998 and graduated from high school
in North Tulsa. He ended up making a
very bad decision. He left North Tulsa
to go play football for the University of
Alabama—clearly a terrible decision.
Josh ended up being drafted 24th over-
all by the Oakland Raiders last year.
He is a tremendous, shining example of
somebody who grew up in North Tulsa
and is representing us well.
His dad made an interesting state-
ment. He said that as Josh was growing
up, he was a great athlete. He could
have traveled anywhere in the area to
play football in high school. He chose
to stay there on the north side. He
said: ‘‘This is the north side. Why not
build up our side of town? Why take off
and leave?’’
You would be pleased to know that
Josh has on his own Twitter account ‘‘2
Peter 3:9.’’ That is what is pinned at
the top.
The Lord is not slow in doing what he
promised, the way some people understand
slowness. But God is being patient with you.
He does not want anyone to be lost, but he
wants all people to change their hearts and
their lives.
That is a pretty good message, Josh.
I believe we are still a nation of rec-
onciliation. The first step in reconcili-
ation is not forgetting who we were
and who we have been as a nation and
to make sure we take the steps nec-
essary to resolve broken relationships.
There is not a law we can pass in this
body that will solve the race issue.
There are ways we can protect and
make sure every person has every op-
portunity, whether it be in housing,
employment, or whatever it may be.
Race is not a political issue; race is a
heart issue. The primary issue with
race begins in your own heart and in
your own family.
Several years ago, I started asking a
very simple question of folks in Okla-
homa. I asked that same question of
people here. ‘‘Has your family ever in-
vited a family of another race to your
home for dinner?’’ Interestingly
enough, the response I get back from
most people when I ask that is, they
will smile at me and say ‘‘I have
friends of another race,’’ to which I
will smile at them and say ‘‘That is not
what I asked. I asked, has your family
ever invited a family of another race to
your home for dinner?’’
Being able to have real dialogue so
that your kids can sit with kids of an-
other race and can watch you interact
as a parent with people from another
race and see that it is normal conversa-
tion—our kids believe only what they
see, and if they never see someone from
another race in our home, they just as-
sume we don’t have friends of another
race.
I like to say we will never get all the
issues about race on the table until we
get our feet under the same table and
start talking this out as friends. Rec-
onciliation is not something we can
legislate; reconciliation is something
we do, it is who we are, and it comes
about by action.
Next week, folks will gather in Tulsa,
OK, again to recognize that 98 years
ago, the city was on fire, and most of
the White community looked away
while Greenwood burned to the ground.
Two years from now, the entire coun-
try will probably pause for 24 hours and
will look at Tulsa and will ask a simple
question: What has changed in 100
years? It is a fair question. I think
Tulsa will stand up and say: We will
not just show you the structures that
it changed, but we will show you the
hearts that it changed.
Tulsa is a very different community
now. We still have a ways to go, as does
the rest of the State, but we are mak-
ing tremendous progress. While much
of the world ignores race and chooses
never to deal with race, we as Ameri-
cans embrace each other and say: What
do we have to do to restore what is bro-
ken and to make sure we see each
other as friends and neighbors again?
We are doing it differently, and that is
a great benefit to us.
Mount Zion Baptist Church was
founded in 1909 by Rev. Sandy Lyons. It
was originally just a one-room school-
house. In 1916, the church began a
$92,000 endeavor, which I can assure
you was a lot of money in 1916. They
took out a $50,000 loan to build a new
church. Construction was completed in
early 1921. On April 4, 1921, they held
their first service, and on June 1 of
that same year, a riot burned it to the
ground. Worse yet, the White insurance
company refused to pay their insur-
ance, saying it was their fault that the
riot happened.
That congregation could have been
bitter; instead, they stayed put, and
they rebuilt that church. They first
paid off the mortgage for what had
been burned to the ground, and then
they rebuilt the church in that same
location.
Vernon AME Church still stands in
the same spot. The only thing left of
that building was the basement, but

they rebuilt, by 1928, right on that
same spot.
Dr. Turner there is a friend and is a
pastor there. He made this statement:
I’m humbled every day to walk through a
place that has seen so much terror but has
also been a vessel of hope for so many people.
After the massacre, people who lost their
homes and their belongings still went to
church on Sunday morning.
Believing in a God of reconciliation,
whom I still believe in today, let’s con-
tinue to get better, but let’s not forget
where we came from so it never ever
happens again.
As we think about the summer of
1919, when the Nation was on fire from
so many riots around the country, let’s
continue to finish what has begun in
our hearts until that is complete.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
ABORTION
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to
express my deep concern over the con-
stant attacks on women’s health we
are seeing all across America. From
this administration’s policies, to Don-
ald Trump’s judicial nominees, to Gov-
ernors and legislators in States like
Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri under
Republican leadership—they are deny-
ing women their constitutional right
to make their own personal and
healthcare decisions.
Women and their healthcare should
not be under constant threat. We as a
nation have made great efforts to pro-
mote equal rights for women and men.
In this Congress, we will celebrate the
100th anniversary of women’s suffrage.
It took a long time for women to get
the right to vote, and we continue to
make progress on equality. Yet, in the
21st century, the Trump administra-
tion continues to push and adopt poli-
cies that are setting this country and
women in a wrong direction.
The Supreme Court made it clear in
Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v.
Wade that there is a constitutional
right to privacy that includes making
healthcare decisions such as the use of
contraception and the right to access
abortion.
Through advancements in women’s
health and access to contraception and
education, the number of unintended
pregnancies has significantly been re-
duced, with a corresponding reduction
in abortion. Yet we see Republican
leaders trying to reverse the advance-
ments our Nation has made in women’s
health, access to contraception, and
education.
For nearly 50 years, the Supreme
Court has upheld the legal precedent of
Roe v. Wade, including its affirmation
in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992.
In that case, the Supreme Court held
that ‘‘our law affords constitutional
protection to personal decisions relat-
ing to marriage . . . contraception,
family relationships, child rearing, and
education. . . . These matters, involv-
ing the most intimate and personal
choices a person may make in a life-
time, choices central to personal dig-
nity and autonomy, are central to the
liberty protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment.’’
The Court prohibited States from
passing statutes that placed undue bur-
dens on a woman’s right to make her
own healthcare decisions. Yet Repub-
lican leaders continue to introduce and
pass laws that interfere with a wom-
en’s autonomy over her health and
well-being.
Last week, for instance, the Repub-
lican Governor of Alabama signed a
bill into law banning almost all abor-
tions in that State, with no exceptions
for the cases of rape or incest. The law
not only prosecutes women, but it also
includes unprecedented criminal pen-
alties against doctors, threatening
them with life in prison for treating
women. The Alabama law exposes doc-
tors to felony charges punishable by up
to 99 years in prison for providing or
attempting to provide an abortion,
making this the most extreme ban of
its kind to pass in nearly 30 years.
Since the beginning of 2019, bills at-
tempting to restrict abortion have
been filed in 45 States, including Ala-
bama, Missouri, and Georgia.
Earlier this year, Georgia’s Repub-
lican Governor signed a 6-week ban
into law that would make it illegal for
women to terminate a pregnancy and a
doctor to perform the termination
after a fetal heartbeat is detected. I
must tell you, many women don’t even
realize they are pregnant at 6 weeks.
The Alabama and Georgia bills im-
pose burdensome and medically unnec-
essary limitations on women and their
doctors, particularly those in low-in-
come, medically underserved areas.
The bills harm women who are victims
of sexual assault and minors who are
victims of incest. These provisions ap-
pear to be designed to perpetrate a cul-
ture of not believing women and trying
to discredit the victims of assault.
It is hard to understand how many
Republicans are talking about getting
Big Government out of people’s lives
but not when it comes to one of the
hardest and most intimate decisions a
woman can make—a decision that she
wishes to make between herself and her
doctor. In those circumstances, these
same colleagues believe that Big Gov-
ernment, and not the woman herself,
knows better. They believe that gov-
ernment, and not the woman, should
dictate whether she can or cannot have
control of her own body. They believe
that government should have the
power to force a woman to forgo a
medically necessary procedure. They
believe that women should be stripped
of that power and stripped of the
choice to decide what is best for her-
self. Many believe that even in cases of
incest and rape, where the woman is a
victim of a crime, that the woman
should be compelled to bear the child
against her will and bring the preg-
nancy to term. Talk about being intru-
sive.
Basically, the rights of women are
being trampled to death. I thought we
had gotten beyond that, and now we
see that we are moving in the wrong di-
rection.
Empowering women is one of the
most important things we can do for
the future of our country. Core to
women’s constitutional liberties is au-
tonomy over their own health and well-
being. If we truly want to support
women, we need to safeguard and im-
prove, not limit, access to comprehen-
sive healthcare.
I hope we can all agree that on this
100th anniversary of women’s suffrage,
we should be looking at ways to re-
move discrimination based upon sex
and not moving in the wrong direction
by taking away from women their
right to make their own healthcare de-
cisions.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order

objection, it is so ordered.
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, we
are now 5 months into the new 116th
Congress. During that 5-month period,
the new Democratic majority in the
House of Representatives has passed a
series of bills on issues important to
the overwhelming majority of the
American public. They include legisla-
tion to reduce the death toll from gun
violence by requiring universal crimi-
nal background checks and legislation
to end the millions and millions of dol-
lars of secret money flowing into elec-
tions and polluting our politics. The
House legislation includes a bill to en-
sure that women receive equal pay for
equal work, and the House has also
passed legislation to strengthen the
protections under the Violence Against
Women Act. Those are just some of the
initiatives the House has passed in the
last 5 months.
Here in the Senate, what has the
Senate done on those important issues?
What has the Senate done with the leg-
islation that the House has passed and
is now sitting in this body? We have
done nothing—zip. We haven’t taken up
any of those bills. In fact, the Senate
Republican leader has refused to allow
this body to consider those important
measures.
What are we doing instead? Instead,
the Senate is consuming all of its time
not on the matters most important to
the public but on debating and con-
firming judicial and executive branch
nominees. Here is the thing: If you
look at these judicial nominees—let’s
just take the ones we are looking at
this week—you will find a very dan-
gerous pattern.
This week, in looking at the five
nominees, the pattern is selecting
judges who will strip away women’s re-
productive choices and who will strip

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3027
May 22, 2019
away and potentially eliminate the
rights under Roe v. Wade. That is the
clear pattern.
If you look at the records of these
nominees, they indicate hostility to-
ward a woman’s right to choose and
hostility to Roe v. Wade. Take, for ex-
ample, Stephen Clark. He is the nomi-
nee for the Eastern District of Mis-
souri. He drew the outrageous compari-
son between Dred Scott and Roe v.
Wade, including Roe as bad law. He
also opposed provisions in the Afford-
able Care Act that would expand access
to contraception to help people avoid
unintended pregnancies.
Then there is the nomination of Ken-
neth Bell to be a judge in the Western
District of North Carolina. He has ar-
gued that abortion rights, the pro-
choice position, is ‘‘indefensible’’ and
went on to say that ‘‘there is no middle
ground’’ on this issue. In other words,
he is another judge who would deny
women the right of reproductive
choice, and the list goes on if you look
at the list of judges who are before the
Senate this week.
This would be alarming at any point
in time, but the timing of these nomi-
nations is no coincidence. Just in the
last couple of months, we have seen
States around the country passing laws
to take away a woman’s right to
choose.
Let’s take a look at Alabama. In the
case of Alabama, they passed a law
that denies a woman’s right to choose
to have an abortion even in the case of
rape or incest. Under the Alabama law,
doctors who perform abortions could be
locked up in prison for up to 99 years—
a prison term longer than that of a rap-
ist.
We also have Candidate Trump argu-
ing that not only should doctors be
punished but women who exercise their
rights to reproductive choice should be
punished too.
Meanwhile, in addition to Alabama,
five other States have passed laws that
would outlaw abortion at a very early
stage—in fact, at a stage of pregnancy
when many women do not realize they
are yet pregnant, especially if the preg-
nancy is unplanned and unexpected.
I think people recognize how out-
rageous it is to see State legislators
and other elected officials who nor-
mally take the position that the gov-
ernment has no place in regulating or
being involved in any aspect of our
lives, who then take the position that
they want the government right be-
tween a woman and her most sensitive
decisions with respect to reproductive
choice.
We have legislators who say they
don’t want the government protecting
people from air pollution. They don’t
want to pass any regulations to protect
people from air pollution or water pol-
lution. We have some legislators who
say they don’t want any legislation to
protect consumers from predatory
lending or other scams in the economy.
They don’t think the government has a
role there, but, by God, when it comes
to interfering with a woman’s right to
choose, they want the government
smack in the middle of that decision.
That is what Alabama has done. That
is what the other five States have
done.
Now we have judicial nominees com-
ing before the Senate who are going to
sign off potentially on those State
laws.
It gets even more alarming because
we also see a pattern from the judicial
decisions that have been made and
from the records of a lot of the nomi-
nees who are before us now of judges or
people being appointed, who not only
want to strip away a woman’s right to
reproductive choice but who actually
want to go after programs that help
provide family planning, programs that
help prevent unwanted and unplanned
pregnancies. So, on the one hand,
States are passing these laws restrict-
ing a woman’s right to choose, but at
the same time they are saying that
they want to get rid of or severely
limit programs that prevent unin-
tended pregnancies.
Looking at the figures from the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion—and they keep statistics on all
sorts of health indicators—you will
find that from 2006 to the year 2015,
there was a 24-percent drop in the num-
ber of abortions in the United States.
There was a 24-percent drop in the
years between 2006 and 2015. Research-
ers who have looked into this have de-
termined that the biggest driver behind
this decline in abortion has been in-
creased access to contraception and
family planning. Yet the Trump admin-
istration is going after and targeting
for elimination the very programs that
help reduce unintended pregnancy and,
therefore, also help reduce abortions.
So this administration is trying to
take a hatchet to title X. They want to
essentially take Planned Parenthood
out of the equation, even though
Planned Parenthood provides family
planning services to 4 in 10 women.
As we all know, Planned Parenthood
is barred by law from spending any
Federal dollars on abortion. They
spend most of their time counseling
their patients on family planning and
helping people make decisions about
contraception to avoid unplanned preg-
nancies.
This administration tried to target
the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Pro-
gram. I know that because it went
after a program in Baltimore City that
has been very successful in reducing
teenage pregnancy.
In fact, if you look at Baltimore from
a period during the year of 2000 to 2016,
we saw a 61-percent decline in teen
pregnancy. That was as a result of a
number of programs, easier access to
contraception, the Teen Pregnancy
Prevention Program that was targeted
for elimination by the Trump adminis-
tration, and, after the Affordable Care
Act went into effect, the ability to ac-
cess contraception as a result of the
Affordable Care Act.
All of these measures to help prevent
unplanned pregnancies have also
helped to significantly reduce the num-
ber of abortions. Yet we have an ad-
ministration that wants to go after
those family planning programs, and
we have a number of judges who would
side with the administration. I will
mention a couple of important family
planning programs.
One is title X. This administration
wanted to severely undermine title X.
It has not been successful. Why not?
Because it was taken to court. So far,
the courts have stayed the administra-
tion’s decision.
Let’s look at the Teen Pregnancy
Prevention Program, which I men-
tioned, that is so important in Balti-
more. The administration wanted to
eliminate it, and so we had to go to
court. The judge said that it was an il-
legal action—an unauthorized action—
by the Trump administration.
Let’s look at the contraception pro-
visions—the provisions on access to
contraception—in the Affordable Care
Act. This administration wants to wipe
them out. The only reason they are
still there is due to the courts. The
courts have been very important not
only in protecting a woman’s right to
choose but in protecting these impor-
tant family planning programs that
have prevented unintended pregnancies
and, therefore, have also reduced the
number of abortions.
Now we have a whole bunch of judges
who are coming before the Senate who
would rule differently in all of these
cases. That is why I believe the Amer-
ican people need to really be alarmed
about what is happening here. We are
not acting on important measures that
are coming out of the House that I
mentioned earlier. What we are doing
is spending the full time passing
through judges—in a factory-like pro-
cedure here—who will undermine a
woman’s right to choose and go after
important family planning programs.
We have a lot to think about, and I
hope all of our colleagues will recog-
nize what is happening here.
I will go back to where I started.
Instead of churning out judges who
are going to strip away the rights of
women—and other nominees who side
with big corporations against con-
sumers—let’s take up the legislation
that is in front of us right now that has
come over from the House.
We have before us H.R. 8. It is the Bi-
partisan Background Checks legisla-
tion. It was bipartisan because it came
out of the House on a bipartisan vote.
It was bipartisan because, if you ask
the public, 85 percent of the public is in
favor of the simple idea that we should
have criminal background checks and
that the people who have committed
crimes shouldn’t be able to go to gun
shows and purchase guns. If you have a
record of posing a danger to the com-
munity, my goodness, why would we
want to put a gun in your hand and en-
danger the community?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3028 May 22, 2019
It is a pretty straightforward piece of
legislation, and it has been in this Sen-
ate for 83 days now. For 83 days, it has
been sitting right here in the Senate,
but the Republican leader will not let
us take it up to debate it or to vote on
it.
I mentioned another bill that came
over from the House that would get rid
of secret money in politics. What do I
mean by that?
After the Supreme Court decision in
Citizens United, we had two things
happen. One was that just a flood of
corporate money flew into elections be-
cause, before that decision, corpora-
tions could not spend money directly
to try to elect public officials. The
Congress had previously passed a law
to prevent that, and previous Supreme
Courts had upheld that ban on cor-
porate spending to try to elect public
officials. In Citizens United, they de-
cided, well, corporations are people,
too, for the purpose of spending money
in elections. So they got rid of that
law.
If you read that opinion, even those
who voted to overturn those laws said
that what is going to protect the sys-
tem will be the public’s knowing who
will be spending all of that money.
They said: All right, we are going to let
corporations spend all of that money.
We are going to let 501(c)(4)s spend all
of that money. Do you know what? The
public will know, and that will serve as
a check on the system. That will pro-
vide transparency, and the trans-
parency will provide accountability.
Guess what. It didn’t happen. In fact,
the Senate’s Republican leader has
been one of the arch opponents of any
kind of transparency and disclosure. I
have had a long-running back-and-
forth with him on this issue because,
even if you look at the proponents of
the terrible Citizens United decision, as
I said, those Justices said: Well, trans-
parency will take care of it. The re-
ality is that people spend millions and
millions of dollars in secret money in
elections.
Let me just tell people that it may be
secret to the public, but it is not a big
secret to the candidates who are run-
ning. It is not a big secret to them who
is spending millions of dollars to try to
get them elected or to defeat them.
That is a farce. Years ago, when I was
in the House, I authored something
called the DISCLOSE Act. It passed the
House. It died here by one vote. We got
59 votes on an almost identical bill. It
didn’t get 60. So we still have secret
money in politics today.
My view is that voters have a right
to know who is spending millions of
dollars to try to influence their deci-
sions, and that is a big part of the bill
that came over from the House 74 days
ago. It is called the For the People Act.
It has a lot of other important provi-
sions in it to protect our elections and
important provisions to make sure
that we uphold the right to vote.
Among the important provisions is
the DISCLOSE Act—to get rid of secret
money in politics. That is sitting over
here and has been for 74 days.
What else has the House sent over? It
sent over the Equal Pay Act, which has
a pretty straightforward idea, and I
think most Americans agree with it. In
fact, public surveys show that people
agree that if you put in an equal day’s
work—if you put in the sweat equity, if
you do the job—and if a woman does
the job just like the man does the job,
by God, obviously, she should get paid
the same amount. It is a pretty simple
concept. That came over from the
House. In fact, it came over from the
House just 55 days ago. For 55 days, it
has been sitting here.
Another bill that has come over from
the House also relates to making sure
that we address issues that are impor-
tant to all of us, but it has specifically
dealt with the Violence Against
Women Act. What we say within the
Violence Against Women Act, in the
House bill, is that if you have someone
who is abusing you in a relationship—
it doesn’t have to be your spouse; it
could be someone else who is abusing
you in a relationship—they shouldn’t
be able to go out and buy a gun. What
we have seen from the sad statistics is
that those kinds of situations often es-
calate into somebody’s getting killed
when someone is in a relationship in
which one of the people in that rela-
tionship is abusing the other.
Just as we prevent the sale of guns to
spouses who have records of domestic
violence and domestic abuse, we should
extend that prohibition on running out
and getting guns to other abusive rela-
tionships. That was the reauthoriza-
tion of the Violence Against Women
Act, and it passed out of the House 47
days ago. So, 47 days ago, the House
passed the reauthorization of the Vio-
lence Against Women Act.
It passed the Paycheck Fairness
Act—equal pay for equal work—55 days
ago.
It passed the For the People Act 74
days ago, which includes the provision
to get rid of secret money in politics.
It also passed the Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act—to reduce the
death toll from gun violence in our
country—83 days ago.
All of those bills are sitting right
here in the Senate. We could be debat-
ing them today if the Republican lead-
er would allow them to come up. In-
stead of taking up that important
work, we are here, acting like those in
a factory who churn out more judges
who have records of stripping women of
their right to reproductive choice. It is
a very, very dark time in the Senate,
and I hope that we will get about the
business of the American people and
stop stripping women of their constitu-
tional rights.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PERDUE). The Senator from Missouri.
NOMINATION OF STEPHEN R. CLARK
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I think,
by any standard, it is a stretch to sug-
gest that we are churning out judges.
We are doing our constitutional job of
confirming judges that the President is
constitutionally required to nominate.
We are going to vote on a Missouri
judge today, Judge Stephen Clark, to
be a judge on the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Missouri.
In the process of churning out judges,
Judge Clark—or soon-to-be Judge
Clark, I hope—was told by the White
House in July of 2017 that he was going
to be its nominee for this place on the
court. If it were July of 2017 and it is
now May of 2019, the churning is, obvi-
ously, not going very well. In fact, to
get people to even serve in these jobs is
going to get increasingly difficult.
In the case of Steve Clark and his
family, he had a pretty unique practice
that was focused on him and a couple
of associates. I am not even sure of the
kind of law they practiced, but I am
sure it was not the kind of law that
was referred to a minute ago. His wife
was the assistant in the office, and I
think they had an associate or two.
Yet, if all of your clients have been
told for 20 months or so that you are
going to be a district judge, the first
question they ask is, Can you handle
this case?
The answer you give is, Well, I don’t
know, but probably not. Eventually,
Congress will get to this, and, eventu-
ally, I will be confirmed.
From the time of July 2017 to Novem-
ber 2018, there was nobody coming in
the door anymore, and the law practice
closed, as it should. It was not forced
to close. Clearly, the best thing to do
was to go ahead and admit that the
supporting effort of that practice had
gone away but that the overhead was
still there. Since November, Stephen
Clark has been waiting for this day to
happen. This is not churning out
judges, and I may get back to this
topic in just a minute.
Certainly, for nominees like him who
are willing to have their names sub-
mitted—who are willing to say yes
when asked if they would be willing to
be nominees—we have to do a better
job, not the job of suggesting that
somehow this happens easily to people
who aren’t qualified.
Steve Clark has been a respected,
practicing attorney in the Eastern Dis-
trict of Missouri for 28 years. He knows
the law; he knows the community. The
American Bar Association rated him
‘‘well qualified’’ to hold this job.
He has been approved by the Senate
Judiciary Committee twice now, once
in 2016—see if I have that right; there is
so much history here, it is hard to even
know what the book would look like—
and once before the 2018 election. Then
all of these nominees had to be sent
back to the White House, so after the
2018 election, after the Congress start-
ed work again in January of 2019, his
name had to be resubmitted. The com-
mittee had to vote on him again. They
had to look once again to see that he
was ‘‘well qualified’’ to hold this job.
They had to once again verify that he
had 28 years in private practice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3029
May 22, 2019
We even had a past president of the
Missouri Bar Association, who is a
Democrat, say: ‘‘Steve Clark will make
an excellent addition to the federal
court bench.’’
The very idea that we characterize
judges we are putting on the courts as
enemies of any group of people is pret-
ty offensive when you think about it.
The law of the land is the law of the
land. Judges are bound by precedent.
Certainly, lawyers are bound by prece-
dent. There is nothing to suggest any-
thing other than the ‘‘well qualified’’
status of the bar association.
We need to fill this vacancy. We even
have a temporary judgeship in the
Eastern District. The workload is so
great that the temporary judgeship
should become permanent, but that is
not the judgeship we are talking about
here.
We are talking about somebody who
is ready for this job, willing to give up
his law practice with what should have
been an absolute certainty he would be
confirmed, but no absolute certainty
he would be confirmed. I certainly wish
the process hadn’t taken so long, but I
am glad we were able to adjust the
rules of the Senate last month to start
getting more people through that proc-
ess. Without that, people in this case in
my State—the people in the Eastern
District of Missouri—would have to
wait even longer. We may have never
gotten this judgeship filled if we hadn’t
changed the rules.
Unfortunately, there are still a whole
lot of people waiting to be confirmed to
important jobs in the government.
There is still too much obstruction for
no real reason.
In fact, in past Congresses, judge-
ships like this would have been filled
by unanimous consent. We would have
filled five or six a day if we had vacan-
cies of well-qualified candidates at the
end of the day with no debate, but our
friends on the other side have decided:
No, we are going to take the maximum
amount of debatable time available for,
say, a Supreme Court Justice or the
Attorney General of the United States,
and we are going to apply that to every
job—district judges, the assistant sec-
retary of whatever, who is the lowest
person appointed in whatever Cabinet
office there is. We are going to apply
the 30 hours to them. Of course, what
you did to do that is use up all of this
time because nothing else can happen
on the floor during that 30 hours.
Was debate happening on the floor
during that 30 hours? Of course not.
The average debate time used during
that 30 hours was 24 minutes. So for
the other 29 hours and 36 minutes,
nothing happened that related to that
judgeship.
This morning, when I was driving to
the Capitol, I actually heard somebody
on one of the news programs say: Now
they are forcing judges to be confirmed
with only 2 hours of debate instead of
the 30 hours that should have been
used.
That would have been a valid criti-
cism if the 30 hours were ever used, but
when the 30 hours is only 24 minutes, it
is no criticism at all. It is a ridiculous
position to take. You don’t have to be
a genius to see that it is designed to
not allow the President to have the
jobs confirmed in the government that
the Congress has determined that the
Senate would have to confirm. There
are, I think, about 970 of them. By the
way, if you took 30 hours for each of
the 970, I think it would have been im-
possible—and we were proving it was
impossible—for the President to ever
get a government in place.
Then the judicial vacancies that
occur—this is a vacancy we are filling
today that was vacant months before
President Trump was elected, maybe 3
months, maybe 4 months, but we
haven’t had anybody in this judgeship
now for well over 2 years. In fact, as I
said earlier, we have had, for 22
months, somebody who was told they
were going to be the nominee and to
prepare to serve.
In the 3 weeks we were in session be-
fore the rule change, we were able to
confirm seven nominees in 3 weeks, and
that was the principal work we were
doing in that 3 weeks. These nominees
fill jobs that are running the govern-
ment or court positions that they are
appointed to serve in for a long time.
We filled seven of them in 3 weeks.
In the 3 weeks after we had the rule
change, we cleared 24 nominees in that
period of time.
By the way, the debate spent an aver-
age of 3 minutes—of the 2 hours that
were available to those 24 nominees,
the average time spent debating was 3
minutes. The minority is still sug-
gesting that we are going to use the
maximum time no matter how little
time is used, no matter how little time
is called for, because even if it is not 30
hours—it is now 2 hours—we can force
2 hours of no legislative opportunity
and no legislative planning as the Sen-
ate tries to do part of the job that only
the Senate can do. The House doesn’t
do this; only the Senate can do this.
This is a job that is done by the Presi-
dent, who nominates, and the Senate,
which confirms.
If you can keep the Senate con-
firming part to a maximum use of
time, if you are in the minority, you
can keep the legislating opportunities
to a minimum.
Now, somebody might say: Well, gee,
what would they bring to the floor?
There are a lot of things we would
bring to the floor if we had the time to
get on them and stay on them.
Of course, we would really like to
bring the appropriating bills to the
floor soon and do those.
We cleared 24 nominees with an aver-
age of 3 minutes of talking about each
one—maybe a few minutes. I think
that even includes the time just mak-
ing aspersions about these nominees in
general, which don’t relate to anybody.
That would be included in that 3 min-
utes as well.
We continue to have a lack of co-
operation to do the job of the Senate in
the way that for 200 years it was done.
I hope my friends on the other side
will begin to work with us and begin to
understand that everybody has caught
on. The people in this building and out-
side this building know what has been
happening for almost 2.5 years now,
and more responsibility is going to
have to be taken than has been taken
up until now.
I will say, again—almost 2 years
after Steve Clark was nominated—I be-
lieve we will finish that job today, and
if we do, it will be a good day for him,
a good day for his family, and a good
day for people waiting to get an oppor-
tunity on the Federal court docket in
the Eastern District of Missouri to
have a person not decided by me to be
well qualified for the job but decided
by the American Bar Association and
twice approved by the Judiciary Com-
mittee of the U.S. Senate. While this
work has taken a long time to get
done, it will be good to see it done.
I yield the floor.

ator from Illinois.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this
morning we had a meeting in Speaker
PELOSI’s office of the Democratic con-
gressional leaders. It was in prepara-
tion for a meeting with President
Trump.
Three weeks ago, NANCY PELOSI and
CHUCK SCHUMER, the Democratic lead-
ers of the House and Senate, asked for
a sit-down with the President in the
Cabinet Room to discuss the infra-
structure of the United States of Amer-
ica—the backbone of our economy, a
part of America that, sadly, has been
neglected for too many years.
President Trump promised in his
campaign there would be an infrastruc-
ture program—put America to work to
build the roads, the bridges, and the
airports, and I might say broadband
and so many other things that need to
be done—so that the strength of this
economy would be there to entertain
new business opportunities, to attract
new jobs.
We had this meeting 3 weeks ago, and
it was amazing how well it went. I was
sitting just a couple of seats removed
from the President and heard an agree-
ment in the room from the Democratic
leaders and the President—$2 trillion,
the President said. He rejected our
offer of $1.5 trillion and said: No, make
it $2 trillion that we will spend on our
infrastructure.
Everybody sat up straight in their
chairs and said: Well, this President is
serious.
We said: Mr. President, will it be 80
percent Federal spending and 20 per-
cent local, the way it has always been?
Yes.
Can we include rural broadband in
here so those of us who represent small
towns—rural areas that don’t have the
benefit of broadband services—can get
into the 21st century in terms of edu-
cation and telemedicine and all of the
things that brings?
Yes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3030 May 22, 2019
He signed up for all these things—$2
trillion, 80 percent Federal—and the
list was long of things that we were
going to do together.
We went into detail in that meeting
3 weeks ago with the President about
some of the aspects of it. For example,
the President said—and I think he has
been quoted before—that he does not
approve of public-private partnership
programs. He argues there is too much
litigation. That is all right with me
and for most of the people in the room.
We didn’t have to have that if the
President didn’t want to include it. So
there was back and forth in this con-
versation.
There was one element missing, and I
remember RICHARD NEAL—who is the
chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, the critically important
committee, the counterpart of Senate
Finance—said to the President: Now,
Mr. President, we have to pay for it.
Two trillion dollars—how are we going
to do that?
And the President said: Wait. I am
not going to say that at this meeting.
I know you want me to blink first as to
how we are going to pay for it. I am not
going to get into that.
There had been some proposals from
Democrats of tax increases for wealthy
people and corporations and such, but
the President said: I won’t to get into
that today. Let’s meet 3 weeks from
now and talk about how we are going
to do this, how we are going to pay for
the $2 trillion.
So many of us sat down, Democrats—
I hope Republicans, as well—and start-
ed thinking in positive terms about
what this would mean for the economy.
We can create tens of thousands of
good-paying jobs across the United
States, rebuild our infrastructure, and
be ready to compete with countries
like China and others that believe they
are building faster and better than we
are.
The meeting was scheduled for today.
We started this morning with a brief-
ing. The Democrats sat together in
Speaker PELOSI’s office, about 20 of us,
and went through it and talked about
what our presentation would be to the
President and some ideas that we had
to move forward.
We accepted the President’s invita-
tion. We went to the White House,
gathered in the waiting room there,
and then we were invited into the Cabi-
net Room. We walked into the Cabinet
Room, took our assigned seats, looked
across the table, and there was the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, people from the
Office of Management and Budget. The
President’s daughter was there. There
was quite a gathering of people getting
ready for this high-powered meeting.
We waited, and we waited, and then
the door opened, and the President
walked in. Without greeting anyone or
sitting down he said: We are not going
to have this meeting. We are not going
to have this meeting because Congress
continues to investigate me. I think we
have had enough investigations, and
until the investigations end, there will
be no infrastructure bill.
His statement went quite a bit be-
yond that, but I think that was a fair
summary of his conclusion. He turned
around and walked out.
So the meeting that he had called,
the meeting we responded to so that we
could come up with an infrastructure
program, ended right on the spot.
The President then went out into
what is known as the Rose Garden next
to the White House and held a press
conference with posters and signs say-
ing: As long as Congress is inves-
tigating me, we won’t be discussing
issues like infrastructure.
That is an unfortunate develop-
ment—unfortunate for America, first,
because this President and this Con-
gress, regardless of party, have a re-
sponsibility to the American people to
do the basics to make sure that we pro-
vide what Americans need, what cities
need, what businesses need, what fami-
lies need to grow the economy and cre-
ate good-paying jobs.
The President walked away from
that this morning. So here we are at a
point in history. I am not sure which
way to turn. You see, every President
would like to make this claim: I am
not going to do business with Congress
if you investigate me. But the bottom
line is, every President is investigated.
Their administration is investigated.
That is what we do. That is what the
U.S. Congress does. That is what hap-
pens in a democracy. No President can
say: I am pulling down the shades, and
I am closing the doors. You can’t look
at me, and you can’t look at what we
are doing, either in activities as indi-
viduals or as agencies.
No. There is accountability in our
government. This Congress, the Sen-
ate, the House—we appropriate the
funds for the executive branch, and we
investigate them as we appropriate the
money. How are you spending the tax-
payers’ dollars? Are you wasting them?
Is there corruption involved in it? We
ask those questions not just of this
President but of every President. That
is the nature of democracy, of account-
ability, and this President can’t get off
the hook. He may be weary of inves-
tigations—and I can tell you that
President Obama was weary of inves-
tigations, too, and President Bush be-
fore him—but that is the nature of ac-
countability in a democracy. For this
President to say: No more. It is out of
bounds for us to be investigated, and I
won’t do anything necessary for the
economy and future of this country as
long as the investigation continues—
that is a sad day in the history of this
country. I hope cooler heads will pre-
vail, but I am not sure they will.
We have so much we need to do. Look
at this empty Chamber here. My speech
in this Chamber each day is basically
what you are going to hear if you are a
visitor to Washington, DC. You are not
going to hear a debate on legislation.
Wouldn’t you like for this Chamber to
be filled with Republicans and Demo-
crats who are debating a bill right now
on the high cost of prescription drugs?
I would. And we certainly have the
power and responsibility to manage
that issue, but we don’t do it. We have
done virtually nothing in this Chamber
for this entire year.
Senator MCCONNELL has one goal: fill
up Federal judicial vacancies with life-
time appointees as fast and as often as
possible. We have seen men and women
come before us, clearly unqualified to
be judges, who are being given lifetime
appointments. Why? It is part of a
plan—a political plan to fill the courts
with judges friendly to the Republican
point of view. And so we do nothing
else. Nothing else.
I have been here a few years, in the
Senate and the House. There is an issue
called disaster aid. I have seen 100 dif-
ferent variations. There will be some
horrendous weather event—a fire, a
drought, a flood—and we have re-
sponded time and again wherever it oc-
curred. Without concern as to whether
it was a red State or a blue State, we
have come together as an American
family and said: We will give you a
helping hand.
We have a disaster bill that has been
pending here for weeks, if not months.
We can’t even reach an agreement on
how to send disaster aid to areas that
have been hit by flooding and tornados,
and it is an indication of what the
problem is right here. The Senate is
not being the Senate. It is not legis-
lating. And now the President an-
nounced this morning that he has gone
fishing. He is not going to be around to
discuss issues like the infrastructure of
this country.
What can we do about it? Well, you
can appeal to your Members of Con-
gress and tell them you are fed up with
it, and I hope you do. That is what a
democracy is about. But you can also
make sure that you participate and
vote in the next election. Ultimately,
in a democracy, the American people
have the last word at the polling place
on election day. If you are satisfied
with an empty Chamber doing nothing,
ignoring infrastructure, delaying dis-
aster aid, if you think that is a good
thing for this country, I suppose you
know how you should vote. But if you
are fed up with it and looking for
change, I hope people across this coun-
try will see what happened today as a
call to arms—maybe, importantly, a
call to the polls.
IRAN
Mr. President, yesterday there was a
briefing for Members of the Senate,
Democrats and Republicans. It was a
closed-door briefing in an area of the
Capitol the public has no access to. In
that briefing room, they close the
doors; they take away your telephone;
and they ask if you have any other
electronic devices to make sure that
when you walk in that room, you can
hear things, classified information,
sometimes top-secret information,
which is not available to most Ameri-
cans and should not be. It is sensitive.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3031
May 22, 2019
It is important. It relates to our na-
tional security. We don’t meet there a
lot—maybe once a month at most—and
when we meet, we are together as
Democrats and Republicans for a brief-
ing.
The briefing yesterday was from the
Secretary of State, Mr. Pompeo, and
the Acting Secretary of Defense. They
came in and talked to us about the sit-
uation in Iran. I can’t disclose the spe-
cifics—I am duty bound not to—but I
can speak in general terms about what
was said and what I think it means to
the rest of America.
I listened in disbelief yesterday to
the administration’s briefing justifying
a confrontation with Iran. While I was
listening, I thought to myself, before
America plunges into another Middle
Eastern war, we ought to take stock
and remember how we got into the two
wars in that part of the world—two
wars, one of which is still raging, that
left American soldiers subject to injury
and death every day and cost American
taxpayers billions of dollars.
When we got into wars in Afghani-
stan and Iraq, we were led to believe
that suddenly there were urgent events
spiraling out of control in the Middle
East that could only be stopped by U.S.
military intervention. Some of my col-
leagues still in Congress today were
here during that debate. On the floor of
the Senate, we voted on the question of
the invasion of Iraq. I remember it be-
cause it was about 4 weeks before the
election. The vote was taken around
midnight, and most Members, as they
voted, left. I stayed because I wanted
to hear the final vote.
There were 23 of us who voted against
the invasion of Iraq: 1 Republican—
Senator Chafee—and 22 Democrats. I
can recall that some of my colleagues
who voted against that invasion of Iraq
lingered in the well. One of them was
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.
Wellstone was up for reelection—a
tough reelection in his home State.
The popular sentiment was on the side
of the invasion of Iraq. Wellstone voted
against it.
I went up to him, and I said: ‘‘Paul,
I hope this doesn’t cost you the elec-
tion.’’
He said to me: ‘‘It is all right if it
does. This is who I am. This is what I
believe, and the people who elected me
expect nothing less.’’
Sadly, Paul Wellstone died in a plane
crash before that election a few weeks
later. I still remember him right there
in the well, talking to him about that
vote.
At the time, we had been told by Vice
President Cheney and others that Iraq
had weapons of mass destruction,
which threatened not only friends and
allies, like Israel, but could threaten
the United States of America.
Former Pentagon adviser Richard
Perle argued before the invasion of Iraq
that the Iraqis were going to pay for
the war from their oil wealth. They
would pay for this—whatever it would
cost the American taxpayers—and he
said there was no doubt that they
would.
President George W. Bush claimed
the war was his last choice, and then
he provocatively tried to link al-
Qaida—the terrorists responsible for
9/11—with Saddam Hussein, the leader
of Iraq—a specious claim that has
never been proven and was restated by
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.
Rumsfeld even tried to claim that a
war in Iraq would last—listen to this—
‘‘five days or [maybe] maybe five
weeks or five months, but it certainly
isn’t going to last any longer than
that,’’ said our Secretary of Defense,
Donald Rumsfeld. We are now in the
18th year of that war.
Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz and Vice President Cheney
said that when the Americans arrive in
Iraq, we would be welcomed as lib-
erators. Wolfowitz went on to say—he
estimated that this call for hundreds of
thousands of American troops to fight
there was way off the mark.
Five days or 5 weeks or 5 months?
Well, the war started not long after
these claims. It included deploying
more than 150,000 American troops over
and over and over again, and it has
lasted for 18 years. No weapons of mass
destruction were ever found. We were
not greeted as liberators. The Iraqi oil
interest did not pay for the cost of the
war; the American taxpayers and fami-
lies did. Sadly, more than 4,500 Ameri-
cans gave their lives in that war, and
32,000 were wounded, some gravely
wounded.
One of those wounded veterans is my
colleague in the Senate, Senator
TAMMY DUCKWORTH. She was in the Na-
tional Guard as a helicopter pilot.
Twelve years ago, when she was flying
over Iraq, a rocket-propelled grenade
came into the cockpit and exploded. As
the helicopter came to a crash on the
ground, Tammy lost both of her legs
and was at that point in danger of los-
ing her arm, which she didn’t, thank
goodness. Today, she serves as my col-
league in the Senate.
In one of the many cruel ironies in
what I believe to be one of the worst
foreign policy disasters in American
history, the unintended consequence of
our invasion of Iraq was to give the na-
tion of Iran a strategic victory by vir-
tually turning Iraq into a client state.
Make no mistake—our war and inva-
sion of Iraq emboldened and empow-
ered Iran. How do some of the current
occupants of the White House driving
policy against Iran feel about the Iraq
war disaster? Well, in 2015, National
Security Advisor John Bolton said: ‘‘I
still think the decision to overthrow
Saddam was correct.’’ He made that
statement 1 month after writing a New
York Times op-ed—this is John Bolton,
the President’s National Security Ad-
visor—an op-ed entitled: ‘‘To Stop
Iran’s Bomb, Bomb Iran.’’
Now match this painful lesson in his-
tory with the current President having
surpassed 10,000 false or misleading
claims so far in a little over 2 years in
office—more than 10,000 false claims in
less than 3 years. So you will under-
stand my skepticism in trusting this
administration of the President’s to
tell us the truth about the next war
they are planning in the Middle East.
In fact, within a single week, President
Trump tweeted that he had hoped not
to go to war with Iran and then went
on to tweet that he would lead the
fight ‘‘that will be the official end of
Iran.’’ You can’t keep up with this
President and his tweets.
Does this not trouble or give pause to
any Republican colleague whose con-
stituents might be called to serve in
the third Middle Eastern war that the
United States is participating in?
Let me also remind my colleagues
that before any one of us can vote on
the Senate floor, we walk down this
aisle, over to this corner, and wait for
the Vice President of the United States
to ask us to take the oath of office, to
swear to uphold the Constitution of the
United States.
The Constitution of this country
makes it expressly clear that the deci-
sion to go to war cannot be made solely
by a President; it is to be made by the
American people through their elected
representatives in Congress, in the
House and in the Senate. Before there
is any war, the American people should
have the last word, according to our
Constitution.
What I find most stunning about the
administration’s march to war in Iran
is that its actions have really contrib-
uted to the current tension and con-
frontation we have in Iran. President
Obama worked for years to come up
with an agreement and to bring to-
gether an alliance to make certain that
Iran could never develop a nuclear
weapon.
Listen to the participants in this al-
liance: of course, the United Kingdom,
our longtime ally; France; the Euro-
pean Union; the United States; Ger-
many; Russia and China. They are all
part of this agreement to stop Iran
from developing a nuclear weapon. The
Republicans opposed it to a person, but
the President was able to implement it.
That agreement called for constant
inspection by United Nation’s agen-
cies—nuclear agencies—to make cer-
tain that Iran lived up to the terms of
the treaty and did not develop nuclear
weapons. It worked. The inspectors
came and told us, time and again, there
were no locked doors, there was no de-
nial of entry, no denial of access. They
were able to look behind closed doors
and came to the conclusion that Iran
was complying with the treaty and not
developing nuclear weapons.
Then President Trump announced he
was walking away from this agree-
ment, walking away from this require-
ment under the treaty for neutral in-
spectors to crawl all over Iran and
make sure they were living up to the
terms of the agreement. That was the
beginning of the Trump policy on Iran
that leads us to where we are today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3032 May 22, 2019
President Trump has been pursuing a
provocative and incomprehensible pol-
icy of regime change in Iran, trying at
one moment to flatter and meet with
President Rouhani to negotiate and
then the next moment threatening to
obliterate Iran from the planet. Presi-
dent Trump withdrew from that nu-
clear agreement and tried to starve
Iran of the agreed benefits it was to re-
ceive from that deal.
Let me be clear, there is no doubt
that Iran is responsible for dangerous
conduct around the world, which I will
never approve of, but an Iran with nu-
clear weapons is dramatically more
dangerous than one without. The Presi-
dent doesn’t understand that basic
fact. Why not push back against Iran
without withdrawing from the nuclear
agreement? Why give them the pretext
for belligerence and undermine our
credibility with the global powers that
joined us in that nuclear agreement?
The tragic end result of this Presi-
dent’s incoherent policy in Iran is that
our allies are united against us, and
Iran may restart nuclear activities
within the next few weeks. President
Trump’s policy at the direction of Mr.
Bolton seems to have only increased
regional tensions, incentivized Iran to
restart its nuclear weapons program,
and fomented a pretext for another
Middle Eastern war.
This Congress, too often a
rubberstamp for this President’s worst
behavior, must do more in the next few
weeks and months to stop this effort
based on the briefing we received yes-
terday. Wars are so easy to get into
and so difficult to get out of. When I
hear our advisers, in general terms,
talking about short wars, I think about
Iraq, and I think about Afghanistan
and the fact that, 18 years later, with
gravestones all across the United
States, we are still paying the price for
decisions that were made so long ago.
Let us think twice before we engage in
direct military confrontation with any
country and, certainly, with Iran.
I yield the floor.

ator from Maine.

taining to the introduction of S. 1602

SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I don’t
have a speech prepared. I just want to
share a few thoughts with my col-
leagues. What I am about to say I in-
tend to say gently and constructively,
and that is this: We need to do more.
We need to do more. By ‘‘we,’’ I mean
the U.S. Congress.
We have completed almost 25 percent
of the time allotted to this current
Congress. And what have we done?
Other than nominations, which are im-
portant—and I will come back to
that—we have done nothing—zero,
zilch, nada.
Let me talk about my friends in the
House of Representatives first. I have
great respect for them. I wish I had
served in the House. I would have loved
to have had that experience. So far, our
friends in the House—at least the lead-
ership—have done two things. No. 1,
they have passed bills they know have
not a hope in Hades of passing the U.S.
Senate. We call those bills messaging
bills, as you know. They are not de-
signed for the next generation. They
are designed for the next election.
They don’t do anything to make the
American people any more secure or
improve the quality of their lives, and
we all know that.
The second thing that my friends in
the House leadership have done—and I
say this with all the respect I can mus-
ter—is to harass the President.
Again, I say this gently, and I say
this, hopefully, constructively to my
friends in the House leadership: The
House leadership needs to urinate or
get off the pot. The House leadership
needs to indict the President of the
United States, impeach him, and let us
hold a trial—he will not be convicted—
or they need to go ahead and hold in
contempt every single member of the
Trump administration so we can move
those issues into our court system and
get back to doing the people’s business.
Now, if they decide to go the court
route, I would caution my friends to be
very, very careful because once it en-
ters the court system, it becomes a
zero-sum game. One or two things are
going to happen. Either the adminis-
tration will win, in which case the
oversight authority of the U.S. Con-
gress will be undermined, or the House
leadership will win, in which case no
American with a brain above a single-
cell organism is going to want to run
for President of the United States, be-
cause Congress will be able to find out
everything about your life, even the
most intimate details, whether it is
relevant to your job or not and whether
it happened when you were President
or not.
What I hope happens is that my
friends in the House leadership and the
administration sit down and talk—not
talk like 8-year-olds in the back of a
minivan fighting but talk construc-
tively about how their behavior could
impact important institutions in this
country—and work it out.
I thank the Attorney General for
making overtures to the House leader-
ship to try to find common ground.
Now, let me talk about the Senate.
We need to do more. I am not saying
we haven’t done anything. We have
confirmed some very important nomi-
nees to the Trump administration. It is
long overdue. They are fine men and
women. We have confirmed some very
fine men and women to the Federal Ju-
diciary, and I believe they will make
this country safer and will make this
country better. I am very proud of that
effort. So let me say it again. I am not
saying we have done nothing. I am say-
ing we need to do more.
There are issues where our Demo-
cratic friends and my Republican
friends have more in common than we
don’t. We need to bring the bills to the
floor of the Senate. Everyone has their
own list, and everyone in the Senate
knows what I am talking about, wheth-
er they will say it or not.
What is one of the things that moms
and dads worry about when they lie
down at night and can’t sleep? The cost
of prescription drugs. There is bipar-
tisan support for prescription drug re-
form.
I just read a study in the Journal of
the American Medical Association.
They studied the U.S. healthcare deliv-
ery system and the healthcare delivery
systems of all other wealthy countries.
So it is apples to apples. In America,
we pay about $1,500 for every man,
woman, or child every year for pharma-
ceutical drugs. In the average rich
country, other countries pay $750.
I am not criticizing our pharma-
ceutical drug companies. What they do
is marvelous. We live longer. They save
money. They keep us out of hospitals.
But why is everybody else paying $750
and our people are paying $1,500? There
are things we can do that will help
make the pharmaceutical industry bet-
ter but also help consumers. Do you
know what we are doing about it?
Nothing. We need to bring a bill to the
floor.
I could give you another example. We
all know there needs to be reform of
our National Emergency Act. We know
that. It is not about President Trump.
It is about institutions, checks and bal-
ances, and Madisonian separation of
powers.
We could do something together to
get rid of spam robocalls. I get about 12
a day.
ROB PORTMAN has a great bill that
would end government shutdowns. We
have more in common on that than we
don’t.
We need a supplemental disaster bill.
We have Americans who are hurting. In
my State, after Katrina, we were flat
on our backs. If it hadn’t been for the
American taxpayer, we would have
never risen to our knees, much less to
our feet. We have other Americans and
friends in Puerto Rico who need help.
We ought to be able to work it out.
I could keep going. Everybody has
their own list.
I don’t care whether we move a bill
through committee or whether we
bring a bill directly to the floor of the
Senate—I am in labor, not manage-
ment; that is above my pay grade—but
we need to try. We need to try.
I understand it is an election cycle. I
get that. I say to the Presiding Officer,
I am a politician. You know that. But
we are always in an election cycle.
When are we not in an election cycle?
And I understand some of my col-
leagues with a lot more experience
than I have—and I listen carefully to
them, and I try to listen carefully to
them—are thinking right now: Ken-
nedy, that is just not the way it is done
here.

Well, by God, maybe it is not, but

Maybe we are. Maybe we will win.

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, on
Tuesday, the Washington Post pub-
lished an important piece of investiga-
tive journalism. The journalists looked
into a very narrow, very wealthy group
of special interests seeking to control
our Federal judiciary. It was a reveal-
ing story, one that matters a great
deal to the Senate and to the people we
serve. I come to the floor today to dis-
cuss that tightening special interest
grip on our courts.
The central operative in this court-
fixing scheme is Leonard Leo of the
Federalist Society, the organization at
the center of this effort. As I described
here on the Senate floor several weeks
ago, there are three incarnations of the
Federalist Society.
The first is a debating society for
conservatives at law schools. They con-
vene panels and forums for like-mind-
ed, aspiring lawyers to talk about con-
servative ideas and judicial doctrine.
That is all fine.
The second is a flashy Washington,
DC, think tank. They attract big-name
lawyers, scholars, and politicians—
even Supreme Court Justices—to their
events. They publish and podcast. They
hold black tie galas. I don’t agree with
the work they do, but I don’t question
their right to do it.
The third Federalist Society is what
was exposed in the Post article. It is
something much, much darker, both in
its funding and in its function. It is a
vehicle for powerful interests seeking
to ‘‘reorder’’ the judiciary under their
control so as to benefit their corporate
rightwing purposes. It seeks to accom-
plish by judicial power grab what the
Republican Party has been unable to
accomplish through the open Demo-
cratic process.
This third, dark Federalist Society
understands the fundamental power
through the Federal judiciary to rig
the system in favor of special interests.
So what did the Post find out about
how our judges on the most important
courts in the country are selected? It
found a network of front groups. It
found shell entities with no employees.
It found shared post office mail drops,
common contractors and officers
across nominally separate entities,
even common presidents of nominally
separate entities. In these characteris-
tics, it has some resemblance to money
laundering and crime syndicates.
What else did they find? They found
dark money funders, anonymous adver-
tising, enormous pay packages for the
operatives, and judicial lists prepared
secretly. It found $250 million in dark
money flowing through this apparatus.
The story turns up familiar dark
money political funders like the Mer-
cers and the National Rifle Associa-
tion, but it also exposes groups that
are harder to spot, which may not have
garnered much attention before but
serve central functions in Leonard
Leo’s court-fixing apparatus.
A few weeks ago I delivered remarks
on the Senate floor about the sweeping
influence of Leonard Leo and the Fed-
eralist Society court-fixing scheme. I
touched on one Federalist Society
product of this scheme in particular:
the newly confirmed DC Court of Ap-
peals judge, Neomi Rao. I described
some pretty straightforward facts
about Rao. Her connection to the Fed-
eralist Society is no secret. Sitting on
the DC Circuit right now, her bio still
appears on the Federalist Society
website along with the list of 26 times
she has been featured—26 times she has
been featured at Federalist Society
events.
Before being nominated for one of the
most influential courts in the country,
which some call the second highest
court in the land, she had never been a
judge, she had never tried a case. In-
stead, she had served as the Trump ad-
ministration’s point person for helping
big Republican donors tear down Fed-
eral safety regulations. She did this as
the head of the White House’s Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs,
OIRA. That is not disputed.
Before that, she founded something
provocatively called the Center for the
Study of the Administrative State at
George Mason University’s Antonin
Scalia Law School. Her center is a cog
in Leonard Leo’s machine.
Let’s revisit Rao’s testimony before
the Senate Judiciary Committee about
the funding for the Center for the
Study of the Administrative State. She
testified that neither the Koch Founda-
tion nor any anonymous donors had
funded her center. Well, a trove of doc-
uments obtained by me, the New York
Times, and others showed that was not
true. A Virginia open records request
had revealed that an anonymous donor
funneling its dark money donation
through Leonard Leo and the Charles
Koch Foundation in fact donated $30
million intended to flow to her organi-
zation, her Center for the Study of the
Administrative State.
Well, my remarks drew quite a reac-
tion. The center’s current director
took to Medium to post a 2,500-word re-
buttal. He claimed I was all wrong
about the center’s funding—that none
of its money came from those anony-
mous and Koch brothers’ donations.
The National Review jumped into the
fray and noted the Medium post on its
website. The nub of their criticism was
that although I was right, the Scalia
Law School had indeed received mil-
lions in anonymous and Koch brothers’
money. That money had gone to fund
scholarships, not to the anti-regu-
latory Center for the Study of the Ad-
ministrative State.
Let’s start by assuming that is true.
I will tell you, if I gave $30 million to
my alma mater ‘‘for scholarships,’’ I
would expect a thank-you. I expect
they would see a gift of $30 million in
scholarships as a benefit to the school.
If they were asked ‘‘Has Senator
WHITEHOUSE ever given you a gift?’’ I
would expect them to say ‘‘Yes, he
gave us a $30 million scholarship fund.’’
I might even expect a nice press re-
lease. So I don’t buy the ‘‘this was just
scholarships money’’ dodge around tell-
ing the truth to the Judiciary Com-
mittee.
But look a little more. In 2016,
George Mason University, indeed, re-
ceived a $10 million donation from the
Charles Koch Foundation and, indeed,
did receive a $20 million donation from
an anonymous donor. Both gifts came
with grant agreements, and these grant
agreements were among the Virginia
open records documents. So we can
learn a little bit more.
The grant agreements stipulate that
the money was intended to fund
‘‘scholarships’’ but also specify that
gifts were conditioned on the school’s
providing ‘‘funding . . . and support
for’’—you guessed it—Neomi Rao’s
Center for the Study of the Adminis-
trative State.
That is not all we found. Private
communications revealed with the
grant agreements show that the Koch
Foundation and their handpicked law
school administrators viewed all of this
money as fungible.
I earlier said that if I gave $30 mil-
lion, I might expect a press release.
The Antonin Scalia Law School did a
press release. Its announcement of this
funding stated: ‘‘The scholarship
money will also benefit the institution
because it frees up resources that can
be allocated for other priorities, in-
cluding additional faculty hires and
support for academic programs.’’
It didn’t end there. The documents
keep telling us more. They include a
progress report—a progress report—to
the Koch Foundation. Under the head-
ing ‘‘most pressing needs,’’ Dean Henry
Butler wrote to the Koch Foundation:
‘‘Cash is King (scholarships are cash).’’
In that same memo to the Koch Foun-
dation—which, by the way, is kind of a
bizarre document to exist in the first
place, unless this is kind of a front for
Koch brothers’ political activities—
Dean Butler also made clear that Rao’s
center had indeed received hundreds of
thousands in funding from an anony-
mous donor, just as I charged, and fur-
ther made clear that Rao’s center was

being funded with $400,000 from ‘‘nam-
ing-gifts scholarship revenue’’—the
Koch brothers’ ‘‘scholarships’’ money
that was earmarked for Neomi Rao’s
center. It was being rerouted to fund
Leonard Leo and Neomi Rao’s project
to gut public protections in this coun-
try on behalf of those donors. The dark
plot thickened.
Here is the most interesting part of
all. The open records documents also
show that the law school dean, Henry
Butler, regularly reported to Leonard
Leo on developments at Neomi Rao’s
center, including faculty hiring and
other Federalist Society priorities. The
emails are very cozy. The dean is def-
erential. There is even a calendar entry
for lunch at a Washington, DC, res-
taurant for Neomi Rao, Henry Butler,
and Leonard Leo. Cozier still is that
another condition of the Koch Founda-
tion’s massive gift was that Henry But-
ler be protected as dean because they
viewed him—specifically him—as ‘‘crit-
ical to advancing the school’s mis-
sion.’’ That mission? Doing the Koch
Foundation and Leonard Leo’s bidding
to help cripple public interest protec-
tions in this country for big special in-
terests funding Leo, funding the cen-
ter, and funding the Federalist Society.
Neomi Rao’s defenders were quick to
push back on this point and argued
that my criticisms of her center’s work
was stifling their academic inquiry.
They pointed to the center’s research
roundtables and public policy con-
ferences as evidence of its fair and
independent academic bona fides.
Sorry, but it is tough to buy when, in
one private fundraising email, Dean
Butler was revealed to have asked one
wealthy donor for a $1.5 million gift
‘‘to entice Neomi [Rao] to return home
to Scalia Law after she dismantles the
administrative state.’’
Tell me, who is the real threat to
academic inquiry here?
Perhaps more to the point, now that
she is a judge: Who is a present threat
to judicial independence on the DC Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals?
Fancy lunches and weird, cozy rela-
tionships between public law school
deans and DC power brokers can seem
a bit in the weeds, so let’s not lose
sight of the bigger picture here. This
stuff matters because Americans are
now seeing their courts fill with
judges, like Neomi Rao, who are ex-
pected and chosen to reliably rule for
big corporate and Republican partisan
special interests—the ones funding the
Federalist Society’s selection of these
judges, the ones funding the Judicial
Crisis Network’s confirmation of these
judges, the ones funding Amici, the
front group Amici that shows up to
argue in court.
I recently looked at the numbers for
the Federalist Society-dominated Su-
preme Court. Under Chief Justice Rob-
erts’ tenure, through the end of the Oc-
tober term of 2017 to 2018, Republican
appointees delivered partisan 5-to-4
rulings that favored corporate or Re-
publican partisan special interests, not
three or four times, not even a dozen or
two dozen times, but 73 times. If you
look at the Court’s cases during Chief
Justice Roberts’ tenure and look at the
5-to-4 decisions and look at the 5-to-4
decisions wherein the breakdown be-
tween the five and the four was par-
tisan and look at those 5-to-4 partisan
decisions, for the ones in which there
was a clearly apparent, big Republican
donor interest, you will find that every
single one of those 73 decisions was
won—was decided—in favor of the big
Republican donor interest. There were
73 victories delivered for big Repub-
lican interests with there being no
Democratic appointee who joined the
majority.
Here is one case study—a recent deci-
sion after the 73. It is Lamps Plus v.
Varela. The plaintiff, Frank Varela,
sued his employer, Lamps Plus, after a
company data breach led to a fraudu-
lent tax return being filed in his name.
An appellate court looked at the case
and relied on a State contract principle
to agree with plaintiff Varela. That is
a traditionally conservative principle—
deferring to State laws. Along came
the Supreme Court in this case, and it
ditched the conservative principle to
rule in favor of the corporation in a 5-
to-4 partisan decision.
There is another case study pending
before the Court now—Kisor v. Wilkie.
On its face, Kisor addresses an obscure
administrative law doctrine about judi-
cial deference to Federal Agencies, but
Kisor has been described as a ‘‘stalking
horse for much larger game.’’ The larg-
er purpose is to strip away judicial def-
erence to administrative Agencies’ ca-
pacity to regulate independently in the
public’s interest.
You have to understand that if you
are a mighty corporation, you come to
an administrative Agency from a posi-
tion of terrific advantage ordinarily,
and where administrative Agencies are
willing to stand up, that is important,
but if you can get your judges on a
court and strip away that deference,
now you can put the fix in through the
courts.
Imagine a world in which Federal
Agencies get virtually no judicial def-
erence and in which Leonard Leo’s spe-
cial interest, handpicked judges rule on
Americans’ disputes with big corpora-
tions. If these big special interests are
sick of protections for workers in the
workplace, let the judges get rid of
them. Dismantle the administrative
state. If a big special interest is sick of
safeguards for our air and water or
dangers in toys our children play with,
dismantle the administrative state.
Tear down the safety regulations. They
will have the judges to do that. If cor-
porations are sick of a guardrail that
keeps our financial system from drag-
ging down millions of Americans’ fi-
nancial security, these judges stand
ready to dismantle the administrative
state that protects investors.
Leonard Leo’s dark Federalist Soci-
ety element is installing judges who
are poised to systematically and re-
lentlessly dismantle government Agen-
cies that are sworn to keep us safe and
secure.
How do you push back on this ma-
chine wherein the big-money special
interests select a nominee by contrib-
uting to the Federalist Society and
Leonard Leo’s secretive judicial lists
and judge-picking process? They spend
money campaigning for their selected
judge’s confirmation through the Judi-
cial Crisis Network. They then spend
money through amicus briefs and argue
before the judges on whom they have
spent money to select and confirm.
Sure enough—bingo—it is 73 to 0 in the
important decisions in which they can
get the Republican appointees to gang
up in a group of five and deliver and de-
liver for the interests of the center of
this, which you can’t properly identify
because it is not transparent.
The Federalist Society doesn’t dis-
close its donors. The Judicial Crisis
Network doesn’t disclose its donors.
The Supreme Court rule doesn’t get at
who the real donors are to this phony
front group, Amici. You find out later
on who the winners are—73 to nothing.
How do you push back on that ma-
chine? You push back with sunlight,
with transparency. We must have
transparency in our campaign finance
system. We must have transparency in
this special interest conveyor belt that
is filling our courts. We should also
have transparency in the courts. Right
now, the dark money-funded front
groups behind Leonard Leo and behind
the Federalist Society’s judge-picking
operation are probably also behind
those amicus briefs. With a little trans-
parency, we would know. It is through
these amicus briefs that the judges who
were selected and confirmed by these
folks get instructed on how they
should rule. This is a recipe for corrup-
tion.
The Court itself should require real
transparency from so-called friends of
the Court. These amicus groups come
in under a Supreme Court rule. The Su-
preme Court rule only requires them to
disclose who paid for the brief. Yet who
is really behind the group? We don’t
know. The Supreme Court could cor-
rect that. It could correct it like that,
but then it would start to expose who
is here.
If the Court will not, Congress must.
Democracy dies in darkness, it has
been said, and so does judicial inde-
pendence. The American people deserve
to know when powerful special inter-
ests are paying to sway Federal judges
with self-serving legal advice. If those
same interests paid to get those judges
selected and paid to campaign for their
confirmations and then paid to have
the amicus briefs put before the Court,
the need for the American people to
understand what is going on becomes
even more profound.
I close with a big thank-you to the
Washington Post for its reporting.
Thanks to its careful investigative
work of its pouring through tax records
and interviews, we now know a lot

more about the Federalist Society’s
court-fixing operation.
Our President likes to describe inves-
tigative journalism that pokes and
probes at the mischief of his adminis-
tration as fake news. There is nothing
fake about this news. This is in the
best traditions of investigative jour-
nalism, and I am grateful for its work

captured by corporations and runaway
partisanship that is fueled by dark
money.

ator from Wisconsin.
HEALTHCARE
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise
today to speak about the ongoing
threat from the Trump administration
to healthcare and the guaranteed pro-
tections that millions of American
families depend upon.
President Trump has tried to pass re-
peal plans that would take people’s
healthcare away and allow insurance
companies to charge more for people
with preexisting health conditions or
those insurance companies could deny
them coverage altogether.
When that repeal plan failed to pass
in the Senate in the summer of 2017, in-
stead of working in a bipartisan way to
lower healthcare costs, President
Trump turned to truly sabotaging our
healthcare system.
What do I mean by that?
The Trump administration made it
harder for people to sign up for the Af-
fordable Care Act coverage. They have
done so by limiting the window of time
when people can enroll. They have
truly created instability in the
healthcare market, and their sabotage
has contributed to premium spikes
that we have seen across the country,
including in my home State of Wis-
consin.
The Trump administration has even
gone to court to support a lawsuit in
order to overturn the Affordable Care
Act completely, and that, of course,
would include protections for people
with preexisting health conditions.
They have essentially gone into court
to ask the court to strike down the Af-
fordable Care Act. Now, if they were to
succeed, insurance companies will
again be able to deny coverage or
charge much higher premiums for the
more than 130 million Americans who
have some sort of preexisting health
condition. The number with pre-
existing health conditions includes
some 2 million Wisconsinites.
What is the President’s plan to pro-
tect people with preexisting health
conditions? He doesn’t have one, and I
don’t believe he ever will.
In fact, he has acted in just the oppo-
site vein. This administration has ex-
panded junk insurance plans that can
deny coverage to people with pre-
existing conditions, and they don’t
have to cover essential services like
prescription drugs or emergency room
care or maternity care.
I ask my friends on the other side of
the aisle to think about this for a mo-
ment. President Trump supports over-
turning the law that provides protec-
tions for people with preexisting health
conditions at the same time he is ex-
panding these junk plans that don’t
provide those very protections. If this
isn’t straight-up sabotage, I really
don’t know what is.
When I was 9 years old, I got sick. I
was really sick. I was in the hospital
for 3 months. Now, I recovered, but my
family still struggled because I had
been branded with the words ‘‘pre-
existing health condition’’ and I was
denied insurance coverage.
That family and personal experience
has driven my fight to make sure that
every American has affordable and
quality healthcare coverage.
Today, because of the Affordable
Care Act, those with preexisting health
conditions cannot be discriminated
against. They can’t be denied
healthcare coverage, and they can’t be
charged discriminatory premiums.
I want to protect the guaranteed
healthcare protections that so many
millions of Americans now depend
upon. I have introduced legislation
along with my colleague Senator DOUG
JONES of Alabama to overturn the
Trump administration’s expansion of
junk insurance plans.
The entire Senate Democratic cau-
cus, including the two Independents
who caucus with us, have supported
this legislation. They have signed on to
this bill. The Nation’s top healthcare
organizations, representing tens of
thousands of doctors and physicians,
and patients and medical students, and
other health experts have supported
this legislation and endorsed it. Any-
one who says they support healthcare
coverage for people with preexisting
conditions should support my legisla-
tion.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1556
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee be discharged from
further consideration of S. 1556; that
the Senate proceed to its immediate
consideration; that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table,
with no intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the
right to object, this is the latest Demo-
cratic attempt to raise the cost of
healthcare paid for out of your own
pocket by taking away an ability to
provide lower cost health insurance
that preserves preexisting condition
protection and the essential health
benefits. These short-term health bene-
fits were available under President
Clinton. They were available under
President Bush. They were available
under President Obama right until the
last few months of his office, when he
cut them down to 3 months long.
President Trump has simply said
that you may now have them up to a
year and renew them for 3 years. If you
live in Fulton County, GA, your insur-
ance costs will be 30 percent less
against the typical ObamaCare bronze
plan and even more against the silver
plan.
This is the latest Democratic at-
tempt to increase the cost of what you
pay for healthcare out of your own
pocket. Their next attempt will be
Medicare for All, which, if you have
health insurance on the job, will take
that health insurance away.
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Wisconsin.
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I am
certainly disappointed that my Repub-
lican colleagues have chosen to object
to protecting people with preexisting
conditions.
It is my contention that some of the
very opposite impacts, because of these
junk plans, are occurring than what
my colleague has recited. In fact, I
hardly consider them insurance plans.
Many have argued that they are not
worth the paper that they are written
on. They don’t cover many essential
benefits. They are not required to
cover people with preexisting health
conditions. They can drop people. They
can charge outrageous prices. What we
found—and the reason that the Obama
administration went from yearlong
plans to 3-month plans—is that they
saw the distortion in the markets.
They saw that people who had believed
that they might not get sick—healthy,
often younger people—were availing
themselves of these plans, making the
Affordable Care——
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
will the Senator yield for a question?
Ms. BALDWIN. I would yield to one
question, and then I want to wrap up
my comments.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, is
the Senator of Wisconsin not aware
that the short-term healthcare plans
do not change the law of preexisting
condition?
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, these
short-term plans do not have to cover
preexisting conditions. I can tell you,
as I have inquired—
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
may I——
Ms. BALDWIN. I yielded already for
a question. But I want to say——
Mr. ALEXANDER. She gave the
wrong answer, Mr. President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin has the floor.
Ms. BALDWIN. It may not be to the
Senator’s liking, but I was going to tell
you about the plans that I read the fine
print on from the State of Wisconsin.
Now that these short-term plans are
renewable for up to 3 years, in these
junk plans, you can see the fine print.
Many times they start with this: We
will not cover a preexisting condition.
Every single one of them refuses to
cover maternity care. That means none
of these junk plans cover that essential
benefit. Most of them don’t cover

emergency room care. Most of them
don’t cover prescription drugs. So re-
gardless of how the law impacts people
who have other types of insurance, I
feel strongly that these junk plans are
very distorting of the market and not
worth the paper they are written on for
those who have chosen to take that
route.
Last fall, we heard all my colleagues
across the aisle say, often repeatedly,
that they support protections for peo-
ple with preexisting health conditions.
Today I just offered an opportunity for
Democrats and Republicans to come
together to protect people’s access to
quality, affordable healthcare when
they need it the most, but there was an
objection.
I say to the American people that we
must not lose sight of the fight right in
front of us. We have a President who
time after time has sabotaged our
healthcare system, raised healthcare
costs, and pushed these junk insurance
plans that don’t have to cover people
with preexisting conditions. We have
an administration that is asking a
court to strike down the Affordable
Care Act and its protections for people
with preexisting conditions in their en-
tirety.
The choice for the American people
could not be more clear. We want to
make things better, and my Republican
colleagues refuse to join us in this ef-
fort, which would be to prevent this ad-
ministration from making things
worse.
I yield the floor.

ator from Connecticut.
PROTECTING AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING
CONDITIONS ACT OF 2019
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, the
House recently passed a piece of legis-
lation called the Protecting Americans
with Preexisting Conditions Act. The
substance of this legislation would pre-
vent a Trump administration rule from
going into effect that would allow for
States to license the kind of insurance
plans that Senator BALDWIN was refer-
ring to. These are plans that do not
cover preexisting conditions or the es-
sential healthcare benefits.
I am going to offer right now a unan-
imous consent request to proceed to
immediate consideration of this bill. I
suspect it will be objected to. After an
opportunity for Republicans to object,
I will speak to the merits of this legis-
lation. So let me start with a request
to bring this legislation that will pro-
tect people with preexisting conditions
and the essential healthcare benefits to
the floor.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 986
Mr. President, my motion is as such:
As if in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed
to the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 90, H.R. 986, Protecting
Americans with Preexisting Conditions
Act of 2019; that the bill be considered
read a third time and passed; and that
the motion to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no
intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, re-
serving my right to object, section 1332
is the innovation waiver that is part of
the Affordable Care Act, passed by the
Democratic majority. That act in-
cludes protection for preexisting condi-
tions. Using the flexibility granted
under section 1332 does not change any-
thing about preexisting conditions. So
it is misleading to the American people
to suggest that it does.
This is another Democratic attempt
to make it more expensive, to cost
more for what you pay for healthcare
out of your own pocket by taking away
flexibility from the States to find a
less expensive way for you to afford
healthcare and, at the same time, not
changing the preexisting condition pro-
tection that is provided by the Afford-
able Care Act. This is the latest at-
tempt to do it, but the boldest attempt
to raise the cost of your healthcare is
Medicare for All, which if you have in-
surance on the job, as 181 million
Americans do, would take that insur-
ance away from you.
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Mr. MURPHY. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. Again, I share in Senator BALD-
WIN’s disappointment that we can’t
move immediately to this legislation.
This isn’t a political game. These are
individuals all across the country who
are relying on us to make sure that
they are not subject to the abuses of
the market. They are relying on us to
make sure we don’t return to the days
in which insurance companies could
prevent you from getting healthcare
simply because you were sick or return
to the days when you bought an insur-
ance product and then it didn’t turn
out to ultimately be insurance.
Let’s be clear. The waiver that the
President has allowed States to take
advantage of would absolutely—it
would by definition of the rule—allow
for States to waive the preexisting con-
dition requirement. The rule itself says
that the innovation that happens at
the State level does not have to comply
with the essential healthcare benefits
requirement. It says in the rule that
you do not have to comply with pre-
existing conditions requirements. That
is the reason that they are so cheap. So
I am at a loss as to why we have Re-
publicans on the floor saying that pre-
existing conditions will be protected
under this rule. That is not true. The
rule says that States do not have to
comply with the preexisting require-
ment. It says that States do not have
to cover essential healthcare benefits.
That is why these junk plans are at-
tractive, because they aren’t actually
insurance, and they are only insurance
for people who are at the time very
healthy.
We have to get on the same page
here. We have to be reading from the
same script. The fact of the matter is,
the definition of the rule allows for
protections for people with preexisting
conditions to be discriminated against.
I am sorry that we weren’t able to
bring up this piece of legislation be-
cause healthcare insurance should be
healthcare insurance. And what we
worry about are two things. First is
that by allowing for the marketing of
these junk plans, you are going to have
all sorts of people who today aren’t
sick jumping into those plans, coming
off of the plans that protect people
with preexisting conditions. The people
who are going to be left behind on
those regulated plans are people who
are sick, people who have preexisting
conditions. So you are, all of a sudden,
bifurcating the insurance market. You
are going to have a market for people
who are currently healthy, and then
you are going to have a market for peo-
ple who are sick or have ever had a pre-
existing condition.
You do not have to be an actuary and
you don’t have to have taken classes in
healthcare insurance economics to
know that when that happens, rates
skyrocket for people who have a pre-
existing condition—for the millions of
people around this country who have
had a serious diagnosis at some point
during their life.
So as you sell these junk plans, there
is no way but for costs to go up. That
is on top of the increases we saw last
year. Last year, insurance companies
priced in the costs of Trump adminis-
tration sabotage. They priced into
their premiums the attacks on our
healthcare system from the Republican
Congress.
In many States, we saw insurance
plans pushing 60 percent, 40 percent,
and, in some cases, 80 percent increases
in premiums. Now on top of that, for
sick people, for people with preexisting
conditions, the rates are going to be
even bigger because of the flight of
those without preexisting conditions
into marketplaces set up specifically
for them.
The second thing we worry about is
that these junk plans market them-
selves as insurance, but they aren’t.
Here is a list of things that I would
generally consider to be covered under
my insurance plan.
If I bought an insurance plan, if I
handed over a check to the insurance
company, I kind of think that if I go to
the emergency room, I am not going to
have to pay for it out of my pocket. I
am thinking to myself: Well, you know
what, if I need prescription drugs, they
are going to cover some of that. Well,
if I have a mental health diagnosis,
doesn’t insurance cover my head as
well as the rest of my body?
These are the things that I would as-
sume that insurance covers, but these
junk plans don’t cover these things.
Junk plans do not cover trips to the
emergency room. Junk plans often
don’t cover hospitalizations. They
don’t cover prescription drugs. Almost
none of them cover maternity care.
Your checkups might not be covered

under a junk plan. Preexisting condi-
tions will cost you more. Contracep-
tion isn’t going to be in lots of these
plans. They are not required to cover
lab services or pediatrics. Mental
health isn’t going to be in many of
these junk plans. As for rehab services,
if you get injured, you are not going to
find those in some of these plans. And
if you have a chronic disease, there is
nothing in the law that requires treat-
ment for those to be covered.
So all of a sudden, as for the things
you thought insurance covered, they
don’t cover it, and you have been pay-
ing a premium for years. Then, when
you finally need access to the system,
it is not there. That is what these plans
can do. That is what the law and the
Trump administration rule allows
States to license as insurance. And
that is why we are on the floor today,
to ask—to plead—to our colleagues to
bring legislation before this body, ei-
ther Senator BALDWIN’s legislation or
Representative KUSTER’s legislation
that has already passed the House, that
would stop these junk insurance plans
from being sold all around this coun-
try, which will trick many Americans
into believing they have insurance
when they don’t and will dramatically
raise the cost of care potentially in
many States for people who have seri-
ous preexisting conditions.
I am not surprised at the objection to
both of our unanimous consent re-
quests. Nevertheless, I am disappointed
in it. We will continue to be down here
on the floor for as much time as it
takes to try to rally the whole of this
body to protect people with preexisting
conditions, to fight back against the
sabotage of the Affordable Care Act
and the healthcare system by this
President. Hopefully, one day we will
be successful.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am
proud to be here on the floor today to
join with Senator BALDWIN and Senator
JONES on their resolution with Senator
MURPHY. I have to say to Senator MUR-
PHY, before he puts that down, I have
to look at that list and tell you that,
before the Affordable Care Act, I would
get calls like this, and I am sure you
did, too.
Someone calls me and would say: I
paid into healthcare all my life and
never gotten sick, and then I finally
needed surgery. What do you mean it
only pays for 1 day in the hospital?
Well, it never paid for more than 1 day
in the hospital, but they didn’t know it
because they didn’t get sick.
So folks buy the junk plans—and
thank you for the list—but they buy
the junk plan being healthy and then
will never know that it doesn’t cover
those things unless they get sick. When
they find out, it will be too late.
So that is why we are here because
we know that healthcare isn’t polit-
ical. It shouldn’t be political. It is per-
sonal for every one of us. It is personal
for ourselves and our families. It af-
fects all of us, whether we are Demo-
crats, Republicans, Independents, vote,
don’t vote, urban, rural from any State
in the Union.
In fact, when people tell me their
healthcare stories, they don’t start by
telling me their political affiliation.
They talk to me about what has hap-
pened to them, what has happened to
their mom and dad, what has happened
to their children. Political affiliation
doesn’t matter.
People in Michigan simply want to
know that the healthcare they depend
on will be there for them and be afford-
able for them and their family today
and into the future, and that is the
fight that we have as Democrats. We
will continue that fight.
Unfortunately, they have reason to
be worried about the rise of short-term,
limited duration insurance plans. They
should be worried about what these
plans don’t cover—junk plans, as we
are calling them. As Senator BALDWIN
said so well, they are junk. They don’t
really cover anything. They make you
feel good, as long as you are healthy,
that you have got insurance, but then
you find out, when you get sick, that
your child is not covered or you are not
covered.
The fact many of these plans are
medically underwritten, which means
that the insurance company—by the
way, junk plans are about putting deci-
sions back in the hands of the insur-
ance company, instead of you knowing
that you and your doctor can decide
what you need and that it will be cov-
ered. The insurance companies can
charge whatever they want based on
somebody’s health, gender, age, or
other status.
Remember when being a woman was
considered a preexisting condition? I
do. These plans are bringing that back.
One recent study found that none of
these plans that have been approved by
the Trump administration so far cover
maternity care—none of them. We
fought hard—I fought hard—as a mem-
ber of the Finance Committee to make
sure that women’s healthcare and ma-
ternity care were covered. Our
healthcare is as basic a healthcare as
any man’s healthcare and ought to be
covered the same.
I want to repeat this. We have a ma-
ternal health crisis in this country,
and the administration is pushing
plans that don’t cover basic coverage
for women. On top of that, these junk
plans can exclude people with pre-
existing conditions—yes, they can—and
impose yearly or lifetime caps on care.
Remember when you had to worry
about how many cancer treatments the
insurance company would pay for?
Now, there aren’t caps so that you can
decide and your doctor can decide with
you on what it takes to put you in re-
mission and put you on a healthy path.
It is estimated about half of Michigan
families include somebody with a pre-
existing condition—about half—with
everything from heart disease to asth-
ma to arthritis. I met with some of
them earlier this month during the Na-
tional Brain Tumor Society’s Head to
the Hill event.
Tiffany, who is from Livonia, was
just 17 years old when she was diag-
nosed with a brain tumor. Since then,
her tumor has reoccurred six times.
She has been through seven surgeries,
chemotherapy, and radiation treat-
ments. The location of her tumor
means that Tiffany has also lost some
of the use of her left arm and hand. Tif-
fany doesn’t have a choice. Her life de-
pends on having comprehensive health
insurance. Unfortunately, that kind of
insurance is getting less and less af-
fordable.
So when our Republican colleagues
come to the floor and say that we just
want to raise prices, let me tell you
what has really happened in the last
year. The sabotage by the Trump ad-
ministration, the unravelling of the Af-
fordable Care Act, the junk plans, now
the instability and going into court to
try to totally repeal the Affordable
Care Act, all of that instability—every-
thing that has been done—means that
comprehensive health insurance costs
have gone up 16.6 percent this year, so
somebody buying insurance is paying
an average 16.6 percent more than they
did last year because of all of this ef-
fort to sabotage, undermine, and un-
ravel the healthcare system.
Tiffany should be able to focus on
getting the treatment she needs and
living her best life possible, not how
she will pay for the insurance she
needs. We all know Tiffany isn’t alone.
It is estimated that 130 million people
in our country are living with pre-
existing conditions—130 million people.
That is 130 million people who could be
hurt either directly or indirectly by
these short-term junk plans.
Two weeks ago, I had the chance to
speak at the Detroit Race for the Cure,
which raises money for breast cancer
research and services. As I stood on the
stage and looked out at over 10,000 peo-
ple, a lot of beautiful pink all sur-
rounding us in downtown Detroit, I saw
people with preexisting conditions. One
woman, who was standing on the stage
near me, asked me the question: Why is
it that I have to worry about whether
or not I will be able to get insurance in
the future? Why do I have to worry
about that?
She added: Why don’t President
Trump and other Republicans under-
stand this is my life?
It is not political for her. It is per-
sonal. It is her life. I think that is a
very good question: Why don’t Repub-
licans understand that people like Tif-
fany and those women in pink deserve
healthcare protections?
Protecting people with preexisting
conditions isn’t about politics. It is
about saving lives. I urge my col-
leagues to support this commonsense
legislation and the efforts of Senator
BALDWIN and JONES.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3038 May 22, 2019
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
Mr. President, I want to take an ad-
ditional moment to talk about a sec-
ond issue that is about saving lives.
For almost 25 years, the Violence
Against Women Act has helped prevent
domestic violence and provide sur-
vivors with the things they need to
build a better life for themselves and
their families. This important piece of
legislation is now expired.
The House passed a VAWA—Violence
Against Women’s Reauthorization bill
48 days ago and sent it to us. It con-
tained important updates to protect
people from violent dating partners
and stalkers, and it helps restore Trib-
al jurisdiction over certain crimes
committed on Tribal lands.
Unfortunately, just as in the case of
junk insurance plans, we have seen no
action on this floor—no action—by the
majority leader. I think, in fact, it has
been over 2 months since we have had
actual legislation and votes on legisla-
tion that would solve problems and ad-
dress concerns of the American people.
It has been 48 days since the House of
Representatives sent us a bill to con-
tinue support and funding for domestic
violence shelters and other important
support.
Well, people with preexisting condi-
tions have waited long enough. Sur-
vivors of domestic violence have wait-
ed long enough. People whose lives are
being threatened by violent dating
partners or stalkers have waited long
enough.
Here is my question for the Senate
majority leader: What are you waiting
for?
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRUZ). The clerk will call the roll.
The assistant bill clerk proceeded to

ator from North Carolina.
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unan-

TRADE
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am
here on the floor today to talk about
international trade. It is a very com-
plex issue, but also a really important
issue to our country. Our goal with
trade should be pretty simple: It is to
level the playing field for America’s
workers, America’s farmers, and Amer-
ica’s businesses.
One, we have got to be sure they are
not hurt by unfair imports coming into
our country, so that is really a fairness
issue and a trade enforcement issue.
Second, we should expand our ex-
ports. Opening up more foreign mar-
kets to our products is great for Amer-
ica. That is the balance. As a trade
lawyer and as the U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative in the George W. Bush ad-
ministration and as a member of the
Finance Committee, which has juris-
diction over these issues, I have
worked on the trade matters quite a
bit. It is really important to my home
State.
Ohio has products that are manufac-
tured by workers and crops grown by
our farmers that are shipped all around
the world. In fact, in Ohio, 1 of every 3
acres is now planted for export. So our
farmers are dependent on trade, and 25
percent of our factory workers—manu-
facturing workers—have their jobs be-
cause of exports. Twenty-five percent
is a big part of our manufacturing
economy.
These jobs aren’t just good for Ohio’s
economy. They are great for the people
that have them. Trade jobs pay, on av-
erage, 16 percent more than other jobs,
and they have better benefits, so we
want more of these jobs.
With 95 percent of the world’s popu-
lation living outside of our country, we
want to sell more of our stuff to the
rest of the world to continue to grow
and maximize the potential of our
economy. So in my State and a lot of
others, manufacturing and ag jobs that
are the bedrock of our economy depend
on balanced trade. That goes for our
trading partners around the world, but
particularly for our two biggest neigh-
bors: Mexico and Canada. They are, by
far, Ohio’s biggest trading partners.
Since 1994, we have linked our econ-
omy to Mexico and Canada in the form
of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA. In 2018, Ohio
shipped 39 percent of our exports to
Canada, more than twice the national
average. Along with our trade with
Mexico, this accounted for $20 billion
in trade. In all, trade with Mexico and
Canada now supports 450,000 jobs in
Ohio. So it is important.
We all know that the existing agree-
ment—again, called NAFTA—has to be
updated. It is 26 years old. It needs to
be modernized. It needs to be improved.
We need to be sure that we are doing a
better job of leveling that playing field
that we talked about and be sure that
we are reflecting the nature of the 21st
century economy.
Think about it. Back when NAFTA
was negotiated, there was no digital
economy. So we need to have new rules
with regard to digital economy, as we
do in our more recent trade agree-
ments.
Also, as an example, there were no
biologics. So we have no protections in
the NAFTA agreement for biological
pharmaceuticals. Of course, we need to
have that in the new agreement, but it
is more than that. Labor standards and
environmental standards that have
been in all of the more recent trade
agreements need to be incorporated
into the NAFTA agreement. There are
lots of reasons for us to update the
North American Free Trade Agreement
and to improve it. Although no trade
agreement is perfect, the new USMCA
does those things.
By the way, according to a recent
study by the Independent Trade Com-
mission, the new USMCA, which is
used to replace NAFTA, is estimated to
raise wages and add 176,000 jobs to the
U.S. economy. That is good. I support
this U.S.-Canada agreement, or
USMCA.
Last week, President Trump and his
administration took a major step to-
ward realizing the USMCA by announc-
ing they would be lifting the so-called
section 232 steel tariffs on steel and
aluminum coming from Mexico and
Canada. This is really good news. It is
something I had advocated for, as had
others, in order for us to pass the
USMCA here but also to be sure that
other countries—Canada and Mexico—
could ratify the USMCA.
It ends the retaliation by Mexico and
Canada on Made in Ohio exports to our
northern and southern neighbors. This
was really starting to bite in my home
State and around the country.

countries like Mexico and Canada and
then being shipped or sneaked into the
United States. You don’t want that.
That protection is in there as well. I
think this was a good agreement.
Tariffs, especially on our allies,
ought to be something we try to
avoid—used tactically, sparingly, and
targeted as to when we are going to use
them.
There has been a lot of talk recently
about the use of these section 232 tar-
iffs by the administration not just on
steel and aluminum but also with re-
gard to automobiles and auto parts.
Section 232, the law that this will be
done under, is really an exception to
our trade laws. Our trade laws say that
if you unfairly trade with us—in other
words, if you subsidize your products
overseas or if you dump them, mean-
ing, you sell them below their cost—
then that is illegal, and we get to re-
taliate by adding tariffs to your prod-
uct.
We also have laws that say if there is
an import surge that domestic indus-
tries are substantially harmed by, that
is a time for us to step up. But our
other trade laws require one of those
two things: either a finding of injury to
a U.S. industry or some kind of unfair
trade.
Under section 232, which is an excep-
tion to that, you don’t have to do that.
You can block imports simply by say-
ing it is a national security issue.
It is a pretty powerful thing that the
executive branch has, but it has been
used very infrequently, and that is how
Congress intended it. Congress in-
tended it just to be used for true na-
tional security purposes.
The agency in charge of investigating
these 232 tariffs is the Commerce De-
partment. A recent Commerce Depart-
ment investigation concluded that im-
ported automobiles under the 232 cri-
teria would be a national security
threat. I think that is not accurate. I
think minivans from Canada, as an ex-
ample, aren’t a national security
threat to us. It may be that if they are
unfairly traded, then we should enforce
our trade laws. It may be that if there
is an import surge that hurts our do-
mestic industry, then go after them.
But I think to use this tool in that sort
of way is not appropriate.
That is why, over the past 50 years
since this has been in effect, the sec-
tion 232 tool has been used only a few
times. In fact, it hasn’t been used in
the last 33 years.
One President tried to use it—George
W. Bush, for whom I worked—and his
Commerce Department said: You know,
that is not a national security issue.
So he used another trade provision
that, again, required that you showed
material injury to a domestic industry.
That is the 232 issue.
I think it is important to have the
tool. I think if it is a true national se-
curity concern, it is good to have it in
the toolbox, and we ought to be able to
use it. But we have to be judicious
about it and not misuse it.
One reason to be careful is if you
were to impose tariffs on cars and
automobiles, as the Commerce Depart-
ment has said you could do, it would
really cost U.S. consumers and busi-
nesses.
First, on average, U.S. cars would
cost about $2,000 more, and I am told
that is a conservative estimate. We
don’t want that.
Second, if you put these 232 tariffs on
cars and auto parts with no fairness ra-
tionale, the retaliatory tariffs on our
exports would be swift and painful.
Finally, if you misuse this 232 tool, I
think you risk losing it altogether.
The World Trade Organization might
not have too much influence these
days, but they do have the ability to
say whether something is legal under
international trade rules. They have an
exception for these national security
waivers, but not if they are misused.
So I think we have to be careful about
how we use it.
President Trump and his administra-
tion made a decision over the last sev-
eral days that I applaud them for. They
decided not to move forward on these
232 tariffs against auto parts and auto-
mobiles. They decided to put it off for
6 months. I commend them for that.
Again, I hope we would never go
there, but I think it is really important
that we put that off for 6 months so
that we can get not just the U.S.-Can-
ada-Mexico agreement accomplished
but so that we can also focus on other
things, specifically, our issues with
China.
I recently introduced a bipartisan
bill on section 232. It is a commonsense
approach that says: Let’s be sure we
are going under the original intent of
section 232, that we are not misusing
it. It is really simple. It says that in-
stead of having the Department of
Commerce make the decision, it should
be the Department of Defense. The De-
partment of Defense has the expertise
to determine whether something is a
national security issue.
With regard to the recent decisions
on these 232 tariffs, the Department of
Defense did not agree with the Com-
merce Department and thought that it
was not a national security concern.
They said that explicitly with regard
to steel and aluminum, as examples. I
just think the men and women who are
hired to protect our country ought to
be the ones who decide whether that is
a national security threat.
Second, our legislation increases
Congress’s oversight here and allows
for Congress to have an expanded role,
to provide a legislative path for Con-
gress to disapprove one of these 232 tar-
iffs decisions if we think it is the
wrong way to go. I think it is impor-
tant to bring some of the power back
to Congress, where it resides in the
Constitution.
I hope my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle will help us with this com-
monsense legislation and avoid the
misuse of section 232 on issues like
autos and auto parts.
Again, in the meantime, the adminis-
tration has made the right choice by
delaying the imposition of these 232
tariffs on longtime allies with regard
to autos and auto parts.
As I said earlier, balanced trade is
about enforcement, being sure that it
is fair in terms of what imports are
coming into this country for our work-
ers, for our farmers, and for our service
providers.
It is also about exports. Do you know
what? Because of that goal of balanced
trade, I support what the Trump ad-
ministration is doing vis-a-vis China.
Unfortunately, when you look at what
has happened to our relationship with
China, we have more and more reasons
to say that China is not playing by the
rules.
China needs to make structural
changes in our trade relationship in
order for us to have that level playing
field we talked about earlier. Right
now, this U.S.-China economic rela-
tionship lacks equity, balance, and
fairness. It also lacks durability.
The big trade deficits and the struc-
tural problems we have can’t last. To
put it simply, China is not playing by
the rules.
First, they unfairly subsidized their
exports. We talked about this earlier,
but it is not fair for another country to
say ‘‘We are going to use government
money to subsidize what we send to the
United States,’’ and then have our
workers and our farmers have to com-
pete with that. Subsidies are unfair
under international rules and under
our trade laws.
China does it in a number of ways.
One, they have a bunch of State-owned
enterprises, and they have actually ex-
panded their State-owned enterprises
at a time when it looked as though
China was going the other way, that
they were going to have a more mar-
ket-based economy, where the govern-
ment wouldn’t be controlling indus-
tries. But they have also committed
massive subsidies to some of their fa-
vorite industries, companies, and tech-
nologies.
Second, China doesn’t grant recip-
rocal access to U.S. investors and en-
gages in coerced technology transfer in
intellectual property theft from U.S.
companies. Often, that intellectual
property or technology then goes to a
Chinese company.
To be clear, as a condition of doing
business in the huge Chinese market,
U.S. companies regularly have to hand
over their intellectual property, their
technology, and their innovations, like
manufacturing processes, let’s say, or
blueprints, designs, trade secrets, and
other things of value. Then, typically,
a Chinese competitor uses these advan-
tages to compete against U.S. compa-
nies. Again, that is just not acceptable.
I encourage you to check out the ad-
ministration’s section 301 report on
USTR.gov. Go on USTR.gov, and you
will see the section 301 issues that are
laid out in that report. If you want to
learn more about it, it is pretty clear.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3041
May 22, 2019
Let me give you an example of how
this technology transfer works. If a
U.S. automaker wants to make cars in
China—and a lot of them have wanted
to and have made them there—China
requires joint ventures in order to gain
access to production technology that
then helps foster China’s own domestic
auto industry.
In a number of businesses, China re-
quires a 51-percent Chinese partner in a
joint venture. Again, that is one way
that technology transfer happens.
At first, China’s foreign investment
catalogue encouraged—that was the
word—foreign auto investment. I was
in China back in 1984, I believe it was—
maybe 1985—at a Jeep plant. And I
watched the first American vehicles go
off the production line in China. I was
there. I saw it. It was very positive.
People were thinking: This is inter-
esting. We are going to do business
with China. Those Jeeps can then be
sold in China and sold in other parts of
Asia. It wasn’t going to compete with
the U.S. market. This was good for
Jeep and good for China. That was at a
time when they were encouraging for-
eign auto investment. But as China
learned about auto manufacturing
from these investments—in other
words, they got knowledge about how
to manufacture automobiles them-
selves—the foreign investment cata-
logue changed its position on auto in-
vestment from ‘‘encouraged’’ to ‘‘per-
mitted’’ and then, more recently, in
2015, to ‘‘restricted.’’
Again, this is an evolution, initially,
bringing in a joint venture partner and
getting the technology. It goes from
‘‘encouraged’’ to ‘‘permitted’’ and then
finally to ‘‘restricted’’ now that China
has that technology. That is kind of
leapfrogging us, isn’t it? Again, that
doesn’t seem fair, and it certainly is
not reciprocal because we don’t do the
same thing here in this country.
This problem of fueling Chinese inno-
vation with the hard work of U.S. com-
panies is even more pronounced in the
electric vehicle sector. There, China
tries to incentivize the production of
vehicles in China rather than imports
from overseas. We would love to sell
American electric cars in China, but
they prevent this with a combination
of things: tariffs, which are relatively
high; subsidies for domestically pro-
duced electric cars; and a credit system
that requires all automakers selling in
China to produce a portion of their
electric vehicles in China or face pen-
alties. Again, we don’t do that.
It is clear from this experience that
China’s unfair trade practices are at
odds with the current rules-based, mul-
tilateral trading system.
I will continue to support the admin-
istration’s efforts to increase pressure
on China in order to reach a strong but
fair and enforceable agreement. I argue
that this is in China’s interest, as well
as in our interest. They are now a ma-
ture trading partner. They are now the
greatest exporter in the world. They
have an economy that is growing—
again, more sophisticated, more tech-
nology. They should want to protect
their own intellectual property. They
should want to be engaging with us and
other countries around the world on a
more fair basis.
While I urge the United States to
hang tough, the administration should
work quickly to try to bring these ne-
gotiations to a close because a com-
bination of the retaliatory tariffs on
U.S. exports and tariffs on Chinese con-
sumer products here in America is
causing pain for our farmers, for our
workers, and for our service providers.
So it would be good to bring these ne-
gotiations to a conclusion.
We were very close to doing that only
a few weeks ago, and the reports back
were that China had changed its view
on some of the concessions they were
willing to make. Let’s get back to the
table, and let’s make a fair and en-
forceable agreement.
As part of increasing pressure on
China, as the new tariff increases are
designed to do, the United States must
also better leverage our allies. The Eu-
ropean Union, Japan, Korea, Canada,
Australia, not to mention Vietnam and
lots of other countries in Southeast
Asia—all share our concerns that the
administration has raised with regard
to China. They are all experiencing the
same thing. Leveraging our allies helps
put pressure on China by dem-
onstrating the broad consensus that
exists among those who believe China
often acts contrary to our rules-based,
multilateral trading system.
When I was U.S. Trade Representa-
tive, I laid the groundwork for a num-
ber of successful World Trade Organiza-
tion complaints against China by
working with our allies. Key to our vic-
tory in those cases was our ability to
rally and to kind of come up with a
posse—the EU, Canada, Mexico, Japan,
and other countries—to show China
that the world was watching and cared.
The administration’s work with the EU
and Japan on WTO reform and sub-
sidies, right now, is a good step in the
right direction. It shows how much is
possible when we can rely on our
friends and, therefore, gain more lever-
age. It is why it is important we don’t
adopt policies that actively undermine
our ability to work with allies also.
That is another reason I was glad to
see the administration delay any tar-
iffs pursuant to this 232 we talked
about on automobiles and auto parts. A
lot of those 232 tariffs would have been
imposed on our allies. Not only do
autos and auto parts from our allies or
anywhere else in the world not threat-
en our national security, but it also in-
vites retaliation on U.S. exports and
poisons the well of good will we need
with our historic allies as we pursue a
resolution of our differences with
China.
Let me end where we started—about
balanced trade. All America needs is a
level playing field. We can compete. We
have the ability to innovate. We have
the ability to be flexible. We have a lot
of advantages in this country, but we
do need a level playing field. All we ask
for is fair and reciprocal treatment
from our trading partners. The sweet
spot for America is that balanced ap-
proach—again, opening up new mar-
kets for U.S. products while insisting
on trade enforcement so that our work-
ers can compete.
As we talked about today, right now,
we have a lot of balls in the air in rela-
tion to trade. This has caused some un-
certainty among our trading partners,
with American businesses, workers,
and farmers that rely on trade. I get
that.
Let’s prioritize passing USMCA with
Canada and Mexico. That will provide
some certainty. Let’s support the ad-
ministration in bringing home a strong
agreement with China. That will pro-
vide a lot of certainty. And let’s not
impose new section 232 tariffs. That
will also provide some certainty and
predictability.
With that predictability and cer-
tainty further leveling the playing
field, we can help American farmers,
American workers, American busi-
nesses, and our economy.

since President Trump’s reckless deci-

clear agreement with Iran, which by all
accounts Iran had been complying
with, the administration has been on a
collision course that could draw us into
a war with Iran. Although the Presi-
dent insists that is not what he wants,
he is known to change his mind on a
whim, and the statements and actions
of others in his administration, includ-
ing some who were vocal proponents of
the unnecessary and costly war in Iraq,
leave little doubt that they favor a pol-
icy of regime change.
We all deplore Iran’s support for ter-
rorism, its ballistic missile program,
its horrific violations of human rights,
and its constant outpouring of hateful

anti-American, anti-Israel rhetoric,
but a war with Iran would be far worse,
and no one can be certain how it would
end. As tensions increase, a misunder-
standing or provocative act by either
Iran or the United States could quickly
trigger retaliatory strikes that spiral
out of control, drawing us, our allies,
and our adversaries into protracted
hostilities. Rather than risk that po-
tentially disastrous result, the admin-
istration should be partnering with our
European and Middle Eastern allies on
a strategy of negotiations to reduce re-
gional tensions. In that regard, I ask
unanimous consent that a recent op-ed
in ‘‘The Guardian’’ by Peter
Westmacott, former British Ambas-
sador to the United States, be printed
in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the Guardian, May 21, 2019]
TO DEFUSE THIS CRISIS THE US MUST START
TALKING TO IRAN
(By Peter Westmacott)
As Washington raises the stakes, the risk
of a misunderstanding is high—and it could
lead to a new conflict in the Middle East.
Washington’s foreign policy hawks—and by
extension for the rest of us. Donald Trump
says he doesn’t want a war with Iran, but his
national security adviser, JJohn Bolton, has
despatched warships and bombers to the re-
gion while the US secretary of state Mike
Pompeo has been sharing worrying intel-
ligence about Iranian intentions with close
allies and congressional leaders.
What’s going on? It’s now a year since
Trump tore up the nuclear deal with Iran ne-
gotiated in 2015 by the Obama administra-
tion along with Britain, France, Germany,
Russia, China and the EU. Since then, egged
on by Israel and the Gulf states, he has an-
nounced new sanctions, despite Iran’s full
compliance with the terms of the deal, and
tried bullying the Europeans and others into
applying US sanctions in order to deny Ira-
nians the economic benefits they were prom-
ised.
After a year of waiting to see if the other
signatories would make the deal work with-
out US cooperation, the Iranians announced
earlier this month that they would no longer
fully comply with the uranium and heavy
water restrictions of the agreement—and
that, unless the Europeans could help with
oil and banking within 60 days, more drastic
measures would follow. Western govern-
ments sometimes forget that the Iranian
government is not a monolithic entity, and
that the officials they are used to dealing
with, such as president Hassan Rouhani and
foreign minister Javad Zarif, are under con-
stant pressure from hardliners who point to
the lack of any return on the investment
Iran made four years ago.
Since Trump pulled the plug, the Euro-
peans have been working on a scheme to
allow some forms of trade with Iran to con-
tinue independently of the US. Its effects
have been limited, leading the supreme lead-
er, Ali Khamenei, to convince himself—
wrongly—that the Europeans were only ever
playing good cop to Washington’s bad cop.
As US sanctions continue to damage the Ira-
nian economy, Trump says he is still inter-
ested in some kind of grand bargain. Tehran
should call me, the president says, perhaps
not realising that there would be huge polit-
ical consequences for anyone who did.
But outside the US, the impression has
grown that the hawks in the Trump adminis-
tration are more interested in regime change
than in policy change—and by military ac-
tion if necessary. There are shades here of
Iraq 2003, when the George W Bush adminis-
tration was desperate to prove that Saddam
Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. It
is nonsense to claim, as Pompeo did last
month, that ‘‘there is a connection between
the Islamic Republic of Iran and al-Qaida.
Period. Full stop’’. Al-Qaida’s roots are in
Sunni, Wahhabist Saudi Arabia, and it hates
Shia Iran almost as much as it hates the US
and its allies.
The Europeans have never disagreed about
the nature or extent of Iran’s destabilising
activity in the region. But they don’t buy
the regime change argument, knowing from
experience that outside pressure is more
likely to strengthen rather than weaken the
hardliners. They also still believe that the
best way to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear
weapons is to stick with the deal.
There is now a real risk of the world find-
ing itself with another Middle Eastern con-
flict on its hands, by accident or miscalcula-
tion. What can be done? As many of us have
been saying to Iranian officials for some
time, they should help others to stand up for
the nuclear deal by moderating Iran’s behav-
iour in the region: stop supplying sophisti-
cated weaponry to Hezbollah in Lebanon;
and stop supplying missiles to the Houthi
militia in Yemen that perpetuate the hor-
rific civil war. Iran could use its influence
over President Bashar al-Assad to press him
to avoid further bloodshed in Syria. And it
could end the imprisonment and abuse of
dual nationals and other Iranian citizens on
specious grounds.
Some suggest that current tensions may be
partly the result of misunderstandings be-
tween Tehran and Washington. That
wouldn’t be surprising, given the long his-
tory of distrust and the absence of diplo-
matic relations between the two countries
for 4o years. But it serves as a reminder that
some form of direct communication is essen-
tial: both sides should move quickly to acti-
vate private channels.
Back in 1987—when the UN security coun-
cil was trying to stop the Iran-Iraq war Sad-
dam had started (with western encourage-
ment) seven years earlier—the council
passed a resolution calling for an immediate
ceasefire and a withdrawal to international
borders. It didn’t manage to stop Saddam
launching another, ultimately unsuccessful
offensive. But tucked away in paragraph
eight was a request to the secretary general
‘‘to examine, in consultation with Iran and
Iraq and with other states in the region,
measures to enhance the security of the re-
gion’’.
That resolution is still valid. Why not look
again at the idea of all the regional powers,
under UN auspices, coming together with a
view to lowering tensions? A recent OpEd in
the New York Times by Abdulaziz Sager, a
Saudi Arabian academic, and Hussein
Moussavian, a former Iranian nuclear nego-
tiator, argues that the time for the region’s
two big rivals to sit down and try to bury the
hatchet might just might have come. So
much is at stake that it’s surely worth a try.
f
TRIBUTE TO JOHN PAUL STEVENS
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has
been nearly a decade since Justice
John Paul Stevens retired from the Su-
preme Court. His absence on the bench
is perhaps felt more now than ever.
Justice Stevens’ nomination was the
first of 18 Supreme Court nominees I
have considered in my years in the
Senate. As a young Senator, it was a
privilege to support his confirmation in
1975. It was a vote I have long been
proud of. Justice Stevens had a storied
tenure on the Supreme Court and ulti-
mately became the third longest serv-
ing Justice in our Nation’s history.
Justice Stevens’ commitment to the
law and conduct on the bench was be-
yond reproach. His legacy is one of in-
tegrity, dedication to public service,
and a recognition that the Constitu-
tion protects all Americans equally. He
was part of majorities that protected
LGBT rights, disability rights, and
limited the death penalty.
The Supreme Court has never been
perfect. Justice Stevens would be the
first to acknowledge as much, but I
cannot help but compare his many
years on the Court with today. Today,
the Supreme Court almost reflexively
sides with corporate interests over in-
dividuals’ interests, even when prece-
dent or so-called textualism and
originalism stand in the way. We have
also seen an unprecedented blockade of
a Supreme Court nominee, and we have
a President intent on nominating the
most ideological nominees to the bench
I have ever seen, nominees who have
been preapproved by opaque far-right
special interest groups. Many of these
nominees have long records of outright
hostility toward reproductive rights,
environmental protections, and voting
and civil rights. They even refuse to
accept that Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation, a foundational civil rights deci-
sion settled 65 years ago, is indeed set-
tled law. It is equally predictable and
deeply unfortunate that Americans in-
creasingly view the courts as a purely
political institution.
Our Constitution and laws are in-
tended to serve the people, protecting
the freedom of individuals from the
tyranny of government and helping to
organize our society for the good of all.
It is up to the judiciary to ensure our
laws have meaning. This is a duty Jus-
tice Stevens’ recognized and relished.
How I miss his jurisprudence, his
steady voice, and his leadership.
I ask unanimous consent that a May
11, 2019, feature by Robert Barnes from
The Washington Post entitled, ‘‘John
Paul Stevens looks back on nearly a
century of life and law, but worries
about the future,’’ be included in the

JOHN PAUL STEVENS LOOKS BACK ON NEARLY
A CENTURY OF LIFE AND LAW, BUT WORRIES
ABOUT THE FUTURE
(By Robert Barnes)
FORT LAUDERDALE, FL.—John Paul Ste-
vens spent more than a third of his near-cen-
tury on Earth at the Supreme Court, where
he often was on a different page from a ma-
jority of his fellow justices.
‘‘It happens so often that you have to get
used to losing,’’ Stevens, 99, said during an
interview this last week at his condominium
here, just steps from the Atlantic Ocean.
‘‘My batting average was probably pretty
low.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3043
May 22, 2019
But one particular loss lingers and, Ste-
vens says, brings grim reminders almost
weekly: the court’s 2008 decision in District
of Columbia v. Heller, which found the Sec-
ond Amendment protects a right to indi-
vidual gun ownership unrelated to possible
military service.
‘‘Unquestionably the most clearly incor-
rect decision that the Court announced dur-
ing my tenure on the bench,’’ Stevens writes
in his new memoir, ‘‘The Making of a Jus-
tice.’’
Heller and the Second Amendment, Ste-
vens said in the interview, produce ‘‘such
disastrous practical effects. I think there’s
no need for all the guns we have in the coun-
try and if I could get rid of one thing it
would be to get rid of that whole gun cli-
mate.’’
He continued: ‘‘Just the other day there
was another school shooting in Colorado, and
every time it happens, it seems to me we
don’t have to have this kind of thing in this
country, and we should do everything we can
to try to change it.’’
Stevens writes of his efforts to try to make
the 5-to-4 decision come out the other way.
His 531-page book, to be published Tuesday,
details the life and career of a World War II
Navy code-breaker from a solidly Republican
family, nominated to the federal bench by
one GOP president (Richard M. Nixon) and
elevated to the Supreme Court by another
(Gerald R. Ford) who retired in 2010 as the
court’s most outspoken liberal. Although,
Stevens believes the court changed more
than he did.
In the interview, he expressed generalized
distress at the state of the world and the na-
tion’s politics. ‘‘You wake up in the morning
and you wonder what’s happened,’’ he said.
Still, he retains a judge’s reticence even
years after leaving the bench: ‘‘But I
shouldn’t say more.’’
He does wonder why it is so challenging for
his former colleagues to recognize that par-
tisan gerrymandering is a constitutional vio-
lation, as they do with racial gerry-
mandering. ‘‘It’s the same issue,’’ he said.
‘‘Public officials, including state legislators,
have a duty to act impartially. The whole
point [of partisan gerrymandering] is to cre-
ate an unfair result.’’
And he expressed surprise about Chief Jus-
tice John G. Roberts Jr., whom he respects
and admires. ‘‘I must confess he’s more con-
servative than I realized,’’ Stevens said.
‘‘But that doesn’t go to his quality as a chief
justice.’’
During the interview, Stevens was pre-
paring for a reunion of his clerks—more than
90 of 125 were expected to attend. He must
steady himself with a walker, but he remains
active. Tennis has been replaced by ping-
pong, he said, but he still plays nine holes of
golf each week.
‘‘I don’t go in the ocean as much as I used
to, and that’s really my favorite activity
down here,’’ he said. ‘‘A strong guy’’ to help
him in and out of the surf is now ‘‘an abso-
lute necessity,’’ he said.
It is hard to imagine that at his 1975 con-
firmation hearing, soon after he became one
of the first to receive a heart bypass oper-
ation, the main obstacle was ‘‘did I have a
sufficient life expectancy to justify the im-
portant appointment,’’ he writes. He was ap-
proved unanimously. The memoir is a tale of
a privileged childhood in Chicago, the rav-
ages of the Great Depression and a family
scandal, service as a wartime cryptologist
and a charmed legal career as a Supreme
Court clerk, appeals court judge and the
third-longest-serving justice in the court’s
history.
Stevens was in the stands at Wrigley Field
in Chicago when Babe Ruth called his shot in
the 1932 World Series—‘‘my most important
claim to fame,’’ he writes—and in the audi-
ence at the Democratic National Convention
that summer when Franklin D. Roosevelt ex-
plained the New Deal on his way to becoming
president. His father, Ernest, who took Ste-
vens to the speech, was a Warren Harding
Republican, however.
Amelia Earhart told him he was out too
late for a school night when she attended the
grand opening of the Stevens Hotel in Chi-
cago, at the time the largest in the world.
Charles Lindbergh passed along a caged dove
someone had given him. On a trip to the
South, Stevens and his family attended
‘‘Gone With The Wind’’ the week it in opened
in Atlanta.
The invitations that come to a Supreme
Court justice provide other celebrity tidbits.
He was as smitten as others when he met
Princess Diana, and an encounter with the
composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein
provides a surprisingly bawdy anecdote from
the mannerly Stevens, who often prefaced
his questions on the bench with a courtly,
‘‘May I just ask . . . ?’’
It was during a dinner at the French Em-
bassy in Washington when Stevens and his
wife, Maryan, were seated with Bernstein,
who had just conducted the Orchestre Na-
tional de France at the Kennedy Center.
Maryan wondered about the emotions that
accompany performing a masterpiece.
‘‘It’s like [making love] in a cathedral,’’
Bernstein replied, according to Stevens in
the memoir. The justice dutifully used the f-
word to authenticate his reporting.
‘‘The Making of a Justice’’ is Stevens’s
third book since leaving the court; the oth-
ers chronicle the chief justices with whom he
served and how he would remake the Con-
stitution. He said he is unsure if there is a
lesson in it for readers. ‘‘I didn’t have a spe-
cific mission in mind, I just started to
write,’’ he said.
One lesson from childhood that informed
his career, though, involved his father. The
Depression hit after the Stevens Hotel
opened, and the place faltered. The hotel bor-
rowed money from an insurance company
controlled by Stevens’s grandfather, an act
that a Cook County prosecutor viewed as
embezzlement. Ernest Stevens was found
guilty, only to have his conviction over-
turned by the Illinois Supreme Court, which
found not a ‘‘scintilla’’ of evidence of crimi-
nal intent.
‘‘Firsthand knowledge of the criminal jus-
tice’s fallibility’’ made Stevens skeptical for
the rest of his career, he said. ‘‘The system
is not perfect—it’s pretty good, but it’s not
perfect’’
Stevens was part of majorities that handed
important victories to gays, limited the
death penalty and mostly held the line on
abortion rights.
On the latter, he said he is puzzled by
‘‘more and more state legislatures’’ passing
restrictive laws in hopes of getting the Su-
preme Court to revisit the court’s rulings.
‘‘I thought that was an issue that had been
resolved,’’ he said. ‘‘I have no idea what the
present court will do.’’
In the book, he detailed his efforts to de-
rail the Heller majority. He adopted Justice
Antonin Scalia’s originalist approach to
show, in his opinion, that historical texts
supported the view that the Second Amend-
ment was aimed at preventing federal disar-
mament of state militias, rather than forbid-
ding efforts at gun control.
He wrote that he circulated his dissent five
weeks before Scalia’s majority opinion, in
hopes of persuading Justice Anthony M. Ken-
nedy and—somewhat surprisingly—Justice
Clarence Thomas.
‘‘I think he’s an intellectually honest per-
son, and I just thought there was a chance he
might be persuaded’’ on the historical argu-
ments, Stevens said of Thomas. ‘‘I guess I
was kind of dreaming a little bit.’’
But Stevens said the effort did succeed in
getting Kennedy to insist Scalia include lim-
iting language that states and cities have
used to defend their gun-control measures.
In the book, Stevens refers to U.S. v.
Nixon, in which the court said the president
must turn over White House tapes to con-
gressional investigators, as ‘‘the high point
for judicial independence.’’
He wrote the court’s unanimous decision in
Clinton v. Jones, saying that a sitting presi-
dent does not have immunity from all civil
lawsuits for actions when he was not in of-
fice.
Both were unanimous and ‘‘easy deci-
sions,’’ Stevens said, but he declined to be
drawn into the current battle between con-
gressional investigators and President
Trump.
He is asked: Nothing to say about the
president? ‘‘Nothing that you don’t know al-
ready,’’ he said.
f
TRIBUTE TO BISHOP THOMAS C.
ELY
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I
pay tribute to a wonderful friend,
Bishop Thomas C. Ely, who is retiring
from his leadership position of the
Episcopal Diocese of Vermont.
Bishop Ely has been an outstanding
servant of the Vermont diocese since
his consecration as bishop in 2001. Dur-
ing his tenure in the Green Mountain
State, he has served as the leader of
the 45 Episcopal congregations in
Vermont and one more across Lake
Champlain in Essex, NY. He has visited
all parishes once a year and counseled
many clergy members. Bishop Ely’s de-
votion to human dignity and dignity
education influenced every church in
the diocese. He demonstrated this as
chairman of the board and as an educa-
tor of Rock Point School in Bur-
lington, where his wife Ann worked all
through his tenure as bishop. Bishop
Ely, as a promoter of social justice and
equality, also showed leadership in
many other ways. He has been active in
immigrants’ rights, marriage equality,
improving the lives of those living in
poverty and in Bishops Against Gun Vi-
olence. His work on human rights is il-
lustrated in his long commitment to
the human rights organization
Cristosal, which works in Central
America.
Recently, Bishop Ely completed the
successful Partnership Campaign for
Rock Point, raising over $2 million to
assure the future of the 130 acres owned
by the Church on Lake Champlain in
Burlington. The funds will improve the
trails and facilities in partnership with
the city of Burlington and the Lake
Champlain Land Trust, preserving 93
acres for public access.
I am proud to say that Bishop Ely
lives his faith, through worship, leader-
ship, and through action to improve
and enrich the lives of all Vermonters.
His journey of faith and action would
not have been possible without the love
and support of Ann Ely who, in addi-
tion to her work at Rock Point School,
has also been deeply involved in St.
Paul’s Cathedral in Burlington.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3044 May 22, 2019
The outpouring of gratitude and love
for Tom and Ann has been enormous,
in particular at the May 18, 2019, con-
vention, where Vermont Episcopalians
elected their next bishop. The applause
would not cease until Bishop Ely mo-
tioned for quiet, so that proceedings
could continue. Bishop Ely is loved by
his people and greatly appreciated by
many Vermonters for his principled
leadership. He made a difference, help-
ing us to live up to our ideals, and will
be fondly remembered, as he and Ann
enter a new phase of their lives.
Marcelle and I are delighted that Tom
and Ann will continue to be citizens of
Vermont, living in the beautiful town
of Newfane. We both value their friend-
ship.
In honor of Bishop Ely’s retirement,
I ask that the December 5, 2017, Epis-
copal New Service article ‘‘Vermont
Episcopal Bishop Thomas Ely an-
nounces plans to retire,’’ be entered
into the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the Episcopal News Service, Dec. 5,
2017]
VERMONT EPISCOPAL BISHOP THOMAS ELY
ANNOUNCES PLAN TO RETIRE
The Right Reverend Thomas C. Ely, tenth
bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont,
recently announced his intention to retire
and resign his ministry, no later than Sep-
tember 30, 2019. He has agreed to remain in
his position until a successor is chosen and is
in place.
Ely, 65, was consecrated as bishop of the
Vermont diocese in 2001, having previously
served as a priest in the Diocese of Con-
necticut for 20 years. In a message to the
people of the Diocese of Vermont, Ely said
that by the time of his retirement he will
have served in the priesthood for nearly 39
years.
‘‘There are other interests and ministries
to which I am feeling called to devote my
time and energy while my health and stam-
ina are still good,’’ Ely said, ‘‘including fam-
ily, community theatre, various justice min-
istries and a bit more golf.’’
During his episcopate, Ely has been a lead-
er both within the diocese and throughout
the wider Episcopal Church on such con-
troversial issues as marriage equality, the
ordination of LGBT clergy, increased gun
safety and racial justice. He is also a leading
voice on matters of environmental and eco-
nomic justice.
As part of his global outreach, Ely serves
on the board of Cristosal, a nongovernmental
agency based in El Salvador that works to
advance human rights in Central America.
Additionally, he is a co-founder of the
Vermont chapter of Kids4Peace, a grassroots
interfaith youth movement dedicated to end-
ing conflict and inspiring hope in Jerusalem
and divided societies around the world. More
locally, Ely is a leading advocate for the
Vermont Ecumenical Council and Vermont
Interfaith Action.
Ely has been instrumental in the steward-
ship and revitalization of Rock Point, a 130-
acre property in Burlington, owned by the
Vermont diocese, known for its natural
beauty and peaceful atmosphere. Each year,
nearly 10,000 people visit Rock Point, and
Ely is overseeing a $1.7 million partnership
campaign aimed at improving facilities,
strengthening leadership and expanding pub-
lic access.
Ely said that he and his wife, Ann, will
take up residence in their house in Newfane,
Vermont, upon his retirement. In the mean-
time, he says, ‘‘I plan to use these months
ahead to continue encouraging full and pas-
sionate engagement in our local mission ap-
proaches, and I plan to continue my efforts
related to a sustainable Rock Point and all
that means to our life as the Episcopal
Church in Vermont.’’
f
RECOGNIZING DARN TOUGH SOCKS
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Darn
Tough Vermont says that their factory
in Northfield, Vermont, is the ‘‘Sock
Capital of the World.’’ I’m loath to ob-
ject to that claim. Over the past 15
years, Darn Tough has steadily grown
from a small sock producer for other
companies into a world-renowned
brand of their own. They’ve created
good paying jobs to Vermont and have
a deep commitment to American man-
ufacturing. Darn Tough is a great ex-
ample of the many hearty small busi-
nesses that drive Vermont’s economy.
It is with pride that I recognize their
achievements.
Marc Cabot opened Darn Tough’s fac-
tory, Cabot Hosiery Mills, in 1978. He
started by producing private label
socks—other companies sell these
under their brand name—for large com-
panies like Brooks Brothers and Old
Navy. This was a steady business. But
things became difficult in the 1990s
when many of those customers began
to move their production overseas. By
the early 2000s, Cabot Hosiery Mills
was struggling.
Marc’s son, Ric, who had been in-
volved in the family business from a
young age, came up with an idea to
save the company. He decided to tran-
sition Cabot Hosiery Mills from a pri-
vate label producer to its own brand:
Darn Tough Vermont. Ric envisioned a
superior, outdoor-oriented sock that
was knit right in Vermont. Its quality
would speak for itself.
At first, Ric had to give Darn Tough
socks away to get noticed. He gave out
3,500 pairs of Darn Tough socks at the
Vermont City Marathon in 2004, and
soon after word, began to spread about
a mysteriously durable sock with a
lifetime warranty produced right in
Vermont. Darn Tough’s brand and sales
have been growing steadily ever since.
Over the past 15 years, the Cabots
have rebounded from the brink of
bankruptcy to a company nearing $50
million in sales annually. Ric, who is
now the CEO and president, is leading
Darn Tough in its latest expansion.
They’ve added over 50 new knitting
stations and are in the process of ex-
panding their workforce of over 250
Vermonters. Darn Tough doubled down
on American manufacturing when their
partners wouldn’t—now they’re seeing
their reward.
I am proud to recognize the contribu-
tions and achievements that Darn
Tough and the Cabot family has made
over their over 40 years in Vermont. I
ask consent to enter into the RECORD a
VTDigger article titled ‘‘Making it in
Vermont: Darn Tough doubles down on
Northfield facilities.’’ It describes the
hard work that goes into making each
Darn Tough sock and highlights Darn
Tough’s commitment to Vermont and
Vermont values.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From VTDigger, March 31, 2019]
MAKING IT IN VERMONT: DARN TOUGH
DOUBLES DOWN ON NORTHFIELD FACILITIES
Ask Kirk Smith how many colors of yarn
are used at Cabot Hosiery Mills, and he’ll
tell you: ‘‘Too many.’’
The family-owned factory that produces
Darn Tough socks will include up to 16 dif-
ferent threads in a single design. The oper-
ation spins out 22,000 pairs of socks every
single day.
From the outside, the Northfield produc-
tion facility isn’t much to look at—it’s big,
beige and unmarked. But inside, thousands
of spools of multicolored yarn hang from the
ceiling, while computerized machines knit
the threads into socks.
‘‘If you had seen me when they took me on
my tour when I was being interviewed here,
I was like a kid in a candy shop,’’ said
Smith, the plant’s manager of manufac-
turing operations. ‘‘I didn’t want to leave
the line. I just wanted to keep seeing what
was going on.’’
Lined up in rows with their electronic dis-
plays blinking, the mill’s 184 knitting sta-
tions resemble slot machines at a casino.
But they have a more predictable output:
roughly every five minutes, each one dis-
penses a fresh new sock.
Darn Tough is in the midst of an ambitious
five-year expansion plan. In order to increase
production, they’re adding more machines,
bringing their total to 236—for now. Ric
Cabot, the company’s president and CEO,
said those machines will increase the mill’s
production by 1.5 million pairs of socks per
year.
‘‘Accommodating the new equipment re-
quired moving their packaging and distribu-
tion areas to another building about a mile
down the road. That means the company’s
annual ‘‘sock sale’’—two weekends in No-
vember when locals walk the warehouse
looking for deals on factory seconds—will
take place at the company’s satellite loca-
tion this year.
There are two sock seasons each year, and
the factory works about six months ahead of
schedule. Right now, they’re mainly pro-
ducing fall socks.
Each piece is knit, washed, dried, boarded,
folded, inspected and packaged in Northfield,
before being shipped off to the company’s
distribution center in Cleveland, Ohio.
‘‘The Cabots have always been very dedi-
cated to their Northfield roots,’’ Smith said.
‘‘Could there be better places in the state?
Maybe, but this is where they started. This
is where they have a connection and this is
where we’ll be.’’
f
BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to
submit to the Senate the budget
scorekeeping report for May 2019. The
report compares current-law levels of
spending and revenues with the
amounts the Senate agreed to in the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18.
This information is necessary for the
Senate Budget Committee to deter-
mine whether budgetary points of
order lie against pending legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3045
May 22, 2019
The Republican staff of the Budget
Committee and the Congressional
Budget Office, CBO, prepared this re-
port pursuant to section 308(b) of the
Congressional Budget Act, CBA.
This is my fourth scorekeeping re-
port this year. My last filing can be
found in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for
April 10, 2019. The information included
in this report is current through May
20, 2019.
Since my last filing, Congress has
cleared only one measure, S. 1436, a bill
to make technical corrections to the
computation of average pay under Pub-
lic Law 110–279, with significant budg-
etary effects. This bill made changes to
the calculation of retirement benefits
for certain employees who staff the
dining services for the U.S. Senate.
Those services were privatized in 2008.
Budget Committee Republican staff
prepared tables A–C.
Table A gives the amount by which
each Senate authorizing committee ex-
ceeds or is below its allocation for
budget authority and outlays under the
fiscal year 2019 enforceable levels filing
required by BBA18. This information is
used for enforcing committee alloca-
tions pursuant to section 302 of the
CBA. Over the current 10-year enforce-
able window, authorizing committees
have increased outlays by a combined
$3.4 billion. For this reporting period, 9
of the 16 authorizing committees are
not in compliance with their alloca-
tions. As a result of passage of S. 1436,
the Senate Committee on Rules and
Administration is now in violation of
its allocation for both budget author-
ity and outlays over the fiscal year
2019–2028 period.
Table B provides the amount by
which the Senate Committee on Appro-
priations is below or exceeds the statu-
tory spending limits. This information
is used to determine points of order re-
lated to the spending caps found in sec-
tions 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2019, displayed in
this table, show that the Appropria-
tions Committee is compliant with
spending limits for the current fiscal
year. Those limits for regular discre-
tionary spending are $647 billion for ac-
counts in the defense category and $597
billion for accounts in the nondefense
category of spending.
The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution
contained points of order limiting the
use of changes in mandatory programs
in appropriations bills, CHIMPs. Table
C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15
billion for fiscal year 2019, shows the
Appropriations Committee has enacted
$15 billion worth of full-year CHIMPs
for this fiscal year.
In addition to the tables provided by
Budget Committee Republican staff, I
am submitting CBO tables, which I will
use to enforce budget totals approved
by Congress.
For fiscal year 2019, CBO estimates
that current-law levels are $2.9 billion
above and $3.3 billion below enforceable
levels for budget authority and out-
lays, respectively. Revenues are $426
million below the level assumed in the
budget resolution. Further, Social Se-
curity revenues are at the levels as-
sumed for fiscal year 2019, while Social
Security outlays are $4 million above
assumed levels for the budget year.
CBO’s report also provides informa-
tion needed to enforce the Senate pay-
as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO
scorecard shows deficit increases in fis-
cal year 2019 of $1,957 million, $427 mil-
lion revenue loss, $1,530 million outlay
increase; over the fiscal year 2018–2023
period of $3,373 million, $894 million
revenue loss, $2,479 million outlay in-
crease; and over the fiscal year 2018–
2028 period of $443 million, $634 million
revenue loss, $191 million outlay de-
crease.
This submission also includes a table
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on May 7, 2018. Since
my last report, no new budgetary
points of order were raised.
All years in the accompanying tables
are fiscal years.
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables be printed in the
RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

U.S. CONGRESS,
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE,
Washington, DC, May 22, 2019.
Hon. MIKE ENZI,
Chairman, Committee on the Budget,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report
shows the effects of Congressional action on
the fiscal year 2019 budget and is current
through May 20, 2019. This report is sub-
mitted under section 308(b) and in aid of sec-
tion 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as
amended.
The estimates of budget authority, out-
lays, and revenues are consistent with the
allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary
levels printed in the Congressional Record on
May 7, 2018, pursuant to section 30103 of the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law
115–123).
Since our last letter dated April 10, 2019,
the Congress has not cleared any legislation
for the President’s signature that affects
budget authority, outlays, or revenues in fis-
cal year 2019.
Sincerely,
MARK P. HADLEY

n.a. = not applicable; P.L. = Public Law.
a. Includes the budgetary effects of legislation enacted by Congress during the 115th Congress.
b. Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) or the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $771 million in budget authority, and $767 million in estimated outlays.
c. For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current level
does not include those items.
d. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116–5), as amended, extended several immigration programs through February 15, 2019, that would otherwise have expired at the end of fiscal year 2018. The estimated budgetary ef-
fects of those previously enacted extensions are charged to the Committee on Appropriations, and are included in the budgetary effects of P.L. 116–6 shown in the ‘‘Appropriation Legislation’’ portion of this report. In addition, division H of
P.L. 116–6 further extended those same programs through the end of fiscal year 2019. Consistent with the language in title III of division H of P.L. 116–6, and at the direction of the Senate Committee on the Budget, the budgetary ef-
fects of extending those immigration programs for the remainder of the fiscal year are charged to the relevant authorizing committees, and are shown in the ‘‘Authorizing Legislation’’ portion of this report.
e. Section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 requires the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first published in
the Congressional Record on May 7, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also allows the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget to revise the budgetary aggregates:

SRI LANKA
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, this week
marks the 10th anniversary of the end
of Sri Lanka’s decades-long civil war.
On May 19, 2009, Sri Lanka’s 26-year
conflict between the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, LTTE, and the govern-
ment of Sri Lanka came to a close with
the LTTE’s military defeat and sur-
render. This anniversary comes on the
heels of the horrible Easter Sunday
terrorist attacks on churches across
Sri Lanka for which we are still seek-
ing answers and accountability from
ISIS and its affiliates on the island.
While the end of the war was a
counterterrorism victory, we have
since learned the ugly cost of this ef-
fort. According to International Crisis
Group, in the final months of Sri
Lanka’s civil war, Sri Lankan Govern-
ment ‘‘attacks on its own self-declared
‘no-fire zones’ killed tens of thousands
of [Tamil] civilians . . . claims range
from 7,000 to 147,000 dead.’’ For several
years, I have been calling for an inter-
national, independent mechanism to
investigate allegations of war crimes
and crimes against humanity com-
mitted during the Sri Lankan conflict.
I also remain concerned about recent
violations of human rights and reli-
gious freedom in that country.
Since the end of the war, there has
yet to be real progress made on rec-
onciliation and accountability for
Tamils through domestic processes, as
recommended by the UN High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights 2015 Inves-
tigation on Sri Lanka, OISL. Human
rights violations against Tamil, Chris-

failed to bring to justice the perpetra-
tors of attacks against journalists, re-
ligious, and ethnic minorities and op-
position politicians.
Sri Lanka has a long way to go on its
path to reconciliation. In addition to
pursuing meaningful justice and ac-
countability, the Sri Lankan Govern-
ment must implement comprehensive
security sector reform, fully
operationalize the Office of Missing
Persons to provide families with an-
swers on what happened to their loved
ones, repeal the controversial Preven-
tion of Terrorism Act, PTA, release po-
litical prisoners as called for by our
own State Department and required by
fiscal year 2019 Appropriations bill and
address the root causes of the civil war
and the government’s responsibility to
protect citizens of all communities.
Concerns over intercommunal strife
are exacerbated by the horrific April 21
Easter attacks on churches and hotels
across the island that killed over 200
civilians. We are learning that ISIS-af-
filiated entities were behind the at-
tacks. As Sri Lanka deals with the
very new threat of Islamic extremism,
it is critical that its government not
repeat its pattern of suppressing
media, civil society, and religious free-
dom under the veil of counterter-
rorism. The government’s abuse of
emergency powers, recent ban on Mus-
lim face-covers, coupled with retalia-
tory attacks against mosques and Mus-
lim businesses with little response
from Sri Lanka law enforcement is
problematic and only serves to height-
en tensions between religious and eth-
nic communities. I urge the Sri
Lankan security forces to exercise re-
straint in their response to the Easter
attacks.
While horrific on their own, the
Easter attacks were a stark reminder
that, as we come upon the 10th anni-
versary of the end of Sri Lanka’s civil
war, intercommunal conflict remains a
reality on the island. The Sri Lankan
Government’s response to the Easter
attacks echoes of the country’s history
of conflict and oppression under cover
of counterterrorism. As we remember
and commemorate the tens of thou-
sands of lives lost leading up to May
2009, I urge Sri Lanka, the United
States and the international commu-
nity to continue to pursue justice, ac-
countability, and reconciliation for a
war-torn nation.

REMEMBERING ELLEN TAUSCHER
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
wish to speak about the wonderful spir-
it and dedication of Ellen Tauscher,
who was taken from us far too early on
April 29, 2019. She was a one of a kind
of person and very special to me.
Ellen is survived by her daughter
Katherine, who is an amazing young
woman. I have seen her through some
of the most difficult days and she has
an equanimity and an ability second to
none. Ellen’s sisters Sally and Kathy
and brother Jack provided very strong
family support to her, especially at the
end. She is truly loved.
Ellen touched so many lives, and
anybody who has worked with her, had
dinner with her, drank a little Cali-
fornia wine with her knows the special
person she is.
Ellen was one of the first women and
the youngest woman ever at the age of
25 to become a member of the New
York Stock Exchange in 1977.
I was president of the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors at that time, and
I can tell you, being a woman on the
Stock Exchange at that time was a
very big deal.
Ellen was to go on to work in finance
for 14 years as a successful investment
banker and bond trader.
A few years after she moved west,
Ellen gave birth to her pride and joy,
the wonderful Katherine Tauscher. As
a new mother herself, Ellen struggled
to find good childcare, and she used
that experience to create the ChildCare
Registry, a service to help parents
check backgrounds of childcare cen-
ters.
You see, that was how she was. When
she saw a problem, she worked out a
solution. When Ellen Tauscher put her
mind to something, there was no stop-
ping her. Achievement was a given.
Ellen ran for a seat in Congress in
1996. The newly created district was
conservative, and few people thought it
would go to a Democrat, but Ellen ap-
pealed to moderates on both sides of
the aisle, and success, I always
thought, was a given. She went on to
win that seat and hold it for 12 years.
As a Member of Congress, Ellen made
a name for herself as a centrist, some-
one who could work both sides of the
aisle. Her colleagues, many of whom
attended the memorial service earlier
this week at the National Cathedral,
knew she would always do what was
best for her district and for the coun-
try.
Ellen sat on the House Armed Serv-
ices Committee and became chair of
the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.
Not necessarily what you would expect
from an elementary education major
from New Jersey, but Ellen was a real
force.
She developed an expertise and sub-
stantial knowledge in arms control,
nonproliferation, and nuclear weapons.
It was a good fit since her district was
home to Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.
That expertise and the ability to be
effective in a critically important post
was a big reason why then-Secretary of
State Clinton selected her and Presi-
dent Obama nominated her to be Un-
dersecretary of State for Arms Control
and International Security.
One of Ellen’s biggest accomplish-
ments in that role was shepherding the
negotiations over the New START
Treaty and helping with its ratifica-
tion through the Senate in 2010.
As a matter of fact, it was at her sug-
gestion that former Senator Jon Kyl
and I went to Geneva under the aus-
pices of the Senate National Security
Working Group to observe the negotia-
tions and meet with the Russian and
U.S. delegations. Ellen was so proud of
the treaty, and so are we.
She proved just how strong she was
during this most difficult period. She
did much of her work on the treaty
while suffering from esophageal cancer,
but she never let it slow her down.
When she retired from the Federal Gov-
ernment, a new world would open.
She was appointed by Governor Jerry
Brown to the University Of California
Board Of Regents, she chaired Califor-
nia’s Military Advisory Council, and
she served as vice chair of the Atlantic
Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strat-
egy and Security.
Just last year, she showed she was
still a player in California politics,
working with Katie Merrill to create a
Political Action Committee called
Fight Back, and that was just what
Ellen did.
Ellen was brilliant. She was warm
and loyal to her country, her family,
and her friends, and she had a wonder-
ful sense of humor. I saw this con-
stantly over a glass of wine and dinner
in Washington. She was always ready
with something that made friends
smile and even laugh.
She was, for me, a best friend, and
that will never change. Thank you.

TRIBUTE TO LAWRENCE E.
HENNING
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor an American hero who
served bravely in the European Cam-
paign of the Second World War.
Lawrence E. Henning of Great Falls,
MT, served in the Third Army under
the command of General George S. Pat-
ton. He marched with thousands of Al-
lied troops across the Continent,
through France, Luxembourg, Belgium,
and finally into Germany, deploying
his expertise of the tank destroyer in
the final, decisive year of the war.
Lawrence’s courage and ingenuity
were critical to the effort. His re-
sourcefulness allowed the battalion to
maintain a maximum number of tank
destroyers on the front line. His skills
and bravery on the battlefield earned
him commendations decades ago; it is
my honor to finally deliver them
today.
I am proud to present you, Lawrence,
with the Bronze Star Medal for your
Meritorious Service in connection with
military operations against an enemy
of the United States in France, Luxem-
bourg, Belgium, and Germany during
the period 15 September 1944 to 30
March 1945.
I am also presenting you with: the
American Defense Service Medal, the
European-African-Middle Eastern Cam-
paign Medal with 3 Bronze Service
Stars; the World War II Victory Medal;
and the Honorable Service Lapel But-
ton—World War II.
These medals are a small token of
our nation’s appreciation for your serv-
ice and your sacrifice.

NATIONAL SEERSUCKER DAY
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today I
rise in recognition of seersucker manu-
facturers and enthusiasts across the
United States. I wish everyone a Happy
National Seersucker Day. This unique-
ly American fashion has a storied his-
tory dating back to 1909. Louisiana is
proud to have played an important part
in introducing the country to seer-
sucker apparel. The first seersucker
suit was designed by Joseph Haspel at
his Broad Street facility in New Orle-
ans, LA.
This lightweight cotton fabric,
known for its signature pucker, has
been worn and enjoyed by Americans
across the country during the hot sum-
mer months. Mr. Haspel said it best,
‘‘Hot is hot, no matter what you do for
a living.’’ In the 1990s, Seersucker Day
was established by Members of this
Chamber to honor this unique Amer-
ican fashion. I proudly resumed this
tradition in 2014 in the U.S. House of
Representatives by designating
Wednesday, June 11, as National Seer-
sucker Day. I have continued this tra-
dition in the U.S. Senate and wish to
designate Thursday, June 13, as the
sixth annual National Seersucker Day.
I encourage everyone to wear seer-
sucker on this day to commemorate
this iconic American clothing.

TRIBUTE TO UTAH’S SERVICE
ACADEMY APPOINTEES
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is that
time of year where I am privileged to
recognize exceptional young men and
women from the great State of Utah
who have answered the call to serve by
applying to the U.S. Air Force Acad-
emy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Acad-
emy, the U.S. Military Academy, and
the U.S. Naval Academy. It is one of
my greatest honors to recognize these
fine Utahns in the U.S. Senate.
Under title 10 of the U.S. Code, each
year, Members of Congress are author-
ized to nominate a number of young
men and women from their district or
State to attend the country’s service
academies. Each of these students is of
sound mind and body. This will serve
them well in Colorado Springs, Kings
Point, West Point, and Annapolis, but
to succeed, they will need more than
this.
The journey on which these young
men and women will soon embark re-
quires more than mental and physical
aptitude. It also demands strong moral
character: leadership, courage, hon-
esty, prudence, and self-discipline. It
calls for a commitment to service and
a love of country. Ultimately, it pro-
vides a chance for some of Utah’s finest
to stand up for our country.
Today, I would like to congratulate
each of these impressive students, all
of whom embody, in their own unique
way, the standards of excellence upon
which America’s service academies are
built.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT
GENERAL SAMUEL A. GREAVES
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise
today to pay tribute to Lt. Gen. Sam-
uel A. Greaves, Director of the Missile
Defense Agency, on the advent of his
retirement from the U.S. Air Force
after 37 years of military service to
this great country.
General Greaves’ long and storied ca-
reer began when he was commissioned
in 1982 through the Air Force Reserve
Officer Training Corps Program after
he graduated from Cornell University.
Throughout his service, he has held a
variety of assignments in operational,
acquisition, and staff units, including
assignments at Headquarters Air Com-
bat Command; the National Reconnais-
sance Office; and on the Air Staff. He
commanded the 45th Launch Group at
Patrick AFB, Florida, the Launch and
Range Systems Wing, the Military Sat-
ellite Communications Systems Wing,
also served as vice commander, Space
and Missile Systems Center at Los An-
geles AFB. He later served as the direc-
tor, strategic plans, programs and
analyses, Headquarters Air Force
Space Command, Peterson AFB, Colo-
rado, and then was assigned as the dep-
uty director, Missile Defense Agency,
Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Prior to
his current assignment, he was the
commander, Space and Missile Sys-
tems Center, Air Force Space Com-
mand, Los Angeles Air Force Base,
California.
His operational experience is excep-
tional and includes work on the space
shuttle, Titan, Atlas and Delta space-
launch systems. He currently wears the
Command Space Badge, a joint Air
Force and Army award for training, ex-
perience, and assignments in space
warning, satellite command and con-
trol, missile operations, space surveil-
lance, and/or space lift.
During his tour, the Agency and the
Department of Defense made signifi-
cant progress in addressing current and
emerging ballistic missile threats by
fielding, upgrading, and improving mis-
sile defenses to provide U.S. military
commanders a highly effective ballistic
missile defense capability to defend the
United States and its deployed troops,
U.S. allies, and friends around the
world. He also laid the groundwork for
the Agency’s pursuit of technologies
and systems to track and defeat
hypersonic glide vehicle threats. Gen-
eral Greaves implemented a clear
strategy focusing on maintaining the
reliability of the Ballistic Missile De-
fense System, BMDS, to build
warfighter confidence, increasing capa-
bility and capacity of fielded missile
defense systems, and making measured
investments to address the advanced
threat.
While serving as the director, Missile
Defense Agency, General Greaves dem-
onstrated superior leadership, extraor-
dinary dedication, and exceptional pro-
fessionalism as the key interface be-
tween MDA and the Office of the Sec-
retary of Defense, Joint Staff, Combat-
ant Commands, Services and Military
Departments, the Department of State,
and international partners. He also

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3051
May 22, 2019
worked very closely with the adminis-
tration and Congress to support signifi-
cant improvements to the Nation’s
missile defense programs and plans in
2017, known as the missile defeat and
defense enhancements, that resulted in
Congress increasing the Missile De-
fense Agency’s budget request for fiscal
year 2018 from $7.8 billion to over $11.5
billion, which represents both the larg-
est single year increase and total budg-
et in MDA’s history.
General Greaves placed a high pri-
ority on increasing the ground-based
midcourse defense’s, GMD, fleet reli-
ability and confidence by upgrading
fielded GBIs, implementing improve-
ments in new production GBIs, and in-
corporating reliability, producibility
and sustainability improvements in fu-
ture GBI designs. General Greaves
oversaw GMD ground system mod-
ernization, to include delivery of
Ground System 7A, which removed ob-
solete equipment from the kill chain,
eliminated cyber defense
vulnerabilities, and improved redun-
dancy for the warfighter. He also
pressed forward with key reliability
improvements, including the develop-
ment of the redesigned kill vehicle,
RKV, and upgrading of the GMD Com-
munications Network, and launch sup-
port equipment.
General Greaves also successfully
completed the expansion of the Na-
tion’s deployed GBI fleet to 44 intercep-
tors in 2017, known as 44 by 17, which
resulted in a nearly 50 percent increase
in the number of deployed interceptors
available for use by the warfighter.
Moreover, in response to the growing
North Korean ICBM threat, in Decem-
ber 2017, General Greaves began exe-
cuting Department and congressional
guidance in the missile defeat and de-
fense enhancements plan to further ex-
pand the GBI fleet to a total of 64 de-
ployed GBIs by 2023 through the rapid
and efficient construction of a new,
fourth missile field at Fort Greely, AK,
which will add 20 additional oper-
ational silos to the GMD system.
If this were not enough, he oversaw
multiple successful flight tests. This
includes flight test ground-based mid-
course test 11, FTG–11, a GBI salvo test
against a complex, threat representa-
tive ICBM-class target. This intercept
flight test was so successful that the
director for the Department Oper-
ational Test and Evaluation, DOT&E,
Agency directed DOT&E staff to refer
to FTG–11 as the first operational
flight test of the ground-based mid-
course defense system. FTM–45, also
conducted under his direction, dem-
onstrated an Aegis BMD organic en-
gagement using a SM–3 Blk IIA against
a MRBM, a key milestone for the SM–
3 Block IIA return to flight. In addi-
tion, he directed the flight test inte-
grated 3, FTI–03, an operational live
fire test demonstrating the engage-on-
remote capability of the Aegis Weapon
System to track and intercept an
IRBM target with an Aegis Ashore-
launched SM–3 Block IIA interceptor.
This test demonstrated the effective-
ness of the European phased adaptive
approach phase 3 architecture and sup-
ports a critical acquisition milestone
for the SM–3 Block IIA missile pro-
gram.
General Greaves also laid the founda-
tion for the Long Range Discrimina-
tion Radar, Homeland Defense Radar-
Hawaii, Pacific Radar, and other dis-
crimination improvements to improve
homeland defense against emerging
threats. He further advanced the devel-
opment of two-stage booster capability
to provide additional homeland defense
battle-space capability by enabling
shorter engagement times without the
expense of a separate development pro-
gram. He also continued improvements
in the command and control, battle
management and communication infra-
structure, which provides persistent
acquisition, tracking, cueing, discrimi-
nation, and fire-control quality data to
Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD),
GMD, Terminal High Altitude Area De-
fense, THAAD, Patriot, and coalition
partners to support homeland and re-
gional missile defense.
General Greaves was further respon-
sible for major BMDS capability en-
hancements and asset deployments
around the globe. He guided program
plans to strengthen regional defenses
by continuing deliveries of Standard
Missile–3, SM–3, Block IBs, for use on
Aegis BMD ships and at Aegis Ashore-
Romania, and THAAD interceptors.
After fielding the THAAD Battery to
South Korea, in late 2017, the com-
mander of United States Forces Korea
requested tighter coupling between
THAAD and Patriot units in theater.
General Greaves worked with Army
PEO Missiles and Space on proposed so-
lutions to address the request and im-
prove regional ballistic missile defense.
He also pushed for the development of
a future THAAD system, including de-
velopment of a remote launcher capa-
bility, integration of Patriot MSE in-
terceptor and launcher into the
THAAD Weapon System, and improved
interoperability by enabling Patriot
Launch-on-Remote (THAAD).
He also continued advancement of
the Aegis BMD system in collaboration
with the Navy to counter growing and
more complex threats, including im-
provements in system and missile reli-
ability as well as increases in Aegis
BMD engagement capacity and
lethality, including work on the Aegis
Weapon System, Aegis Ashore-Poland,
the SM–3 IIA program, and Sea Based
Terminal defense. General Greaves
kept the Agency on track to deliver
the initial SM–3 Block IIA missiles de-
veloped in cooperation with Japan to
support European phased adaptive ap-
proach, EPAA, phase 3. He oversaw the
construction of the Aegis Ashore sys-
tem in Poland in support of EPAA
Phase 3 to improve European NATO de-
fenses against medium- and inter-
mediate-range ballistic missiles, which
is expected to be delivered in 2020.
General Greaves has been a tireless
advocate for the development and de-
ployment of a critically needed space
sensor layer for hypersonic and missile
defense, the need for which can be best
summed by the general himself when
he said: ‘‘If you can’t see it, you can’t
shoot it.’’ As a result of his efforts, the
Congress continually funded the MDA
to develop such a capability. In 2019,
the general partnered with DARPA and
the Air Force on the Hypersonic and
Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor Pro-
gram, which is now working with in-
dustry to reduce the key risks for this
space sensor layer.
He also successfully completed the
development and deployment of a net-
work of sensor payloads hosted on com-
mercial satellites, called Space-based
Kill Assessment, or SKA. This program
will collect data on missile intercepts,
and inform the post-intercept assess-
ment by the warfighter. This capa-
bility will provide the warfighter the
option to adjust their shot doctrine to
more efficiently manage interceptor
inventory, thereby dramatically in-
creasing the number of threats the sys-
tem can engage for the defense of the
homeland. In fact, when warfighters
took part in simulations involving
SKA they were so highly impressed by
this new capability they requested it
be made operational sooner than MDA
had planned. The SKA program has
been so impressive that the Depart-
ment recently recognized MDA, under
General Greaves leadership, for its ac-
quisition success by presenting it with
the Packard Award for Acquisition Ex-
cellence for the development of SKA.
General Greaves demonstrated his
commitment to expand work with U.S.
international partners, to include con-
ducting joint analyses to support part-
ner missile defense acquisition deci-
sions, cooperative research and devel-
opment projects, deploying BMD as-
sets, foreign military sales, FMS, and
coproduction efforts. Under General
Greave’s leadership, the Agency exe-
cuted an historic FMS case with the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for seven
THAAD batteries and accompanying
launchers, radars, and interceptors. In
addition, he continued work on the co-
development with Japan of the SM–3
Block IIA missile that will be deployed
to the operational Aegis Ashore missile
defense sites in Romania and Poland.
His exceptional leadership style in-
fluenced an organization of over 10,000
personnel across 13 time zones. These
distinctive accomplishments of Gen-
eral Greaves are monumental. As he
and his wife Patricia prepare for retire-
ment, I want to thank them for their
service to the United States of Amer-
ica—General Greaves and Patricia—
Bravo Zulu.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH
GUILLOTTE AND RICHARD
‘‘RICKY’’ MAZUR
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am
proud to recognize Elizabeth Guillotte
VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:34 May 23, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22MY6.018 S22MYPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3052 May 22, 2019
of Hill, NH, and Richard ‘‘Ricky’’
Mazur of Franklin, NH, as the May 2019
Granite Staters of the Month for their
dedication to helping their classmates
whose financial and/or family cir-
cumstances render them unable to af-
ford basic necessities like clothing and
toiletries.
When the Franklin High School
FIRST robotics team sat down to dis-
cuss how they could give back to their
community, Elizabeth and Richard had
an idea: They could revamp the make-
shift thrift shop at their school. Now,
students at Franklin High School who
are in need of anything from clothing,
to toothbrushes, to cereal, can get all
these items anonymously and for free
at the new and improved ‘‘Karma
Korner.’’
Elizabeth and Richard were inspired
to act after they noticed that some of
their classmates were walking the
halls in the same clothing that they
wore the day before and learned that
some classmates were eating their only
meal of the day in the school cafeteria.
With the support of their FIRST Ro-
botics teammates, the two students
moved an already existing makeshift
thrift shop to a wheelchair-accessible
room with better lighting and brightly
colored walls. They added food to the
inventory of items available for stu-
dents and started a program that al-
lows students to bring home a back-
pack stuffed with pantry items so that
they do not go hungry over the week-
end.
Ensuring anonymity and, as a result,
reducing stigma was important to Eliz-
abeth and Richard. If a student wants
to check out an item, all they need to
do is record what they are taking on a
clipboard, so that the students working
the pantry know what needs to be re-
plenished.
Many businesses in the surrounding
communities have also lent their sup-
port in the form of gift cards or do-
nated items. By collaborating with
local businesses and charities, Karma
Korner recently received washers and
dryers for student use, which were
bought and installed at no expense to
the school.
In establishing Karma Korner, Eliza-
beth and Richard have recognized and
elevated the dignity of their friends,
peers, and classmates, and they have
reminded us of our shared humanity
and shared promise. I join the rest of
the Franklin High School community
in thanking Richard and Elizabeth for
their efforts to help make their school
a more supportive and welcoming place
and congratulate them for being hon-
ored as May 2019’s Granite Staters of
the Month.∑

TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM MEDD
∑ Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor the efforts of Dr. William
Medd and his work with Western Maine
Health and Stephen’s Memorial Hos-
pital. His dedicated work with
MaineHealth, the largest health sys-
tem in Maine, has improved the lives
and health of many residents of west-
ern Maine.
Although Bill is originally from Long
Island, he has proudly called Maine
home for almost five decades. He stud-
ied and specialized in Internal Medi-
cine at Wesleyan University and then
at the University of Rochester School
of Medicine. Following his medical
residencies and 2 years of service in the
Air Force, Bill and his family relocated
to western Maine in the early 1970’s.
Throughout his career, Bill has dedi-
cated himself to improving the quality
of healthcare in Maine, specifically in
the rural area he has worked and lived.
His efforts to achieve this goal have
taken many forms, from serving as a
trustee at Western Maine Health Care
Corporation and MaineHealth to his 45
years as an internist in the Oxford
Hills region. Perhaps one of the most
symbolic aspects of Bill’s hard work is
the growth of the local hospital in Nor-
way, ME. At first a small facility when
Bill arrived, it is now a fully equipped,
modern hospital known as Stephen’s
Memorial and provides quality
healthcare to the rural region.
In early 2016, an expansion of West-
ern Maine Health, was named the Wil-
liam L. Medd, MD, Health Center. This
new facility integrated new models for
delivering primary care and relocated
other Western Maine Health units. For
the last 3 years, Bill has had the
unique opportunity to work out of the
facility that bears his name.
On March 30 of this year, Bill was
presented the Legacy Award at the Ox-
ford Hills Chamber of Commerce an-
nual dinner. Not only does this award
embody Bill’s commitment to
healthcare in Maine, but speaks to
other contributions he has made to his
community, from fundraising for local
scholarships to supporting youth pro-
grams in the region. His work in these
fields outside the medical profession
demonstrate Bill’s commitment to
more broadly improve his community.
I would like to thank Dr. Medd for
his decade’s long work in the State of
Maine. Thanks to his determination
and drive to make a difference, the fu-
ture of healthcare in western Maine is
bright. Dr. Medd’s passion for his pa-
tients, community, and State sets an
example for the medical professionals
who will follow him.
Congratulations, Dr. Medd, on a suc-
cessful career and happy retirement. I
look forward to seeing your continued
contributions to your community.∑

200TH ANNIVERSARY OF
PITTSFIELD, MAINE
∑ Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize the town of Pitts-
field, ME, which is celebrating its 200th
anniversary this year. Throughout its
long history, Pittsfield has continually
displayed a rich heritage of hard work,
entrepreneurship, innovation, commu-
nity, and family spirit. Situated along
the Sebasticook River in Somerset
County, Pittsfield is home to roughly
4,200 residents who help make it a
thriving Maine town.
Incorporated as Warsaw in 1819, the
town became Pittsfield in 1824, named
after one its prominent citizens, Wil-
liam Pitts. Early on, most of the
town’s occupants were farmers, grow-
ing so much corn and wheat that they
used the grains to pay their taxes. Like
many Maine towns, Pittsfield began to
develop a strong mill industry that
flourished along the Sebasticook River.
This assortment of textile, saw, and
grist mills created hundreds of new
jobs and Pittsfield saw its population
nearly double in just 40 years. Closures
and relocation of many of the town’s
mills lead to some decline, but the citi-
zens of Pittsfield helped reinvent the
town, and today, Pittsfield is as vi-
brant as ever.
Maine Central Institute, an inde-
pendent high school, opened in 1866 and
continues to serve many of the town’s
residents and foreign students from
such countries as South Korea, Spain,
Guatemala, and many more. The
school’s Manson Essay contest con-
tinues to bring members of the commu-
nity together every year to hear pres-
entations by students on their univer-
sity level research papers. Along with
its high-level academics, MCI’s impres-
sive athletic program has produced a
number of professional athletes, many
of whom have gone on to play profes-
sional basketball.
A hallmark of Pittsfield’s economy,
Cianbro was founded by Carl
Cianchette in 1946. Cianchette and his
brothers would go on to grow this com-
pany into the largest construction
company in Maine, providing thou-
sands of jobs throughout the State.
Now nationally recognized and 100 per-
cent employee owned, with locations
stretching into the mid-Atlantic re-
gion, Cianbro is still headquartered in
Pittsfield.
It is an honor and a privilege to con-
gratulate Pittsfield on this historic oc-
casion. For 200 years the town and its
residents have repeatedly dem-
onstrated the hard work and commu-
nity spirit found throughout Maine. I
hope the residents of Pittsfield take
the opportunity during this yearlong
celebration to reflect on their rich his-
tory and strive to make the next 200
years as prosperous as the last. Happy
200th birthday, Pittsfield, and con-
gratulations to all who have made this
a vibrant Maine community.∑

TRIBUTE TO T. MICHAEL PUTNAM
∑ Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize the Honorable T. Mi-
chael Putnam, who is formally step-
ping down from his 32-year term as a
U.S. magistrate judge, effective on
June 7, 2019. Judge Putnam served the
Northern District of Alabama as a
magistrate and chief magistrate judge
during his many years of service to the
court. He is the longest serving mag-
istrate judge in the history of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3053
May 22, 2019
Northern District of Alabama, and I
certainly commend him for this accom-
plishment. At the time of his appoint-
ment, Judge Putnam was the youngest
magistrate judge in the country at age
32.
Instrumental in the expansion of the
role of magistrate judges, Judge Put-
nam worked to highlight their value in
the judicial process. He acted as the
chair and vice chair of the Northern
District’s Criminal Justice Act Admin-
istrative Committee, playing a signifi-
cant role in ensuring the highest qual-
ity of representation of indigent crimi-
nal defendants in the Northern District
under the Criminal Justice Act.
Judge Putnam is widely known for
his volunteer work at the Cumberland
School of Law in Birmingham, AL. He
has taught a pretrial practice and pro-
cedure class since 2006 and directed
many trial advocacy and moot court
programs. The Cumberland School of
Law named Judge Putnam the 2019 re-
cipient of the Friend of the Law School
Award in recognition of his time and
dedication to the betterment of stu-
dents at Cumberland. The Young Law-
yers Section of the Birmingham Bar
Association also selected him for the
Judge Drayton Nobles James Award in
2016, where they honored his spirit of
volunteerism.
As an advocate for the Northern Dis-
trict, Judge Putnam played an active
role in using technology to improve ef-
ficiency. He has been a judicial re-
source for the Office of the Clerk while
implementing procedural changes to
the electronic filing system. Judge
Putnam led the Court in establishing
the eVoucher system, making it easier
for attorneys and courts to process
vouchers for appointed counsel in
criminal cases.
Judge Putnam received his bachelor
of arts from the University of Alabama
and his juris doctorate from the Uni-
versity of Alabama School of Law. He
graduated in the top 5 percent of his
class and was a Hugo L. Black Scholar.
Judge Putnam’s contributions to
Alabama’s judicial system are truly re-
markable and will have an impact for
generations to come. I am proud to
take this time to recognize and thank
him for his service to the people of our
great State and his unwavering com-
mitment to the rule of law. I join
Judge Putnam’s friends, family, and
colleagues in wishing him the best of
luck as he transitions into a new chap-
ter of his life.∑

States Congress to pass funding legislation
that will secure the southern border of the
United States; to the Committee on Appro-
priations.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 114
Whereas, it is imperative that the United
States Congress pass the laws needed to pro-
vide the necessary funding for securing the
southern border of this great nation; and
Whereas, the growing crisis of illegal im-
migration threatens the security of United
States citizens; and
Whereas, in 2017 and 2018 alone, approxi-
mately 235,000 illegal immigrants were ar-
rested; more than half of those arrests were
for violent crimes against Americans, 4,000 of
whom were murdered; and
Whereas, each week, 300 Americans die of
using heroin that comes to this country
through drug smuggling at our southern bor-
der; and
Whereas, a high steel barrier along 234
miles of this nation’s southern border would
effectively prevent illegal immigrants and
contraband from reaching the United States;
and
Whereas, the Trump administration has re-
quested $5.7 billion for the construction of a
steel barrier along the southern border, $4.2
billion for detention center materials and
personnel, $563 million for additional immi-
gration judges and support staff to reduce
the backlog of immigration cases, $211 mil-
lion for additional border patrol agents, $571
million for additional ICE personnel, and
$675 million to prevent illegal drugs and
weapons from crossing our borders; and
Whereas, Congress has not yet responded
to the Trump administration’s request to se-
cure the nation’s southern border; and
Whereas, if Congress imposed a tariff on all
moneys wired by individuals with no proof of
citizenship or who are not in the country le-
gally, it would provide the funding for the
necessary infrastructure to secure the south-
ern border: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate, That the members
of this body urge Congress to pass funding
legislation that will make the security of the
southern border of the United States a re-
ality; and be it further
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate
is authorized and directed to make appro-
priate copies of this resolution available for
distribution to the President of the Senate,
to the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives, and to each member of the
congressional delegation from this state.

ate of the State of Georgia urging the United
States Congress to award the Congressional
Gold Medal to the World War II Merrill’s Ma-
rauders; to the Committee on Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 466
Whereas, in August, 1943, President Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill proposed creation of a
top-secret, ‘‘expendable’’ American ground
unit to engage in a ‘‘long-range penetration
mission’’ behind enemy lines in Japanese oc-
cupied Burma to cut off communications and
supply lines and capture northern Burma’s
only strategic, all-weather Myitkyina air-
field; and
Whereas, President Roosevelt issued a 1943
call for volunteers for ‘‘a dangerous and haz-
ardous mission,’’ answered by approximately
3,000 American Infantrymen from stateside,
the Caribbean, and the South Pacific, rep-
resenting 15 ethnic groups from every state
and including a Bataan Death March sur-
vivor, Nisei interpreters, a Native American
code talker, and Pearl Harbor survivors; and
Whereas, the top-secret unit, expecting no
survivors, was officially designated in Janu-
ary, 1944, as the 5307th Composite Unit Provi-
sional (CUP), code-named ‘‘Galahad,’’ which
later became known as ‘‘Merrill’s Maraud-
ers,’’ after their leader, Brigadier General
Frank D. Merrill; and
Whereas, in February, 1944, the Marauders
began their approximately 1,000 mile march
through dense Burmese jungle and up the Hi-
malayan Mountains with no artillery sup-
port, carrying only what they could pack on
their backs or mules, and would become the
first Americans to engage the Japanese on
the ground in Asia and the first Americans
to fight there since the 1900 Boxer Rebellion;
and
Whereas, the Marauders fought valiantly
during their five-month march to the
Myitkyina airfield, defeating the much larg-
er and better equipped elite Japanese 18th
Division in five major and 30 minor engage-
ments, and no other WWII U.S. combat force,
except the First Marine Division which took
and held Guadalcanal for four months, expe-
rienced as much uninterrupted jungle fight-
ing; and
Whereas, the Marauders endured starva-
tion, disease, monsoons, and isolation, which
were exacerbated by inadequate aerial resup-
ply drops, and malaria, typhus, dysentery,
and other jungle maladies inflicted more cas-
ualties on the Marauders than the Japanese;
and
Whereas, only several hundred Marauders
remained fit enough, after climbing the
Himalaya’s disease infested, 6,100 foot Naura
Hkyat Pass, to seize their objective of the
Myitkyina airfield, which enabled supplies
to be flown into Burma to connect the Ledo
and Burma roads so a crucial Allied pathway
could be forged into China; and
Whereas, on August 10, 1944, when the
5307th CUP was deactivated, without even a
formation, only about 100 skeletal-looking
Merrill’s Marauders were left in Burma with
the remainder evacuated due to jungle dis-
eases, exhaustion, and malnutrition; and
Whereas, for their bravery, sacrifice, and
success, Merrill’s Marauders were awarded
numerous medals and decorations, including
the Presidential Unit Citation, and each
member of the 5307th CUP has the ‘‘rare dis-
tinction’’ of being awarded a Bronze Star;

Whereas, although Merrill’s Marauders
were a short-lived commando unit, the leg-
acy of their bravery is honored by the
Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment, which traces
its lineage to the 5307th CUP, wears the
Merrill’s Marauders patch as their crest, and
named their military intelligence building
‘‘Melillo Hall’’ in honor of Georgia’s last
original Merrill’s Marauder, Vincent Melillo;
and
Whereas, Georgia is honored to commemo-
rate 2019 as the 75th anniversary of the
Merrill’s Marauders mission in the China
Burma India Theater, known today as the
Forgotten Theater of WWII, and salutes the
state’s large Ranger presence: the 75th Rang-
er Regiment, 3rd Ranger Battalion, and Air-
borne Ranger Training Brigade, all at Ft.
Benning; Camp Merrill in Dahlonega; and 1st
Ranger Battalion, Hunter Army Airfield in
Savannah; and
Whereas, U.S. Representative Peter T.
King (R–NY) introduced H.R. 906 with Con-
gressman Sanford Bishop (D–GA) as a major
cosponsor, and U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson
(R–GA) introduced S. 743 in the 116th Con-
gress, the ‘‘Merrill’s Marauders Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act,’’ and this third at-
tempt might be the last since only 13 out of
the original 3,000 Merrill’s Marauders are
still living:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate, That the members
of this body commend the 75th anniversary
of the WWII Merrill’s Marauders mission and
urge the Congress of the United States to act
favorably on legislation to award the Con-
gressional Gold Medal, the highest honor
Congress can bestow, to Merrill’s Marauders;
and be it further
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate
is authorized and directed to make appro-
priate copies of this resolution available for

Vice President Michael Pence, Speaker of
the House Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell, and each senator and rep-

ate of the State of Georgia urging the United
States Congress to eliminate the five-month
waiting period for disability insurance bene-
fits for individuals living with amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS); to the Committee on
Finance.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 276
Whereas, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) is commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s
disease; and
Whereas, ALS is a progressive and fatal
neuromuscular disease; and
Whereas, the average time to diagnosis is
more than 12 months; and
Whereas, the majority of ALS patients die
within two to five years of receiving a diag-
nosis; and
Whereas, approximately 6,000 people in the
United States are diagnosed with ALS each
year; and
Whereas, the incidence of ALS is two per
100,000 people, and it is estimated that more
than 20,000 Americans may be living with
ALS at any given time; and
Whereas, ALS occurs through the world
with no racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic
boundaries and can affect anyone; and
Whereas, military veterans are approxi-
mately twice as likely to develop ALS; and
Whereas, the onset of ALS often involves
muscle weakness or stiffness as early symp-
toms. Progression of weakness, wasting, and
paralysis of the muscles of the limbs and
trunk, as well as those that control vital
functions such as speech, swallowing, and
later breathing, generally follows; and
Whereas, there can be significant costs for
medical care, equipment, and home health
caregiving later in the disease; and
Whereas, under current law, individuals
must wait five months after becoming dis-
abled before their Social Security Disability
Insurance benefit payments can begin; and
Whereas, last year, Congress considered
legislation that would eliminate the five-
month waiting period for disability insur-
ance benefits for individuals with ALS, but
it unfortunately did not become law; and
Whereas, this body recognizes that persons
living with ALS cannot wait for benefits.
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate that this body urges
Congress to eliminate the five-month wait-
ing period for disability insurance benefits
for individuals living with amyotrophic lat-
eral sclerosis (ALS). Be it further
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate
is authorized and directed to make appro-
priate copies of this resolution available for

by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana
urging the United States Congress to take
such actions as are necessary to pass the Dis-

Pensions.
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 8
Whereas, the Disability Integration Act of
2019 has been introduced as S. 117 and H.R.
555 in the One Hundred Sixteenth United
States Congress; and
Whereas, in enacting the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (herein referred to as
the ‘‘ADA’’). Congress recognized that ‘‘his-
torically, society has tended to isolate and
segregate individuals with disabilities, and,
despite some improvements, such forms of
discrimination against individuals with dis-
abilities continue to be a serious and perva-
sive social problem’’ and intended that the
ADA assure ‘‘full participation’’ and ‘‘inde-
pendent living’’ for individuals with disabil-
ities by addressing ‘‘discrimination against
individuals with disabilities [that] persists
in critical areas’’, including institutionaliza-
tion; and
Whereas, while Congress expected that the
ADA’s integration mandate would be inter-
preted in a manner that ensures that individ-
uals who are eligible for institutional place-
ment are able to exercise a right to commu-
nity-based long-term services and supports,
that expectation has not been fulfilled; and
Whereas, the holdings of the Supreme
Court in Olmstead v. LC, 527 U.S. 581 (1999).

society as equal citizens; however, many
states still do not provide sufficient commu-
nity-based long-term services and supports
to individuals with disabilities to end seg-
regation in institutions; and
Whereas, the right to live in the commu-
nity is necessary for the exercise of the civil
rights that the ADA was intended to secure
for all individuals with disabilities and the
lack of adequate community-based services
and supports has imperiled the civil rights of
all individuals with disabilities, and has un-
dermined the very promise of the ADA;
therefore, it is necessary to recognize in
statute a robust and fully articulated right
to community living; and
Whereas, states, with a few exceptions,
continue to approach decisions regarding
long-term services and supports from social
welfare and budgetary perspectives, but for
the promise of the ADA to be fully realized,
states must approach these decisions from a
civil rights perspective; and
Whereas, states have not consistently
planned to ensure sufficient services and sup-
ports tor individuals with disabilities, in-
cluding those with the most significant dis-
abilities, to enable individuals with disabil-
ities to live in the most integrated setting
and, as a result, many individuals with dis-
abilities who reside in institutions are pre-
vented from residing in the community and
individuals with disabilities who are not in
institutions find themselves at risk of insti-
tutional placement; and
Whereas, the continuing existence of un-
fair and unnecessary institutionalization de-
nies individuals with disabilities the oppor-
tunity to live and participate on an equal
basis in the community and costs the United
States billions of dollars in unnecessary
spending related to perpetuating dependency
and unnecessary confinement: Therefore, be
it
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana
memorializes the Congress of the United
States to take such actions as are necessary
to pass the Disability Integration Act of
2019; and be it further
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution
shall be transmitted to the secretary of the
United States Senate and the clerk of the
United States House of Representatives and

HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 6
Whereas, West Virginia’s natural gas and
energy reserves and production have in-
creased significantly in recent years due to
the exploration occurring in the Utica and
Marcellus Shale formations; and
Whereas, West Virginia is now the ninth-
largest natural gas producing state in the
nation, providing five percent of our coun-
try’s total energy; and
Whereas, The natural gas and oil industry
supported over 70,000 jobs both directly and
indirectly and added $8 billion to the West
Virginian economy; and
Whereas, Pipelines and transmission lines
serve a critical role in delivering natural
gas, petroleum, and electricity in order to
meet our growing energy needs; and
Whereas, Denying the expansion and con-
struction of existing and new pipeline
projects would stop the significant revital-
ization of communities and manufacturing
industries in West Virginia; and
Whereas, The U.S. Department of Energy
has identified the benefits that West Vir-
ginia can accrue with the establishment of
an ethane storage and distribution hub to
promote diversity of supply and geography,
alleviating the strategic risk our country
faces as a result of a lack of redundancy and
flexibility; and
Whereas, West Virginia is business friendly
and welcomes investments in the state and
local economy; and
Whereas, West Virginia’s neighbors, in-
cluding Ohio and Pennsylvania, have bene-
fitted from using natural gas to attract in-
dustry; and
Whereas, The natural gas intensive indus-
try sector in Ohio has an output of $160 bil-
lion and Pennsylvania has an output of $156
billion in comparison to West Virginia’s out-
put of $18 billion; and
Whereas, Ohio and Pennsylvania have over
300,000 jobs in natural gas intensive industry
sector while West Virginia has over 30,000

HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 11
Whereas, The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and
others are critical to the economic and en-
ergy future of the State of West Virginia,
providing our state’s natural gas production
with unprecedented access to new markets;
and
Whereas, Studies indicate construction and
operation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline
alone will generate massive economic bene-
fits for West Virginia, including almost $478
million in additional economic activity dur-
ing the construction period and more than
$15 million in additional economic activity
each year after the facility begins operating;
and
Whereas, The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and
others will create thousands of new job op-
portunities for the working men and women
of West Virginia and significant new tax rev-
enues for many West Virginia counties; and
Whereas, The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and
others will help promote our nation’s energy
independence, helping make the burgeoning
natural gas production in West Virginia and
adjacent states more available to millions of
consumers and reducing the need for energy
imports; and
Whereas, The Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s en-
vironmental impact has been repeatedly and
thoroughly analyzed by state and federal
agencies, including the West Virginia De-
partment of Environmental Protection, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and
the U.S. Forest Service, among others, with
all of the agencies finding that the project
can be built and operated in a manner that
protects the natural resources of West Vir-
ginia and the other states in its path; and
Whereas, Despite the enormous energy and
economic benefits, as well as the positive
findings from a broad range of environ-
mental regulatory agencies, some groups
have launched an all-out assault on the At-
lantic Coast Pipeline project, with the ulti-
mate aim of forcing its cancelation; and

end all uses of fossil fuels in power genera-
tion; and
Whereas, These unwarranted attacks have
resulted in regulatory and legal proceedings
that have repeatedly delayed both the Atlan-
tic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply
Header Project; and
Whereas, In response to court orders stem-
ming from these attacks, the Atlantic Coast
Pipeline and Supply Header Project have
been forced to lay off or delay hiring thou-
sands of skilled construction workers in
West Virginia and also in Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Virginia and North Carolina, posing
significant hardships for working families
and depriving them of paychecks and steady
work; and
Whereas, The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
report estimates that these delays, through
August 2018, have already resulted in the loss
of $2.3 billion in the U.S. Gross Domestic
Product as well as $500 million in lost tax
revenue for U.S. states and localities; and
Whereas, The Chamber’s study also found
that the delays have already deprived U.S.
consumers of $377 million in energy cost sav-
ings; and
Whereas, The General President of the La-
borers’ International Union of North Amer-
ica (LIUNA) recently said obstructions to
the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and other vital
energy infrastructure ‘‘from activist groups
is costing our members jobs and the entire
country opportunities’’; and
Whereas, The LIUNA General President
also emphasized that the economic damage
caused by this opposition to new energy
projects is ‘‘being shouldered by the hard
working men and women who build our na-
tion’s energy infrastructure’’; and
Whereas, These assaults and delaying tac-
tics are also a direct threat to West Vir-
ginia’s energy production industry, which di-
rectly employs more than 22,000 men and
women and pays more than $6 billion in
wages annually; and
Whereas, Although the current employ-
ment and payroll figures are impressive, fur-
ther growth will be severely hampered unless
new infrastructure such as the Atlantic
Coast Pipeline and other pipelines are built
to transport West Virginia’s energy produc-
tion to market; and
Whereas, In addition to this economic
damage, the attacks on the Atlantic Coast
Pipeline and other interstate natural gas
projects have great potential to harm the en-
vironment, since other forms of electric gen-
eration powered by fossil fuels, such as nat-
ural gas, are needed to back up the expan-
sion of the intermittent generation from re-
newable resources such as solar and wind en-
ergy; therefore, be it
Resolved by the House of Delegates: That we,
the members of the House of Delegates of the
84th Legislature of the State of West Vir-
ginia, categorically condemn these counter-
productive and economically damaging as-
saults on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and
other urgently needed energy infrastructure
projects; and, be it further
Resolved, That we note that these attacks
are denying steady employment and income
to thousands of West Virginia workers and
their families who would otherwise be em-
ployed in the construction and operation of
the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related
Supply Header Project; and, be it further
Resolved, That we find that the attacks are
also damaging West Virginia’s energy pro-
duction industry, the source of more than $6
billion annually in wages to our state’s
working men and women; and, be it further
Resolved, That we find that the assaults on
these projects have great potential to dam-
age the environment by hindering the de-
ployment of electric generation powered by
solar power, wind and other renewable re-
sources, all of which must be backed up with
fossil fuel powered generation, such as nat-
ural gas; and, be it further
Resolved, That we strongly urge the groups
spearheading these assaults to stop their at-
tacks and delaying actions and in the proc-
ess help pave the way for a cleaner and

POM–72. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of North Da-
kota urging the United States Congress to
pass Savanna’s Act; to the Committee on In-
dian Affairs.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3041
Whereas, homicide is the third leading
cause of death among American Indian and
Alaska Native women between 10 and 24
years of age and the fifth leading cause of
death for American Indian and Alaska Na-
tive women between 25 and 34 years of age;
and
Whereas, in some tribal communities,
American Indian women are murdered at
more than 10 times the national average; and
Whereas, Native American and Alaska Na-
tive women are at least two times more like-
ly to experience rape or sexual assault and
two and one-half times more likely to expe-
rience violent crimes compared to all other
races, and those factors often are tied to
cases involving a disappearance or murder;
and
Whereas, the National Crime Information
Center reported 5,712 cases of missing Amer-
ican Indian and Alaska Native women and
girls in 2016, yet the United States Depart-
ment of Justice’s federal missing persons
database only logged 116 cases; and
Whereas, in 2016, North Dakota had 125
cases of Native American women and girls
reported missing to the National Crime In-
formation Center, with many cases likely
going unreported; and
Whereas, Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind,
for whom the federal legislation is named,
was a member of the Spirit Lake Tribe and
vanished when she was eight months preg-
nant; and
Whereas, Savanna’s Act will improve tribal
access to federal crime information data-
bases on missing persons and cooperation
among tribal, federal, state, and local law
enforcement, and will mandate the Attorney
General consult with tribes and submit a re-
port to Congress on how to resolve the bar-
riers tribes face; Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives of
North Dakota, the Senate concurring therein,
That the Sixty-sixth Legislative Assembly
urges the Congress of the United States to
pass Savanna’s Act; and be it further
Resolved, That the Secretary of State for-
ward copies of this resolution to the Speaker
of the United States House of Representa-
tives, the President Pro Tempore of the
United States Senate, and each member of
the North Dakota Congressional Delegation.

f
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and
Mr. JONES):
S. 1599. A bill to amend the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 to create a re-
fundable tax credit for foster families,
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Finance.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I
am introducing the Foster Care Tax
Credit Act, with my colleague Senator
Jones. Enacting this bill would go a
long way towards helping families with
the expenses that come with taking in
and providing homes for foster chil-
dren.
Currently, foster families are only el-
igible for the Child Tax Credit if the
same child lives with them for at least
six months. Many foster families take
in children for shorter periods, and
sometimes take in multiple different
children throughout the year. Even if
these placements add up to more than
six months, these families are poten-
tially not eligible for the tax credit.
Further, state funding for foster care
families often fails to cover the cost of
meeting the child’s basic needs.
The Foster Care Tax Credit Act
would create a new refundable tax
credit targeted at these families that
take in foster children but are not eli-
gible for the Child Tax Credit. The tax
credit would help ease the financial
strain that many of these families face.
Further, the bill instructs the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services
and Secretary of the Treasury to con-
duct outreach to state and tribal agen-
cies to better educate foster families
about provisions of the tax code that
may benefit them.
I hope my colleagues will support
this bill to provide assistance to fami-
lies who have chosen to offer a loving
home for children who need it most.
By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr.
RISCH, Mr. KING, Mr. CRAPO,
Mr. MERKLEY, and Ms. COL-
LINS):
S. 1614. A bill to amend the Clean Air
Act to modify the definition of ‘‘renew-
able biomass’’ under the renewable fuel
program; to the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works.
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Orego-
nians have a strong interest in using
biomass as a source of renewable fuels.
This desire, coupled with how well we
grow biomass in Oregon, creates the
opportunity to use carefully selected
wood waste as a source for cleaner
transportation fuel. If we do it right,
this effort will lead to healthier for-
ests, more carbon sequestration, clean-
er transportation fuels as compared to
traditional gasolines, and protected old
growth forests.
Current law excludes the use of fed-
eral biomass in the making of renew-
able fuels as defined by the Renewable
Fuel Standard (RFS). The bill being in-
troduced today eliminates that exclu-
sion.
In addition to being an energy mat-
ter, this is an important forest man-
agement issue. Over many decades
there has been an unnatural buildup of
woody material on the forest floor. It
becomes fuel for catastrophic wildfires.
For months, each summer, Oregonians
in every corner of the state, from
Astoria to Adel and from Medford to
Madras, suffer from smokey skies, haz-
ardous air quality, and the almost con-
stant threat that a wildfire may burn
down their homes. In the eastern por-
tion of the state, invasive species like
juniper trees pose challenges, on both
private and public lands—lowering
water tables, posing fire risks, and en-
croaching on sage grouse habitat. It is
time we stopped putting our heads in
the sand, hoping the environmental
ship will right itself.
Instead, this excess woody biomass
should be contributing to U.S. energy
independence by being converted to
transportation or electricity fuels.
This bill makes that economically fea-
sible. It would make it more cost effi-
cient for private landowners to remove
low-value brush, like juniper. The bill
also helps pay for programs to reduce
dead and dying trees that fuel cata-
strophic wildfires and helps thin out
unhealthy second-growth forests. The
bill ensures that all residuals from the
milling process and certain biomass
from national forests and BLM forests
qualify for the RFS standards.
Importantly, under this new defini-
tion biomass materials harvested from
federal lands must be done so in ac-
cordance with all federal laws, regula-
tions, and land-use plans and designa-
tions. In addition, the bill pays specific
attention to biomass removal from in-
sect and disease ridden forests and
wildfire prone areas. And, to ensure en-
vironmental problems are being solved,
not created, the bill restricts the types
of biomass materials that can be har-
vested from federal lands so that old
growth trees and stands will continue
to be protected.
At the end of the day, the small di-
ameter trees, the limbs, the debris,
even sawdust at the mill presents real
opportunities to generate green energy,
generate green jobs, lower wildfire
risks in rural areas across the country,
and better position the United States
to meet the RFS.
There is a lot of bipartisan support
for the biomass definition in this bill.
It balances sound energy policy with
sound environmental policy.
I want to thank my colleagues Sen-
ators RISCH, KING, CRAPO, and
MERKLEY for joining me on this impor-
tant bill.
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr.
HEINRICH, Ms. SMITH, Mr. GARD-
NER, Mr. COONS, Ms. MCSALLY,
and Mr. KING):
S. 1602. A bill to amend the United
States Energy Storage Competitive-
ness Act of 2007 to establish a research,
development, and demonstration pro-
gram for grid-scale energy storage sys-
tems, and for other purposes; to the

May 22, 2019
Storage Technology Act. I am pleased
to be partnering with Senator HEINRICH
on this initiative. I would also like to
thank Senator GARDNER, Senator
SMITH, Senator COONS, Senator
MCSALLY, and Senator KING who have
joined us as original cosponsors of the
BEST Act.
Our bipartisan bill supports narrowly
tailored energy storage research to de-
velop the next generation of tech-
nologies at the Department of Energy.
Advancing next generation energy
storage technology will allow us to in-
tegrate more renewables into the
power grid, such as wind energy or
solar energy which, in turn, will help
to reduce emissions and slow climate
change.
Energy storage systems provide a
wide range of benefits. First, these
technologies increase the reliability
and the resilience of the electric grid
by limiting potential disruptions. En-
ergy storage helps us to better manage
supply and demand on the grid and al-
lows for the expanded use of renewable
energy. The reliability of our grid and
grid-scale storage systems go hand-in-
hand.
Second, this type of technology can
decrease energy costs, a goal that we
all share. In Maine, the price of elec-
tricity rises steeply during the coldest
days of the year. For example, in late
2017 and early 2018, very cold tempera-
tures in New England led to higher en-
ergy costs—more than a billion dollars
in the wholesale energy market—in
just 15 days.
The next generation of energy stor-
age technologies could help to trans-
form our grid, meaning that we would
no longer need to generate more expen-
sive power to meet demands during the
hottest and coldest days of the year.
Instead, we could use more affordable
energy sources that have been stored
for later use.
Third, energy storage systems can
allow for more intermittent renewable
sources, such as wind and solar power,
to be placed on the grid and used pre-
cisely when they are needed. The Aqua
Ventus, a floating, deepwater offshore
wind project being developed by the
University of Maine and a consortium
of groups, could benefit from energy
storage innovation. Off the coast of
Maine, there are very strong and con-
sistent winds where offshore wind tur-
bines can produce electricity almost 50
percent of the time. This next genera-
tion storage technology will ensure
that we can use this wind power closer
to 100 percent of the time by storing
electricity to use when the wind isn’t
blowing.
One of the biggest hurdles to com-
mercializing energy storage is cost. To
overcome this obstacle, our bill specifi-
cally directs the Department of Energy
to work to decrease the cost of this ex-
citing technology. This is similar to
the Department’s SunShot initiative
that decreased the price of solar power
by approximately 75 percent in less
than a decade.
Furthermore, energy storage systems
are technology neutral. This bill will
foster innovation and enhance deploy-
ment of these innovative technologies
without picking winners or losers.
Specifically, our bill would do the
following: It would focus energy stor-
age research on highly flexible, longer
duration, and seasonal storage sys-
tems. It would support five energy
storage demonstration projects. The
bill would create a strategic plan and
allow the Department of Energy to de-
velop cost targets. It would coordinate
research and support the coordination
of research. Finally, the bill would au-
thorize $60 million annually for each of
the next 5 years.
I am pleased to report that our bipar-
tisan bill has earned very broad sup-
port, including the endorsements of the
Bipartisan Policy Center, Citizens for
Responsible Energy Solutions,
ClearPath, Edison Electric Institute,
Energy Storage Association, the Infor-
mation Technology and Innovation
Foundation, the National Audubon So-
ciety, the Natural Resources Council of
Maine, the National Hydropower Asso-
ciation, Solar Energy Industries Asso-
ciation, the Union of Concerned Sci-
entists, and the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce.
Frankly, it has been a long time
since I have seen a bill be able to at-
tract that much support from groups
that have different ideological goals,
and I am very proud that we were able
to line up the support of all of those
groups.
The BEST Act will help advance en-
ergy storage technologies to improve
the efficiency of our Nation’s electrical
grid while helping to promote the
wider use of clean, renewable energy.
The goals of this bill are those which I
would hope every Member of this body
could embrace. I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation.
Thank you, Mr. President.

SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS OF
ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC
ISLANDERS TO THE HISTORY OF
THE UNITED STATES

submitted the following resolution;
which was referred to the Committee
on the Judiciary:
S. RES. 218
Whereas the people of the United States
join together each May to pay tribute to the
contributions of generations of Asian Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders who have enriched
the history of the United States;
Whereas the history of Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders in the United States is
inextricably tied to the story of the United
States;
Whereas the Asian American and Pacific
Islander community is an inherently diverse
population, composed of more than 45 dis-
tinct ethnicities and more than 100 language
dialects;
Whereas, according to the Bureau of the
Census, the Asian American population grew
faster than any other racial or ethnic group
over the last decade, surging nearly 72 per-
cent between 2000 and 2015;
Whereas there are approximately 22,000,000
residents of the United States who identify
themselves as Asian and approximately
1,600,000 residents of the United States who
identify themselves as Native Hawaiian or
other Pacific Islander, making up nearly 7
percent of the total population of the United
States;
Whereas the month of May was selected for
Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month be-
cause the first Japanese immigrants arrived
in the United States on May 7, 1843, and the
first transcontinental railroad was com-
pleted on May 10, 1869, with substantial con-
tributions from Chinese immigrants;
Whereas section 102 of title 36, United
States Code, officially designates May as
Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month and
requests the President to issue an annual
proclamation calling on the people of the
United States to observe the month with ap-
propriate programs, ceremonies, and activi-
ties;
Whereas 2019 marks several important
milestones for the Asian American and Pa-
cific Islander community, including—
(1) the 25th anniversary of the establish-
ment of the Congressional Asian Pacific
American Caucus, a bicameral caucus of
Members of Congress advocating on behalf of
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,
which, in 2019, is composed of 73 Members,
including 19 Members of Asian or Pacific Is-
lander descent;
(2) the 25th anniversary of the establish-
ment of the Asian Pacific American Insti-
tute for Congressional Studies, which was
founded alongside the Congressional Asian
Pacific American Caucus by former Sec-
retary of Commerce and Secretary of Trans-
portation Norman Y. Mineta and former Del-
egate to the United States House of Rep-
resentatives from Guam Robert Underwood;
(3) the 40th anniversary of the first Asian/
Pacific American Heritage Week, designated
in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter through
Presidential Proclamation No. 4650;
(4) the 45th anniversary of Lau v. Nichols,
414 U.S. 563 (1974), in which the Supreme
Court of the United States determined that
inadequate supplemental language instruc-
tion for students of Chinese ancestry with
limited English proficiency violated the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, expanding equal
educational opportunities and paving the
way for bilingual programs and additional
English language instruction in public
schools;
(5) the 95th anniversary of the enactment
of the Immigration Act of 1924 (commonly
known as the ‘‘Johnson-Reed Act’’) (43 Stat.
153, chapter 190), which imposed national ori-
gin quotas that limited the number of immi-
grants allowed entry to the United States
and prohibited the entry of Asian immi-
grants; and
(6) the 150th anniversary of the completion
of the first transcontinental railroad,
which—
(A) in 1869, connected the Central Pacific
Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad at
Promontory Summit, Utah; and

landers have made significant contributions
to the United States at all levels of the Fed-
eral Government and the United States
Armed Forces, including—

Native Hawaiian ancestry;
(6) Norman Y. Mineta, the first Asian
American member of a Presidential cabinet;
and
(7) Elaine L. Chao, the first Asian Amer-
ican woman member of a Presidential cabi-
net;
Whereas, in 2019, Asian Americans and Pa-
cific Islanders are serving in State and Terri-

Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Ten-
nessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington,

(2) the Territories of American Samoa,
Guam, and the Commonwealth of the North-
ern Mariana Islands;
Whereas, in 2019, Asian Americans and Pa-
cific Islanders honorably serve throughout
the Federal judiciary;
Whereas there remains much to be done to
ensure that Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers have access to resources and a voice
in the Government of the United States and
continue to advance in the political land-
scape of the United States; and
Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific Amer-
ican Heritage Month provides the people of
the United States with an opportunity to
recognize the achievements, contributions,
and history of, and to understand the chal-
lenges faced by, Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes the significance of Asian/Pa-
cific American Heritage Month as an impor-
tant time to celebrate the significant con-
tributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers to the history of the United States;

TRIBUTES TO FORMER REP. RON
DELLUMS BY HIS COLLEAGUES
HON. STENY H. HOYER
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, on Friday,
May 10, 2019, the family, friends, and former
colleagues of the late Rep. Ron Dellums of
California paid tribute to him at a memorial
service here in Washington. Several of us who
served with him in this House delivered eulo-
gies praising Rep. Dellums for his decency,
his strength of character, his leadership, his
dedication to the men and women who serve
in our military, and the respect he earned from
his fellow legislators on both sides of the aisle.
I want to take this opportunity to include in
the RECORD the remarks I offered along with
the kind words spoken by Rep. BARBARA LEE,
Chairwoman MAXINE WATERS, and Del. ELEA-
NOR HOLMES NORTON. Majority Whip JAMES
CLYBURN also spoke, although unfortunately
there is no transcript of his remarks. I can at-
test, however, to his moving words.
Below I share with the rest of our col-
leagues my remarks in praise of our friend,
the late Rep. Dellums, joined by the state-
ments of others made in tribute to him:
Mr. Hoyer: Rev. Lamar and Father Conroy,
thank you for your words of peace and reflec-
tion. Cynthia, Erik, Piper, Brandon, and
Pam, thank you for allowing us to join you
in mourning Ron and participating in this
service today. To his grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, let me say ‘‘thank you’’
for the love you gave him, because we all saw
the joy it brought him.
I had the great honor to serve in congress
with Ron Dellums for seventeen years. He
was a friend, a teacher, an example, a hero.
He was always a gentleman. He was kind,
gracious, strong, and historic. Respected and
admired by his colleagues on both sides of
the aisle.
As Chairman of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, Ron Dellums was a man who knew
the purpose of arms. He understood that in-
struments of war could be guarantors of
peace. And he knew that the greatest force
was that of the moral being, the spirit of
good will and powerful words used to speak
truth.
When he saw the injustice of apartheid in
South Africa, Ron fought with every fiber to
arm Congress with truth and make our coun-
try an instrument of moral clarity.
When he and other African-American
Members saw an opportunity to raise issues
that were being ignored in Washington and
lift up voices that weren’t being heard, Ron
helped create the Congressional Black Cau-
cus that now serves as the conscience of the
Congress.
As city councilman, he drew on his own
family’s experiences to see the clarity of his
cause championing workers and their fami-
lies, the downtrodden, the forgotten, and the
dispossessed.
The people of Oakland elected Ron eleven
times to congress and then made him their
mayor—because they saw in him the kind of
moral leader unafraid to stand up for prin-
ciples and determined to do right by those
who entrusted him with high office. They
knew he would always speak up for them and
speak out for the causes he knew to be just.
Ron Dellums understood that the power of
words speaking truth—on the Floor of the
House or in Committee or in the City Coun-
cil chamber or from the mayor’s desk—could
be mightier than any armament. He was a
man who chose his words carefully and
wielded them forcefully.
President John F. Kennedy said of Winston
Churchill that he ‘‘marshalled the English
language and sent it into battle.’’ So too did
Ron. And we will remember him always for
speaking truth, speaking justice, speaking
goodness, and speaking for those who needed
a voice.
He was regal in bearing. He was real in his
relationships—warm and empathetic to all.
He was courageous in battle. Principled in
his policies. Moral in vision. Worthy of lead-
ing. Courteous in demeanor. Clear in his
goals. Loyal to his country, colleagues, and
conscience. Deserving of our love and re-
spect. A Teddy-Roosevelt ‘‘doer of great
deeds.’’ And, most assuredly, a man to be ad-
mired, emulated, followed, and—as we do
today, remembered.
Ron was our friend and our exemplar. We
were honored and blessed to be a part of his
life.
Ron: you were always faithful, Marine.
You were ‘‘Semper Fi.’’
Ms. Lee of California: To our officiant,
Rev. William H. Lamar IV, Father Conroy,
Reverend Skinner, and to all members of the
clergy.
First, let me offer my deepest condolences
to Cynthia, Brandy, Rachel, and Ron’s entire
family and extended family and Ron’s staff
who have and continue to experience a deep
sense of grief, yet hope that through the
celebration of Ron’s life, we all can join to-
gether and keep his legacy alive through our
work and love for each other.
I would also like to take a moment to ac-
knowledge my colleagues; members here;
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Majority Whip
James Clyburn, Congresswoman Maxine
Waters, Congressman Hank Johnson, Con-
gresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, Con-
gressman Gregory Meeks, and Congress-
woman Shelia Jackson Lee. Members, please
stand.
Our former congressional colleagues.
And Ron’s friends and constituents, and all
program participants.
I thank you for being here today as we cel-
ebrate the life of a man who was a states-
man, a gentleman, and an authentic rep-
resentative of the people. Also, Ron was my
mentor and my friend.
I looked up to him, like we all did, as a
warrior, and a fighter.
Ron never gave up his principles and integ-
rity, even though he was brilliant, a deep
thinker, a philosopher, and a man who—as
he would say—had a memory like an ele-
phant. He was a psychiatric social worker
who understood human behavior in its total-
ity and a proud former marine who dem-
onstrated that peace is patriotic.
He was a comedian too.
He was so funny—some of you may remem-
ber his Richard Pryor skit—Sandre, and I
were with Ron when he played the role of
Richard Pryor at Lou Gossett’s house.
What an evening—Ron became Richard
Pryor, and Richard Pryor became Ron.
Ron never let the weight of the world de-
stroy his sense of humor and fun-loving side
with his friends and family.
I first met Ron as a college student in the
early 1970s. I was going to school, raising my
two little boys while on public assistance
and developing my political consciousness.
I wanted to be an Intern in Ron’s Wash-
ington office once I was in graduate school
at UC Berkeley. I went to Ron’s District Di-
rector, our beloved, the late Don Hopkins
who Ron relied on and loved deeply, with
this request.
Don placed me in Ron’s DC Office during
the Watergate hearings in the summer of
1974. I learned a lot that summer, saw how
Ron, as a progressive African American man
from Berkeley and Oakland, navigated his
work as a legislator. Even though—as he al-
ways reminded us—they painted him as a
commie pinko from Berkeley and he was on
Spiro Agnew’s hate list—Ron wore this as a
badge of honor. He knew he came to Con-
gress as an Anti-war, peace candidate, who
knew the priorities of our country were
wrong and destroying people’s lives here at
home & abroad.
In 1975, I came to Washington, D.C. to work
on Ron’s staff. In those days, it was rare for
a woman—let alone a black woman—to run a
congressional office. But Ron was proud to
call himself a ‘‘feminist’’ and lived his life by
the same progressive values he espoused on
the House floor.
As an ardent anti-war activist, he also
sought a seat on the Armed Services Com-
mittee to advocate for alternatives to mili-
tary intervention.
Years later, Ron went on to make history
as the first African American to chair the
Armed Services Committee—and he used
that position to advocate for more just and
humane military policies. I travelled with
Ron, along with his staff throughout the
world. Heads of State wanted his advice and
knew he was a global leader.
I remember him telling his staff ‘‘Let your
conscience be your guide. If you are right—
just to stand on that street corner alone be-
cause sooner or later everyone must walk
right to you.’’ I’d like to ask Ron’s staff—
Congressional and Mayoral—to stand. Ron
loved his staff. They are all true public serv-
ants who gave their all to our community,
the country, and the world.
Ron demonstrated this repeatedly—he in-
troduced the South African sanctions legis-
lation 13 times.
It was the first override of a presidential
policy veto in the 20th century and finally
put the United States on the right side of
history.
I will always remember Ron calling me
after I was elected to Congress to come to
his beautiful home for dinner. Yes—he also
was a great cook.
Well, we sat at his kitchen table and asked
me to think about introducing an AIDS mar-
tial plan for Africa given the devastating
HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa. His idea led to
my legislation establishing the global fund
and PEPFAR which has saved millions of
lives. He worked so hard to help me get these
bills passed and the world owes him a debt of
gratitude.
Ron was my boss, mentor, and yet, like the
brother I never had. He gave me personal ad-
vice and support as a single Mom raising two
boys.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E652 May 22, 2019
When my son Craig graduated from Brent
Elementary School, in the sixth grade here
in Washington, DC., he asked Ron to be the
graduation speaker. Ron left Capitol Hill,
spoke at the graduation, took pictures and
spent time with the kids afterward. Mind
you, they were young children. They didn’t
have any political clout and couldn’t vote.
Ron did this out of the goodness of his
heart because he loved children and cared
about their future.
My sons Craig and Tony were childhood
friends with Ron’s kids Brandy, Eric, &
Piper, and to this day they remain close
friends.
Also, as a single woman in Washington,
DC, Ron counseled me on who—and who not
to date.
He saved me from a lot of trouble and
heartbreaks.
We can’t forget that Ron was nominated
for President in the mid-70’s, in Cincinnati,
Ohio, but he declined the nomination for the
Office of the President at the National Black
Political Convention. Then there was an ef-
fort to draft him to run for president, in New
York,—I believe—in 1980.
Of course, he was conflicted—so was the
staff. We just knew he could win—but Ron
decided he wanted to continue serving his
constituents because he wanted to help them
achieve their dreams and aspirations.
And, as the father of Coalition politics,
which began in the East Bay, his leadership
was needed to continue to build coalitions
for peace and justice around the country.
When Ron called me and told me of his ill-
ness, I was devastated. In his generous man-
ner, he said he didn’t want to worry me and
was gentle and cautious in the way he told
me—preparing me for that sad day. But he
gave me time to be with him each week dur-
ing his last month. Thank you, Cynthia.
I spent my birthday last year—the evening
of July 16 after a legislative session—with
Ron and his family. He was in rare form,
telling stories, being the comedian that he
was, toasting our friendship and singing
Happy Birthday to me. He was frail, in pain,
but demonstrated a sense of hope and cour-
age—even as he knew he would meet his
maker soon.
After my next visit, which would be the
last, he talked about family and friends—
told me some of his secrets, and I told him
some of mine—encouraged me to keep fight-
ing the good fight and imparted more pearls
of wisdom.
As I was about to leave, I was reluctant to
hug him, knowing he was in pain. He reared
up in the bed and called me to him in his
playful way and gave me a big hug with tears
in his eyes.
As a brilliant, powerful, elected official, a
fighter, and a physical fitness champion, Ron
was also kind, gentle, and a humanitarian
who lived his life with dignity and respect.
He left this earth demonstrating that same
sense of dignity and courage.
He did it his way.
Ron passed me a blue baton when we an-
nounced in 1998 that I would run for his seat
upon his retirement.
The baton, which I look at often, reminds
me that all of us must carry that baton that
Ron gave us and run our mile in this mara-
thon for justice, for peace, and unity. So,
when we can pass our batons to the next gen-
eration, we know, as Ron said frequently—
we have secured their future. In honor of the
great legacy Ron has left, I’ll be introducing
the Ronald V. Dellums Memorial Fellowship
For Women Of Color In Science, Technology,
Engineering, Arts, Math, and National Secu-
rity Act. And we will get it passed.
Finally, let me say during moments like
this, as a person, of faith, I go to the scrip-
tures often for inspiration and hope.
2nd Timothy Chapter 4, verse 7 says: ‘‘I
have fought the good fight, I have finished
the race, and I have kept the faith.’’
Ron, rest in peace, rest in power, know
that we got your back.
Ms. Waters: By all standards, our brother,
Ron Dellums, was a truly exceptional human
being who consistently gave of himself to his
loved ones, his community, his nation, and
the entire world.
Reverend King wrote ‘‘The ultimate meas-
ure of a man is not where he stands in mo-
ments of comfort and convenience, but where
he stands in times of challenge and con-
troversy. In dangerous valleys and hazardous
pathways, he will lift some bruised and beat-
en brother to a higher and more noble life.’’
In both his public and personal capacities,
Ron embodied this standard of character,
purpose, selflessness, and service.
As an elected official, Ron was a bold pio-
neer, a true leader, and a stalwart advocate
for peace in the U.S. and globally. Fueled by
his extraordinary acumen and legendary elo-
quence, he built a stellar track record of
standing up for principle, righting the
wrongs of inequality, and empowering the
powerless.
Ron initiated his career in Congress as a
crusader for peace, taking on the establish-
ment by opposing the Vietnam War. He pres-
sured Nixon to end the U.S. involvement,
and exposed war crimes in Vietnam, earning
him a place on Nixon’s enemies list, of which
he was proud to be a member.
Ron was a pioneer in the campaign to end
apartheid in South Africa, proposing sanc-
tions as far back as 1972. He was fiercely
dedicated to opening hearts and minds in
Congress to the plight of the oppressed
South African majority. Together we fought
apartheid, with my bill divesting California’s
pension fund investments, and Ron’s bill di-
vesting U.S. companies’ assets and applying
sanctions against the repressive regime, be-
coming law just days apart, in Ron’s case by
overriding the president’s veto.
Ron called out racial discrimination in the
military and advanced diversity and inclu-
sion through innovations that opened doors
of opportunity to people who had been ex-
cluded. He championed the minority set-
aside program for Defense Department con-
tracts, enabling businesses owned by African
Americans, Latinos, and other minorities to
compete for a share of the DoD’s large pro-
curement budget.
Ron consistently advocated for peace, op-
posing expensive, excessive weapons such as
the B–2 stealth bomber, and the MX and Per-
shing II missiles. He called for funds for
those weapons to be shifted to cities, com-
munities, education, and housing. He op-
posed military intervention in Grenada,
Zaire, Burundi, Sudan, Angola, Liberia, and
elsewhere, and was an outspoken critic of
the Persian Gulf War.
Ron’s illustrious leadership was on display
as chairman of the Armed Services Com-
mittee. He maintained his commitment to
peaceful policy positions while allowing the
committee to work its will on the DoD’s au-
thorization and policies that he opposed. Ron
often voted against his committee’s legisla-
tion.
Ron’s principled passion was epitomized by
his speech from the well of the House sup-
porting the Civil Rights Act of 1990. In that
August 2, 1990 speech, which is still embla-
zoned on the minds of many, Ron implored
his colleagues to support the bill, declaring
‘‘this is throw-down time. This is the bottom
line. This is integrity. There is no substitute
to freedom and human dignity . . . there is
no substitute for justice.’’
Ron’s nature was just as resplendent out-
side the public arena. To his friends and all
who sought his counsel, he was a trusted
confidant, a source of strength, a bastion of
wisdom, and a compatriot in our shared
goals and dreams. His personal warmth,
thoughtfulness, and empathy were as much a
part of his essence as passion for peace.
When facing conflict, he remained dignified.
When confronting challenges, he remained
optimistic. When engaging opponents, he re-
mained congenial. Even his adversaries in
Congress appreciated him for being fair, re-
sponsive, thoughtful, and honorable.
I am grateful that I had the chance to
thank Ron for what he accomplished, rep-
resented, and taught us. Shortly after he left
Congress, we celebrated him at the Black
Women’s Forum in LA, not just because of
what he did for his district and for the people
of mine, but for all 435 districts. We envel-
oped him in so much appreciation and praise
that day—every bit well-earned and well-de-
served—that the eloquent orator was ren-
dered speechless, albeit only briefly.
To me, Ron was far more than a colleague,
compatriot, teammate, confidante, coun-
selor, and political soul mate, although he
was all that. To me, Ron was a true friend,
a dear and trusted friend, a brother, and I
loved him very much.
Ron Dellums will always be remembered as
the true article; a man of conscience, dig-
nity, and grace; a leader with the rare blend
of sincere humility and sublime intellect;
the peoples’ patriot who waged peace at
every opportunity; and a man who is ad-
mired and loved by more people, in more
comers of the country and the world, than he
could have imagined.
Ms. Norton: We celebrate our colleague and
friend Ronald Dellums at a time of historic
polarization in Congress. It is a good time to
remember the peace advocate who chaired
the Armed Services Committee with such
equanimity that he won the respect, even
the friendship, of those who opposed every
cause, of the many into which Ron poured
his considerable talent.
I first came to admire Ron even before
being elected to Congress from my work in
the Free South Africa anti-apartheid move-
ment. For 14 years, Ron did not relent until
he freed his landmark bill for South Africa
divestment, overcoming a presidential veto.
By the time I was elected to Congress, Ron
had already been chair of the District of Co-
lumbia Committee for more than a decade.
That committee is long gone, and nothing
would have pleased Chairman Dellums more
than its demise. But when freedom-loving
Ron Dellums first came to Congress, he knew
that if there had to be such a Committee, he
wanted a seat on it. Just as Ron sought
peace by serving on the Armed Service Com-
mittee, he sought to free D.C. from Congres-
sional control by serving on the D.C. Com-
mittee.
He joined the Committee during his very
first term in Congress. Upon becoming chair
of the D.C. Committee, Ron framed his serv-
ice as ‘‘an advocate, not an overseer of Dis-
trict affairs.’’ No sooner had Ron gotten to
Congress in 1975, in his very 1st term, long
before I even thought about becoming a
Member, he introduced the 1st D.C. state-
hood bill.
Ron would relish our progress today as we
close in on enough votes for the D.C. state-
hood bill to pass in the House this term. We
expect a vote soon in the Oversight and Gov-
ernment Reform Committee to send the bill
to the House Floor. When that committee
vote occurs, we will not be able to claim we
are breaking new or historic ground. In 1987,
more than 30 years ago Chairman Ron Del-
lums proclaimed ‘‘There should be no colo-
nies in a democracy’’ and led the District
Committee in a vote for statehood for the
District of Columbia that passed in his Com-
mittee.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FILIPINO
VETERANS FAMILY REUNIFICA-
TION ACT OF 2019
HON. ED CASE
OF HAWAII
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, today, with my
colleague, Mr. YOUNG of Alaska, I rise to intro-
duce the Filipino Veterans Family Reunifica-
tion Act. I also welcome the companion
version of this bill introduced today in the U.S.
Senate by Senator HIRONO of Hawai’i and
Senator MURKOWSKI of Alaska.
This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would
exempt immigrant visa applications of children
of Filipino World War II veterans from existing
caps and allow them to gain green cards on
processing and approval of their applications,
which are still carefully vetted in line with ex-
isting immigration standards. This bill will not
only assist these veterans in their senior years
but also provide a fitting recognition of their
critical service in the War.
In 1941, more than 250,000 Filipino soldiers
responded to President Roosevelt’s call-to-
arms in the Philippines and elsewhere and
fought for the U.S. during World War II. Many
of these brave individuals returned from the
War only to be denied many of the benefits
promised for their service, and they have
spent decades fighting recognition of their
service. Many such veterans became proud
U.S. citizens, though today there are only a
few thousand Filipino veterans still alive and
living in the U.S.
In October 2017, Congress finally awarded
the Filipino veterans of World War II the Con-
gressional Gold Medal to honor their service
to our country, but we must do more as we
promised. These Filipino American veterans
long sought to gain entry and citizenship for
their children, yet our immigrant visa backlog
has forced family members to wait up to dec-
ades and thus effectively prevented these
aging veterans from reuniting with their fami-
lies.
In 2016, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigra-
tion Services created the Filipino World War II
Veterans Parole Program, a temporary admin-
istrative fix that allows these veterans to re-
quest parole for their children or siblings.
Under this policy, they can live in the U.S.
pending processing of their permanent resi-
dent applications, which may still take years if
not decades. However, as these veterans near
the end of their lives, they deserve the cer-
tainty of a non-revocable permanent solution.
This bill would grant them that.
In this Asian Pacific American Heritage
Month and in further recognition of the selfless
service and contributions of Filipino veterans
of World War II to our country, I urge my col-
leagues to join us in supporting and passing
this bill.
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
JIMMIE ‘‘JW’’ ALESHIRE
HON. TIM RYAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Jimmie ‘‘JW’’ Aleshire, age
73, who passed away on Thursday, November
1, 2018.
Jimmie was a proud veteran, serving his
country in the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Infan-
try. He was also a devout man of faith and
was a member of St. Mary’s Church in Mineral
Ridge, Ohio. Prior to retirement in 2011,
Jimmie worked as a steel worker for RMI for
38 years, and was a former 6S coordinator
and continuous improvement facilitator at RTI
International Metals, Inc.
Jimmie was also a fighter in more ways
than one. He was a 36-year melanoma cancer
survivor, volunteered his time with the Niles’
Relay for Life, and served on the Board of Di-
rectors of Yellow Brick Place. He was also a
great union man, a part of Local No. 2155,
and served on school committees for both St.
Rose and John F. Kennedy Warren Schools.
A family man, Jimmie was a beloved grand-
father and coach. He was a track coach at St.
Rose and a softball coach for JFK and
Seaborn Elementary, while being instrumental
in developing the ball fields at JFK Warren.
Survivors include his wife of 52 years, Joyce
(Veltre) Aleshire, whom he married October
22, 1966; his children, Alise (Jason) Kent of
Warren, Christian M. Aleshire of Alliance, and
Justin (Crystal) Aleshire of Mineral Ridge; his
grandchildren, Isabella and Michael Kent,
Ryan, Noah, and Lucas Aleshire; his
granddog, Furious, and many nieces.
Jimmie was a great friend of mine and was
a one of my earliest supporters. He knew bet-
ter than most the power of collective action to
improve the lives of working-class people.
Jimmie will be missed.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF
CAVEY’S
HON. JOHN B. LARSON
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of
Cavey’s a restaurant located in Manchester,
Connecticut.
Cavey’s has been a mainstay on Connecti-
cut’s restaurant scene since it opened in 1933,
during the Great Depression.
For 85 years the Cavagnaro family has cre-
ated a welcoming environment with delicious
food and great friendship.
As a frequent visitor of Cavey’s, Steve
Cavagnaro, the current owner and chef, and
his wife Kate, have become dear friends. His
grandmother, Florence, originally opened the
restaurant, and Steve has continued to serve
her famous ravioli.
Over the years, the Cavagnaro family has
created a Manchester institution, where I met
a cast of characters, starting with Steve’s fa-
ther, Stephen Cavagnaro Senior, and ranging
from people like Raymond F. ‘‘Sonny’’
Damato, Jack DeQuatro, Bill and Steve Thorn-
ton, Neil and Elizabeth Ellis, Chris Powell, and
Bob Marcotte, who coined the phrase, and
preferred to be called a social chemist, not a
bartender.
Steve is the quintessential gentleman, eru-
dite and gracious. His humility underscores
the fact he is simplistically, as he’s said, not
a man of many words, but he speaks the lan-
guage of good food and wine.
To say Cavey’s will be missed after it closes
on May 24th, is an understatement. We wish
Steve, Kate, and the entire Cavey’s family well
wishes as they start this new chapter and
thank them for being the hearth where the
community could gather and know there was
always good food, good wine, and good fel-
lowship.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND
SERVICE OF JOEL JEAN
COURREGES, SR.
HON. DEREK KILMER
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the legacy of Joel Jean Courreges,
Sr., a decorated veteran and Kitsap County
community member, who passed away on
May 10, 2019.
Joel was born in France on March 15, 1950.
He attended Roosevelt High School in Seattle
and immediately enlisted in the Marines after
graduation. Through his decorated career of
military service, Joel attained the rank of Ser-
geant and served two tours as a mortarman in
Phu Bai and Danang, where he was wounded.
Returning home from Vietnam, he married
Kandace K. Hove and had two children, Joel
Jr. and Danielle. In 1973, he met his current
wife, Carol, and they were married, expanding
his family to include Deanna and Tami.
After his time in the military, Joel continued
to seek ways to serve his community and con-
tribute to its growth and vitality. He spent thir-
ty-six years as a truck operator before retiring
in 2006. Not long after his retirement, Joel be-
came a service officer for the Bremerton chap-
ter of Disabled American Veterans, eventually
taking on the role of Commander.
Through his work with Disabled American
Veterans, Joel served his community diligently
by outreaching, connecting, and supporting
veterans across Kitsap County. His work
earned praise and numerous accolades during
his tenure, including a Golden Tennis Shoe
award from Senator PATTY MURRAY.
In addition to his work with Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans, Joel also served on the Kitsap
County Veterans Advisory Board, helping
shape the County’s efforts in supporting its
many veterans who call our region home.
Madam Speaker, Joel set an example for all
of us who strive to serve and better our com-
munities. Even in the face of increasing health
hardship, Joel maintained a steadfast commit-
ment to working on behalf of veterans and we
are better off because of his great work.
I am honored to recognize Joel Jean
Courreges, Sr.’s great life and legacy of serv-
ice and send my very best to his family,
friends, and the staff of the Bremerton chapter
of Disabled American Veterans.

FAMILY ON RECEIVING THE
LEOPOLD CONSERVATION
AWARD
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON
OF SOUTH DAKOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam
Speaker, today I rise to highlight the Johnson
farm in Frankfort, South Dakota as the recent
recipients of the state’s Leopold Conservation
Award.
Alan and Mickie Johnson, with their son
Brian and his wife Jamie, farm 1,800 acres of
cropland and 500 acres of grassland in Spink
County.
Using various techniques and technologies,
the Johnsons intend to leave the landscape in
better shape than they received it. Working
with Natural Resource Conservation Service,
they have incorporated no-till farming practices
and switched to a variable rate fertilizer sys-
tem.
Using farm bill programs such as EQIP,
CRP and CSP, the Johnson family has dem-
onstrated that you can do the right thing for
the environment while remaining productive
and economical.
As this body debates solutions to environ-
mental challenges, we should reflect on the
accomplishments of those hard-working indi-
viduals who achieve conservation on the
ground.
I commend the Johnson Family on their
achievement as stewards of the land as they
raise nutritious food that many of us take for
granted every day.

RECOGNIZING STOP THE BLEED
DAY
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize today as Stop the
Bleed Day. For four years, the American Col-
lege of Surgeons Committee on Trauma has
been leading the way on training folks in our
communities about how to safely stop trau-
matic bleeding.
I was honored to host a Stop the Bleed
training here on Capitol Hill where we trained
almost 100 people on how to save the lives of
others and themselves. Because of this train-
ing, these folks are equipped and empowered
to assist someone before a trained medical
professional can take over.
Whether as a result of a gunshot, traffic ac-
cident, or other injury, traumatic bleeding can
be life threatening. Like with CPR training, the
hope is that the training will never be put into
use. However, should a tragedy occur, those
who have taken the Stop the Bleed training
just might save a life.
I hope all of my colleagues here today will
join me in recognizing Stop the Bleed Day,
commending the American College of Sur-
geons, and think about hosting training ses-
sions in their communities.

represented. I was fortunate to work with him
firsthand as Chairman of the Aiken County
Council, where he uniquely ran countywide
fairly serving every community. Each year as
County Council Chairman and later, State

GI BILL ACCESS TO CAREER
CREDENTIALS ACT
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO
SABLAN
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the GI Bill Access to Career Creden-
tials Act, which would allow Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance
to cover the cost of approved preparatory
courses for professional license and certifi-
cation exams. By covering these courses
under the GI Bill, veterans and their eligible
family members will have better access to the
support they need to enter in-demand careers
in health care, teaching, technology and other
fields that may require government licenses
and certifications. To ensure quality and ac-
countability, courses eligible for reimburse-
ment must be approved beforehand by their
State Approving Agency based on current re-
quirements in law.
For the past 75 years, the VA estimates the
GI Bill has helped more than 25 million vet-
erans and their families nationwide including
the Marianas achieve their educational and
career goals. During this time, Congress ex-
panded the GI Bill to cover non-tuition ex-
penses such as college admissions test fees,
admissions test preparatory courses and exam
fees for licenses and certifications. While the
more than 5,700 GI Bill students across the
country over the last year and half used their
license and certification exam fees reimburse-
ment benefit according to the VA, courses de-
signed to help them pass these tests, such as
a $400 nurse licensing exam course offered
by Northern Marianas College, are not reim-
bursable. Not all students pass these exams
on their first attempt which is why the GI Bill
must be updated so VA educational assist-
ance covers both preparatory courses and re-
imbursement of test fees for licenses and cer-
tifications.
Around 20 to 30 percent of graduating sen-
iors each year enter the military according to
the Marianas Public School System. When
these future veterans transition to civilian life,
the GI Bill benefits they earned should help
prepare them to succeed in an economy in-
creasingly reliant on technical skills which
often requires paying for various tests, profes-
sional licenses, and other credentials. The
gentleman from Indiana, Mr. BANKS, is an
original cosponsor of the bill. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan legislation,
endorsed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars,
which will help veterans and their eligible fam-
ily members access the necessary credentials
to make their educational and career dreams
a reality.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT
OF TERRY NORWOOD
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the retirement of Terry
Norwood from the Mississippi Farm Bureau
Federation (MFBF).
Mr. Norwood, a native of Union County,
Mississippi, was born on December 27, 1951.
He was raised on a dairy and cotton farm in
Rockyford, Mississippi now known as Etta,
Mississippi. It was here that Mr. Norwood’s
love for agriculture sparked. In 1969, Mr. Nor-
wood graduated from West Union High School
and attended Northeast Mississippi Junior Col-
lege. After his two years at Northeast, Mr.
Norwood earned his Bachelor of Science in
Agriculture Education and Agriculture Engi-
neering from Mississippi State University. Mr.
Norwood subsequently earned a Masters De-
gree in Agriculture and Extension Education.
On June 1, 1993, Mr. Norwood joined the
Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation as a
Fieldman and Regional Manager. He re-
mained faithful in his commitment to MFBF for
26 years. Under his leadership, there has
been 5 Achievement Award winners, 5 Discus-
sion Meet winners, 2 Excellent in Ag winners,
and 3 Farm Women of the Year winners.
Leadership is often measured by what that in-
dividual achieves but a true leader is meas-
ured by what his subordinates achieve. The
amount of awards people received under his
leadership speaks volumes of the man and
leader Mr. Norwood is.
In March of 1977, Mr. Norwood married his
better half, Debbie McNabb Norwood and
have spent 43 years happily married. Together
they have three kids, Franklin, Dr. Allison, and
Jacob. Mr. and Mrs. Norwood own and oper-
ate Rockyford Farms and Rockford Sorghum
Mill, where they have produced sweet sor-
ghum syrup called ‘‘Moonlite Gold’’ for 39
years with no intentions of stopping anytime
soon.
Mr. Norwood has selflessly served his com-
munity and state for years, and I wish him and
his family many years of health and happi-
ness.

HON. WARREN DAVIDSON
OF OHIO

Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life of a great man.
Born in Piqua, Ohio, Father Angelo Caserta,
was the oldest active priest in the Archdiocese
of Cincinnati. He peacefully passed away last
week.
Those who knew Father Caserta recall his
talent for people, his comforting words, and
his love for our community.
When asked about the secret to his lon-
gevity, Father Caserta said, ‘‘My secret is the
good Lord. The Lord gets all the credit. I’m the
only classmate surviving in my class. Not
many average that milestone. It’s a celebration
of God’s goodness. How He could choose
someone like me and take care of me for 70
years while doing His work in the priesthood.’’
While I did not know Father Caserta person-
ally, I know of his deeds by those who did,
and the love he had for our community.
Madam Speaker, I honor Father Caserta’s
life of service, and extend my condolences to
those who knew him.

HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, it is my
pleasure to recognize Two River Theater on
its 25th Anniversary and join its leadership,
staff and Board of Trustees in honoring its
founders, Joan and Robert Rechnitz.
Founded in 1994 by Joan and Robert (Bob)
Rechnitz, Two River Theater continues to
bring art, culture and vitality to the greater Red
Bank community. Two River Theater is a pre-
mier regional theater, providing an outstanding
educational and recreational resource for the
greater Monmouth County area. Its efforts to
introduce theater to a broader audience and
represent the diversity of the communities it
serves are commendable. Two River Theater
remains dedicated to fostering new work and
imaginative interpretations of classics, sup-
porting the creative expressions of many lead-
ing artists. Its commitment to promoting the
arts has contributed to the thriving cultural
landscape of the community.
Joan and Bob’s commitment to the arts and
humanities extends beyond Two River The-
ater. The Joan and Robert Rechnitz Hall at
Monmouth University promotes arts exhibitions
and education and Bob continues to serve on
the Board of Trustees of the Philadelphia Or-
chestra, among many other philanthropic en-
deavors. In addition to promoting arts appre-
ciation and advancement, Joan and Bob are
stalwart advocates of land preservation and
conservation efforts as well as health care fa-
cilities and innovations, supporting the Mon-
mouth Conservation Foundation, Monmouth
Medical Center, Riverview Medical Center and
many others. Their impact on the community
is immeasurable.

Once again, I sincerely hope that my col-
leagues will join me in recognizing the con-
tributions and achievements of Joan and Rob-
ert Rechnitz and congratulating Two River

enriches the quality of life of Monmouth Coun-
ty and brings new visitors and artistic diversity

IN MEMORY OF MICHAEL
KOSKOFF, ESQUIRE
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the life and deeds of Michael Koskoff,
Esquire, a champion for civil and criminal jus-
tice who passed away on April 24, 2019. Mi-
chael resided in the state of Connecticut,
where his law practice achieved the highest
level of success for his clients in courtrooms
all across America, because his intelligence,
creativity, and high ethical and moral stand-
ards.
Michael was a unique attorney. His family
has been part of the trial bar over multiple
generations, but also he was the scion of a
family of stage performers. Some were actors,
singers and musicians. His father, Theodore,
was both his law partner and an accomplished
cellist. ‘‘We’re show people,’’ Michael once ex-
plained. He won record settlements in Con-
necticut negligence and malpractice cases by
coupling skills he had acquired in training to
be a Shakespearean actor with a lifelong an-
tagonism toward corporate greed. He also pio-
neered the use of vivid courtroom videos de-
livered in a documentary format.
For example, in 1979, Mr. Koskoff per-
suaded a jury in Danbury, CT, to award his cli-
ent $1.8 million in a wrongful-death case—
Connecticut’s first verdict of more than $1 mil-
lion in such a suit. In 1999, jurors awarded
$27 million for what he had demonstrated was
a bungled heart operation at Yale-New Haven
Hospital, which left a 29-year-old man perma-
nently blind and brain-damaged. At the time, it
was the biggest personal injury verdict in the
state’s history. In a medical malpractice case
that became the subject of a book, Damages:
One Family’s Legal Struggles in the World of
Medicine by Barry Werth, a couple rep-
resented by Mr. Koskoff settled for $6.25 mil-
lion in the early 1990s nine years after their
baby, who had severe cerebral palsy and de-
velopmental disabilities, was born at Norwalk
Hospital in Connecticut. (The child’s twin
brother had been stillborn there). In his book,
Mr. Werth described Mr. Koskoff’s courtroom
techniques as ‘‘raw theater.’’ ‘‘Koskoff liked to
depend on his own ‘visceral and instinctive re-
ality’ of what was happening in a courtroom—
was a witness nervous? arrogant? appealing?
unappealing?—to decide how best to keep the
drama fresh,’’ Mr. Werth wrote. ‘‘He also liked
to keep the other side’s experts off balance by
not letting them know what to expect of him.
If he met them, he might like them, and that
would dull his attack.’’
Madam Speaker, in addition to his success-
ful practice, Michael had a rich family life. He
married Rosalind Jacobs in 1963 and had four
children—two daughters, Sarah Koskoff, an
actress and screen writer, Juliet Koskoff a law-
yer in New York, and two sons Jacob Koskoff
a screenwriter who collaborated with his father
on the feature film ‘‘Marshall,’’ a rendering of
a criminal trial Justice Thurgood Marshall han-
dled as an attorney in 1941. His other son,
Joshua, is a partner in Michael’s firm who just
last month prevailed in a groundbreaking case
against the gun manufacturer Remington
Arms—a case that was brought by the families
of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook school
shooting.
Madam Speaker, Michael Koskoff brought to
life the promise of American ideals of fairness
and justice for ‘‘the little guy.’’ With all of his
success though, he never ‘‘put on airs’’ with
people he met. He was generous with his time
and support for his colleagues in the legal pro-
fession, the arts, and political causes devoted
to a better community and nation. His pres-
ence will be sorely missed by those who had
the privilege to know him, including myself.
However, it is safe to say his memory will
never be forgotten.
I would ask the House to please join me in
extending deepest condolences to Michael’s
wife Rosalind and his family for their loss.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONOR-
ABLE GORDON HELSEL’S RE-
TIREMENT FROM THE VIRGINIA
HOUSE OF DELEGATES
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of The Honorable Gordon
Helsel’s retirement from the Virginia House of
Delegates. His extensive history as a military
serviceman and a public servant exemplify his
selflessness and dedication to our great na-
tion.
In 1967, Gordon Helsel was drafted into the
United States Army and was deployed to Viet-
nam as an infantry soldier. Ten months into
his tour of duty, Gordon was ambushed by
North Vietnamese soldiers and sustained mul-
tiple injuries while returning fire on the enemy
position. Gordon’s injuries would require him
to spend five months in recovery and rightfully
earned him two Purple Hearts and the Bronze
Star. Gordon has been a steadfast advocate
for veterans and a tireless supporter of our ac-
tive duty military members and families. The
Vietnam veterans’ community has benefitted
tremendously from Gordon’s efforts and advo-
cacy and has an unshakable bond with him
and his family.
Since his military service, Gordon has pur-
sued his dream of owning a business, pur-
chasing the York Box and Barrel Manufac-
turing Company, Inc., which supplies con-
tainers for the region’s seafood industry. He
has helped many a seafood dealer and water-
man throughout Tidewater Virginia. Anyone in
the seafood processing or harvesting business
has come across Gordon and his fantastic
products. Consumers of seafood also greatly
appreciate the preservation of quality that his
products have provided to seafood lovers.
His service would continue at the local level
where he served as city council member, Vice
Mayor, Mayor, and Chief of Poquoson’s Vol-
unteer Fire Company. Gordon would eventu-
ally be elected to the House of Delegates in
2011, representing the 91st House District of
Virginia. His efforts in serving his community
on many levels has placed him as the quin-
tessential servant leader in the eyes of folks
through Virginia. His love of his country, Com-
monwealth and community shines through in
everything that he says and does. His commu-
nity loves Gordon and he loves them back.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
recognition of Delegate Helsel’s retirement
from the Virginia General Assembly. Words
alone cannot express our gratitude for his life-
long service to not only his community but to
his country as well. May God bless Gordon
Helsel and his family as he enters his retire-
ment.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JON
DOUGLAS STEWART
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the remarkable life of Jon
Douglas Stewart.
Doug was born and raised in Chicopee,
Georgia, and graduated from Gainesville High
School before earning his Bachelor of Arts de-
gree from Emory University. He later grad-
uated from Emory School of Law and was ad-
mitted to the State Bar of Georgia in 1962.
Doug practiced in both state and federal
courts throughout Georgia, and in 1968, he
began working at the Gainesville-based law
firm, Stewart, Melvin & Frost, where he was a
loyal partner for 50 years. As partner and sen-
ior litigator, Doug handled litigation ranging
from commercial contract disputes to domestic
relations cases and everything in between.
Doug was known as a steadfast leader and
mentor in our community, serving in many ca-
pacities and dedicating his career to teaching
and investing in the next generation of law-
yers. From 1981 to 1982, Doug served as
President of the State Bar of Georgia. He then
spent the next decade sitting on the Georgia
Bar Foundation’s Board of Trustees, serving
as both President and Vice President between
1983 and 1993. Towards the end of his tenure
as President, Doug was honored with one of
the State Bar’s highest accolades—the Distin-
guished service Award—in recognition of his
service, professionalism, and integrity. Just
last year, Doug was honored with the Thomas
O. Marshall Professionalism Award—the State
Bar’s highest honor.
As an active member of Gainesville First
United Methodist Church, Doug took great joy
in mentoring young leaders through teaching
Sunday school classes and serving as Chair-
man of the Administrative Board. He lived out
his passion for music by singing in the church
choir and participating in local theatre and mu-
sical productions.
Jon Douglas Stewart leaves behind an hon-
orable legacy of integrity, leadership, and
service. He will be greatly missed by many,
but he will always be remembered for his in-
credible impact on countless lives across Hall
County and beyond.

RECOGNIZING THE MONTH OF MAY
AS GBS/CIDP AWARENESS
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the month of May as GBS/
CIDP Awareness Month 2019 and ask my col-
leagues to join me in supporting the CIDP and
MMN communities through cosponsoring the
Medicare IVIG Access Enhancement Act.
The bill Act would provide much-needed as-
sistance to Medicare patients suffering from
two rare diseases, Chronic Inflammatory
Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) and
Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN). These
debilitating conditions are the result of a pa-
tient’s own immune system attacking their
motor nerves, leading to compromised mobility
and reduced quality of life.
Patients are frequently treated with intra-
venous immune globulin (IVIG), a plasma-de-
rived medicine that can significantly improve
health outcomes for these vulnerable patient
populations. Given the mobility challenges as-
sociated with CIDP and MMN, treatment in the
homes is the preferred site of care for many
patients.
I call on my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this important legislation by becoming
a cosponsor. The establishment of a home in-
fusion option for patients with CIDP and MMN
will help promote therapy adherence, enhance
quality of life and promote positive health out-
comes for beneficiaries with CIDP and MMN.

RECOGNIZING WORLD WAR I
VETERANS FROM COVINGTON, OH
HON. WARREN DAVIDSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I
rise to honor the contributions and sacrifices
of brave World War I soldiers from Covington,
Ohio, and its surrounding areas.
These soldiers fought with the U.S. Army’s
148th Infantry Regiment, 37th Buckeye Divi-
sion. In October of 1918, they fought in the
muddy fields of Belgium in the great battle of
Ypres.
Topping their trenches, the 37th faced a
hailstorm of bullets, bombs and poisonous
gas. Undeterred, they pressed the attack, pen-
etrating enemy lines. These brave soldiers
gained their objective and forced their foe into
a headlong retreat. At least nine servicemen
from the Covington area were killed or died in
military service during the war, including:
Orville Bazill, J. Lowell Boyer, Albert B. Cole,
Lloyd W. Cornor, Oscar P. Kindell, Edward S.
Knight, Arlie Carl Nicholas, Roscoe Rogers,
and Fred Siler.
At least fifteen more were wounded, most of
whom served with the U.S. Army’s 148th In-
fantry Regiment. Madam Speaker, we must
never forget the sacrifices of those who have
gone before us. I rise today to honor these
brave Ohioans, and to commemorate the
newly erected World War I Monument in High-
land Cemetery in Covington.

HONORING REX CAFÉ AND
BAKERY
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize the Rex Café & Bak-
ery in McAllen, Texas, and all of its distin-
guished employees. Rex Café & Bakery was
founded by Rogelio Guerrero over 70 years
ago in 1947, and I could not be happier to
have such a talented group of individuals cre-
ate jobs in the Rio Grande Valley.
Rogelio was born in Camargo, Tamaulipas,
Mexico, on February 3, 1908, and moved to
McAllen in 1918. Rogelio was a World War II
Veteran who served as a construction equip-
ment mechanic in the United States Army.
Rogelio was awarded the Asiatic Pacific Cam-
paign Medal with Three Bronze Stars and the
Philippines Liberation Medal with One Bronze
Star as well as many other awards for his
service. He was also an active member of the
American Legion, served as a member on the
advisory board of La Piedad Cemetery, and
treasurer of Woodmen of the World.
Rogelio left his legacy to his nephew
Baldemar Guerrero, Sr., who in turn left it to
his son Baldemar Guerrero, Jr. The Guerrero
family’s determination and hard work has left
a lasting impact on South Texas. Most cus-
tomers have visited frequently for years to
enjoy coffee, baked goods, comfort food,
among many others delicious meals and
treats. This, along with the top of the line cus-
tomer service provided by its loyal staff, have
made Rex Café & Bakery a pillar of our com-
munity.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to represent
the hard-working individuals of Rex Café &
Bakery and its founder, Rogelio Guerrero.
Their success is a shining example of what
the 15th District of Texas has to offer.

IN HONOR OF GABE LIPMAN
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the career of Gabe Lipman of
Norwich, Connecticut. For 35 years, Gabe has
dedicated herself to the education of our
state’s children as an art teacher in the Nor-
wich Public School District. Thanks to her,
generations of students have learned the
value of art in our lives and discovered their
own creative talents.
Throughout her professional life Gabe has
worked to improve the circumstances of oth-
ers. While that work was rooted in the class-
room, it was by no means confined to it. Em-
powering her fellow teachers through late-
night contract negotiations, serving as a con-
tributing member of the Norwich Arts Center,
and volunteering in the community have been
a central part of her career. After a lifelong
commitment to a single course, it is worth re-
flecting on the value of this undertaking.
Art and education, taken together, are a vir-
tuous combination that elevate our children.
Using this combination with her dynamic and
engaging teaching style, Gabe has steadily
enlarged the cultural opportunities for her stu-
dents. Every one of us has had a teacher that
has had a profound impact on our life’s direc-
tion. For all the students who were lucky
enough to be in her classroom, Gabe was one
of those teachers. The ripples Gabe has cast
across the community will never be completely
comprehended. But I can assure you this, they
are extensive and will continue moving out-
wards for years and decades to come bringing
exuberance and brilliance wherever they land.
Colleagues, I ask you to please join me in
extending your gratitude to Ms. Lipman for her
commitment to our nation’s youth. I thank
Gabe for her 35 years of service, and wish her
best of luck in the next endeavor.

IN RECOGNITION OF LIBERTY ELE-
MENTARY SCHOOL’S 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to
take this opportunity to recognize and con-
gratulate Liberty Elementary School in Spring-
field, Massachusetts on the occasion of its
100th anniversary. This milestone is a testa-
ment to the school’s faculty, staff, and stu-
dents who have not only undoubtedly shaped
the community of Springfield and beyond for
decades, but continue to do so every day.
Liberty Elementary School first opened its
doors to young students in Springfield in No-
vember 1918. It has now been nearly a full
century since that day, and the city has been
better for it ever since. For generations, Lib-
erty School’s teachers and administrators
have dedicated themselves to the education of
near countless children. These young individ-
uals have of course gone on to great things in
their own right. As a former history teacher in
Springfield myself, and current lecturer at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst, I know
firsthand the value of a good education. Our
country’s next leaders, thinkers, movers and
shakers depend on it. As the great Benjamin
Franklin once said, ‘‘An investment in knowl-
edge pays the best interest.’’ Liberty Elemen-
tary School certainly exemplifies this wisdom.
The school’s multifaceted curriculum and pas-
sion for learning sets students up for future
success in college, in their careers, and in
their life.
Once again, Madam Speaker, I would like to
offer my sincere well-wishes to the Liberty Ele-
mentary School community as they celebrate
100 years since the school first opened. Lib-
erty School has truly been essential to the fab-
ric of Springfield for generations and will be for
generations to come.
IN HONOR OF PENNY CHAUVETTE
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, May 22, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Penny Chauvette, who is being
honored as the Greater Manchester/Nashua
Board of Realtors (GMNBR) Realtor of the
Year for 2019. A valued member of GMNBR
for 31 years, Penny has served her commu-
nity with distinction, treating both her col-
leagues and clients with the utmost respect,
professionalism, and positivity.
The Greater Manchester/Nashua Board of
Realtors (GMNBR) is a local not-for-profit or-
ganization dedicated to promoting excellence
in the real estate profession by supporting its
members through education, community in-
volvement, civic duty, pride of professionalism
and advocacy. Over the past 31 years, she
has been instrumental in helping the board
achieve its critical goal. She has served as a
leader at the Board in several ways, sitting on
the Budget and Finance Committee and serv-
ing as the Chair of the Education Committee.
During 2018 alone, Penny made sure that her
Committee provided over 46 free continuing
education credits for the GMNBR membership.
She takes immense pride in serving her com-
munity with dignity and respect while inspiring
others to do the same. Penny is proud to al-
ways wear her realtor pin and highlight her
most valuable characteristic: her unwavering
and steadfast commitment to ethical behavior.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
thank Penny for her decades of dedication to
our community. I congratulate her again on
this well-deserved honor, and I thank her for
all that she does to make our state such a
wonderful place to learn, live, and grow.
