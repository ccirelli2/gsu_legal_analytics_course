taught by Your everlasting word.
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ him-

hath loved us and given us everlasting

Now unto the lamb that was slain to

now sits upon Thy throne forever, unto
him, Christ Jesus our Lord eternal.
Amen.

IN RECOGNITION OF COLONEL
(RET.) GEORGE W. STEUBER
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 29, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the career and service
of a dedicated military officer, civil servant,
and outstanding citizen, Col. (ret.) George W.
Steuber. Col. Steuber will be retiring from his
post as Deputy Garrison Commander at Fort
Benning on March 31, 2019, after almost a
decade of extraordinary service, and will be
honored in a retirement ceremony on Friday,
March 29, 2019, at 3 p.m.
Col. Steuber received a bachelor’s degree
in Sociology and Psychology from the Univer-
sity of Minnesota and master’s degrees in Na-
tional Security Affairs, from the Naval Post-
graduate School, and Strategic Studies, from
the Naval War College. In addition to his ex-
tensive academic background, Col. Steuber is
also a qualified linguist in Chinese (Mandarin)
and Thai.
For almost five decades, Col. Steuber has
been a well-respected and long-standing fig-
ure as an officer and civilian in our nation’s
military. He built quite an impressive career,
which began shortly after his 17th birthday
when he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He com-
menced his uniformed career as a private in
basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, later
completed Officer Candidate School, and then
served in several prestigious positions, includ-
ing the Colonel directing TRADOC’s Inter-
national Armies Program Directorate at Fort
Monroe, VA; a foreign area officer on peace-
keeping missions in Cambodia, Somalia, and
Haiti; a senior military advisor to the Czech
Republic’s Training and Doctrine Command; a
senior military analyst in JFCOM J–9 working
the Joint Urban Fires Program; and Garrison
Commander for Fort Sill (2001–2003). Then
as a civilian, he served as Deputy Garrison
Commander for Fort Rucker (2005 to 2009).
Col. Steuber has received several pres-
tigious awards for his outstanding military and
civilian service, including the Legion of Merit
(with Oak Leaf Cluster); Defense Meritorious
Service Medal (with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters);
Meritorious Service Medal (with 2 Oak Leaf
Clusters); Joint Service Commendation Medal
(with Oak Leaf Cluster); Army Commendation
Medal (with Oak Leaf Cluster); Vietnamese
Cross of Gallantry with Palm; Combat Infantry-
man Badge; Aerial Observer Badge; U.S.
Parachute Badge; Joint Chief of Staff Identi-
fication Badge; Royal Thai Army Parachute
Badge and Red Silk Aiguillette; Royal Thai
Army Command and General Staff Badge; Re-
public of Vietnam Parachute Badge; Superior
Civilian Service Award; and Commander’s
Award for Civilian Service.
During his tenure as Deputy Garrison Com-
mander at Fort Benning, he was instrumental
in the development of the newly formed Ma-
neuver Center of Excellence, oversaw imple-
mentation of the Base Realignment and Clo-
sure activities, provided support for the com-
plex integration of several key matters—in-
cluding all missions on post, Forces Command
in the inactivation of the 3D Infantry Division,
3rd Brigade Combat Team, and the reflagging
and activation of the first task force in the
United States, 1–28 IN Battalion.
Additionally, under his watch, annual serv-
ices and support were provided to more than
70,000 soldiers, civilians, and contractors in
five separate cantonment areas. He also pro-
vided guidance to all Fort Benning directorates
to ensure proper management of 141,000 ma-
neuver training acres, 15,800 range acres, 83
live fire ranges, 300 training areas, and 115
range and training area events, including com-
mand oversight for daily high-risk training
events.
Col. Steuber has achieved much success in
his life, but none would have been possible
without the enduring love and support of his
wife, Patricia; and their sons, Bill and Jon.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ‘‘Life’s
most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What
are you doing for others?’ ’’ Col. Steuber un-
doubtedly lives by this philosophy. From his
commendable efforts for our nation’s military,
both at home and abroad as well as on active
duty and as a civilian; his work has made a
tremendous impact in the lives of many.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more
than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second
Congressional District, in extending our sin-
cerest congratulations and best wishes to Col.
(ret.) George W. Steuber on the occasion of
his retirement as Deputy Garrison Commander
at Fort Benning and for an outstanding career
of civil and public service.

HONORING THE AMERICAN LEGION
ON THEIR CENTENNIAL ANNI-
VERSARY
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 29, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the American Legion as a
whole and specifically, the Lowville American
Legion Post 162 on their 100th anniversary.
The American Legion was chartered by
Congress in September 1919 after members
of the American Expeditionary Force, who
fought in World War I, convened to create an
organization to represent veterans of that con-
flict. Today, the American Legion focuses on
serving veterans, current service members
children and communities with a membership
numbering over two million from 13,000 posts
worldwide. The American Legion, under the
leadership of its National Commander Brett
Reistad, continues to grow and advocate on
behalf of those who have served our nation
with honor and distinction.
One of the very first posts to come into ex-
istence in the months following the creation of
the American Legion was the Lowville Amer-
ican Legion Post 162. The National organiza-
tion came into existence in March 1919 and
the Lowville post was founded just three
months later, in June. Since then, they have
been a leading post, sending members to
serve on national, state, and district commit-
tees. They have made an indelible impact on
the Lowville community over the past century
and I wish them continued success. On behalf
of New York’s 21st District, I want to congratu-
late them on this milestone and thank them for
their century-long tradition of service.

IN HONOR OF SUE BRICKER
DORN’S 85TH BIRTHDAY
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 29, 2019
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize
Mrs. Sue Bricker Dorn as she celebrates her
85th birthday this weekend. A longtime resi-
dent of New York City, Mrs. Dorn has fulfilled
the finest American traditions of family, faith
and service to community.
Born on April 21, 1934 to Barney and
Frances Bricker in Seattle, Washington, Mrs.
Dorn was raised in Seattle, Washington and
Portland, Oregon. In 1955, Mrs. Dorn grad-
uated from Stanford University, where she met
and later married Philip Henry Dorn. As the
Dorns settled in Southern California and Michi-
gan for his work in the burgeoning computer
industry, she got involved in the local commu-
nity. Most notably, in Warren, Michigan, Mrs.
Dorn was elected President of the League of
Women Voters and was even selected as
Warren’s ‘‘Man of the Year.’’ Mrs. Dorn later
earned a Master of Science degree from the
Bank Street College of Education and served
on the College’s Board of Trustees.
Mrs. Dorn began her career as a public-
school teacher in Long Island City, where she
taught students with special needs. Later in
her career, she pivoted to the development in-
dustry, where she served in high-level roles
for some of the world’s major cultural institu-
tions including Yale University, the Museum of
Modern Art, the Aspen Institute and New York
Hospital. Mrs. Dorn was also appointed to the
Regional Selection Panel of the President’s
Commission on White House Fellowships. In
the years since retiring, she has become a
tireless volunteer in New York City, including
with Central Synagogue, where she sits on the
Social Action Committee. She also played an
instrumental effort in the creation of New
York’s municipal ID program.
Finally, Mrs. Dorn is the matriarch of a
proud family. For nearly 40 years she shared
a loving marriage with Philip Dorn. Whether
known as ‘‘Mom,’’ ‘‘Nana,’’ ‘‘Tante,’’ or another
title, Mrs. Dorn’s home and ear are always
open to her son, daughter-in-law, daughter,
three grandchildren, five grandnieces and
nephews and more. Mrs. Dorn also remains
close with her siblings Monte and Nadine, with
whom she regularly travels. In her spare time,
she enjoys patronizing Lincoln Center, the
Metropolitan Opera and attending the theatre.
We are grateful for the spirit and service of
Mrs. Dorn. Her life has been a blessing to so
many in our local community, and it is an
honor to celebrate her 85th birthday.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Sue Bricker Dorn. Her life has

STEPHEN MURPHY
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, March 29, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Stephen Mur-
phy for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge
Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
Stephen Murphy is a student at Sobesky
Academy and received this award because his
determination and hard work have allowed him
to overcome adversities.
The dedication demonstrated by Stephen
Murphy is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and
perseverance. It is essential students at all
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will
guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to Ste-
phen Murphy for winning the Arvada Wheat
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
I have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.
