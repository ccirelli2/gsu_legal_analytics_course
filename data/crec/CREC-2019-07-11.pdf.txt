UNDERSTANDING THE
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I
love my country, and I rise today be-
cause it is important for us to under-
stand this impeachment process.
Whether you agree with the bringing of
impeachment or not, it is appropriate
to understand the process.
Today, I would like to share a few
words about the impeachment process
some 85 days since the Mueller report
was presented wherein Mr. Mueller all
but indicated that impeachable acts
occurred. I have my mnemonic notes
that I shall refer to.
The impeachment process itself
starts and ends in the House. The
House of Representatives and only the
House of Representatives can impeach
a President. It is very similar to an in-
dictment but not the same as an in-
dictment. Once the impeachment actu-
ally takes place, then the process
moves to the Senate.
Today, I am going to focus on the
House of Representatives. Perhaps we
will talk about the Senate on another
occasion.
The impeachment process is not an
appealable process. Once the House
gives its verdict, if you will—a major-
ity of persons present voting for im-
peachment—there is no appeal. It
doesn’t go to a friendly court that a
President might have. It won’t go to
the Supreme Court ultimately, where
some would contend that the Court is
divided along party lines.
I happen to think that judges ought
to vote based upon what they perceive
the law to be. I tend to give judges the
benefit of the doubt when it comes to
making their decisions, but there are
many who perceive this to be the case.
It is not appealable. It is something
that is totally within the province of
the House of Representatives.
This vote is a vote of conscience, and
this is where I would like to focus a
good deal of my energy today.
A vote of conscience means that you
vote based upon what your conscience
dictates. There will be no instructions
given to persons who will vote. Gen-
erally speaking, a jury would receive
some sort of instructions, indicating
that they should make certain find-
ings. There will be no instructions.
There will be no indication that we
have to do this based upon clear and
convincing evidence, that we have to
find beyond a reasonable doubt that
something occurred, or that we should
do it by a preponderance of the evi-
dence. There is no standard that will be
given to Members as they cast their
ballots. It is something that each Mem-
ber does, and it is a vote of conscience.
Now, the question can become,
‘‘Whose conscience will it be?’’ because
if you take another person’s rec-
ommendation and you vote based upon
that recommendation, then you could
conceivably vote another person’s con-
science.
I will vote my conscience. I will not
be guided by what others, who may be
voting based upon political expediency,
think. Members can vote based upon
political expediency if they so choose. I
will vote based upon a moral impera-
tive.
I will vote my conscience, and I will
do this because I believe that in this
country, the country that I love—I rise
because I love my country—that we
ought not allow any person to be above
the law.
The law of which I speak is Article II,
Section 4 of the Constitution. No one
should be above the law, but this is the
law that governs impeachment. No one
should be above the law, and I believe
that for some 85 days now since the
Mueller report, we have evidence that
the Chief Executive Officer has been
above the law.
There will be a vote on impeachment.
Each Member of this august body has a
preeminent privilege of bringing im-
peachment before the body. I happen to
be a Member, and I want to assure all
that impeachment is not dead.
I read a story today where there was
an indication that it has stalled or has
slowed. I want my colleagues to know
that I may stand alone when I do this,
as this is what my conscience dictates,
but I believe that it is better to stand
alone than not stand at all.
I will stand. There will be another
vote. I am asking that all do what I be-
lieve is expected, and that is to vote

to worry about the Supreme Court, and

f
RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT OF
BELLEFONTE OPPORTUNITY ZONE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, July 8, I had
the privilege of hosting the White
House Opportunity and Revitalization
Council Executive Director, Mr. Scott
Turner, in Bellefonte in Pennsylvania’s
15th Congressional District.
Mr. Turner shared his insight, his ex-
pertise, and, I will say, his passion for
serving economically distressed com-
munities, regarding the recently des-
ignated opportunity zone in Bellefonte,
with myself and members of the com-
munity. It was a productive and engag-
ing discussion hosted by the American
Philatelic Society at its headquarters.
Joined by officials from the U.S.
Small Business Administration, U.S.
Department of Agriculture, U.S. Gen-
eral Services Administration, and U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment, Mr. Turner shared a vision
behind the White House Opportunity
and Revitalization Council, or oppor-
tunity zones, as they are more broadly
known.
The Council was established to
proactively address the 52 million
Americans who live in economically
distressed communities nationwide in
urban areas, suburban areas, and, quite
frankly, rural areas.
It was inspiring to hear Mr. Turner’s
passion when it comes to stimulating
economic growth, expanding workforce
development opportunities, and pro-
moting long-term investment in dis-
tressed communities.
The opportunity zone designation
was made possible by the landmark
2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that I was
proud to cosponsor and to support. This
past April, the White House Council
was formed to help align communities
with a myriad of Federal agencies that
can help supplement public endeavors
with private investments.
Because of this, communities, and
not the Federal Government, are being
put in the driver’s seat. The borough of
Bellefonte is one of 300 opportunity
zones in the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, nearly 30 of which are located
within Pennsylvania’s 15th Congres-
sional District.
These opportunity zones were nomi-
nated by the Governor and are nomi-
nated by the Governors of each State
and territory. The final vetting and fi-
nalization for selection are up to the
United States Treasury Department.
Opportunity zones are an investment
in Pennsylvania’s future, our commu-
nities’ futures, our businesses, and the
people who call the Commonwealth
home. These zones have great potential
when it comes to revitalizing economi-
cally distressed communities all across
the United States. It is my hope that
they can become a catalyst for change
and a catalyst for hope in communities
across the country.
This facilitates investment by pri-
vate investors who can take their cap-
ital gains that they may have realized
because of business transactions that
they are engaged in. Normally, these
aren’t the types of communities where
these capital gains are invested. These
are areas of higher unemployment and
infrastructure issues, maybe housing
issues, and a lower median income, not
prime places for economic investment
by the private sector.
With the incentives of opportunity
zones, where these investors can invest
these capital gains within those com-
munities for causes and for needs de-
fined by the members of the commu-
nities, they are able to realize tax sav-
ings.
It encourages them to maintain that
investment for 10 years, where they
would pay zero taxes on those capital
gains and yield a tremendous return on
investment for families, for individ-
uals, and for communities.
Additionally, these 23 Federal agen-
cies would provide preferences for com-
petitive grants in these designated op-
portunity zones, another way of invest-
ing.
It was equally inspiring to hear local
stakeholders discuss their new develop-
ments in Bellefonte, and I am looking
forward to helping these communities
seek these Federal opportunities.
As I mentioned that day, this is a
program that was created by Congress
and was signed by President Trump,
who executed this with Scott Turner’s
leadership as Executive Director. It is
one that really lies in the community,
in terms of identifying what the needs
are and the investors who come from
the community.
I am grateful to the White House Op-
portunity and Revitalization Council
for its willingness to be on the ground
and engage, in the hopes of sparking
growth and development in all the des-
ignated opportunity zones. Specifi-
cally, on Monday, it was Bellefonte.
Moreover, I am grateful to the resi-
dents of Bellefonte for joining as en-
gaged citizens who are passionate
about the future of their town. By tak-
ing advantage of opportunity zones,
communities like Bellefonte can play a
more proactive role in the future and
the destiny of their town that they call
home.
f
IT IS TIME TO BEGIN AN
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, no
President in the history of our country
has ever been subject to as many cred-
ible allegations of illegal conduct as
Donald Trump.
Given the serious nature of these
crimes and the President’s refusal to
cooperate with congressional inves-
tigations, it is time for the House of
Representatives to begin an impeach-
ment inquiry.
The Mueller report documented com-
pelling evidence that the President ob-
structed justice, including numerous
attempts to shut down the Mueller in-
vestigation.
Despite the strong evidence, DOJ
policies prohibited the special counsel
from even considering bringing charges
against a sitting President. So, Con-
gress has a responsibility to act where
Mueller left off.
For the past several months, Trump,
his Attorney General, and congres-
sional Republicans have outright lied
about the contents and findings of the
Mueller report. The Trump administra-
tion has repeatedly rejected or under-
mined congressional subpoenas and ob-
structed the ability of Congress to get
the facts for the American people.
Launching an impeachment inquiry
is a necessary step to ensure that we
get to the bottom of Trump’s wrong-
doing. It honors the process that our
Founding Fathers enshrined in our
Constitution to empower Congress to
investigate and hold the President ac-
countable for committing high crimes
and misdemeanors.
I believe that impeachment inquiry
should examine the actions and con-
duct documented in the Mueller report,
but an impeachment inquiry should
not be limited to just those matters.
Congress has the responsibility to in-
vestigate the broad range of Trump’s
conduct as part of our inquiry.
With all the tweets and daily distrac-
tions, we cannot lose sight of the much
broader scope of Trump’s alleged
wrongdoing: more than a dozen accusa-
tions of sexual assault; campaign fi-
nance violations, including hush-
money payments; illegal foreign con-
tributions to the Trump inaugural
committee; illegal misuse of the
Trump Foundation charity for personal
and political purposes; welcoming for-
eign interference in U.S. elections;
mishandling top-secret information;
and abusing the security clearance
process for his son-in-law. And we
shouldn’t overlook how inappropriate
it is for the President of the United
States to engage in constant, daily
lying.
The list, unfortunately, goes on and
on.
Trump’s actions should concern
every single Member of Congress and
every American citizen, regardless of
what side of the aisle we are on. This
activity and behavior call into ques-
tion Trump’s fitness to serve as Presi-
dent of the United States and Com-
mander in Chief.

tion of the United States, and I will

RECOGNIZING OFFICER PIERRE
KING
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize a true American
hero, Pierre King, who is a police offi-
cer with the York Police Department
in York, South Carolina.
I say this because, on May 11, 2019,
Jamie Brock and his wife, Kimberly,
were having dinner at Longhorn
Steakhouse, celebrating their oldest
son’s graduation from the University of
South Carolina. While eating their
food, Jamie began choking and unable
to breathe due to experiencing an aller-
gic reaction to the food.
Kimberly, his wife, began screaming
for help, and Officer King, who was off
duty at the time, rushed to help the
choking man, whom he did not know,
and was able to use lifesaving tech-
niques that he had been trained to ad-
minister and was successful in dis-
lodging the food from Jamie’s throat.
Due to the actions of Officer King, a
life was saved, and in the words of
Brock family: ‘‘God put you there that
day, and you saved my husband and
you saved our kids’ father.’’
In the words of Officer King: ‘‘All I
knew is that I was not going to let this
man die, and he would do the same
thing for me.’’
Officer King is a true American hero
who epitomizes the slogan ‘‘to live is to
serve’’ and is an example for all of us
to follow.
When I think of Officer King, I think
of the words of Winston Churchill, who,
when Great Britain was about to be
under siege by Germany, said:
There will be a time when doing your best
is not good enough. We must do what is re-
quired.
Mr. Speaker, Officer King did what
was required.
f
THE CONTINUING HUMANITARIAN
CRISIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to call attention to the continuing hu-
manitarian crisis that is taking place
at our border between the United
States and Mexico.
Despite Congress’ recent effort to
provide relief to thousands of people in
detention centers, children continue to
be separated from their families, and
people continue suffer from a lack of
basic living standards that they need.
This is not the American way.
What is more, this administration
has just announced new ICE raids in
major American cities that will solve
nothing.
We need to do more. Congress needs
to act and seek long-term solutions to
addressing the problems forcing people
to flee their homes and seek asylum,
women and children literally moving
2,000 miles, and they are not coming to
Disneyland.
Congress needs to act. We should be
focusing on attacking the problem at
its source by increasing support to
Central American countries like El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras,
where the majority of these migrants
are coming from.
We should not be cutting foreign aid
to these countries. That just exacer-
bates the problem. I asked Secretary
Pompeo in a hearing of the Committee
on Foreign Affairs almost 2 months
ago: Why does not the President call a
meeting with the President of Mexico
and bring together the Organization of
American States to come up with a
comprehensive long-term solution to
this problem?
I have spoken with the Ambassador
from Mexico to the United States. She
has expressed to me the problem that
they are facing at their southern bor-
der with Guatemala. That is what we
should be doing, cooperating and work-
ing with the Mexican Government and
our other neighbors to the south.
We must also work to secure a basic
standard of living for the detention fa-
cilities to provide for immediate relief.
That is why I am cosponsoring H.R.
3239, Humanitarian Standards for Indi-
viduals in CBP Custody, to provide
house screening and emergency care, to
improve water and sanitation and hy-
giene standards, and to improve nutri-
tion and shelter standards.
These are things that we are doing in
the Middle East with the refugee relief
programs for the Syrian refugees. Why
would we not do this at our own border,
and increase the coordination and
surge capacity for the agencies to ad-
dress what the needs are of these mi-
grants?
We really do have a humanitarian
crisis at our border, to be sure. I think
we all recognize and understand that.
But, finally, we need to work to-
gether. We need to work together in a
bipartisan fashion. That is how Con-
gress should operate to achieve lasting,
comprehensive immigration reform.
When I first came to Congress, I sup-
ported comprehensive immigration re-
form with the Bush administration and
then with the Obama administration.
In 2013, we had a bipartisan package
that was very close to passage. As a
matter of fact, I think it would have
passed the House had the Speaker at
the time brought it to the floor. Unfor-
tunately, we lost that opportunity.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
their commitment to working to re-
solve this humanitarian crisis that we
are facing at the border. That is the
American way. That is what we should
be doing as Members of Congress.

PRAYERS FOR JACI HERMSTAD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Iowa (Mr. KING) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate being recognized to address
you here on the floor of the United
States House of Representatives. I
would first like to point out and to
show here, to America, Jaci Hermstad.
Jaci Hermstad is from Spencer, Iowa.
Her identical twin sister, in 2011,
passed away from an aggressive form of
ALS, which we often know of as Lou
Gehrig’s disease.
The DNA from her sister is part of a
treatment for Jaci, who was diagnosed
on Valentine’s Day of this year with
the same disease. And because of the
work and the cooperation of the FDA,
some wonderful scientists, and a lot of
work done by my staff—and I want to
stand here and thank Speaker PELOSI
for her cooperation—we were able to
convince the FDA to grant a waiver so
Jaci could receive this treatment.
She is in Columbia University, now,
receiving treatments. Her third treat-
ment is this morning, just about as I
speak, and it will be a triple dose. And
if this works—and she is in my prayers
every day—we have opened a path to
one day put an end to that deadly and
debilitating disease of ALS.
And by the way, she is a spunky gal
with a sassy sense of humor, and if you
knew her like I know her, you would
love her.
This is Jaci. She is definitely in my
prayers this day and every day.
CENSUS QUESTIONS
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I
would like to talk about the topic that
will be raised by the President this
afternoon in the Rose Garden, as I un-
derstand, and it is the topic of whether
the question of ‘‘Are you a citizen of
the United States of America?’’ should
and could be on the Census.
I have introduced a bill, H.R. 1320.
This has been introduced last time and
this year, and H.R. 1320 is a bill that
has asked these questions. It says:
What is person number one’s legal
status?
Are you a citizen or a national of the
United States?
Are you a lawfully admitted perma-
nent resident?
Are you none of those things, or do
you have an other lawful status?
And then it follows up and says: If
you have other lawful status, what is
that status? Are you here on a green
card? Are you here on a student visa?
Are you here on a work permit of some
kind?
So, we need a full inventory of the
population of the United States. That

was the purpose of the Census, not only
for redistricting, but so that we could
see how America is growing, in what
ways America is growing.
And, by the way, we are establishing
immigration policy here in the United
States Congress by an enumerated
power in our Constitution, I might add,
and we are doing that with people on
that side of the aisle saying: We don’t
want to know any more than how
many homo sapiens we can count with-
in the shores of the United States of
America. But they want to know a lot
of other minutia if it helps them politi-
cally.
So I brought this legislation forward,
and we know that there was a case be-
fore the United States Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court looked at that
case.
I looked back at the short form Cen-
sus in 2010 when Barack Obama was
President. And here is what it asked. It
wants to know: What is your name?
What is your phone number?
I mean, how detailed do you have to
get?
We are only asking are you a citizen
or are you not a citizen is what the
Commerce Department has decided to
ask. I think there should be more de-
tails.
But the Obama Census short form
said:
What is your name?
What is your phone number?
What is your birthday?
What sex are you?
I point out they didn’t ask your gen-
der. They ask sex because that is actu-
ally definitive.
And what is your ethnicity? What is
your race?
Do you have an unmarried partner?
And if you have children, they ask
this question:
Are they biological or adopted sons
or daughters?
So they want to know, are they boys
or girls and were they born into the
family or were they adopted into the
family. By what means are they part of
your dependents?
But you can’t ask a question: Are
you a citizen of the United States?
All of these questions and many
more, and we can’t ask the question:
Are you a citizen of the United States?
The Supreme Court found that the
executive branch was granted the au-
thority by the United States Con-
gress—and that is the Commerce Sec-
retary himself—to form the questions
on the Census. This is a constitutional
authority that was specifically granted
to the executive branch of government
by the United States Congress. But the
Court says: You have the authority to
ask the question, but we think you
have the wrong reason to ask the ques-
tion. So now we are remanded back to
the lower court to come up with a bet-
ter reason.
Here is my reason: We want to know
how many citizens are in America.
That is all you need to ask. It is simple
as it can be.
And they are well within the law;
they are well within the Constitution.
It is just that the Obama-appointed
judges don’t seem to be reading the
Constitution and the law, and they
seem to have political motives.
f
REPEALING THE 40 PERCENT
EXCISE TAX
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI) for 5 minutes.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise for
the working men and women in our
country who have well-deserved, hard-
earned quality healthcare benefits to
urge House leadership to bring to the
floor H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health
Benefits Tax Repeal Act. This bill
would finally fully repeal the 40 per-
cent excise tax on certain employer-
sponsored healthcare plans. For too
long, the tax has been a looming
threat.
Make no mistake, this tax falls on
everyday working families, including
laborers, operating engineers, car-
penters, pipefitters, painters, plumbers,
ironworkers, transportation workers,
firefighters, police, and many others,
many who have fought for and won
healthcare benefits in collective bar-
gaining agreements.
Among its many unintended effects,
this excise tax has helped encourage
the recent large increases in insurance
plan deductibles, which especially hurt
those with chronic illnesses.
This repeal bill has been proposed for
years. It is well past time to give it a
vote on the House floor.
The 40 percent excise tax on high-
quality healthcare plans was enacted
in the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The
ACA has had many good effects, but it
also had many flaws as enacted. We
need to make the ACA work better for
more Americans. And one provision
that needs to be fixed is this tax.
The tax was supposed to begin in
2018, but has been repeatedly delayed,
reflecting the awareness of its negative
impact. Right now, it is scheduled to
take effect in 2022. It is time to just
end it.
Regardless of the intent behind the
original ACA provisions, the truth is
that health insurance premiums have
continued to grow faster than infla-
tion, putting even plans with modern
benefits at risk of getting taxed.
As Families USA recently pointed
out, without a permanent solution, as
many as one out of every four workers
with job-based health plan coverage
could be affected by this tax by 2025.
That is just 6 short years from now.
Furthermore, responsible employers
plan ahead and are already gearing up
to plan their budgets for health insur-
ance in the next few years. This is es-
pecially concerning in the case of
workers who have successfully used
their right to organize to reach collec-
tive bargaining agreements with their
employers.
Good union jobs provide workers
with a better opportunity to negotiate
benefits that fairly reflect the impor-
tant contributions they make to the
American economy. Union jobs and
union contracts mean workers are fair-
ly compensated in the private sector
without relying on taxpayers and the
Federal Government.
But collective bargaining agreements
often span years, and the looming
threat of the excise tax puts these
hard-fought contracts at risk. Tem-
porary delays in the excise tax only
create more fear and uncertainty for
families as they wonder whether their
benefits will be severely cut back due
to heavy government taxes.
Delays also crimp employer budgets,
as businesses are forced to account for
the risk of getting hit with hefty
charges. By undermining long-term
collective bargaining agreements,
these delays also undermine the bed-
rock of the American economy: fairly
negotiated private contracts that all
parties know they can rely on.
Mr. Speaker, the American people
have shown us that they don’t want re-
peal of the ACA and they don’t want
important protections to be ripped out
from under them. They want the ACA
fixed. So let’s show them we are listen-
ing.
So, let’s show them we are listening.
Let’s show them that workers with
good, job-based health coverage will
not have to fear it eroding simply due
to government taxes. Let’s bring the
Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Re-
peal Act to the floor.

HONORING WILLIAM HENRY WARD
AND RICHARD LEON WATSON
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the heroism of two
Louisianians who served valiantly dur-
ing World War II: William Henry Ward
and Richard Leon Watson.
William, who recently celebrated his
95th birthday, grew up in New Orleans
and shipped off to Europe in 1943 to
join a heavy bombardment squadron
that participated in Operation Market
Garden and the Battle of the Bulge.
During the Battle of the Bulge, his
B–24 Liberator got shot down, took
heavy fire, and he was forced into an
emergency landing near Brussels. He
hitchhiked back to England and, as
soon as possible, rejoined the fight.
On January 10, 1945, he completed his
35th mission over Germany and finally
telegraphed his mother, Maude Ward,
saying, ‘‘Duties completed. Returning
home soon.’’
Sadly, Richard Watson came home to
Morehouse Parish in a more tragic
way. He died defending our country
while aboard the USS Oklahoma, which
sank from a torpedo strike when the
Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He
was one of 429 crewmen killed in that
attack.

After 77 years, his body was identi-
fied and finally sent back home to Lou-
isiana earlier this year.
Mr. Speaker, our World War II vet-
erans truly are America’s Greatest
Generation. It is because of the coura-
geous acts of soldiers like William
Ward and the sacrifices of sailors like
Richard Watson that we are the coun-
try we are today.
We owe a tremendous debt to our
World War II veterans.
I encourage everyone to thank these
wonderful people when you see them
and let them know that a grateful Na-
tion has not forgotten what they did

LET’S PUT SOME JUSTICE IN
TRADE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, Amer-
ica’s workers do not support the
Trump-negotiated NAFTA–2 trade deal.
Just like the original NAFTA, the
new NAFTA is half-baked, repackaged,
and broken. It was not written to im-
prove the lives of our working families
in Ohio or in Mexico or in Central
America. It was written to advance
transnational corporate interests and
the schemes of very wealthy elites.
In a country whose public and pri-
vate sectors too often serve the inter-
ests of the rich and powerful and not
the average person, this is the last
thing the working people of Ohio and
North America need, regardless of
whether they work in the mills or toil
in the fields.
The President’s promise of higher
wages and returning jobs is not to be
believed. NAFTA cannot deliver for the
working people unless it ensures the
dignity of labor, of labor rights, and
labor enforcement on this continent.
Our leaders must wake up to the
human suffering these trade deals cre-
ate, not only for our own citizens as
their jobs are outsourced but, also, peo-
ple who are exploited in Mexico and the
Americas.
When transnational corporations
crash together the economies of first-
and third-world countries, without a
second thought about the con-
sequences, it is the working people who
get crushed.
The ravages of NAFTA inflicted on
the Americas and their workers are
etched across America’s communities.
Far too many have been devastated by
the outsourcing of factories, many left
in economic ruin.
NAFTA was sold as the model of the
modern integration of first-world and
emerging-world economies. It was then
replicated in Central America with the
so-called CAFTA sweatshop deal, cov-
ering nations from which millions are
now fleeing to our border.
When multinational corporate inter-
ests dominate negotiations and place a
heavy thumb on the scales of economic
justice for labor across the Americas,
trade with our closest neighbors is
never a zero-sum game because too few
control the levers of negotiating power.
It is no surprise that nearly a half a
million migrants have been taken into
custody at our southern border this
year alone—half a million.
In the past, undocumented immi-
grants were overwhelmingly single
men from Mexico, but that flow has
changed. First, we experienced immi-
gration from Mexico post NAFTA.
There was a hemorrhage.
That has gone down in recent years,
but now CAFTA, the gift of CAFTA,
sees Central American families having
become the new face of undocumented
immigration.
These landless people, jobless people
from the Americas live in fear.
As America exports our trans-
national-driven trade models, we know-
ingly rely upon the human suffering
our economic policies inflict on the
poor.
NAFTA and NAFTA–2 were always
about cheap labor and bringing down
the benefits of health and pension ben-
efits for American workers.
Undocumented migrants arrive bru-
talized through trafficking channels.
Indeed, one can easily see, in agri-
culture alone in the Americas, the ex-
ploitative model of slavery has simply
morphed into a new serfdom under the
present system.
Once in the United States, many be-
come undocumented farm workers, and
the Department of Agriculture esti-
mates that about half of our Nation’s
farm workers are unauthorized, un-
documented.
These workers face great hostility
and black-market labor conditions re-
pugnant to our values. This undocu-
mented status makes workers espe-
cially vulnerable to abuse.
Is the answer to expand our migrant
visa worker programs, the H–2A or H–
2B visas? Absolutely not.
Take the tragedy of Santiago Cruz, a
Mexican labor recruiter brutally mur-
dered in a legal labor recruitment of-
fice in Monterrey, Mexico.
Santiago was communicating to his
fellow Mexican workers who sought
economic opportunity in America that
they did not have to pay a coyote $8,000
to get across the border—a crooked,
lone coyote.
Twelve years after his death near the
Mexican-U.S. border, Mexico has not
prosecuted his murderer and our coun-
try has not raised a voice to get justice
in his murder.
But the greatest injustice is the new
NAFTA deal that fails to address the
cancer of undocumented labor in the
Americas, especially in the agriculture
industry.
The current migrant worker system
is widely abused by employers seeking
a captive workforce. NAFTA–2 must in-
clude a comprehensive strategy to ad-
dress continental labor, and agricul-
tural immigration must be a part and
central to it, not absent.
The continental enforcement of
healthy working conditions and inte-
gration of enforceable labor laws must
be central to NAFTA–2. It is not in it.
That is the ugly exploitation of
America’s industrialized and farm
workers that we allow to continue.
How morally reprehensible is this?
I ask my colleagues to please take a
look at our bill and include a labor sec-
retariat in the new NAFTA deal. Let’s
put some justice in trade.

CONGRATULATING THE
EDWARDSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL
BASEBALL TEAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate
Edwardsville High School’s baseball
team on their Class 4A State cham-
pionship.
Edwardsville played Saint Charles
North for the title last week, going
into extra innings before the Tigers
won it all 3–2, claiming their third
State championship in school history
and their first since 1998.
With a 37 win and 5 loss season
record, Edwardsville came to the
championship game ready to win. At
the bottom of the seventh inning,
Saint Charles had a 2–1 lead with the
bases loaded and no outs.
Thanks to a double play, the Tigers
tied the game 2–2 and sent the game
into extra innings. In the top of the
eighth inning, the Tigers stole second
base and later laid down a bunt, which
led to a close play at the plate, allow-
ing the Tigers to score the winning
run.
When the Tigers took the field that
morning, Coach Tim Funkhouser had
699 career wins. After the game, he
came home with number 700 and a
State championship.
What a way to hit 700 wins in your
career. I congratulate Coach
Funkhouser and the entire
Edwardsville Tiger baseball team on a
fantastic season and a well-deserved
win.
RECOGNIZING ADOPTION LAWYER ELLYN
BULLOCK
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.

Ellyn Bullock, a lawyer from Cham-

tion. She has been nominated to be an
Angels in Adoption honoree by the 2019
Congressional Coalition on Adoption
Institute.
Since 1999, Ellyn has finalized the
adoptions of more than 1,800 children.
More than half were in the Illinois fos-
ter care system and ultimately found
permanent homes.
She has won the Catholic Charities
Friend of Adoption award and has been
recognized multiple times by associa-
tions for her advocacy of family values
and adoptions outside the office.
Ellyn and her husband, David, are
proud parents of three children: Kyle,

f
ANTICS OF THE IRANIAN NAVY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. OLSON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, this should
come as no surprise, but the world’s
champion crybaby, the Islamic Repub-
lic of Iran, threw another hissy fit this
week.
Their navy tried to hijack a British
tanker with a Royal Navy escort. They
admitted they were breaking inter-
national law because they demanded
the ship drive itself into their waters
to be boarded.
The Royal Navy frigate fired back
with a salvo from a radio. They said:
‘‘Back off.’’
The Iranian babies put their boats at
full speed, roaring back to Iran to cry
on the Ayatollah’s shoulder for their
humiliation.
This has happened over and over. And
I am very familiar with this region. I
deployed there in the Navy for 6
months, from May of 1994 to November
of 1994.
I was based on a small island called
Masirah right off the shore of the
United Arab Emirates. We would fly
what is called a gulf transit 1,000 feet
all around the Strait of Hormuz and
the Persian Gulf to exercise our free-
dom of navigation.
This is not the first time these things
have happened. The last attack hap-
pened right there where the baby is
crying. Two months before that, off the
map down there, four American tank-
ers, at idle, sitting in dead water wait-
ing to unload their cargo, were at-
tacked by Iranian boats, damaged.
In the middle of the Persian Gulf,
international airspace, right there near
the Gulf of Oman, one of our airplanes
was blown out of the sky by the Ira-
nians.
That was an act of war.
Ours was an American military air-
craft operating legally in international
airspace over international waters.
The question is: Why are the insane
Iranians becoming more insane? And
that is because the Mullahs who have
run their country now for 50 years
know they are dying. And, like a dying
animal, they are going to fight for
their last breath of power.
They are dying because of America,
the American energy revolution, start-
ed primarily and thriving in Texas and
the Permian Basin.
Oil is their only source of money in
the entire country of Iran. They have
nothing else.
The Permian Basin, by itself, next
year will produce more oil than every
country in the world except for Saudi
Arabia.
We have many more shale plains
across America: Barnett, Eagle Ford,
Bakken, Marcellus—over and over and
over.
b 1045
They know we are putting them in
the dumpsters of history. Uncle Sam is
forcing the mullahs and the leaders of
the military to learn new languages,
new words to explain their demise,
words like ‘‘good-bye,’’ ‘‘ta-ta,’’
‘‘adieu,’’ ‘‘adios,’’ and ‘‘sayonara’’ to go
with ‘‘khodahafez,’’ which, in Farsi,
means ‘‘good-bye.’’
I want to salute the people of Iran.
The dark times are going to end quick-
ly. You will be free from oppression
from the leaders in your own country.
I would like to give a salute to the
mullahs and the Iranian Navy and the
military. Good-bye. Adios.
And that’s just the way it is.
f
LET’S NOT RAISE THE MINIMUM
WAGE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
announced they will soon bring to the
floor the Raise the Wage Act, a bill to
increase the Federal minimum wage
from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour.
While supporters of this legislation
have good intentions, the repercussions
would spell disaster for our economy,
for small businesses, and the very same
low-wage workers who they intend to
help. Nonpartisan estimates of the
Raise the Wage Act expect it could
cause up to 3.7 million people across
the country to lose their jobs.
Mr. Speaker, that is almost as many
people as in the entire State of Okla-
homa, the entire State of Oklahoma
unemployed.
Cities that have already imposed a
$15 minimum wage have been the first
to see the negative effects of this ini-
tiative. Recently, the University of
Washington conducted a study on the
efficacy of Seattle’s newly mandated
$15 minimum wage, and the results
were very clear. Costs to low-wage
workers in Seattle outweighed the ben-
efits by 3-to-1, and the average low-
wage worker lost $125 a month.
While most of the discussion regard-
ing the Federal minimum wage is fo-
cused on major metropolitan cities,
what about the rural areas across the
country where the cost of living is
much lower? This bill would effectively
eliminate small, rural businesses and
skyrocket costs for goods and services.
Finally, let’s look at who is cur-
rently making minimum wage in the
U.S. Half are under the age of 25, and
almost a quarter of them are teen-
agers. A $15 minimum wage would
threaten the job prospects of young
folks who are looking to enter the
workforce for the first time, hoping to
gain the skills needed to move ahead in
a real career.
Over 80 percent of economists agree
that a $15 minimum wage would have a
negative impact on youth employment.
Look, I cannot support a bill that is
guaranteed to shutter business and lay
off workers around the country. I hope
that my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle will reconsider this attempt
to backtrack on the economic success
of recent years and, instead, support
bipartisan policies that will help all
workers get ahead.

WELCOMING DR. GEORGE S.
DILLARD, III
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the gentleman from Georgia
(Mr. FERGUSON) is recognized for 1
minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Dr. George Dillard,
whose leadership and guidance have
made him a valuable member of our
Peachtree City community in the
Third District of Georgia.
This is the second time that Dr. Dil-
lard has joined me here in the Nation’s
Capitol to pray for the Members of the
House of Representatives, and we are
extremely grateful that he did just
that.
George has been a vitally important
part of the Third District for over 25
years since he and his family moved to
Peachtree City to serve at the Peach-
tree City Christian Church, where he
still serves to this day.
George has been married to his wife,
Renee, since 1988. They have three chil-
dren and one grandchild. George and
his family live in Peachtree City, Geor-
gia.
I commend Dr. Dillard for his com-
mitment to our community and Na-
tion. There is not a week that goes by
where George isn’t a visible and wel-
coming part of the Fayette County
community.
The grace and love he has shown to
his parishioners and his neighbors
throughout his 24 years in Peachtree
City are unparalleled, and I am truly
honored to have Dr. Dillard here with
me today as he prays for our Nation.

RECOGNIZING PRIDE CAMP
(Mr. LOEBSACK asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Iowa Safe Schools’
second annual Pride Camp. This week-
long event invites LGBTQ youth and
allies from across Iowa to participate
in a summer camp where they have the
opportunity to learn new skills, con-
nect with their peers, share their expe-
riences, and grow as individuals while
also having fun.
This year, over 100 LGBTQ youth
from across the State will be attending
Pride Camp, despite this only being the
camp’s second year. This truly goes to
show the importance of programs like
Pride Camp, and I am proud that Iowa
is a leader in the fight for acceptance
and equality for everyone.
I want to extend my sincerest thanks
to Iowa Safe Schools for creating this
wonderful opportunity and for all of
their efforts advocating for Iowa’s
LGBTQ youth. Their work in devel-
oping a safe and inclusive summer
camp is making a difference in the
lives of so many young Iowans, and I
am honored to recognize them here
today.

ADOPTING NDAA AMENDMENTS ON
NATO CONTRIBUTIONS AND
ISRAEL
(Mr. BIGGS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, two amend-
ments I offered to the NDAA were
adopted.
The first addresses shared responsi-
bility for the world’s security. The
United States is the most powerful na-
tion on the planet and so must remain,
but our allies must pull their weight on
global security efforts. It is not just
Americans who benefit from peace,
after all.
For instance, is it fair for economic
powerhouse Germany to spend only 1.35
percent of its overall GDP toward
NATO defense in the coming years? I
don’t think so. We should at least ex-
amine the contributions of Germany
and all of our other allies.
My amendment simply requires the
Department of Defense to report the
annual defense spending of each of our
NATO and non-NATO allies.
My second amendment affirms the
critical importance of the U.S.-Israel
relationship. Since its founding over 50
years ago, Israel has been an important
strategic partner. Given the significant
challenges our Nation currently faces
in the Middle East, the U.S.-Israel rela-
tionship remains vital.
I thank Armed Services Committee
Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member
THORNBERRY for working with me on
these amendments.

COMPENSATING 9/11 FIRST
RESPONDERS
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, on September 11, 2001, as mil-
lions of Americans watched in horror,
our country was attacked. Thousands
of people courageously stepped up, left
their homes and families, and answered
the call to respond to a nation in need.
Among them were dozens of western
New Yorkers, including John Asklar of
the Niagara Falls Fire Department who
injured his leg in the rubble and con-
tinues to suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder; Jennifer Czarnecki,
who is reminded every day of her five
assignments to Ground Zero with the
New York State Police following a
breast cancer diagnosis in 2015; and my
friend Dave State, who bravely faced
cancer last year as a result of his 9/11
service with the New York State Na-
tional Guard.
For them and others, the pain and
consequences of this attack are as real
today as they were 18 years ago. We
must act urgently to make the 9/11 Vic-
tim Compensation Fund permanent.
These men, women, and families were
there for our country in our time of
need. Now, we must be there for them
in their time of need.

HONORING THE LIFE OF VERA
DULANEY
(Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of Vera
Dulaney who passed away July 5.
Last November, I was able to recog-
nize Vera on the floor for her retire-
ment and how much she meant to our
community. For more than 30 years,
she served the community through her
position as Scotts Bluff County clerk
and election commissioner, as well as
in various other volunteer capacities.
Throughout her public service, Vera’s
diligent work maintained the integrity
of our local elections and assisted the
effective and efficient operation of
Scotts Bluff County. Her outstanding
efforts across the community were re-
cently acknowledged when she was pre-
sented the Community Volunteer
Award for Public Service.
Vera was well-known in our commu-
nity for her years of official service,
humble demeanor, and dedication to
family. Her smile always lit up the
room. Her devotion to the Nebraska
Cornhuskers and Chicago Cubs was
only surpassed by her devotion to her
family and our community as a whole.
Throughout her long and prosperous
life, she touched countless others. Now
in passing, we celebrate her life and
keep her family and friends in our
prayers.

Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, my dis-

second-highest rate of childhood pov-
erty in America.
Children in poverty face over-
whelming barriers to academic success
because it is impossible for them to
learn when they are hungry or suf-
fering from family trauma. These bar-
riers are exacerbated in the summer

cational opportunities, causing them
to fall further and further behind aca-
demically.

summer. By the fifth grade, children
without summer learning opportunities
are 2 years behind their peers.
Students need a safe, stable place to
learn over the summer. That is why I
am so proud to have introduced legisla-
tion to help close the achievement gap
and reduce food insecurity.
The Summer Meals and Learning Act
will help fund summer reading pro-
grams at schools that already serve as
summer meal sites, providing the sup-
port and stability at-risk youth need to
grow and thrive. Every child deserves
the opportunity to achieve their goals.
It is my hope that this legislation will

IMPROVING MALMSTROM AIR
FORCE BASE
(Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to thank the members of the
House Armed Services Committee for
their hard work on this year’s National
Defense Authorization Act.
Malmstrom Air Force Base is home
to the 341st Missile Wing, which main-
tains and operates one-third of the U.S.
ICBM force. Servicemembers at
Malmstrom protect our country, but
the base can do more to keep America
safe and secure. With some work, the
base’s runway can, once again, host
flying missions.
I especially thank and recognize Mr.
TURNER from Ohio. We worked on a
measure that could reform the basing
process to focus on improving existing
facilities like Malmstrom instead of
building new ones.
This bill begins the process of includ-
ing Malmstrom in future Air Force
basing decisions to host aircraft, po-
tentially increasing the number of men
and women serving there.
I appreciate the Montana Defense Al-
liance for its advocacy on behalf of
Great Falls and all the servicemembers
at Malmstrom and elsewhere who keep
our country safe.

CONGRATULATING ROYAL OAK
CITY MANAGER DON JOHNSON
ON HIS RETIREMENT
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I rise to congratulate my constituent
and Royal Oak city manager, Don
Johnson, on his retirement after 14
years with the great city of Royal Oak.
Don started as city manager right at
the height of the Great Recession. To
hear him tell it, the city was flat
broke. Royal Oak was facing huge rev-
enue shortfalls, and Michigan families
were hurting.
In the years since, he has helped
Royal Oak turn around and become one
of the most desirable places to live and
visit. Royal Oak saw a jump of $10 mil-
lion in revenue in 10 years, truly an
outstanding accomplishment for the
people of Royal Oak and a testament to
Don’s hard work.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Don for his
years of service and wish him the very
best in his next chapter.

PROTECTING MILITARY WIDOWS
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, Congress should strive for
Democrats and Republicans in Wash-
ington to truly work together. When
the Military Surviving Spouses Equity
Act reached 365 bipartisan cosponsors,
I was grateful to share the good news.
That is a remarkable more than 80 per-
cent of Congress.
House Democrats had the ability to
bring the Military Surviving Spouses
Equity Act to the floor tomorrow to re-
peal the widow’s tax. Instead, Demo-
cratic leadership has diverted a vote by
tacking it onto a flawed and
hyperpartisan bill without notice late
at night, which they know will not re-
ceive support on both sides of the aisle.
This is heartbreaking for the 65,000
military widows in America. However,
it is not too late to do the right thing
and keep this as a standalone bipar-
tisan bill.
I encourage our colleagues across the
aisle to put H.R. 553 on the Consensus
Calendar. Together, we can give serv-
icemembers and their families the rec-
ognition they deserve.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

USE FAMILY FARMS AS
SUPPLIERS FOR ARMED FORCES
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to thank my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle for voting to include
my amendment to the NDAA that will
allow our armed services to aid small
farmers across the country.
Two weeks ago, the USDA released
its congressional district-specific data
for the ‘‘Census of Agriculture’’ and re-
ported that in my district, New York’s
19th Congressional District, 96 percent
of the farms there are small family
farms.
During our most recent in-district
work period, I visited small farms back
home in Rensselaer and Montgomery
Counties and learned more about their
work with organizations to help vet-
erans gain the skills needed to transi-
tion to jobs in agriculture.
Today, the House passed my amend-
ment that requires a report from cer-
tain Defense agencies on programs,
policies, and practices relating to
small farms, farms owned by new and
beginning farmers, veteran farmers,
and minority farmers in order to better
understand how much the Armed
Forces are working with small farms to
supply commissaries and feed service-
members.
With this data, Congress and Defense
agencies can work together to expand
opportunity for our small family farm-
ers.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues
for standing with me on this very im-
portant issue.

July 11, 2019
b 1220
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
further consideration of the bill (H.R.
2500) to authorize appropriations for
fiscal year 2020 for military activities
of the Department of Defense and for
military construction, to prescribe
military personnel strengths for such
fiscal year, and for other purposes,
with Mr. PETERS (Acting Chair) in the
chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The Acting CHAIR. When the Com-
mittee of the Whole rose on Wednes-
day, July 10, 2019, a fourth set of en
bloc amendments offered by the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH)
had been disposed of.
AMENDMENT NO. 21 OFFERED BY MR. SHERMAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 21 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle A of title XII, add
the following:
SEC. l. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO
TRANSFER DEFENSE ARTICLES AND
SERVICES TO AZERBAIJAN.
None of the funds authorized to be appro-
priated by this Act or otherwise made avail-
able to the Department of Defense for fiscal
year 2020 may be used to transfer defense ar-
ticles or services to Azerbaijan unless the
President certifies to Congress that the
transfer of such defense articles or services
does not threaten civil aviation.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from California (Mr. SHERMAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chair, one pro-
gramming note: At this point in the
schedule, we were scheduled to deal
with three SHERMAN amendments, No.
20, No. 21, and No. 22.
No. 22, also in the Rules Committee
numbering No. 83, was included in an
en bloc adopted by this House last
evening.
Amendment No. 20, Rules Committee
No. 301, is not being considered at this
time because it will be included in an
en bloc that comes up later today.
So we are now focused on No. 21,
Rules Committee No. 82, and I rise in
support of that amendment.
Mr. Chair, on September 1, 1983, Ko-
rean Air Lines 007 was shot down—269
casualties, including a Member of this
House, Congressman Larry McDonald.
On July 17, 2014, Malaysia Airlines
number 17 was shot down—298 casual-
ties.
If there is one thing this House can
agree on, it is that we are opposed to
shooting down—especially, deliberately
shooting down—civilian aircraft. And
yet the Government of Azerbaijan has
stated, with regard to flights going
into Stepanakert Airport, that they
envision the physical destruction of
airplanes landing in that territory.
This threat has been repeated several
times by Azeri officials, and in times
past, Azerbaijan has actually shot at
civil airliners going into Stepanakert
Airport. That is why this amendment
is necessary. It prohibits the transfer
of Defense Department articles to
Azerbaijan unless the President can
certify that the weapons being trans-
ferred will not threaten civilian avia-
tion.
It would be a tragedy if a civilian air-
liner were shot at or shot down as it
landed or took off from Stepanakert
Airport in the Republic of Artsakh.
But if that, God forbid, ever happens,
let it not be an American weapon.
We are on notice that antiaircraft
weapons transferred to Azerbaijan may
very well be used against civilian air-
craft. That is why it is necessary for us
to have this provision.
After 23 years of studying these
issues on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, I am not convinced that we
should transfer any weapons, under any
circumstances, to the Government of
Azerbaijan until it comes to the table
and resolves the Artsakh dispute. But,
certainly, we should not, having been
put on notice, transfer weapons that we
cannot be sure will not be used to
shoot down civilian aircraft.
I am pleased to have the cosponsor-
ship of this amendment by Representa-
tives SPEIER, SCHIFF, and PALLONE, and
I believe that this is a necessary step.
Because, as we provide weapons to
countries around the world, we should
not provide antiaircraft weapons that
we believe might very well be used to
shoot down our civilian aircraft.
I would point out that the
Stepanakert airport is located in the
Republic of Artsakh, previously known
as the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh,
a historically Armenian territory that
was lumped in with Azerbaijan by no
less than Joseph Stalin in a deliberate
effort to create ethnic tensions in the
Caucasus to the benefit of the Soviet
Union and in an effort to punish the
Armenian people.
The people of Artsakh established
their independence decades ago, and
whatever your view as to the status of
that territory, you should support this
amendment unless you believe it is ap-
propriate to shoot down civilian air-
craft.
I urge my colleagues to support the
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I stand
in opposition to the amendment offered
by Mr. SHERMAN that conditions de-
fense transfers to Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan actively contributes to
international security efforts. We see
their forces working alongside coali-
tion forces in countering terrorism in
Afghanistan, in addition to contrib-
uting a logistics supply route vital to
U.S. and coalition forces.
Azerbaijan lies in a compromising
position between two hostile forces:
Russia and Iran. Our bilateral relation-
ship and the incredible amount of sup-
port the Azeris have provided to U.S.
missions in Afghanistan were strong
indicators of how our partnership has
grown since Azerbaijan first gained its
independence in 1991. We must not
limit our ability to provide reciprocal
support to our friend and partner in a
tumultuous region.
Putin’s history of utilizing military
force against its neighbors, such as
Ukraine and Georgia, forebodes his
willingness to use the same methods
against others that counter him.
The United States Department of
State is responsible for the review of
sales and transfers of defense articles
and services. They exercise this respon-
sibility through an interagency process
that assesses each possible arms trans-
fer on a case-by-case basis. Mr. SHER-
MAN’s amendment unnecessarily sin-
gles out Azerbaijan by placing an addi-
tional certification requirement on the
State Department’s armed sales review
process.
The length of time this amendment
would add to the defense exports re-
view process is detrimental in the
event of an attack by militarily supe-
rior Russia against our security part-
ner, Azerbaijan, while providing no
added benefit to our bilateral relation-
ship. This would include a lengthening
of time in reviewing arms sales in-
tended for Azeri forces operating in
counterterrorism operations in Afghan-
istan.
Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-
occupied territory inside the borders of
Azerbaijan, which has undergone bitter
conflict for two decades.
The OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired
by the United States, has sought a
peaceful solution to the conflict since
1992. By conditioning sales to Azer-
baijan, the United States Congress
would tilt the United States neutral
position as a member of the Minsk
Group and hinder resolution efforts in
Nagorno-Karabakh. By taking sides,
the trust that has been built up by the
U.S. and Azerbaijan through the
group’s efforts would be gravely dimin-
ished, and the conflict would degen-
erate further.
b 1230
The NDAA is not the appropriate ve-
hicle for taking sides on a political
issue, nor should it be used to influence
a process that clearly lies within the
jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs
Committee.
This amendment is not required. The
Department of Defense already adheres
to the provisions of the Department of
State’s March 2019 extension of section
907, which specifies that assistance to
Azerbaijan will not be used for offen-
sive purposes against Armenia.

AMENDMENT NO. 23 OFFERED BY MR. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 23 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chairman, I rise to offer amendment
No. 23 as the designee of Representa-
tive GABBARD.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle G of title XII, add
the following new section:
SEC. 1268. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FROM
THE SPECIAL DEFENSE ACQUISI-
TION FUND.
Section 114(c) of title 10, United States
Code, is amended by adding at the end the
following new paragraph:
‘‘(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), none
of the funds made available from the Special
Defense Acquisition Fund for any fiscal year
may be made available to provide any assist-
ance to Saudi Arabia or the United Arab
Emirates if such assistance could be used by
either country to conduct or continue hos-
tilities in Yemen.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from California (Mr. TED LIEU) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, I rise to speak in support of the
amendment offered by Representative
GABBARD of Hawaii on the limitation
on the use of funds from the Special
Defense Acquisition Fund for Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
This fund allows the U.S. military to
preorder weapons for sale to foreign
militaries and is intended to reduce
wait times for weapons or related serv-
ices.
While this is normally a good way to
prevent a long and detrimental wait for
our allies to use weapons in self-de-
fense, is it unconscionable that it be
used to kill and wound civilians in an
unjust war.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have,
since 2015, been bombing schools, hos-
pitals, buses, and other civilian tar-
gets.
As of March of this year, nearly 18,000
people have been killed or injured by
this bombing campaign since hos-
tilities began in 2015, according to the
U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights.
Thousands more have been displaced
by the fighting, and millions are faced
with starvation, hunger, and disease.
This has created a humanitarian cri-
sis, destroyed water supplies, and cre-
ated shortages in food and medical
care.
We have already passed a resolution
seeking to end U.S. involvement in this
slaughter, only to have the President
veto it, while he continues to supply
Saudi Arabia with U.S. missiles and
bombs.
This amendment will prevent the
military from speeding supplies to
Saudi Arabia and the UAE and will do
much to alleviate the suffering of the
people of Yemen.
Mr. Chair, I ask that all Members
support this amendment and end our
involvement in this shameful war, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I oppose this
amendment prohibiting the use of
funds from the Special Defense Acqui-
sition Fund to provide assistance to
Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emir-
ates if such assistance could be used in
hostilities in Yemen.
Nearly every Member in this Cham-
ber has made it very clear that we are
concerned about civilian casualties re-
sulting from the conflict in Yemen.
However, this amendment does not ad-
dress that concern.
The war in Yemen must end, but, as
Iran continues to finance terror and
help the Houthis, who have overthrown
the government, the consequence will
be utter devastation for the Yemeni ci-
vilians.
Our assistance for the coalition op-
posing Houthi and Iranian terror in
Yemen started in 2015 during the
Obama administration when the
Houthis overthrew a legitimate govern-
ment, with Iran’s assistance.
The Houthis fired missiles against
the coalition, with support from Iran,
and the U.S. provided intelligence and
logistical support in compliance with
the Law of Armed Conflict.
Iran poses a massive geostrategic
threat in the area around Yemen,
throughout the Middle East, and to the
United States and many of our allies.
Right now, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, Yemen, and the U.S.
share a common adversary in Iran.
We cannot signal to Iran that their
continued aggression will be tolerated.
Iran’s nefarious activities must be
countered effectively.
The coalition continues to face an
onslaught of Houthi attacks on civilian
targets, and the U.S. needs a nuanced
approach that helps our Nation, our
partners, and avoids civilian casual-
ties.
Instead, this amendment slams the
door shut, crushing any opportunity to
see the region and civilians protected.
Have no doubt: The coalition will
continue to purchase arms, including
defensive weapons, from other sources
that have no regard for how these
weapons are deployed.
As a result of this amendment, the
war in Yemen will not end, nor will it
assist the United States or our stra-
tegic allies in containing Iran’s malign
influence in the region.
Mr. Chair, I urge Members to oppose
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, again, I urge
my colleagues to oppose this amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of
my time.

The question was taken; and the Act-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5597
July 11, 2019
Saudi Arabia and the UAE are still
America’s allies. But what I object to
and what many of us in Congress object
to is the bypassing of Congress in sell-
ing arms to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
On May 24, the Trump administra-
tion, through Secretary Pompeo, noti-
fied Congress that it was declaring a
fake emergency to bypass congres-
sional review of 22 arms sales to Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
How do we know this was a fake
emergency? Because there is no emer-
gency to the United States or to UAE
or to Saudi Arabia regarding the war in
Yemen.
It is a horrific humanitarian prob-
lem. The Saudi-led coalition has killed
countless civilians. But it is not an
emergency that would justify weapons
sales to Saudi Arabia and UAE that by-
passes congressional procedure.
And, in fact, it has been recently re-
ported that the UAE is now pulling its
troops out of Yemen. What kind of
emergency is this that would require
the bypass of Congress to sell arms to
UAE and Saudi Arabia?
In addition, we had a hearing in the
Foreign Affairs Committee where the
Trump administration official admit-
ted that many of these arms would not
even be ready for months, if not years,
in order to be sold.
So, it is unacceptable that the ad-
ministration is trying to bypass Con-
gress.
What this amendment will do is sim-
ply say you cannot declare a fake
emergency to bypass Congress to sell
these arms. If you want to sell these
arms to Saudi Arabia and UAE, you
have to do it through the normal proc-
ess.
Mr. Chair, I request an ‘‘aye’’ vote on
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to this amendment, which
would prohibit any funds from being
used to process any arms sales or
transfers to Saudi Arabia or the United
Arab Emirates pursuant to emergency
certification made under the Arms Ex-
port Control Act.
The President’s emergency certifi-
cation of May 24 to move 22 arms sales
as an emergency was to address in-
creased threats from Iran to U.S. secu-
rity interests and Iran’s continued ef-
forts to destabilize the region, which
directly impacts our strategic allies.
The Democrat majority had been
holding onto arms sales through con-
gressional notification requirements
and abusing oversight power with the
Arms Export Control Act. Some of
these requests by the administration
had been on hold for over a year, and
there was no progress in determining
why.
We witnessed just last month, on
June 19, Iran shot down a U.S. military
asset, a drone over international
waters, one of many examples of Ira-
nian aggression toward the United
States and other nations, many in that
region surrounding Iran.
There is no doubt that Iran is an in-
creased threat.
Mr. Chair, I urge Members to oppose
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
CICILLINE).
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding and rise in
strong support of the Lieu amendment.
I am proud to be a cosponsor of this
amendment, which will prevent the
sale of weapons to the Gulf without un-
dergoing the proper congressional noti-
fication process.
This administration invented an
emergency in the Middle East in order
to circumvent the process of congres-
sional review over arms sales, an egre-
gious and legally questionable move, to
put more weapons in the hands of re-
gimes who are responsible for perpe-
trating horrific civilian casualties in
Yemen, often with U.S. weapons.
The administration briefed this body
on Iran just days before the supposed
emergency was declared, yet never
mentioned anything at the time about
an emergency.
The administration claims that Iran
poses such an imminent threat to our
allies that emergency assistance is
needed for Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates to defend themselves,
yet most of these weapons are offensive
weapons and much of the sale will be
delivered months or years from now.
The logic doesn’t make sense because
there is no logic. This is an administra-
tion that has cozied up to Riyadh,
sweeping aside gross human rights
abuses, turning a blind eye to the
Saudis taking a buzz saw to a Wash-
ington Post reporter, and supporting
an intervention in Yemen that is caus-
ing famine, destruction, and mounting
loss of life.
Just because you don’t like the proc-
ess doesn’t mean you get to ignore it.
This action has implications far be-
yond this current sale, and if Congress
doesn’t reassert our proper role in the
process, we risk giving up our author-
ity in the arms sale process entirely.
Mr. Chair, I strongly encourage my
colleagues to support this excellent
amendment.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I just want
to point out Chairman ENGEL has been
approaching this issue in a little more
of a surgical approach in looking at
Federal law. I think that that would be
the more appropriate tactic in being
able to work together in a bipartisan
fashion on this issue.
This amendment, with all due respect
to my good friend from California, is a
little more of a sledgehammer. I think
he would probably say that that would
be true, unapologetically.
I, though, would certainly encourage
my colleagues, really, on both sides of
the aisle, to be able to work together
through concerns that others may have
rather than passing this particular
amendment.
There has been a hold that has been
placed for a very long time. And I
would encourage any Members of Con-
gress who are responsible for that hold
or support the hold to articulate to us
and to the administration exactly what
the hold is, what the concerns are, and
how we can work through it together.
I hope that we all are in unanimity
with concern over Iranian aggression
in the Middle East. We are all in una-
nimity with concern when we see
Iran—beyond the rhetorical calling us
the great Satan—pledging death to
America, building a land bridge across
the Middle East, supporting Assad in
Syria and financing Hezbollah in Leb-
anon.
And, certainly, there are the con-
cerns with the movement in shipping
lanes around Yemen, a conflict that
the Houthis, in overthrowing a legiti-
mate government, did with the backing
of the Iranians.
So, there are a lot of concerns that
we have on our side of the aisle as it re-
lates to Iranian aggression, and I hope
that we can work together in dealing
with those concerns that we all have as
it relates to Iranian aggression.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, I agree Iran is a malign influ-
ence in the Middle East, but that
doesn’t mean the administration gets
to bypass Congress in selling arms to
Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Washington (Mr.
SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I respect the gentleman’s point about
how we need to work towards an agree-
ment to how Congress can have the
most constructive role possible on
arms sales.
The concern here is the tendency of
the White House to declare an emer-
gency when they simply want to do
something that we haven’t allowed
them to do. It is troubling because it
takes us out of the process, so we need
to find a way to make sure that they
can’t do that.
It is not a huge mystery why these
arms sales have been held up. We are
concerned about Iran’s malign influ-
ence. We are also concerned about the
actions that Saudi Arabia has been
taking in that region that could be
stirring up conflict and making it easi-
er for Iran to have that malign influ-
ence; quite specifically, killing civil-
ians in Yemen in a way that generates
sympathy, certainly, for the Houthis in
Yemen but then sympathy for that
side.
So, we are worried about the way
Saudi Arabia is conducting this war,
certainly, and we are also worried
about other actions by Saudi Arabia.
Certainly, the murder of the journalist,
Jamal Khashoggi, has not been an-
swered for to this point.

So, simply selling weapons to Saudi
Arabia at this point is something that
is going to take time and is going to
raise questions.
For the President to simply bypass
us, taking us out of the process in that
situation, I think, undermines our role.
That is the purpose of this amend-
ment, and I urge adoption.

Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I also think
it is important to note that the United
States has not engaged in direct hos-
tilities in Yemen. We stopped the re-
fueling of Saudi aircraft, so the activi-
ties have actually, in many respects,
been walked back from what was his-
torically known as being directly en-
gaged in hostilities on the ground,
which is just not the case here as it re-
lates to the United States.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, this issue has bipartisan sup-
port, and I request an ‘‘aye’’ vote on

I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, again, I

pose this amendment.

AMENDMENT NO. 26 OFFERED BY MR. SMITH OF
WASHINGTON
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 26 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I rise to offer amendment
No. 26 as the designee of Mr. KHANNA.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the appropriate place in subtitle G of
title XII, insert the following:
SEC. 12ll. PROHIBITION ON SUPPORT FOR MILI-
TARY PARTICIPATION AGAINST THE
HOUTHIS.
(a) PROHIBITION RELATING TO SUPPORT.—
None of the funds authorized to be appro-
priated or otherwise made available by this
Act may be made available to provide the
following forms of United States support to
Saudi-led coalition’s operations against the
Houthis in Yemen:
(1) Sharing intelligence for the purpose of
enabling coalition strikes.
(2) Providing logistical support for coali-
tion strikes, including by providing mainte-
nance or transferring spare parts to coalition
members flying warplanes engaged in anti-
Houthi bombings.
(b) PROHIBITION RELATING TO MILITARY
PARTICIPATION.—None of the funds author-
ized to be appropriated or otherwise made
available by this Act may be made available
for any civilian or military personnel of the
Department of Defense to command, coordi-
nate, participate in the movement of, or ac-
company the regular or irregular military
forces of the Saudi and United Arab Emir-
ates-led coalition forces in hostilities
against the Houthis in Yemen or in situa-
tions in which there exists an imminent
threat that such coalition forces become en-
gaged in such hostilities, unless and until
the President has obtained specific statutory
authorization, in accordance with section
8(a) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C.
1547(a)).
(c) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—The prohibi-
tions under this section may not be con-
strued to apply with respect to United States
Armed Forces engaged in operations directed
at al Qaeda or associated forces.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. SMITH) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, this amendment is a vari-
ation on a bill that this House passed
and the Senate passed as well that the
President vetoed that would cut off
any U.S. support for the Saudi coali-
tion that is fighting in Yemen.
And I will agree with some discussion
that came earlier that this is a com-
plicated situation because we are con-
cerned about the malign influence of
Iran in the region. But the problem is
the way the war has been conducted in
Yemen.
As I mentioned earlier on the pre-
vious amendment, the civilian casual-
ties and the way the war has been con-
ducted has undermined, I believe, our
efforts to arrive at a peaceful solution
and to begin to limit the Iranian influ-
ence in the region.
I met with Saudi Arabian officials as
they explained to me what their tar-
geting strategy was, and how they were
trying to mitigate civilian casualties,
but I was not impressed because what-
ever they showed me on these pieces of
paper, it has been well-documented
that they bombed a school bus, killing
a large number of children. They actu-
ally bombed a funeral, a funeral that
had a lot of the key leaders in Yemen
at it that were going to be responsible
for negotiating a peace agreement. And
on countless other instances they have
bombed civilian targets.
There is also a very aggressive block-
ade going on in Yemen that is having a
devastating humanitarian impact.
Now, I understand that Iran is also
doing things that we should oppose.
They are killing civilians; they are
stirring up difficulties. But we are not
supporting Iran. We are not responsible
for that piece of it.
But to the extent that we participate
in helping Saudi Arabia, through intel-
ligence sharing, through refueling,
through a variety of different means,
we are participating in the atrocities
that are being committed on that side,
and we should not be. It is not what is
going to lead us to a peaceful solution.
I also want to emphasize that this
amendment, as did the bill that we
passed, very carefully carves out the
activity that we are engaged in in
Yemen to counter violent extremist
groups like al-Qaida and ISIS that have
arisen in the region.
We have a counterterrorism presence
in Yemen. This amendment in no way
restricts us from continuing that coun-
terterrorism activity. This is focused
on the civil war in Yemen.
And it is worth noting that, as we get
to the point now where Iran is in-
volved, that is not the way it started.
Basically, the Houthis in Yemen were
an oppressed minority and suffered dec-
ades of mistreatment at the hands of
whoever happened to be in charge in
Yemen, which led to the revolt.
Now, since that time, the Houthis
have committed all manner of atroc-
ities, as well as the war moved forward.
But initially, this was a civil war that
doesn’t really have anything to do with
the terrorism fight that we are doing.
And I think it is incredibly important
for the credibility of our foreign policy
to clearly differentiate between our ac-
tivities, our legitimate activities, in
Yemen to stop those terrorists in
Yemen who threaten us and threaten
our allies in the region, and the activi-
ties of this broader civil war that, as I
said, I believe, is merely creating more
violence in the Middle East and em-
powering Iran by creating widespread
sympathy across the board and in the
United States for the Houthis and for
the people in Yemen who are being the
victims of these bombing attacks.
The U.S. should step back from this.
And if Saudi Arabia is the great ally
that everyone has said they are, we
should be able to have a conversation
with them about how they change their
actions, so we can be in a better posi-
tion to support them and lead toward
greater peace in the region and contain
Iran. That is what we need to do.
But the current policy isn’t working,
so this amendment makes it clear the
United States is not supporting the
Saudi-led coalition that is engaged in
the civil war in Yemen, and I urge sup-
port.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I completely
support Congress’ solemn duty under
Article I of the Constitution to author-
ize the commitment of U.S. troops to
foreign hostilities; but that is not the
only issue here.
This amendment attempts to block
intelligence sharing to our strategic
partners such as Saudi Arabia at a
time when those partners have civilian
targets that are actively being at-
tacked by Iran-backed Houthi rebels.
Intelligence sharing can help our
partners protect their forces and their
civilians. It can also help them ensure
that they are hitting their correct tar-
gets, thereby minimizing civilian cas-
ualties.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5599
July 11, 2019
Additionally, the Iran-backed
Houthis are stepping up its attacks on
U.S. assets in Yemen. CENTCOM con-
firmed that the Houthis shot down a
U.S. drone earlier this summer. If we
cut off intelligence sharing with our
strategic partners, it will certainly
have repercussions that diminish our
abilities to protect our own assets.
There is reason that a bipartisan ma-
jority supported exempting intel-
ligence sharing from the War Powers
Resolution on Yemen that we consid-
ered earlier this year. It is because this
type of cooperation is essential to U.S.
interests in the region, including en-
suring responsible conduct of the war
in Yemen.
It is important to point out that
here, in this case with Yemen, the
Houthis overthrew a government with
the backing of Iran. Iran is the world’s
largest state sponsor of terror. They do
many malign, nonnuclear, nefarious
activities.
While, for good reason, we give the
most amount of attention to Iran’s nu-
clear activities—they call Israel the
Little Satan, the United States the
Great Satan, and they pledge death to
America in their parliament and on
their streets and in their holidays—
they have been attempting to build a
land bridge to the west of the country.
They have a much more growing in-
fluence within the government of Iraq.
They have been propping up Assad in
Syria. They have been financing rock-
ets and other activities to support
Hezbollah in Lebanon.
When you look towards the Strait of
Bab al-Mandab, and the area around
Yemen, and the strategic advantage for
Iran to be able to successfully help the
Houthis in overthrowing this govern-
ment and having long-term security,
Iranian aggression has caused a re-
alignment of different alliances within
the Middle East.
Many of these nations are looking at
Israel differently than they used to be-
cause they are so concerned with Ira-
nian aggression.
I think what is most important for
U.S. interests in the Middle East and,
specifically, in Yemen, one, it is criti-
cally important, and as the gentleman
said in his point, minimizing civilian
casualties must be of a bipartisan con-
cern. It should be one of international
concern, most importantly, for inno-
cent civilians who end up losing their
life.
Additionally, those who are cutting
off access to humanitarian aid is also
of great concern and great debate.
So for myself, speaking for myself
specifically, as it relates to Yemen, I
am greatly concerned by the Houthis
activities backed by Iran, and it is one
that we should successfully be hoping
that that aggression is pushed back to
the point that Houthis are unsuccess-
ful; that Iran is unsuccessful, and they
are pushed back to their own country,
back in a defensive posture, and we
don’t see further aggression in more
countries.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I have no further speakers and I am
prepared to close.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. CRAWFORD).
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to this amendment. As a
veteran, and as a member of the House
Intelligence Committee, I have had the
privilege of seeing firsthand how intel-
ligence supports U.S. foreign policy
abroad and just how important our al-
lies are when fighting our adversaries.
Intelligence sharing relationships act
as a force multiplier, ensuring the se-
curity of the United States and our al-
lies. As we have seen time and time
again, restricting such critical infor-
mation sharing results in disastrous re-
percussions.
Even as we debate this amendment,
our strategic partners, such as Saudi
Arabia, have civilian targets that are
being attacked by Iran-backed Houthi
rebels. These same Iran-supported
rebels pose a threat to U.S. military
personnel in the region.
Yesterday, this body debated an
amendment tasking the ODNI to pro-
vide an annual report on civilian cas-
ualties.
You know what helps minimize civil-
ian casualties? Intelligence. Intel-
ligence helps ensure that the correct
targets are hit, while minimizing col-
lateral damage.
I am gravely concerned with the dan-
gerous long-term implications of this
ill-advised amendment. For this rea-
son, I urge my colleagues to oppose the
amendment.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I am prepared to close. I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, who has the
right to close?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Washington has the right to
close.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
I would just encourage all my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment for
reasons that were stated, hopefully,
with great concern across this entire
body on both sides of the aisle as it re-
lates to Iranian aggression.
We need to work together, really all
around the world or wherever the
United States can be of assistance to
minimize civilian casualties, to get ac-
cess to humanitarian aid.
There is debate at times of who is re-
sponsible, but I think it is important
for us to do a better job working to-
gether to achieve the results that are
in the best interests of the United
States, even though we have debates at
times of the best way to get there.
I encourage all Members to vote
‘‘no.’’
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
I think the intelligence sharing point
the gentleman from Arkansas made is
very important. Let me say, there are
multiple countries involved in this coa-
lition in Yemen.
In working with the UAE, for in-
stance, they actually do take steps to
minimize civilian casualties and are
reasonably successful about it in the
operations that they have conducted,
both from the air and the ground.
Saudi Arabia has not. And believe
me, I certainly understood the malign
influence of Iran and their relationship
with the Houthis. But Saudi Arabia,
time and time again, regrettably, has
not used this intelligence sharing in a
way that minimizes civilian casualties.
I had cited the instances earlier of
the school bus that was bombed; the fu-
neral party that was bombed; the civil-
ians who are continually hit. They are
not using this intelligence sharing in a
way to minimize civilian casualties.
And I think we need to make a state-
ment that they are going to have to
change their ways before we continue
to do this.
On the broader issue, and that is
really what Yemen is about for U.S.
policy purposes, is Iran’s influence in
the region and, also, the role that
Saudi Arabia plays in the violence. And
the problem I have with the adminis-
tration’s policy right now is it would
do nothing to contain what Saudi Ara-
bia is doing, which only exacerbates
the violence and creates openings for
Iran. So we need to balance that.
As far Iran is concerned, right now it
is hard to say where the administra-
tion’s policy is going. It is a maximum
pressure campaign. We have seen Iran
lash out since we abandoned the nu-
clear deal. They are now moving more
in the direction of developing a nuclear
weapon than they were before we aban-
doned the nuclear deal.
The administration is now saying
that they want to force Iran to the
table to stop them from getting a nu-
clear weapon.
We need a better policy in Iran. I
urge support for the amendment.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

The question was taken; and the Act-

At the appropriate place in subtitle G of
title XII, insert the following:
SEC. 12ll. REPEAL OF PROHIBITION ON TRANS-
FER OF ARTICLES ON THE UNITED
STATES MUNITIONS LIST TO CY-
PRUS.
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the direct sale or transfer of arms by
the United States to Cyprus would advance
United States security interests in Europe
by helping to reduce the dependence of the
Government of Cyprus on other countries for
defense-related materiel, including countries
that pose challenges to United States inter-
ests around the world; and
(2) it is in the interest of the United
States—
(A) to continue to support United Nations-
facilitated efforts toward a comprehensive
solution to the division of Cyprus; and
(B) for the Republic of Cyprus to join
NATO’s Partnership for Peace program.
(b) MODIFICATION OF PROHIBITION.—Section
620C(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961
(22 U.S.C. 2373(e)) is amended by adding at
the end of the following new paragraph:
‘‘(3) The requirement under paragraph (1)
shall not apply to any sale or other provision
of any defense article or defense service to
Cyprus if the end-user of such defense or de-
fense service is Cyprus.’’.
(c) EXCLUSION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS FROM CERTAIN RELATED
REGULATIONS.—Beginning on the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of
State shall not apply a policy of denial for
exports, re-exports, or transfers of defense
articles and defense services destined for or
originating in the Republic of Cyprus if—
(1) the request is made by or on behalf of
Cyprus; and
(2) the end-user of such defense articles or
defense services is Cyprus.
(d) EXCEPTION.—This exclusion shall not
apply to any denial based upon credible
human rights concerns.
(e) LIMITATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF ARTI-
CLES ON THE UNITED STATES MUNITIONS LIST
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The policy of denial for
exports, re-exports, or transfers of defense
articles on the United States Munitions List
to the Republic of Cyprus shall remain in
place unless the President determines and
certifies to the appropriate congressional
committees not less than annually that—
(A) the Government of the Republic of Cy-
prus is continuing to cooperate with the
United States Government in efforts to im-
plement reforms on anti-money laundering
regulations and financial regulatory over-
sight; and
(B) the Government of the Republic of Cy-
prus has made and is continuing to take the
steps necessary to deny Russian military
vessels access to ports for refueling and serv-
icing.
(2) WAIVER.—The President may waive the
limitations contained in this subsection for
one fiscal year if the President determines
that it is essential to the national security
interests of the United States to do so.
(3) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES DEFINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘ap-
propriate congressional committees’’
means—
(A) the Committee on Foreign Relations
and the Committee on Armed Services of the
Senate; and
(B) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and
the Committee on Armed Services of the
House of Representatives.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Rhode Island.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, the
Republic of Cyprus is a strategic part-
ner of the United States and has played
a critical role in combating terrorism
and nuclear proliferation in the East-
ern Mediterranean region. The United
States regularly participates in joint
exercises with Cyprus, including an-
nual multinational search and rescue
and crisis management exercises, and
we coordinate training programs for
Cyprus in explosives management and
disposal, cybersecurity, counterterror-
ism, and maritime safety and security.
Through information sharing, train-
ing programs, and other international
and regional security initiatives, the
United States and Cyprus work hand in
hand to combat terrorist activity in
Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean
region. The United States also works
closely with Cyprus to stop the spread
of weapons of mass destruction, and
Cyprus has helped foster an effective
international nonproliferation regime.
In 2015, the U.S. joined Cyprus, as
members of the Proliferation Security
Initiative, in cohosting a regional non-
proliferation workshop focusing on in-
specting and identifying proliferation
material.
Yet despite the critical security part-
nership between our two countries, the
United States has had an arms embar-
go in place against Cyprus since 1987.
This policy was initially intended to
prevent Turkey from using American
weapons to occupy Cyprus and to pro-
vide space for reunification talks after
Turkey’s 1974 invasion of Cyprus and
its subsequent occupation of the north-
ern territory.
However, more than 3 years since the
embargo was first implemented, Tur-
key still has more than 30,000 troops
occupying the northern territory of Cy-
prus, reunification talks have not pro-
duced intended results, and the U.S. is
unable to maintain a full security rela-
tionship with a key partner in com-
bating terrorism.
Even today, Turkey continues to use
its U.S.-backed military might to
threaten Cyprus’ energy exploration by
continually harassing drilling vessels
in its exclusive economic zone. And
Turkey is not merely threatening the
Republic of Cyprus, but significant
American investments by ExxonMobil
and Noble Energy and the interests of
key U.S. allies in Greece, Egypt, and
Israel, all of whom are partners with
Cyprus on energy developments.
The outdated and ineffective arms
embargo forces Cyprus, an EU member,
and one of only three countries with a
status of forces agreement with Israel,
to obtain defense articles from coun-
tries like Russia that seek to under-
mine U.S. interests in the region.
We need to enact policies that
strengthen our relationship with Cy-
prus and counteract dangerous ele-
ments in the region which threaten our
national security interests and the in-
terests of our allies and partners in the
Eastern Mediterranean.
Our inability to provide Cyprus with
necessary equipment needed to defend
its sovereignty and its economic inter-
ests threatens our own national secu-
rity.
Lifting the arms embargo will allow
Cyprus to better establish itself as a
frontline state for Western security in-
terests, defend itself from external
threats, and will ensure that Cyprus is
no longer forced to seek assistance for
its defense from countries like Russia.
It will also make regional security co-
operation smoother for the United
States by making sure our partners
can obtain compatible defense systems
and training from the U.S. military.
My bipartisan amendment would re-
peal the ineffective embargo and en-
sure that Cyprus has the equipment
necessary to continue to help the U.S.
combat terrorism and international
crime, and protect significant natural
gas finds and the infrastructure that
can bring this energy source to Europe.
The Senate has already taken up this
issue and passed language to repeal the
embargo with bipartisan support dur-
ing its consideration of the NDAA. The
House should follow suit and support
passage of my bipartisan amendment.
Mr. Chairman, Cyprus is a vital and
strategic international partner, and we
need to make sure we are treating it as
such. I urge adoption of the amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I appreciate the comments of the
gentleman from Rhode Island, and I
want to agree in substantial measure
with what he said about the progress
that Cyprus has made both in coun-
tering Russian influence and in com-
bating international money laundering
and other issues on which we have been
working with them. I do believe that,
as the gentleman indicated, the embar-
go that has been in place since 1987
ought to be considered and looked at,
and there ought to at least be consid-
ered a plan to gradually move away
from that embargo if and as Cyprus
continues to make progress in weaning
itself off Russian weapons and the
other priorities that we have with
them.
What I worry about is, all of a sud-
den, in a total of a 10-minute debate on
the National Defense Authorization
Act, that we come in and say, ‘‘Okay,
the embargo is gone; what has been in
place since 1987, never mind anymore,’’
without really thinking through the
consequences and having that plan
that helps us work with Cyprus to get
to a better place.
And I don’t need to remind Members
that this area is very complex, with a

number of actors that have intense in-
terest in what happens in Cyprus and
in the region. I am not saying that we
don’t move in that direction, but I am
saying, to come here with a 10-minute
debate and say, ‘‘Okay, never mind
what we have done since 1987’’ is
fraught with danger.
So, for that reason, I must oppose
this amendment. I appreciate the
progress that is being made. I think it
is important to look for ways to build
on that progress, but for us to come in
and say, ‘‘Oh, never mind; we are going
to upend something that has been in
place for so many years’’ would be dan-
gerous.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for his thoughts.
I would only say that the best way to
assist Cyprus in weaning itself from
the reliance of Russian weaponry is to
lift the arms embargo, and this is
something that both Cyprus and the
United States have studied for a very
long time. The best way to strengthen
this partnership and alliance is to re-
peal this embargo.
I would also like to take this oppor-
tunity to thank my colleague, Con-
gressman GUS BILIRAKIS, for cospon-
soring this amendment and for his
leadership on this issue.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chair, I rise today in
strong support of the amendment put forward
by my good friend, Representative CICILLINE,
to lift the antiquated and failed prohibition on
defense article and service transfers to our
Eastern Mediterranean ally—the Republic of
Cyprus.
In 1987, the U.S. Department of State
placed the Republic of Cyprus on a list of
countries to which sales and transfers of de-
fense articles and services is prohibited under
the International Trade in Arms Regulations.
The reason for the prohibition has never been
clear. However, it appears to have been im-
posed in the erroneous belief that it would
somehow encourage Greek Cypriots and
Turkish Cypriots to resolve the nearly 45–year
division of the territory of Cyprus.
Unfortunately, no progress toward a peace-
ful and just settlement has occurred since the
prohibition was imposed in 1987. The lack of
progress is due to Turkish stubbornness most
recently demonstrated by Turkey’s insistence
on antiquated and obstructive stances, such
as the Treaty of Guarantee, which would allow
for future unilateral Turkish military interven-
tions and is completely unacceptable and con-
tradicts the governing principals of a European
Union member state.
It is time to lift the arms prohibition on the
Republic of Cyprus. It is in the best interests
of the United States for the Republic of Cy-
prus to look to the United States, and not any
other nation, to procure its defense articles.
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
CICILLINE).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Rhode Island will
be postponed.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from New York (Mr. ENGEL) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I always
view military policy as a measure of
last resort in our foreign policy. When
the American military is engaged any-
where in the world, it often comes at
the cost of American lives and the lives
of innocent civilians. These are the
most tragic costs of war, one reason
why we can never, ever be reckless in
the use of military force.
Civilian casualties are a tragedy.
They also give extremist groups fodder
to radicalize and recruit new fighters.
We need to do everything in our power
to reduce the number of civilian cas-
ualties. The Pentagon has made
progress in this area thanks in part to
new requirements Congress put in
place. My amendment would build on
this progress in a number of ways.
First of all, it would help fill in the
blanks when it comes to our own plan-
ning and reporting about civilian cas-
ualties. Right now, there tends to be a
big difference between what the De-
fense Department estimates in terms of
civilian casualties before a military
strike and what the Department re-
ports after and, again, a big difference
between our official reporting and what
NGOs report. My amendment would re-
quire a new analysis of these dispari-
ties to help figure out why we are get-
ting it wrong ahead of time and why
there is such a wide range of reporting
after the fact.
Secondly, while the Pentagon has
done good work developing sound poli-
cies in this area, more must be done on
implementation. My measure would
improve consistent standards across all
the combatant commands.
Thirdly, this amendment will help
improve the way we gather informa-
tion about civilian casualties. It will
establish new criteria and methods to
assess allegations of casualties, and it
will make sure we work more effec-
tively with local populations.
Lastly, we need to understand that
the Defense Department needs to keep
learning and adapting. My amendment
would require standards for incor-
porating lessons learned so our policies
and practices will continue to improve
as time goes on.
Because this is a learning process, I
will say that this amendment won’t
give us a perfect policy. We need to
keep working toward more comprehen-
sive, responsible ways of preventing
and addressing civilian casualties. We
need to keep giving the Defense De-
partment the tools it needs to do so.
This measure will provide a few more
of those tools, and I am glad the House
is able to consider it today.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Let me start off by being very clear
on this issue: Our military forces aim
for zero civilian casualties—zero—and
one civilian casualty during a military
operation is one too many. No one un-
derstands this better than our men and
women in uniform who go through ex-
treme efforts to continually avoid ci-
vilian casualties, and no committee
understands this better than the House
Armed Services Committee.
So this amendment that we are dis-
cussing now is one of several that we
have seen this year that unnecessarily
expand and increase reporting on civil-
ian casualties and allegations of civil-
ian casualties caused by our men and
women in uniform.
I am disappointed that, once again,
the majority chose to give up Defense
Committee jurisdiction to another out-
side committee. So this amendment
would, in effect, give an outside com-
mittee additional reporting on what
amounts to ongoing and current mili-
tary operations.
To date, this has been the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Defense Commit-
tee’s. In fact, the civilian casualty
frameworks that we are discussing
today were put in place in previous
NDAAs under the previous Republican
majority on a bipartisan basis. We
tried to work in additional edits to this
amendment, given the importance of
this issue, but those edits were refused
by the majority, which is why we are
debating this today.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. BACON).
Mr. BACON. Mr. Chairman, I appre-
ciate the opportunity to speak on this.
After serving 30 years in the Air
Force and serving with multiple air op-
eration centers, I know how hard our
military works to get this right. Our
military forces go through extreme
measures to avoid civilian casualties.
At any given time, combatant com-
manders have multiple boards, centers,
cells, and working groups that are fo-
cused on reducing civilian casualties,
in addition to the work of the various
target development working groups.
Additionally, there are significant
and recurring legal reviews conducted
as proposed targets are evaluated for
compliance with the law of war by
judge advocates, legal advisers, and
target engagement authorities—and
this is before any strike is even taken.
To evaluate civilian casualties and
allegations, military commanders look
at and consider reports from all
sources, including NGOs, credible
media sources and outlets, and even so-
cial media.
In addition to evaluating all these
various reports, they look at the video
surveillance that they have and other
forms of data from their ISR assets,
witness observations; they take human
intelligence and other forms of intel-
ligence.
Of course, there are going to be dif-
ferences in initial reporting—and
sometimes even months afterwards—
between what DOD sees and what other
groups are seeing, but this is war, and
war is chaos. And our adversaries fre-
quently also inflate civilian losses to
further their aims.
So my position is this. We have a
great process in place. It is working.
The military has given it their very
best to get this right. The integrity of
our military commanders is such that
we can trust their effort with what
they are doing now, and any discrep-
ancies, they are acknowledged and
they are investigated, and they try to
get it as right as they can.
To say our military does not take
these allegations of civilian casualties
seriously means you don’t understand
the policy, the process, and the level of
effort that goes into avoiding these
casualties in the first place. And inves-
tigating any allegations of civilian
causalities in any post operation, they
do their very best to get this right.
Our military is working hard. They
are trying to achieve our objectives. I
stand in objection to the amendment.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, let me
say that I would respectfully remind
my colleagues that the Foreign Affairs
Committee has jurisdiction over au-
thorizations for the use of military
force, and military strikes are con-
ducted under authority from the For-
eign Affairs Committee. It shares juris-
diction.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5603
July 11, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, this isn’t
an easy subject to deal with, but it
cannot be swept under the rug. It is
good that the Pentagon has taken
steps in recent years to adopt stronger
and more responsible policies when it
comes to civilian casualties.
b 1315
We need to keep pressing forward on
this work to make sure we have the
best information, to make sure this is
a problem taken seriously and being
dealt with, and to make sure the
United States is behaving responsibly
when these tragedies do occur.
Mr. Chair, I ask for Members to sup-
port this measure, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, in clos-
ing, again, I think it is important to
note that as a matter of practice on
the ground, we want zero civilian cas-
ualties, not only for law of war and
ethical reasons but because our troops
are often there to work alongside and
protect civilian populations, so any un-
necessary force creates additional en-
emies. One civilian casualty is one too
many.
But this amendment is unnecessary
because there are already considerable
policies in place and reporting that oc-
curs to minimize any and all civilian
casualties.
This amendment is also unnecessary
because there is, in addition, substan-
tial and continued coordination that
occurs between the DOD and the State
Department, starting at the country
team level and extending back to the
Pentagon and Foggy Bottom, which
also includes coordination with the Na-
tional Security Council and the intel-
ligence community.
Again, we don’t want to give up our
jurisdiction on the House Armed Serv-
ices Committee when we are talking
about military operations and knowing
that our troops do anything and every-
thing they can to ensure there are zero
civilian casualties.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this amendment.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I demand

clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 31 printed

the United States and Russia have not en-
tered into a new treaty to replace the New
START Treaty, the President shall submit a
report, which shall be in an unclassified form
but may contain a classified annex, to the
appropriate congressional committees that
contains the following elements—
(1) an assessment as to whether the limits
of the New START Treaty on Russia’s stra-
tegic nuclear forces advance United States
national security interests;
(2) an explanation of how the United States
will address the imminent expiration of the
New START Treaty, including—
(A) a plan to extend the New START Trea-
ty before it expires;
(B) a plan to otherwise retain the Treaty’s
limits on Russia’s nuclear forces; or
(C) a plan to provide for the expiration of
the Treaty, including—
(i) a justification for why the expiration of
the Treaty is in the national security inter-
est of the United States; and
(ii) a plan, including steps the United
States military and the intelligence commu-
nity will take before February 5, 2021, to ac-
count for the expiration of the Treaty and
the failure to replace it with a new agree-
ment to maintain confidence in United
States nuclear deterrence requirements and
a similar level of confidence in intelligence
information regarding Russia’s nuclear
forces.
(g) DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS IN EVENT OF EXPIRATION OF
NEW START TREATY.—If the New START
Treaty expires before the United States and
Russia enter into a new arms control agree-

Russia’s nuclear forces, not later than 30
days after such expiration—
(1) the Secretary of Defense shall submit to
the appropriate congressional committees a
report describing changes to the expected
force structure of the Armed Forces and esti-
mating the expected costs necessary to make
such changes; and
(2) the Secretary of Defense and the Sec-
retary of Energy shall jointly submit to the
appropriate congressional committees a re-
port—
(A) describing the manner in which the
current United States nuclear modernization
plan, which anticipates the continued exist-
ence of the Treaty, will be modified without
the existence of the Treaty; and
(B) including—
(i) the information required to be sub-
mitted in the report required by section 1043
of the National Defense Authorization Act

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from New York (Mr. ENGEL) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, my amend-
ment is something that really should
be a no-brainer. It says we need to
maintain strong and verifiable limits
on Russia’s nuclear forces.
We all know that a robust nuclear de-
terrent has been a pillar of American
security since the beginning of the
Cold War, but so has arms control.
Democratic and Republican adminis-
trations alike have used arms control
agreements to constrain Russia’s nu-
clear forces. These agreements have al-
lowed us to keep eyes on the ground so
we can confirm what the Russians are
doing.
They have stopped arms races. They
have strengthened peace. I fear this ad-
ministration wants to throw all of that
out the window.
The President’s withdrawal from the
INF Treaty is sending us down a dan-
gerous path toward a renewed nuclear
arms race. Don’t get me wrong: Rus-
sia’s violation of the INF Treaty is un-
acceptable, but the question is how we
respond to it. Instead of using diplo-
macy and pressure to push the Rus-
sians back into compliance, the admin-
istration is following Russia’s lead and
walking away. This sends a terrible
message and signals a broader ideolog-
ical contempt for the value of arms
control.
Now the debate is shifting to New
START. This treaty has won the praise
of diplomats and defense and intel-
ligence officials as a tool for advancing
our national security interests. It al-
lows us to keep a lid on competition
with a hostile Russia. The New START
Treaty places strong limits on Russia’s
strategic nuclear forces, meaning the
nuclear weapons that can reach the
United States.
This treaty also gives us strong
mechanisms to make sure Russia is
holding up its end of the bargain. It
provides unique insights into Russia’s
nuclear forces, information that would
be impossible to replace. Indeed, up to
this point, the State Department has
certified that Russia is in full compli-
ance with the New START Treaty.
The clock is ticking. The New
START Treaty is set to expire in a
year and a half. It can be extended an-
other 5 years until 2026, but only if the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5605
July 11, 2019
United States and Russia agree to do
so.
My amendment sets out what should
be a commonsense approach. It says
that as long as Russia remains in com-
pliance with the treaty, the adminis-
tration should work to extend the New
START Treaty unless the administra-
tion can complete a replacement agree-
ment with equal or greater constraints
on the Russians.
We cannot accept anything less.
The amendment also requires a series
of reports from the administration on
potential consequences if the treaty
lapses and requires the President to
present a plan to Congress on how to
deal with these consequences.
Like so many other aspects of its for-
eign policy, the Trump administration
has sent confusing messages about ex-
tending the treaty. They recently
called it ‘‘unlikely,’’ noting a desire to
move beyond the existing arms control
regime with Russia to tackle other
issues like tactical nuclear weapons
and China.
Those are important issues, too. I
agree with that. The United States
should push ahead with a new arms
control agreement, but in the mean-
time, we shouldn’t throw out the baby
with the bathwater. We should extend
New START. After all, we cannot allow
Russia free rein to expand its nuclear
forces.
What I hope this administration un-
derstands is that arms control is a crit-
ical tool in a much broader effort as we
compete with Russia. Arms control re-
duces uncertainty. It creates patterns
and predictability. It helps us make
sure our forces and programs are tai-
lored to deal with the challenges we
are facing.
Mr. Chair, I ask Members to support
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Wyoming is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chair, I applaud
my colleague’s determination to ensure
that the United States is doing every-
thing possible to prevent the prolifera-
tion of nuclear weapons. Unfortu-
nately, I think this amendment does
not have that impact.
We are engaged now in a situation
with respect to New START, that it is
a treaty that was designed, imple-
mented, and adopted in a world that is
very different from the one in which we
live today.
Those of us on this side of the aisle
do not suggest, and are not suggesting,
that we should withdraw from the trea-
ty, so it is a little bit disingenuous for
the amendment to suggest that no
funds should be used to withdraw. We
do not want to withdraw from the trea-
ty. It is an important treaty. However,
we also think we shouldn’t blindly ex-
tend the treaty.
In today’s world, in which we know
the treaty does not cover the types of
weapons that the Russians are devel-
oping, nor does it cover at all the types
of weapons systems that the Chinese
are developing and deploying, we want
to make sure that the United States is
able to provide those kinds of restric-
tions across the board, not simply
stick to a treaty that limits only par-
ticular types of weapons systems and
only with respect to Russia.
Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment
because I think it is very important
that we not tie the President’s hands,
that we not send that message to the
President and to our adversaries.
I think the Russians would very
much like to see this treaty extended
as it is. They would very much like to
not be constrained in the development
of tactical nuclear weapons and the de-
velopment and deployment of systems
that aren’t covered by the treaty.
Those of us who are arguing in favor
of ensuring the treaty covers all the
threats would like to see a much more
robust arms control system than the
one that would be in place if we simply
extended this treaty without consid-
ering the possibility of including the
Chinese and the Russians. The adminis-
tration, in fact, has said precisely that.
The President has urged that the Na-
tional Security Council look at ways
that we can make sure the treaty cov-
ers all of our security needs, not sim-
ply extend it beyond the 2021 date.
We think it is important that the
President have that ability. We also
think it is important that the Congress
not send a message to our adversaries
that we are simply urging the Presi-
dent to extend this treaty as is.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, may I inquire
as to how much time I have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from New York has 1 minute remain-
ing.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, then let me
split it. I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
KEATING), a well-respected member of
the Foreign Affairs Committee and one
of our subcommittee chairs.
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of Chairman ENGEL’s amend-
ment, inspired by a bipartisan New
START bill, which is cosponsored by
Mr. MCCAUL, the ranking member, and
of which I am a proud cosponsor. It is
a bill that urges extension of the New
START Treaty.
Russia’s broad range of destabilizing
influence is well known. We need to do
everything we can to constrain Rus-
sia’s arsenal to the best of our ability,
and we have an effective tool in place.
We have heard from so many leaders
about why this is important, people
who support this amendment, like Gen-
eral John Hyten, Commander of the
United States Strategic Command.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I yield 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman from Massachu-
setts (Mr. MOULTON).
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I want to
point out that I agree with my col-
league that this treaty is outdated,
that Russia and China are developing
weapons that exceed what is included
here, but that is all the more reason
why we need the time afforded by ex-
tending this treaty to develop a strong-
er replacement.
We shouldn’t do what Russia wants.
That is why I oppose this President,
which Russia wants.
We need to have a stronger replace-
ment for this treaty, and this amend-
ment does exactly that. It gives us the
time to get there while ensuring our
safety in the meantime.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire as to how much time I have re-
maining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Wyoming has 21⁄2 minutes remain-
ing.
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. THORNBERRY), my colleague, the
esteemed ranking member of the
Armed Services Committee.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I simply want to make
two points.
One is that the Under Secretary of
State for Arms Control is supposed to
meet with her Russian counterpart on
this issue next week. What are we
doing? We come to the floor, and we
want to tie her hands. We want to re-
strict her ability to negotiate with the
Russians. That doesn’t make any sense
to me.
There has been discussion about
flaws in the treaty, how it has not kept
up with changes in technology. Yet the
House wants to come and say, ‘‘Well,
we think we ought to extend it any-
way,’’ giving the Russians a benefit
that they don’t have to give anything
up for.
It may be that we come to a point
where we think extending New START
makes sense. The Russians ought to
participate in that as part of a negotia-
tion, not a unilateral move for us.
Secondly, I have to note more broad-
ly in this bill that when New START
was ratified, part of the agreement
was, yes, we will go down to a lower
number of nuclear weapons, but we are
going to put increased investment into
the nuclear weapons complex to make
it more responsive, because with lower
weapons, if something goes wrong, you
have less margin for error.
This bill before us cuts the requested
funding from the nuclear weapons com-
plex. It cuts funding requested for the
Minuteman III replacement. It cuts in
a variety of ways our attempt to have
a strong nuclear deterrent.
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chair, I am pre-
pared to close.
Mr. Chair, I would like to ensure that
our colleagues recognize the limita-
tions of the treaty that my colleague,
Mr. ENGEL, is suggesting we extend.
The treaty is insufficient with re-
spect to the arms that it limits. The

treaty is insufficient with respect to
the participants in the treaty. The
treaty also has an insufficient verifica-
tion regime.
It is crucially important that we
make sure that we arm those who are
negotiating these treaties with the
support that they need to conclude a
treaty that fundamentally supports the
security of the Nation.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL).
The question was taken; and the Act-

made available for fiscal year 2020 for the Of-
fice of the Secretary of Defense, not more
than 90 percent may be obligated or ex-
pended until the date on which the Secretary
submits the study under paragraph (1) to the
congressional defense committees pursuant
to subsection (d).
(b) MATTERS INCLUDED.—The study under
subsection (a)(1) shall include the following:
(1) A comparison of the costs through 2050
of—
(A) extending the life of Minuteman III
intercontinental ballistic missiles; and
(B) delaying the ground-based strategic de-
terrent program.
(2) An analysis of opportunities to incor-
porate technologies into the Minuteman III
intercontinental ballistic missile program as
part of a service life extension program that
could also be incorporated in the future
ground-based strategic deterrent program,
including, at a minimum, opportunities to
increase the resilience against adversary
missile defenses.
(3) An analysis of the benefits and risks of
incorporating sensors and nondestructive
testing methods and technologies to reduce
destructive testing requirements and in-
crease the service life and number of Minute-
man III missiles through 2050.
(4) An analysis and validation of the meth-
ods used to estimate the operational service
life of Minuteman II and Minuteman III mo-
tors, taking into account the test and launch
experience of motors retired after the oper-
ational service life of such motors in the
rocket systems launch program.
(5) An analysis of the risks and benefits of
alternative methods of estimating the oper-
ational service life of Minuteman III motors,
such as those methods based on fundamental
physical and chemical processes and non-
destructive measurements of individual
motor properties.
(c) SUBMISSION TO DOD.—Not later than 180
days after the date of the enactment of this
Act, the federally funded research and devel-
opment center shall submit to the Secretary
a report containing the study conducted
under subsection (a)(1).
(d) SUBMISSION TO CONGRESS.—Not later
than 210 days after the date of the enactment
of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the

(a)(1) shall be in unclassified form, but may
include a classified annex.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oregon.
b 1515
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself 2 minutes.
I would first begin by extending my
congratulations to the chair and the
committee for taking a hard look at
this legislation to better meet the
needs of the military and the taxpayer
in long-term, stable, careful military
policy. I think they have made tremen-
dous strides. I would like to try to
make it just a tiny bit better.
Mr. Chair, we are looking at a Min-
uteman III extension on a land-based
intercontinental ballistic missile sys-
tem, and I am proposing that we have
a study as to whether or not we could
be better served by simply extending
the life of the existing system as op-
posed to new development.
Frankly, there needs to be more at-
tention by this Congress, and I appre-
ciate the attention that the committee
has given.
The ICBM is the leg of the triad that
raises the most questions. There has
been a RAND study on the future of the
ICBM force that found that a new al-
ternative is very likely to cost two or
three times more than incremental
modernization.
We are careening toward a $1.3 tril-
lion or more investment in nuclear
weapons that, frankly, do not help us
for most of our national security chal-
lenges that we face now, weapons that
we simply can’t afford and can’t afford
to use.
I think by trying to right-size the
work that we are doing and by taking
a hard look at this element with a
study on extending the life, it is a rea-
sonable, responsible, cost-effective ef-
fort. I strongly urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting it.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chair, this amend-
ment’s language is so wrong that it was
resoundingly rejected in the Armed
Services Committee by a voice vote. It
is very basic and easy to understand as
to why it was rejected.
This missile, and it relates to a mis-
sile upon which there is a nuclear war-
head, was put on the ground in 1973.
Richard Nixon was President of the
United States. The year before these
were put in the ground, in December of
that year, was the last time we were on
the Moon, in 1972. This was just at the
end of the Apollo program. This is
technology that is incredibly outdated.
If you think about the Apollo pro-
gram and the Moon launch, you think,
well, the next technology is the space
shuttle. That launched in 1981, almost
a decade after these were put in the
ground. Even the space shuttle is re-
tired, yet he wants to resurrect these.
This is as ridiculous as saying, ‘‘We
are going to go to the Moon again.
Let’s go to the museum and pull out
the Apollo mooncrafts. Let’s just jigger
them up again and put them up into
space.’’
It is not going to work. This is abso-
lutely irresponsible, but it is not really
about just trying to extend this life,
because this has been studied before.
This would be a study of a restudy of a
restudy of a restudy.
In addition, this is not only a study.
This delays the program.
Everyone wonders why nuclear weap-
ons cost so much. They cost so much
because we delay and delay and delay.
This will be another one of those that
would just continue the prospects of
our having a decaying of our nuclear
deterrent and, in addition to that, in-
creased costs as a result of increased
delay.
I know Mr. BLUMENAUER has been a
very strong advocate against nuclear
weapons. I understand his interest in
trying to prohibit and thwart our ef-
forts to modernize nuclear weapons,
but if you look at what our adversaries
are doing, what China is doing, what
Russia is doing, it is absolutely irre-
sponsible to say that a Richard Nixon-
era missile that is in the ground, that
has been there since we were last on
the Moon, should just be refurbished
and put back in the ground and expect
that we are going to be safe.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Washington (Mr. SMITH), the distin-
guished chair of the committee.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
three quick points.
First of all, Richard Nixon era or not,
I think we all agree that the missile
right now is working. I certainly hope
it is since we are relying on it as a key
part of our nuclear deterrent.
We have a lot of weapons systems. I
mean, I am surprised that the B–52
bomber is still functional, but it is.
To imply that somehow because it is
old, by definition, it doesn’t work, I
hope that is not true. In fact, I know it
is not true because the current missile
works perfectly fine and is a more than
adequate deterrent.
Second, the studies that have been
done were trying to figure out if we
could get away with keeping this mis-
sile for the entire projected 80-year
lifespan of its replacement. The studies
have come back and said, no, it prob-
ably will not last 80 years. We have not
studied whether or not it could last an-
other 25 or another 50.
That is the purpose of this amend-
ment. That would save us money.
Look, we need a nuclear deterrent. I
don’t believe the gentleman from Or-
egon—certainly, I don’t—supports get-
ting rid of our nuclear weapons. The
question is, how many do we need?
What does the deterrent look like?
What makes sense?
It is clear that this missile works
now. If we did this study, it is quite
reasonable to presume that it would
work another 10, 20, 30 years from now.
Then that money could be used for
other defense priorities.
This is to answer that question,
which is very important.
I will skip the third point.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I
yield an additional 20 seconds to the
gentleman from Washington (Mr.
SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
all I was going to say is that the voice
vote in our committee was not over-
whelming. I am the one who called the
voice vote, and it was my sense that
the amendment was agreed to in the
committee, but it was not over-
whelming. There was a large number of
members of the Armed Services Com-
mittee who supported the proposal that
Mr. BLUMENAUER is now making.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5618 July 11, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chair, we should
turn to the experts when we talk about
how long this can be extended. This
amendment would try to take this
Richard Nixon-era missile to 2050. Gen-
eral Hyten, who is the person who is
charged with having expertise with
this, came before us March 28, 2019.
This year, he said all studies have been
done. This cannot be extended.
The only reason this amendment is
here is to try to delay doing what we
need to do and what the experts say,
which is not refurbish this missile but
move forward with replacement.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP).
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, look,
the Minuteman III has been a great de-
terrent and a great source of security
for this country, but it is 46 years old.
It was put in the ground when I was in
college, and I can’t even remember
what I was doing in college.
It has already been extended three
times.
As Mr. TURNER said, the testimony in
our committee said that we have stud-
ied this, and the conclusion was more
study and more delay was not cost-ef-
fective.
Look at the reality of the situation.
If we move into a new system, we have
to have the infrastructure to make
that move so the system can be seam-
less going from place to place.
If we pause in that reconstruction of
infrastructure, what we do is stop the
construction. Then, we have to start up
again, which is why the cost continues
to increase.
There are parts of Minuteman III
that are no longer being produced in
the private sector, so the engineers at
the Air Force logistics centers have to
rejigger from old parts a new part. In
fact, the blueprints in some cases are
so old, they are not readable anymore.
We have to move forward. This
amendment stops us from modernizing
our efforts. The GBSD has to move for-
ward.
Let’s face it: The only reason it is
not moving forward right now is be-
cause it doesn’t have a cute name like
Minuteman III. But it is our future. If
we want something in our future, we
cannot tolerate more delays. This
amendment for another study does
nothing more than delay what we can
actually come up with, the new genera-
tion of what we need to defend this
country.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, may I
inquire as to the amount of time re-
maining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon has 13⁄4 minutes remain-
ing.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, my
colleague has the right to close?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio has 1 minute remaining and
has the right to close.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself 15 seconds to reassure my
good friend from Utah that the Minute-
man missile doesn’t have to remember
what it was doing in the past. It simply
has to launch.
To the notion that it is a Nixon-era
weapon, we are flying B–52s, which are
not just Lyndon Johnson but those are
of the Kennedy era.
Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my
time to the gentleman from California
(Mr. GARAMENDI), my good friend.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I want
to engage in a discussion because it is
extremely important here.
I thank my good friend, Mr. TURNER,
for raising some issues. Indeed, we
might be better off going to the mu-
seum and getting the Apollo because
the current Moon launch system isn’t
working too well, well over budget and
well delayed. But the issue at hand has
to do with these missiles.
There is clarity that this can be de-
layed. In one of our hearings, General
Clark said it can be refurbished once
again.
Other hearings have provided infor-
mation that the key here is the com-
mand and control system, which is in-
deed antiquated and which indeed must
be refurbished and rebuilt. We ought to
spend our time on that.
This amendment does not delay the
ground-based system. What it does is it
gives us the information so that we can
make an informed decision about when
to engage and spend the $100 billion to
$150 billion on the new ground-based
missile system.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, did
my friend from California not com-
pletely exhaust the time allotted?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon has 30 seconds remaining.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I
yield the balance of my time to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
GARAMENDI).
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, if you
are around here long enough, your
mind can go in 1-minute sections, and
I was right on the 1 minute and 15. I
will try to close very quickly on this in
the next few seconds.
Mr. Chair, this amendment doesn’t
stop the ground-based system from
going forward. It simply gives us, the
decisionmakers, the opportunity to
make a very informed decision about
when we must renew this system.
There is clear evidence, clear discus-
sion in various areas, that an addi-
tional period of time is available before
we initiate and go full bore into the
new ground-based system. Let’s get in-
formation. Let’s get knowledge.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chair, I yield such
time as he may consume to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY).
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, it
seems to me the studies that have been
conducted make it clear that it makes
no cost sense to try to extend the life
of these missiles that have been in
place for so long.
I think what is really at stake here is
whether the three legs of the triad
upon which our defense has depended
for so many decades are to be renewed,
modernized, and remain credible.
Each leg of that triad, the sub-
marines, the air leg, and the missiles
that we are talking about now, have
unique characteristics. It is the three
of them working together that has
been so successful in making sure that
our country has been protected and
that no nuclear weapon has been used
since the end of World War II.
It is essential to modernize the land
leg base of our triad to make sure that
it stays credible, modern, and safe.
That is why this amendment should be
rejected.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chair, I demand a
recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Oregon will be
postponed.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oregon.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I
have an amendment here that would
deal with a study on the cost-effective-
ness of the W80–4 Life Extension Pro-
gram.
We have been having these debates
over the years before the committee on
this issue of nuclear weapons. I am
deeply troubled that we really haven’t
done a deep dive on the floor of the
House in terms of the path we have
been on.
b 1530
I have settled, in the past, for trying
to have some studies to determine
whether or not what we are doing going
forward is actually cost-effective.
In this case, the father of this device,
former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry,
has argued that there is scant justifica-
tion for spending tens of billions of dol-
lars on new weapons. General Mattis
has stated numerous times that he is
not sold on the LRSO.
I simply want to make sure that we
know what we are getting into, what
the costs are, in terms of some of the
increases that are going forward.
We need to do a better job of our
oversight, our debate. These weapons
have not been used, as the gentleman
said, since the end of World War II. It
is not at all clear that we needed to
have the volume of weapons we had,
the number of delivery systems. In
fact, there is strong argument that we
could have done a better job, or just as
good a job, of deterrence with less. And
there have been a whole host of prob-
lems in the past in terms of mis-
management, accident that we have
narrowly avoided disaster.
I think this is a small step forward,
and I would respectfully request that
the study be approved.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, we are
blazing along on the timeline of nu-
clear weapons and missile development
where we had a missile that was last
placed in the ground in 1973 during
Richard Nixon’s second term, after he
was elected to a second term. We now
have a 1980 Jimmy Carter-era warhead.
The analogy of the B–52 doesn’t apply
to this technology. The B–52 is a plane
that has been in continuous flight. We
are not talking about a plane that has
been put in a hangar since Jimmy Car-
ter. These are items that we don’t use.
Nuclear weapons are there as a deter-
rent to deter our adversaries. The only
way we can deter our adversaries is to
have them believe that any aggression
against us would be matched with such
overwhelming force that it would be at
their great risk.
To the extent that we allow our nu-
clear deterrent to degrade, which we
have with Nixon-era missiles and Car-
ter-era weapons, we lessen our overall
security. Now, this is—again, it sounds
like just a study. It is not really a
study. It is a study of a study of a re-
study of a restudy. This has been stud-
ied so much, in fact, it is on a bipar-
tisan basis that this W–84 warhead
needs to be refurbished, needs to be
redone.
Even the Obama administration had
an analysis of all alternatives and con-
cluded that the air-launched cruise
missile and its warhead could not be
sustained and had already experienced
reduced survivability. Even the Obama
administration said, Don’t do this.
They said, Move forward.
Now, once again, this is not about a
study. This is about stopping the ongo-
ing efforts of a program. This is about
holding moneys back so that we don’t
modernize our nuclear weapons. Again,
China is moving forward; Russia is
moving forward. But here we are, on
the floor of Congress, trying to stop
our ability to match and meet those
who might wish to do us harm.
This amendment needs to be de-
feated. This is an ancient 1980s Carter-
era warhead. Even the Obama adminis-
tration agrees it needs to be replaced.
We should not jeopardize its funding.
Every time we do this, every time we
stop and say, Let’s study this, our
costs go up and our risks go higher and
our security gets lower.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman,
how much time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon has 3 minutes remaining.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. SMITH), the dis-
tinguished chairman of the committee.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, this is a little bit smaller
than what the gentleman from Ohio
implied. We are stopping the funding of
this program. Actually, what we are
stopping is the additional $185 million
request that NNSA and the President
requested in this budget on top of this.
The missile would continue to be fund-
ed.
This is a concern we had in com-
mittee. We talked about it and we let
it go.
But they have not really told us what
they are going to do with this addi-
tional $185 million. And we have con-
cerns, in addition to the concerns that
Mr. BLUMENAUER raised about the effi-
cacy of the program, about whether or
not they are going to be able to exe-
cute this $185 million and what their
exact timeline is for the program. In
fact, the Air Force recently said that
they were delaying by a year or two
certain steps in the development of
this missile while saying they were
also going to be able to still meet the
ultimate deadline for deployment.
But the specific $185 million that is
expensed is an amount that was asked
for in addition to what had originally
been planned for FY20. We do not have
an adequate explanation, in my view,
and in Mr. BLUMENAUER’s view, from
DOD as to why they want that addi-
tional $185 million, and that is the pur-
pose of this. It is not studying the en-
tire missile. It is saying, why are you
accelerating the program and asking
for this additional money? So I support
this amendment.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. THORNBERRY).
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
appreciate the gentleman yielding.
Mr. Chairman, my understanding is
that, in January of this year, the inde-
pendent Office of Cost Estimating and
Program Evaluation, which is part of
the Department of Energy’s NNSA,
provided a report and an objective
analysis of this program. Everything
that they reported was that the pro-
gram remains on budget as expected
for the first production unit by fiscal
year 2025.
I think what has happened is that
they have a greater opportunity, a
greater need, to spend more money
from 2019 to 2020 than they originally
planned. Now, that can occur for sev-
eral reasons.
Number one, a program can start to
move a little faster so you can make
good use of money. Unfortunately,
what sometimes happens is once you
start looking into some of these very
old warheads, you discover problems
that need some resources in order to
deal with those problems.
Now, we can’t really talk on the floor
about the specific concerns with any
particular warhead today because of
classification. But the key point is, the
overall funding program has remained
consistent and perfectly within the
guidelines of what was planned origi-
nally.
Again, I am afraid that this amend-
ment, like the last one, is delayed by
study. We can study things to death,

but we have not done what we should
to renew the three legs of the triad and
the weapons which constitute our nu-
clear deterrence, and upon which our
security depends. We have basically
reached the point where we have no
margin for error. We have to move
ahead with submarines, we have to
move ahead with the new bomber, we
have to move ahead with the Minute-
man III replacement, and we have to
move ahead with the warhead replace-
ment, not only to make sure they
work, but to make sure the people
around them are safe. That is the cru-
cial point.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. GARAMENDI).
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman,
with enormous respect to my col-
leagues who are opposed to this amend-
ment, I think this amendment makes
enormous sense. It is $185 million of ad-
ditional money that has been requested
in just the last couple of months to
move this program forward.
We ought to be very careful here be-
cause the NNSA is only 50 percent sure
that it is a $12 billion program. That is
on the upside, not on the downside. So
we are talking about something very
expensive.
It is unfortunate that we have di-
vided this extraordinarily important
debate about the future of our nuclear
systems into 5-minute segments. This
ought to be a 5-hour debate on the
floor. I see my colleagues nodding their
head.
A fundamental question is being
asked here about where we are going
with our nuclear enterprises. We do
know this: We are in the midst of a
three-party nuclear arms race. And
this one is going to be extremely dan-
gerous because the weapons are bigger;
they are safer, to be sure, but they are
more likely to explode; and, finally,
they are going to be delivered by
stealth technology.
Sad, but true, we need a 5-hour de-
bate on this entire thing.
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I under-
stand that there are people who don’t
like nuclear weapons. I don’t like nu-
clear weapons either, but I don’t like
nuclear weapons in the hands of other
people. And, yes, there are those who
say that we are in the middle of an
arms race. But the reality is that we
are sitting this one out. We are not in
the arms race.
When we are debating on the House
floor about a warhead from the Carter-
era and a missile from the Nixon-era
and we can’t even talk about moving
forward on funding, there is no race
here. We are sitting this out. But our
adversaries are racing, and I am con-
cerned about what they are doing. That
is why this is important that this be
defeated.
But another aspect of this that is in-
credibly important is that this calls for
an independent study. Independent:
That is saying they don’t trust the
study that happened before. The study
that happened before was the Obama
administration. I think their answer
was correct: We need to not study this
and we need to move forward.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman,
how much time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon has 45 seconds remaining.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman,
let me just make three points.
First and foremost, anybody who
thinks that we are standing still and
defenseless is not in the real world. We
are spending billions of dollars on nu-
clear weapons and delivery systems.
And, in fact, we are relying on a deliv-
ery system from the Kennedy-era with
the B–52. So I say to the gentleman,
don’t tell me that we cannot move
these items forward.
Second, the gentleman does not have
a good fix in terms of what is hap-
pening with the cost increases. This
study is required to be able to have the
additional money. If we can do the ap-
propriate study and it makes sense, the
money is there. But this is a step to-
wards accountability and it is long,
long overdue, and I hope we can start
now approving this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I
demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Oregon will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 34 OFFERED BY MS. FRANKEL
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 34 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle G of title XII, add
the following:
SEC. l. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR
SHORTER- OR INTERMEDIATE-
RANGE GROUND LAUNCHED BAL-
LISTIC OR CRUISE MISSILE SYS-
TEMS.
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s Feb-
ruary 1, 2019, announcement of the decision
of the United States to withdraw from the
INF Treaty, without proper consultation
with Congress, is a serious breach of
Congress’s proper constitutional role as a co-
equal branch of government;
(2) United States withdrawal from the INF
Treaty will free Russia to deploy greater
quantities of the SSC–8 missile to the det-
riment of United States national security
and that of our allies in Europe and the Indo-
Pacific region;
(3) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) alliance makes critical contribu-
tions to United States national security, and
the failure to weigh the concerns of NATO
allies risks weakening the joint resolve nec-
essary to counter Russia’s aggressive behav-
ior;
(4) as opposed to withdrawing from the INF
Treaty, the United States should continue to
advance other diplomatic, economic, and
military measures outlined in the ‘‘Trump
Administration INF Treaty Integrated
Strategy’’ to resolve the concerns related to
Russia’s violation of the INF Treaty and to
reach agreement on measures to ensure the
INF Treaty’s future viability; and
(5) further, in lieu of withdrawing from the
INF Treaty, the United States should look at
options to expand arms control treaties to
include China in an effort to limit its short-
and intermediate-range missiles.
(b) PROHIBITION.—None of the funds author-
ized to be appropriated by this Act or other-
wise made available for the Department of
Defense for fiscal year 2020 may be made
available for the research, development,
testing, evaluation, procurement, or deploy-
ment of a United States shorter- or inter-
mediate-range ground launched ballistic or
cruise missile system with a range between
500 and 5,500 kilometers until the following
has been submitted to the appropriate com-
mittees of Congress:
(1) A report from the Secretary of Defense,
jointly with the Secretary of State and the
Director of National Intelligence, that in-
cludes—
(A) a detailed diplomatic proposal for ne-
gotiating an agreement to obtain the stra-
tegic stability benefits of the INF Treaty;
(B) an assessment of the implications, in
terms of the military threat to the United
States and its allies in Europe and the Indo-
Pacific region, of Russian deployment of in-
termediate-range cruise and ballistic mis-
siles without restriction;
(C) identification of what types of tech-
nologies and programs the United States
would need to pursue to offset the additional
Russian capabilities, and at what cost;
(D) identification of what mission require-
ments will be met by INF Treaty-type sys-
tems; and
(E) details regarding ramifications of a col-
lapse of the INF Treaty on the ability to
generate consensus among States Parties to
the NPT Treaty ahead of the 2020 NPT Re-
view Conference, and assesses the degree to
which Russia will use the United States uni-
lateral withdrawal to sow discord within the
NATO alliance.
(2) A copy or copies of at least one Memo-
randum of Understanding from a NATO or
Indo-Pacific ally that commits it to host de-
ployment of any such ballistic or cruise mis-
sile system on its own territory, and in the
case of deployment on the European con-
tinent, has the concurrence of the North At-
lantic Council.
(3) An unedited copy of an analysis of al-
ternatives conducted by the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Cost
Assessment and Program Evaluation that
considers other ballistic or cruise missile
systems, to include sea- and air-launched
missiles, that could be deployed to meet cur-
rent capability gaps due to INF Treaty re-
strictions, and further to include cost, sched-
ule, and operational considerations.
(c) FORM.—The documents required by
paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (b)
shall be submitted in unclassified form, but
may contain a classified annex.
(d) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in
this section may be construed to authorize
the use of funds described in subsection (b)
for the research, development, testing, eval-
uation, procurement, or deployment of INF

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Chairman, I
think there are a few of us here in Con-
gress who are old enough to remember
a time when we actually did nuclear
bomb drills in school. It probably
would have been a futile action had
there been a real attack.
And although nuclear warfare is still
an existential threat to all of us and
our allies around the world, it has been
arms control that has let us go about
our lives daily without that worry of
nuclear war: agreements like the Inter-
mediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty,
known as the INF Treaty, signed in
1987 between the United States and the
Soviet Union, which led to the elimi-
nation of thousands of United States
and Russian nuclear missiles.
In recent years, it has become appar-
ent that Russia has been violating this
treaty. And in response, in February,
the Trump administration announced
its withdrawal to the consternation of
our European friends, giving both the
United States and Russia freedom to
produce more nuclear weapons.
And it is the general consensus of the
arms control community that we
should be working with Russia to bring
them back into compliance instead of
adding to our nuclear arsenal and
sidestepping NATO.
b 1545
Once again, this administration is
alienating allies who don’t want to be
targets for Russian attacks. The NATO
Secretary General said, clearly: We do
not intend to deploy new land-based
nuclear missiles in Europe.
In recent testimony before Congress,
General Paul Selva, the Vice Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated:
There are no military requirements
that we cannot currently satisfy due to
our compliance with the INF Treaty.
In other words, the world has enough
nuclear weapons to destroy civiliza-
tion.
It is clear that our withdrawal from
INF has been driven by extreme ele-
ments in our administration who have
made their careers out of destroying
arms control agreements.
To stop this nuclear escalation, my
amendment would prohibit funding for
missile systems noncompliant with the
INF Treaty unless the Defense Depart-
ment demonstrates an ally has agreed
to host the INF missile and that we
have exhausted all other diplomatic
options.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment to prevent a dangerous and
costly nuclear arms race. Enough is
enough.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting Chair. The gentleman
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
This is a dangerous amendment. The
Trump administration withdrew from
the INF Treaty because Russia had
been cheating on this treaty for years.
The only country that was in compli-
ance with the INF Treaty was the
United States, and we were handcuffing
ourselves by putting limitations on our
ability to respond to threats from Rus-
sia or China since we were the only
country in the world complying with
it.
China was not a signatory to the INF
Treaty. This was, like was said, signed
32 years ago. China was not the mili-
tary power that it is today. It was not
a party to this treaty.
Going forward, I would love to see
some kind of treaty between the U.S.
and Russia and China, but that is not
in the works if this amendment is
passed. This ignores China.
China has more missiles in the Pa-
cific region than anyone else in the
world. They have more, certainly, than
the United States. So that is another
flaw with this amendment.
Russia has been cheating on this, and
to say we are going to comply with the
terms of the treaty regardless of what
Russia does is to reward them for their
cheating.
One other key point that makes this
a dangerous amendment is because it
would prevent the testing necessary for
the growth of our missile defense pro-
gram. The INF Treaty that this would
put us back into—in a backdoor kind of
way—prohibits testing or deployment
of missiles with the range of 500 to 5,500
kilometers. Those are the kinds of
tests that we need to be able to do to
test our missile defense systems.
The Department of Defense stated,
just a couple of days ago:
Land-based missiles required to support
ballistic missile defense system flight test-
ing also have ranges between 500 and 5,500
kilometers. Loss of target missile capability
would likely prohibit upcoming missile de-
fense flight tests requiring such target mis-
siles.
And they go on to say:
This will limit the warfighter. It will limit
our missile defense capabilities.
That is a dangerous thing.
There is some dispute over whether
allies like Israel would be included in
this ban of test vehicles. I will leave
that for another discussion, but it is a
serious issue.
It would certainly prohibit our test-
ing of our missile defense systems be-
tween the range of 500 to 5,500 kilo-
meters. That would cripple our growth
of missile defense for the future. That
doesn’t make the world a safer place. It
certainly doesn’t make the United
States a safer place.
So, for all of those reasons, Mr.
Chairman, this is a bad amendment,
and I would urge that we reject it and
vote ‘‘no.’’
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Chair, how much
time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Florida has 21⁄2 minutes remain-
ing.
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Chair, let me
just respond by saying, according to
the Department of Defense, there is
nothing in this amendment that would
impact missile defense test systems.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL).
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I am
pleased to support this amendment.
There has been some misinformation
out there about what this amendment
would actually do, so let me just clear
up a few things.
This measure is a prohibition on the
United States deploying a short- or in-
termediate-range ground-launched bal-
listic or cruise missile system—just the
United States. It has nothing to do
with any other country.
We want to prevent an arms race. We
want to push back on the President’s
careless and reckless approach to Rus-
sia.
The INF Treaty has been a corner-
stone of arms control for 30 years. Yes,
we are clear about the threat Russia
poses. Yes, Russia has violated this
treaty again and again, which threat-
ens transatlantic security and sta-
bility. This is no surprise, coming from
Vladimir Putin.
But we have to use every diplomatic
tool at our disposal to try to salvage
the treaty. Instead, the administration
followed Putin’s lead and walked away,
and now Russia will feel totally uncon-
strained to start another arms race.
So I know that the relationship with
Putin and all kinds of things that
Putin does, we have to be very, very
wary about it, and I just think what
the gentlewoman is doing is a common-
sense approach to this.
The United States can go back at any
time and change our policy. And when
it comes to Russia and Putin, we don’t
trust them. Trust and verify.
I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I would
like to inquire how much time both
sides have remaining.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5622 July 11, 2019
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado has 2 minutes remain-
ing. The gentlewoman from Florida has
11⁄4 minutes remaining.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I am
going to make a brief statement and
then yield to the gentleman from Ohio.
First, let me say that this doesn’t
just put us back in the INF, which
would be bad enough. This puts us in a
worse posture than the INF. This
amendment is more stringent on our
ability to develop our defensive capa-
bilities than the INF would be.
Specifically, the INF has an exemp-
tion for interceptors; this does not. So
we can’t do interceptor tests. We could
have under INF, but we can’t under
this amendment.
And, also, there is an exception for
ballistic missiles without warheads for
testing our defenses. That is in INF; it
is not in this amendment. This is worse
than the INF, which is bad enough.
I yield the balance of my time to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER).
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, this is
very basic. You cannot have a treaty
with yourself. You must have a treaty
with someone else. If that other person
steps out of the treaty, you no longer
have a treaty.
Russia stepped out of the Inter-
mediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
The North Atlantic Council all came
together and confirmed it. At the last
NATO summit, every one of our allies
confirmed it. The treaty is dead.
To have a treaty, now, where the
other side has stepped out and it is
only us that is left and say, by statute,
we are going to shackle ourselves so
that we are going to stay there has no
reflection on reality.
Their violating the treaties aren’t
minor violations of the treaty. They
have developed, tested, and deployed a
weapon that violates the treaty. That
means that they are once again deploy-
ing nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons
for which we don’t have a response.
Our response doesn’t necessarily have
to be go field one. We can continue di-
plomacy. But legislation is not diplo-
macy. By legislation, we are going to
say that the United States shall for-
ever, as long as the legislation stays in,
be tied to a treaty that the person on
the other side already left and deployed
missiles that are pointed at our assets,
our military people, our men and
women in uniform, and our allies. This
is folly.
Now, the Missile Defense Agency, by
the way, issued a statement that says
this affects our cooperation with Israel
and our interceptor research with
them.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI).
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, oh, my,
we definitely need 5 hours. This is ex-
traordinarily important. In fact, it is
the United States that terminated its
role in the INF Treaty when President
Trump pulled out of the treaty. Pre-
sumably, Russia is still in, although
they are clearly violating the treaty.
We lost whatever leverage there may
have been.
We are now in the midst of, what I
said a moment ago, one more stage of
a nuclear arms race. All of us better
take a deep breath here and begin some
serious negotiations, because this time
it is extraordinarily dangerous.
In addition to that, please under-
stand that our allies on whose land
these missiles may be placed are not in
agreement that they should be placed
there, and so there really is no plan for
the deployment, let alone exactly how
these missiles would be done.
By the way, we clearly have alter-
native ways of delivering nuclear weap-
ons: short-range, long-range, inter-
continental ballistic missiles, and most
every other way except no longer in a
briefcase or in a projectile, fortu-
nately.
So it is not harmful to delay this. It
is not harmful to make sure that our
allies are in sync with us as to how
they may be deployed.
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Chair, how much
time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Florida has 15 seconds remaining.
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Chairman, let me
just say this.
The Department of Defense says that
nothing in this amendment would im-
pact missile defense cooperation with
Israel.
I just want to end by saying: Enough
is enough. Diplomacy, not more nu-
clear weapons.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from Florida will be

AMENDMENT NO. 35 OFFERED BY LANGEVIN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 35 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle B of title XXXI, add
the following new section:
SEC. 31ll. FUNDING FOR LOW-ENRICHED URA-
NIUM RESEARCH AND DEVELOP-
MENT.
(a) INCREASE.—Notwithstanding the
amounts set forth in the funding tables in di-
vision D, the amount authorized to be appro-
priated by this title for defense nuclear non-
proliferation, as specified in the cor-
responding funding table in section 4701, for
low-enriched uranium research and develop-
ment is hereby increased by $20,000,000.
(b) OFFSET.—Notwithstanding the amounts
set forth in the funding tables in division D,
the amount authorized to be appropriated by
this title for atomic energy defense activi-
ties, as specified in the corresponding fund-
ing table in section 4701, for Federal salaries
and expenses is hereby reduced by $20,000,000.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Rhode Island.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, my amendment funds
ongoing efforts to assess the viability
of using low-enriched uranium fuel in
naval reactors, including those in air-
craft carriers and submarines, some-
thing this Congress has supported for
many years now.
The United States has demonstrated
strong leadership to minimize, and
wherever possible all but eliminate,
the use of highly enriched uranium for
civilian purposes. Doing so reduces the
risk of nuclear terrorism and makes
clear that the accumulation of HEU is
solely for nuclear weapons purposes,
undercutting any nation’s argument
that they need it for anything else.
Using low-enriched uranium, or LEU,
in naval reactor fuel can bring signifi-
cant national security benefits with re-
spect to nuclear nonproliferation,
lower security costs, and put naval re-
actor research and development at the
cutting edge of science. Pursuing the
development of LEU fuel offers the op-
portunity to achieve transformational
progress on fuel technology.
Additionally, unless an alternative
using low-enriched uranium fuel is de-
veloped in the coming decades, the
United States will have to resume pro-
duction of bomb-grade uranium for the
first time since 1992, ultimately under-
mining U.S. nonproliferation efforts.
Using LEU for naval reactors is not a
pipe dream. France’s nuclear Navy al-
ready has converted from using HEU to
using LEU fuel for its vessels. We must
evaluate the feasibility of a similar
transition for the U.S. Navy and take
into account the potential benefits to
the U.S. and international security of
setting a norm of using LEU instead of
nuclear bomb-grade material.
b 1600
As America confronts the threat of
nuclear terrorism and as countries con-
tinue to enrich uranium for naval pur-
poses, the imperative to reduce the use
of HEU will become increasingly im-
portant over the next several decades.
As such, as I said, Congress has
sought to advance these efforts in a bi-
partisan, bicameral way over the last
several years by evaluating the poten-
tial of utilizing LEU fuel in reactors
for U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and sub-
marines.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.

July 11, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Virginia is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, I would
like to point out that there have been
multiple studies done on this.
In 2014, the Department of Defense
and the Department of the Navy point-
ed out the negative impacts that low-
enriched uranium would have on the
capability of the Navy.
In 2016, another report, and I remind
the folks here in the Chamber that this
report was specific about saying the
negative impacts that low-enriched
uranium will have on the capability of
our United States Navy.
In 2018, letters from both the Direc-
tor of Naval Reactors, Admiral
Caldwell, and from the Secretary of the
Navy, Richard Spencer, all stated the
negative impact that low-enriched ura-
nium would have on the capability of
the Navy.
We look, too, at the dollars that are
being proposed to offset this. The $20
million reduction in the National Nu-
clear Security Administration would
reduce salaries in that area by 15 per-
cent.
According to NNSA, this reduction
would likely require a reduction in
force to achieve this staffing level.
They will let people go if this money is
transferred to another study, a study
that has been done multiple times in
the past with the same outcomes, that
this would have a harmful effect on the
National Nuclear Security Administra-
tion.
They also say that the amendment
would negate recently implemented
improvements in oversight and ac-
countability and slow down the execu-
tion of critical nuclear security and
safety programs.
It would also affect weapons mod-
ernization and nuclear nonproliferation
efforts. The same thing the gentleman
from Rhode Island said that this bill is
meant to address, it actually takes
money away from the efforts that
NNSA is putting forward.
It also would inhibit physical secu-
rity, cybersecurity, and environmental
remediation programs.
Not only has this study been done
multiple times, but it would take
money away from the critical elements
that are being proposed that this study
would seek to find out. Again, the con-
clusions have already been reached.
The impact of LEU on the Nation’s
naval capability has already been iden-
tified.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, let me
say that we can’t fear the future. We
must invest in research and develop-
ment.
I want to point out that the then-
chair, the Naval Reactors Director, Ad-
miral Richardson, testified before the
House Armed Services Committee. He
said, with current technology, ‘‘the po-
tential exists that we could develop an
advanced fuel system that might in-
crease uranium loading and make low-
enriched uranium possible while still
meeting some very rigorous perform-
ance requirements for naval reactors
on nuclear-powered warships.’’
To address the concerns of my col-
league, I want to mention that this
House has already included $20 million
for this research in the Energy and
Water appropriations package that
passed the House on June 19, which
also included a $15 million increase to
NNSA Federal salaries and expenses
over fiscal year 2019.
These spending levels have already
been set by the House. This amend-
ment simply matches the authoriza-
tion level with the House-passed appro-
priations level.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, I remind
the gentleman from Rhode Island that
this is the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. It is not another appropria-
tions bill. This is specific to the use of
these dollars here for these purposes
specifically.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs.
LURIA).
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Chair, as a Navy
veteran, I believe in focusing our lim-
ited resources toward efforts that will
make our forces more effective, reli-
able, and efficient.
I oppose this amendment that would
decrease the National Nuclear Security
Administration’s budget by $20 million
and allocate the money to a program
to develop low-enriched uranium fuel
for submarines and aircraft carriers.
Drawing on my 20-year Navy experi-
ence in the supervision and operation
of naval nuclear propulsion systems, it
makes little sense to divert these re-
sources. Our highly enriched uranium
reactor design has successfully powered
our submarine fleet, delivering a crit-
ical leg of our nuclear deterrent and
our aircraft carriers, providing our
unique sustained forward presence ca-
pability for nearly seven decades.
There is no need for this amendment.
Top Navy leadership and the Sec-
retary of Energy clearly state that a
low-enriched uranium design for naval
nuclear propulsion ‘‘would result in a
reactor design that is inherently less
capable, more expensive, and unlikely
to support current life-of-ship sub-
marine reactors.’’
Meanwhile, Admiral James Caldwell,
Director of the Naval Nuclear Propul-
sion Program, says that investing in
LEU would negatively impact reactor
endurance, reactor size, and ship costs,
and its success is ‘‘not assured.’’
I have no doubt that we could even-
tually develop a reactor design using
LEU, but would it continue to meet
our operational and strategic defense
needs? No. It would make our plat-
forms inherently less capable, less
operationally available, and more ex-
pensive to operate. In turn, it would re-
quire more of these assets to accom-
plish the same objectives.
If the genesis behind this amendment
is to advance issues of nonprolifera-
tion, it makes little sense to draw
down the budget of the very agency
that is tasked with the security of nu-
clear weapons and nuclear fuel.
I will conclude as I began. We need to
commit our limited resources where
they are most efficiently used to sup-
port our operational forces and our na-
tional defense. These dollars are best
spent on the National Nuclear Security
Administration.
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire how much time remains on both
sides.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Rhode Island has 2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Virginia
has 45 seconds remaining.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I urge my
colleagues to support the amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my
time to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. FOSTER), who is the House’s only
nuclear physicist.
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise today as the only
Ph.D. physicist in the U.S. Congress.
During my career, I have designed and
led the construction of giant particle
accelerators and other nuclear equip-
ment, led high-risk and successful R&D
programs, and designed equipment
using classified neutron transport
codes.
Because of its importance to national
security and nuclear nonproliferation,
I have studied at length the question of
minimizing the use of highly enriched
uranium in naval propulsion reactors. I
received numerous individual and high-
ly technical classified briefings, exam-
ined reactor core specifications, and
visited the naval nuclear fuel fabrica-
tion facility in Virginia.
I believe that continuing the re-
search supported by this amendment is
worth pursuing for the reasons given
by my colleague.
Several factors must be dealt with in
determining the practicality of uti-
lizing LEU in naval propulsion reac-
tors, including the total energy and
power deliverable by the core, the vol-
ume of the reactor, the enrichment
level of the fuel, reactivity limits, and
the heat transfer area required for a
given power level.
It is complicated, but a 2016 report by
the JASON scientific advisory board
concluded that using an optimized LEU
design instead of the existing HEU de-
sign could result in a significantly
more compact core. This would be a
true operational advantage and one
that we should not give up by aban-
doning this R&D program that has
been going on for years.
I close by pointing out that I am not
alone in this. This is not only about op-
timizing submarine performance. As

H5624 July 11, 2019
pointed out by 35 Nobel Prize-winning
scientists, it is crucial for non-
proliferation that we set a good exam-
ple for the rest of the world and not use
weapons-grade uranium for applica-
tions where it is not required. Coun-
tries like France and others do not use
weapons-grade uranium in their sub-
marines and in carriers. We should set
an example and do likewise.
This R&D program will enable that
possibility by continuing it for the
next decade.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I rise today as the only PhD
Physicist in Congress. During my career I
have design and led the construction of giant
particle accelerators and other nuclear equip-
ment, led high-risk and successful R and D
programs, and designed equipment using
classified neutron transport codes.
Because of its importance to National Secu-
rity and Nuclear NonProliferation, I have stud-
ied at length the question of minimizing the
use of HEU in our naval propulsion reactors.
I received numerous individual and highly
technical classified briefings, examined reactor
core specifications, and visited the naval nu-
clear fuel fabrication facility in Virginia.
I believe that the research supported by this
amendment is worth pursuing, for the reasons
given by my colleague.
The reason is simple, that HEU is one of
the most dangerous substances known to
man, because it can be used to make a sim-
ple, gun-type design nuclear bomb with a
multi-kiloton yield.
This is not true of LEU—low-enriched, non-
weapons grade uranium.
This distinction is important for the enforce-
ment of Nuclear Nonproliferation. Since the
detection of even minute amounts of HEU can
and has been used as clear evidence of a
weapons program in a nation that has alleg-
edly committed to only peaceful uses of atom-
ic energy based on LEU.
Which is why the elimination of globally held
stockpiles has been a U.S. policy objective for
over 40 years, and recently supported by a
letter from 35 Nobel Prize winners.
But let’s talk about the physics and reactor
systems engineering.
Several factors must be dealt with in deter-
mining the practicality of utilizing LEU in naval
propulsion reactors, including total energy and
power deliverable by the core, volume of the
reactor, and enrichment level of the fuel, reac-
tivity limits, and the heat transfer area required
for a given power level.
A 2016 report by the JASON Scientific Advi-
sory Board concluded that, that using the ex-
isting HEU design, in order achieve the same
total deliverable energy using LEU, the core
would have to be approximately 4.5 times
larger.
This does not mean, however, that you
would need a reactor system with 4.5 times
the volume, since most propulsion compo-
nents scale with the power of the reactor,
which would be unchanged in the conversion
from HEU to LEU.
The purpose of the R and D funding in this
amendment is to develop and qualify a fuel
element and reactor design the will result in a
much more compact overall design.
Although the exact improvement factor is
classified and has been redacted in the public
version of the JASON report.
If the R and D program succeeds, it will
verify the feasibility of using LEU in Naval re-
actors with smaller or no performance com-
promise.
The independent JASON scientific review
committee gave this R and D program a posi-
tive outlook.
In a July 2016 report to Congress, the Of-
fice of Naval Reactors stated that, ‘‘The ad-
vanced LEU fuel system concept has the po-
tential to satisfy the energy requirements of an
aircraft carrier without affecting the number of
refuelings.’’
This would massively reduce U.S. consump-
tion of Weapons Grade Uranium.
The situation is more nuanced for sub-
marines.
The Virginia-class replacement propulsion
plant is being targeted by this R and D pro-
gram, with a decision time for transition to
LEU of about 10 years from now.
But such progress over the next two dec-
ades can only happen if we continue aggres-
sively pursuing the R and D now.
As the JASON report stated, ‘‘If a decision
is made soon to proceed with ELE–LEU de-
velopment, then by the time the design of the
Virginia-replacement propulsion plant is being
solidified in the 2030 time frame, NNPP will
have a good idea of whether ELE–LEU will
succeed. . . . [T]hen the Navy’s final HEU
core might be built as early as 2040.’’
If any of my colleagues would like to con-
tinue this conversation in a classified setting,
I would be more than happy to answer any
questions.
I urge my colleagues to join me and vote
yes on this critical amendment.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, in conclu-
sion, I want to point to the 2016 report
that assessed that additional refuelings
would increase Navy fleet operating
costs by several billion dollars a year.
Mr. Chair, as we are looking to re-
build the Navy, that means ships that
will not get built. That will mean less
operating capability. That will mean
ships that need to be at dock for longer
periods of time for maintenance and for
refueling.
A larger submarine reactor core,
which is what DOD says would be need-
ed for LEU, requires a larger sub-
marine, and it makes those submarines
less capable and less efficient.
It also requires massive redesigns, so
it interrupts existing submarine con-
struction programs.
All of those things have significant
impacts on the capability of the Navy.
Take the Virginia-class submarine
reactor, which operates on a 33-year
ship expectancy. That would cut that
by one-third, which means it would
have to come back and be refueled
again.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

Kerry announced, ‘‘In my judgment Daesh is

areas under its control, including Yezidis,
Christians, and Shia Muslims. Daesh is geno-
cidal by self-proclamation, by ideology, and
by actions—in what it says, what it believes,
and what it does. Daesh is also responsible
for crimes against humanity and ethnic
cleansing directed at these same groups and
in some cases also against Sunni Muslims,
Kurds, and other minorities.’’;
(3) these atrocities were undertaken with
the specific intent to bring about the eradi-
cation and displacement of Christians,
Yazidis, and other communities and the de-
struction of their cultural heritage, in viola-
tion of the United Nations Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide signed by the United States on De-
cember 11, 1948;
(4) in 2016, the House of Representatives
passed H. Con. Res. 75 expressing the sense of
the House of Representatives that the atroc-
ities perpetrated by ISIS against religious
and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria in-
clude war crimes, crimes against humanity,
and genocide;
(5) through joint efforts of the United
States and 79 allies and partners, ISIS has
been territorially defeated in Iraq and Syria;
(6) in July 2018, under the direction of Vice
President Pence, the Genocide Recovery and
Persecution Response Program partnered
with the Department of State, the United
States Agency for International Develop-
ment, and local faith and community leaders
to rapidly and directly deliver aid to per-
secuted communities, beginning with Iraq;
(7) Christians in Iraq once numbered over
1.5 million in 2003 and have dwindled to less
than 200,000 today;
(8) armed militia groups linked to Iran, op-
erating systematically in Sinjar and the
Nineveh Plains, have harassed and intimi-
dated religious and ethnic minorities there-
by destabilizing northern Iraq and pre-
venting local and indigenous minorities to
return to their homelands;
(9) Iraqi religious minorities have faced
challenges in integrating into the Iraqi Secu-
rity Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga;
(10) over 500 acres of productive agricul-
tural lands in eastern Ninevah Governate
have been burned in cases of arson in May
2019 alone, destroying significant wheat and
barley cultivation areas;
(11) these agricultural resources are crit-
ical to northern Iraq’s livelihood, especially
that of minority populations, and continued
crop arson prevents safe and prosperous re-
turn of minority populations as well as com-
plicates stabilization efforts; and
(12) facilitating the success of communities
in Sinjar and the Nineveh Plains requires a
commitment from international, Iraqi,
Kurdish, and local authorities, in partner-
ship with local faith leaders, to promote the
safety and security of all people, especially
religious and ethnic minorities.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) it should remain a policy priority of the
United States, working with international
partners, the Government of Iraq, the
Kurdistan Regional Government, and local
populations, to support the safe return of
displaced indigenous people of the Nineveh
Plain and Sinjar to their ancestral home-
land;
(2) it should be a policy priority of the
Government of Iraq, the Kurdish Regional
Government, the United States, and the
international community to guarantee the
restoration of fundamental human rights, in-
cluding property rights, to genocide victims,
and to see that ethnic and religious plu-
ralism survives in Iraq;
(3) Iraqi Security Forces and the Kurdish
Peshmerga should work to more fully inte-
grate all communities, including religious
minority communities, to counter current
and future terrorist threats; and
(4) the United States, working with inter-
national allies and partners, should continue
to lead coordination of efforts to provide for
the safe return and future security of reli-
gious minorities in the Nineveh Plain and
Sinjar.

(3) the Secretary of Defense should, to the
greatest extent possible, ensure United
States Northern Command and United
States Southern Command have the nec-
essary assets to support and increase
counter-drug activities within their respec-
tive areas of operations in the transit zone
and the Caribbean basin.

ARIZONA
Page 408, line 7, strike ‘‘and’’.
Page 408, line 10, strike the period at the
end and insert ‘‘; and’’.
Page 408, after line 10, insert the following
new subparagraph:
(C) ensure that the United States will
eliminate dependency on rare earth mate-
rials from China by fiscal year 2025.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. SMITH) and the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN-
BERRY) each will control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from California (Mr. SHERMAN).
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank
the chairman for including my amend-
ment in the en bloc. This amendment
is cosponsored by Chairwoman
WATERS.
Russia interfered in our election. To
date, our sanctions have been illusory.
A few individuals have been told they
can’t get visas to visit the United
States. They will never see Disneyland.
This amendment provides real, seri-
ous sanctions on the Russian state by
saying that no U.S. person can make
additional purchases of Russian sov-
ereign debt.
It provides a mechanism for remov-
ing these sanctions. If the administra-
tion concludes that Russia goes just
one election cycle without interfering
in our election, and if Congress agrees
with that conclusion, then these sanc-
tions are lifted.
Finally, the amendment narrowly de-
fines interference in our elections. It
makes it plain that if Russian tele-
vision wants to editorialize or Putin
wants to put out a press release, that is
fine. Rather, it is interference in our
election where Russia interferes with
voter tabulation or voter registration
processes, where Russia steals informa-
tion for the purpose of influencing our
election, or where Russian hackers use
false flag communications pretending
to be American spokesmen when they
are not.
We need a serious mechanism to pun-
ish Russia for what they did in prior
elections and to deter them from inter-
fering in our future elections. This
amendment does that, and I am pleased
to include it in the en bloc.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.
FOXX).
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chair, I thank the gentleman from
Texas for yielding me time and includ-
ing my amendment in the en bloc.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the en
bloc package. I thank Chairman SMITH
and Ranking Member THORNBERRY for
their assistance on my amendment and
thank the Rules Committee for recog-
nizing the importance of this issue.
My amendment sends a clear signal
to the European Union on the impor-
tance of the primacy of NATO over our
shared defense interests.
As some European capitals push for
the formation of a European Union
army, my amendment expresses the
importance of NATO centrality over
our defense policy architecture and the
necessity of military system interoper-
ability and burden-sharing efforts
among NATO allies.
We all know that increases in Euro-
pean military capability must be made
by our European allies to comply with
their NATO obligations. Investments
underway in the form of the PESCO
pact and the European Defense Fund
can risk system interoperability and
present divergent spending priorities
within our alliance. EU defense invest-
ments should take place under the
NATO umbrella to ensure account-
ability and the guarantee of U.S. influ-
ence.
Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues
again for their support of this amend-
ment.
b 1615
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.
JAYAPAL), my fellow Washingtonian.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, I thank
the chairman for his leadership on this
package.
My amendment in this package
would help curb the corrupt influence
of foreign money in our politics.
The Emoluments Clause of the Con-
stitution already requires retired mili-
tary officers who want to work for a
foreign government to first receive per-
mission from their service in the State
Department and to disclose the nature
of their work. My amendment would
make the approved activities available
to Congress and to the public.
We still have a long way to go to con-
strain foreign influence peddling and
corruption in Washington. We saw this
with General Flynn, who concealed his
work lobbying for the Turkish Govern-
ment in a dispute with the United
States in the 2016 Presidential election.
We trust our retired military offi-
cials to speak in the best interest of
the United States, and when they are
being paid to further another country’s
agenda, we deserve to know.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment package.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss
GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN).
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking
Member THORNBERRY and Chairman
SMITH for including my three amend-
ments, amendments No. 162, 163, and
164, in this en bloc package.
Amendment 162 requires the Depart-
ment of Defense to review the effects
on preparedness and support to States
and territories in connection with nat-
ural disasters, threats, and emer-
gencies prior to inactivating Army
watercraft units.
There are four of these vessels in
Puerto Rico. They were instrumental
during the recovery process after Hur-
ricane Maria and conducted several re-
covery missions, including delivering
food and other essentials to island mu-
nicipalities and the Virgin Islands.
This role should be taken into ac-
count as part of the review process
prior to divesting any of the Army’s
watercraft systems, especially consid-
ering the multiple jurisdictions that
have been recently impacted by nat-
ural disasters.
Amendment No. 163 seeks to help us
speed up the Federal cleanup and de-
contamination process in the former
military ranges on the island munici-
palities of Vieques and Culebra. Spe-
cifically, my amendment directs the
General Accounting Office to complete
a study and a report to the congres-
sional defense committees on the sta-
tus of the process, including an anal-
ysis of the pace of ongoing environ-
mental restoration efforts and poten-
tial challenges and alternatives to ac-
celerate their completion. This com-
prehensive study will allow us to ex-
plore the most effective and secure
methods to complete the cleanup proc-
ess in Vieques and Culebra, which is
vital to improve the quality of life of
island residents.
The last amendment, amendment No.
164, highlights the importance of the
Department of Defense counter-drug
operations in the transit zone and Car-
ibbean basin. It expresses the sense of
Congress that combating transnational
organizations in the region, particu-
larly in and around Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands, is critical to
national security of the United States,
and that the Department of Defense
shall work with the Department of
Homeland Security and the Depart-
ment of State and other relevant part-
ners to improve surveillance capabili-
ties and maximize the effectiveness of
counter-drug operations in the region.
That is the reason I strongly urge my
colleagues to support this effort, and I
thank you for including these three
amendments in the en bloc package.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from California (Mrs.
TORRES).
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Chair, for 171⁄2 years, I worked as a 911
dispatcher.
My average day consisted of handling
incidents, such as coordinating police
vehicle and foot pursuits, talking to
suicide callers, negotiating with barri-
caded suspects, and talking to their
victims.
One call that has stayed with me and
threw me into a political world that I
never wanted to be a part of, I an-
swered a call from a little girl who was

murdered at the hands of her uncle. I
was her only witness. I heard her
scream. I heard her head being bashed
against the wall. I heard the five shots
that ultimately took her life. Her last
words: ‘‘Uncle, please don’t kill me. It’s
not my fault.’’
This work requires a lot of training
and tough attitude to deal with critical
emergencies. Unfortunately, the Fed-
eral Government currently classifies
911 dispatchers as clerical workers—
secretaries. My amendment would fi-
nally recognize the critical work they
do by reclassifying them as protective
service occupations.
This provision costs nothing, zero,
but it would bring 911 professionals, ci-
vilian workers—primarily single
moms—the dignity that they deserve.
Mr. Chairman, I urge its passage.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
FITZPATRICK).
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chair, I
stand today in strong support of this
bipartisan amendment which includes
language from the 911 SAVES Act, H.R.
1629.
Public safety telecommunicators
play a pivotal role in coordinating ef-
fective responses to crises affecting our
communities. By directing the urgent
concerns of the public to law enforce-
ment officials, public safety tele-
communicators work to ensure emer-
gency services are delivered where
needed.
Today, there are nearly 100,000 public
safety telecommunicators serving in
over 6,000 call centers across the
United States. Their diligence, dedica-
tion to public well-being, and steady
demeanor in the presence of turmoil is
needed now more than ever.
I am proud to partner with my col-
league from California, a former 911
dispatcher herself, Mrs. TORRES, to en-
sure these dedicated public servants re-
ceive the ‘‘protective service occupa-
tions’’ classification from OMB which
they deserve. We owe this to those who
are often the first to respond to emer-
gencies in our communities each and
every day.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA).
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chair, I rise in
strong support of the Torres amend-
ment, No. 658, which recognizes the
lifesaving work performed by our Na-
tion’s 911 call takers and dispatchers.
Mr. Chairman, all of the emergency
activities in my own district—the po-
lice, the fire, the emergency respond-
ers—strongly support this amendment,
and so I want to stand with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle sim-
ply stating these professionals save
lives. And more than giving 911 call
takers and dispatchers the recognition
they deserve, it would make the stand-
ard occupational classification system
more accurate and, therefore, more
useful as a statistical resource.
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I thank the
gentleman for yielding me the time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITT-
MAN).
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I
would like to refer to my amendment,
No. 403, involving the Cable Ship Pro-
gram.
I know that there have been some
issues pointed out concerning coastal
commerce, and I look forward to work-
ing through those issues as the bill
gets to conference.
Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my
time to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. COURTNEY).
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, again, I
just want to join my colleague from
Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN), and I look for-
ward to working with him in the con-
ference committee to make sure that
that question is resolved.
Both of us understand the issue and,
again, I look forward to a satisfactory
result, which would make the real gist
of the amendment move forward, which
is to make sure we have cable ship ca-
pacity to protect our Nation.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I don’t have any more speakers, so I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FOR-
TENBERRY).
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
want to thank Congressman THORN-
BERRY for the time as well as his lead-
ership, as well as the chair of the
Armed Services Committee, because
this is very important.
Recently, I was looking at the photos
of the young men and women who hang
on the wall of my office. They died in
Iraq—some of them I knew; some of the
families I knew, some I didn’t know;
some I still stay in touch with.
At this point, we have lost so much,
we have given so much, it is hard to
understand why further engagement is
necessary. And yet, of the many injus-
tices that remain, one, particularly,
stands out.
The dark twisted idealogy of ISIS
decimated the religious minority com-
munities, primarily of northern Iraq,
almost 4 million persons. ISIS at-
tempted to exterminate, to kill off
Yazidis, Christians, and other minority
populations.
Now, since then, the Iraqi Army,
with our support and with the support
of an international coalition, has
fought hard and fought ISIS off. They
are gone but not yet exterminated.
We have shifted substantial economic
aid, but there is one more thing we
should do: provide security in northern
Iraq through the integration of the re-
ligious minorities into the Iraqi Gov-
ernment security forces, as well as the
Kurdish forces.
I thank both the chair and the rank-
ing member for their support.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I have no further speakers, so I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
have no further speakers, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I urge support of the en bloc package,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in opposition to Amendment No. 47,
which directs the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) to reclassify public safety tele-
communications officers, also called 911 dis-
patchers, as a protective service occupation in
the U.S. Government’s Standard Occupational
Classification (SOC) system. This Amendment
would have no direct effect on these workers’
wages, benefits, or other resources; pro-
ponents of this reclassification have stated
that ‘‘the benefit of reclassification is recogni-
tion and respect.’’
The SOC classification system is a federal
statistical standard used across agencies in
data collection. According to OMB, ‘‘[t]he SOC
is designed exclusively for statistical pur-
poses.’’ Changes to the codes affect multiple
data sources frequently used by policymakers,
researchers, and employers, including the
American Community Survey, the nation’s
largest household survey; the Current Popu-
lation Survey (CPS), the key source of our
monthly employment numbers; and the Occu-
pational Employment Statistics (OES), the au-
thoritative source of employment and wage in-
formation by occupation.
A standing committee at OMB, the SOC
Policy Committee (SOCPC), is responsible
maintaining the accuracy of these codes using
well-defined principles. The SOCPC under-
takes a routine revision of the codes roughly
once per decade; the process spans multiple
years and ‘‘involves extensive background re-
search, periods of public comment, review of
comments, and implementation of revisions.’’
During its latest revision, which began in early
2012 and was finalized in 2018, OMB specifi-
cally rejected comments requesting it reclas-
sify 911 dispatchers as directed in Amend-
ment No. 47. In its response to public com-
ments presented in the May 2014 Federal
Register, the Obama Administration’s OMB
explained it ‘‘did not accept these rec-
ommendations based on Classification Prin-
ciple 2, which states that workers are coded
according to the work performed. The work
performed is that of a dispatcher, not a first re-
sponder.’’ In 2016, the previous administra-
tion’s OMB declined a similar request for re-
classification. Based on the principles OMB’s
policy committee applies to determine SOC
codes, 911 telephone dispatchers are already
properly and accurately classified.
Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS), in a written communication with the
Education and Labor Committee on April 26,
2019, reported that the change made by H.R.
1629, a bill identical to Amendment No. 47,
would ‘‘impact computer systems, training,
documentation, and other processes’’ and that
‘‘[s]uch unplanned changes require time and
resources to implement and could adversely
affect other survey activities.’’ Moreover,
changes outside of the routine revision proc-
ess would undermine the goal of data con-
tinuity, limiting data sources’ usefulness for
their key purpose of statistical analysis; create
precedent for disrupting the standard SOC re-
vision process; and undermine the SOCPC’s
authority as experts to apply the classification
principles to determine what accuracy re-
quires.

July 11, 2019
Public safety telecommunications officers
perform critical, challenging work. They de-
serve our honor and gratitude for their efforts.
However, considering the many alternative
ways policymakers could confer ‘‘recognition
and respect,’’ as the proponents are seeking,
there is little policy justification for this Amend-
ment’s approach to achieving that goal. In
conclusion, mandating a change to a statistical
code would not affect these workers’ wages,
benefits, or other resources—but it would dis-
rupt data series continuity; require significant
additional work for government agencies, re-
searchers, employers, and others; and inter-
vene in an official, routine government data-
collection and statistical process.
COMMUNICATIONS OF APRIL 26, 2019 FROM THE
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS TO THE COM-
MITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR REGARD-
ING H.R. 1629 (SAME AS AMENDMENT NO. 47)
QUESTIONS RELATED TO H.R. 1629
1. How will H.R. 1629 impact the current
population survey and occupational employ-
ment statistics?
2. H.R. 1629 would require the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) to imple-
ment a change in the Standard Occupational
Classification (SOC) system regarding public
safety telecommunicators. This requirement
would alter the existing process for periodi-
cally reviewing and updating the SOC, which
involves extensive background research, pe-
riods of public comment, review of com-
ments, and implementation of revisions.
Federal statistical agencies, including the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are cur-
rently in various stages of implementing the
2018 revisions to the SOC (https://
www.bls.gov/soc/socimp.htm), which the Of-
fice of Management and Budget released in a
November 28, 2017 Federal Register notice
(https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc2018final.pdf).
In particular, the Current Population Survey
(CPS) and the Occupational Employment
Statistics (OES) program are actively using
the 2018 SOC and any changes to the SOC
structure would impact computer systems,
training, and documentation as well as the
systems of federal and other data users
downstream, such as the BLS Employment
Projections (EP) program and the Employ-
ment and Training Administration’s Occupa-
tional Information Network (O*NET).
The CPS is a monthly survey with a sam-
ple of 60,000 households. CPS occupational
and industry data are coded according to the
most detailed level of the relevant classifica-
tion system possible, accounting for factors
such as disclosure concerns for small occupa-
tions and the ability to code occupations
based on the detail provided by household re-
spondents. This CPS occupational coding
system closely aligns with the SOC, but pro-
vides data on about 530 occupations, com-
pared with 820 in the full SOC. The Census
Bureau is responsible for applying occupa-
tional codes. An overview of how they are
implementing the 2018 SOC is outlined here
https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/
library/working-papers/2019/demo/
sehsdwp2019-19.pdf. Therefore, there is no
guarantee that even if this change were to
occur, the Census Bureau would code at that
level of detail.
The OES program could make the needed
changes. The data would show changes in the
employment and wages for major groups af-
fected by the change in classification.
2. Will this bill have an impact on wage
class service contracts?
BLS is not involved in wage setting for
service contracts. To the extent that any
published BLS data are used in such wage
setting, any changes to those data could im-
pact wages.
3. Will implementing H.R. 1629 be difficult
for the BLS to do?
BLS uses the SOC in several surveys. Any
changes to the SOC structure would impact
computer systems, training, documentation,
and other processes. Such unplanned changes
require time and resources to implement and
could adversely affect other survey activi-
ties.
4. Are there plans for a revision of occupa-
tional classifications?
The SOC is revised periodically, with the
interagency SOC Policy Committee making
recommendations to OMB for changes. OMB
has not officially stated when the next SOC
revision will occur, although some indica-
tions are that the next SOC will be for the
year 2028. If they follow past practices, OMB
is likely to publish an initial Federal Reg-
ister notice soliciting public comment
around 2024. Detailed information on the re-
vision process for 2018 is made available here,
including a document called ‘‘Revising the
Standard Occupational Classification’’ which
provided detailed history on the revision
process and guidance on submission of sug-
gestions for changes for the 2018 SOC revi-
sion.
5. What other consequences are there if
H.R. 1629 is implemented?
Implementation of H.R. 1629 would alter
the existing process for periodically review-
ing and updating the SOC, which involves ex-
tensive background research, periods of pub-
lic comment, review of comments, and im-
plementation of revisions.
The revision process includes solicitations
of public comment in the form of Federal
Register notices. During the lengthy and
comprehensive SOC revision process, the
SOC Policy Committee establishes inter-
agency workgroups charged with reviewing
comments received in response to Federal
Register notices and providing recommenda-
tions to the SOC Policy Committee. Guided
by the SOC classification principles and cod-
ing guidelines, the SOC Policy Committee
reviews the recommendations from the
workgroups and reaches decisions by con-
sensus. This work process is established to
ensure that the review is conducted in align-
ment with the 2018 SOC classification prin-
ciples and coding guidelines, which are avail-
able starting on page 10 of the 2018 SOC User
Guide (https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/
soc_2018_user_guide.pdf).
In response to the May 22, 2014, Federal
Register notice, the SOC Policy Committee
received and reviewed six comments regard-
ing 9–1–1 dispatchers. These dockets were re-
viewed simultaneously by the SOC Policy
Committee and grouped under docket 1–0199
Dispatchers, Public Safety Telecommunica-
tors. The full SOC Policy Committee re-
sponse to docket 1–0199 is available at:
https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/
soc_responses_May_2014.htm.
In response to the July 22, 2016, Federal
Register notice, the SOC Policy Committee
received and reviewed over 4,000 comments
regarding 9–1–1 dispatchers. The full list of
comments is available here. For comments
related only to 9–1–1 dispatchers, filter the
subject column for ‘‘Police, Fire, and Ambu-
lance Dispatchers.’’ The Office of Manage-
ment and Budget (OMB) makes public com-
ments available from https://
www.regulations.gov/document?D=OMB-2016-
0006-0001.
During the revision process for 2018, a guid-
ing classification principle was added to em-
phasize the importance of maintaining time
series continuity, to the maximum extent
possible. Modifications to the structure in
intervening years may be inconsistent with
this principle.

The en bloc amendments were agreed
to.
AMENDMENT NO. 39 OFFERED BY MR. TAKANO
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 39 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 733, insert after line 15 the following:
SEC. 1092. PAROLE IN PLACE FOR MEMBERS OF
THE ARMED FORCES.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Any alien who is a mem-
ber of the Armed Forces and each spouse,
widow, widower, parent, son, or daughter of
that alien shall be eligible for parole in place
under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) parole in place reinforces family unity;
(2) disruption to servicemembers must be
minimized, in order to faithfully execute
their objectives;
(3) separation of military families must be
prevented;
(4) military readiness must be the supreme
objective;
(5) servicemembers are given peace of
mind, relived of the stressful burden wor-
rying about their loved ones; and
(6) Congress reaffirms parole in place au-
thority for the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from California (Mr. TAKANO) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise today
in support of my amendment that
would preserve parole in place for the
loved ones of our Active-Duty service-
members.
Parole in place allows military fam-
ily members who have come to the
United States illegally and are unable
to adjust their immigration status to
temporarily remain in the country.
My amendment would preserve the
parole in place program and reaffirm
the DHS Secretary’s authority to keep
families together and to minimize dis-
ruption to our servicemembers through
this vital program.
Now, under parole in place, a service-
member and their prospective spouse,
widow, widower, parent, son, or daugh-
ter is eligible for temporary protection
under the Immigration and Nationality
Act. This program is imperative to en-
suring our troops are free of the burden
that their loved ones will be subjected
to deportation while they dutifully
serve our Nation.
The current administration is inter-
ested in scaling back the program, fur-
ther waging a war against immigrants.
Ending parole in place would be detri-
mental to the troops and the fabric of
our Nation.
Regardless of military branch, all
servicemembers should be granted

peace of mind that their families are
safe at home while they risk their lives
abroad.
Deployments are tough enough on
our military families to endure,
conflated with the looming shadow of
deportation, the emotional toll is sim-
ply unbearable. Our troops must be
consistently prepared and focused on
protecting our freedoms. The least we
can do is to protect their families.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Chairman, this is an attempt to
codify a 2013 USCIS memo establishing
parole in place for unlawful aliens,
spouses, children, and parents of Ac-
tive-Duty forces.
While I support the underlying ra-
tionale behind this amendment and
also that policy, I cannot support this
because it is too vague, broad, and am-
biguous, and it does not accomplish the
purpose for which it is intended. The
purpose is to protect those service-
members.
Mr. Chairman, I will tell you what
this does is we don’t even ask the serv-
icemember if they want that person
here. So if the person is a victim of do-
mestic violence, escaping a spouse who
is following them, there is no provision
to even ask the spouse: Do you want
this person to be living close to you
that you are trying to escape?
It does not take into account any un-
derlying crimes that that person may
or may not have committed. Whether
it is domestic violence, sexual battery,
it puts the other servicemembers at
risk when we don’t.
Mr. Chairman, specifically, the
memo provided that these relatives or
anyone who has ever served in the U.S.
Armed Forces for any period of time,
with or without regard to whether the
discharge was honorable or dishonor-
able, is eligible to receive parole on a
categorical basis.
Mr. Chairman, we can’t honor folks
who have been dishonorably dis-
charged. We are not honoring the rest
of our soldiers when we honor just any-
one.
b 1630
In a 2013 meeting with the Obama ad-
ministration, USCIS admitted that the
servicemember is never contacted to
determine whether he or she wants the
unlawful aliens to receive parole in
place.
It admitted there is no process in
place to verify that the servicemember
actually served in the Armed Forces.
The USCIS admitted that parole in
place could be granted even if the serv-
icemember was dishonorably dis-
charged.
It admitted that the servicemember
could have felony convictions and his
or her immediate relatives would still
be eligible for parole in place.
These felony convictions could be for
domestic violence, sexual assault, all
the things that we have come to de-
spise and are trying to stamp out in
our Armed Forces.
USCIS admitted that, even in cases
of divorce, a servicemember’s ex-spouse
could be eligible for parole in place,
and it admitted that unlawful alien rel-
atives could still receive parole in
place despite a past criminal record.
This amendment does not fix any of
those issues and could allow a relative,
even if estranged from a servicemem-
ber, to be granted parole.
Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to op-
pose this amendment, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I wish to re-
spond to a couple of points that my
colleague has tried to make.
I want to stress that eligibility for
this program does not mean finality.
The Secretary of Homeland Security
still retains final authority over
whether parole in place will be granted.
This is a program that is adminis-
tered on a case-by-case basis and not
categorically. This program has been
in place for 9 years.
I appreciate that my colleague has
said that he agrees with the underlying
policy. The underlying policy is that
we want to give peace of mind to the
men and women of our military who
are laying their lives on the line for
our country while their undocumented
relatives at home may be under threat
of deportation.
We want to give them the peace of
mind that their families could stay,
with the final decision, on a case-by-
case basis, being made by the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security. Nothing
is categorically mandated in my
amendment.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Chair-
man, I continue to oppose. Like I said,
it is overly vague and broad. With the
right words added to this, this could be
something that works and that is help-
ful. But, in its current form, I can’t
support it.
Mr. Chair, I continue to ask my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
I have no further speakers, so when
the gentleman is ready to close, I am
ready to close.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I have no
further speakers, and I am prepared to
close as well.
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank Mr. TAKANO, my friend
from California, for entering this
amendment.
Mr. Chair, I do continue to oppose
this amendment. But with that I just
ask that he look at making it a little
more finite and making it a little less
vague, and with that I could support
this amendment.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, let me
just say that I believe that I have an-
swered the main concerns of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi.
As I said, nothing in this amendment
categorically says that eligibility
means finality in terms of who is fi-
nally adjudicated to actually remain
on a temporary basis, under temporary
protected status.
What this amendment does is what
the gentleman has agreed to is the un-
derlying policy, which is a humane pol-
icy, which is a policy that furthers the
national interests of our country in as-
suring the peace of mind of our mili-
tary servicemembers who have family
members in our country who are un-
documented.
I don’t think any American would be-
grudge someone who is putting their
life on the line having the peace of
mind that their family members are in
this country under temporary pro-
tected status and that they are judged
to have that status by the Secretary of
Homeland Security on a case-by-case
basis and that the Secretary remains
in full control of the final decision.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from California (Mr. TAKANO).
The amendment was agreed to.

waiver to the limitation under subsection (a)
for costs incurred with respect to the prop-
erties listed above if the president reim-
burses the Department of the Treasury for
the amount of the cost associated with the
expense.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from California (Mr. TED LIEU) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, the President ran for office on a
promise of draining the swamp. He, in
fact, personally has done exactly the
opposite.
My amendment is very simple. It
simply prevents the President from
profiting off of his own trips to his own
properties.
As you can imagine, when the Presi-
dent travels, he brings a large staff
with him—for security, for press, for
logistics, for other reasons—and then
the American taxpayer ends up paying
for the meals and lodging expenses of
everyone associated with that trip.
Up to this date, President Trump has
spent 270 days at properties that he
owns. Every time he does that, he or
his family profits. That includes 99
days at Mar-a-Lago, 21 days at Trump
International Hotel in D.C., 74 at
Trump National Hotel Bedminster, and
59 days at Trump National Hotel Poto-
mac.
The General Accounting Office re-
ports that the President spends an av-
erage of 3.4 million in taxpayer dollars
every time he travels just to Mar-a-
Lago.
Not content to profit from the Amer-
ican taxpayer, the President has also,
in fact, raised prices at his properties,
at Mar-a-Lago and at Trump Inter-
national Hotel in D.C. So, now, tax-
payers are paying even more for lodg-
ing expenses associated with his staff.
My amendment limits the use of De-
partment of Defense funds at Trump-
owned properties, and it also includes a
waiver where the President can still
stay at these properties; he just has to
reimburse the Treasury for the amount
that the taxpayer is paying for his staff
to stay there.
Mr. Chair, with that, I respectfully
request an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. Members are re-
minded to refrain from engaging in
personalities toward the President.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
We have had this discussion on
emoluments, and I hope that my col-
league saw the newspaper today. Here
is the newspaper, The Washington
Times, front page: ‘‘Court rejects law-
suit over Trump business. Maryland,
D.C. slammed down.’’
So, the Fourth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals has said one of the lawsuits out
there is baseless.
But there is actually more going on
here. This is kind of an embarrassing
amendment. I am sorry that we are
even debating this. This is a blatantly
political amendment.
We are supposed to be here talking
about providing the equipment and the
training for our men and women in uni-
form, so they can preserve and save
and keep our country secure, and this
is just an attempt to embarrass the
President.
It is a political amendment. It is
really not worthy of discussion in the
National Defense Authorization Act,
and I don’t think we should be wasting
our time on this. It is really not wor-
thy of the American people either.
Let me give an example on how silly
and how ridiculous this amendment is.
According to the language of this
amendment, if the President goes to
one of these properties and stays, like
Mar-a-Lago down in Florida, I guess he
could have Secret Service. They are
not paid out of DOD dollars. They are
paid out of Homeland Security dollars.
But he couldn’t take the people with
him who carry the nuclear football or
the communications people who keep
him in touch with the command and
control of our nuclear enterprise if,
God forbid, there was some kind of cri-
sis or emergency.
This has not been thought out. It is
totally ridiculous. Who would want to
put a President of the United States
through that kind of jumping through
hoops and obstacles to fulfill his duties
as Commander in Chief?
I think it is ridiculous. It is not wor-
thy of us.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, the gentleman across the aisle
has mischaracterized this amendment.
All of his staff can still travel with
him. The President just has to reim-
burse the cost if it is at his own prop-
erty, or he can choose to stay at a Ritz
Carlton or a Holiday Inn or any other
commercial property that he does not
own.
Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
RASKIN).
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chair, ridiculous,
ludicrous, absurd, all of this, right?
Well, I guess the Constitution is ab-
surd because the Founders of the Con-
stitution took pains to build not one
but two Emoluments Clauses right into
the text of the Constitution.
Article I, section 9, clause 8 says that
no one who comes to work in this
room, nor the President of the United
States, can collect any present emolu-
ment—which means any payment—of-
fice or title of any kind whatever—the
most absolute, categorical language
you will find in the Constitution—of
any kind whatever from a foreign
prince, king, or government, without
the consent of Congress.
That is number one.
Then, number two, in the domestic
Emoluments Clause, the Founders
wrote in that the President was limited
to his salary, which could be neither
increased nor decreased by this.
My friend is waving the newspaper,
and I can’t wait to get to refute his
point. He is going to have to read a lit-
tle more deeply into judicial opinions
if he is going to cite them on the floor
of the House of Representatives, be-
cause this decision was simply that
Maryland and the District of Columbia,
whose attorneys general came forward
to say that the President’s receipt of
emoluments at the Trump Hotel was
damaging local business, did not have
standing; and the court said it is up to
Congress to decide this because they
didn’t have standing, as States, to hear
it.
It was not on the merits of the case,
if you go back and look. It was about
whether they had standing to bring it.
We have got the standing because the
Constitution of the United States says

that we are the ones whose consent is
required before the President can de-
cide to get rich in office.
The Founders wrote a Constitution
where the President and everybody in
this room is supposed to be 100 percent
loyal and faithful to the people of the
United States of America, not to for-
eign governments.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, I yield the gentleman from
Maryland an additional 30 seconds.
Mr. RASKIN. This President spent
270 days at Trump-owned properties.
Think about that for a second. What
if Barack Obama had not only taken
the press corps and the government
with him to Martha’s Vineyard, but
made everybody stay at the Obama
Hotel and he directed the government
to spend taxpayer moneys at the
Obama Hotel in Martha’s Vineyard?
There would be a revolution over on
that side of the aisle.
That is what is happening right here.
Every time that President Trump goes
to Mar-a-Lago, they are spending
$60,000, estimated by the GAO, every
weekend that they take government
resources down there. And we pay it.
It is wrong, and it is against the Con-
stitution.
Mr. Chair, I am totally in favor of
this amendment.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, how
much time is remaining on each side?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado has 3 minutes remain-
ing. The gentleman from California has
11⁄4 minutes remaining.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I will
make one brief comment and then
yield the remainder of my time to the
gentleman from Ohio.
The President isn’t in this to get
rich. He has given up his salary.
Mr. Chair, with that, I would like to
yield the balance of my time to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS).
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, since the
beginning of this year, so much of our
time in this Chamber has been used to
move one messaging bill after another.
Many of these bills are thinly-veiled
attacks on the President, but this
amendment goes above and beyond.
Under this amendment, the Depart-
ment of Defense is prohibited from
staying at any property owned by
President Trump or his family.
To be clear, this is not a prohibition
on the Department of Defense utilizing
facilities owned by any President; this
amendment is about Donald Trump,
President Donald Trump. It explicitly
names the President over 50 times.
Fifty times in this amendment the
President is named.
This amendment says the DOD can’t
do for President Trump what it does
for every President in the past: facili-
tate Presidential travel.
This is a new low. In 2016, the GAO
found the Department of Defense spent
more than $2.8 million facilitating a 4-
day trip for President Obama, which
included a Florida vacation.
While the bulk of the Department of
Defense’s spending on Presidential
travel is airfare, the Federal employees
who are staffing the trip need to eat
and sleep.
When you travel with President
Obama, you can eat and sleep wherever
is most convenient and most cost-effec-
tive, but when you travel with Presi-
dent Trump, you had better pack a
sandwich and a sleeping bag, because
you can’t buy a hot meal or reserve a
hotel room because everything is usu-
ally so full.
This is an unreasonable restriction
on the DOD and on this administration.
The focus on who owns the facility
instead of which facility meets the
needs and mission of the Department is
disgraceful.
A number of people travel with the
President and the Cabinet, and they
need the flexibility to choose the best
facilities. Placing unnecessary restric-
tions on these choices for political mo-
tivations impedes the Department’s
mission.
As was just stated by my colleague
from Colorado, this President donates
his presidential salary to charity.
And he doesn’t have time to worry
about what the Department of Defense
is doing because he is making America
better.
b 1645
We have the lowest unemployment in
decades. We have got wages going up.
We have got a strong economy.
He is working on trade deals. He is
fighting for every worker out there,
every farmer, every business; and I
don’t think he really has time; and it is
about time that the other side of the
aisle moves on and realizes who is the
President of the United States, and the
great things that are happening in this
country, and not doing such juvenile
tactics of restricting the Department
of Defense to where they can go; be-
cause this would also include an em-
ployee of the Department of Defense
not being able to use the expense ac-
count if something comes up.
He has got assets all around the
world. It might be more applicable to
be at a Trump facility. He has got
things in Istanbul, the Philippines, all
around the world, and you never know.
We shouldn’t tie the hands of the De-
partment of Defense. It is up to them
to make those decisions, and not for us
to put ridiculous restrictions on.
So I sincerely urge defeat of this
amendment for many of the reasons I
simply have said. In the standards of
this body, this is the lowest standard.
We have gone to a new low.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, Department of Defense employ-
ees should not be staying at high-
priced hotels.
I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. BEYER).
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I strong-
ly support my friend, Mr. LIEU’s
amendment.
The Constitution bans the very self-
dealing behavior that we are seeing
this President engage in on a regular
basis. President Trump illegally profits
every time he and his staff visits his
properties, every time he hosts foreign
and domestic officials, every time he
plays golf on his golf courses, all paid
for by the American taxpayers.
We are setting a dangerous precedent
while those seeking influence and favor
with the Trump administration merely
spend more time at his properties with
his name on them.
Let’s take a significant step to coun-
teract the self-dealing, corrupt behav-
ior, by banning taxpayer funds flowing
through the Department of Defense to
go into the President’s pockets.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, I yield the balance of my time to
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.
COHEN).
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, I just want to
add my support to this. We have added
these prohibitions on three other bills
that have come through here, State,
and Foreign Operations; Commerce,
Justice, and Science; and Financial
Services and General Government.
It is in the Constitution. Moneys are
not supposed to be spent there, and this
is wrong. The country will go on with
them staying at Hiltons or, as Mr. LIEU
said, Ritz Carltons, or Holiday Inns, or
even Red Roof Inns.
I just say that this is the right thing
to do, and I add my name as a sup-
porter.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Chair, I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. TED LIEU).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chair, I demand a re-
corded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from California will be
postponed.

units that perform customary ceremonial
duties, for review by the President in a pub-
lic or private exercise outside of authorized
military operations or activities.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to
offer an amendment that will save the
American taxpayers millions of dol-
lars, restore the appropriate focus of
the July Fourth holiday as a universal,
nonpartisan celebration of our Nation’s
independence, and ensure that tax-
payer money is spent for public, non-
partisan purposes, not private, per-
sonal, and partisan ones.
This amendment will ban military
parades and shows organized at the
personal request of the President that
serve no other governmental or mili-
tary purpose.
What happened this last Fourth of
July was a shameful, extravagant, and
profligate display of quasi-monarchical
pageantry which delighted the Presi-
dent and the political guests that he
brought in on special tickets, but no
one else.
This year’s July Fourth celebration,
at the President’s insistence, featured
seven flyovers of 24 different military
aircraft, including B–2s, F–22s, F–35s,
displays of ceremonial units, mobiliza-
tion of tanks and other military equip-
ment, all on the National Mall, an un-
precedented Presidential speech in
front of the Lincoln Memorial on the
Fourth of July, and hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars of fireworks that gen-
erated so much smoke that the fire-
works could barely be seen by the peo-
ple sitting on the Mall.
And all of that was inspired by the
President’s observation of a similar
military display when he was in Paris
for Bastille Day.
And guess who pays the price for all
this? The taxpayers do. That is right.
The National Park Service was forced
to divert $2.5 million in park fees to
help cover the costs for this event.
The Washington Post estimated that
the combined hourly rate of the seven
flyovers of military aircraft, the B–2
Stealth Bomber, the F–22 Raptors, and
the F–35 Lightnings, would have cost
at least $560,000 per hour. $560,000 per
hour.
The Defense Department said this
week that it used money from the mili-
tary services’ training budgets to pay
for these demonstrations ordered by
the President’s whim, and spent addi-
tional funds to transport the military
equipment, which shut down traffic in
Washington D.C. for most of the day.
Just yesterday, we learned the Dis-
trict of Columbia spent $1.7 million, an
amount that, combined with police ex-
penses for the demonstrations through
the weekend, has wiped out funding in-
tended to protect the Nation’s Capital.
And now the President is saying he
wants to do it all over again next year
on the Fourth of July, and into the
foreseeable future. We obviously can-
not allow that to happen.
This amendment will save all of our
money. It will depoliticize the Fourth
of July, and call us back to its original,
honorable purposes and the way we
have always celebrated; and it will
send a message to the executive branch
that the Federal Government serves
the people, not one person.
We have no kings here. We have no
queens. We have no monarchs. We have
no royal pageantry.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment.
I reserve the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. Members are re-
minded to refrain from engaging in
personalities toward the President.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Just like the last amendment, this is
not worthy of us as a body. We should
be here debating the National Defense
Authorization Act; how to equip and
train our men and women in uniform
so they can protect our country.
This is a blatant, cheap shot against
the President. It is just a political pot-
shot, and it is really not worthy of us
as a body.
This is a very poorly-written amend-
ment, on top of all that. I think we
would all agree, we shouldn’t have po-
litical displays by a Commander-in-
Chief, or anyone in the government, for
that matter, where public dollars are
involved.
But what about patriotic displays? Is
there anything wrong with that?
Let me give you a couple of examples
of things that would be prohibited by
this poorly-written amendment.
Every year, you have the Army,
Navy, and Air Force playing football
against each other for the Com-
mander’s Cup. And especially when the
Air Force and Navy play each other,
they have these flyovers. They each
have wonderful aviation capabilities,
and they will do a flyover of the sta-
dium, whether it is in Annapolis, or in
my district in Colorado Springs.
This is written so broadly, you
couldn’t have any kind of authorized—
any kind of—where’s the word—exhi-
bition. You could have no exhibition of
military arms.
So if the President was attending
that football game, you couldn’t have
the flyover. How silly is that?
Or if a President goes to a change of
command down at Fort Bragg, some-
thing like that, you couldn’t have the
military vehicles present there that
would be present normally at a change
of command.
Mr. Chairman, those are just a couple
of examples of how poorly written this
amendment is.
So I would say, let’s reject it. Let’s
get serious. Let’s get back to the busi-
ness of talking about what our men
and women in uniform need, and not
take these silly potshots against the
President.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chair, the hard-
working men and women of the Armed
Services certainly don’t need a bunch
of ceremonial pageantry paid for by the
taxpayers simply because the President
decides, upon a monarchical whim,
that he wants to see one outside in
front of the Lincoln Memorial.
The gentleman from Colorado says
that this is too broadly written. On the
contrary, it is very specifically writ-
ten. It would still permit ceremonial
displays of units that have been tradi-
tionally used at ceremonies and events,
such as the Presidential Salute Bat-
tery, the Old Guard, the Fife and Drum
Corps, Blue Angels, Thunderbirds, and
so on.
What it will not permit is the Presi-
dent himself calling up for a private or
public exercise outside of authorized
military operations or activities, these
kinds of exhibitions or parades.
So if it is traditional, if it is some-
thing that the Army and the Navy have
always done, if they think that there is
a legitimate governmental function for
it, yeah.
But the President cannot simply
snap his fingers and say I want to have
some kind of display of all the military
weaponry because that is what I saw
when I was on the Champs Elysees, and
I saw them on Bastille Day marching
down the street.
We know, and he has admitted pub-
licly, that this was the genesis of the
whole thing. He saw that, and he want-
ed that in America.
Well, guess what? That is not how we
celebrate the Fourth of July in Amer-
ica; and we certainly don’t do it with
Defense Department dollars, and we
certainly don’t do it with taxpayer dol-
lars.
If the President is so generous that
he gives his salary back, even though
he is collecting millions of dollars from
all of the government expenditures
down at the Trump Hotel and the
Trump golf courses, and all of the for-
eign governments that are spending
money over at the Trump Hotel—if he
is so generous, then why doesn’t he pay
for it himself?
The taxpayers should not have to pay
for such a ludicrous display of the
President’s own vanity.
I reserve the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. Members are
again reminded to refrain from engag-
ing in personalities toward the Presi-
dent.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, how
much time is remaining on each side?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado has 3 minutes remain-
ing. The gentleman from Maryland has
15 seconds remaining.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), who is a member
of the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5636 July 11, 2019
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, I
know my friend from Maryland to be a
very smart person.
But I also know, I was around when—
and I had a 4-year Army commitment—
when we went from draft to having all-
volunteer. And I said back at the time,
well, this means we are going to have
to spend a lot of money recruiting, en-
couraging people, advertising to get
people to join the military.
In recent years, there has been so
much anti-American sentiment, and
polls are showing that it has been ris-
ing, that that does have an effect on re-
cruiting.
I was out there, it was a fantastic—it
rained. That brought the temperature
down, but it was fantastic. And I have
already heard about two young people
who said, I saw that on television. I
was thinking about the military. I am
now not thinking about it; I am join-
ing.
Now, just so you know—let’s see, we
spend, between the Army Active Duty
and the Army Reserve, Army National
Guard, Air Force Active Duty, Air
Force Reserve, Air National Guard,
Navy Active Duty, Navy Reserve, Ma-
rine Corps Active Duty and Marine
Corps Reserve, actually $662 million in
2015, but only $574 million in 2017. So it
had been down from where it was in
2015. But this costs the military, it is
projected around $1.2 million.
I cannot imagine a more effective use
of that money for showing people what
they can be a part of if they join in the
defense of this country.
And, heck, when I was in the Army
for 4 years, we had displays, Congress-
men, Senators, they would show up,
and we would have a parade for them.
It seems kind of ridiculous to say we
hate this President so badly, any Mem-
ber of Congress, any Senator, you can
go have a parade for you, but not the
President. The President can’t call up
and say I am coming down; how about
a parade; because under the language
the gentleman has read, he can’t ask
for anything like that.
He is the Commander in Chief of all
of the military; and even in Washing-
ton’s day, it was a good thing for the
President to have a parade, to encour-
age people to build up American, pro-
American sentiment.
So it is not a bad thing, it is a good
thing. This was money well-spent. I
can’t imagine a better use of military
funding. And the Park Services Direc-
tor said, it was a boon for them. So it
was a good use, and I would encourage
a ‘‘no’’ vote on the amendment.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
b 1700
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
15 seconds to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. BEYER).
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I would
just like to add a personal perspective.
I was raised in Washington, D.C., and
I remember fondly my father and
mother packing the six kids in the sta-
tion wagon with the blankets, but it
was never a partisan affair. It was
about Democrats and Republicans and
families in our Nation.
I had hundreds and hundreds of my
constituents at the Lincoln Memorial
say that this was the most egregious
display of personal ego they have ever
seen.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Maryland will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 46 OFFERED BY MR. HUFFMAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 46 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle H of title X, insert
the following:
SEC. ll. LANDS TO BE TAKEN INTO TRUST AS
PART OF THE RESERVATION OF THE
LYTTON RANCHERIA.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) The Lytton Rancheria of California is a
federally recognized Indian tribe that lost its
homeland after its relationship to the United
States was unjustly and unlawfully termi-
nated in 1958. The Tribe was restored to Fed-
eral recognition in 1991, but the conditions of
its restoration have prevented it from re-
gaining a homeland on its original lands.
(2) Congress needs to take action to reverse
historic injustices that befell the Tribe and
that have prevented it from regaining a via-
ble homeland for its people.
(3) Prior to European contact there were as
many as 350,000 Indians living in what is now
the State of California. By the turn of the
19th century, that number had been reduced
to approximately 15,000 individuals, many of
them homeless and living in scattered bands
and communities.
(4) The Lytton Rancheria’s original home-
land was purchased by the United States in
1926 pursuant to congressional authority de-
signed to remedy the unique tragedy that be-
fell the Indians of California and provide
them with reservations called Rancherias to
be held in trust by the United States.
(5) After the Lytton Rancheria lands were
purchased by the United States, the Tribe
settled on the land and sustained itself for
several decades by farming and ranching.
(6) By the mid-1950s, Federal Indian policy
had shifted back towards a policy of termi-
nating the Federal relationship with Indian
tribes. In 1958, Congress enacted the
Rancheria Act of 1958 (72 Stat. 619), which
slated 41 Rancherias in California, including
the Lytton Rancheria, for termination after
certain conditions were met.
(7) On August 1, 1961, the Federal Govern-
ment terminated its relationship with the
Lytton Rancheria. This termination was ille-
gal because the conditions for termination
under the Rancheria Act had never been met.
After termination was implemented, the
Tribe lost its lands and was left without any
means of supporting itself.
(8) In 1987, the Tribe joined three other
tribes in a lawsuit against the United States
challenging the illegal termination of their
Rancherias. A Stipulated Judgment in the
case, Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of the
Sugar Bowl Rancheria v. United States, No. C–
86–3660 (N.D.Cal. March 22, 1991), restored the
Lytton Rancheria to its status as a federally
recognized Indian tribe.
(9) The Stipulated Judgment provides that
the Lytton Rancheria would have the ‘‘indi-
vidual and collective status and rights’’
which it had prior to its termination and ex-
pressly contemplated the acquisition of trust
lands for the Lytton Rancheria.
(10) The Stipulated Judgment contains pro-
visions, included at the request of the local
county governments and neighboring land-
owners, that prohibit the Lytton Rancheria
from exercising its full Federal rights on its
original homeland in the Alexander Valley.
(11) In 2000, approximately 9.5 acres of land
in San Pablo, California, was placed in trust
status for the Lytton Rancheria for eco-
nomic development purposes.
(12) The Tribe has since acquired, from
willing sellers at fair market value, property
in Sonoma County near the Tribe’s historic
Rancheria. This property, which the Tribe
holds in fee status, is suitable for a new
homeland for the Tribe.
(13) On a portion of the land to be taken
into trust, which portion totals approxi-
mately 124.12 acres, the Tribe plans to build
housing for its members and governmental
and community facilities.
(14) A portion of the land to be taken into
trust is being used for viniculture, and the
Tribe intends to develop more of the lands to
be taken into trust for viniculture. The
Tribe’s investment in the ongoing
viniculture operation has reinvigorated the
vineyards, which are producing high-quality
wines. The Tribe is operating its vineyards
on a sustainable basis and is working toward
certification of sustainability.
(15) No gaming shall be conducted on the
lands to be taken into trust by this section.
(16) No gaming shall be conducted on any
lands taken into trust on behalf of the Tribe
in Sonoma County after the date of the en-
actment of this Act.
(17) By directing that these lands be taken
into trust, the United States will ensure that
the Lytton Rancheria will finally have a per-
manently protected homeland on which the
Tribe can once again live communally and
plan for future generations. This action is
necessary to fully restore the Tribe to the
status it had before it was wrongfully termi-
nated in 1961.
(18) The Tribe and County of Sonoma have
entered into a Memorandum of Agreement as
amended in 2018 in which the County agrees
to the lands in the County being taken into
trust for the benefit of the Tribe in consider-
ation for commitments made by the Tribe.
(b) DEFINITIONS.—For the purpose of this
section, the following definitions apply:
(1) COUNTY.—The term ‘‘County’’ means
Sonoma County, California.
(2) SECRETARY.—The term ‘‘Secretary’’
means the Secretary of the Interior.
(3) TRIBE.—The term ‘‘Tribe’’ means the
Lytton Rancheria of California.
(c) LANDS TO BE TAKEN INTO TRUST.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The land owned by the
Tribe and generally depicted on the map ti-
tled ‘‘Lytton Fee Owned Property to be
Taken into Trust’’ and dated May 1, 2015, is
hereby taken into trust for the benefit of the
Tribe, subject to valid existing rights, con-
tracts, and management agreements related
to easements and rights-of-way.

(e) APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN LAW.—Not-
withstanding any other provision of law, the
Memorandum of Agreement entered into by
the Tribe and the County concerning taking
land in the County into trust for the benefit
of the Tribe, which was approved by the
County Board of Supervisors on March 10,

amendment thereto, is not subject to review
or approval of the Secretary in order to be
effective, including review or approval under
section 2103 of the Revised Statutes (25
U.S.C. 81).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment is simple. It reflects a bill
that passed the House earlier this year
in March by a vote of 404–21.
I first introduced this bill in the
114th Congress. It was heard by the
Natural Resources Committee, re-
ported out favorably by unanimous
consent. It was then reintroduced in
the next Congress by my colleague
Representative Jeff Denham, and it
passed the House by voice vote. Then it
was reported by the Senate Committee
on Indian Affairs in October of 2018.
The bill was reintroduced again by me
this Congress, and after passage in this
House, it once again was reported out
favorably from the Senate Committee
on Indian Affairs just a few weeks ago.
This amendment would take land
owned by the Lytton Rancheria in
Sonoma County in my district into
trust as part of the Tribe’s reservation
for purposes of housing and economic
development. It would permanently
prohibit using these lands for casino
gaming, and it would uphold a memo-
randum of understanding carefully ne-
gotiated between the Tribe and the
County of Sonoma. It reflects an ex-
haustive stakeholder outreach process,
extensive meetings, and negotiations
between the Tribe, Sonoma County,
and other local governments.
This productive relationship is illus-
trated by support from the Sonoma
County Board of Supervisors, who have
jurisdiction over the land in question,
and also the nearest local public serv-
ice agencies, including the Windsor
Fire Protection District and Windsor
Unified School District. Even Cali-
fornia Governor Gavin Newsom is in
support of this bill. In fact, there is no
elected official in the area that is im-
pacted by this bill who is on record op-
posed to the bill.
So I urge adoption of the amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I claim the time in opposition for the
process of what we are doing, not nec-
essarily the substance of the amend-
ment at hand.
Since this bill had first been heard in
our committee, there have been new
voices that have been raised by the
people of Windsor, California, which is
the town located adjacent to the unin-
corporated area of the county in which
this land transfer would take place.
These residents have repeatedly con-
tacted our committee asking that their
voices simply be heard.
Now, for whatever the reason was, we
asked the committee to have one more
hearing and allow these voices to actu-
ally be heard. For whatever reason, the
majority on our committee decided to
silence the voices and just ram this bill
through the committee. The reason I
and several others voted against it in
committee and on the floor was simply
because of the process that went
through here.
This, as has been mentioned, is not
necessarily a new amendment. It is a
bill, a bill that has passed this House
and is sitting over in the Senate.
It is certainly my hope that this does
not portend a future in which those
who make the agenda of the House con-
sider the fact that the Democratic
House will so incomparably and infre-
quently work with a Republican Senate
that we now need to take every bill
that has been passed in the House and
turn it into another amendment and
then attach it to the next big bill that
happens to go through this process.
Certainly, that is not what I think
would be the best way going forward.
Now, the last reason, the process for
which I do object, is simply this bill
does not belong on a National Defense
Authorization Act. There is no defense
nexus. This is transferring of lands
from one area to Native Americans.
Now, heaven knows, I have had all
sorts of land issues and wildlife issues
on the NDAA, but in each one of those
there was a nexus to a training range,
a military mission. There is no connec-
tion with this particular bill.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for his concerns.
I won’t relitigate the issue of wheth-
er the amendment is made in order.
That has been decided. That is why we
are here.
With respect to the gentleman’s con-
cerns about local individuals who may
have expressed opposition to the bill—
and again, there is no official opposi-
tion, no local government agency, no
local elected officials, but some indi-
viduals in the area have opposed the
bill—I would just note, in the 115th
Congress, when then-Chairman BISHOP
of the Natural Resources Committee
supported the bill passing out of his
committee and passing on the floor,
the committee report itself noted those
same individual voices of opposition.
I will quote: ‘‘Lastly, the committee
has received a relatively large number
of communications from the residents
of Windsor in opposition to the bill.’’
There is no new opposition to this
bill. It is the same individuals, and it is
the same folks who the chairman at
the time, himself, noted.
So I would submit, Mr. Chairman,
there is nothing new here. This bill has
previously won broad bipartisan sup-
port, including from my friend from
Utah, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment was culled out from the en
bloc amendments. I am still not en-
tirely clear why, but I think, to the ex-
tent that it deserves to be singled out
and culled out, it is because it is a
model for other land-to-trust bills that
we sometimes see in this body. Rarely
will you find a case where a Tribe nego-
tiated more exhaustively in good faith
and produced actual agreements with
local government neighbors to the
standard and to the level that we see in
this case.
This is a good piece of legislation
broadly supported by the elected offi-
cials in the area and, in many cases,
having already won the strong bipar-
tisan support from Members in both
the House and the United States Sen-
ate. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
however one wants to spin whatever
issue is here, had the Democratic ma-
jority on the committee scheduled an-
other hearing to allow those voices to
be heard, I wouldn’t have objected
then, nor would I have objected right
now.
The sad part is this is not necessarily
the best of proposals. The checkerboard
pattern that is created by this amend-
ment is something in other amend-
ments we have tried to do, to consoli-
date and get rid of checkerboard pat-
terns and not create checkerboard pat-
terns.
But here is, still, the bottom line:
This establishes a precedent—this is
not a precedent. We have done it be-
fore. But it establishes the wrong ap-
proach.
The National Defense Authorization
Act should be about military stuff and
about the defense of this Nation. This
is not even a tangible concept. This is
something that has nothing to do with
it. We do have a partisan Rules Com-
mittee that has decided to lure some
people with partisan amendments to be

put in here, but it has nothing to do
with the actual bill.
We are going through a whole lot of
amendments and taking a whole lot of
time on the floor. The amendments to
the NDAA should have something to do
with the NDAA and not just pulling
wandering bills that go all over the
place and deciding to shove it on it just
because there is a vehicle that happens
to be going through this body.
That is why I said I am not talking
about the substance of the bill—al-
though there are some questions; I
would have had my questions answered
had there been another hearing for the
new voices that want to be heard—but
it is the process that we are going
through. The process here is wrong.
The process the Rules Committee did
was wrong.
We should not be talking about these
kinds of issues and taking our time on
these kinds of issues on an NDAA bill.
So, as I said, my opposition is purely
on process, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

tleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN).

So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
AMENDMENT NO. 48 OFFERED BY MR. PAPPAS
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 48 printed in part
B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle B of title III insert
the following:
SEC. 3ll. PFAS DESIGNATION, EFFLUENT LIMI-
TATIONS, AND PRETREATMENT
STANDARDS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 30 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, the
Administrator of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency shall revise the list of toxic pol-
lutants described in paragraph (1) of section
307(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act (33 U.S.C. 1317(a)) to add per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances to such list, and
publish such revised list, without taking into
account the factors listed in such paragraph.
(b) EFFLUENT STANDARDS.—As soon as
practicable after the date on which the re-
vised list is published under subsection (a),
but not later than January 1, 2022, the Ad-
ministrator shall publish in the Federal Reg-
ister effluent standards under section
307(a)(2) of the Federal Water Pollution Con-
trol Act (33 U.S.C. 1317(a)(2)) for substances
added to the list of toxic pollutants pursuant
to subsection (a) of this section, in accord-
ance with sections 301(b)(2)(A) and 304(b)(2) of
such Act.
(c) PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.—Not later
than January 1, 2022, the Administrator shall
promulgate pretreatment standards for per-
and polyfluoroalkyl substances under section
307(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act (33 U.S.C. 1317(b)).
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 476, the gentleman from New
Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Hampshire.
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I offer this amendment on
behalf of all the children and families
across our Nation who have been im-
pacted by the harmful effects of PFAS
contamination.
As of August 2017, the Department of
Defense identified over 400 Active and
BRAC installations in the United
States where there ‘‘is a known or sus-
pected release of PFOS/PFOA.’’
The Environmental Working Group
estimates that 475 industrial facilities
may be discharging PFAS directly into
bodies of water, some of which are used
as a drinking water source. It also esti-
mates that more than 100 million
Americans may be drinking PFAS-
tainted water.
This should be concerning to all of us
because science has linked PFAS with
developmental delays for children and
serious health conditions, including
cancer, immune system disorders, and
thyroid problems.
To date, however, the EPA has yet to
act to set standards under the Clean
Water Act. That is why this amend-
ment is needed.
In my home district in New Hamp-
shire, we are grappling with this issue
in a number of communities. In the
town of Merrimack, industrial pollu-
tion from a manufacturer has contami-
nated drinking water that thousands
relied on. At Pease Air Force Base on
the seacoast, PFAS chemicals have
been used by the military for decades
and have been detected in the sur-
rounding environment as well as pri-
vate and municipal wells.
My constituents have become far too
familiar with the impacts of living in
communities where these toxic chemi-
cals are present. This is more than just
a matter of tests, data sets, and parts
per trillion in the abstract. The bur-
dens of these chemicals are carried by
real people. I hear their stories first-
hand.

role on the front lines of this fight and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5642 July 11, 2019
worked at Pease Air Force Base for al-
most 10 years. Her son was exposed to
PFAS prenatally and for 5 years while
attending preschool and kindergarten
by drinking water from an affected
well. He was sick often as a child, and
his mother has ongoing concerns about
his health and immune system stem-
ming from that early exposure. Not
only is her family dealing with these
physical impacts, they are dealing with
the uncertainty and lingering ques-
tions about the facts and difficulty
with testing and diagnosis, and they
are left to wonder if and when things
may get worse.
It is for reasons like this that I have
been committed to advocating for fam-
ilies like these in my district and why
I have joined the bipartisan PFAS task
force to help come up with solutions.
While there are countless questions
we must answer, due to the relentless
work of advocates, community leaders,
and concerned citizens, the all too per-
vasive issue of PFAS contamination
has been brought to light.
The dedicated work of family,
friends, and neighbors banding to-
gether to ask questions and demand
answers has been critical, but it is time
for much more than just that. It is
time for us in Congress to take long-
overdue action. It is time for us to
push for stronger standards, invest in
cleanup, and improve protections for
those who have suffered from the ef-
fects of contamination.
Today, with the support of my col-
leagues, we can do just that. This
amendment takes a critical step in
holding polluters accountable and es-
tablishing proactive limits for PFAS
discharge as we work to curtail con-
tamination and support families who
have been exposed.
By adding PFAS to the Clean Water
Act’s list of toxic pollutants and re-
quiring EPA to set standards for dis-
charges into our Nation’s waters, we
are providing the EPA with the addi-
tional tools it needs to tackle these
toxic chemicals.
There is nothing more important
than safeguarding the health and well-
being of our communities.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote for the adoption of this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Illi-
nois is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, if this
amendment were limited to the 18 per-
and polyfluorinated compounds that
EPA knows about and has rendered a
judgment on, we would be having a dif-
ferent debate. Formulations like PFOA
and PFOS, for example, have been
studied and have already been taken
out of commercial use.
But this amendment, like others we
will be debating, emotionally and po-
litically requires severe action on an
entire class of chemicals, maybe as
many as 5,000 substances. It does so
without due diligence and scientific in-
quiry.
Nobody denies that there are real
concerns and frustration in commu-
nities affected by PFAS contamina-
tion. My colleague has raised those
concerns, and we certainly want to
help those communities, especially
those that host our soldiers, sailors,
airmen, and marines. The use of fire-
fighting foam in those areas has caused
PFAS to enter into ditches and canals
and seep into groundwater formations.
But while we can and should take ac-
tion to limit or even prohibit uncon-
trolled releases of PFAS-containing
firefighting foam, we can’t lose sight of
why this foam is used in the first place.
If you or your loved one are on a nu-
clear submarine that is carrying nu-
clear weapons under the Arctic icecap
or involved in a fiery aircraft accident
on the runway, you want the best fire-
fighting foam available, not the second
best.
The concern of these communities
needs to be addressed, but this is not
what is happening in this process.
Many of the compounds targeted by
these amendments are parts of manu-
factured goods that when disposed of
are not soluble in water.
Let me highlight a couple that have
been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration to be inserted into the
human body as medical devices. Yes,
lifesaving PFAS-related chemicals
have been approved by the FDA. They
are in medical devices and have been
approved to be inserted into the body.
Mr. Chair, to the ranking member
and to the chairman, the reason for the
importance of going through regular
order in the committee process is be-
cause we understand the chemicals. We
deal with healthcare.
As far as lifesaving equipment, we
are going to go through a couple of
those. Many recognize what a stent is.
This stent is there to open up arteries,
and it saves lives and allows people to
live a normal lifestyle.
This is one that was brought into my
office a couple of weeks ago. Many
more children than we would ever
guess are born with holes in their
heart. It is tough, but modern medicine
and technology have allowed these
children to lead and live normal lives.
How? Well, there is a medical device
that is part of these 5,000 compounds of
the PFAS community that saves these
children’s lives and allows the heart to
repair itself, and they go on to live a
normal life.
b 1815
This is a National Defense Authoriza-
tion bill, not a healthcare bill, not a
chemical, science, EPA bill. So let’s
look at national defense.
Here is the F–16, with all the compo-
nents that have per- or poly-
fluorinated compounds as part of the
F–16 platform. Do we really want to es-
sentially ban all these parts that would
eventually go into some landfill, and
they are not soluble, and create a
Superfund situation for the landfill
into which they go?
We have heard a lot from municipal
landfills that are disposing of legal
nonsoluble items in regulated landfills.
Do we really want to place farm land
under the Superfund designation be-
cause a farmer used wastewater treat-
ment sludge as a fertilizer?
That is why we must do our due dili-
gence and go through regular order
through the committee of jurisdiction.
I serve as the ranking member on the
Committee on Environment and Cli-
mate Change. It is our duty to have
oversight over the USEPA; it is our
duty to protect our communities; and
it is our responsibility not to over-
react.
Chairman TONKO and I are actively
engaged on this issue. As I have raised
this, it is very complicated, but it is
not impossible.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to re-
ject these shortcuts and allow the com-
mittee process to work. That is the
only way we can hope to address PFAS
concerns without the significant unin-
tended consequences this and these
other amendments would create.
Please vote against the amendment.
Please allow bipartisan discussions to
continue.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Chair, to close, I
think it is critical that we give EPA
the ability to set standards that are
reasonable for PFAS that would pro-
tect public health.
In passing this amendment, we can
ensure that our government can meet
its most basic guaranty: that every-
one—servicemembers, their families,
and civilians, alike—can have con-
fidence that the water we drink, the
natural environment all around us, is
clean and safe. This amendment will
ensure EPA sets standards for these
toxic pollutants to protect public
health and the safety of all Americans.
It is beyond time for us and Congress
to act to take serious action on PFAS,
and I urge adoption of this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

from New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS).

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 476, the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman,
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the
Speaker of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman from California for yield-
ing and commend her for her extraor-
dinary leadership in having a purpose
and a mission to our national security.
Her leadership on having an authoriza-
tion for the use of military force has
been unsurpassed in the Congress, and I
thank her. I know she will have amend-
ments to that effect this legislation, as
well.
Mr. Chair, I want to salute so many
members of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, starting with Chairman SMITH,
for his relentless efforts to advance
this strong bipartisan defense author-
ization legislation which honors the
values of our country, strengthens our
security, and advances America’s lead-
ership in the world.
One week after our Nation celebrated
the birth of our democracy, the Demo-
cratic House is proudly honoring that
oath, the oath we take to support and
defend the Constitution and to protect
the American people. The Democratic
majority is bringing forth responsible
budgeting needed for safe, strong, and
smart defense.
This legislation keeps America
strong with vital action to improve the
economic security and well-being of
our servicemembers and families, in-
cluding a much-needed pay raise.
It keeps America safe with critical
steps to promote collaboration with
our allies, harden our defenses against
hostile foreign powers, and meet the
challenges of the future, including the
climate crisis, which is a national se-
curity issue.
And it keeps America smart by re-
affirming Congress’ constitutional
oversight responsibility over the Presi-
dent’s military actions, including by
prohibiting funding for the deployment
a new low-yield nuclear missile war-
heads.
We applaud Representative RO
KHANNA and the many bipartisan co-
sponsors for their amendment to pro-
hibit Federal funds from being used for
any military force against Iran with-
out congressional authorization.
As I rise to support the bill, I also
rise to support Mr. KHANNA’s amend-
ment.
The bill—getting back to the bill—
also is about family. It is about sur-
vivor benefits. It protects children at
the border who are facing an appalling
situation that is beyond the pale of civ-
ilized behavior.
I always say the same thing when
people ask me what are the three most
important issues facing the Congress. I
say the same thing: the children, the
children, the children.
This legislation prohibits Depart-
ment of Defense funds from being used
to House unaccompanied children forc-
ibly separated from their parents or
legal guardian by Customs and Border
Protection near the border or a port of
entry. And it creates oversight, requir-
ing DOD to submit a certification that
any housing provided to unaccom-
panied children meets Department of
Homeland Security standards, includ-
ing those provided in the Flores settle-
ment.
We must take every action we can at
every opportunity we find to end this
situation of the children and improve
the health, safety, and well-being of
the children in custody.
In coming weeks, we will advance
Congresswoman ESCOBAR’s legislation
to bring more accountability to the De-
partment of Homeland Security and
medical care standard legislation, led
by Congressman RUIZ, to ensure the
health and safety of children and/or
adults in custody.
We support our Members who have
led visits to the Border Patrol stations
to find the facts and who are leading
the battle cry of action on behalf of
America’s values about what we stand
for.
So I urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes’’ on this important legislation.
Keep America strong. It is about a pay
raise for our troops, survivor benefits,
about protecting our children, in addi-
tion to, again, helping us honor our
oath of office to protect and defend. I
urge a strong bipartisan vote for this
bill to uphold our values and strength-
en America.
Mr. Chair, I again thank the gentle-
woman for yielding.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself 2 minutes.
Mr. Chairman, we have had a number
of speakers over the course of the last
2 days talk about that this bill pro-
vides a pay raise. I just want to clarify
that it does not.
There is an existing formula which
provides the military a 3.1 percent pay
raise. If we do nothing, they still get a
3.1 percent pay raise.
Now, in the past, sometimes the
Obama administration, for example,
recommended a lower pay raise. Some-
times in Congress we have enacted a
higher pay raise than the formula
would require.
But the key point is 3.1 percent is
what the formula is. This bill does not
change that in any way. If the bill
passes, if it doesn’t pass, the pay raise
still goes in.
I think the Speaker just indicated
that she supported the amendment we
are discussing now. Let’s be clear. The
bill before us cuts $17 billion from the
President’s request. The amendment
before us cuts another $16 billion from
that.
So all the folks who have come here
and said it is not too much, it is not
too little, it is just right, they have to
vote against this amendment because
this cuts an additional $16 billion.
What is the effect of this $16 billion?
It decimates counterterrorism oper-
ations around the world. All of this cut
comes from operations and mainte-
nance within the OCO, the overseas
contingency account. That means we
do not do as much to fight terrorists
overseas.
It hurts our ability, as another exam-
ple, to train and help the Ukrainians
fight the aggression that is occurring
on their soil. Lots of people talk about
standing up to the Russians. This
amendment takes away the biggest fac-
tor in Ukraine that is helping push
back against the Russian-backed insur-
gents. It decimates support for the Af-
ghan security forces.
Whether you think Americans should
be there or not, we are trying to help
you. Afghans defend themselves. This
amendment takes that away.
Real consequences in the real world,
I think this amendment finally gets to
where the direction of this bill is head-
ed. Members should oppose it.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I
am pleased to offer this amendment
with Representatives KHANNA, DEFA-
ZIO, OMAR, and PRESSLEY.
What this amendment would do is
freeze fiscal year 2020 defense spending
in the NDAA to 2019 levels by reducing
the overseas contingency operations
account by $16.8 billion.
Now, by restoring defense spending
to the levels authorized in last year’s
NDAA, this increase would be even
more modest than the $700 billion top-
line figure publicly embraced by the
President just 9 months ago before he
reversed course and requested an out-
rageous $750 billion.
Mr. Chair, just last year, the Depart-
ment of Defense failed its first ever
agencywide audit, something that I
have long called for, along with my col-
league Representative BURGESS.
I want to thank Chairman SMITH for
including our bipartisan language on
audit readiness to ensure that the DOD
is acting to address waste, fraud, and
abuse at the Pentagon and ensure that
it has a plan in place so it can pass an
unqualified audit.
If the Department of Defense cannot
even keep track of its current funding,
it is truly outrageous that Congress
would reward the Pentagon with a
massive spending increase. This
amendment is simply about reining in
the bloated Pentagon budget.
At the minute-by-minute level,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5644 July 11, 2019
2019 NDAA enacted levels this amend-
ment seeks to cut funding to.
The $16.8 billion to the top-line fund-
ing level, what this amendment would
do would require the fund to fund 6.8
million Head Start slots for 1 year, 1.63
million veterans receiving VA medical
care for 1 year, and providing 7 million
low-income children healthcare for 1
year.
Acting White House Chief of Staff
Mick Mulvaney called OCO a slush
fund and a sham when he served in
Congress, and there is growing bipar-
tisan support urging Congress to sig-
nificantly cut OCO. That is why I urge
‘‘yes’’ on this critical amendment to
rein in our out-of-control defense
spending.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO),
my colleague.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding.
Can you say ‘‘slush fund’’? OCO is ba-
sically a slush fund.
The idea was, oh, we went to war—
more than a decade ago—and we
couldn’t anticipate the expenses, so
Congress passed an overseas contin-
gency account. It is not very well su-
pervised by Congress, and as you heard
earlier, the Pentagon can’t even ac-
count for the funds that go in there.
But now, here we are. We can cer-
tainly anticipate what is going on next
year and the year after with the Pen-
tagon. Why isn’t it going through the
regular process within the Pentagon
budget and with full scrutiny by the
United States Congress and, God for-
bid, maybe even auditable? Imagine
that.
The only agency of the Federal Gov-
ernment which is unable to pass an
audit is the Pentagon.
About a decade ago, I got an amend-
ment on the floor to require an audit,
but it got taken out in a conference
committee. What are they afraid of in
accounting for the dollars they get?
And this is the least accountable of all
the dollars they get.
This is a modest reduction, and it
would restore funding to the 2019 lev-
els. You should vote for this amend-
ment.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAM-
BORN).
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, if you
care about our warfighters who are in
theater tonight, this is the worst pos-
sible cut that we could give the Depart-
ment of Defense.
This says that overseas operations,
where they are actually in places like
Afghanistan or Syria or Iraq, we are
going to take the dollars they are
using to operate and stay safe and get
the job done, and we are whacking one-
third off of that budget. We are taking
a meat-cleaver approach, not a scalpel.
This is a meat-cleaver approach.
Besides the things that the chairman
mentioned that would be cut working
with allies, intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance would be cut, ISR.
b 1830
When our commanders have forces
going out on a patrol, those patrols
want overhead observation before
them, over them, behind them. That is
the kind of thing directly cut by this
amendment.
When the troops come back, and the
equipment has to be refurbished and
reset, that is cut by this amendment.
Mr. Chair, this is a very poorly
thought out amendment, and I would
urge everyone to vote ‘‘no.’’
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman,
this is a modest approach that would
ensure that Congress doesn’t reward
the Pentagon with even more money
after it failed its first agency-wide
audit last year.
Recent polling shows that a majority
of the public does not want defense
spending increased. Nearly three-quar-
ters of Americans would not support
more of their tax dollars going to the
Pentagon.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this critical amendment,
and we must move forward and at least
begin to control this out-of-control de-
fense spending and support this amend-
ment. I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote.
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. WALTZ).
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Chairman, this cut
to the Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations budget, to the operations and
maintenance account, is an attempt to
back us out of the war on terror.
We all want peace. We all want these
wars to go away, but that doesn’t mean
we can just wish them away, that we
can just cut an account by over a third
and wish these wars away like the
Obama administration tried to do in
Iraq.
The reality is we can either fight
these wars in places like Kabul and
Kandahar and Damascus and Baghdad,
or this problem, particularly the ter-
rorism problem, the extremism prob-
lem, will follow us home to places like
Kansas City, San Bernardino, Orlando,
New York, and others.
It is irresponsible, in the midst of a
war—and I remind my colleagues that
we are in the midst of a war—to tie the
Pentagon’s hands by cutting these
funds when we have special operators,
as we speak today, as we are debating
here today, in 72 countries, as we have
more American servicemembers de-
ployed overseas than the entire armies
of the United Kingdom, Australia, and
Canada combined, ensuring a liberal
world order that has ensured the great-
est period of prosperity since World
War II that the world has ever known.
Mr. Chair, this is an irresponsible
amendment. We can have this debate
over where we should be and how our
servicemembers should be deployed,
but to cut their funds in the middle of
the war on terror and try to back us
out of these wars because you disagree
with them is the height of irrespon-
sibility.
We have a moral obligation to our
servicemembers overseas. Mr. Chair, I
urge my colleagues to oppose this
amendment.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LEE).
The question was taken; and the
Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I
demand a recorded vote.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of
rule XVIII, further proceedings on the
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from California will be post-
poned.

in subsection (g), the disposition’’; and
(2) by adding at the end the following new
subsections:
‘‘(g) DISPOSITION OF PERSONS DETAINED IN
THE UNITED STATES.—
‘‘(1) PERSONS DETAINED PURSUANT TO THE
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE OR
THE FISCAL YEAR 2012 NATIONAL DEFENSE AU-
THORIZATION ACT.—In the case of a covered
person who is detained in the United States,
or a territory or possession of the United

‘‘any other person’’ and inserting ‘‘applies to
any person’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 476, the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. AMASH) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Michigan.
Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
The 2012 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act authorized the President to
order the indefinite detention of Amer-
ican citizens arrested on U.S. soil with-
out charge or trial.
The NDAA says that:
The Afghanistan AUMF, empowers the
President to detain any person who substan-
tially supported associated forces of terror-
ists.
‘‘Substantial support’’ and ‘‘associ-
ated forces’’ are not defined.
Who could this cover? An American
citizen living in Michigan makes a one-
time donation to a nonviolent humani-
tarian group. Years later, the group
commits hostile acts against an ally of
the U.S. Under the 2012 NDAA, if the
President determines the group was as-
sociated with terrorists, the President
is authorized to detain the donor in-
definitely and without charge or trial.
This compromise amendment guar-
antees that persons arrested on U.S.
soil under the Afghanistan AUMF or
the NDAA will be charged for their
wrongdoing and will receive a fair
trial. The government will be required
to tell people detained on U.S. soil the
allegations against them, and the gov-
ernment will have to make its case be-
fore a judge, just as the Constitution
requires.
President Obama pledged in signing
the 2012 NDAA that he ‘‘will not au-
thorize the indefinite military deten-
tion without trial of American citi-
zens,’’ saying that to do so ‘‘would
break with our most important tradi-
tions and values. . . . ’’
But, Americans’ constitutionally
protected rights should not depend on
Presidential promises or who is in
charge. A free country is defined by the
rule of law, not the government’s
whim.
Mr. Chair, with that, I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I have
no other speakers other than myself,
and I reserve the right to close.
Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of
the committee.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, this is an amendment that
Mr. AMASH, Ms. LEE, I, and others have
worked on in previous years. It is a
very simple principle.
Certainly, with the 9/11 attacks, with
the terrorism threat that we face, it is
very real, and we need to make sure
that our country is in a position to de-
fend ourselves against that.
But we also need to make sure that
we protect the thing that gives us our
greatest strength, and that is the rule
of law in our Constitution. This amend-
ment simply says you cannot use law
of war detention against people in the
United States of America.
Our Article III courts have worked
amazingly well throughout the history
of this country. Through many con-
flicts and many threats, they worked
very well to bring people to justice,
lock them up, and protect us.
In fact, there are hundreds of terror-
ists right now in U.S. prisons who were
prosecuted under Article III of the Con-
stitution.
Article III and the history of the Su-
preme Court and other courts that
have laid out the laws that give us the
basic protections are essential to our
liberty in this country.
We can protect ourselves and main-
tain our basic liberties. That is what
this amendment does.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate Mr. AMASH
bringing it, and I urge support.
Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE).
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I
thank Mr. AMASH for yielding me time
and for his leadership on this issue.
Let me also thank Chairman SMITH
for his tremendous leadership of the
committee and for working with us on
this critical amendment, as well as so
many other amendments in this bill.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Amash-Lee amendment to
the National Defense Authorization
Act.
This amendment guarantees that
persons arrested on U.S. soil under the
2001 Authorization for Use of Military
Force or provisions under the 2012
NDAA will receive the due process that
they deserve, as required by the Con-
stitution.
The 2012 NDAA codified worldwide
detention authority that, as the ACLU
said at the time, ‘‘violates the Con-
stitution and international law because
it is not limited to people captured in
an actual armed conflict, as required
by the laws of war.’’
The Amash-Lee amendment would
remedy that by repealing that provi-
sion and ensuring that we remain con-
sistent with our fundamental values.
Mr. Chairman, we should have no
doubts that our Federal criminal
courts can handle international ter-
rorism cases, and indeed they have.
The Department of Justice has
charged, tried, and convicted more
than 200 defendants for international
terrorism crimes in these very Federal
courts.
That is why I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this critical amendment.
I, again, want to thank Representative
AMASH and Chairman SMITH for their
leadership on this issue.
Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, may I
ask how much time remains.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Michigan has 1 minute remaining.
Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, leaving
these powers on the books is not only a
dangerous threat to our civil liberties,
but also undermines one of our strong-
est assets in trying suspected terror-
ists: Article III courts and domestic
law enforcement.
Since September 11, the Federal Gov-
ernment has successfully prosecuted
hundreds of defendants charged with
crimes related to international ter-
rorism. Our Constitution works.
Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my
colleagues, Representative BARBARA
LEE and Chairman SMITH, for joining
me on this amendment. I urge all of my
colleagues to support it, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, for some years now,
there have been some people in the
country who go around ginning up con-
cern that Americans are going to be
whisked out of their beds at night and
taken to Guantanamo and left there in-
definitely.
This sort of scaremongering has been
used to call attention to themselves. It
has been used to raise money.
As Chairman SMITH noted, we have
had some debates on this issue in the
past. It had kind of died down when ev-
erybody realized that 18 years after 9/11
it hadn’t happened.
Yet, there are still some out in the
countryside who try to frighten people
that, well, it could someday. Well, ac-
tually, it can’t.
Let me read three provisions, start-
ing with the FY 2012 NDAA that said,
‘‘Nothing in this section shall be con-
strued to affect existing law or au-
thorities relating to the detention of
U.S. citizens, lawful resident aliens of
the United States, or any other persons
who are captured or arrested in the
United States.’’
Now, that says nothing here affects
any right of U.S. citizens or those cap-
tured or detained inside the United
States. That was part of the law to
begin with.
Another part of the law to begin with
says, ‘‘The requirement to detain a per-
son in military custody under this sec-
tion . . . does not extend to citizens of
the United States.’’
Well, we passed that in 2012. There
were some concerns, so we come back
the very next year and have a rule of
construction that has been passed and
signed into law.
It says that:
Nothing in that law or in the AUMF shall
be construed to deny the availability of the
writ of habeas corpus or deny any constitu-
tional rights in a court ordained or estab-
lished by Article III of the Constitution for
any person in the United States when de-
tained pursuant to an AUMF and who is oth-
erwise entitled to such writ or rights.
So, we have belts, suspenders, ropes,
pretty much anything you can think
of, to make sure that no one inside the

United States, no U.S. citizen’s con-
stitutional right is affected. And it
hasn’t been. For 18 years this has not
been a problem.
So, I would suggest, Mr. Chairman,
that it is not a problem now, that it is
not something that we need to tinker
with, especially with so many court de-
cisions that have interpreted some of
the legal issues related to detainees.
In fact, we should push back against
attempted scaremongering and reject
this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 476, the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. SMITH) and the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY) each will
control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL).
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chair, I rise to
speak on two important amendments
that have been included in this en bloc.
Michigan has been hit very hard by
this PFAS contamination. It is in our
drinking water, groundwater, rivers,
lakes, and ponds. We can’t eat the fish
that are being caught.
These harmful chemicals are found in
way too many places, and they are dis-
covering more contamination sites
each day.
Just today, 100 new PFAS contami-
nation sites were identified, with many
sites registering PFAS levels above
100,000 parts per trillion. EPA’s non-
enforceable health advisory is 70 parts
per trillion. And the more we test, the
more we find.
There are two amendments here. I
was proud to work with FRED UPTON,
DAN KILDEE, and TIM WALBERG on leg-
islation that is included in this en bloc
that would require the Department of
Defense to enter into cooperative
agreements with States to mitigate
PFAS contamination resulting from
their facilities.
Unfortunately, firefighting foam was
used at more than 100 military bases
and has impacted them and the sur-
rounding communities across the coun-
try. We need an all-hands-on-deck re-
sponse to the growing PFAS contami-
nation at military facilities.
Also included is a bipartisan amend-
ment to protect our servicemembers
from ever being exposed to harmful
PFAS chemicals in MREs, Meal,
Ready-to-Eat.
MREs are carried by our servicemem-
bers in the field of operations or when
engaged in training exercises. Our
warfighters depend on MREs for their
survival, so it is critical these food
packages are completely safe. Cur-
rently, there is no prohibition on the
use of PFAS chemicals in MREs, and
they are in there.
This bipartisan amendment would
proactively correct this and simply
prohibit the Defense Logistics Agency
from using any food contact substances
with PFAS to assemble or package
MREs.
I thank Chairman SMITH for includ-
ing both of these amendments.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE).
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chairman of the committee for work-
ing with me on addressing this PFAS
contamination issue.
Today, the House is taking historic
action to address PFAS contamination
that is hurting communities, including
communities like the city of Oscoda in
my district in Michigan.
At the beginning of the year, I
launched the bipartisan Congressional
PFAS Task Force to bring together
Members of Congress who are dealing
with contamination in their districts.
We wanted to work together on mean-
ingful legislation to address PFAS and
to protect public health.
I am very pleased to stand here
today, 6 months later, in support of
these amendments. The package of
amendments included in this en bloc
will help address PFAS contamination
and ensure people have access to safe
drinking water.
Included in the package are three of
my amendments.
The first would direct the U.S. Geo-
logical Survey to look for PFAS con-
tamination around the country so we
know where people are potentially ex-
posed.
My second amendment would require
the Government Accountability Office
to conduct a review of the military’s
response to PFAS contamination and
its efforts to clean it up.
Another amendment that I was proud
to work on with my friend, Congress-
woman DEAN from Pennsylvania, is to
end the use of PFAS by the military by
2025. This will protect servicemembers
from being exposed to these dangerous
chemicals.
These provisions will mean fewer vet-
erans, servicemembers, and families
will face struggles like those in my dis-
trict have faced. I am proud to see this
come to the floor. I thank the chair-
man for his work on this.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs.
MILLER).
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Chair, I rise today
to speak about my amendment in-
cluded in en bloc No. 11.
Mr. Chair, my amendment would be-
stow the privilege of lying in honor in
the rotunda of the United States Cap-
itol to the last surviving Medal of
Honor recipient of the Second World
War.
From the beaches of Normandy,
across the seas of Japan, and into the
deserts of Africa, the Greatest Genera-
tion fought selflessly to protect free-
dom around the world. It is our duty to
honor the sacrifices they made to safe-
guard hope and liberty for all.
The walls of this historic building
have seen the most courageous mem-
bers of our society. Americans from
coast to coast come here to pay their
respects to the heroes of our history,
an ability that would not be possible
without the responsibilities that fell on
to our brave parents and grandparents.
We must ensure our children and
grandchildren remember those who
worked to secure our Nation and freed
the world from tyranny.
When I started working on this, there
were four. Now, there are only three

living recipients of the Medal of Honor
who went above and beyond the call of
duty during World War II, one of whom
is a dear friend and West Virginia na-
tive, Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams, who
fought valiantly during the Battle of
Iwo Jima.
In this time of deep political divide,
honoring our Nation’s greatest heroes
is something we can all come together
and agree upon. I ask all Members to
support my amendment to honor our
Greatest Generation and preserve their
legacy as defenders of freedom.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from California (Mr. PANETTA).
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Chair, today, I
rise in support of an amendment to the
underlying bill, the National Defense
Authorization Act.
The NDAA is a bill that articulates
our defense priorities and secures our
national interests. I am very, very
proud and thankful to Chairman SMITH
and committee staff to have incor-
porated a number of provisions into
this bill. Of particular importance, I
am honored to have included a provi-
sion that improves privatized military
housing.
I think all of us can agree that it is
imperative that the Department of De-
fense develop a holistic solution to
remedy systemic privatized military
housing issues and empower service-
members and their families.
I saw this need firsthand in my dis-
trict while engaging with servicemem-
ber constituents throughout this past
year. That is why I offered legislation
that was included in the NDAA that
enhanced transparency, communica-
tion, and accountability standards.
The core elements of this bill, the
Better Military Housing Act, included
a tenant bill of rights, housing advo-
cacy, and an improved work order sys-
tem.
This amendment that I am speaking
about today adds two additional impor-
tant provisions.
First, it authorizes an additional $5
million for new military housing con-
struction, utilizing the Army’s high-
performance and healthy living All-
American Abode design.
Second, it requires the Department
of Defense to provide an accounting for
the legal services available to service-
members harmed by health or environ-
mental hazards while living in
privatized military housing.
We must continue to prioritize the
health and safety and the lifestyles of
our servicemembers and their families.
They serve us. Let’s continue to serve
them.
I thank Chairman SMITH, the com-
mittee, the professional staff, and my
colleagues for their support on my
amendments.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN).
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I
thank Chairman SMITH for giving me
these minutes to talk about two
amendments that I have brought forth
that are part of this en bloc.
First is an amendment about PFAS,
which we have heard a little bit about
already. It is important to understand
that our military is storing and plan-
ning to destroy millions of gallons of
material that contain PFAS, which is a
class of chemicals that contaminate
drinking water and is linked to serious
health problems.
These materials must be destroyed
for the sake of the health of our com-
munities, but that needs to be done in
a way that protects our environment,
not in a way that causes us yet more
harm.
My amendment directs the Secretary
of Defense to ensure that all inciner-
ation of materials containing PFAS is
conducted in a manner that eliminates
PFAS while also ensuring that no
PFAS is emitted into the air in the
process. It also sets clear guardrails for
storage, byproducts, and appropriate
facilities for disposal.
I thank Mr. KHANNA for cosponsoring
this measure so we can protect our
communities from further PFAS con-
tamination.
The second amendment I wish to ad-
dress will help us understand the uni-
verse of defense contractors that have
willfully violated Federal health, safe-
ty, and labor standards that protect
American workers. American people
work hard to build the infrastructure
necessary to keep our country safe. We
have a responsibility to honor that
work by paying them fairly and keep-
ing them safe, as the law requires.
We have a responsibility to make
sure that contractors taking Federal
dollars are not recklessly neglecting
the health, safety, and dignity of our
working people. That is why this sim-
ple amendment is so necessary.
I thank Congresswoman HAALAND for
cosponsoring this amendment, and I
thank, again, Chairman SMITH for all
of his hard work.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS).
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I want to
start talking about science and juris-
diction and why it is important to go
through regular order.
We just heard my colleagues talk
about PFAS or PFOS or PFOA, three
different things that mean three dif-
ferent things. What my colleagues have
done is lumped them all into one cat-
egory. If you eliminate one class of
chemicals, you take the F–16 and you
ground it. You have got Ethernet ca-
bles, fiber channel assemblies, round
cable assemblies, shielded twisted pair,
EMI.
This is a National Defense Authoriza-
tion bill, and the Rules Committee has
allowed an amendment on the National
Defense Authorization bill that would
ground the F–16s without doing due
justice to science and the committees
of jurisdiction.
There are a couple of other problems
with the en bloc amendment.
Again, this amendment requires ac-
tion on all PFAS, all of it. There may
be 3,000 to 5,000 different permutations
of this chemical. All these substances
are not alike.
Also, EPA has said it knows little of
the PFAS class and only has a valid
tool to really identify 18 out of the
3,000 to 5,000 formulations. If EPA can
only identify right now 18, how do you
identify 1,500 permutations of this
chemical?
Second, the amendment skirts sci-
entific risk criteria and dismisses ex-
pert administration review, especially
the provisions banning PFAS in
MREs—we heard that—and containers.
According to the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, I mentioned this earlier
on another amendment, this would ban
substances used in assembling and
packaging, which there is no known
safety concern. The FDA approves
packaging for food, but we are going to
ban packaging for food when it is the
jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, which is not the jurisdic-
tion of HASC.
Third, as drafted, these amendments
could create confusion, overreach, and
mismatched responsibility among Fed-
eral partners. The PFAS ban and the
MRE language requires the Defense Lo-
gistics Agency to implement it, but
MREs are sold at commercial grocery
stores. So are we going to have the De-
fense Logistics Agency police PFAS
MRE packaging in the local Piggly
Wiggly or Walmart or other guns and
knives stores?
b 1900
The incineration provisions require
the Secretary of Defense to administer
and enforce requirements on inciner-
ation of items.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield an additional 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Illinois.
Mr. SHIMKUS. So we have been at-
tacking the administration of the De-
partment of Defense saying they can’t
do their job, they don’t meet the IG
standards, and now we are going to put
them in control of air emissions and
clean air standards.
That is what this does when you
allow amendments to a bill that are
not germane to the underlying com-
mittee.
Last, provisions require the U.S. Geo-
logical Survey to come up with PFAS
detection performance standards, insti-
tuting a nationalized sampling pro-
gram at PFAS-contaminated sites and
own the results. Yet the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, which only
has a minor ability to consult role, has
statutory responsibility for cleanup
sites. USGS will be messing around
with and will be dependent upon the
USGS to obtain its data.
So it is the EPA that is responsible
for cleanup, but we are going to give

the U.S. Geological Survey the respon-
sibility.
Many of these amendments are not
germane to the defense authorization
or have received process to ensure they
don’t create problems. Quality work in
these areas would have followed reg-
ular order. Americans deserve that we
are as careful doing our jobs as they
are doing theirs. We mentioned this in
the other amendment.
I am working with Chairman TONKO
to address perfluorinated compounds.
It is a very difficult issue. We have ex-
perts in the majority; we have experts
in the minority that deal with chemi-
cals. This is not the place to do it, and
I would ask people to vote against the

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 476, the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. SMITH) and the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY) each will
control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms.
KUSTER).
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Chair, I thank the distinguished gen-
tleman from Washington for yielding.
I was pleased to offer an amendment
to H.R. 2500 to expand the liberal con-
sideration standard given by discharge
review boards and boards for the cor-
rection of military records to victims
of military sexual trauma, to survivors
of intimate partner violence and do-
mestic abuse.
Members of the Armed Forces who
were victims of intimate partner vio-
lence have sometimes received less
than honorable discharges because of
behavior caused by their underlying
trauma. This discharge status may ex-
clude them from receiving veterans
benefits, including services to help ad-
dress their trauma.
Less than honorable discharge
statuses are associated with higher
rates of homelessness and suicide. Sim-
ply put, these discharge statuses are
retraumatizing, and survivors deserve
better.
My amendment would have ensured
victims of intimate partner violence
receive the same liberal consideration
standard as other victims of sexual as-
sault in the Armed Forces. All sur-
vivors should be believed and treated
with compassion, regardless of the vio-
lence they experienced.
I appreciate the willingness of the
House Armed Services Committee staff
to work with my team to try to get
this provision included in the House
NDAA. Unfortunately, due to budg-
etary rules, we were unable to find a
path forward. A provision that mirrors
my amendment was included in the
Senate NDAA, thanks to the tremen-
dous leadership of Senators GILLIBRAND
and ERNST.
Chairman SMITH, when the House and
Senate conferences our two bills, will
you work with the Senate to see this
provision included in the final con-
ference bill?
I yield to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman
from New Hampshire for her leadership
on this issue, and I agree that it is a
very important issue.
Absolutely, we will work with the
Senate to do our best to address it once
we get to conference, and, again, I
thank the gentlewoman for her work
on this.

July 11, 2019
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Chair, I thank the gentleman for his
response.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank
my good friend, the distinguished rank-
ing member, for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, for years, books and
articles have been written suggesting
that significant research had been done
at U.S. Government facilities, includ-
ing Fort Detrick and Plum Island, to
turn ticks and other insects into bio-
weapons. Now, a new book, ‘‘Bitten:
The Secret History of Lyme Disease
and Biological Weapons,’’ by Kris
Newby, includes interviews with Dr.
Willy Burgdorfer, the researcher who is
credited with discovering Lyme dis-
ease. It turns out Dr. Burgdorfer was
also a bioweapons specialist.
The interviews combined with access
to Dr. Burgdorfer’s lab files reveal that
he and other bioweapons specialists
stuffed ticks with pathogens to cause
severe disability, disease, even death to
potential enemies.
With Lyme disease and other tick-
borne diseases exploding in the United
States, with an estimated 300,000 to
427,000 new cases each year and 10 to 20
percent of all patients suffering from
chronic Lyme disease, I believe Ameri-
cans have a right to know whether any
of this is true.
If true, what were the parameters of
the program?
Who ordered it?
Was there any accidental release
anywhere or at any time of any of the
diseased ticks?
Were any ticks released by design?
In the book, there is some talk of
that happening at or near Richmond,
Virginia. Can any of this information
help current-day researchers—and this
is most important of all—help current-
day researchers find a way to mitigate
and maybe even cure these diseases?
It should be noted for the record that
it was President Richard Nixon in 1969
who ordered the end to all bioweapons
research, but we know that there were
tick farms at Plum Island and Fort
Detrick, like I said earlier, and other
places where this research was done.
We need to know. I encourage Mem-
bers to read this book if they get the
time, ‘‘Bitten: The Secret History of
Lyme Disease and Biological Weap-
ons.’’ Again, it may offer some clues as
to how we combat this terrible epi-
demic of Lyme disease in the United
States.
My amendment tasks the DoD Inspector
General to ask the hard questions and report
back. The millions of people suffering from
Lyme and other tick-borne diseases deserve
to know the truth.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New Mexico (Ms.
HAALAND), a member of the committee.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support
of my amendment requiring reporting
on human rights in Brazil in light of
the Bolsonaro administration’s dan-
gerous actions.
President Bolsonaro has said he
wants to strip constitutional land
rights from Brazil’s indigenous people.
He has openly stated that indigenous
people should have been exterminated.
His threats go beyond words.
Bolsonaro’s administration has already
begun infringing upon the rights of in-
digenous people and other vulnerable
groups.
Despite this alarming behavior,
President Trump named Brazil a major
non-NATO ally. Congress can and must
use its authority to direct and block
funds and conduct oversight.
The Bolsonaro administration must
understand that increased U.S. co-
operation is conditional upon respect
for the rights of the people of Brazil,
including indigenous people, Afro-Bra-
zilians, women, and LGBTQ commu-
nities.
Congress is watching, and we must
demand accountability.
Mr. Chairman, I also rise to support
my amendment, which prohibits the
Department of Defense from con-
tracting with companies that do not
have a sexual harassment policy.
Now more than ever, people are em-
powered to speak up and change the
culture in the workplace. Congress, the
Department of Defense, and many
other workplaces have or are imple-
menting policies to hold perpetrators
accountable. We must demand the
same from those who do business with
our government.
In fiscal year 2017, the Department of
Defense spent $320 billion on contrac-
tors. If these contractors are going to
receive Federal dollars, they should be
subject to the same accountability.
My amendment will ensure that con-
tractors have sexual harassment poli-
cies in place prior to signing on the
dotted line. All workers must be pro-
tected in the workplace, especially
when they are working to protect our
country.
I urge my colleagues to support
workers and pass this amendment and
pass the en bloc package.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCARTHY), our Republican leader.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, on July 4, a 6.4 mag-
nitude earthquake hit Ridgecrest, Cali-
fornia. A day later, our Ridgecrest
community experienced a 7.1 mag-
nitude earthquake.
To put that in perspective, the
Northridge quake that, 20 years ago,
severely cost 60 lives and others and
crippled Los Angeles was less than
that.
People felt this throughout southern
California, but the epicenter of these
earthquakes was located on the Naval
Air Weapons Station China Lake.
Hundreds of aftershocks have already
occurred and are still occurring.
The Navy announced that, due to
earthquake-related damage, China
Lake was not mission capable and that
nonessential personnel had to be evacu-
ated. This is significant because China
Lake, along with neighboring installa-
tions, form a cornerstone of our na-
tional defense architecture that inte-
grates all operational domains: air,
land, sea, space, and cyberspace.
The men and women who work here
help test and develop the technology
needed to equip our warfighters with
the very best weapons and tools to en-
sure our military remains second to
none.
Now, my amendment, which I offered
with Congressman COOK, was included
in the en bloc package. It would au-
thorize $100 million to help address
China Lake’s most immediate needs,
and it requires the Department of De-
fense to develop a plan by October 1 to
assess, repair, and modernize the infra-
structure and facilities at China Lake
and other installations in the R–2508
Special Use Airspace Complex that was
damaged by the earthquakes.
The extent of this damage is still
being assessed, but we need to ensure
that we are not only repairing this im-
portant base to address the threats fac-
ing our Nation today, but in the years
ahead.
Mr. Chairman, I want to be clear to
my constituents in Ridgecrest, in Kern
County, this amendment is just an ini-
tial step in helping China Lake and the
communities I represent impacted by
these earthquakes make sure they re-
cover.
Over the coming days, weeks, and
months, I ask my colleagues in this
Chamber and the U.S. Senate to join
with me to ensure Ridgecrest, China
Lake, and all communities impacted
by earthquakes and natural disasters
have our full support and are provided
the resources they need to quickly re-
build and get back to normal.
I also ask my colleagues to join me
in thanking all the local first respond-
ers, the local, State, and Federal emer-
gency response officials who have
worked nonstop over the past several
days to ensure our constituents af-
fected in Ridgecrest were safe, have
food and water and a place to sleep.
Finally, I also want to thank the
thousands of residents across our com-
munities for their help, their actions,
and their prayers for their neighbors in
need.
It is said adversity does not build
character; it reveals it. Earthquakes
can shake our foundations, but the
residents of Ridgecrest should hold
their heads high. In this time of adver-
sity, their true character has shown
and is an inspiration to all of us.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment.

H5654 July 11, 2019
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman, I
thank Chairman SMITH, Ranking Mem-
ber THORNBERRY, and all the Armed
Services Committee members for all
their hard work on this bill.
I rise in support of the en bloc pack-
age, which contains four amendments I
have introduced.
Mr. Chair, Iran has engaged in reck-
less conduct, destabilizing the region,
with their attacks on allied tankers
near the Strait of Hormuz and with the
support of terrorist organizations, in-
cluding Hezbollah and Hamas. We must
remain vigilant with Iran.
My amendment ensures that the De-
fense Department reports on threats to
freedom of navigation on all inter-
national waterways.
My second amendment directs the
Defense and State Departments to send
recommendations to Congress to im-
prove the Cooperative Threat Reduc-
tion Program. This will help eliminate
nuclear material and prevent prolifera-
tion.
My third amendment prohibits funds
and support from going to foreign ter-
rorist organizations, including Hamas,
Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad,
al-Shabaab, and the Islamic Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps, by adding these
to the prohibited list in section 1224 of
this bill. We must stop terrorism in its
tracks.
Finally, brave Americans of every
background have served in our Armed
Forces, including Jewish American vet-
erans who fought Nazis in World War
II.
My fourth amendment requires the
Defense Department to question
whether our Active Duty servicemem-
bers have experienced anti-Semitism
while bravely serving our country.
Mr. Chair, I urge support for this bi-
partisan en bloc package of amend-
ments.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL).
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair, I
thank the chairman of the full com-
mittee, and I thank the ranking mem-
ber for yielding.
Today I rise in support of Mr. ROSE’s
amendment to the National Defense
Authorization Act. This amendment,
which I cosponsored, takes the nec-
essary steps to target bad actors re-
sponsible for the illegal trafficking of
fentanyl into the United States.
Across Arkansas, heartbroken fami-
lies have told me their stories time and
time again about how the opioid crisis
has claimed the lives of their loved
ones.
According to the CDC, in 2017, more
than 130 Americans lost their lives to
opioid abuse each day, nearly half of
those deaths attributable to fentanyl.
We have a responsibility to stem the
tide of this crisis. Targeting the source
of the world’s largest producers and
distributors of fentanyl will begin to
stop the flow of these drugs.
Mr. Chair, I am grateful to Mr. ROSE
for this effort, which complements
work that I have been doing over the
past year with my friend, Senator TOM
COTTON, to fight this plague.
Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking mem-
ber for yielding, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’
vote on this en bloc package.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN).
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of
this en bloc package, and I would also
like to speak in favor of en bloc pack-
age No. 10, which includes four of my
amendments.
The first would mandate that the
President provide Congress with a copy
of National Security Presidential
Memorandums related to military op-
erations in cyberspace.
Congress has a vital role to play in
ensuring that offensive cyber oper-
ations do not inadvertently undermine
stability in cyberspace. Unfortunately,
the White House has continuously sty-
mied our efforts and attempts to con-
duct this constitutionally-protected
oversight, refusing to provide impor-
tant policy documents that took effect
nearly a year ago.
Ironically, I have largely supported
the administration’s more forward-
leaning posture, but regardless of my
feelings towards the underlying strat-
egy, it is unacceptable that the White
House continues to stonewall our at-
tempts to oversee sensitive operations.
This amendment will stop that ob-
struction.
A second amendment ensures that
new software acquisition pathways will
include cybersecurity metrics. I
strongly support updating how the
Pentagon buys software, but it is im-
portant that we have explicit measures
of the security of the code that we are
buying.
Now, I hope that this amendment
will both drive the adoption of metrics
related to common software weak-
nesses and lead to broader changes,
such as increased use of type-safe pro-
gramming languages.
Finally, this package includes two
amendments related to our Special Op-
erations Forces.
The first extends by 3 years a rel-
atively new irregular warfare author-
ity, which is designed to address
threats in the gray zone below the level
of armed conflict in order to gauge its
use and effectiveness.
The second would strengthen require-
ments that the Department notify Con-
gress before exercising a counterterror-
ism authority referred to as 127 Echo.
This authority has proven its worth
over the last decade, but I believe that
we must continue to improve our rig-
orous oversight to ensure appropriate
use.
Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this
en bloc package and my amendments
in en bloc package No. 10.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 1 minute to the distinguished
gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
RIGGLEMAN).
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I
rise today in support of my amend-
ment, which directs the Secretary of
Defense to develop a plan for a pilot
program to train skilled technicians
for placement in the defense industrial
base, including critical shipbuilding
skills such as welding, metrology, qual-
ity assurance, machining, and additive
manufacturing.
Mr. Chair, I would like to begin by
thanking my friends, colleagues, and
fellow Virginians, Representatives
LURIA, WITTMAN, MCEACHIN, and
BEYER, for their partnership on this
amendment.
Our Nation’s defense industrial base
is a critical aspect of our Nation’s na-
tional security and economic pros-
perity. We must continue to adapt this
industry to respond to the emerging
challenges and global realities that
face our country. One such challenge is
training a workforce that can maintain
the required tools and products our
Armed Forces need.
The Defense Industrial Base report to
the President dated October 2018 stat-
ed: ‘‘Without concerted action that
provides both a ready workforce and
continuously-charged pipeline of new
employees, the U.S. will not be able to
maintain the large, vibrant, and di-
verse machine tools sector needed.’’
This amendment helps the Depart-
ment of Defense close the gap in our
Nation’s workforce that threatens our
global competitiveness and military
capabilities. It will help America mod-
ernize its workforce and create a pipe-
line of new employees who support our
security apparatus.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA
S. HORN).
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman
SMITH for yielding.
I rise today to speak about two
amendments in this en bloc package
that are critical to the Nation’s secu-
rity and good governance.
The first is a bipartisan amendment
that addresses the need for oversight
and accountability in our national se-
curity infrastructure. This bipartisan
amendment directs the IG to audit
DOD departments and agencies to de-
termine if excess profit and cost esca-
lation on sole-source contracts has
taken place. This is important not only
for our bases and maintenance, but it
impacts our Nation’s readiness.
While we understand that contrac-
tors and suppliers need to make a prof-
it, that doesn’t mean that our taxpayer
dollars should go to fund excess profits
and escalations that are well outside of
the norm.
This good governance is reasonable
and helps us to ensure our Nation’s se-
curity while being good stewards of the
taxpayer dollars.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5655
July 11, 2019
The second amendment in this en
bloc package addresses our Nation’s se-
curity in a different way: that of the
air traffic controllers, who pay into
their retirement throughout their ca-
reer until they are forced to retire at
the age of 56, many of whom are our
Nation’s veterans.
Right now, we are experiencing a se-
vere shortage of air traffic controllers
across this Nation, and retired air traf-
fic controllers are some of the most
qualified supervisors and trainers.
However, under current law, all FERS
retirees either must work under 1.5
days per week or full-time, otherwise,
they lose their Federal retirement.
This amendment allows all retirees
to simply retain their hard-earned re-
tirement dollars that they have paid
in, so we can train the next generation
of air traffic controllers.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.
STAUBER).
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chair, I thank
the chairman and ranking member for
including my amendments in these en
bloc amendments.
Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple.
It requires the Secretary of the Navy
to create a report regarding the feasi-
bility of doing maintenance work on
naval vessels at shipyards other than
shipyards in the vessel’s home port.
Currently, the Navy has a tremen-
dous maintenance backlog, but under
current law, there are certain restric-
tions that limit where naval vessels
can undertake maintenance repair. Un-
less these restrictions are lifted, the
Navy’s backlog will only increase expo-
nentially.
At the same time, there are fully
qualified shipyards in the rest of the
United States, including the Great
Lakes region, Gulf Coast, and Alaska,
that can perform repair work for cer-
tain types of naval vessels. Yards such
as Fraser Shipyards in Superior, Wis-
consin, have the capacity and skills to
do this work. They just need the
chance.
I know Fraser Shipyards and others
are dedicated to the national security
mission of the United States and would
be an efficient and competent service
provider, and I am certain Fraser Ship-
yards and others within the Great
Lakes do not stand alone in this proc-
ess.
Although these vessels may not be
homeported in these regions of the
country, it should be within the Sec-
retary’s discretion to decide what
types of vessels could be sent to such
shipyards to help with the Navy’s
maintenance backlog. This could in-
clude noncombatant vessels, vessels
with minimal crews, or other vessels
that only need limited periods of time
in shipyards for the repair work.
The opportunity to create additional
geographic repair centers presents the
United States Navy an opportunity to
diversify their industrial base, create
resiliency, and improve our military
readiness.
Mr. Chair, I want to thank Congress-
man DUFFY and Congressman COX for
cosponsoring this amendment, and I
encourage all of my colleagues to sup-
port the en bloc amendment.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I have no further speakers. I reserve

Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the

Ms. DEAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chairman of the committee and I also
thank the designee for yielding me this
time.
I am pleased to introduce two amend-
ments to the National Defense Author-
ization Act that deal with PFAS con-
tamination issues.
The first amendment, amendment
125, provides an additional $5 million
for the nationwide Centers for Disease
Control and the Agency for Toxic Sub-
stances and Disease Registry PFAS
health study, authorizing a total of $15
million for this critical research.
We know that PFAS chemicals are
linked to devastating health con-
sequences and are present in 99 percent
of Americans, but many questions re-
main unanswered. This study will help
get the answers our constituents de-
serve and the solutions we need.
b 1930
I thank Representatives KILDEE,
FITZPATRICK, UPTON, PAPPAS, BOYLE,
ROUDA, and others for cosponsoring
this amendment.
The second amendment, Amendment
No. 126, phases out the Department of
Defense’s use of AFFF firefighting
foam by 2025, reducing PFAS contami-
nation and protecting our commu-
nities.
The amendment also substantially
limits the Department of Defense’s
ability to use waivers from 6 years to 1
year. Currently, the Department of De-
fense can use waivers that allow the
use of AFFF firefighting foam up to
2035, almost a decade longer than this
phaseout provision would allow.
I thank, again, Representatives KIL-
DEE and PAPPAS for supporting this
amendment.
I also thank Chairman SMITH and his
extraordinary staff for working with
me on these critically important
issues.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
have no speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. STAN-
TON).
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, few things are as pa-
triotic—as American—as serving our
Nation in the United States Armed
Forces. My amendment, amendment
No. 17, would ensure that noncitizens
defending our country receive the re-
sources they need to pursue the citi-
zenship they have earned.
Specifically, my amendment will
modify the pre-separation counseling
checklist administered to servicemem-
bers to provide them an opportunity to
request further information regarding
expedited naturalization.
Throughout history, many legal per-
manent residents have demonstrated
their commitment to the United States
by volunteering to serve their adopted
country by putting on the uniform and
joining the United States Armed
Forces. Unfortunately, we have all seen
reports that there may be thousands of
deported U.S. veterans because they
failed to apply for citizenship for a va-
riety of reasons. Deporting these patri-
otic veterans does not reflect our
American values.
As a country that honors our vet-
erans, we need to take the appropriate
steps to ensure that those who volun-
teered to serve are not deported be-
cause they were unaware of the bene-
fits available to them.
My amendment provides a safety net
that ensures noncitizen servicemem-
bers who defended our country are
aware of these benefits.
Mr. Chairman, my amendment No. 14
allows veterans who are enrolled in
their respective service’s Wounded
Warrior program to continue their en-
rollment in the Military Adaptive
Sports Program for an additional year
after separation.
Currently, once a servicemember sep-
arates from the U.S. Armed Forces,
they no longer qualify for their respec-
tive service’s Wounded Warrior pro-
gram. My amendment would change
this by extending eligibility for an ad-
ditional year during their transition to
civilian life.
It is reported that veterans, in their
first year after separating from uni-
formed service, sadly, experience sui-
cide rates at approximately two times
higher than the overall veteran suicide
rate. This is even higher for wounded
veterans. My amendment looks to com-
bat this devastating statistic by pro-
viding veterans with continued phys-
ical, psychological, and social rehabili-
tation during the first year of transi-
tion.
Mr. Chairman, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this amendment
package.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.
WILD).
Ms. WILD. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to urge my colleagues to vote
yes on a bipartisan amendment to ad-
dress the opioid crisis that affects our
servicemembers so severely. And I
thank my fellow Pennsylvanian and
friend, BRIAN FITZPATRICK, for joining
me in tackling this issue.
This amendment would establish a
partnership between the Department of
Defense and academic health centers to
work on three key areas:
One, focused research on reducing
our servicemembers’ dependency on
opioids;
Two, the development of new meth-
ods of pain management and mental
health strategies; and
Three, partnerships with industry
that would advance technologies for
wounded servicemembers that will im-
prove their day-to-day lives.
The opioid epidemic is not and can-
not be a bipartisan issue. It hits com-
munities all across the country, re-
gardless of ethnicity, race, or socio-
economic status. But the epidemic is
spreading to our servicemembers at an
alarming rate.
Our servicemembers have unique
challenges. Studies show that 15 per-
cent of servicemembers use opioids fol-
lowing injuries while deployed, which
is almost four times the civilian aver-
age of 4 percent. As a result, addiction
is higher among servicemembers than
in the civilian population and is rising.
Over a 3-year period, the percentage of
misuse nearly tripled. That is why this
amendment is so critical.
Our servicemembers protect all of us
and we can protect them by passing
this amendment and curtailing the
devastating addictions of our American
heroes.
Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of this
amendment.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
continue to reserve the balance of my
time.

July 11, 2019
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. SCHNEIDER).
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chairman, I
thank my colleague from Oklahoma for
yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support
of my amendment codifying the Boots
to Business program and authorizing it
for 5 years.
The men and women who ably serve
our Nation with honor deserve our sup-
port as they transition from military
to civilian life. Many of our service-
members have the temperament, drive,
and skills to excel in small business.
They excel as small-business owners
and as entrepreneurs, but they often-
times lack the industry-specific experi-
ence to turn their dreams into reality.
The Boots to Business program helps
bridge this gap by offering exiting serv-
icemembers and military spouses a 2-
day in-person course on business own-
ership, followed by more in-depth in-
struction through an 8-week online
course.
Since the program launched in 2013,
more than 50,000 veterans have partici-
pated.
Earlier this week, the House Small
Business Committee held a hearing on
veteran entrepreneurship. We had the
chance to hear from veterans who
turned their careers as small-business
owners successfully after benefiting
from the programming and training
provided by the Boots to Business pro-
gram.
Codifying this important program is
a bipartisan effort, and I urge my col-
leagues to join us in support of the
Boots to Business program and more
opportunities for our veterans.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much
time is remaining on each side?
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. STANTON).
The gentlewoman from Oklahoma has 3
minutes remaining. The gentleman
from Texas has 10 minutes remaining.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER).
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chairman, I
thank Representative HORN for allow-
ing me to speak on these issues.
Mr. Chairman, my amendment sup-
ports small businesses by directing the
Secretary of the Navy to adhere to
competitive procedures whenever pos-
sible. This will not only make it easier
for smaller contractors to compete on
an even playing field with billion-dol-
lar corporations, but it is also good
governance.
Approximately 2,000 businesses pro-
vide support to the military and de-
fense sectors in Washington State. In
the last 3 years, businesses were award-
ed nearly $15 billion in related con-
tracts.
Our small businesses, many of which
are owned by veterans, are a driving
force in our economy, especially in
Washington State. By ensuring con-
tracts are awarded on a competitive
basis, we can save the Federal Govern-
ment millions of dollars in acquisition
and sustainment costs.
Also, for NDAA, I partnered with my
friend and colleague, Representative
RICK LARSEN, to ensure communities
facing the greatest risk of fire have eq-
uitable access to firefighting and emer-
gency equipment.
Two Federal programs, the Fire-
fighter Property Program and the Fed-
eral Excess Personal Property Pro-
gram, transfer excess Department of
Defense property to the U.S. Forest
Service, which then provides it to
States for use in firefighting. This
property includes trucks, tools, hoses,
vehicles, and aircraft parts, as well as
protective clothing.
However, these programs do not cur-
rently distribute equipment based on
need or risk, but rather on a first-
come, first-served basis. This bill will
allow for need to be taken into consid-
eration when this equipment is avail-
able so that we can improve fire-
fighting and emergency service capa-
bilities where they are needed most.
Lastly, I thank my colleague, Rep-
resentative STIVERS, for partnering
with me to ensure that the Secretary
of Defense is conducting research on
the reproductive health of female serv-
icemembers and making that research
public. With our military forces diver-
sifying, it is important that we address
issues identified for improvement in
that research.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I encourage my col-
leagues to support the en bloc package,
as well as the NDAA upon final pas-
sage, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, l rise
today to voice my support for my three
amendments to H.R. 2500, the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.
My first amendment requires an annual up-
date of the climate vulnerability and risk as-
sessment tool by the Secretary of Defense.
This tool will play a critical role in measuring
the impact of climate change on our defense
infrastructure, therefore we must ensure that it
is routinely updated to reflect a rapidly chang-
ing climate.
My second amendment ensures that cultural
competence and diversity are integrated in the
recruitment and retention efforts of mental
health providers for our active duty service
members. It is essential that these providers
reflect the diversity of our troops and are cul-
turally competent in their treatment services.
My third amendment mandates the installa-
tion and maintenance of carbon monoxide de-
tectors in all military family housing units. This
will ensure that our armed services families
are protected against the risk of carbon mon-
oxide poisoning in their own homes.
I urge my colleagues to support these
amendments.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendments en bloc offered by
the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms.
HORN).
The en bloc amendments were agreed
to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN)
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
THORNBERRY) each will control 10 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
LYNCH).
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
support of the en bloc amendment that
includes my amendment to reestablish
the Commission on Wartime Con-
tracting.
As the chairman of the Sub-
committee on National Security, I can
say with great confidence that the
Commission on Wartime Contracting
has been a solid and a reliable partner
in congressional oversight of military
spending.
From 2008 to 2011, the Commission on
Wartime Contracting held 25 hearings
and issued 8 reports on critical over-
sight on issues including contingency
contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan
and embassy security in those coun-
tries.
The bottom line is that the Commis-
sion on Wartime Contracting found
tens of billions of dollars in waste,
fraud, and abuse, and recommended
ways to improve our overseas contin-
gency contracting process.
Despite the Commission’s mandate
having ended in 2011, today we con-
tinue to expend billions of reconstruc-
tion dollars overseas with little assur-
ance that taxpayers or our sons and
daughters in uniform are getting the
full benefit of those expenditures. In
fact, in many cases, we know that they
are not. As the Special Inspector Gen-
eral for Afghanistan Reconstruction re-
cently noted, many of our projects
there are of questionable value or are
at serious risk of failure and require
continued, sustained oversight.
Reauthorization of the Commission
on Wartime Contracting will provide
additional oversight to help us avoid
the wasteful mistakes of the past.
In closing, I thank Chairman SMITH,
Ranking Member THORNBERRY, and the
gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms.
KENDRA S. HORN) for supporting my
amendment.
b 1945
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I have
no speakers here at this time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Nevada
(Mr. HORSFORD).
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
I am honored to stand to propose an
amendment to the National Defense
Authorization Act, which is an oppor-
tunity to improve the security of the
American people and modernize de-
fense policy to meet the demands of
emerging security threats.
For the first time in years, House
Democrats finally have the chance to
voice our priorities for national de-
fense. That is why I am happy to intro-
duce this amendment, which will in-
crease by $5 million the Air Force Uni-
versity Research Initiatives.
This program provides Department of
Defense grants to competing univer-
sities, including those in Nevada like
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas,
and the Desert Research Institute, and
gives our best and brightest minds the
opportunity to do the research nec-
essary to develop advanced defense
technology.
Throughout U.S. history, it has been
our continued research and innovation
that has secured America as the
world’s greatest power. My amendment
transfers money from Special Oper-
ations Command theater forces, which
is already robustly funded, and, in-
stead, invests in the wars of the future.
As security threats advance and
change with weapons of modern war,
we must remember that innovation and
development made us number one. We
must invest in programs that prepare
our servicemembers to respond to the
threats of the 21st century.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, the last speaker made a
comment that this is the first time in
many years that House Democrats
have an opportunity to put their prior-
ities on a defense bill. I realize the gen-
tleman is new to this body, but that
statement is simply not true.
Last year, the House Armed Services
Committee reported the bill to the
floor by a vote of 60–2. There were more
Democratic amendments made in order
under the Rules Committee last year
on the floor than there were Repub-
lican amendments. The bill passed the
House with 351 votes.
It has been a hallmark of the Armed
Services Committee to work in a col-
laborative way and to give every mem-
ber of the committee and, ultimately,
of the House the opportunity to make
an imprint on the nature of this bill.
The reason I have to take a moment
is just to contrast that with what has
happened this year. Both the vote com-
ing out of committee and the fact that
of the contested amendments—in other
words, of those amendments where
there was some disagreement, some de-
bate, and a potential vote. There were
about 60 Democratic amendments, and
there was exactly one Republican
amendment.
That limits the ability of the minor-
ity to shape the outcome of the final
bill. So the gentleman’s statement has
led me to want to emphasize the dif-
ference this year versus prior years. I
think it is too bad, but I hope that at
some point in this process, we can re-
turn to that collaborative process.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair,
I appreciate the gentleman’s com-
ments, and I think he is absolutely
right in the first half, and absolutely
wrong in the second half.
I would disagree with my colleague’s
comments that Democrats have not
had an opportunity to contribute to
the process. We have in the past. We
worked in a bipartisan way.
It is, however, not true that this year
everything is different. Something was
different, but not what I believe the
ranking member said. That is that we
did include a large number of Repub-
lican provisions, certainly in com-
mittee by the amendment process, and
on the floor.
The one sort of stark number here is,
on the floor, we have not had a large
number of Republican amendments.
There are a couple of reasons for that.
Number one, we have, I think, 15 or 16
en bloc packages, and there are a large
number of Republican amendments
contained in that en bloc package.
But as far as standalone amend-
ments, there are a couple of problems.
One, traditionally, and this has hap-
pened to us as well, we had a lot of our
more controversial amendments, un-
less the majority party—at the time,
the Republicans—thought it was to
their advantage to have us vote on
something that made us look bad, then
they would let it in. Otherwise, they
wouldn’t.
We kind of did the same thing. If
there were amendments that we didn’t
want, we didn’t keep them. We did
allow for Republican priorities.
The reason, however, that there are
fewer Republican amendments than in

the past is because, for a long time, it
has been the minority party’s plan this
year to not support this bill. This is
not a new thing. This has been a de-
bate.
As I mentioned yesterday, the reason
for that was purely partisan. And it is
traditional. I have been working as a
legislator long enough to know that
when Members are in the minority,
they want the majority party to fail.
So whatever bill they are bringing up,
the minority tries to defeat it to gain
leverage.
The Armed Services Committee has
traditionally been different from that.
We don’t do that on this bill. We work
together in a collaborative process to
create the bill.
But this year, the minority party de-
cided to treat the defense bill like
every other bill: We are in the minor-
ity. We want the bill to fail.
The evidence of that is that I have
worked with a lot of Members to try to
get amendments straightened out in
Rules. On one in particular, we worked
with Representative STEFANIK.

she didn’t like the way we did it, so she
wanted to fix it. It had to do with the
Under Secretary for Intelligence and
the title. It is kind of irrelevant what
it was, but we worked with her, and we
got it solved.
We had it ready to go, and she pulled
it today. She said she didn’t want to do
it.
As I understand it, the reason was
that she didn’t want to feel obligated
to vote for the bill because we had co-
operated and worked with her. Well,
how obnoxious of us to do that.
The games that are being played here
are not primarily being played by us.
Let me say to this body that I am 100
percent committed to maintaining the
bipartisanship of this committee, and
what happened this year won’t change
that at all.
I will say, in the past, the Repub-
licans have not been as kind. We had a
Member who voted against the bill in
committee a few years back. He found
out the next year that he got nothing
in the bill because voting against the
bill was not allowed. We had a lot of
Members vote against it this year. I am
not going to do that. We are going to
keep working together.
I want everyone listening to know
that we on the Democratic side are not
the ones being partisan in this bill.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate the comments
of Chairman SMITH about the bipar-
tisan contributions in the past, and
that was the primary point I wanted to
make.
I do disagree with him about one key
point. It was certainly never my inten-
tion, and I do not believe the intention
of any member of the Armed Services
Committee, to oppose this bill from the
beginning.
As a matter of fact, as I indicated
yesterday, for many of us, it was a very
challenging decision on how to vote
with the bill coming out of committee,
not because there weren’t serious, sub-
stantive disagreements—there were—
but there was hope that it was possible
to bridge those disagreements so that
there could be some bend on both sides
to get to our traditional sort of bipar-
tisan vote on the floor.
What definitely changed and is un-
precedented is to have one substantive,
contested Republican amendment al-
lowed on the floor—one—versus 60
Democratic amendments. Those num-
bers speak for themselves. There has
been, other than the one amendment
on low yield—Mr. TURNER yet to
come—no other opportunity by Repub-
licans on a contested issue.
There have been en blocs, Republican
and Democratic, absolutely. That is
the way it is every year. But as far as
standalone debates where it is con-
tested, there has been one opportunity
for Republicans to improve this bill.
That has been disheartening because it
makes it much more difficult for peo-
ple on this side of the aisle to get to
where we can support this bill.
I share the chairman’s commitment.
This is not about us. This is about the
troops. Our commitment is to work
through every step of whatever it takes
to get to a point that we can do good
by the men and women who serve. That
is the objective here.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR).
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding to me.
Mr. Chair, the amendment that I
offer aims to expand the Department of
Defense’s authority to work with the
Coast Guard on youth science, tech-
nology, engineering, and math pro-
grams.
For several years, I have worked
closely with the U.S. Coast Guard to
engage on youth STEM programs. Ear-
lier this year, the Coast Guard came to
me and acknowledged that to continue
our efforts, they needed new authority
and advice. The specialties these dedi-
cated public maritime servants rely
upon daily is rooted in science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics,
yet they do not have the authority to
engage beyond volunteer status in
their communities to build special ca-
pabilities in young people for the fu-
ture.
Meanwhile, the Department of De-
fense offers excellent examples of the
benefits of such programming and
holds the respective experience in suc-
cessful applications, such as the
STARBASE program.
Now more than ever, the future of
our country, our very prosperity and
security, depends on an effective and
inclusive STEM education-reliant
workforce. That begins with our youth.
Basic STEM concepts are best
learned at an earlier age and are cen-
tral prerequisites for career technical
training, advanced college-level and
graduate study, and success in various
workplaces.
Given the Coast Guard’s mission of
coastal defense, maritime law enforce-
ment, and maritime operations, the
Coast Guard, too, has a vested interest
to advance STEM youth exposure.
With my amendment, we can invest
in the future of America’s youth and
the Coast Guard itself by expanding
the Department of Defense’s ability to
work with the Coast Guard on youth
STEM programming to transfer know-
how. I urge my colleagues to support
this amendment.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I have
no further speakers at this time, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues
to support the en bloc package, as well
as the NDAA upon final passage, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendments en bloc offered by

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5670 July 11, 2019
Specifically, this amendment is in-
tended to help military academy can-
didates who have stuttering-related
speech disorders.
Madam Chair, 5 to 10 percent of all
children stutter. Boys are two to three
times more likely to stutter than girls.
Approximately 75 percent of children
recover from stuttering, but the re-
maining 25 percent will experience life-
long effects.
I learned about the issue of stut-
tering and its implications for a suc-
cessful military career through the ex-
periences of a legislative fellow cur-
rently serving in my Washington, D.C.,
office. He is a 2016 graduate from the
United States Naval Academy with a
degree in operations research and a
veteran naval officer who was sepa-
rated from the Navy in April 2019. His
separation was not due to any fault of
his own but because of the current
processes of the United States Navy
and the United States Naval Academy
relating to speech fluency issues relat-
ing to stuttering.
Let me also say that there was an ad
that we have seen on television about a
young man who was confronting a doc-
tor during World War I and World War
II. It had to do with ancestry. He was
insisting that he was in good health,
and the doctor said no. The end of the
story is they showed that he prevailed,
and he went to World War I or II and
even won a Purple Heart.
This Navy lieutenant’s stuttering
was not severe and undetectable to
most individuals who engage him in
conversation. He went on to secure a
screening by the flight doctor. The
flight doctor then administered a
speech fluency test. During the test,
his speech fluency did not meet naval
standards, but he was an important
contributor to the United States Navy.
At the time, he advised the doctor
that he might not be able to do the sur-
face war command officer that he had
selected even though he wanted to be
an aviator. He then went on to another
discipline, surface warfare officer.
Then after graduating from the United
States Naval Academy with an oper-
ations research degree, he served
aboard the USS Scout.
His captain said that he was able in
every way. It was clear that he might
not be able to be a surface warfare offi-
cer, but he was able.
What happened was a tragedy. He
went on to seek extra care. His overall
speech fluency improved. The captain
decided that transferring to a different
community would be the best option.
That was the captain’s decision.
Unfortunately, because of the speech
impediment that could not be heard, he
was sent to a Probationary Officer Con-
tinuation and Retention Board, the
wrong board to be sent to, and a speech
impediment was not considered a med-
ical issue. Therefore, he could not go
before the medical board.
This very fine African American
graduate of the academy could not
serve because we did not do him serv-
ice. We did not do him the kind of serv-
ice that he needed to have. Unfortu-
nately, this board was not really meant
for someone who was capable, quali-
fied, and ready. This is one where you
do not have a right to appeal, if you
can imagine that, and no one ever noti-
fies you why.
I am here today to say that my
amendment will, hopefully, have an
impact on the many different young
soldiers who want to serve.
Madam Chair, can you believe a half
million dollars was spent on his edu-
cation?
Let me indicate that this amendment
is supported by the National Stut-
tering Association. The National Stut-
tering Association says that we sup-
port the Jackson Lee amendment No.
203 that allows for military academy
candidates to have access to, and op-
tions for, undergoing speech therapy to
successfully manage speech disorders
or impediments so that entry into offi-
cer or occupational specialist positions
in the military is possible. Military
personnel who stutter can be and are
effective communicators, and stut-
tering does not limit military career
aspirations.
Jimmy Stewart became an aviator in
World War II and reached the rank of
brigadier general on July 23, 1959, a lit-
tle later than World War II. He retired
from military service on May 31, 1968.

tering Association and the famous peo-
ple who stutter.

Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE,
Washington, DC.
CONGRESSWOMAN SHEILA JACKSON LEE: The
National Stuttering Association (NSA) is the
largest non-profit organization in the world
dedicated to bringing hope and empower-
ment to children and adults who stutter,
families and professionals, through support,
education, advocacy, and research. We have
long worked with individuals and commu-
nities to increase understanding of stut-
tering and to improve outcomes for people
who stutter in all aspects of their lives.
Over the last several years, we have en-
hanced outreach efforts to raise stuttering
awareness to colleges and universities, em-
ployers and the military. A recurrent theme
we hear from young people and adults who
stutter are barriers to employment and ca-
reer success based on false assumptions
about stuttering. To that end, we have devel-
oped and enhanced educational outreach pro-
grams for employers, which of course in-
cludes the military. Just last year, a stut-
tering support chapter was launched at
Wright Patterson AFB, at the request of per-
sonnel who stutter.
We support Jackson Lee Amendment #203
that allows for military academy candidates
to have access to, and options for, under-
going speech therapy to successfully manage
speech disorders or impediments so that
entry into Officer or Occupational Special-
ists positions in the military is possible.
Military personnel who stutter can be, and
are, effective communicators and stuttering
does not have to limit military career aspi-
ration.

tant act. Feel free to contact us anytime for
additional support or resources.

for certain career opportunities in the mili-
tary it matters a great deal if someone has
even a slight almost imperceptible stutter.
Michael Pender’s story began with his en-
rollment at the Naval Academy in 2012. Mr.
Pender dreamed of becoming a naval aviator
from an early age. During the naval aviation
screening during his junior year at Annap-
olis, the USNA flight doctor reviewing his
medical records and USNA application and
noticed that Mr. Pender had a history of
speech disfluency. The flight doctor then ad-
ministered a speech fluency test to Mr.
Pender. During the test, Mr. Pender’s speech
fluency did not meet the Naval Aviation
community’s standards, and he was told that
he was disqualified from serving as an avi-
ator.
Mr. Pender was disappointed with the de-
termination. At that critical juncture Mr.
Pender was not informed about what careers
he could qualify to fill that would not be im-
pacted by the determination regarding his
speech. He was given an opportunity to take
speech therapy, which he did until his grad-
uation.
Mr. Pender selected the only unrestricted
line option left—the Surface Warfare com-
munity. At the time, Mr. Pender advised the
flight doctor that the demands for speech
fluency would be more of an issue as a Sur-
face Warfare Officer. His concerns were not
satisfactorily addressed nor was he provided
with counseling to assist him in selecting an
appropriate career following his graduation.
After graduating from the United States
Naval Academy, Mr. Pender served onboard
the USS Scout (MCM 8) in San Diego, where
he began his training as a Surface Warfare
Officer. After serving diligently for 18
months and qualifying in all required Sur-
face Warfare watch-stations except for the
position of Officer of the Deck, it was clear
that his speech impediment would keep him
from earning his Surface Warfare Officer
qualification.
An Officer of the Deck is the captain’s rep-
resentative when the captain is not on the
bridge of the ship. Officer of the Deck gives
verbal orders to sailors who drive the ship. It
was difficult for Mr. Pender to give orders in
a timely manner without delay due to his
speech impediment. Mr. Pender wanted to
address the issue and sought out a speech
therapist who would accept TRICare insur-
ance to improve his speech as he pursued his
Officer of the Deck qualification. His overall
speech fluency improved, but not enough to
give the Captain confidence to qualify Mr.
Pender as Officer of the Deck. Mr. Pender
and his Captain decided that transferring to
a different community would be the best op-
tion.
Since stuttering is not classified as a med-
ical issue, a Medical Board was not an option
to review his case. Once he completed his
education at Annapolis the options for ca-
reer change within the branch was extremely
limited. In 2018, after consulting with other
officers, Mr. Pender’s Captain and Executive
Officer decided that the best course of action
was to submit a redesignation package to
the Probationary Officer Continuation and
Retention Board (POCR), with the intention
that he would re-designate into a different
community. In order to start this process,
Mr. Pender’s Captain submitted a Surface
Warfare Officer non-attainment letter to the
POCR Board. In that letter, Mr. Pender’s
captain stated that Mr. Pender would not be
able to qualify as Surface Warfare Officer,
not because of a lack of aptitude or work
ethic, but because of his speech impediment.
The POCR Board has the authority to reas-
sign a Naval Officer to another Naval Com-
munity, which the Navy’s method of reas-
signing personnel to a new job. The POCR
Board got back to Mr. Pender in September
2018 stating that he would be removed from
the Active Duty List and he would be re-
tained on the Reserve Active Status list, ef-
fectively separating him from the Navy
without any due process or a right to appeal
the decision.
It is disappointing that he had to separate
from the Navy for two reasons. First, he was
not put into a position to succeed coming
out of the Naval Academy. His speech im-
pediment was a known condition at the
Naval Academy, and their service selection
process should have evaluated Mr. Pender’s
speech impediment to see if he would be suc-
cessful as a Naval Aviator or a Surface War-
fare Officer. Second, he should have been
given a chance to serve in a restricted line
community. Even if his speech impediment
was not caught until he ultimately started
his service as a Naval Officer, there should
be a process in place where officers who can-
not qualify in their respective unrestricted
line communities due to conditions that are
not covered for Medical Boards are given a
fair chance to serve in one of the many re-
stricted line communities. The POCR Board
process should only be reserved for officers
that were not able to qualify due to a lack of
desire or aptitude. In conclusion, there were
plenty of other communities in the Navy
where Mr. Pender would have been able to
serve, and it is a shame that he is separated
from the Navy.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair,
let me also indicate that I am very
glad and grateful for amendment No.
201 that adds $10 million to research
dealing with triple negative breast can-
cer.
Between 10 and 17 percent of female
breast cancer patients have this condi-
tion, and I believe this is crucial to
helping military women and others.
Amendment No. 202 deals with PTSD.
We have added $2.5 million. I am grate-
ful for this amendment. We are recog-
nizing that more and more young peo-
ple coming out have a continuation of
PTSD. Currently, there are 31.3 million
people in the United States being
treated for PTSD.
Let me also say that I am grateful
for the seven other amendments that
have been added.
Jackson Lee amendment No. 195 cre-
ates housing for disaster survivors.
No. 145 has the DOD engage in efforts
to stop Boko Haram.
No. 147 has to do with recruiting stu-
dents who go to the Defense National
Security Education Program. It pre-
vents them from being recruited by for-
eign governments.
Also, No. 148 deals with stopping a re-
port on maternity mortality rates.
Amendment No. 149 deals with the
risk posed by debris in low Earth orbit.
No. 160 deals with the idea of training
in cybersecurity, cyber defense, and
cyber operations for elementary, sec-
ondary, and postsecondary students.
Then, No. 620 deals with artificial in-
telligence education strategic opportu-
nities and risks.
Madam Chair, may I ask how much
time I have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. BONAMICI).
The gentlewoman has 40 seconds re-
maining.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair,
my remaining comments are to simply
say the amendment that is close to my
heart is the one dealing with this acad-
emy graduate, this Naval Academy
graduate. We asked everyone to give
him another chance because the only
thing that he was deficient in is not in
heart, soul, and willingness to serve,
but it was because he had a speech im-
pediment.
How shameful for us to deal with our
young men and women like that.
I thank my colleagues for supporting
this amendment. I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote
on the Jackson Lee amendments and
the Jackson Lee amendment that deals
with the idea of making sure young
people have the medical care, the serv-
ice, and the ability to serve after grad-
uating from an academy with $500,000
invested in this young man, and all my
other underlying amendments.
Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to
support them.
Madam Chair, I thank Chairman SMITH and
Ranking Member THORNBERRY for their work
on this bill and their devotion to the men and
women of the Armed Forces.
I also thank them for including in this En
Bloc ten Jackson Lee Amendments.
My remarks will focus on three of the Jack-
son Lee Amendments and the others are ad-
dressed in my statement for the record.
Jackson Lee Amendments No. 201, No.
202, and No. 203, make important contribu-
tions to the bill.
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 201 author-
izes and encourages increased collaboration
between the DOD and the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) to combat Triple Negative
Breast Cancer;
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 202 author-
izes $2.5 million in increased funding to com-
bat and treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder;
and
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 203 directs
the Secretary of Defense to promulgate regu-
lations to ensure that candidates granted ad-
mission to attend a military academy undergo
screening for speech disorders and be pro-
vided the results of the screening test and a
list of warfare unrestricted line (URL) Officer
positions and occupation specialists that re-
quire successful performance on the speech
test. Academy students shall have the option
of undergoing speech therapy to reduce
speech disorders or impediments.
Specifically, Jackson Lee Amendment No.
203 is intended to help military academy can-
didates that have stuttering related speech
disorders.
Five to ten percent of all children stutter as
they develop language skills.
Boys are 2 to 3 times more likely to stutter
than girls.
Approximately 75 percent of children re-
cover from stuttering, but the remaining 25
percent will experience life-long effects of stut-
tering.
There are many famous and accomplished
persons who stutter.
One well known person who stuttered was
Jimmy Stewart a much beloved actor who also
served in the Air Force during World War II.
Jimmy Stewart was a pilot during WWII and
rose to the rank of Chief of Staff of the 2nd
Combat Wing, 2nd Air Division of the 8th Air
Force.
As a member of the Air Force Reserves
Jimmy Stewart continued his military service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5672 July 11, 2019
On July 23, 1959, Jimmy Stewart achieved
the rank of Brigadier General.
He retired from military service on May 31,
1968.
Stuttering can make it difficult to commu-
nicate with other people, which often affects a
person’s quality of life and interpersonal rela-
tionships.
Stuttering can also negatively influence job
performance and opportunities, and treatment
can come at a high financial cost.
I offer this amendment to help entrants into
military academies, who may have a related
stuttering speech disorder, find the right career
fit for their military service after graduation.
I learned about the impact of stuttering may
have on promising military careers through the
experience of a remarkable young man who is
currently serving as a Legislative Fellow in my
Washington, D.C., office.
He is a 2016 graduate of the United States
Naval Academy with a degree in Operations
Research and a veteran naval officer who was
separated from the Navy in April 2019.
His separation was not due to any fault of
his own, but because of the current processes
of the United States Navy and the United
States Naval Academy relating to speech flu-
ency issues related to stuttering.
This Navy Lieutenant’s stuttering was not
severe, and undetectable to most individuals
who engage him in conversation.
However, for certain career opportunities in
the military it matters a great deal if someone
has even a slight, almost-imperceptible stutter.
His story began with his enrollment at the
Naval Academy in 2012.
He dreamed of becoming a naval aviator
from an early age.
During the naval aviation screening during
his junior year at Annapolis, the Naval Acad-
emy flight doctor reviewing his medical
records and USNA application, noticed that he
had a history of speech disfluency.
The flight doctor then administered a
speech fluency test to him.
During the test, his speech fluency did not
meet the Naval Aviation community’s stand-
ards, and he was told that he was disqualified
from serving as an aviator.
He was disappointed with the determination.
At that critical juncture he was not informed
regarding the career paths he was qualified to
fill, notwithstanding his speech.
He was given an opportunity to take speech
therapy, which he did until his graduation.
He selected another unrestricted line option
left open to him–the Surface Warfare commu-
nity.
At the time, he advised the flight doctor that
the demands for speech fluency would be
more of an issue as a Surface Warfare Offi-
cer.
After graduating from the United States
Naval Academy with an Operations Research
degree, he served onboard the USS Scout
(MCM 8) in San Diego, where he began his
training as a Surface Warfare Officer.
After serving diligently for 18 months and
qualifying in all required Surface Warfare
watch-stations except for the position of Offi-
cer of the Deck, it was clear that his speech
impediment would keep him from earning his
Surface Warfare Officer qualification.
An Officer of the Deck is the captain’s rep-
resentative when the captain is not on the
bridge of the ship.
Officer of the Deck gives verbal orders to
sailors who drive the ship.
It was difficult for him to give orders in a
timely manner without delay due to his speech
impediment.
He wanted to address the issue and sought
out a speech therapist who would accept TRI-
Care insurance to improve his speech as he
pursued his Officer of the Deck qualification.
His overall speech fluency improved, but not
enough to give the Captain confidence to
qualify him as Officer of the Deck.
He and his Captain decided that transferring
to a different community would be the best op-
tion.

ical issue, a Medical Board was not an option
to review his case.

olis, the options for career change within the
branch were extremely limited.

his Captain and Executive Officer decided that
the best course of action was to submit a re-
designation package to the Probationary Offi-
cer Continuation and Retention Board
(POCR), with the intention that he would re-
designate into a different community.

a Surface Warfare Officer non-attainment let-
ter to the POCR Board.

face Warfare Officer, not because of a lack of

sign a Naval Officer to another Naval Commu-
nity, which is the Navy’s method of reas-
signing personnel to a new job.

tember 2018, stating that he would be re-
moved from the Active Duty List and he would
be retained on the Reserve Active Status list,
effectively separating him from the Navy with-
out any due process or a right to appeal the
decision.
The Medical Board findings returned in
March 2019 and stated that it was the stut-
tering that caused the anxiety order, and stut-
tering is not an issue that is covered for Med-
ical Boards.
It is disappointing that he had to separate
from the Navy for two reasons.
First, he was not put into a position to suc-
ceed coming out of the Naval Academy.
His speech impediment was a known condi-
tion at the Naval Academy, and its service se-
lection process should have evaluated his

Medical Boards are given a fair chance to

munities.
The POCR Board process should only be
reserved for officers that were not able to
qualify due to a lack of desire or aptitude.
In conclusion, there were plenty of other
communities in the Navy where he would have
been able to serve, and it is a shame that he
is separated from the Navy.
I, and my Staff have benefited greatly from
his insights on improving the experience of
military cadets as well as his commitment to
public service as a Legislative Fellow in my of-
fice.
I am sure he will find success in his next
endeavor and I thank him for his service to
our nation.
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 202 author-
izes $2.5 million in increased funding to com-
bat and treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Today, 223.4 million people, which rep-
resents seventy percent of adults living in the
United States, have experienced some type of
traumatic event at least once in their lives.
As many as 20 percent of those who experi-
ence a traumatic event develop PTSD.
Currently, there are 31.3 million people in
the United States being treated for PTSD.
An estimated 8 percent of Americans or
24.4 million people at any given time will be
experiencing PTSD.
Nearly 50 percent of women and 60 percent
of men will experience at least one trauma in
their lifetime.
For Veterans, this may mean surviving an
IED explosion or an accident during a training
exercise or witnessing the death or injury of a
buddy.
Among people who are victims of a severe
traumatic experience like what may occur dur-
ing military conflict, an estimated 60 to 80 per-
cent will develop PTSD.
Ten to thirty percent of combat veteran’s
lifetime will experience PTSD at some point
during their lives.
Studies estimate that 1 in every 5 military
personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan
has PTSD.
20 percent of the soldiers who’ve been de-
ployed in the past 6 years have PTSD. That’s
over 300,000 soldiers.
17 percent of combat troops are women; 71
percent of female military personnel develop
PTSD due to sexual assault within the ranks.
I thank the Chair and Ranking Member for
including this Jackson Lee Amendment to
combat PTSD for consideration of H.R. 2500.
This Jackson Lee Amendment provides au-
thorization for a $10 million increase in funding
for increased collaboration with NIH to combat
Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
This Jackson Lee Amendment authorizes
and encourages increased collaboration be-
tween the DOD and the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) to combat Triple Negative Breast
Cancer.
‘‘Triple Negative Breast Cancer’’ is a term
used to describe breast cancers whose cells
do not have estrogen receptors and progester-
one receptors, and do not have an excess of
the ‘‘HER2’’ protein on their cell membrane of
tumor cells.
The lack of receptors in this form of breast
cancer makes commonly used test and meth-
ods to detect the disease not as effective.
This is a serious illness that effects between
10–17 percent of female breast cancer pa-
tients and this condition is more likely to cause
death than the most common form of breast
cancer.
Seventy percent of women with metastatic
triple negative breast cancer do not live more
than five years after being diagnosed.
The Jackson Lee Amendment will help to
save lives.

Latina women, and women with a ‘‘BRCA1’’
genetic mutation, which is also prevalent in
Jewish women.
TNBC usually affects women under 50
years of age and makes up more than 30 per-
cent of all breast cancer diagnoses in African
American.
African American women are far more sus-
ceptible to this dangerous subtype than white
or Hispanic women.
The collaboration between the Department
of Defense and NIH to combat Triple Negative
Breast Cancer can support the development of
multiple targeted therapies for this devastating
disease.
Triple negative breast cancer is a specific
strain of breast cancer for which no targeted
treatment is available.
The American Cancer Society calls this
strain of breast cancer ‘‘an aggressive subtype
associated with lower survival rates.’’
In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control
predicted that that year 26,840 black women
would be diagnosed with TNBC.
The overall incidence rate of breast cancer
is 10 percent lower in African American
women than white women.
African American women have a five-year
survival rate of 78 percent after diagnosis as
compared to 90 percent for white women.
The incidence rate of breast cancer among
women under 45 is higher for African Amer-
ican women compared to white women.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells account
for between 13 percent and 25 percent of all
breast cancer in the United States and are
usually of a higher grade and size, are more
aggressive and more likely to metastasize,
and onset at a much younger age.
Currently, 70 percent of women with meta-
static triple negative breast cancer do not live
more than five years after being diagnosed.
African American women are 3 times more
likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer
than white women.
African-American women have prevalence
for TNBC of 26 percent versus 16 percent in
non-African-Americans women.
African-American women are more likely to
be diagnosed with larger tumors and more ad-
vanced stages of breast cancer.
Currently there is no targeted treatment for
TNBC exists.
For this reason, I appreciate the support
that the Armed Services Committee has
shown for this amendment by including it in
En Bloc No. 8, and I ask my colleagues to
support this Jackson Lee Amendment.
Mr. THORNBERRY. I continue to re-
serve the balance of my time, Madam
Chair.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. ROSE).
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam
Chair, I rise today in support of my bi-
partisan amendment in both the House
and Senate to the National Defense Au-
thorization Act, a necessary leap for-
ward in combating the opioid crisis by
cracking down on illegal fentanyl from
China, Mexico, and other countries.
I would like to acknowledge and
thank the cosponsors of this amend-
ment, my colleagues FRENCH HILL, AN-
THONY BRINDISI, BRIAN FITZPATRICK,
DAVID TRONE, and CONOR LAMB.
This amendment will place sanctions
on drug manufacturers that knowingly
provide fentanyl to traffickers, on
transnational criminal organizations
that mix fentanyl with other drugs and
traffic them into the U.S., as well as fi-
nancial institutions that assist these
traffickers.
Critically, my amendment also au-
thorizes new funding to U.S. law en-
forcement and intelligence agencies to
go after fentanyl traffickers while es-
tablishing a commission on fentanyl
and opioid trafficking to ensure that
we make progress here.
Kids are dying in my district, in
Staten Island, south Brooklyn, and
New York City, and they are dying
around the country because of deadly
fentanyl.
We know where it is coming from. It
is about time that Congress does some-
thing about it. The days when a person
or a company could find safe harbor in
another country, flood our streets with
drugs, and face no consequences have
to be over.

INSTALLATIONS.
(a) REVIEW REQUIRED.—Not later than 180
days after the date of the enactment of this
Act, the Secretary of the Air Force, in con-
junction with the Defense Logistics Agency,
shall complete a review considering—
(1) the need for, and benefits of, the con-
struction of new, or maintenance of existing,
direct fuel pipeline connections at Air Na-
tional Guard and Air Force Reserve installa-
tions; and
(2) the barriers, including funding needs
and any inconsistent guidance and consider-
ation of such projects by the Air Force, that
may impede such projects.
(b) ELEMENTS OF REVIEW.—The review re-
quired by subsection (a) shall include the fol-
lowing:
(1) An analysis of the extent that the Air
Force and Defense Logistics Agency have
identified direct fuel pipeline projects as an
effective and efficient way to enhance the
ability of regular component, Air National
Guard, and Air Force Reserve installations,
to improve the readiness of affected units
and help them to meet their mission require-
ments, including an assessment of how the
Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve
facilities, across all States and territories,
can leverage such connections to better sup-
port current and emerging air refueling re-
quirements.
(2) An assessment of how direct fuel pipe-
line connections enhance the resiliency and
efficiency of the installations and help meet
existing Defense Logistics Agency require-
ments for secondary storage and other fuel
requirements.
(3) A list of Air National Guard and Air
Force Reserve installations that currently
do not have a direct connection pipeline but
have access to such a pipeline within reason-
able proximity (less than five miles) to the
facility.
(4) An overview and summary of the cur-
rent process for considering such proposals,
including the factors used to consider re-
quests, including the weight provided to each
factor and including a list of Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve installations
that have sought funding for projects to cre-
ate direct access to a national fuel pipeline
or to maintain access to such pipelines over
the last five years.
(5) A list of the total instances in the past
five years in which projects for direct fuel
pipeline connections have been approved for
regular component, Air National Guard, or
Air Force Reserve installations, including
the costs of each project and the justifica-
tion for such approval.
(6) A list of Air National Guard and Air
Force Reserve installations with current
pipeline connections that the Air Force or
Defense Logistics Agency has determined
should no longer be used, including—
(A) an analysis of the justifications for
each such determination, such as decisions
to switch from pipelines to using trucks as
the primary fuel delivery method;
(B) an assessment of whether these deter-
minations fairly weigh the costs and benefits
of building or maintaining a pipeline tap as
a practical primary or secondary fuel deliv-
ery method for the installation compared to
railroad, barge terminal, or truck delivery;
and
(C) an assessment of whether these deter-
minations fairly consider or weigh how di-
rect fuel pipeline connections increase secu-
rity for the fuel supply by reducing the
threat of interruption, enhance mission reli-
ability by providing access to greater fuel
storage capability, and the ability of such
projects once completed to better support
the domestic and global operations of the Air
National Guard or Air Force Reserve instal-
lation.
(7) An assessment of how costs associated
with each direct fuel pipeline connection
project is considered by the Air Force or De-
fense Logistics Agency and the weight given
to such costs in the final analysis.
(8) An assessment of the effectiveness or
usefulness of guidance or technical assist-
ance provided to installations requesting or
proposing direct fuel pipeline connection
projects and recommend ways to provide ad-
ditional assistance to ensure the Air Force
and Defense Logistics Agency receive the
most up to date information about the costs
and benefits of proposed projects from instal-
lations.
(9) An assessment of the available funding
sources though the Air Force, Defense Logis-
tics Agency, other Department of Defense
entities, or other mechanisms, such as a pub-
lic-private partnership or enhanced use
lease, that can support direct fuel pipeline
connection projects either in whole or in
part.
(10) An assessment of the extent to which
direct fuel pipeline connection projects have
been incorporated in any comprehensive plan
the Air Force has developed or will develop
regarding investments needed to improve Air
National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and reg-

Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives containing the results of the re-
view required by subsection (a) and rec-
ommendations from the review on how the
Air Force can better expedite and support
the use of fuel pipelines at Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve installations.
Such recommendations shall include options
for accelerating the development and consid-
eration of such projects where most feasible
and appropriate, including whether costs
savings could be obtained by including such
projects as part of other related projects al-
ready authorized at an installation.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN)
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
THORNBERRY) each will control 10 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Chair, I currently have no
speakers, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
have no speakers, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Chair, I encourage my col-
leagues to support the en bloc package,
as well as the NDAA upon final pas-
sage, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Chair, this bipar-
tisan amendment co-sponsored by Congress-
woman WALORSKI will authorize $11 million for
the Wounded Warrior Service Dog Program in
FY 2020, and I want to thank Chairman SMITH
for including this amendment in En Bloc 11.
This lifechanging program will aid our nation’s
veterans by awarding grants to nonprofit orga-
nizations that stand-up, operate, and provide
free assistance dogs to veterans and service
members with physical disabilities, PTSD, or
traumatic brain injuries. Service dogs often be-
come an integral part of a veteran or
servicemember’s treatment team because they
provide both physical and emotional support—
they can protect a veteran who is having a
seizure, remind them to take medications, or
even create a protective physical barrier in a
crowded space.
Madam Chair, this amendment will continue
to effectively expand treatment options for our
veterans and service members and I encour-
age my colleagues to support it.
Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, I rise in support
of my amendments to H.R. 2500 which are in-
cluded in this En Bloc package.
My first amendment is fairly simple and di-
rect. It would remind those in charge of the
DoD’s National Capital Consortium Psychiatry
Residency Program—or PRP—of their respon-
sibility to maintain an environment that is free
of harassment and discrimination.
This critical program helps train profes-
sionals who are on the frontlines of addressing
critical mental health needs. The Chairman
and Ranking Member are both aware of the
tremendous need for such providers, both in
and outside, of the military. It’s those concerns
that are behind the inclusion of Section 717 in
this bill which calls for the Defense Depart-
ment to provide a strategy to recruit and retain
mental health providers.
It is important that this workforce be cul-
turally competent and diverse which is why
ensuring that this program’s leadership ac-
tively work to ensure that residents are trained
in an atmosphere where discrimination or har-
assment of any sort is not tolerated. Period.
What I do know is that tolerating a work en-
vironment that is toxic or being turned toxic
because of racial or sexually derogatory state-
ments or actions makes it harder to recruit
and retain these in-demand providers and also
hurt efforts to ensure a diverse mental health
workforce.
Unfortunately, in 2016, a report by the pro-
gram’s ombudsman noted an ‘‘undercurrent’’
of discrimination in the PRP program and a re-
cent report to my office, while noting improve-
ments, still reported that offensive statements
continue to be made.
Just one report of harmful statements or ac-
tions is one too many. That’s the standard that
we should have and that should be enforced.
This amendment simply makes clear that ra-
cial and gender-based discrimination or har-
assment have no place in the PRP (or else-
where in the military for that matter) and reaf-
firms the need for leaders to proactively work
to provide an environment where such con-
duct is not tolerated.
The military and the taxpayer will invest
much to recruit and train these individuals.
Therefore, it is important that those who par-
ticipate in this demanding residency program
should be able to do so in a safe and harass-
ment free environment.
Additionally, I am pleased about the inclu-
sion in En Bloc 11 of another amendment I of-
fered requesting certain information from the
Air Force.
Fuel is a lifeline for many of the missions
that we ask our men and women in uniform to
carry out. Therefore, it is critical that the Air
Force and Defense Logistics Agency consider
the best options for ensuring that Air Force fa-
cilities, including Air Guard and Air Reserve
facilities, have a reliable and secure fuel sup-
ply.
One effective but under-utilized option are
projects that help Air Guard and Air Reserve
facilities tap nearby national fuel pipelines that
could provide uninterrupted access to millions
of gallons for jet fuel. These projects can be
an effective and efficient way to help these
units carry out their missions, help them to
easily meet Department and Defense Logistics
Agency requirements for a reliable secondary
fuel supply, and help them meet current and
emerging air refueling requirements, among
other benefits, while also reducing the threat
to fuel supplies.
Any delay or disruption to fuel supplies di-
rectly translates into a degradation of mission
readiness.
And in many cases, these projects make
mission and economic sense, like in my dis-
trict, where we are going to build a new fuel
facility less than 1 mile away from an existing
fuel pipeline that would provide millions of gal-
lons of fuel storage and reduce the need for
the 400 plus trucks that currently supply the
base.
According to one estimate, such a pipeline
would provide access to more fuel and cost
less than what it will cost to pay to truck in
significantly less fuel over the next three
years.
The amendment I have offered would re-
quest the Air Force provide information on
how it prioritizes and considers requests to un-
dertake such projects at Air Guard and Air Re-
serve facilities, especially for units where such
projects would help improve mission readi-
ness, among other benefits.
This would include information about the Air
Guard and Air Reserve facilities where such
projects could be of benefit, with an emphasis
on facilities located near fuel pipelines that
they currently do not access, and information
about the criteria used to consider these
projects and barriers such as funding that may
impede such projects.
This amendment builds on an amendment I
successfully offered to the FY 2020 Defense
Appropriations bill when it came before the
House last month to encourage the Air Force
to pursue such projects.
I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member
for their support.

tion (NATO), which came into being through
the North Atlantic Treaty, which entered

component of United States security, and a
deterrent against adversaries and external
threats.
(2) The House of Representatives affirmed
in H. Res. 397, on June 27, 2017, that—

military alliances in history, deterring the

conclusion;
(B) NATO remains the foundation of
United States foreign policy to promote a
Europe that is whole, free, and at peace;

mitted to the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation’s principle of collective defense as
enumerated in Article 5 of the North Atlan-

uct on defense by 2024;

ereignty, territorial integrity, freedom and

bers to meet their 2014 Wales Defense Invest-
ment Pledge commitments; and

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Chair, I have no speakers, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
PERRY).
Mr. PERRY. Madam Chair, I thank
the chairman of the committee for this
opportunity.
Madam Chair, I rise today in support
of my amendment, which will require
the Secretary of Defense to report on
the current level of threat sharing be-
tween the Department of Defense and
the defense industrial base related to
cybersecurity.
Our defense industrial base faces in-
creasing threats from our adversaries,
including Russia and China. The loss of
research and information to cybersecu-
rity hacks is putting our Defense De-
partment’s investments at risk and
eroding the warfighting advantage the
United States maintains over our ad-
versaries.
In June 2018, The Washington Post
reported that a contractor working
with the Navy on a supersonic anti-
ship missile was hacked by the Chinese
Government.
In December 2018, a Defense Depart-
ment Office of Inspector General audit
found that the Army, Navy, and Mis-
sile Defense Agency were failing to
take basic cybersecurity steps to en-
sure that information on America’s
ballistic missile defense system won’t
fall into the hands of our adversaries.
b 2015
I commend the work that the Depart-
ment has already undertaken to ad-
dress this need, but more must be done.
The Department of Defense must
play an active role in identifying cur-
rent threats and helping to fortify the
cybersecurity of our defense industrial
base, which includes many small and
medium-sized businesses, as well as
academic institutions.
This amendment asks the Secretary
of Defense to include a section within
an existing report that examines the
current level of threat sharing between
the Department and the industrial
base.
Madam Chair, I thank the committee
for allowing this amendment to be in-
cluded in the en bloc, and ask the com-
mittee’s indulgence in support of the
amendment. I thank the chairman,
again, for his willingness to allow me
to speak on behalf of the amendment.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
have no further speakers at this point,

SEC. 606. EXEMPTION FROM REPAYMENT OF VOL-
UNTARY SEPARATION PAY.
Section 1175a(j) of title 10, United States
Code, is amended—
(1) in paragraph (1), by striking ‘‘para-
graphs (2) and (3)’’ and inserting ‘‘paragraphs
(2), (3), and (4)’’;
(2) by redesignating paragraph (4) as para-
graph (5); and
(3) by inserting after paragraph (3) the fol-
lowing new paragraph:
‘‘(4) This subsection shall not apply to a
member who—
‘‘(A) is involuntarily recalled to active
duty or full-time National Guard duty; and
‘‘(B) in the course of such duty, incurs a
service-connected disability rated as total

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN)
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
THORNBERRY) each will control 10 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Chair, I currently have no
speakers, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
have no speakers, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Chairwoman, I encourage my
colleagues to support the en bloc pack-
age, as well as the NDAA upon final
passage, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Chair, my amendment
No. 337, which is included in the en bloc
amendment No. 13, clarifies that students
holding or expecting to receive their associate
degree can apply for the Technology and Na-
tional Security Fellowship.
Section 239 of H.R. 2500 creates a new
Technology and National Security Fellowship
program to help increase science, technology,
engineering and math recruitment in our na-
tional security agencies. Those holding or ex-
pecting to receive undergraduate and grad-
uate degrees may apply to be placed in na-
tional security-focused positions for one-year
tours with pay.
In support expanding this kind of opportunity
for young people to serve their country.
But why exclude otherwise qualified appli-
cants simply because they are enrolled in an
associate degree program at a community col-
lege? Over a third of students nationwide and
over half of part-time students are in two-year
colleges, according to the National Center for
Education Statistics. In many parts of our
country, including my district in the Northern
Marianas, community college is the only op-
tion for students pursuing higher education.
Other Defense Department programs for civil-
ian students, such as the Science, Mathe-
matics and Research for Transformation
scholarship program, are already open to ap-
plicants from community college students. Let
us include these students, too, as long as they
meet program standards, and expand the se-
lection pool of those who may serve as Tech-
nology and National Security Fellows.
I urge the adoption of my amendment, so
we can be sure that the Technology and Na-
tional Security Fellowship program is open to
as many qualified students as possible, re-
gardless of what type of college they happen
to enroll in.
I ask my colleagues to support the en bloc
amendment No. 13.
I would like to also express support for the
following amendments to H.R. 2500 I cospon-
sored.
Amendment No. 390 offered by Representa-
tive VELÁZQUEZ of New York extends to all
U.S. territories, including the Northern Mariana
Islands, a provision in law that allows federal
agencies to double the value of a contract
awarded to a Puerto Rico business for pur-
poses of the small business contracting goals.
The amendment ensures equity and further
incentivize contracting opportunities for small
businesses in all the territories.
Amendment No. 182 offered by Representa-
tive HASTINGS of Florida conveys the sense of
Congress that the United States should
promptly begin negotiations on the renewal of
the Compacts of Free Association with our
trusted allies in the Pacific—the freely associ-
ated states of the Republic of the Marshall Is-
lands, the Republic of Palau, and the Fed-
erated States of Micronesia.
We understand the strategic importance of
these Pacific island nations that provide the
U.S. exclusive military use rights covering
huge swaths of land and waters in the West-
ern Pacific. And we know what is at stake for
American interests and security with growing
foreign influence in the region.
The compacts will expire in a few short
years. To keep America strong in the Pacific,
we must move towards expeditious negotia-
tions on renewing the compacts with our close
allies so that Congress may act on approving
and funding the agreements.
Amendment No. 249 offered by Representa-
tive LEE of Nevada aims to improve benefits
and services to veterans through better ac-
countability measures and coordination be-
tween the Departments of Defense (DOD) and
Veterans Affairs (VA). The amendment clari-
fies the purpose of the interagency program
office (IPO) while also directing both depart-
ments to allocate sufficient resources and au-
thorities for the IPO. Requires annual reports
on IPO activities and quarterly reports on VA
and DOD funding to the IPO.
Amendment No. 63 offered by Representa-
tive BANKS of Indiana helps ensure smooth im-
plementation of electronic health records
(EHR) for servicemembers and veterans by
requiring the Department of Defense, Coast
Guard, and the Department of Veterans Affairs
jointly develop a comprehensive enterprise
interoperability strategy.
Amendment No. 236 offered by Representa-
tive LAMB of Pennsylvania also helps ensure
smooth implementation of the EHR for
servicemembers and veterans by setting mile-
stones for achieving interoperability of the
EHR. The amendment further requires DOD
and VA to work with an independent evaluator
to assess and report to Congress on whether
the joint EHR is achieving those milestones.
I urge my colleagues to support these
amendments.
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Madam Chair, the United
States’ relationship with Taiwan is an indis-
pensable component in our efforts to maintain
peace and stability in Asia and across the
globe.
And in today’s digital age, this relationship
should include a strong and robust partnership
on cybersecurity.
Over the past few years, China has clearly
demonstrated its capability and willingness to
conduct cyber-attacks against our country,
such as the state-sponsored economic espio-
nage that led to the indictment of Beijing-
linked hackers last year.
On top of implementing strict retaliatory
measures to deter this malicious behavior, we
should work proactively with our allies to es-
tablish preventative defense plans that lever-
age cybersecurity sharing strategies.
Taiwan is uniquely positioned to partner with
us on our efforts to combat Chinese cyber-at-
tacks, and this amendment will help us move
closer to enhancing our collaboration in this
space so that we stay ahead of our adver-
saries.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

(b) FORM.—The report required by sub-
section (a) shall be submitted in an unclassi-
fied form but may have a classified annex.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN)
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
THORNBERRY) each will control 10 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Chairwoman, I currently have
no speakers, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
have no speakers, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Chairwoman, I encourage my
colleagues to support the en bloc pack-
age, as well as the NDAA upon final
passage, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Chair,
current law requires servicemembers to par-
ticipate in Transition Assistance Program
(TAP) before their anticipated separation date,
and more than 20,000 service members will
transition into civilian life per month over the
next 5 years.
As the former Chairman of the House Vet-
erans Affairs Committee, I have seen how vital
TAP is in preparing all eligible members of the
armed forces for transition to civilian life.
Servicemembers currently undergo 4 hours of
pre-separation counseling, 5 days of class-
room-based instruction, and an optional 2-day
Transition Goals, Plans, Success program.
Yet, the abundant information provided in
these multiple sessions can become an orga-
nizational challenge especially for
servicemembers who are relocating and start-
ing new lives.
While access and advancement in mobile
technology has grown, TAP has yet to provide
servicemembers with a comprehensive online
application accessible through mobile applica-
tion technology to assist with their transition
needs after separation including a personal-
ized profile for employment, education, bene-
fits, mentorship, resume building, and career
training. Additionally, there is currently no ave-
nue for TAP officials to follow
servicemembers’ progress in completing their
TAP requirements and ensure that immediate
and accurate reports are kept.
My amendment calls for a three-year pilot
program through the interagency partners of
the Department of Defense, Department of
Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Labor
to develop an online application that would ad-
dress the current shortfalls in the TAP pro-
gram, consolidate online resources given to
them upon separation, and provide support for
the transitioning needs of servicemembers as
they become veterans.
The online application that would be avail-
able as an app for smartphones or tablets and
accessible through laptops or desktop com-
puters, would create a transition data dash-
board personalized to the veteran. This appli-
cation would provide a resume generator, job
search portal, access to career training, and
mentorship and do it all based on the indi-
vidual military experiences and current geo-
graphic location of the veteran.
This pilot program will ensure the valuable
information provided at TAP is always at vet-
erans’ fingertips in order to help our nation’s
heroes seamlessly transition into civilian life.
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Chair,
En Bloc amendment No. 14 includes my
amendment—cosponsored by DONALD NOR-
CROSS (D–NJ)—to require the GAO to inves-
tigate the contracting practices of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, specifically on how
the agency complies with and enforces the
Davis-Bacon Act to pay locally prevailing
wages on federally-financed construction jobs.
Under Davis-Bacon, the government may
terminate a contract if locally prevailing wages
have not been paid to employees working on
the project. Contracting agencies, such as the
Army Corps, however, have the primary day-
to-day responsibility for enforcement of the
Davis-Bacon Act and its labor standards re-
quirements. Unfortunately, I have heard per-
sistent and credible reports that the Army
Corps’ enforcement efforts are lacking, specifi-
cally at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst,
which is located in my district.
Irresponsible contractors and subcontractors
often times avoid their prevailing wage obliga-
tions by engaging in two different types of
misclassification: craft misclassification and
independent contractor misclassification.
Craft misclassification occurs when dis-
honest contractors misclassify highskilled
workers as general laborers or lower wage
classifications in order to avoid paying the
higher prevailing wage rate applicable to the
high-skilled work actually performed. Inde-
pendent contractor misclassification occurs
when contractors misclassify employees as
independent contractors to avoid paying pre-
vailing wages in order to reduce labor costs
and avoid state and federal taxes.

H5692 July 11, 2019
These practices deny workers access to
critical benefits and protections, including pre-
vailing wages, workers’ compensation and un-
employment insurance, and communities suf-
fer because misclassification results in lower
tax revenues for federal, state, and local gov-
ernments. To top it off, the work is often sub-
standard as it has been performed by people
not properly trained for the job.
Our military installations deserve quality
workmanship, not substandard facilities that
could create potential hazards and diminish
readiness.
In light of the intended federal investment of
$11.5 billion for military construction projects
included in this underlying bill for fiscal year
2020, we need to be sure that our taxpayer
dollars—and critical investment in military in-
frastructure—are being spent in accordance
with the law and on qualified workmanship.
The GAO investigation of the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers will help quantify the problem
and hopefully usher in reform.
Mr. SOTO. Madam Chair, I would like to ac-
knowledge that my amendment, floor amend-
ment number 357, rules amendment number
117, included in en bloc package number 14,
increases funding for the Defense-Wide Manu-
facturing Science and Technology program by
$5 million for anti-tamper heterogeneous inte-
grated microelectronics.
Microelectronics support nearly all Depart-
ment of Defense activities, enabling capabili-
ties such as the global position system, radar,
command and control, and communications.
Ensuring secure access to leading-edge
microelectronics, however, is a challenge. The
changing global semiconductor industry and
the sophistication of U.S. adversaries, who
might target military electronic components,
require us to update our domestic microelec-
tronics security framework.
Defense-Wide Manufacturing Science and
Technology is an investment mechanism that
allows the Department of Defense to advance
state-of-the-art, defense-essential, manufac-
turing capabilities through the development of
technologies and processes necessary to
produce defense systems. This amendment
would provide additional funding resources,
through the use of a public-private-partnership
structured microelectronics cybersecurity cen-
ter, to support anti-tamper devices, hardware
security, and other evolving new concept tech-
nologies that support trusted and assured
manufacturing, combined with advanced sys-
tem integration and packaging technologies.
I support the rapid modernization of domes-
tic state-of-the-art foundry operations that
produce trusted microelectronics and thank
the Chairman and the Committee for all their
work on this amendment.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of my amendment to H.R. 2500,
which would require the Secretary of Defense
to submit a report to Congress regarding the
Department’s progress implementing the 91
priority recommendations from the Comptroller
General of the United States. I would like to
thank my colleague Congresswoman BARBARA
LEE for cosponsoring this amendment. I would
also like to thank Chairman SMITH and the
House Armed Services Committee for their
work on this important legislation.
The 91 priority recommendations in GAO–
19–366SP report was sent to the Department
of Defense to address major challenges in
nine key areas: Acquisitions and Contract
Management, Readiness, Building Capacity to
Drive Enterprise-Wide Business Reform, De-
fense Headquarters, Health care, Cybersecu-
rity, Infrastructure, Financial Management, and
Preventing Sexual Harassment. These rec-
ommendations address challenges that affect
the Department’s ability to accomplish its mis-
sion.
Every Congressional Black Caucus alter-
native budget for the past decade has made
implementing GAO’s recommendations a pri-
ority to encourage DoD to save taxpayer dol-
lars and to be more prudent with the enor-
mous amount of resources they are provided
to defend our country. As we work to strength-
en our nation’s Armed Forces to counter
threats from our adversaries, we must ensure
that DoD roots out waste, fraud, and abuse
within the agency. While DoD has successfully
implemented some of the recommendations
made by the GAO, there is more work to be
done.
Today, DoD faces new challenges in our
national security with the rise of cyber crimes,
international terrorism and nuclear threats. Our
military has been stretched and exhausted
from being involved in two wars in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. We should be doing everything we
can to ensure that DoD funds are used to
strengthen our national security.
Each fiscal year, the Department is appro-
priated hundreds of billions of dollars and is
the largest employer in the federal govern-
ment. It is critical that DOD accounts for every
dollar. The GAO report has 17 recommenda-
tions for financial management. GAO reports
that DoD has failed to properly produce cor-
rect financial information. This is a serious
problem for a Department that receives such
a significant share of federal taxpayer dollars.
Auditing the Pentagon and encouraging DoD
to continue to implement the remaining GAO
recommendations would lead to tens of bil-
lions in cost savings for taxpayers by bringing
a culture of financial accountability to the Pen-
tagon.
Madam Chair, it is imperative that DoD ad-
dress and implement the GAO’s remaining pri-
ority recommendations. If cost is the issue that
is preventing the implementation, the required
report to Congress will outline the estimated
funding needed to assist DOD with the imple-
mentation.
I hope my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting this important amendment to ensure
DoD’s efficient use of taxpayer dollars.

AMENDMENT NO. 394 OFFERED BY MRS.
WALORSKI OF INDIANA
Page 733, after line 15, insert the following
new section:
SEC. 1092. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING
MILITARY WORKING DOGS AND SOL-
DIER HANDLERS.
(a) CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.—The Con-
gress finds that—
(1) the 341st Training Squadron, 37th Train-
ing Wing at Lackland Air Force Base pro-
vides highly trained military working dogs
to the Department of Defense and other gov-
ernment agencies;
(2) in 2010, the operational needs of the
Army for military working dogs increased
without an increase in resources to train a
sufficient number of dogs for the detection of
improvised explosive devices at the 341st
Training Squadron;
(3) the Army initiated the tactical explo-
sive detection dog program in August 2010 as
a nontraditional military working dog pro-
gram to train and field improvised explosive
device detection dogs for use in Afghanistan
as part of Operation Enduring Freedom;
(4) the tactical explosive detection dog pro-
gram was created to reduce casualties from
improvised explosive devices in response to
an increase in the use of asymmetric weap-
ons by the enemy;
(5) the tactical explosive detection dogs
were a unique subset of military working
dogs because the Army selected and trained
soldiers from deploying units to serve as
temporary handlers for only the duration of
deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom;
(6) the tactical explosive detection dogs
and their soldier handlers, like other mili-
tary working dog and handler teams, formed
strong bonds while training for combat and
performing extremely dangerous improvised
explosive device detection missions in serv-
ice to the United States;
(7) the tactical explosive detection dog pro-
gram was a nontraditional military working
dog program that terminated in February
2014;
(8) at the termination of the tactical explo-
sive detection dog program in February 2014,
neither United States law nor Department of
Defense policy established an adoption order
priority, and Department of Defense policy
only provided that military working dogs be
adopted by former handlers, law enforcement
agencies, and other persons capable of hu-
manely caring for the animals;
(9) an August 2016 report to Congress by
the Air Force entitled ‘‘Tactical Explosive
Detector Dog (TEDD) Adoption Report’’ con-
cluded that the Army had a limited transi-
tion window for the disposition of tactical
explosive detection dogs and the lack of a
formal comprehensive plan contributed to
the disorganized disposition process for the
tactical explosive detection dogs;
(10) the August 2016 report stated that, in
2014, the Army disposed of 229 tactical explo-
sive detection dogs;
(11) 40 tactical explosive detection dogs
were adopted by handlers, 47 dogs were
adopted by private individuals, 70 dogs were
transferred to Army units, 17 dogs were
transferred to other government agencies, 46
dogs were transferred to law enforcement
agencies, and 9 dogs were deceased;
(12) the disposition of tactical explosive de-
tection dogs was poorly executed, proper pro-
cedures outlined in Department of Defense
policy were ignored, and, as a result, the
former soldier handlers were not provided
the opportunity to adopt their tactical ex-
plosive detection dogs;
(13) the Army should have deliberately
planned for the disposition of the tactical ex-
plosive detection dogs and provided appro-
priate time to review and consider adoption
applications to mitigate handler and civilian
adoption issues;
(14) section 342(b) of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Pub-
lic Law 114–92; 129 Stat. 793) amended section
2583(c) of title 10, United States Code, to
modify the list of persons authorized to
adopt a military animal and prioritize the
list with preference, respectively, to former
handlers, other persons capable of humanely
caring for the animal, and law enforcement
agencies;
(15) since 2000, Congress has passed legisla-
tion that protects military working dogs,
promotes their welfare, and recognizes the
needs of their veteran handlers;
(16) Congress continues to provide over-
sight of military working dogs to prevent a
reoccurrence of the disposition issues that
affected tactical explosive detection dogs;
(17) former soldier handlers should be re-
united with their tactical explosive detec-
tion dogs;
(18) congressional recognition of the mili-
tary service of tactical explosive detection
dogs and their former soldier handlers is a
small measure of gratitude this legislative
body can convey;
(19) over 4 years have passed since the ter-
mination of the tactical explosive detection
dog program;
(20) Congressman Walter B. Jones has been
a long-time advocate for military working
dogs and their handlers;
(21) Congressman Walter B. Jones has
worked to ensure that handlers are given pri-
ority when their military working dogs
reach retirement;
(22) Congressman Walter B. Jones was a
strong proponent of the Wounded Warrior
Service Dog program, which is a valuable
program that helps wounded members of the
Armed Forces manage and recover from
post-traumatic stress;
(23) the advocacy of Congressman Walter
B. Jones for military working dogs is well
known throughout the nonprofit community
that supports military working dogs;
(24) Congressman Walter B. Jones worked
with the Department of Defense and the Sen-
ate to update the language in the Air Force
Manual on Military Working Dogs to clarify
that military working dogs are not equip-
ment and to indicates the true level of appre-
ciation and respect the Department of De-
fense has for these valuable members of the
military team;
(25) Congressman Walter B. Jones was the
chief legislative sponsor of the Military
Working Dog Teams Monument, which was
built with no taxpayer dollars but through
corporate and private donations; and
(26) with the support of Congressman Wal-
ter B. Jones, the National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law
110–181) authorized the Burnam Foundation
to design, fund, build, and maintain the Mili-
tary Working Dog Teams National Monu-
ment.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress to—
(1) recognize the efforts of Congressman
Walter B. Jones to promote military work-
ing dogs as unsung heroes on the battlefield
and in helping wounded warriors recover
from physical and mental injuries;
(2) recognize the service of military work-
ing dogs and soldier handlers from the tac-
tical explosive detection dog program;
(3) acknowledge that not all tactical explo-
sive detection dogs were adopted by their
former soldier handlers;
(4) encourage the Army and other govern-
ment agencies, including law enforcement
agencies, with former tactical explosive de-
tection dogs to prioritize adoption to former
tactical explosive detection dog handlers;
and
(5) honor the sacrifices made by tactical
explosive detection dogs and their soldier
handlers in combat.

At the end of subtitle G of title X, insert
the following:
SEC. 10ll. PLAN TO INCREASE AND EXPAND
COLD WEATHER TRAINING.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The strategic importance of the Arctic
continues to increase as the United States
and other countries recognize the military
and economic importance of the region.
However, the operational capabilities of the
United States Armed Forces in extreme cold
weather or Arctic environments have atro-
phied when compared to regional adver-
saries.
(2) The 2018 national defense strategy stat-
ed ‘‘The central challenge to U.S. prosperity
and security is the reemergence of long-
term, strategic competition by what the Na-
tional Security Strategy classifies as revi-
sionist powers.’’
(3) The Government of the Russian
Federation–
(A) has made significant military invest-
ments in the Arctic, including the creation
of an Arctic Command, the Northern Fleet
Joint Strategic Command;
(B) has emplaced an Air Defense Missile
Regiment throughout the Arctic;
(C) has invested in the construction or re-
furbishment of 16 deepwater ports and 14 air-
fields in the region and has conducted sig-
nificant military exercises.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that the Arctic is a region of stra-
tegic importance to the national security in-
terests of the United States and the Depart-
ment of the Army must increase and expand
its cold weather training capabilities to en-
sure that United States Armed Forces can
operate in Arctic conditions necessary to
compete against a near peer adversary and
to execute the national defense strategy of
the United States.
(c) ASSESSMENT REQUIRED.—The Secretary
of the Army shall—
(1) conduct an assessment of cold weather
training requirements in light of increased
operations and vulnerability to great power
competition in the Arctic; and
(2) develop a plan to increase and expand
cold weather training opportunities.
(d) ELEMENTS.—In conducting the assess-
ment and developing the plan as required
under subsection (c), the Secretary shall—
(1) assess all existing cold weather training
requirements to include requirements for ex-
treme cold, or Arctic conditions;
(2) identify capability gaps in confronting
adversaries in the Arctic that can be ad-
dressed by increased and improved training;
(3) make recommendations for strength-
ening and improving those training require-
ments and mitigation measures needed to
address the capabilities gaps necessary to
confront adversaries;
(4) assess existing cold weather training
sites;
(5) consider steps necessary to increase
student capacity at such sites;
(6) consider manpower and supply require-
ments, including cadre needed to support in-
creased student capacity; and
(7) address any other matters the Sec-
retary of the Army considers relevant.
(e) SUBMITTAL TO CONGRESS.—Not later
than 180 days after the date of the enactment
of this Act, the Secretary of the Army shall
submit to the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives the plan required by subsection
(c).
AMENDMENT NO. 407 OFFERED BY MR. YOUNG OF
ALASKA
At the end of subtitle E of title XII, add
the following:
SEC. l. CHINESE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT
IN COUNTRIES OF THE ARCTIC RE-
GION.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) China is projecting a physical presence
in the Arctic through upgrading to advanced
icebreakers, utilizing the Arctic Ocean more
regularly through subsidizing arctic ship-
ping, deploying unmanned ice stations, and
engaging in large and sophisticated data col-
lection efforts in countries of the Arctic re-
gion, including Iceland, Greenland, and Can-
ada.
(2) The 2017 Center for Naval Analysis
(CNA) report ‘‘Unconstrained Foreign Direct
Investment: An Emerging Challenge to Arc-
tic Security’’ concluded that China has been
actively engaged in economies of countries
of the Arctic region.
(3) The CNA report documented a pattern
of strategic investment by China in the
economies of countries of the Arctic region,
including the United States, Canada, Green-
land, Iceland, Norway, and Russia, in areas
such as raw land, oil and gas, minerals, and
infrastructure.
(4) Chinese investments in countries of the
Arctic region are significant. For instance,
Chinese foreign direct investment con-
stituted nearly 12 percent of Greenland’s
gross domestic product for the period from
2012 to 2017.
(5) China’s 2018 Arctic Policy White Paper
documented the Chinese intent to create a
‘‘Polar Silk Road’’ in the Arctic.
(6) China’s ‘‘Polar Silk Road’’ is an exten-
sion of China’s Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI).
(7) China is increasingly using the BRI as
the impetus for increasing People’s Libera-
tion Army deployments to regions where
China has significant investments, primarily
through BRI.
(8) China has demonstrated an interest in
using BRI to gain military access to stra-
tegic regions.
(9) Understanding how China’s foreign di-
rect investment in countries of the Arctic re-
gion affects such countries is critical to un-
derstanding the degree to which China is
able to access the region.
(b) INDEPENDENT STUDY.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 45 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, the
Secretary of Defense shall seek to enter into
a contract with a federally-funded research
and development center described in para-
graph (2) to complete an independent study
of Chinese foreign direct investment in coun-
tries of the Arctic region, with a focus on the
effects of such foreign direct investment on
United States national security and near-
peer competition in the Arctic region.
(2) FEDERALLY-FUNDED RESEARCH AND DE-
VELOPMENT CENTER DESCRIBED.—A federally-
funded research and development center de-
scribed in this paragraph is a federally-fund-
ed research and development center that—
(A) has access to relevant data and dem-
onstrated data-sets regarding foreign direct
investment in the Arctic region; and
(B) has access to policy experts throughout
the United States and the Arctic region.
(c) ELEMENTS.—The study required by sub-
section (b) shall include the following:
(1) Projects in the Arctic that are directly
or indirectly funded by public and private
Chinese entities, to—
(A) build public infrastructure;
(B) finance of infrastructure;
(C) lease mineral and oil and gas leases;
(D) purchase real estate;
(E) extract or process, including smelting,
minerals and oil and gas;
(F) engage in shipping or to own and oper-
ate or construct shipping infrastructure, in-
cluding ship construction;
(G) lay undersea cables; and
(H) manufacture, own or operate tele-
communications capabilities and infrastruc-
ture.
(2) An analysis the legal environment in
which Chinese foreign direct investment are
occurring in the United States, Russia, Can-
ada, Greenland, Norway, and Iceland. The
analysis should include—

respect to its relations with the United
States and Russia, including the degree to
which activities of China in the region are an
extension of China’s strategic competition
with the United States.
(C) Whether any active or planned infra-
structure investments are likely to result in
a regular presence of Chinese military ves-
sels or the establishment of military bases in
the Arctic region.

states are susceptible to the political and
economic risks of unregulated foreign direct
investment.
(F) The vulnerability of semi-autonomous
regions, such as tribal lands, to Chinese for-
eign direct investment, including the influ-
ence of legal controls and political or eco-
nomic manipulation with respect to such
vulnerability.
(G) The implications of China’s Arctic de-
velopment and participation model with re-
spect to forecasting China’s military, econ-
omy, territorial, and political activities.
(6) Policy and legislative recommendations
to enhance the position of the United States
in affairs of the Arctic region, including—

at China Lake, California;
(iii) the essential research, development,
test, and evaluation missions conducted at
Edwards Air Force Base and Naval Air Weap-
ons Station China Lake, along with the crit-
ical combat preparation training conducted
at Fort Irwin, make these installations vital
cornerstones within our National Defense ar-
chitecture integrating all operational do-
mains, air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace;
(iv) any damage to these military installa-
tions caused by the earthquakes and the neg-
ative impact on the installations’ missions
as a result are a cause for concern;
(v) the proud men and women, both in uni-
form and their civilian counterparts, who
work at these military installations develop,
test, and evaluate the best tools and impart
the training needed for our warfighters, so
that our military remains second to none;
(vi) in light of the earthquakes in July
2019, the Secretary of Defense should repro-
gram or marshal, to the fullest extent the
law allows, all available resources that are
necessary and appropriate to ensure—
(I) the safety and security of the base em-
ployees, both civilian and those in uniform,
including those who have been evacuated;
(II) the bases are mission capable; and
(III) that all the damage caused by any
earthquake is repaired and improved as expe-
ditiously as possible.

AMENDMENT NO. 420 OFFERED BY MR. ROSE OF
NEW YORK
At the end of division A, add the following:
TITLE XVII—SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT
TO FOREIGN TRAFFICKERS OF ILLICIT
SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS
SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Fentanyl
Sanctions Act’’.
SEC. 1702. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention estimate that from September
2017 through September 2018 more than 48,200
people in the United States died from an
opioid overdose, with synthetic opioids (ex-
cluding methadone), contributing to a record
31,900 overdose deaths. While drug overdose
death estimates from methadone, semi-syn-
thetic opioids, and heroin have decreased in
recent months, overdose deaths from syn-
thetic opioids have continued to increase.
(2) Congress and the President have taken
a number of actions to combat the demand
for illicit opioids in the United States, in-
cluding enacting into law the SUPPORT for
Patients and Communities Act (Public Law
115–271; 132 Stat. 3894). While new statutes
and regulations have reduced the rate of
opioid prescriptions in recent years, fully ad-
dressing the United States opioid crisis will
involve dramatically restricting the foreign
supply of illicit opioids.
(3) The People’s Republic of China is the
world’s largest producer of illicit fentanyl,
fentanyl analogues, and their immediate pre-
cursors. From the People’s Republic of
China, those substances are shipped pri-
marily through express consignment carriers
or international mail directly to the United
States, or, alternatively, shipped directly to
transnational criminal organizations in Mex-
ico, Canada, and the Caribbean.
(4) The United States and the People’s Re-
public of China, Mexico, and Canada have
made important strides in combating the il-
licit flow of opioids through bilateral efforts
of their respective law enforcement agencies.
(5) The objective of preventing the pro-
liferation of illicit opioids though existing
multilateral and bilateral initiatives re-
quires additional efforts to deny illicit ac-
tors the financial means to sustain their
markets and distribution networks.
(6) The implementation on May 1, 2019, of
the regulations of the People’s Republic of
China to schedule all fentanyl analogues as
controlled substances is a major step in com-
bating global opioid trafficking and rep-
resents a major achievement in United
States-China law enforcement dialogues.
However, that step will effectively fulfill the
commitment that President Xi Jinping of
the People’s Republic of China made to
President Donald Trump at the Group of
Twenty meeting in December 2018 only if the
Government of the People’s Republic of
China devotes sufficient resources to full im-
plementation and strict enforcement of the
new regulations. The effective enforcement
of the new regulations should result in di-
minished trafficking of illicit fentanyl origi-
nating from the People’s Republic of China
into the United States.
(7) While the Department of the Treasury
used the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designa-
tion Act (21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) to sanction
the first synthetic opioid trafficking entity
in April 2018, additional economic and finan-
cial sanctions policy tools are needed to help
combat the flow of synthetic opioids into the
United States.
SEC. 1703. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the United States should apply eco-
nomic and other financial sanctions to for-
eign traffickers of illicit opioids to protect
the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States and the health
of the people of the United States;
(2) it is imperative that the People’s Re-
public of China follow through on full imple-
mentation of the new regulations, adopted
May 1, 2019, to treat all fentanyl analogues
as controlled substances under the laws of
the People’s Republic of China, including by
devoting sufficient resources for implemen-
tation and strict enforcement of the new reg-
ulations; and
(3) the effective enforcement of the new
regulations should result in diminished traf-
ficking of illicit fentanyl originating from
the People’s Republic of China into the
United States.

(1) the President should instruct the Sec-
retary of State to commence immediately
diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate inter-
national fora such as the United Nations, the
Group of Seven, the Group of Twenty, and
trilaterally and bilaterally with partners of
the United States, to combat foreign opioid
trafficking, including by working to estab-
lish a multilateral sanctions regime with re-
spect to foreign opioid trafficking; and

with the Secretary of the Treasury, should
intensify efforts to maintain and strengthen
the coalition of countries formed to combat
foreign opioid trafficking.

AMENDMENT NO. 422 OFFERED BY MR. BARR OF
KENTUCKY
At the end of title X, add the following:
Subtitle I—North Korea Nuclear Sanctions
SEC. 1092. SHORT TITLE.
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Otto
Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions
Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 1093. FINDINGS.
The Congress finds the following:
(1) On June 1, 2016, the Department of the
Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network announced a Notice of Finding that
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is
a jurisdiction of primary money laundering
concern due to its use of state-controlled fi-
nancial institutions and front companies to
support the proliferation and development of
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and bal-
listic missiles.
(2) The Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) has expressed serious concerns with
the threat posed by North Korea’s prolifera-
tion and financing of WMD, and has called on
FATF members to apply effective counter-
measures to protect their financial sectors
from North Korean money laundering, WMD
proliferation financing, and the financing of
terrorism.
(3) In its February 2017 report, the U.N.
Panel of Experts concluded that—
(A) North Korea continued to access the
international financial system in support of
illicit activities despite sanctions imposed
by U.N. Security Council Resolutions 2270
(2016) and 2321 (2016);
(B) during the reporting period, no member
state had reported taking actions to freeze
North Korean assets; and
(C) sanctions evasion by North Korea, com-
bined with inadequate compliance by mem-
ber states, had significantly negated the im-
pact of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
(4) In its September 2017 report, the U.N.
Panel of Experts found that—
(A) North Korea continued to violate fi-
nancial sanctions by using agents acting
abroad on the country’s behalf;
(B) foreign financial institutions provided
correspondent banking services to North Ko-
rean persons and front companies for illicit
purposes;
(C) foreign companies violated sanctions
by maintaining links with North Korean fi-
nancial institutions; and
(D) North Korea generated at least $270
million during the reporting period through
the violation of sectoral sanctions.
(5) North Korean entities engage in signifi-
cant financial transactions through foreign
bank accounts that are maintained by non-
North Korean nationals, thereby masking
account users’ identity in order to access fi-
nancial services.
(6) North Korea’s sixth nuclear test on Sep-
tember 3, 2017, demonstrated an estimated
explosive power more than 100 times greater
than that generated by its first nuclear test
in 2006.
(7) On February 23, 2018 the Department of
the Treasury announced its largest-ever set
of North Korea-related sanctions, with a par-
ticular focus on shipping and trading compa-
nies, and issued a maritime advisory to high-
light North Korea’s sanctions evasion tac-
tics. On May 9, 2019, the United States seized
a North Korean ship, the Wise Honest, which
had previously been detained by Indonesia
for carrying coal in violation of United Na-
tions sanctions.
(8) According to the March 2019 Final Re-
port of the U.N. Panel of Experts, ‘‘The nu-
clear and ballistic missile programmes of the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea re-
main intact and the country continues to
defy Security Council resolutions through a
massive increase in illegal ship-to-ship
transfers of petroleum products and coal.
These violations render the latest United Na-
tions sanctions ineffective by flouting the
caps on the import of petroleum products
and crude oil by the Democratic People’s Re-
public of Korea as well as the coal ban, im-
posed in 2017 by the Security Council in re-
sponse to the country’s unprecedented nu-
clear and ballistic missile testing.’’.
(9) The U.N. Panel of Experts further con-
cluded: ‘‘Financial sanctions remain some of
the most poorly implemented and actively
evaded measures of the sanctions regime. In-
dividuals empowered to act as extensions of
financial institutions of the Democratic Peo-
ple’s Republic of Korea operate in at least
five countries with seeming impunity.’’.
(10) North Korea has successfully tested
short-range, submarine-launched, and inter-
continental ballistic missiles, and is rapidly
progressing in its development of a nuclear-
armed missile that is capable of reaching
United States territory.

July 11, 2019
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. RUIZ).
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Chair, I rise in
support of my amendments to protect
our servicemembers from toxic smoke
exposure and move us closer to ending
the use of burn pits.
Burn pits are large fields where the
military burns waste, including bat-
teries, jet fuels, and medical waste,
causing our men and women in uniform
to inhale toxic chemicals, carcinogens,
and particulate matter. These haz-
ardous materials have been linked to
life-threatening cancers, lung diseases,
and rare illnesses.
Exposure to burn pits took the life of
Jennifer Kepner, a veteran and mother
of two from Cathedral City in my dis-
trict, who lost her life to pancreatic
cancer that her doctor believed was
most probably caused by her exposure
to burn pits.
Jennifer’s story has become all too
common. As a physician and a public
health expert, I know that, when there
is a high enough suspicion of harm that
causes a severe enough illness, we must
act.
As the co-chairman of the bipartisan
Burn Pits Caucus, I am working to end
the use of burn pits, educate doctors
and veterans about their health effects,
get exposed veterans the healthcare
and benefits that they have earned and
need and deserve, and do more research
on the health effects of burn pit expo-
sure.
Madam Chair, my amendments will
require the Department of Defense to
conduct an implementation plan to end
the use of nine active burn pits con-
tinuing to threaten the health of our
servicemembers stationed overseas.
In addition, my amendments will re-
quire DOD to provide a list of all loca-
tions where open-air burn pits have
been used and report to Congress on its
research assessing their health effects.
Finally, my amendments require the
Department of Defense to train doctors
on the potential health effects of burn
pits, helping them catch the early
warning signs of serious life-threat-
ening illnesses before it is too late.
I would like to thank Congressman
PETER WELCH for his support and com-
mitment to protecting the health of
our servicemembers and veterans, and I
urge my fellow Representatives on
both sides of the aisle to support these
critical amendments.
As Jennifer Kepner said to me before
she died:
Burn pits are the Agent Orange of our gen-
eration. We must take action before more
veterans and servicemembers lose their
lives.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
have no speakers at this time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON).
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding me time.
My amendment, No. 401, would exam-
ine the feasibility of piloting a work-
force transition program for Active-
Duty servicemen and -women who are
currently in counterintelligence roles
to give them the opportunity to obtain
additional security clearance creden-
tials upon their separation from serv-
ice.
A problem that many servicemem-
bers in counterintelligence face upon
separation from the military is that
they are unable to transition their se-
curity clearances to be eligible to start
work immediately for, or in support of,
a Federal intelligence agency.
The wait time to transition a secu-
rity clearance can take over a year,
and many of these individuals are
forced to consider taking a lower pay-
ing job while they wait for the process
to move forward, or we lose these indi-
viduals entirely when they take jobs in
the private sector outside the intel-
ligence community.
These are members serving in roles
that are in critical needs areas for our
intelligence areas, such as cyberspace
operations, cyber electronic warfare,
and military intelligence.
Because of these difficulties, our in-
telligence agencies are losing out on a
highly qualified and diverse talent pool
whose skills and training have already
been paid for by the Federal Govern-
ment.
Madam Chair, my amendment would
help ensure that those veterans who
have service in our military’s intel-
ligence fields, can continue to use their
abilities to protect our Nation well be-
yond their military service.

AMENDMENT NO. 217 OFFERED BY MR. KHANNA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 217 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Add at the end of subtitle E of title XII the
following:
SEC. 12ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NORTH
KOREA.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) diplomacy is essential to address the il-
legal nuclear program of North Korea;
(2) every effort should be made to avoid a
military confrontation with North Korea, as
it would pose extreme risks to—
(A) United States military personnel;
(B) noncombatants, including United
States citizens and citizens of United States
allies; and
(C) regional security;
(3) the United States should pursue a sus-
tained and credible diplomatic process to
achieve the denuclearization of North Korea
and an end to the 69-year-long Korean War;
and
(4) until such time as North Korea no
longer poses a threat to the United States or
United States allies, the United States
should, in concert with such allies, continue
to deter North Korea through credible de-
fense and deterrence posture.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from California (Mr. KHANNA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, this
amendment is an historic effort of bi-
partisan spirit to finally have peace
with North Korea after over 69 years of
conflict.
Regardless of whoever is President,
diplomacy is the key to the region.
The Congressional Research Service
tells us that, in the first few minutes of
any war in North Korea, as many as
500,000 civilians could perish, many of
them Americans. And, if the conflict
went nuclear, millions would perish.
No one has done more for peace in
the subcontinent, in North Korea, than
President Carter. President Carter
went and met with Kim Jong Un’s
grandfather in 1994 and came up with a
framework for denuclearization. He re-
cently had a constructive conversation
with President Trump, and President
Trump has taken efforts to seek dia-
logue there.
I believe that we can have a three-
part framework to reaching such an
agreement that President Carter had
outlined with Kim Jong Un’s grand-
father.
First, we need to have a nonaggres-
sion pact to assure the North Koreans
that we do not have any interest in re-
gime change and have a permanent
peace. I believe, if we do that, Kim
Jong Un will engage in significant
denuclearization.
And we should have no relaxation of
any sanctions until there is at least 90
percent denuclearization, which is
achievable. And, after the
denuclearization, we can have flexible
sanctions with clapback provisions.
The point is, this doesn’t have to be
partisan. It is in our Nation’s interest
to seek peace. I, for one, will support
the administration’s efforts to seek
peace, and I appreciate that this House,
in a bipartisan way, will go on record
saying that we need a permanent peace
agreement with North Korea.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. KHANNA).
The amendment was agreed to.
The Acting CHAIR. The Chair under-
stands that amendment No. 368 will not
be offered.

AMENDMENT NO. 375 OFFERED BY MR. TIPTON
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 375 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle J of title V, add the
following:
SEC. 597. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE
HIGH-ALTITUDE ARMY NATIONAL
GUARD AVIATION TRAINING SITE.
(a) FINDING.—Congress finds that the High-
Altitude Army National Guard Aviation
Training Site is the lone school of the De-
partment of Defense where rotary-wing avi-
ators in the Armed Forces and the militaries
of foreign allies learn how to safely fly ro-
tary-wing aircraft in mountainous, high-alti-
tude environments.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that military aviation training in
Colorado, including the training conducted
at the High-Altitude Army National Guard
Aviation Training Site, is critical to the na-
tional security of the United States and the
readiness of the Armed Forces.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado.
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Chair, I yield to
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.
LAMBORN).
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding and
for his leadership on this important
issue.
Just so everyone will know, HAATS
stands for the High-Altitude Army
Aviation Training Site. There is only
one such site in the United States, and
that is in the mountains of western
Colorado, and it happens to be in Rep-
resentative TIPTON’s district.
A lot of the people who train there
with rotary aircraft come from Fort
Carson, which is in my district. I know
there is interest from other members of
the Colorado delegation. They have had
legislation that would designate near-
by areas, or even that area, as a wilder-
ness site.
But I want to talk about the impor-
tance of this to the Army. This is high-
altitude training. So, for rotary wing
pilots who are going to be going to
places like Afghanistan, this is a
unique training opportunity.
The high altitude, the change of
weather, the mountainous conditions,
and the valleys and hills and mountain
peaks really make for an amazing
training experience. And it has saved
lives.
I know Representative TIPTON is
going to have one story. I will give an-
other.
Just in this last couple of months, a
couple of skiers from Vail were lost,
and there was a search and rescue ef-
fort that was undertaken. With the
help of helicopter pilots who had been
trained, who were in the Army Na-
tional Guard, I believe, they were able
to find those skiers and rescue them
without loss of life or injury, even, and
it was a great success story.
That high-altitude training site has
led to many lives being saved, so it is
an asset for our country. It is a gem; it
is a jewel; and it must be protected at
all costs.
Madam Chair, I appreciate Rep-
resentative TIPTON’s leadership on this
issue.
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Chair, I do have
the privilege and the honor to be able
to represent Colorado’s vast Third Con-
gressional District, which is home to
the High-Altitude Army National
Guard Aviation Training Site, also
known as HAATS. It is located in Gyp-
sum, Colorado.
HAATS is under the U.S. Department
of Defense’s organization, and it is a
lone school that teaches rotary wing
aviators in the Armed Forces, in the
military, and also those of our foreign
allies to learn how to be able to fly
safely with rotary wing aircraft in
mountainous, high-altitude environ-
ments.
I have had the opportunity to be able
to hear from military officials and
many servicemen and -women, both re-
tired and active, along with their fami-
lies, who praise the lifesaving training
conducted at HAATS.
There are numerous examples of how
the elite training provided at HAATS
has benefited our men and women in
uniform when it comes to military
aviation. I would like to share one of
those examples this evening.
In Afghanistan’s Helmand province, a
HAATS graduate conducting an emer-
gency medical evacuation mission in
treacherous conditions was faced with
the challenge of dealing with fine
brown talcum powder, which was dam-
aging the engine’s aircraft. He was
able, through his training in manage-
ment power techniques garnered at
HAATS, to actually safely land the air-
craft and successfully remove wounded
soldiers and medics out of the area,
which was extremely hazardous.
Madam Chair, my amendment is a
sense of Congress whereby Congress
recognizes that the military aviation
training in Colorado, including the
training conducted at HAATS, is crit-
ical to the national security of the
United States and to the readiness of
the Armed Forces.
Madam Chair, I encourage all of my
colleagues to support this amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, while I
do not oppose the amendment, I would
like to take advantage of the time in
opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Colorado is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I appre-
ciate that my colleague from the Third
Congressional District, Mr. TIPTON, is
highlighting a program that is so deep-
ly valued by the entire Colorado dele-
gation, myself included.
HAATS, as was just mentioned, of-
fers unique training for rotary wing pi-
lots in power management at high alti-
tudes. It is the only Department of De-
fense aviation school that teaches pi-
lots this skill outside of the classroom.
Students come from all over the world
to receive this incredible training.
As more skiers, hikers, and rock
climbers visit Colorado, there are more
instances where outdoor enthusiasts
may need to be rescued and evacuated.
And, because of the work done at
HAATS, evacuations can happen in
some of the most unforgiving terrain
on Earth.
Of course, as my distinguished col-
league mentioned, HAATS also pro-
vides the training for our military avi-
ators to simulate real-world combat
scenarios to be prepared to support our
men and women in uniform.
I know I speak for the entire Colo-
rado delegation when I say that the
work done at HAATS is critically im-
portant, and we are proud to have such
a renowned training facility
headquartered in Colorado in the Third
Congressional District, as my colleague
mentioned, which borders my own
beautiful congressional district, the
Second.
It is also for those reasons I would
just say that I do believe it is impor-
tant, as cosponsors of wilderness legis-
lation, that we work to ensure that the
bills that we pursue don’t adversely af-
fect current or future military transit
and training in Colorado.
I would like to address the comment
made by my colleague from Colorado
Springs, the distinguished gentleman,
to say that the good news is my bill
that I have introduced, the CORE Act,
with Senator BENNET does not ad-
versely affect current or future mili-
tary transit and training in Colorado,
nor does it impact HAATS.
Years have been spent working con-
structively with representatives from
the Colorado National Guard, HAATS,
the Office of the Secretary of Defense,
the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, the
FAA, and relevant land management
agencies to ensure that that bill in par-
ticular would allow for continued and
future military training and transit in
Colorado, so that is why I am excited
that that bill is making its way to the
floor.
Again, I appreciate my colleague’s
dedication to ensuring that the mission
of HAATS is protected. I certainly
share that dedication, and I look for-
ward to continuing to support this pro-
gram that brings so much pride to our
State, alongside my colleague, Mr. TIP-
TON.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Chair, I appre-
ciate the kind comments from my col-
league out of Colorado in support of
something that is fundamentally im-
portant to our Nation’s security and
also to be able to help citizens who
may be in treacherous conditions in
the high altitudes of Colorado and our
other Western States.

AMENDMENT NO. 386 OFFERED BY MR. TURNER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 386 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. TURNER. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Strike section 1646 and insert the following
new section:
SEC. 1646. CERTIFICATION REGARDING DEPLOY-
MENT OF LOW-YIELD BALLISTIC MIS-
SILE WARHEAD.
Not later than 90 days after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of De-
fense shall certify to the congressional de-
fense committees whether—
(1) the Secretary determines that the de-
ployment of low-yield ballistic missile war-
heads is in the best interests of the national
security of the United States; and
(2) the Secretary has an alternative to the
W76–2 low-yield ballistic missile warhead
that—
(A) may be deployed as of the date of the
certification; and
(B) provides at least the same level of pro-
portional response capability as the W76–2
low-yield ballistic missile warhead deployed
on submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. TURNER) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Ohio.
Mr. TURNER. Madam Chair, this is
an amendment that would strike sec-
tion 1646 of the bill and replace it with
a determination by the Secretary of
Defense as to a certification of need.
Madam Chair, this provision is a uni-
lateral nuclear disarmament provision.
Now, the chairman has said repeat-
edly this is not a unilateral nuclear
disarmament, but let’s break down
those words.
It is unilateral because it only ap-
plies to us. There is no one else. It is
nuclear because it applies to a nuclear
weapon. And it is disarmament because
it requires the pulling of a nuclear
weapon that is scheduled for deploy-
ment.
What we currently have in this bill is
a requirement that the W76–2, which is
a low-yield nuclear weapon that is cur-
rently headed for our submarines, be
pulled and not be deployed, a weapon
that our Department of Defense has de-
termined that we needed and, in fact,
last year, on a bipartisan basis, was
funded and approved for deployment.
But now we are going to reverse
course because now Congress is going
to decide, for unilateral nuclear disar-
mament, to reach out and start pulling
back nuclear weapons that are there to
defend us.
Let’s talk just for a moment as to
why we need this.
Russia has adopted a new nuclear
doctrine that is called escalate to dees-
calate. They actually believe that the
first use of nuclear weapons is some-
thing that can deescalate a fight as op-
posed to escalate it. They have de-
ployed low-yield nuclear weapons, and
they have even practiced scenarios
where they use low-yield believing
that, because we have, usually, larger
yield, bigger weapons, that we would be
less likely to respond.
In fact, the BBC did a documentary
where they began a scenario of an at-
tack by Russia against the United
States where it is a low-yield nuke
against one of our aircraft carriers, and
the assumption being we wouldn’t an-
swer back with a very large nuke.
The problem here that we have is
that this is a step to reduce our nu-
clear arsenal which is there for one
reason and one reason only, and that is
to deter our adversaries so that they
never think of using nuclear weapons.
This provision would take this uni-
lateral nuclear disarmament out. It
would put back in the bill a provision
that requires the Secretary of State to
determine that it is needed, and we
would instead look to their determina-
tion, not the random determination of
Congress.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I claim the time in opposition to
the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Washington is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.
First of all, if you were to say ‘‘uni-
lateral nuclear disarmament’’ to most
people, I think, if you look at the plain
language of the words, what that would
say is we are going to universally nu-
clear disarm all nuclear weapons. That
is what unilateral nuclear disar-
mament would mean. So that is not
what we are doing here.
Again, we literally have thousands of
nuclear weapons. What we are doing
here is trying to decide whether or not
we want to deploy one in a different
form, which is a smaller yield.
So we are not—let me assure my col-
leagues again—getting rid of all of our
nuclear weapons and unilaterally dis-
arming from nuclear weapons. We are
not doing that.
b 2045
This is one weapon with a small
yield.
The other thing that is worth noting;
there is actually no evidence that the
Russians have decided that they are
going to use a low-yield nuclear weap-
on first without any new clear provo-
cation.
I have had this debate with a number
of different people. There have been
various conversations about this; just
like we have had various conversations
about a wide range of scenarios. But it
is not at all clear that Russia has de-
cided to launch a nuclear weapon.
I believe that the purpose of a nu-
clear arsenal is deterrence; and we
ought to find a clear message. In fact,
I find this debate, which we have been
having for a while, very dangerous be-
cause what we are saying to the Rus-
sians is there is a scenario under which
they can use a nuclear weapon and we
won’t respond, and I don’t think that
should ever be true.
We should say a nuclear weapon is a
red line. You step across it, we will re-
spond.
It is also very untrue—this debate
has said, Well, gosh, if they do a low
yield, we have no option but to hit
them with something 10 times as large.
We have a wide range of yields on our
nuclear weapons, a wide range of op-
tions in terms of where and when we
could respond.
But what introducing a low-yield nu-
clear weapon does is we take the Rus-
sian mutterings about doing an esca-
late to de-escalate and say, yeah, we
are with you. This could happen.
Former Secretary of State George
Shultz, a Republican, is the one who
has been most critical of deployment of
this weapon, because, as he correctly
states, when we start talking about
low-yield nuclear weapons, you start
making nuclear war acceptable.
That is why deployment of this weap-
on is such a mistake. It takes us down
the road of saying, we can have a man-
ageable nuclear war. No. Make it clear
to the Russians, if they start a nuclear
war, we can’t promise that our re-
sponse is going to be proportional, but
we can promise that we will respond.
This is a mistake. But we are not
unilaterally nuclear disarming.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. TURNER. Madam Chair, this is
unilateral nuclear disarmament be-
cause we get nothing from the other
side. I mean, if you are against this nu-
clear weapon, put a provision in this
bill that says I strongly encourage the
United States to negotiate with Russia
that we both get rid of these nuclear
weapons.
I don’t like nuclear weapons. I am
just more concerned about the ones
that are in the hands of the other guys
than the ones that are in our hands.
Now, what is weird about this is that
the determination by the chairman
that we need to pull this weapon back
after, again, bipartisan support for this
weapon being deployed; is it because
this weapon is dangerous? No.
Is it because our adversaries have it?
Well, adversaries do have it.
Do we have it in other forms? Yes.
But yet, instead of those who are
charged with our military policy decid-
ing it, they want to decide it.

H5714 July 11, 2019
Now, again, this should be decided by
treaty. We should require that the
other side get rid of theirs if we are
going to get rid of ours.
But the other aspect is, this is not
just musings about Russia saying esca-
late to de-escalate. That is their nu-
clear weapons policy, and we have to be
very concerned as to how that policy
affects their calculus.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
MOULTON), a member of the committee.
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Chair, I rise
to oppose this amendment.
Now, I do not question my colleague
from Ohio’s commitment to our na-
tional security. He and I have worked
together on this committee for several
years.
But I do think that this amendment
would be a grave strategic mistake. I
oppose the development of these low-
yield weapons for three distinct rea-
sons:
One, they increase the chance of mis-
calculation by our enemies;
Two, they are a waste of taxpayer
money for a capability that we already
possess; and
Three, they weaken our national de-
fense as a consequence.
The fundamental strength of our nu-
clear deterrence lies in the fact that
our nuclear weapons are so catastroph-
ically damaging that nobody would
dare attack us or even threaten our al-
lies with a nuclear weapon.
Lowering the threshold for the use of
nuclear weapons by signaling to our
enemies that our response might not be
catastrophic for them makes it more
likely that our enemies will use nukes
against us and our allies in the first
place. It plays into Russia’s dangerous
new escalate to de-escalate doctrine.
Nobody should question the resolve
of the United States of America to re-
spond with overwhelming force if stra-
tegic weapons are used. Developing
these low-yield weapons does just that.
It questions that resolve, and that
weakens our national defense.
Mr. TURNER. Madam Chair, how
much time remains?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Ohio has 11⁄2 minutes remaining.
The gentleman from Washington has
11⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. TURNER. I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, if I may inquire, who has the
right to close on this one?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Washington has the right to
close.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I just have my close, so I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. TURNER. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
The provision that this amendment
seeks to modify in the bill is a provi-
sion that Vladimir Putin would love. I
can’t imagine what it must be like
when, in Moscow, they begin to tell
Vladimir Putin that the United States
Congress is looking to pass a law to
limit our nuclear weapons arsenal; that
we are going to look to pass a law to
actually remove weapons that are
scheduled for deployment; to remove
weapons that Russia has; to remove
weapons that are intended to change
Russia’s calculus, so that when they
look to threaten our country, they
know that we have the ability to re-
spond to both proportionately.
And it is not a new weapon. There are
other forms of low-yield nuclear weap-
ons that we have. It is just this one
that is being objected to.
By the way, the money has been
spent. This weapon is on its way. This
is not a destabilizing weapon. This is a
weapon that keeps us safe.
Now, the concern with this, of course,
once we begin unilateral nuclear disar-
mament—it is unilateral because we
get nothing for it. Our other side is
doing nothing. Nuclear because it is a
weapon; disarmament because we are
taking an armament out—is then when
do we stop?
If Congress decides to do this, that
we have the ability to just start pull-
ing weapons, then is the nuclear triad
at risk, Madam Chair?
Do we go pull our ICBMs?
Do we say that we shouldn’t have
this weapon or that weapon?
Shouldn’t we be looking to those who
actually have the expertise in under-
standing what our adversaries are
doing; what our strategy is; what our
nuclear weapons capabilities are and
our adversaries’ nuclear weapons capa-
bilities; how those compare; what their
procedures have been, and how they
have been deploying?
All those should figure in to the ex-
pertise, not random decisions to pull
nuclear weapons here on the Congres-
sional floor.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
There is nothing random about this
decision; and I do find the gentleman’s
argument interesting. I suppose Con-
gress should just sort of shut down and
say, Pentagon, whatever you want, you
have got. We are not going to say any-
thing about it.
I really disagree with that aspect of
the gentleman’s argument; that be-
cause the Pentagon has decided to de-
ploy this weapon, Congress should have
no say in it.
We are not doing this randomly. We
are not doing this arbitrarily. This is
actually a debate that has gone on for
a number of years as to whether or not
to deploy this weapon. I will grant you
there are arguments on both sides of it,
but the notion that we are like, on a
whim, making this decision is ridicu-
lous.
As I said, there are many former na-
tional security experts, including
former Secretary of State George
Shultz, who thinks that this weapon
will destabilize and make us less safe.
And let’s remember, we have had a
nuclear deterrent for almost 75 years
now. And for all of those 75 years, we
have not put a low-yield nuclear weap-
on on one of our submarines. We
haven’t done it. We have had a very
strong deterrent.
What I would say to Mr. Putin is, No,
we are not going to deploy every single
weapon system that we have ever
thought of because that wouldn’t be
very smart. But we have thousands of
nuclear weapons. And as Mr. MOULTON
said quite clearly, we need to make it
clear, we will have an overwhelming
response to any use of nuclear weap-
ons. That is what will deter them. That
is what will stop a nuclear war from

When we start to have that situation

The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-

The question was taken; and the Act-

peared to have it.
Mr. TURNER. Madam Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to

AMENDMENT NO. 423 OFFERED BY MR. KHANNA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 423 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle C of title XII, add
the following:
SEC. l. PROHIBITION OF UNAUTHORIZED MILI-
TARY FORCE IN OR AGAINST IRAN.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) The acquisition by the Government of
Iran of a nuclear weapon would pose a grave
threat to international peace and stability
and the national security of the United
States and United States allies, including
Israel.
(2) The Government of Iran is a leading
state sponsor of terrorism, continues to ma-
terially support the regime of Bashar al-
Assad, and is responsible for ongoing gross
violations of the human rights of the people
of Iran.
(3) Article I of the United States Constitu-
tion requires the President to obtain author-
ization from Congress before engaging in war
with Iran.
(b) CLARIFICATION OF CURRENT LAW.—Noth-
ing in the Authorization for Use of Military
Force (Public Law 107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541
note), the Authorization for Use of Military
Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public
Law 107–243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note), or any other
provision of law enacted before the date of
the enactment of this Act may be construed

to provide authorization for the use of mili-
tary force against Iran.
(c) PROHIBITION OF UNAUTHORIZED MILITARY
FORCE IN OR AGAINST IRAN.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in
paragraph (1), no Federal funds may be used
for any use of military force in or against
Iran unless Congress has—
(A) declared war; or
(B) enacted specific statutory authoriza-
tion for such use of military force after the
date of the enactment of this Act that meets
the requirements of the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.).
(2) EXCEPTION.—The prohibition under
paragraph (1) shall not apply to a use of mili-
tary force that is consistent with section
(2)(c) of the War Powers Resolution.
(d) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.—(1) Nothing
in this section may be construed to prevent
the President from using necessary and ap-
propriate force to defend United States allies
and partners if Congress enacts specific stat-
utory authorization for such use of force
consistent with the requirements of the War
Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.).
(2) Nothing in this Act may be construed
to relieve the executive branch of restric-
tions on the use of force, reporting, or con-
sultation requirements set forth in the War
Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.).
(3) Nothing in this Act may be construed
to authorize the use of military force.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentleman
from California (Mr. KHANNA) and a
Member opposed each will control 10
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, this
will be the most important foreign pol-
icy vote in the United States Congress.
This bipartisan amendment makes it
clear that the Congress appropriates
zero funding for any offensive war in
Iran or another war by choice.
The Supreme Court has made it clear
that when Congress limits funding for
a war, Congress’ power, not the execu-
tive power, is at its peak. And when
this amendment passes, it will be a
clear statement for Members of Con-
gress on both sides of the aisle that
this country is tired of endless wars;
that we do not want another war in the
Middle East.
I will make one final point before I
yield to my colleagues. The other side,
and people will argue, that this may
limit our ability to respond to an at-
tack on the United States or our allies.
That is a patent lie.
Nothing in this amendment limits
the President of the United States
from doing anything that he needs to
do to defend the United States of
America or our allies as he is author-
ized under the War Powers Act.
What this will prevent is another
trillion-dollar war in the Middle East.
Frankly, what it will prevent is what
this President promised the American
people not to do, to get into another
endless, costly war in the Middle East.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ),
the bipartisan cosponsor of the amend-
ment.
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and for our
work together on this issue.
Madam Chair, I represent the district
in this Congress that has the highest
concentration of active duty military.
If my constituents are called to war
with Iran, they will go without hesi-
tation or question. They will fight and
win decisive victory, and I am incred-
ibly proud of them.
But if they must deploy the patriot-
ism to go downrange and win this war,
we should at least have the courage to
vote for it or vote against it, every
darn one of us.
And if my war-hungry colleagues,
some of whom have already suggested
that we invade Venezuela, North
Korea, and probably a few other coun-
tries before lunchtime tomorrow; if
they are so certain of their case
against Iran, let them bring their au-
thorization to use military force
against Iran to this very floor.
Let them make the case to Congress
and to the American people. Let them
show the military families in my dis-
trict what their loved ones will fight
for and die for. If we do that, then I
think we serve the country well.
My constituents are doing their part,
and I think it is about time Congress
does our part and speak to these crit-
ical matters of war and peace.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 10 min-
utes.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), the distinguished
ranking member of the Foreign Affairs
Committee.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I rise in
strong opposition to this unfortunate
and dangerous amendment which is a
propaganda win for the Iranian regime
and the Houthi allies. It takes legiti-
mate options off the table; shows
America divided in the face of mount-
ing Iranian threats; and makes our Na-
tion less safe.
We all agree that, under Article I of
the Constitution, only Congress pos-
sesses the authority to declare war.
The administration’s measured re-
sponse to Iran’s shooting down of our
U.S. military asset in international
airspace shows that the President is
not looking for war with Iran.
But this amendment goes much far-
ther in prohibiting unauthorized war
with the number one state sponsor of
terror. It uses the power of the purse to
preclude any use of force whatsoever
against Iran unless it is previously au-
thorized by Congress or provoked by an
attack on the United States or our
Armed Forces.
b 2100
Think about what that means. What
can our military do if Iran attacks
American civilians or our regional al-
lies like Israel and Jordan or strategic
international shipping through the
Straits of Hormuz?
Under this reckless amendment, the
answer is: Absolutely nothing. The
U.S. military cannot fire a single shot
until after the successful completion of
a bicameral legislation process that en-
acts a law authorizing the use of force.
All of us here today know how long
that could take.
This will tie our military’s hands at
a perilous time. We need Iran and its
terrorist proxies to think twice before
they attack Americans, our friends, or
our interests.
This amendment is an unprecedented
attempt to micromanage the powers
claimed by every Commander in Chief,
Democrat and Republican, since the
War Powers Resolution was enacted
over President Nixon’s veto in 1973. In
fact, the effect of this misguided
amendment is far more restrictive than
the War Powers Resolution itself.
This is absolutely not the time to
play politics with our national secu-
rity. Iran’s saber rattling and provo-
cation is not going to go away anytime
soon.
I would like to quote from a July 8
letter from Acting Under Secretary of
Defense for Policy. He says:
The Department strongly opposes this
amendment. If U.S. citizens, diplomatic fa-
cilities in the region, or other national inter-
ests are threatened or attacked, we must be
able to respond promptly and in an appro-
priate fashion.
And he says:
At a time when Iran is engaging in esca-
lating military provocations demonstrated
most recently by the shooting down of the
U.S. unmanned aerial vehicle, it is attacking
allied shipping.
They shot a missile at our U.S. Em-
bassy in Iraq. This amendment could
only embolden Iran to further provo-
cations.
Bottom line, this amendment will
give comfort to our enemy who has the
blood of Americans on their hands—
from the Marine barracks bombing to
the Iraq war—and who continues to
hold American hostages to this day.
This is a pro-Iran, pro-Houthi amend-
ment.
I was in the White House when the
President made his decision and exer-
cised restraint to not escalate this war,
but this, I believe, is an ill-proposed
amendment.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, we are
going to have eight more speakers be-
cause this was such a collaborative ef-
fort, so I hope the speakers will limit
themselves to 1 minute or less so we
can get everyone in.
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. SMITH), our dis-
tinguished chair, who did more to bring
this amendment together than anyone.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, I want to make it absolutely
clear, in all the scenarios that the gen-
tleman on the other side just pointed
out, the President has the absolute
right of self-defense.
As Mr. KHANNA made clear in his
opening remarks, the right of self-de-
fense—if we were attacked in the way

that Congressman MCCAUL described,
the President has the absolute right to
defend the United States.
What this amendment says, basically
it is counter to the gentleman’s argu-
ment. The gentleman’s argument basi-
cally is that Congress should get out of
the way. Under no circumstances
should Congress have any say in the
use of the United States military.
I think that is wrong. I think we
have a role to play. The President
should not be allowed to start a war
anytime, anywhere, but he can abso-
lutely defend the United States in ac-
cordance with the War Powers Resolu-
tion.
All this says, that if it isn’t a matter
of self-defense, if the President has de-
cided, as we decided in Iraq, that we
are going to launch a war for preemp-
tive reasons or because of many of the
things the gentleman pointed out that
Iran does, if we are going to start a war
because of that, then we in the United
States Congress should uphold our con-
stitutional duty and have the right to
vote on it. I think that is appropriate.
Unless Members are in favor of Con-
gress getting totally out of having any
say in this, Members need to support
this amendment.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN), who is a colonel in
the Army, was a colonel in the Army,
and was helpful from day one in
crafting this.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Chair, I rise in support of the amend-
ment, which is the product of hard
work from my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle.
The administration does not have au-
thorization to take military action in
or against Iran and must come to Con-
gress for that authority, and this
amendment makes that crystal clear.
Many members of the administration
have been trying to make a case for a
war with Iran for months, if not years,
going so far as to try to speciously tie
Iran to al-Qaida and claim the 2001
AUMF passed in the aftermath of the
attack on 9/11 might authorize war
against Iran.
Congress must reassert our constitu-
tional authority.
There is no question that Iran is a
bad actor and they have been for a long
time, but if the administration believes
that armed conflict is the way to keep
us safe, then the administration must
make the case to Congress and the
American people, because it will be
their sons and daughters who will be on
the front lines of that brutal war.
We cannot be a Congress or a nation
that accepts going to war on a whim as
the status quo. I firmly believe it is
time for Congress to repeal and replace
the 2001 AUMF, but until we can do
that, we must pass this amendment
now.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
have only myself to close, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. HIMES), who led 100-plus
Members in a letter opposing the war
with Iran.
Mr. HIMES. Madam Chair, I would
like to thank Mr. SMITH and Mr.
KHANNA for their leadership on this
amendment and just express my dis-
appointment at the statements made
by my friend, Mr. MCCAUL.
I never imagined that an amendment
that essentially restated congressional
authority as detailed in the Constitu-
tion would ever get characterized as a
propaganda win for Iran, as a pro-Iran
thing; and I would remind my friend,
Mr. MCCAUL, that, yes, the President
stepped away from a military conflict
that might have been justified as an
act of self-defense.
I am not in the practice of praising
the President on this floor, but he took
a prudent course a few weeks ago.
There is absolutely no guarantee he
will do so again.
This amendment does one simple
thing. It is not unprecedented. Its
precedent is the United States Con-
stitution, which vests war-making au-
thority when it is not in self-defense,
as Mr. SMITH points out, exclusively in
the Congress. Now, we may or may not
like that idea, but it is the principle
that we swore to uphold.
And I would just remind the Chamber
that, every time we allow a Democratic
or a Republican President to go to war
without an authorization in this Cham-
ber, we shirk our constitutional duty.
We fail to back our warfighters with
the full and robust voice of the United
States Government.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. ESHOO), my good friend who
has led this bill in the House that pre-
vents funding for a war with Iran.
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Chair, I thank
my colleague, Mr. KHANNA, for yield-
ing.
I rise in strong support of amend-
ment 423, and I want to thank all of the
Members who have worked so hard on
this.
I am proud to have written legisla-
tion in early April of this year, the
Prevention of Unconstitutional War
with Iran Act, which enjoys 79 cospon-
sors and prohibits the President from
using any funding appropriated by Con-
gress to take military action in or
against Iran without authorization
from Congress. This amendment mir-
rors and complements that legislation
by prohibiting the use of any funding
in this year’s NDAA to carry out unau-
thorized military attacks against Iran.
It is very important to have this
amendment on the floor because the
Trump administration seems deter-
mined to provoke military confronta-
tion with Iran, and the President and
his hawkish advisers have publicly
stated that they don’t need authoriza-
tion from Congress to carry out pre-
emptive attacks.
They are wrong. The U.S. Constitu-
tion is clear. Article I, Section 8 gives
Congress the sole authority to declare
war, allowing the American people to
decide, through their Representatives
in Congress, whether military action is
in the best interest of the country.
We carry no grief for Iran, not one of
us, but this amendment should pass.
The Acting CHAIR. Members are re-
minded to heed the gavel.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I yield
to the gentleman from Massachusetts
(Mr. MOULTON), a veteran who was in
four tours of duty and fought against
the Iranians in his second tour in Iraq.
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Chair, col-
leagues, this vote is about several
things.
It is about war with Iran. The Presi-
dent and John Bolton have manufac-
tured a crisis by withdrawing America
from the Iran nuclear deal with no al-
ternative, and Iran has a strategic ad-
vantage over us now that they did not
have before under the deal.
This vote is about the Authorization
for Use of Military Force passed almost
20 years ago that does not authorize
war with Iran. We do not underesti-
mate the Iranian threat. It is real, it is
significant, but that does not make
going to war now legal or necessary.
But most of all, this vote is about the
Constitution and our duty to uphold it.
It is the Commander in Chief’s job to
strengthen our national security, not
weaken it, as he has done, and it is
Congress’ job to decide when we send
young Americans to war.
The oath that we all took to protect
and defend the Constitution of the
United States is the same oath, word-
for-word, that I took as a Marine offi-
cer.
Our troops are upholding that oath.
They are doing their jobs. It is time for
us in Congress to do ours.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, how
much time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from California has 21⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I yield
45 seconds to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. CROW), a leading veteran
voice, who has been helpful in getting
many veterans groups on board with
this.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I rise
today to support this amendment to re-
assert Congress’ constitutional role in
authorizing the use of military force.
As a former Army Ranger, I learned
firsthand that when politicians talk
tough in this town, real people get
hurt.
It was an honor to serve our country
in Iraq and Afghanistan, but I also wit-
nessed the consequences of sending
Americans into harm’s way without de-
fined goals and a clear exit strategy.
The most solemn responsibility of
Congress is the decision to authorize
the use of military force. It is a respon-
sibility that our Founders reserved for
Congress because we are directly and
daily accountable to those who have to
fight our wars: our sons, daughters,
mothers, and fathers.

I urge my colleagues to join me in re-
asserting Congress’ role in deciding
when to use military force by voting
‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. It is time to
fulfill our constitutional duty.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
yield an additional 1 minute to the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL).
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, no one
respects the Constitution more than I
do. We have Article I authorities.
There is a reason why the Founding
Fathers put Article I first, because
that is the American people over the
imperial presidency.
Why are we debating such an impor-
tant issue, matters of war and peace,
which is what my committee argues
day in and day out on the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee—well, first of all, it is
part of the NDAA. But why are we ar-
guing this at 9:15 at night, in the dark-
ness of night and not the sunlight of
day?
This is a dangerous amendment. It is
a preemptive use of the AUMF.
We have not engaged in hostile
forces, combat forces in Iran. We have
not engaged in hostilities. That is
when the War Powers Resolution kicks
in, notification to the Congress, and
then Congress debates the Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force.
I have been in this body for eight
terms. That is how the process works.
You don’t handcuff the President, the
Commander in Chief. You don’t hand-
cuff him in advance of any preparation
for dealing with state-sponsored terror.
This is just wrong.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I yield
30 seconds to the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), who has an im-
portant bill clarifying the 2001–2002
AUMF.
b 2115
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chair, the amendment before us is
about our responsibility to protect the
American people. It is about our val-
ues.
Do we believe the President acting on
his own should be able to put our
troops in harm’s way and put us at risk
of another horrific war with zero input
from the American people’s elected
representatives in Congress? Or do we
want to make clear that we are going
to do our job, the job our constituents
elected us to do, follow the Constitu-
tion, and prevent a reckless attack on
Iran?
This isn’t about being a Democrat or
a Republican. As a Member of the peo-
ple’s House, colleagues should support
this amendment to prevent an unau-
thorized attack on Iran and make it
clear that this Congress has not au-
thorized the use of military force, in
line with my bipartisan AUMF Clari-
fication Act.
Madam Chair, I thank Representa-
tive KHANNA for yielding.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I yield
30 seconds to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LEE), for her work on
asserting Congress’ authority over war
and peace.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
it is up to Congress to prevent another
costly war in the Middle East. For too
long, Congress has ceded its respon-
sibilities as a coequal branch of gov-
ernment when it comes to matters of
war and peace.
As The New York Times recently put
it: ‘‘It is long past time that the legis-
lative branch reclaimed its central role
in overseeing war waged in the name of
the American people.’’
Madam Chair, I thank Congressman
KHANNA for this amendment. He has
been persistent and very clear about
our role in the areas of war and peace,
and it builds upon the amendment I got
into the Defense appropriations bill
that indicated and said that nothing in
the Defense appropriations bill could
be construed as authorization for the
use of force in Iran.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, how
much time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from California has 45 seconds remain-
ing.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I yield
30 seconds to the gentlewoman from
New Mexico (Ms. HAALAND), one of the
new leaders on HASC who has been
very, very helpful on this amendment.
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Chair, this
administration’s reckless behavior
threatens to plunge the region into
chaos and our own country into an-
other endless and costly war.
We have powerful, peaceful tools to
bring other countries to the negoti-
ating table. Under the leadership of
President Obama, we used these tools
successfully to neutralize Iran’s nu-
clear program.
The President’s irresponsible policies
have squandered that progress and, in-
stead, set into motion tensions that
are spiraling out of control.
We have alienated our closest allies,
and Iran is taking steps toward devel-
oping a nuclear weapon. This senseless-
ness demonstrates that this adminis-
tration cannot be trusted with the au-
thority to use military force in Iran.
Madam Chair, I support this amend-
ment.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I yield
the balance of my time to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE)
for a closing argument.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair,
the people of Iran do not want war.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman
from California for allowing us, no
matter what time of night it is, to
stand on the floor and declare that the
people of Iran do not want war.
The people of the United States know
that the Constitution says that Con-
gress has the right to declare war.
Madam Chair, I support this amend-
ment, because it speaks to the Con-
stitution and our right to declare war
and to stand against war and sending
our young men and women without the
authority of the United States Con-
gress.
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Chair, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Chair, I am very sympathetic
to the idea that Congress has neglected
to fulfill its responsibilities under the
Constitution in this area for many
years, with Presidents of both parties
and with congressional majorities of
both parties.
Unfortunately, I believe that this
amendment goes way too far in re-
stricting the ability of the President to
exercise his responsibilities under Arti-
cle II.
I note that one of the most recent
speakers referenced President Obama.
It was President Obama who used force
in Libya with no authorization from
this Congress. As a matter of fact,
every President since Truman has done
so. The notion that it is either all-out
war or nothing does not reflect the way
the world is or has been for the last 70
years.
I also have to note that it is some-
what concerning to me that much of
this amendment seems focused person-
ally at President Trump, who is bend-
ing over backward not to use military
force and has campaigned against some
of the uses in the past. It does not seem
to me to be appropriate.
On the substance of the amendment,
we have asked senior general officers
with responsibility for operations on
the Joint Staff and CENTCOM to look
at this language. What they tell us is
that they are concerned with this lan-
guage. I understand the representa-
tions that have been made, but the peo-
ple who have to live under it believe it
would foreclose the inherent right of
self-defense at a time when we have
specific, detailed, and credible threats
against 65,000 military personnel in the
CENTCOM region. They believe it
would immediately stop purely defen-
sive intelligence-sharing and defensive
border security we are doing with part-
ners in the region. They believe it
would halt orders with options to
strike back proportionally against Iran
in order to limit escalation and would
stop active information-related capa-
bilities directly countering Iranian
threat networks.
Furthermore, they believe that there
is enough concern about this language
that it would at least throw doubt on
our ability to come to the defense of
Israel if it were under attack from
Iran, Iranian proxies, or the Iranian
threat network. They believe it would
cast doubt on our ability to come to
the defense of a ship or vessel in the
Strait of Hormuz if an ally comes
under attack.
I would point out that just within the
last 2 days, an allied tanker was at
least threatened by Iranian boats com-
ing through the strait.
Senior general officers at the Joint
Staff and CENTCOM believe it would
threaten continued Seventh Fleet
interdiction efforts in the Indo-Pacific
to thwart Iranian sanctions evasion.
We have a number of ways that are
not war but legitimate use of force.

People who have to live under it be-
lieve this goes too far and prevents
them from doing what they are doing,
which gets back to what Mr. MCCAUL
was talking about. That is, this is only
good news for Iran and the threat that
they pose.
It uses a powerful funding mecha-
nism to tie the President’s hands, and
they can only be untied after the House
and Senate take action. We know that
we often don’t move too quickly in
these areas.
Again, I am sympathetic with the
idea that Congress needs to stand up
and do our job. We need to do it respon-
sibly, not the kind of overreach that
gives assistance to adversaries and
makes our allies much more concerned
about whether we will stand with them
or not.
Madam Chair, I believe this amend-
ment should be rejected, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Chair, I rise in sup-
port of the bipartisan amendment offered by
Representatives KHANNA, GAETZ, ENGEL,
SMITH (WA), BROWN, LEVIN (MI) and me, along
with 80 other cosponsors, to prohibit funding
for any engagement in military hostilities in or
against Iran without explicit authorization by
Congress.
I want to thank my good friend, Congress-
man KHANNA, for his leadership on this issue.
I especially want to thank Armed Services
Committee Chairman SMITH, Foreign Affairs
Chairman ENGEL and their excellent staff, who
worked tirelessly to ensure that this amend-
ment reflected a broad, bipartisan range of
concerns on how best to respond to the re-
lentless march to war with Iran that is hap-
pening under President Trump and his belli-
cose advisors.
Madam Chair, our nation almost went to war
with Iran just a couple of weeks ago.
Think about this. We were apparently only
moments away from the president launching
an attack against Iran that could have quickly
snowballed out of control into a major conflict.
There was no consultation with Congress. No
debate on this floor. No input at all from this
House whose Members represent the service-
men and women who would be put in harm’s
way. Let alone a vote.
Democrats don’t want war with Iran. Most
Republicans don’t want war with Iran. The
American people certainly don’t want a war in
Iran.
But this president was apparently about to
use an AUMF passed nearly two decades ago
to fumble us into another conflict in the Middle
East.
I’m glad the president backed off bombing
Iran. But I’m terrified about the lack of thought-
ful leadership coming from the Oval Office.
We need to make clear to this administra-
tion that the president cannot use an old
AUMF to initiate hostilities against Iran.
Nor can he engage in military hostilities in
or against Iran without first coming to Con-
gress and getting a specific authorization for
the use of such force. Period.
It’s long past time for Congress to step up
to the plate and carry out its constitutional re-
sponsibilities on matters of war and peace.
I urge all my colleagues, on both sides of
the aisle, to support this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from California (Mr. KHANNA).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.

ceedings on the amendment offered by

AMENDMENT NO. 424 OFFERED BY MS. LEE OF
CALIFORNIA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 424 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle G of title XII, on
page 842, after line 14, insert the following
section:
SEC. 1268. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR THE
USE OF MILITARY FORCE.
The Authorization for Use of Military
Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public
Law 107–243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is repealed.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LEE) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
I thank our chairman of the Rules
Committee, Mr. MCGOVERN, and I
thank the chair of the Armed Services
Committee, Chairman SMITH, for work-
ing with me and all of our members on
this amendment and for making this
amendment in order.
Madam Chair, I am pleased to offer
this amendment along with Represent-
atives ADAM SCHIFF, ELIOT ENGEL,
JASON CROW, JOHN LEWIS, SETH
MOULTON, MAX ROSE, and many, many
others.
Madam Chair, this amendment is
straightforward; it is timely; and it
should be noncontroversial. It would
immediately repeal the 2002 Authoriza-
tion for the Use of Military Force
against Iraq. Repeal of the 2002 AUMF
would not impact any existing military
operations because it no longer serves
an operational purpose.
Leaving the 2002 AUMF on the books
runs the risk that it could be utilized
by the executive branch for military
operations that Congress never in-
tended to authorize.
When Congress passed the 2002 AUMF
prior to the invasion of Iraq, it was in-
tended to address the perceived threat
posed by the regime of Saddam Hussein
as it related to the presence of weapons
of mass destruction. United States
military deployments and operations
carried out pursuant to the 2002 AUMF,
Operation Iraqi Freedom, officially
concluded in 2011.
Seventeen years after the resolu-
tion’s passage, the United States recog-
nizes the sovereignty of Iraq and con-
siders the Iraqi Government a key ally.
Both the Obama and Trump adminis-
trations have maintained that the 2002
AUMF only serves to reinforce cur-
rently existing legal authority. None of
the counterterrorism operations being
carried out in Iraq independently de-
pend on the 2002 AUMF for authoriza-
tion.
For these reasons, the 2002 AUMF is
outdated and should no longer be on
the books. Leaving it in effect risks
abuse by this and any future adminis-
tration.
For example, the Trump administra-
tion has claimed that the 2002 AUMF
authorizes the use of force to address
both ‘‘threats to’’ and ‘‘stemming from
Iraq,’’ and it authorizes force in ‘‘Syria
or elsewhere.’’
Expansive interpretations such as
this demonstrate why we strongly be-
lieve that the 2002 AUMF should be im-
mediately repealed.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I oppose
this amendment to repeal the 2002 law
that authorizes the use of military
force ‘‘to defend the national security
of the United States against the con-
tinued threat posed by Iraq.’’
First of all, the repeal of any AUMF
does not belong in this NDAA bill. The
Committee on Foreign Affairs has
longstanding sole jurisdiction over dec-
larations of war and intervention
abroad. Any significant change to war-
making authorities needs to be the re-
sult of deliberations and votes by the
committee of jurisdiction.
There is no issue more deserving of
regular order than issues related to
war and peace.
Although none of us want to see the
extension of any conflict beyond what
is necessary, we have also learned that
premature disengagement can have
huge costs, such as when the prior ad-
ministration’s rush to withdraw U.S.
troops contributed to the deadly rise of
ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
While the Saddam Hussein regime
was a key focus, it was not the sole
focus of the 2002 AUMF. It expressly
identified al-Qaida and ‘‘other inter-
national terrorist organizations, in-
cluding organizations that threaten
the lives and safety of the United
States citizens.’’
Members will recall that al-Qaida in
Iraq later became ISIS, a brutal
transnational terrorist organization
that continues to threaten American
lives and interests. President Obama
cited the 2002 AUMF as legal authority
for his military operations against
ISIS.
The current administration has stat-
ed its opposition to the repeal of the
2002 AUMF because:
It remains an important source of addi-
tional authority for military operations
against ISIS in Iraq and to defend the na-
tional security interests of the United States
against threats emanating from Iraq.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5719
July 11, 2019
For those reasons, we shouldn’t be
repealing key counterterrorism AUMFs
unless and until we have replaced them
with updated authorities that clearly
confront the enemies that continue to
threaten our Nation, our people, and
our allies. To date, we have seen no
such proposal from the majority.
So for those reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in prioritizing
American security by opposing this
amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
b 2130
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. SMITH), the
chairman of the Armed Services Com-
mittee.
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam
Chair, the purpose of the 2002 AUMF
could not have been more clear. I was
here at the time. It was one of the
more consequential debates we have
ever had. And the purpose was clearly
stated to go after Saddam Hussein be-
cause he had weapons of mass destruc-
tion and to wage war against the na-
tion of Iraq.
If we cannot repeal that 17 years
later, then Congress has truly and to-
tally abrogated its constitutional re-
sponsibility to regulate any use of
military force. There is no justification
17 years later to keep this on the books
so that Presidents can use the author-
ity as a blank check. Congress should
stand up.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Colorado (Mr. CROW), a veteran who
served his country well and now is
serving this body well.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I rise
today to support Representative LEE’s
important amendment to repeal the
2002 Authorization for Use of Military
Force, an authorization that has long
outlived its intended purpose: the 2002
AUMF authorized U.S. force to over-
throw Saddam Hussein’s regime and
enforce U.N. resolutions in Iraq. Much
has changed since those days and,
today, Iraq is an important partner in
the fight against terrorism.
As the justification for the 2002
AUMF has ended, so, too, should this
authorization. This is not an opinion I
alone hold. Just today, Army Chief of
Staff, a nominee for the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, stated
that the 2001 AUMF provides all of the
authorities necessary for ongoing coun-
terterrorism operations in the region. I
agree with General Milley and believe
it is time to repeal this outdated au-
thorization that no longer serves an
operational purpose.
A common theme in the NDAA this
year is the emphasis on increasing
transparency and reasserting congres-
sional oversight on matters of war and
diplomacy.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to vote yes on this amendment and
demonstrate that Congress is re-
asserting its Article I authorities and
responsibilities.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
how much time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. FLETCHER).
The gentlewoman from California has 1
minute remaining.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON), an ex-
pert on national security.
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Chair, when
is enough enough? The vote to go to
war against Iraq in 2002 was a mistake.
Congress should have been more care-
ful, questioned the intelligence, and
made sure that we exhausted every
other option before we put young
American lives in danger.
It is time that we stopped living off
those past mistakes. Both the Obama
administration and the Trump admin-
istration have maintained that the 2002
AUMF only serves to reinforce cur-
rently existing legal authority.
So it needs to end. We need to repeal
it. Because keeping it in place does not
support current operations, and it
could be used as a legal pretext for fu-
ture escalation in the Middle East that
has not been authorized by Congress.
If we ever need to go to war against
Iraq again, Congress has the constitu-
tional obligation to make that deci-
sion. And we are fortunate that now
that decision will be made, in part, by
the generation that fought in Iraq and
Afghanistan, which is coming to Con-
gress to step in for the generation that
sent us there.
So let’s get rid of this mistake, clear
the decks for a new generation of bet-
ter, more accountable leadership, and
ensure that Congress takes more care-
ful responsibility for these decisions
moving forward.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
I yield back the balance of my time.

Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,

The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle H of title X, insert
the following:
SEC. 10ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING
THE 2001 AUTHORIZATION FOR USE
OF MILITARY FORCE.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The Authorization for Use of Military
Force (referred to in this section as the ‘‘2001
AUMF’’) (Public Law 107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541
note) was passed by Congress in 2001 after
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
to authorize the use of force against those
responsible for the attacks of September 11,
2001.
(2) The 2001 AUMF is one of the only mod-
ern authorizations for the use of force in the
history of the United States that included no
limitation in time, geography, operations, or
a named enemy.
(3) The 2001 AUMF has been cited 41 times
as the legal basis for the use of force in 19
countries.
(4) Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution
provides Congress with the sole authority to
‘‘declare war’’.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the use of the 2001 AUMF has been well
beyond the scope that Congress initially in-
tended when it was passed on September 14,
2001;
(2) nearly 18 years after the passage of the
2001 AUMF, it has served as a blank check
for any President to wage war at any time
and at any place; and
(3) any new authorization for the use of
military force that replaces the 2001 AUMF
should include—
(A) a sunset clause and timeframe within
which Congress should revisit the authority
provided in the new authorization for use of
military force;
(B) a clear and specific expression of mis-
sion objectives, targets, and geographic
scope; and
(C) reporting requirements to increase
transparency and ensure proper Congres-
sional oversight.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LEE) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
first, I thank our Rules Committee
chair, Mr. MCGOVERN, as well as all the
members of the committee for making
this amendment in order. And I also
thank our chairman, Mr. SMITH, for
working with us to bring this amend-
ment forward.
I am proud to offer this amendment
with Representative MAX ROSE. It is a
very straightforward amendment. It
simply expresses the sense of Congress
that the 2001 AUMF has been utilized
well beyond the scope than Congress
intended, and that it is far past time
for Congress to reassert our constitu-
tional mandated role in war making.
Our amendment also states that any
new authorization should include more
specific provisions, including a sunset
clause, clear and specific expression of
objectives, targets, and geographic
scope.
Madam Chair, my amendment is not
only necessary, but it is timely. Right
now, the Trump administration is
threatening to use the 2001 AUMF as a
legal basis to go to war with Iran. This
demonstrates the dangers of leaving
this authorization for the use of mili-
tary force on the books indefinitely.
The 2001 AUMF is only 60 words, and
one of the only modern authorizations

for the use of force that includes no
limitations in time, geography, oper-
ations, or a named enemy.
On September 14, 2001, 3 days after
the horrific attacks, I was the only
‘‘no’’ vote in Congress for the 2001
AUMF. It was an authorization that I
knew would provide a blank check for
the President, any President, to wage a
war anywhere, any time, and for any
length. In the last 18 years, it has been
used by three consecutive administra-
tions to wage war at any time, at any
place, without congressional oversight
or authorization.
According to a 2018 Congressional Re-
search Service report, which I encour-
age all of my colleagues to read, the
2001 AUMF has, in fact, become that
blank check for war. In the almost 18
years since its passage, it has been
cited 41 times in 19 countries to wage
war with little or no congressional
oversight. And this report only looks
at unclassified incidents. How many
other times has it been used without
the knowledge of Congress or the
American people?
The AUMF has reportedly been in-
voked to deploy troops in Syria,
Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and Niger. We
know that this is far beyond what Con-
gress intended when it was passed in
2001 in the days after the terrible at-
tacks of 9/11.
That is why our amendment is so im-
portant. It is a sense of Congress sim-
ply recognizing that this has been used
well beyond what Congress originally
intended when it first passed in 2001;
that Article I, Section 8 of the Con-
stitution provides Congress with the
sole authority to declare war; and that
any new AUMF to replace the 2001
should include a timeframe within
which Congress should revisit the au-
thority provided in any AUMF, which
many experts agree needs to be in-
cluded in any replacement AUMF.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Chair, I rise in
strong opposition to this amendment.
It simply lists complaints about the
2001 authorization for the use of mili-
tary force while avoiding the serious
work of proposing an improved replace-
ment.
Most Members, including me, would
say they would be fine with an updated
AUMF that better describes current
threats. Unfortunately, there is no con-
sensus at all about what that should
look like. The fact that the majority
has not put forward a single proposal
in the 6 months they have been in
charge indicates to me that they have
deep disagreements.
The author of this amendment has
also inserted an outright repeal of the
2001 AUMF into this year’s Defense ap-
propriations bill, which would make all
counterterrorism operations globally
illegal. That is reckless because AUMF
provides the necessary legal authority
to confront ongoing deadly threats
against our homeland. It would also be
simply irresponsible and dangerous to
repeal it until an adequate replace-
ment has passed both Chambers and
been sent to the President’s desk.
The gentlewoman from California,
with all respect, has held a principled,
consistent position on this issue, and I
do respect that. I just disagree with it.
But it is incorrect to assert, as this
amendment does, that the 2001 AUMF
is a blank check for any President to
wage war at any time and at any place.
The AUMF has been interpreted as cov-
ering al-Qaida, the Taliban, and ‘‘asso-
ciated forces.’’ And while that interpre-
tation is sometimes broad, it can’t be
stretched to cover just anything. For
example, it does not capture North
Korea or countless other potential ad-
versaries and, arguably, Iran, as well.
The amendment also complains that
the 2001 AUMF did not include things
like geographic limitations or a named
enemy. But it is hard to see how it
could have done so while also meeting
the grave transnational terrorist
threats it was intended to defeat. Be-
cause these enemies aren’t nation-
states marching uniformed troops to
face us on the fields of battle, author-
izing force to fight them is much more
complicated.
The amendment also wrongly implies
that the will of Congress has been
thwarted by how long and how broadly
the AUMF has been used. But Congress
has been kept aware of how it is being
used, and has always had the same
power to legislate, amend, or repeal, as
it had back in 2001. The fact is—and
this goes on both sides of the aisle—it
has not done so. That indicates a deci-
sion that, under both Democrat and
Republican majorities and administra-
tions, the 2001 AUMF is working.
For my years as Homeland Security
chairman, I know that our operations
overseas, and the sacrifices of our serv-
ice men and women, have saved Amer-
ican lives and helped to protect the
homeland from countless thwarted at-
tacks.
Unfortunately, the threat does con-
tinue. As the Director of National In-
telligence has testified, al-Qaida and
ISIS maintain transnational networks
actively committed to our destruction.
Don’t get me wrong: I would like to see
an updated AUMF as well. That comes
out of the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs. We should deliberate an updated
AUMF on our committee. But this
amendment contributes nothing to-
wards that outcome.
Until we have new authorities in
place to combat the real and dynamic
threats to American lives and safety,
we need to focus on responsibly using
the authorities we have, not just com-
plaining about their imperfections.
If the other side is serious about a
fix, then let’s work together on a fix
and provide a serious replacement to
begin this process on a very serious
issue of counterterrorism and war and
peace.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair,
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from New York (Mr. ROSE), my col-
league, who serves on the Homeland
Security Committee and Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee.
b 2145
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam
Chair, I want to thank my good friend,
Congresswoman LEE, for introducing
this amendment and, just as impor-
tantly, for her, as our colleagues on the
other side of the aisle noted, consist-
ency and leadership on this issue for
the last 18 years.
Madam Chair, it will be 18 years this
coming September. Men and women
will enlist in the United States mili-
tary who were not born on 9/11. They
are enlisting in the United States mili-
tary, and they will likely go to fight in
a war in Afghanistan that is currently
being fought based off an authorization
that was signed before they were born.
In the last 18 years, three different
Presidents from both parties—yes, this
is a Democratic and a Republican prob-
lem—have conducted countless mili-
tary operations in 19 different coun-
tries against groups entirely unrelated
to those who attacked our country.
I don’t want to hear that we don’t
understand. I fought in Afghanistan. I
am a New Yorker. I was in New York
City on 9/11. We understand the sever-
ity of this problem. We understand
that, in the immediate aftermath of 9/
11, we had to kill those people who had
killed innocent people in this country.
But that is not what this is about
today, and we refuse to make that the
focus of this discussion.
This is about Congress doing its job.
This is about the fact that we are still
waging war, and 80 percent of this in-
stitution has never voted to declare
war.
This is about the fact that, right
now, we are unwilling to enact a piece
of legislation that requires Congress to
do its job in 8 months.
So I say to my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle, we accept your
invitation.

AMENDMENT NO. 428 OFFERED BY MS. GARCIA OF

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order

in part B of House Report 116–143.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Chair-
woman, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle E of title X, insert
the following:
SEC. 10ll. PROHIBITION ON USE OF DEPART-
MENT OF DEFENSE FACILITIES TO
HOUSE OR DETAIN UNACCOM-
PANIED ALIEN CHILDREN.
(a) PROHIBITION.—No Department of De-
fense facility may be used to house or detain
unaccompanied alien children.
(b) UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILDREN DE-
FINED.—The term ‘‘unaccompanied alien
children’’ has the meaning given such term
in section 462 of the Homeland Security Act
of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279)).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Chair,
this amendment is simple and straight-
forward. It is 15 words. It prohibits de-
fense facilities from being used to
house or detain unaccompanied mi-
grant children.
I understand the bill already provides
some safeguards, so detention at DOD
facilities would follow certain guide-
lines, but this amendment makes clear
that the policy to detain children is
out of line with American principles.
Detention is not the answer to an in-
flux of migrants.
There are communities across the
country, including in my own district,
ready to welcome the children seeking
refuge. Asylum seekers are not crimi-
nals; they are human beings fleeing vi-
olence in search of a dignified life.
Children fleeing violence should not be
met with cruelty.
Preventing migrants from joining so-
ciety is not only preventing the Amer-
ican economy from growing, but it also
is costing taxpayers much more than it
should.
Instead of encouraging placement of
children with capable sponsors, the en-
tire system appears to be weighted
against moving children out of deten-
tion, all for the so-called deterrent ef-
fect.
There is no national security reason
to detain children. Kids are not pris-
oners of war. They do not belong at
military bases. They do not belong in
tents. They do not belong in cages.
They belong in the arms of their moth-
ers and with their families.
It is our broken immigration system
that keeps children locked up. It is in-
humane; it is cruel; and it is uncon-
scionable.
The administration’s policies resem-
ble those of a military style, and the
distress it creates in the system is gen-
erating a costly humanitarian crisis.
We should move away from this injus-
tice and support my amendment.
We must close all baby jails, and
Congress must stop perpetuating the
expensive and cruel patchwork the im-
migration system has become. We must
learn from the lessons that history
teaches us and not turn military bases
into internment camps.
This amendment would ensure that
we don’t repeat past mistakes. This
amendment would also prohibit the ad-
ministration from detaining immi-
grant children at Fort Sill, a military
base once used as an internment camp
for Japanese Americans.
Moreover, this administration is con-
sidering detaining migrants in Guanta-
namo Bay. This amendment would pre-
vent children from being shipped and
detained there.
The military should not be dragged
into this detention crisis that this ad-
ministration has created. Mission read-
iness should always be the top priority
for our armed services.
Madam Chairwoman, I thank Rep-
resentative CHUY GARCÍA from Illinois,
JUAN VARGAS from California, ALEXAN-
DRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ from New York,
RASHIDA TLAIB from Michigan, and
AYANNA PRESSLEY from Massachusetts
for their cosponsorship of this amend-
ment.
I urge all of my colleagues to support
this simple amendment, 15 words that
protect our children and helps put
them in the arms of their families.
Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chair, I rise in opposition to this
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Chairwoman, liberals and
progressives have launched a concerted
attack on our defense authorization.
They have attached a string of par-
tisan, progressive policy riders de-
signed to gut DOD’s assistance along
the southern border.
Every day, about half of all Customs
and Border Protection officers are
pulled off the line for administrative
duty, transportation, and other work,
taking them away from the border—
mostly taking care of children. The im-
portant job of caring for families and
unaccompanied children has been a tre-
mendous challenge for these Border Pa-
trol agents.
Border Patrol stations and many
HHS shelters have been at or above ca-
pacity for months. In fact, the last 4
months, we have had over 100,000 appre-
hensions each of those months.
DHS has found 63,000 unaccompanied
alien children along the southern bor-
der so far this year. That is 13,000 more
than all of last year. In the past, DOD
has been a trusted partner in housing
thousands of migrant children. This
amendment bans all DOD assistance to
housing unaccompanied children.
Since 2012, DOD has provided DOD fa-
cilities and land for the Department of
Health and Human Services to shelter
nearly 16,000 unaccompanied alien chil-
dren who receive care, security, trans-
portation, and medical services. It
would be irresponsible to cut off DOD’s
ability to provide safe, secure, and ac-
countable shelter for these unaccom-
panied children in the middle of a bor-
der crisis.
I strongly oppose this amendment
and urge my colleagues to do the same,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Chair-
woman, how much time do I have re-
maining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Texas has 11⁄2 minutes remaining.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Chair,
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), my col-
league from Houston.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair-
woman, let me thank the gentlewoman
from Texas, Congresswoman GARCIA,
for her leadership. It can be seen that
we are intertwining on this issue, and I
thank her for acknowledging the fact
that these children are unaccompanied.
We are not saying adults. We are not
saying criminals. What we are saying
is they are children who are unaccom-
panied migrant children. Many of them
are unaccompanied because of the zero-
tolerance policy of this administration,
the continued policy of separating chil-
dren from their guardian, from their
grandmother, from their aunt.
How do I know this? Because I saw
this firsthand this past Monday, just 3
days ago, where unaccompanied chil-
dren were held in a facility.
I asked the question: How are they
unaccompanied? They are unaccom-
panied because we took the adults
away from them.
This is simple to say that these chil-
dren not be held in Department of De-
fense facilities. This does not under-
mine this bill. It simply says that chil-
dren are precious and should be han-
dled in a manner that provides them
with the care, courtesy, and love of the
right kind of facilities.
But, most importantly, I support this
amendment because I join my col-
league in saying that we do not accept
zero tolerance in separating children.
I support the amendment. I thank
the gentlewoman for her leadership in
taking these children out of the De-
partment of Defense facilities.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chairwoman, I have no further speak-
ers, so I reserve the balance of my time
to close.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Chair-
woman, I will just close. I think I prob-
ably have about 30 to 45 seconds.
I just want to repeat something I
have said. I think it is important that
we emphasize that we are talking
about children, young children.
And, again, there is no national secu-
rity reason to detain children. Kids
aren’t prisoners of war. They do not be-
long in military bases. They do not be-
long in tents. They do not belong in

a capable sponsor.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chairwoman, I just want to remind
people that we don’t want to have
these unaccompanied children not have
appropriate places to stay and to get
medical care, transportation, and su-
pervision that they need. That is all
that we are providing for them, be-
cause we don’t have them in the CBP.
So I would urge people to reject this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 429 OFFERED BY MS. OCASIO-
CORTEZ
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 429 printed
in part B of House Report 116–143.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of subtitle E of title X, insert
the following:
SEC. 10ll. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR
ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION
AND NATIONALITY ACT.
None of the funds authorized to be appro-
priated or otherwise made available for the
Department of Defense for fiscal year 2020
may be obligated or expended for any activ-
ity authorized pursuant to chapter 15 of title
10, United States Code, or section 1059 of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 15 2016 (Public Law 114–92; 129 Stat.
986; 10 U.S.C. 271 note prec.), if a significant
purpose of the activity is to assist with the
enforcement of any part of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
this amendment prohibits the execu-
tive branch from deploying troops on
the southern border if the purpose of
this deployment is to enforce immigra-
tion law.
According to the Congressional Re-
search Service, the armed services do
not have a clear legislative mandate to
protect or patrol the border. That is
under the guidance of other aspects of
our legislative and executive branch.
The militarization of our immigra-
tion system, particularly under this
administration, must be stopped. This
amendment ensures that our troops are
to be deployed only in the most exigent
circumstances to address actual na-
tional security threats.
This amendment would rescind the
authority granted in the 2016 NDAA,
which empowers the President to need-
lessly deploy troops to the border to
enforce immigration law.
The amendment would not interfere
with any mission that is truly humani-
tarian or a true national security con-
cern.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
First, I want to point out, when DOD
assets are sent to the border, it is in a
support capacity. They don’t serve in a
law enforcement capacity. They don’t
patrol the border.
Right now, we have half of our Bor-
der Patrol agents, on a daily basis,
being taken off the border and put into
administrative functions, not doing
law enforcement.
b 2200
When we send DOD assets down
there, it is typically National Guard
personnel. They fill those back-end ad-
ministrative functions so the CBP-
trained agents can go in and enforce
the law.
Madam Chair, you never have seen
and you are not going to see the DOD
assets being used to enforce the law.
The military has played an impor-
tant role in securing our southern bor-
der since the 1980s. Presidents Reagan,
H.W. Bush, Clinton, W. Bush, and
Obama have authorized DOD assistance
on the border in the form of equipment
or manpower on multiple occasions.
Every day, about half of all Customs
and Border Protection officers are
pulled off the line for administrative
duty, transportation, and other work
away from the border.
There were over 104,000 illegal aliens
in June. That is a 380 percent increase
over June 2017. CBP is on track for over
1 million apprehensions in this fiscal
year.
DOD has been on site for months pro-
viding support. DOD medium-lift air
mobility support moves CBP agents to
remote areas. Administrative and
transportation support puts CBP
agents back in the field and off bus
duty. They provide camera and areal
sensor operations to help identify large
groups of migrants and smuggler activ-
ity and to cut down on response times.
This support is directly improving
border apprehensions and response
times.
Again, DOD support on the border
has been a bipartisan policy to address
migration surges for decades. Cutting
off DOD assistance will immediately
and substantially worsen the crisis on
our border.
Madam Chair, I strongly oppose this
amendment. I urge my colleagues to do
the same, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
the deployment of troops on our border
is a relatively new phenomenon. It is
one that is unprecedented, and it rep-
resents an unnecessary militarization
toward what should be seen as a hu-
manitarian crisis.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO).
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Chair,
the President should be sending the
Red Cross to the border, not the United
States military.
I stand today with many of my col-
leagues to ensure that our government
is not misusing funds, resources, and
personnel that Congress has provided.
We have seen again and again how this
administration manipulates the law,
congressional intent, and allocated
funding in order to impede the immi-
gration process and play with people’s
lives.
There is no reason for the adminis-
tration to force the Department of De-
fense to advance his anti-immigrant
agenda and use our valuable troops to
conduct immigration enforcement du-
ties. These are young children and
women who are fleeing desperate situa-
tions, and they should be treated for
what they are, folks seeking asylum at
the U.S.-Mexico border who are law-
fully petitioning for asylum in the
United States.
We don’t need the military there. We
need the Red Cross.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE),
who is my friend and colleague.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing and further thank him for his lead-
ership on border security matters and
for opposing this harmful and extrem-
ist amendment.
Madam Chair, I rise in the strongest
possible opposition to the amendment
offered by the gentlewoman from New
York. This amendment is dangerous,
and it is disrespectful to the hard-
working men and women of our Border
Patrol.
To make matters worse, my same
colleague who is pushing this amend-
ment also wants to eliminate the De-
partment of Homeland Security.
Madam Chair, if you want to get rid
of DHS and you want to take away
DOD’s ability to help secure the bor-
der, who is going to be left to stop the
drug traffickers and the cartel mem-
bers who continue to infiltrate our
country in record numbers?
Madam Chair, this amendment is just
another step in the ongoing effort by
my colleagues across the aisle to make
us a country of open borders.
I urge all Members of the House to
stand up for the rule of law and reject
this amendment.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
I think it is important that we clarify

that in order to have a humane immi-
gration system, we do not require mili-
tarization or cruelty to children.
Asking that children not be caged
and asking that human beings’ rights—
human rights—be respected does not
mean ‘‘open borders.’’ It means that we
be a humane nation that respects our
mission as one that guarantees liberty,
prosperity, and the pursuit of happi-
ness for all people who live on Amer-
ican soil.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chair, I really take issue with the
characterization of militarization of
our border. I just told the gentlewoman
a few minutes ago that these people
don’t work on the border. When the
military goes down there, they are in
support positions to allow the profes-
sional Border Patrol agents to do their
jobs so that we can provide better care
for these individuals who are trying to
legally be processed.
There is no need for this. This is a
wrongheaded amendment.
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from New York (Ms. OCASIO-

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order

in part B of House Report 116–143.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
I present an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Add at the end of subtitle E of title 10 the
following:
SEC. ll. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR
PROVIDING HOUSING FOR UNDOCU-
MENTED ALIENS.
None of the funds authorized to be appro-
priated by this Act or otherwise made avail-
able for the Department of Defense may be
used for the purpose of providing housing in
any Department of Defense facility for any
detained alien who has no lawful immigra-
tion status in the United States.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 476, the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
this amendment prohibits the execu-
tive branch from using the authorized
funds to detain undocumented immi-
grants in Department of Defense facili-
ties.
One of the central aspects of the cri-
sis at our border is that the adminis-
tration is asking agencies and depart-
ments that are unprepared to house
and detain refugees and asylum seekers
when that is simply not what they are
trained or resourced to do.
This amendment will ensure that
military and migrant families alike
will not be forced into operating or liv-
ing in facilities never intended for
mass detention of human beings.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chair, I claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Madam Chair, the Border Patrol sta-
tions are at a breaking point. Every
station has been overcapacity for near-
ly all of 2019.
We have Border Patrol stations that
were designed for a maximum capacity
of 4,000 individuals. On a regular basis,
we have been having 20,000 people in
these facilities.
DHS has already apprehended more
than 390,000 illegal immigrant family
members in 2019, which is more than
triple last year. This explosion in fami-
lies coming across the border is a key
factor behind the current crisis. Smug-
glers are intentionally dumping groups
of over 100 people at a time in remote
areas to overwhelm Border Patrol
agents and resources.
House Democrats stalled a supple-
mental for weeks as children and fami-
lies languished in overcrowded stations
that were never designed for this kind
of crisis. Democrats are actively lim-
iting DHS’ ability to detain migrants,
which only fuels catch-and-release
policies that started the crisis to begin
with.
DOD has provided safe, secure, and
accountable housing for unaccom-
panied alien children in the past and
should absolutely have the option to
deal with them in the future.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
I think it is important for us to clarify
when we talk about ‘‘unaccompanied
children’’ whom the administration is
labeling an ‘‘unaccompanied child.’’
If a child comes with their grand-
mother, they are deemed unaccom-
panied. If the child comes with their
older brother or sister, they are
deemed unaccompanied. If a child
comes with a family member that is
anyone but their biological mother or
father, they are deemed unaccom-
panied. Their family is labeled as
human traffickers, often by the press
or otherwise.
I think it is important that we add a
cultural context to this conversation.
We have to reassert that seeking asy-
lum is not a crime. We should not be
expanding a system of detention and
criminalization of people who have
committed no crime and hurt no per-
son, aside from just simply trying to
seek asylum, which is their human
right.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Chair, first, I do want to make a point
that we are not just talking about un-
accompanied children here. The gentle-
woman’s amendment is not just lim-
ited to that.
The gentlewoman does make a point
that is correct, but I want to empha-
size why she is right. If they are not
with their legal parent or guardian, we
don’t know for sure whom that is they
are traveling with. They may say it is
their grandmother, but for all we
know, it is a sex trafficker or a drug
dealer who is just using the kid to get
into the States. We have on multiple
occasions had CBP notice the same
child coming through five, six times
with different ‘‘families.’’
If we are not sure that that is their
legal guardian or parent, yes, we are
going to find a way to separate them
until we can discern whether or not
that person should be traveling with
them.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman.
I think the process that the gentle-
woman is advocating in this amend-
ment, which I support, is not milita-
rizing the immigration system, par-
ticularly since the immigration system
is mostly civil.
Most of the migrants who are coming
across the border are asking for asy-
lum. If we would simply put in place a
process to be able to process the asy-
lum seekers and to increase the legal
process for them, then we wouldn’t
have to militarize the border by a de-
ployment of troops or by incarcerating
individuals in military facilities.
That can be a bipartisan effort. If we
join with my colleague to do com-
prehensive immigration reform, then
we will not need to utilize these facili-
ties. I agree that immigration does not
equal defense or criminalization.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. OCASIO-
CORTEZ).

Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 11, 2019 No. 116

The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Almighty God, who has given our
lawmakers diversities of talents by the
same spirit, use us for Your glory.
Lord, protect our Nation from evil.
Prevent the weapons formed against
America from prospering, for You re-
main our refuge and fortress. Continue
to be the strength of our lives, as we
remember the many times You have
preserved us in the past.
Lord, open our eyes to the unfolding
of Your providence. Open our minds to
Your truth. Open our lips to speak
Your wisdom.
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
TILLIS). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak for 1
minute as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
SWEET CORN DAYS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in
honor of the Iowa Department of Agri-
culture’s Sweet Corn Days yesterday, I
would like to highlight the strong agri-
cultural sector of my State of Iowa.
Many people don’t know how you get
from the seed to the corn on the cob
you are used to seeing on your dinner
table. That is one reason, particularly
for city people, that I started the
hashtag ‘‘Corn Watch’’ series on my
Instagram.
Each week I post an update with the
progress of how the crop is growing on
my farm in New Hartford, IA. It is a
small way to show nonfarmers how
Iowa feeds and fuels the world.
I yield the floor.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the leadership time
is reserved.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY

ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday the entire Senate had the oppor-
tunity to meet in classified session for
a briefing on election security. We
heard from the Director of National In-
telligence, the FBI Director, Acting
Secretary of the Department of Home-
land Security, and other key adminis-
tration officials about our recent
progress and ongoing work to protect
our democratic process from inter-
ference.
The takeaway was perfectly clear.
After 2016, this new administration
kicked into high gear. Alongside our
efforts in Congress, all levels of govern-
ment worked proactively to make sure
that 2018 was not a repeat of 2016.
Far from letting up, the executive
branch is continuing to work hard in
advance of next year’s Presidential
election. We know our adversaries will
not be letting up, so we aren’t letting
up either.
I want to underscore my appreciation
for the tremendous work that so many
officials across our government have
been doing to protect our democracy
and impose costs on adversaries who
dare to interfere. Threats remain, but
yesterday’s briefing was an instructive
counterpoint to the doom and gloom
hyperbole we often see in the media.
Good news doesn’t sell newspapers.
Although I doubt it would get much
coverage, I am proud of the work of our
government and what they have done
to shore up our defenses of American
democracy and deter foreign influence
and interference.
I believe our colleagues feel the same
way. At one point during yesterday’s
briefing, applause broke out in the
room for the work of one of our agen-
cies—bipartisan applause in the brief-
ing yesterday about what was done in
2018, after which it was largely incident
free.
Many of the details of yesterday’s
briefing were classified and should re-
main so, but much of what was dis-
cussed were the specific details and the
full impact of steps that are already
public knowledge.
Here in Congress, we have taken leg-
islative action to enhance interagency
coordination on cybersecurity, expe-
dite security clearances for election of-
ficials, and allocate hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in direct aid to State
election officials—direct aid to State
election officials.
With the new resources that we pro-
vided, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity dramatically strengthened its
information sharing and security part-
nerships with the State and local au-
thorities that operate elections in the
United States. Participation came
from all 50 States and 1,400 localities,
and the direct aid to States helped the
authorities who were on the frontlines
conducting elections update their sys-
tems, strengthen their defenses, and
maintain vigilance.
These and other actions have been
part of a coordinated, government-
wide, Federal, State, and local cam-
paign to shore up our defenses. I would
anticipate that every Member who at-
tended the classified briefing likely

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4780 July 11, 2019
came away feeling confident that big
steps forward have taken place in the
last 21⁄2 years.
Thanks in large part to these meas-
ures, the 2018 elections went more
smoothly than 2016, and as we look to
2020, it is encouraging to learn how se-
riously the administration is taking
the threat and proactively working to
counter it because we know the threat
is not going anywhere. Foreign adver-
saries are going to keep at it, so I am
glad the administration is so focused
on staying strong and remaining vigi-
lant.
Of course, as I said yesterday, the
roots of the issue run deeper than our
elections themselves. A foreign adver-
sary like Russia didn’t just wake up
one day in 2016 and decide to interfere
in the American democracy. The med-
dling was an outgrowth of a long pat-
tern of weakness and naivete that per-
meated all 8 years of the Obama admin-
istration.
Punching back against this mis-
behavior, and deterring future episodes
like it, has also meant taking broad
steps to strengthen America’s posture
abroad and to get more realistic about
our relationship with the Russians. Ob-
viously, nearly 30 Russians and Russian
corporations have been indicted by the
Special Counsel for election meddling.
More broadly, we have a new na-
tional security strategy—an improved
roadmap for our global presence that
takes seriously the need to check great
power competitors like Russia and
China.
We are recommitting to the alliances
that preserve American values around
the world, reforming NATO to meet
21st century threats, and equipping our
allies and partners who are on the
frontlines of Russia’s geopolitical
prospecting. Congress and the adminis-
tration have worked together to re-
store our Armed Forces and unwind
harmful funding restrictions that cut
readiness and limited our commanders.
So not just our efforts on election secu-
rity but, really, our entire foreign pol-
icy have made strides under the leader-
ship of this administration.
To conclude, yesterday’s briefing
made it clear that our work has led to
huge progress—huge progress—but the
work certainly isn’t over. Leaders
across government are continuing to
explore and repair potential vulnerabil-
ities and increase cooperation ahead of
the 2020 Presidential election. Congress
will certainly continue to monitor this
closely while resisting any efforts to
use the failures of the past to justify
sweeping federalizations of election
law, as some on the other side have
consistently sought to do.
Let me say that again. Congress will
certainly continue to monitor this
closely while resisting any efforts to
use the failures of the past to justify
sweeping federalizations of election
law, as some on the other side have
consistently sought to do.
Make no mistake, many of the pro-
posals labeled by Democrats to be
‘‘election security’’ are measures, in
fact, for election reform that are part
of the wish list of the left called the
Democrat politician protection act.
What they do is ignore the great
work this administration has done and
sweep under the rug the necessary
measures this Chamber has passed.
But speaking broadly, I think all
Americans should remember this: What
Russia really set out to do was to sow
division, spark doubt, and trigger a cri-
sis of confidence in our country that
would extend far beyond the actual ac-
tions that they undertook.
So as I have said before, as we con-
tinue taking action and shoring up our
defenses, it is also vital that we not
fall into precisely—precisely—the trap
that Putin and company have laid. It is
vital that Americans not take the bait
on fear and division and ultimately do
Russia’s work for them.
Our country is strong. American de-
mocracy is strong. Our elections are al-
ready safer and more secure, and the
important work continues. Our adver-
saries will not let up, so we are not let-
ting up either.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
another matter, all week the Senate
has continued our productivity in over-
coming partisan opposition and con-
firming the President’s well-qualified
nominees for important offices.
We have confirmed the newest judge
on the Ninth Circuit. Yesterday we
confirmed three district judges by
overwhelming bipartisan margins—78
to 15, 80 to 14, and 85 to 10. Those are
the margins on three district judges.
Clearly, we are not exactly talking
about radioactive, controversial nomi-
nees here, not when 78 votes for con-
firmation is the low end.
Nevertheless, as has become typical
over the past 21⁄2 years, our Democratic
colleagues insisted on cloture votes to
cut off debate before we could confirm
any of them. In fact, we have yet to
voice-vote a single judicial nominee
this entire Congress. We haven’t voice-
voted a single judicial nominee this en-
tire Congress.
It is really a shame. It is not the
precedent the Senate ought to be set-
ting for these lower tier nominations.
Of course, we have confirmed them
nonetheless.
Before the end of this week, the Sen-
ate will have done the same for three
other lower level nominees to the exec-
utive branch.
Weeks like this were impossible be-
fore my Republican colleagues and I
did the right thing for the institution a
few months back and moved the Senate
back toward our historic norms for
nominations of this sort. We argued
that Senate Democrats were mind-
lessly obstructing even the least con-
troversial nominees just for obstruc-
tion’s sake.
Our colleagues across the aisle in-
sisted, no, the majority would be ram-
ming through these extreme individ-
uals and cutting off intense debate that
these extreme nominees deserve. Well,
who is right? Well, one more time for
good measure: 78 to 15, 80 to 14, and 85
to 10. Enough said.
It is particularly ironic that some of
my friends across the aisle elect to
complain that the Senate is spending
too much time on nominations—the
Presiding Officer has heard that—
spending too much time on nomina-
tions. I am not making this up. We ac-
tually hear protestations from the
Democratic side that confirming these
men and women is taking too long, as
though it weren’t totally obvious to ev-
eryone that their own unprecedented
delaying tactics are the only reason
these nominees have not been quickly
confirmed in big batches on a voice
vote.
It is quite the two-step: Democrats
systemically drag their heels for 21⁄2
years and counting and then complain
we are not moving fast enough. Well, if
it weren’t clear by now, the tactics are
not going to work. The Senate is going
to press on. We are going to do our job.
Today, we will press on despite 492
days of obstruction—492 days of ob-
struction—and confirm Peter Wright,
the President’s nominee to serve as—
listen to this—an Assistant Adminis-
trator at EPA. He has been waiting for
492 days.
As it happens, we will also vote on
two Kentuckians—Robert King and
John Pallasch. Mr. King has been nom-
inated to serve as Assistant Secretary
for Postsecondary Education. He comes
with an impressive record of experience
in higher education administration and
advocacy at home in the Bluegrass
State and beyond. Mr. Pallasch has
been tapped for Assistant Secretary of
Labor. His résumé includes service as
director of the Kentucky Office of Em-
ployment and Training as well as pre-
vious service with the Department as
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Mine
Safety and Health.
I will be proud to support each of
these well-qualified nominees as their
senior Senator from Kentucky but
moreover as someone who believes that
the American President deserves to
have his team in place and that citi-
zens ought to be governed by the gov-
ernment they actually voted for.
Mr. President, I suggest the absence
of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4781
July 11, 2019
healthcare, free college, free debt re-
lief, free childcare, and free income.
The problem, of course, is that the old
adage ‘‘There is no such thing as a free
lunch’’ is 100 percent true.
Healthcare has to be paid for by
someone. College has to be paid for by
someone. Democrats, of course, think
they should all be paid for—and often
controlled—by the government, but
what they don’t like to talk about as
much is that the government has to
get its money from somewhere, and
that somewhere is the American peo-
ple.
If you ask Democrats how they are
going to pay for all of this free stuff,
what they will say is, they will tax the
rich. The problem is, there simply
aren’t enough people to even come
close to paying for the Democrats’ free
programs and expansive policy pro-
posals.
Every year, Forbes magazine reports
the combined net worth of the 400 rich-
est people in the United States, but if
you took every penny from every one
of those people, it would be a tiny drop
in the bucket next to the cost of the
Democrats’ proposals.
Free healthcare alone—and these are
my conservative estimates—would cost
$32 trillion over 10 years. Taking every
penny from the richest people in the
United States wouldn’t even cover 1
year of that proposal. In fact, you
could take every penny from every bil-
lionaire in the entire world, and it
would still only cover roughly 28 per-
cent or less than 3 years of Democrats’
Medicare for All proposal.
That is just free healthcare. That is
not the Green New Deal or guaranteed
income or free childcare or anything
else. What if we move away from bil-
lionaires? How about millionaires—
even millionaires? What if we taxed
every household in the United States
making more than $200,000 at a 100-per-
cent rate for 10 years? Well, we would
still barely have enough to cover free
healthcare, much less Democrats’
other proposals.
Let’s look at one of the Democrats’,
what I would say, relatively smaller
proposals, and that is student loan for-
giveness and free college. No one can
deny that student loan debt is a prob-
lem in this country. Many graduates
emerge with tens of thousands of dol-
lars’ worth of debt that they struggle
to repay, and it burdens them for
years. It is a growing problem. Ways to
alleviate this burden and encourage
more affordable education are con-
versations we need to have, but the
free college and debt elimination solu-
tions offered by two leading Demo-
cratic Senators are no solutions at all.
The U.S. Government is not swim-
ming in money. We are deeply in debt,
and we already need to shore up exist-
ing programs, like Social Security and
Medicare, both of which are on shaky
financial footing.
Paying for a college education for
millions of Americans is not something
the government can easily afford. The
Senator from Vermont’s plan for free
college and student loan forgiveness
would cost approximately $2.2 trillion
over 10 years. That may not sound like
much when compared to Democrats’
budget-busting plan for government-
run healthcare, but it is still a lot of
money.
The entire Federal budget for 2019 is
less than $5 trillion, and that is sup-
posing the Senator from Vermont’s
proposal comes in on budget, which
seems unlikely. For one thing, when
you offer something for free, demand
for it generally increases.
The Senator from Vermont is making
his estimate based on today’s numbers,
but what happens when demand sky-
rockets? The Federal Government can
be on the hook for far more than the
Senator estimates, and these proposals
would do anything but incentivize col-
leges and universities to lower the cost
of tuition.
Both the Senators who have proposed
free college and debt elimination plans
this year have said they will pay for it.
The Senator from Vermont would im-
pose a financial transactions tax, while
the Senator from Massachusetts would
impose what she calls an
ultramillionaire’s tax on the very
wealthy, but as one Wall Street Jour-
nal editor highlights in a recent col-
umn, this is unlikely to cover the
costs:
Financial-transaction taxes chronically
underperform estimates of the revenue
they’ll generate, and wealth taxes are so in-
effective that even France scrapped its
version in despair in 2017. Much heavier mid-
dle-class taxation is what feeds European so-
cial-welfare States.
It goes on to say: And ‘‘much heavier
middle-class taxation’’ is likely to be
the end result of Democratic proposals,
like free college and student loan for-
giveness.
Even leaving aside the cost, let’s talk
about the merits of the Democrats’
proposals—for starters, the sheer un-
fairness of these plans. Let’s suppose
one of these proposals becomes law.
Now, suppose you are someone who has
lived frugally for years, and you have
just finished paying off $30,000 in stu-
dent loans. You are not going to get a
penny back from the Democrats. Mean-
while, someone who has just incurred
that $30,000 in debt is going to get it
completely wiped out. There is no need
to live frugally or think about paying
off the debt you have freely incurred;
the debt will just be gone.
Then there is the fact that Demo-
cratic proposals for free college and
debt forgiveness are not going to solve
the education debt problem.
The director of the Education Policy
Program at New America—not a con-
servative think tank, by the way—re-
cently published a column in the New
York Times, where he noted that the
proposals for free public college from
the Senator from Vermont and the
Senator from Massachusetts would
‘‘not eliminate future student debt—
not even close. That’s because most
student loan debt isn’t taken out to at-
tend undergraduate programs at public
colleges and universities. Most loans
are used for private colleges, for-profit
colleges, and most of all, graduate
school.’’
As the column points out, that is not
something that free public under-
graduate education will fix. In fact, the
column notes: ‘‘The day after Senator
SANDERS ‘hits the reset button,’ as he
put it in the news conference, the na-
tional student debt odometer would
begin rapidly spinning again.’’
So what can be done to help those
struggling with student loan debt?
What can we do to help while still
maintaining fiscal responsibility and
preserving a respect for honoring the
commitments you have made? One
Democratic Senator and I have a pro-
posal that could definitely help. The
senior Senator from Virginia and I re-
introduced our Employer Participation
in Repayment Act earlier this year.
Our legislation would amend the Edu-
cational Assistance Program to permit
employers to make tax-free payments
on their employees’ student loans.
Right now, employers can contribute
to their employees’ tuition if their em-
ployees are currently taking classes,
but they can’t help employees with
education debts they have already in-
curred. Our bill would allow them to
help with employees’ already-existing
student loan debt.
This would be a win-win situation. It
would be a win for employees who
would get help paying off their student
loans, and it would be a win for em-
ployers which would have a new option
for attracting and retaining talented
workers. Our bill would not be a silver
bullet, but it would certainly help ease
the pain of paying back student loans
for a number of young Americans.
I also look forward to seeing other ef-
forts to help alleviate the burden of
student loan debt in a feasible and fis-
cally responsible way. I know Repub-
licans on the Senate Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee
are working on legislation to make it
easier to pay back student loans.
Another big thing we can do is to
make sure that graduates have access
to good-paying jobs. Thanks to Repub-
lican economic policies over the past 2
years, our economy is thriving, good
jobs are being created, and wages are
rising at the strongest pace in a dec-
ade. All of that can go a long way to-
ward enabling people to pay off their
debt, and Republicans are committed
to building on the economic success
that we are experiencing and expanding
opportunities even further.
‘‘Free College’’ makes a great bump-
er sticker, but it doesn’t make very
good policy. We need to address the
problem of student debt without weigh-
ing down the economy or hard-working
Americans with massive new govern-
ment spending and massive new taxes.
The Employer Participation in Repay-
ment Act is a step in the right direc-
tion, and I hope to see it receive a vote
in the very near future.

CHINA
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I
call to the Senators’ attention today a
disturbing article in the June 29, 2019,
issue of The Economist, on pages 36
and 37. It is about the military buildup
in China and the way it affects the
United States. It says:
Xi Jinping wants China’s armed forces to
be ‘‘world class’’ by 2050. He has done more
to achieve this than any of his predecessors.
I will quote from the lead of this arti-
cle in The Economist.
Over the past decade, the People’s Libera-
tion Army (PLA) has been lavished with
money and arms. China’s military spending
rose by 83 percent in real terms between 2009
and 2018, by far the largest growth spurt in
any big country. The splurge has enabled
China to deploy precision missiles and anti-
satellite weapons that challenge American
supremacy in the western Pacific. China’s
leader, Xi Jinping, says his ‘‘Chinese dream’’
includes a ‘‘dream of a strong armed forces’’.
That, he says, involves ‘‘modernising’’ the
PLA by 2035 and making it ‘‘world-class’’—in
other words, America-beating—by mid-cen-
tury. He has been making a lot of progress.
In the second column of this article,
it goes on to say:
He has done more in the past three years
to reform the PLA than any leader since
Deng Xiaoping.
This quote is not from some advocate
of defense spending but is from one of
the leading publications, The Econo-
mist.
I say to my colleagues, we need to be
mindful of the threat that is arising to
the United States from around the
globe—not only from China, as I have
just read, but also from Vladimir
Putin’s Russia, from Iran, and from
international terrorism. There is a de-
teriorating security situation in al-
most every sector of the globe. The
fact that the United States has always
been super supreme and able to defend
the free peoples of this world is being
challenged. We can no longer assume
that any war would never be a fair
fight. That has been the goal of the
United States if we have to go to war.
And we want to avoid war. But the best
way, in our judgment, as a national
strategy down through the decades, to
avoid conflict of any kind is to make
sure that if America ever gets in a
fight, it will not be a fair fight; it will
be a fight where we have overwhelming
superiority, so no one will dare chal-
lenge the sea lanes and the freedom
that we stand for in the United States
of America. That is being challenged
today.
I would submit to you that it is a
good time for the United States to
point out that we passed the National
Defense Authorization Act—the
NDAA—on a huge bipartisan basis. It
was 80-something votes to 8. It is just
unbelievable, the way we came to-
gether under the leadership of Chair-
man INHOFE and Ranking Member
REED, his Democratic counterpart,
working together as professionals, as
legislators, and as Americans to send a
strong statement that we need to go
from the $700 billion that was spent
last fiscal year to $750 billion to give
our troops the pay raise they need, to
recognize the sacrifice they have made,
and to give our military—the Army,
Navy, Air Force, and Marines—the
tools they need, the equipment they
need, and the innovation and manufac-
turing they need to get us where we
need to go.
We went through a 7- or 8-year period
when—we ought to all be ashamed be-
cause our fingerprints are all on it,
those of us who were in office at the
time. The distinguished Presiding Offi-
cer was not a Member of the Senate at
that time, but those of us who were, we
got our fingerprints on it, Republicans
and Democrats. Somehow, try though
we might, say what we might, we were
unable to prevent sequestration from
happening—an unthinkable result. The
military branches couldn’t believe this
was happening and couldn’t believe
Congress would be so irresponsible, but
somehow we were.
We have righted the ship over the
past 2 years. It would be unthinkable
to me, my fellow Americans, after
making the progress to get back on the
right track and return to responsible
defense spending and responsible stew-
ardship of our national security, if
somehow we heeded some voices we
have been hearing in Washington, DC,
and around the country during the past
few days about a continuing resolution,
perhaps—maybe a continuing resolu-
tion of an entire year. The thinking
there is, well, we just do a continuing
resolution, and that will amount to
level spending, and we can live with
that.
I just left a hearing on the confirma-
tion of GEN Mark Milley as the next, I
hope, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, and I asked him about that.
Would a continuing resolution simply
be level spending, and might we be able
to live with that? And he absolutely
made the point which we all know if we
study the law. It is way more than
level spending. It stops innovation. It
stops the new starts. It stops every-
thing that we planned in the NDAA,
which we passed with an overwhelming
bipartisan vote, and it makes it
against the law for the shipbuilders to
do anything new and for the people
working on our next-generation air-
craft to do anything new. It stops them
in their tracks. It creates uncertainty
in every branch of the military. And
then we have to pay millions and bil-
lions to get back going again. It is an
unthinkable result. Surely we can
avoid that as Republicans and Demo-
crats.
Let me quote now-retired Secretary
Mattis. When he was asked about this
very subject on a recent occasion, Sec-
retary Mattis said this:
I cannot overstate the impact to our
troops’ morale from all this uncertainty. The
combination of rapidly changing technology,
the negative impact on military readiness
resulting from the longest continuous
stretch of combat in our Nation’s history,
and insufficient funding have created an
overstretched and under-resourced military.
According to Secretary Mattis,
‘‘Under continuing resolutions, we ac-
tually lose ground.’’
We need a budget deal. We need a
2-year budget deal, as we have had in
the past. Give our defense leaders, the
Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries,
as well as the ones who put on the uni-
form and agreed, for a career, to put
themselves in harm’s way—give them
the certainty they need in order to de-
fend against the threats The Econo-
mist talked about and the threats Gen-
eral Mattis talked about. Give them
that certainty.
A new CR—a continuing resolution—
would prevent us from having that cer-
tainty. It would delay maintenance for
the Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier. It
would prevent a guided missile frigate
program we already authorized from
even starting. This would happen Sep-
tember 30 if we go to a continuing reso-
lution. It would cripple research and
development, and it would prevent the
Pentagon from aligning its funding
with upcoming priorities.
We need to realize a fact of life
around here. I didn’t exactly get my
way in the election last November. If I
had my druthers, the House of Rep-
resentatives would have remained in
Republican hands, with a Republican
Speaker and a Republican Chair. The
voters, in their wisdom, decided to vote
for divided government last November.
Our team was elected to continue
leadership in the U.S. Senate. The
Democratic team was elected to leader-
ship in the House of Representatives.
And I can assure you, if I were writing
a defense appropriations bill, which is
half of discretionary spending, and all
of the other appropriations bills, which
is so-called nondefense discretionary,
it would look far different from the bill

Speaker NANCY PELOSI proposes to
write. I can assure you that it would
look different and that we would have
less domestic spending. But the fact of
life is that MITCH MCCONNELL, the Re-
publican leader, is the one who guides
legislation here in the Senate, and
NANCY PELOSI, a Democrat from Cali-
fornia, is the one who guides legisla-
tion on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives, and if we get a bill
passed, we are going to have to get a
compromise bill passed. If anybody
within the sound of my voice doesn’t
realize this, they don’t understand gov-
ernment. They don’t understand the
dynamics that have taken place since
Philadelphia in 1776 and Philadelphia
again in 1787, where give-and-take had
to occur, but we moved things along
for the greater good.
We can come to an agreement, or we
can show ourselves to Vladimir Putin’s
Russia as unable to govern adequately,
and we can show ourselves to Xi
Jinping’s China as unable to make the
tough decisions to protect Americans.
We have that choice, and we have a
willingness on this side of the aisle and
on the other side of the aisle. I was
with some of my Democratic and Re-
publican friends from the other body
just yesterday. I think there is the
willingness there. We are going to have
to have an agreement that the admin-
istration will sign on to because the
President’s signature has to be affixed
to this.
Now is the time—July 11, 2019—to get
this decision made, before we leave for
August. I would hope we wouldn’t leave
for August until we get that number
agreed to. We come back after Labor
Day, and then it is brinksmanship, and
then suddenly it is shutdown city, and
that is being threatened. Russia knows
this, the Iranian leadership knows this,
and China knows this. Let’s do it now.
So I call on the Democratic and Re-
publican leadership in the House, I call
on our leadership, and I call on our
President to get down to business in
the next few days. Let’s go ahead and
make this decision that we know will
eventually have to be made, make a re-
sponsible decision and send a message
to the rest of the world that we intend
to take care of our security.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, first
of all, let me say that I couldn’t agree
more with the Senator from Mis-
sissippi, Mr. WICKER, than I do. His
points are exactly right. A democracy
is finding a way forward. It is not find-
ing your way forward necessarily. It is
obviously finding as much of your way
forward as you can find. But it is find-
ing a way forward.
Clearly, a top priority of the Federal
Government is to defend the country.
It is my top priority. I think I would be
safe in suggesting it is Senator
WICKER’s top priority. And it is an im-
portant priority for our friends on the
other side, but it may not be quite the
same priority on the other side.
For this to work, the House and the
Senate have to work together and the
White House has to work together to
come up with just that spending num-
ber. Once we have the number that we
are going to spend, having the debate
on the floor is suddenly possible.
I am fully in agreement with that,
but I want to talk for a few minutes
today about a program that we need to
extend for a short period of time to get
it extended to the end of this spending
year.
MENTAL HEALTH
Madam President, I know the minor-
ity leader, the Democratic leader, just
arrived, and he has heard a lot about
this program from my friend Senator
STABENOW. The excellence in mental
health program—something we started
2 years ago. We passed legislation in
2014. We have come to the end of the
first 2 years of that trial program. I
want to talk more about why we need
a longer term expansion of that trial,
but first of all, we need to get a 3-
month extension to get us to the end of
this spending year.
I am always glad to talk about this
program because what it does is it real-
ly begins to close the gap between how
we talk about physical health and how
we talk about mental health. Some-
where between one in four and one in
five adult Americans, according to the
National Institutes of Health, has a
mental health problem that is
diagnosable and almost always treat-
able, but less than half of the people
who have that problem actually receive
the care they need. These are people
who are our neighbors, our family
members, and our colleagues.
There is no stigma to seeking care,
and society needs to do a better job—as
I believe this program is helping us to
do—talking about mental health like
all other health.
On the last day of October 2013, on
the 50th anniversary of the Community
Mental Health Act, which was the last
bill President Kennedy signed into law
in 1963, Senator STABENOW and I came
to the floor to talk about that 1963 bill
and how many things have been closed
down because of that bill and how
many things have not been opened to
replace them when that happened.
In the decades that followed, about
half of the proposed community health
centers that bill anticipated just sim-
ply were never built, and the facilities
used for people who had substantial
mental health challenges were closed.
What really happened over these 50
years is that the emergency room and
local law enforcement became the de
facto mental health system for the
country, and nobody has been well
served by that, including law enforce-
ment, emergency rooms, and most im-
portantly, people with mental health
challenges and their families.
The Excellence in Mental Health Act
was signed into law in 2014 to try to
begin to address that problem. What
the bill did was it created a 2-year,
eight-State pilot program that would
provide mental health care at locations
that met the standards, just like any
other help would be provided. These
would be certified community behav-
ioral health clinics that would have,
among other things, 24/7 crisis services
available, outpatient mental health
and substance abuse treatment, imme-
diate screenings, risk assessments, and
diagnoses available, and care coordina-
tion, including partnerships with emer-
gency rooms, the law enforcement
community, and veterans groups. All of
that would have to be done in order to
be part of that eight-State pilot. Twen-
ty-four States initially applied. Nine-
teen States went through the entire
process. Eight States were chosen, in-
cluding Missouri.
Among other things, our State par-
ticipated in the Emergency Room En-
hancement Project. This is a project
that is designed to identify people who
present themselves at the emergency
room as people who really need treat-
ment for addiction issues and mental
health issues, not other health issues,
and then get them to a place where
that treatment is going to be much
more appropriate than it is likely to be
at the emergency room.
In just 6 months of working with the
emergency room, law enforcement, and
mental health services in our State, we
think there has been a reduction in
homelessness of people who came to
the emergency room of about 72 per-
cent and a reduction in emergency
room visits of 72 percent. Unemploy-
ment was reduced by 14 percent among
the people who have gone to the emer-
gency room with a mental health con-
cern, and law enforcement contact was
reduced by 59 percent.
So we have 2 years of study that indi-
cates where we have gotten in our
State, and I think other States are see-
ing similar kinds of numbers. I have
been to clinics all over our State and
have talked with those who have dealt
with this. I talked particularly to law
enforcement people all over our State,
who have seen the change in the people
they are dealing with and the options
they have available. Suddenly, the op-
tion is not just to go to somebody’s
house at a crisis moment in the middle
of the night and be taken to the emer-
gency room for one night to have that
problem solved; the option is actually
to go somewhere where your mental
health challenge is being dealt with,
just like if you had a heart attack or a
kidney problem or some other problem.
That is why we have introduced leg-
islation to extend this for another 2
years and, if money is available in the
pay-for we have proposed, to see wheth-
er we can add more States to the pro-
gram.
When we announced this new legisla-
tion, Laura Heebner, who is with Com-
pass Health systems in Missouri, was
one of the people who joined us. She
said that in the past, before this pro-
gram was able to help in our State,
roughly half of the people who sought
an appointment from their mental

health facility could not get scheduled
for several days, sometimes several
weeks, and half of the people didn’t
come back. If a person shows up that
one time and says ‘‘I am here because
I have a real problem and I need help’’
and the answer is ‘‘We are not going to
help you today; we are not going to do
an evaluation right now,’’ more often
than not or as often as not, they don’t
come back. So at Compass Health, as
well as many of our other certified
clinics in our State, we increased ac-
cess. We established same day walk-ins
to attempt to look at their problem
and see if they needed help that day or
could, in fact, come back a few days
later for an extensive visit. At that fa-
cility and others, everybody is being
seen when they come in. The suicide
care path they established has reduced
suicides by 70 percent since last year.
I will make two quick points as I
conclude.
No. 1, the goal of this program is not
for the Federal Government to take
over the behavioral health costs of the
country; the goal of this program is to
look at mental health and keep track
of 24 or 25 other healthcare markers
and decide how much other healthcare
is impacted in a positive and, in fact, a
cost-saving way if you are dealing with
mental health at the same time.
The second point I would make is
that we need to see Congress step up in
the next few days and extend the cur-
rent program through the end of this
spending year, and then let’s have a de-
bate about why 2 more years of putting
all that information together gives
States and communities the informa-
tion they need to find out. As a result,
I believe everybody will understand
that it is not only the right thing to
do, but fiscally it is the smart thing to
do. By dealing with mental health like
all other health, the overall healthcare
cost of that big mental health commu-
nity goes down dramatically if you are
seeing your doctor, showing up for your
appointments, and taking your medi-
cine. Our other problems are much
more easily managed when adding the
cost of mental healthcare to all our
other healthcare priorities. It isn’t just
the right thing to do, it is the smart
thing to do.
Hopefully the Congress will deal with
that and the Senate can take a leader-
ship role in dealing with that. The
House has already sent us a bill. We
need to respond to that by doing the
two things I just mentioned. Let’s
treat mental health like we treat all
other health.
I yield the floor.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
first, let me thank my friend from Mis-
souri for what he and Senator STABE-
NOW are trying to do on mental health.
I know some States were included and
other States were not, so I support that
aspect of what he was talking about.
2020 CENSUS
Madam President, later today, Presi-
dent Trump will give a news conference
in the Rose Garden about his attempts
to create an Executive order to add
citizenship questions to the 2020 cen-
sus. That is outrageous. It is out-
rageous substantively, and it is out-
rageous because this President has so
little respect for the rule of law. He
thinks he can just issue Executive or-
ders and go around the Congress, go
around established law, and try to
bully the courts. I believe he will be
thwarted by the courts, and this will be
a real test of John Roberts and the Su-
preme Court, whether they stand for
the rule of law or are always looking
for an excuse to move the country
rightward. We will see.
Today, the Trump administration
has provided no legitimate legal ra-
tionale for adding this question to the
census. Just yesterday, the New York
Times reported that Justice Depart-
ment lawyers ‘‘resigned from the law-
suit out of ethical concerns and a belief
that the suit was unwinnable.’’
Well, we all know what is going on.
The Trump administration doesn’t
have a legitimate legal rationale. The
true motivation was even clear before
the papers of that deceased designer of
this question came to light. The true
rationale is blatantly political and
self-serving. President Trump wants to
include the citizenship question to in-
timidate minorities—particularly
Latinos—from answering the census so
that it undercuts those communities
and Republicans can redraw congres-
sional districts to their advantage.
The Census Bureau itself determined
weeks ago that including such a ques-
tion would result in a significant
undercount. That alone is enough for
disqualification. That is not what the
Constitution says—manipulate the cen-
sus so you don’t get an accurate count.
The President knows this. Yet he con-
tinues to pursue a cynical idea—typical
of the President—cynical and against
minorities, with no respect for the rule
of law, mores, and values that made
this country great. Day by day, he de-
stroys them. Day by day.
The President’s action is nothing
more than a naked political power
grab, which is one of the few things he
is good at as President. It shows once
again just how little respect the Presi-
dent has for our democracy. It is also
one prong in the Trump administra-
tion’s multifaceted attack on commu-
nities of color. They are doing another
one today in addition to this, which I
will speak about in a minute.
Let’s not forget that the census is a
constitutional mandate. It has been
conducted impartially by Democratic
and Republican administrations alike
since 1790. It should be beyond the
reach of partisan politics. But this
President has such disdain for con-
stitutional law norms and the rule of
law that he will try anything to set the
rules to his advantage, even if it means
circumventing Congress and circum-
venting the courts. This is what dic-
tators do in banana republics. They try
to change the rules to consolidate po-
litical power no matter what their con-
stitutions and rule of law say. The
President is moving us in that direc-
tion, and our Republican colleagues are
supine. They say nothing. Many of
them know what he is doing is wrong,
and knees clatter because they are too
afraid to tell the President he is wrong.
The American people should be out-
raged about this. Republican Senators
should be outraged about this, but, like
so many other instances in which the
President subverts our Democratic
norms, the silence from Republicans in
Congress has been deafening and de-
grading to the very fabric of this won-
derful democracy that the President
day by day tries—usually unsuccess-
fully, thank God—to undo.
IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT
Madam President, on the ICE raids,
last night the New York Times re-
ported another thing President Trump
was trying to do—ordering ICE to re-
sume plans to carry out nasty deporta-
tion raids over the weekend. His plan
will tear families apart and disrupt im-
migrant communities across America,
including immigrants here legally and
those in the process of legally applying
for asylum. Cruelty. Cruelty seems to
be the point of these raids. This is not
an effort to root out dangerous individ-
uals. This is an act of brutish force de-
signed to spread fear in the immigrant
community. Steve Miller whispers in
the President’s ear: Treat them cru-
elly. Make them afraid, and maybe
they will not come.
They are going to come. The dangers
in their home countries are much
worse. What would any citizen do in
America or any other place in the
world if a gang came to you and said: I
am going to rape your daughter unless
you do what I want; I am going to kill
your son; I am going to burn your
House—you would flee.
These are not criminals. They are
people trying to preserve their fami-
lies, their children, their lives. Yet the
President—egged on by some of the
rightwing news media—tries to make
Americans believe they are all crimi-
nals. Sure, if one of these folks is a
bank robber or a burglar or hurts
somebody, they should be out—one,
two, three.
If they are simply trying to escape
brutality, we still should have rule of
law, but they should be treated with
some decency, honor, and humanity.
That has been the American tradition
for some 200-odd years.
The President’s policy is not only
cruel—that is the worst of it—but it is
brainless. When it comes to intel-
ligently using our immigration re-
sources, the administration should
focus on the small minority that are
actually criminals, not families and
not 10-year-olds.

July 11, 2019
These raids will not make America
safer. They will not solve our immigra-
tion challenges for the reasons I men-
tioned. They will, instead, terrorize in-
nocent families and rip children away
from their parents. I warn President
Trump, the pictures of these raids
aren’t going to be pretty. Average
Americans who may agree with him on
many issues will be appalled.
President Trump, you are going to
have to back off from this cruel policy
because the American people are a lot
better than you. They will see the pic-
tures. What are they going to do with
a father driving his child to school?
Will they stop the car, pull the father
out? They have done that. Will they let
the 8-year-old sit in the car trauma-
tized? They have done that.
President Trump, mark my words,
there will be a huge backlash against
this. The American people are not
cruel like you in this regard.
I would plead with the President to
call off these raids. We Democrats have
proposed real solutions to the same mi-
gration problems that will stop the in-
flux or greatly reduce the influx at the
border. We would simply say: Let these
would-be immigrants from Nicaragua
and El Salvador and Honduras apply
for asylum and beef up the number of
immigration judges so they can get an
adjudication quickly. If they are
turned down, they can’t come. Tough
luck. If they get asylum, they should
be welcomed here as America has al-
ways welcomed people, as that great
Lady in the Harbor of the city I come
from has done for centuries. That is
the solution.
We should also help these countries
go after the gangs that are making the
people flee. Go after MS–13 down there.
Go after the drug dealers. Go after the
coyotes. It was working in the last few
months of the Obama administration
and even the first few months of the
Trump administration, until the Presi-
dent rescinded the policy because he
got mad at somebody, which is typical
of how he operates. That is what we
should do.
Until then, when these folks get to
the border, I call on the President to
work with us to put an end to the cru-
elty that the migrants are being shown
when they come into U.S. custody.
They are a small percentage of the peo-
ple in this country. It is not a large
number in terms of our total popu-
lation.
Another round of reports this week
describes the horrid conditions endured
by migrant children at our border. Fa-
cilities built for no more than 100 peo-
ple are now housing up to 700 children.
Many have nothing to sleep on, no
change of clothes, and sometimes not
enough food. These are reports from
the President’s own executive agencies,
not from someone outside. In Arizona,
these kids are reportedly being abused.
CBP agents use racist slurs, deprive
them of sleeping mats and, in one case,
according to the report, potentially as-
saulted a 15-year-old girl. It is bar-
baric. It is not American.
We need to put an end to this behav-
ior now. We have just passed a supple-
mental appropriations bill to provide
more resources to improve conditions
and speed the asylum process, but it
didn’t go far enough. That is why, later
today, I will join with my colleagues
Senators MERKLEY and FEINSTEIN to in-
troduce the Stop Cruelty to Migrant
Children Act. This new legislation
would establish mandatory standards
for the appropriate and humane treat-
ment of children. It would make it
easier for children to be connected with
sponsors and legal counsel, and it
would, once and for all, end the inhu-
mane practice of separating families,
pulling children—even little children—
away from their parents. Democrats
have been fighting for these provisions
for months. We were able to secure
some of them in the last border supple-
mental, but unfortunately our Repub-
lican colleagues blocked many addi-
tional provisions from going into the
bill. This new legislation marks a clear
bright line of what is left to be done.
Now the only question that looms is,
Will Leader MCCONNELL finally stand
up for the children and work with us to
pass these new standards into law?
I want to thank Senators MERKLEY
and FEINSTEIN for working on this very
important bill. It is a necessary step to
restoring America’s moral credibility.
A nation as powerful as ours has no
need or right to treat the weak and suf-
fering this way. We can deal with our
immigration issues with dignity, com-
mon sense, and rule of law. The bill is
how we get that done.
CHINA
Madam President, yesterday it was
reported that President Trump told
President Xi of China that the United
States would tone down its criticism of
Beijing’s approach to Hong Kong in
order to revive our trade negotiations.
If these reports are true, once again,
President Trump has made another
error when it comes to China, for two
reasons. First, it is crucial always for
the United States to stand up for de-
mocracy, human rights, and civil lib-
erties everywhere—to be the ‘‘shining
city upon a hill’’ that John Winthrop
talked about 375 years ago. From
Tiananmen Square to Tibet, from the
brutal suppression of the Muslim mi-
nority Uighurs to the recent protests
in Hong Kong, China’s human rights
record has been an abomination. They
want to join the family of nations and
be treated equally, but in some ways
they are like a Third World dictator-
ship.
America used to champion religious
rights, minority rights, and democratic
values abroad. It helped us in immeas-
urable ways, not just morally but eco-
nomically and politically. It gave us
strength. It gave us the moral high
ground that the Scriptures have always
said was important in human dealings.
Unfortunately, under this President,
that doesn’t happen.
Second, the idea that going easy on
China’s human rights record will ease
trade talks is exactly backward. I
know China. They respond to strength,
not flattery or capitulation. Every
time the President gives in to Presi-
dent Xi, President Xi smells weakness
and says: I can get more out of the
Americans.
I generally am supportive of the
President on a tough policy toward
China on trade. China has ripped us off
over and over again, but the way to win
is to show strength. On some days, the
President does, and a week later he
backs off. There is no consistency. The
Chinese smell that they can outfox the
President. Backing off from fully tell-
ing Huawei they can’t operate was a
huge mistake. Huawei, with these ex-
ceptions, if they are given broadly, will
gain economic strength. Huawei is a
national security problem, but it is
also a trade problem. When China
steals our intellectual property, as
Huawei has done, why do we then allow
them to come into this country when
they don’t allow our best tech compa-
nies to go into theirs? It is ridiculous.
The President’s instincts are right,
but he is never consistent about them.
The way to speed successful trade
talks, where America secures real and
enduring concessions, is to keep the
full-court press on Beijing, on human
rights, on foreign policy, and certainly
on trade. President Trump must not be
weak on China for the sake of Amer-
ica’s role as a champion of democracy
and for the sake of driving China to ac-
cept meaningful reforms to its preda-
tory trade policies.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SCOTT of Florida).
The Senator from Illinois.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. DURBIN. I want to thank my
colleague and friend, the Democratic
leader, Senator SCHUMER, for raising
the issues of immigration.
We are at a moment in the history of
this country that I am sure will be re-
viewed and reflected upon for many
generations to come. Decisions that
are being made in the White House
today in the area of immigration will
be criticized, analyzed, and in many
cases repudiated in years to come. It is
time for us, at this moment, to have a
sober reflection on what this adminis-
tration has done in 21⁄2 years with the
issue of immigration and where we
stand at this very moment.
This President came to the White
House promising he was going to get
tough on immigration—immigration.
Probably at the heart of America, more
than anything, has been the issue of
immigration. We are a nation of immi-
grants. My mother was an immigrant
to this country.
I believe the diversity of our Nation
is one of our core strengths because we
have attracted people from all over the
world. This President doesn’t under-
stand it. If he does, he is not pushing
policies that show any reflection on
that reality and that historic back-
ground.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4786 July 11, 2019
Think of how this administration
started. Within hours after this Presi-
dent was elected, he announced the
Muslim travel ban; that he would sin-
gle out countries with Muslim-major-
ity populations and say that their peo-
ple were not welcome in the United
States. The reaction was immediate
across the United States. In the city of
Chicago, I can remember the sup-
porters of those coming from other
countries heading out to O’Hare and
attorneys volunteering to give them
counsel. There was an outpouring of
support for these people, realizing that
fundamentally innocent people were
traveling to this country. Yet the
President, with his travel ban, made it
clear from the very start of his admin-
istration his view on these immigrants.
What followed from there was a deci-
sion by this administration to elimi-
nate temporary protective status.
Three hundred thousand immigrants in
this country came here because of nat-
ural disasters and political upheaval
and got protection in the United
States. The President wanted to turn
them away. Was there any measure-
ment as to which ones might be dan-
gerous? No. All would be turned away.
Then, of course, there was the Presi-
dent’s decision to eliminate the DACA
Program. The DACA Program was cre-
ated by President Obama. These people
were brought to the United States as
children because of decisions by their
parents. They grew up in this country,
and every day in classrooms they
pledged allegiance to that flag, believ-
ing it was their flag too. At some point
in their lives, they learned they were
undocumented. They didn’t have legal
status in America. President Obama
felt—and I, as a sponsor of the Dream
Act, agreed with and encouraged the
creation by Executive order of the
DACA Program. So 790,000 of these
young people came forward, paid a fil-
ing fee, went through a criminal back-
ground check, and after they were ap-
proved, they were given 2 years to stay
in the United States, renewable, where
they couldn’t be deported, and they
could work legally in this country.
That program, as I said, attracted
790,000 successful applicants, many of
them outstanding students and amaz-
ing young people. I told their stories on
the floor of the Senate. President
Trump decided to abolish that program
and to end the protection for these
young people—790,000 of them.
That wasn’t the end of it. The Presi-
dent continued with policies such as
zero tolerance. Do you remember that
one? Last year, the Attorney General
of the United States stood up and
quoted from the Bible as to how it was
the right thing to do to separate 2,880
infants, toddlers, and children from
their parents at our borders. Zero tol-
erance; treat the parents like criminals
and separate the kids.
What was worse was that no effort
was made to track those children as to
where they were placed and what hap-
pened to their parents. It wasn’t until
a Federal judge in Southern California
came forward and forced this adminis-
tration to finally match up the chil-
dren with their parents that the effort
was undertaken, and still more than
100 of them were never matched—lost
in the bureaucratic sea of the Trump
administration. That wasn’t the end of
it by far.
What we have seen at the border in
the last several months has been
shocking and unprecedented in Amer-
ican history. This ‘‘get tough’’ Presi-
dent, who says he is going to cut off
foreign aid to countries in Central
America and get tough at the border
with his almighty wall, has ended up
attracting larger numbers of people
who are presenting themselves for asy-
lum status at the border of the United
States than we have ever seen—dra-
matic increases we haven’t seen for
decades with regard to the number of
people at the border. The President’s
immigration policy has backfired.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak for an ad-
ditional 2 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. DURBIN. The net result of this
has been the announcement by the ad-
ministration that, come Sunday, we
will see mass arrests and deportations
in this country. Reports from the New
York Times are that thousands will be
rounded up, arrested, and deported.
When possible, they say, family mem-
bers will be arrested together and will
be held in family detention centers.
Have these people committed crimes
since they have been in the United
States? There is no evidence of it. It is
simply the fact that they are undocu-
mented at this moment, and many of
them may have lived here for years.
These arrests and mass deportations
are going to create fear in commu-
nities across the United States, includ-
ing in the city of Chicago, which I am
honored to represent. For what? It will
not make America safer for us if we de-
port these people. Sadly, it is going to
mean that their families will be torn
apart and that there will be more chil-
dren and families in detention.
We were told there was a humani-
tarian crisis and that we needed to
apply ourselves and make certain that
we had billions of dollars to deal with
it, and we did. Now the administration
has turned around and announced a
new wave of splitting up families and
deporting them from the United
States. This is not what America is all
about. There is a way for us to deal
with immigration in a sensible,
thoughtful, rational way. Cruelty has
no place in the history of this country,
and it has no place when it comes to
the treatment of those who are in the
United States today.
I yield the floor.

MISSING PERSONS AND UNIDENTIFIED REMAINS
ACT
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, to-
morrow I will join some of my col-
leagues from the Senate Judiciary
Committee, as well as the Vice Presi-
dent, for a trip to McAllen, TX. It is a
beautiful city, nestled in the heart of
the Rio Grande Valley.
This region is home to a lot of his-
tory, a vibrant culture, and people
whose generosity has made national
headlines over the last period of time
as they have worked to manage the hu-
manitarian crisis that has ended up on
their doorstep.
For each of the past 4 months, more
than 100,000 migrants have crossed our
southern border and presented them-
selves to the Border Patrol. This has
placed an unbelievable strain on Fed-
eral, State, and local law enforcement,
as well as the cities, the counties, and
nongovernmental organizations that
have tried to step in to help.
After 10 weeks from the point when it
was requested by the President, Con-
gress finally passed a bipartisan bill to
provide funding for the Federal depart-
ments and agencies working to manage
this crisis and make $30 million avail-
able as reimbursement to local govern-
ments for paying bills that legiti-
mately and fairly should be those of
the Federal Government. This is an im-
portant step to help manage this hu-
manitarian crisis, but it is far from a
permanent solution. You can say we
are really dealing with the effects and
not the causes. The truth is, we need to
pass legislation in Congress that makes
lasting changes to our immigration
system, particularly our system where-
by people apply for and receive asylum,
so we can prevent this humanitarian
crisis from becoming the norm.
We can run, but we cannot hide from
the fact that only Congress can solve
this problem. To that end, I have intro-
duced bipartisan legislation called the
HUMANE Act, with my friend and col-
league in the House, HENRY CUELLAR,
that would make significant progress
in doing exactly that. This is the only
bipartisan, bicameral bill that I believe
would help staunch the flow of human-
ity across the border and deal with the
underlying causes. Our bill would close
a major loophole that is being ex-
ploited by the human smugglers that
serves as a pull factor for those who
want to come to the United States ille-
gally. It would also ensure that mi-
grants in our custody receive the prop-
er care and streamline the processing
of those who cross our border. It is an
important step to address this crisis at
its source as well as to provide relief
for folks along the entire U.S.-Mexico
border who have been impacted. We
need to pass this bill and pass it quick-
ly and get it to the President’s desk for
his signature.
While the compassionate response of
our local communities has become na-
tional news in recent months, Texans

have long known they have been the
ones left alone to step up to assist mi-
grants who arrived in poor health,
many times with nothing but the
clothing on their back. They provide
warm meals, a safe place to sleep, and
some of the basic necessities of life be-
fore these individuals head off to com-
munities across the United States
where they await their court dates
with immigration judges.
Sadly, those of us who live in border
States have also seen the toll this
treacherous journey takes on migrants,
and we have had to face the dark re-
ality that many don’t survive the jour-
ney from Central America across Mex-
ico into the United States. Migrants
travel with human smugglers known as
‘‘coyotes,’’ who are all too willing to
leave their customers for dead if they
become sick or injured. I have seen
photos and, of course, heard heart-
breaking stories from the Border Pa-
trol, as well as local officials and
ranchers, about finding the remains on
ranches or open terrain along the bor-
der of those who died in the desert try-
ing to make their way to the United
States.
I have been to Sacred Heart Ceme-
tery in Brooks County, TX, near the
Falfurrias checkpoint, where I saw
graves of these unknown who are la-
beled with terms like ‘‘skull case,’’
‘‘bones,’’ and ‘‘unknown female.’’
Here is a chart of a photograph de-
picting one of those graves. As you can
see, it is marked ‘‘unknown male.’’ Lit-
erally, the remains are identified not
by the name but, in this case, by the
sex, obviously listing the fact that
they are unknown.
This is not a rare occurrence. While
exact figures are hard to find, there is
no question that thousands of migrants
have died while attempting to enter
the United States illegally. It is one of
the toughest parts of the job for Border
Patrol, and it takes a toll on commu-
nities as well that are obligated to do
what is right to ensure the dignity of
the deceased.
The process of identifying these re-
mains is expensive, and it also often
falls on local taxpayers, like the tax-
payers of Brooks County, TX. Frankly,
they don’t have the tax base and can’t
afford to deal with this without our
help. We know they have limited staff
and budgets, and it puts serious strain
on local resources. It is an issue I have
worked on for a number of years.
I will soon be reintroducing a bill I
authored last year to provide some re-
lief. It is called the Missing Persons
and Unidentified Remains Act. It will
provide local jurisdictions with the re-
sources they need to identify the re-
mains of those who died along the bor-
der and solve missing persons cases.
This bill will expand the eligibility for
jurisdictions to receive grants through
Jennifer’s Law and make desperately
needed funds available. With this ex-
pansion, State and local governments,
forensic labs, medical examiners, non-
profits, and others will be eligible to
receive funding to support their work.
They will be able to use these grant
funds to support transportation, proc-
essing, identification, and reporting.
These funds can also be used to hire
additional analysts, technicians, and
examiners to support identification as
well as purchase the necessary state-of-
the-art equipment.
This legislation would take steps to
improve the recording and reporting of
missing persons and unidentified re-
mains, which is a major challenge, par-
ticularly when it comes to notifying
family members.
I have the great honor of rep-
resenting more than 28 million Texans.
I know that in order to do my job—as
all of us attempt to do—we need to lis-
ten to our constituents and act on sug-
gestions they make to us. The Missing
Persons and Unidentified Remains Act
is a prime example of that. Border
communities have borne the brunt of
the humanitarian and security crisis at
the border, and they are often forced to
do the job of the Federal Government
without any help from the Federal
Government.
This bill would go a long way helping
to defray some of those costs. It would
provide additional resources to local
communities working to identify those
who have gone missing as well as proc-
ess unidentified remains and invest in
the forensic equipment needed to pro-
vide closure to families in the United
States and abroad.
I appreciate the feedback of the folks
who live and work in our border com-
munities, and I look forward to head-
ing to the Rio Grande Valley tomorrow
with the Vice President and a number
of my colleagues on the Judiciary
Committee to hear more about the
challenges they are facing.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, as I begin my remarks, I would
like to thank the Senator from Texas
for the work he has done on arranging
our travel to the border tomorrow. I
am one of those committee members
who will make that trip.
How wonderful it is that he is work-
ing with Chairman GRAHAM to make
certain that we are going to be able to
visit with the Border Patrol to see and
hear firsthand what is going on, mak-
ing certain that we all focus on the se-
curity of this great Nation and provide
the resources that are needed. I thank
him for that good work.
ONLINE PREDATORS
Madam President, I want to talk
about another issue that is related to
what is happening when it comes to
trafficking. This has to do with our
children.
In 2017, ICE agents arrested Fran-
cisco Javier Soledad on charges of pro-
ducing child pornography using the
popular social media app Snapchat. He
assumed a variety of false identities—
first a teenage boy, later an adult
woman—and coerced at least six under-
age children into sending him sexually
explicit pictures and videos. When one
victim realized this was wrong and at-
tempted to block Soledad’s account,
Soledad turned around and threatened
this child—threatened him—with post-
ing this video on social media unless—
guess what—he sent more videos. He
did that on Snapchat.
Imagine this happening to a fright-
ened child. Imagine this happening to a
child who is close to you. Unfortu-
nately, it is not an isolated incident.
Matthew Murphy, of Massachusetts,
was recently charged with the sexual
exploitation of children after he posed
as a teenage girl in order to extort
nude photos from a middle school-aged
boy. Again, it was via Snapchat. Fed-
eral investigators found evidence that
Murphy used his fake account to vic-
timize other children in the area.
Before I continue, let’s talk about ex-
actly what is happening here, which is
horrific. Pedophiles are using popular
social media apps to trick underage
children into creating and distributing
homemade pornography. If we are
going to talk about these things, we
have to be focused and direct on what
is happening here and on the distribu-
tion methods that are being used.
By its very nature, Snapchat is a
child predator’s dream. Its auto-delete
feature allows individuals to ensure
their pictures and videos will erase
themselves after only a few seconds. Its
public location-sharing feature allows
anyone, even underage children, to
share their locations in real time. If
left in public mode, the Snap Map will
reveal their locations and their Snap
video feed to complete strangers. Even
if underage users haven’t fallen prey,
they are still exposed to provocative
and age-inappropriate material via the
app’s Discover feature—recommenda-
tions generated by Snapchat itself that
are free from parental control or moni-
toring.
If you have guessed that some of
these channels specialize in porn and
suggestive content, you would be right.
It is not small business. The 2018 rev-
enue for Snapchat was $1.18 billion.
How many teen users has it attracted?
There have been 16.4 million children
exposed to what I have just laid out.
That is why, this week, I sent a letter
to Snap executives and asked how they
plan to fight this predatory behavior
and if they will give parents more con-
trol over the content to which their
children are being exposed. To their
credit, Snap executives have already
reached out and responded, and it is
my hope that they will take these
questions seriously and do something
about this—do something about their
ratings, do something about the Dis-
cover section, do something about how
it leads children to these pornographic
sites.
As we talk about social media, I
think it is also important to note that
Snapchat is not the only offender.
Last month, I and my friend and col-
league Senator BLUMENTHAL sent a let-
ter to YouTube and asked why the

video service’s recommendation mech-
anism continues to push content that
involves children being in suggestive or
exploitative situations. By ‘‘suggestive
or exploitative,’’ I mean content that
features partially clothed children—
children in bathing suits and children
dressing and undressing themselves.
YouTube’s recommendation system
works by promoting similar videos to
the one the user is already watching,
which means that, by design, one vile
video can lead to another and another
and another until the user is buried in
smut that shouldn’t even exist. The
comments on these videos have turned
into a predator’s chat room that allows
users to share time stamps that mark
the most explicit moments in a video.
YouTube did disable comments in
videos that involve children, but its al-
gorithms continue to push this content
via the recommendation feature.
YouTube needs to stop this. It needs to
fix this.
The point of describing these things
is not to throw individual companies
and their technologies under the bus,
but it is crucial that we understand
that even at home or at school, our
children are very vulnerable and ex-
posed. Even benign technology that
doesn’t necessarily expose children to
pornography can pose a risk.
In 2015, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation filed a complaint with the
Federal Trade Commission against
Google. It alleged that the tech giant’s
Google for Education program was ex-
ploiting minors’ personal information
and potentially exposing it to third
parties. Think about that. It was ex-
posing their information to third par-
ties.
The Chromebooks that were issued to
students were loaded with Google
Sync, which allowed for the collection
and storage of students’ browsing his-
tory, information, and passwords. Pro-
gram administrators were given com-
plete access to a cloud system, which
allowed them to alter settings. This ex-
posed students’ data—educational data
and personal data—including physical
location data. This was exposed to
Google’s development team and to
third-party websites. One wrong click
would expose students’ ‘‘virtual you’’—
their presence, all of their informa-
tion—online.
In Tuesday’s Judiciary Committee
hearing, I asked the founder and CEO
of Protect Young Eyes, Christopher
McKenna, what steps he would take,
what he would recommend, to protect
our children from online predators. His
answer was really simple: Give parents
the option to control content access,
and don’t hide the tools that are nec-
essary to do this. Give them to the par-
ents. Make certain that they have
them.
Now, I am not suggesting a takeover
or a ban of these social media apps, and
I am not suggesting we drop a regu-
latory anvil on these companies. What
I am suggesting is that we should not
have to ask the makers of popular dig-
ital services to stop catering to child
predators. They should choose to rec-
ognize that predators lurk in every cor-
ner of society, and they should change
the age ratings on these apps. They
should issue the warnings to parents.
They should choose to make parents
aware of what a simple click or a tap
on a screen might unlock right before
their children’s eyes. They should
choose to stop this horrific cycle of de-
humanization and exploitation before
it begins. They should choose to work
with us to make certain that con-
sumers have all of the information
they need.
I yield the floor.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President,
on Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals heard oral arguments in the
Texas v. United States case to overturn
the Affordable Care Act. Unfortu-
nately, although the Affordable Care
Act is currently the law of the land,
the Department of Justice—our Na-
tion’s highest law enforcement author-
ity—was not there to defend the law of
the land, the Affordable Care Act. The
DOJ was not there because it had been
instructed by this President and this
administration to join the effort to
overturn the Affordable Care Act.
Sadly, the stakes of the Texas v.
United States litigation are profound.
This year in New Hampshire alone, ap-
proximately 90,000 Granite Staters ob-
tained health insurance coverage
through the Affordable Care Act’s Med-
icaid expansion or through the ACA’s
health insurance marketplaces. Across
the country, more than 17 million Med-
icaid expansion enrollees and 11 mil-
lion people in the marketplaces’ health
plans depend on the Affordable Care
Act for their coverage. Yet the Depart-
ment of Justice refuses to defend them.
It refuses to defend the law of the land
in court.
In this case, if the courts side with
the Trump administration and the Re-
publican attorneys general, millions of
these people will return to the days
when they were one cancer diagnosis,
one medical complication, or one car
accident away from medical bank-
ruptcy.
The Affordable Care Act’s coverage
expansion is also our most powerful
tool in combating the opioid epidemic.
This is critically important in New
Hampshire as we have the third highest
overdose death rate from opioids of any
State in the country. In New Hamp-
shire, more than 11,000 people receive
substance use disorder treatment
thanks to the Affordable Care Act’s
Medicaid expansion, and many more
Granite Staters are able to get sub-
stance use disorder treatment thanks
to coverage obtained through the
ACA’s health insurance marketplaces.
Just think. Without the expansion of
Medicaid, which is a bipartisan effort
in New Hampshire, and without the
ACA’s health insurance marketplaces,
we would have thousands of people af-
fected by substance use disorders who
would not be able to get treatment.
There is no plan B if the Affordable
Care Act is overturned.
In 2017, a mother named Nansie, from
Concord, wrote to my office. I will not
use her last name.
I ask unanimous consent to have
printed in the RECORD Nansie’s 2017 let-
ter.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
DEAR SENATOR SHAHEEN: Thank you for
giving me the opportunity to share my story
about ACA. It saved my son’s life.
Benjamin went to Keene State College
with the same hopes and dreams many have
when building their American dream. While
there he tried heroin. Addiction overcame
him but did not stop him from graduating.
After graduation he suffered a long road of
near death existence. After a couple of epi-
sodes where he had to be revived (fentanyl)
he chose recovery. It was due to Obamacare
that we were able to get him insured so that
he could get the proper help he needed and a
suboxone program that assisted him with
staying ‘‘clean’’. In April it will be a year for
Ben in his recovery. Without Obamacare this
would not have been possible. In early 2016
we had very long waiting lists for rehab and
then the ones with the means to pay were
the first accepted.
I can’t find the words to define my grati-
tude to President Obama. I believe my son
would not be alive today if it were not for
this plan that provided the means he needed
to get the help he needed at the time he
needed it. Ben still has a long road ahead of
him but I will see to it that he never walks
it alone.
It is one of my greatest wishes that one
day I could shake President Obama’s hand
and thank him for providing the tools that
saved my son’s life.
Sincerely,
NANSIE J. GARNHAM FEENY.
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, in
Nansie’s letter, she writes:
The ACA saved my son’s life. It was due to
ObamaCare that we were able to get him in-
sured so that he could get the proper help he
needed and get into a Suboxone program
that assisted him. Now, if the courts side
with the Trump administration, this critical
source for treatment and recovery could be
ripped away.
We don’t have enough time for me to
go through the whole list of all of the
benefits under the Affordable Care Act
that will be lost if the ACA gets over-
turned. One of the benefits, though,
that would be thrown out yet is criti-
cally important to the people of New
Hampshire and across this country is
that of the consumer protections
against skyrocketing prescription drug
costs. They will be gone.
A couple of weeks ago, I was at a
hearing in the Committee on Aging,
and we had someone from the FDA who
was testifying. She talked about the
fact that the major driver in prescrip-
tion drug costs under Medicare and
Medicaid was the cost of biologic drugs
and that what was bringing down that
cost was the pathway for biosimilars to
create alternatives of those biologic
drugs for those people. What she failed
to point out was that this provision

was in the Affordable Care Act and
that if the Affordable Care Act gets
struck down, this provision will get
struck down. Those increased costs
that we have been seeing of those bio-
logic drugs are going to continue going
up.
What is probably even more impor-
tant for most people in New Hampshire
is that the Affordable Care Act in-
cludes a very important program that
has closed the Medicare Part D cov-
erage gap—what is called the doughnut
hole—for prescription drug coverage.
This program has saved New Hamp-
shire’s seniors an average of $1,100 a
year in Medicare prescription drug
costs. These savings help to ensure
that Granite Staters who have fixed in-
comes can pay their utility bills or put
food on the table.
The court’s decision could wipe out
these critical Medicare savings for sen-
iors, just as it could wipe out coverage
for preexisting conditions, coverage to
keep young people on their parents’ in-
surance up until they are the age of 26,
and coverage for essential health bene-
fits, which means that mental health
care and coverage for substance use
disorder treatment are required by in-
surance companies to be covered.
So given what is at stake, at this
point I want to offer a unanimous con-
sent request that the Senate proceed to
the consideration of S. Res. 134, which
is a resolution I introduced to express
a sense of the Senate that the Depart-
ment of Justice should reverse its posi-
tion in the Texas v. United States case
and defend the Affordable Care Act.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 134
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that as in legislative session, the
Judiciary Committee be discharged
from further consideration of S. Res.
134 and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, that the
resolution be agreed to, the preamble
be agreed to, and the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
YOUNG). Is there objection?
The Senator from Wyoming.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, whether
you support the ObamaCare law or op-
pose it—and let me be clear, I oppose
it—it remains the law.
This week, a Federal appellate court
heard arguments related to the case of
Texas v. United States, and I expect it
will eventually end up before the U.S.
Supreme Court.
Regardless of the outcome, our com-
mitment remains to protect people
with preexisting conditions. As a doc-
tor, as a husband of a breast cancer
survivor, I know the importance of
making sure patients can have access
to high-quality healthcare at an afford-
able cost.
Since the Obama healthcare law
passed, this has not happened for many
families to whom I speak at home in
Wyoming. They keep telling me that
ObamaCare made their insurance
unaffordable, and it has made it more
difficult for them to get the care they
need. Simply put, they know that the
Obama healthcare law has failed be-
cause they have personally experienced
the law’s sky-high premiums and fewer
choices.
It has taken Washington Democrats
a little longer to figure that out. Now
they are clamoring for a one-size-fits-
all healthcare plan. They want a
healthcare system controlled by Wash-
ington bureaucrats, and as a doctor,
my focus is on making healthcare bet-
ter for patients, period.
Republicans in the Trump adminis-
tration are taking on the tough issues
facing patients across the country. We
eliminated the individual mandate so
that patients aren’t punished for refus-
ing to buy insurance they cannot af-
ford. We support more insurance
choices, such as association health
plans, so folks can find the best cov-
erage for themselves and their fami-
lies. We are taking on the drug compa-
nies. Congress has already eliminated
gag clauses, and more reforms are on
the way. Finally, with the President’s
support, we are going to end surprise
medical bills. Simply put, Republicans
want patients to pay less for the cov-
erage they already have.
Democrats want to take away peo-
ple’s health insurance, especially the
coverage they get through their work.
It is simply wrong. The question is
whether Washington Democrats are in-
terested in actually solving the prob-
lem or playing politics.
Therefore, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from New Hampshire.
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I
knew my colleague from Wyoming was
going to object. I am disappointed in
his objection, and I know he is a doc-
tor. I believe he cares about his former
patients. I believe he cares about pro-
viding healthcare to his constituents,
as I believe all of my colleagues care
about that.
That is why I am so puzzled by why
there has been a 9-year effort to try
and undermine the Affordable Care Act
and the healthcare that it provides to
people in this country.
As I said earlier, there is no followup
plan that will provide coverage for peo-
ple with preexisting conditions if the
Affordable Care Act is overturned.
There is no followup plan that will pro-
vide coverage for people with substance
abuse disorders, for mental health cov-
erage. That is all going to go out the
window.
By failing to send a clear message to
the Justice Department that they
should defend the Affordable Care Act,
we are putting access to care at risk
for millions of Americans across this
country.
What we should be doing—and we
should have done it as soon as the ef-
fort to overturn the Affordable Care
Act was defeated in 2017—is working
together to put in place changes that
make the Affordable Care Act work
better. We should be looking for ways
to provide coverage to people that is
affordable, that provides quality
healthcare, that is accessible to every
American. Instead of that, we have no
plan B. There is no bill that would pro-
vide coverage if this administration is
successful in overturning the Afford-
able Care Act.
I am very disappointed, though not
surprised, by the reaction from my col-
league from Wyoming.
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF PETER C. WRIGHT
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise in
opposition today to the nomination of
Peter Wright to serve as the Assistant
Administrator for EPA’s Office of Land
and Emergency Management.
I take little joy in opposing the nom-
ination but do so for three reasons. Be-
fore I say those three reasons—I stood
on this floor right up until the end of
the last Congress, trying to get Peter
Wright confirmed with a unanimous
consent approach, and we failed at the
very end.
The irony of it is, having stood here
and tried to get him confirmed at the
end of the last Congress and today
being in a position in which I am ask-
ing for us to postpone, at least for
today, his nomination—there is an
irony there, and I don’t have the time
to go into all of the reasons, but I will
mention a few of them.
In the last Congress, I worked with
the EPA to negotiate a set of signifi-
cant policy concessions that I believe
would have allowed the Senate minor-
ity to agree to a more expeditious con-
firmation process for Mr. Wright.
I worked diligently until the closing
of the last Congress—right until the
bitter end, if you will—to achieve that
objective, as I have done in good faith
for other EPA nominees.
In fact, the very last nominee con-
firmed in the last Congress was an EPA
nominee to head the Agency’s Tribal
Office, Chad McIntosh. My staff and I
and others were very much involved in
getting him confirmed.
In this Congress, EPA has refused to
reengage with my office, with our com-
mittee staff, or with me on this nomi-
nation. The Agency no longer agrees to
the policy concessions that I pre-
viously secured and to which they had
previously committed in the last Con-
gress. While this has been a real dis-
appointment for me, unfortunately, it
is hardly a surprise, given the increas-
ingly extreme policy and tone of this
EPA.
Second, EPA, under Mr. Wright’s
leadership for the past year, has failed
to advance an area of policy that is
critical to me and to many other Sen-
ators, and that is the regulation of
PFAS chemicals known as permanent
chemicals. Per- and polyfluorinated
alkyl substances, known as PFAS, are
a class of manmade chemicals that in-
cludes something called PFOA, PFOS,

GenX, and many other chemicals. De-
veloped in the 1940s, PFAS can be
found across industries in many prod-
ucts, including food packaging,
nonstick pans, clothing, furniture, and
firefighting foam used by the military.
Just this week, Donald Trump said:
‘‘We have the cleanest water we have
ever had.’’ The President has often
made this statement while asserting
his commitment to ensure that our
drinking water is safe.
In his confirmation hearing, EPA Ad-
ministrator Andrew Wheeler said:
It is these Americans that President
Trump and his Administration are focused
on, Americans without access to safe drink-
ing water or Americans living on or near
hazardous sites, often unaware of the health
risks that they and their families face. Many
of these sites have languished for years, even
decades. How can these Americans prosper if
they cannot live, learn, or work in healthy
environments? The answer is simple. They
cannot. President Trump understands this
and that is why he is focused on putting
Americans first.
That is from Andrew Wheeler, now
our EPA Administrator.
Yet under Peter Wright’s leadership
for the past year, EPA’s Office of Land
and Management has failed to heed
these words. Peter Wright serves on a
temporary basis without confirmation.
I think we have a poster here that is
relevant.
A study released today by the Envi-
ronmental Working Group identified
712 locations in 49 States that are con-
taminated with PFAS—712 locations in
49 States that are contaminated with
PFAS—from coast to coast, from our
Canadian border to the Gulf Stream
waters.
Just last year, the town of Blades in
the southern part of Delaware alerted
its 1,250 residents to stop using public
water for drinking and cooking because
of PFAS contamination at nearly twice
the Federal health advisory level.
Just an hour from Blades, up north
on Route 13, officials at the Dover Air
Force Base found that 36 of the 37 sam-
pled ground water wells showed dan-
gerously high levels of PFOS and
PFOA, related to, we believe, the use of
chemicals in firefighting foam at the
base.
It is not just Delaware. PFAS con-
tamination is widespread, in red
States, in blue States, in small water
systems and large ones, on military
sites and in residential areas, from
Maine to Alaska.
While industrial manufacturers and
users of these chemicals are respon-
sible for much of the contamination, it
turns out that a principal user of PFAS
was our military.
I speak as a retired Navy Captain
speaking here to a Presiding Officer
who is a marine, and for us it is per-
sonal and part of our history in the
military.
But it turns out that a principal user
of PFAS was the military, which used
it as a firefighting foam, as I said ear-
lier.
In 1973, I was a young naval flight of-
ficer stationed at Moffett Field naval
air station in California, and on a
sunny April day, as I was driving into
work from my home in Palo Alto, I saw
a big, black plume of smoke rising
above my base after, as it turned out, a
massive NASA Convair jet descended
on runway. We had parallel runways,
and air traffic control had directed two
aircraft to land on the same runway at
the same time. As a result, the large
NASA Convair jet descended on a run-
way where a P–3 aircraft—my sister
squadron’s aircraft—had already land-
ed and was taxiing, and the larger air-
craft literally landed on top of the
smaller aircraft.
It took over an hour for firefighters
to control the blaze. Sixteen people
died, and only one crewman on the P–
3 survived. These were my brothers and
sisters. These were my sister squadron
mates.
I understand that PFAS-containing
foam has supported our military readi-
ness and saved lives better than most,
but the cruel irony is that when PFAS
winds up in a glass on the kitchen
table, these same chemicals endanger
lives.
The Environmental Working Group—
that is the name of a group—has iden-
tified 117 military sites, including 77
airfields, with PFAS contamination be-
cause of the use of PFAS-containing
foam to both train for and fight fires
involving highly flammable jet fuels.
Yet in many States, cleanup of these
sites has been stalled, and the military
has shockingly been part of the prob-
lem.
In May of last year, 2018, then-EPA
Administrator Scott Pruitt held a
PFAS National Leadership Summit
and proudly announced four ‘‘concrete
steps’’ that EPA would take to address
PFAS contamination. The second of
these four steps was that EPA would
propose designating PFOA and PFOS—
two of the most dangerous, troubling
elements in this class of chemicals—as
hazardous substances under the Super-
fund law. That was more than a year
ago.
Making that designation would com-
pel the Defense Department to stop
fighting cleanups in States all across
the country. Indeed, in some cases, the
Defense Department has justified its
refusal to clean up PFAS contamina-
tion on grounds that the Superfund
designation has not yet been made.
Designating these substances as haz-
ardous would also unleash EPA re-
sources to address cleanups of orphan
sites where there is no identified liable
polluter.
Despite Scott Pruitt’s commitment
to move forward with the designation
of PFAS as a hazardous substance
under the Superfund law, under Peter
Wright’s watch, EPA hasn’t even pro-
posed—has not even proposed—to do
that, let alone finalize the action. At
this rate, it will be at least another
year, maybe longer, before this vital
step will be taken. Americans deserve
better than this, and they deserve
greater urgency on this issue.
Last month, the U.S. Senate, right
here, passed its National Defense Au-
thorization Act, which included several
important bipartisan provisions to ad-
dress PFAS contamination. Notably, I
could not even secure an agreement to
allow a vote on my amendment that
would designate PFAS as hazardous
substances under the Superfund law. I
did not get a vote on my amendment,
despite the fact that 35 Democratic and
Republican cosponsors on bipartisan
legislation clearly signaled their sup-
port for this policy. Meanwhile, EPA
continues to drag its heels, acting with
far more urgency to repeal environ-
mental regulations than to clean up
the water our government’s own activi-
ties have inadvertently contaminated.
Mr. Wright will have the ability to
make this hazardous substances des-
ignation for PFAS if he is confirmed.
Let me say that again. Mr. Wright will
have the ability to make this haz-
ardous substance designation for PFAS
if he is confirmed. He should hear
strongly from this Senate our collec-
tive desire that he urgently do so.
It was my hope that, despite the
many disagreements my colleagues and
I have had with the Trump EPA on
their views on climate change and
some environmental rollbacks, there
could at least be some commonsense
agreement on the need to clean up
widespread PFAS contamination. That
has not been the case, at least thus far.
Third, and finally, a late-breaking
matter came to the committee’s atten-
tion this week regarding an ethics in-
vestigation into Mr. Wright’s financial
disclosures. Chairman BARRASSO and I
received news from the White House
Office of Government Ethics, known as
OGE, that Mr. Wright, despite numer-
ous written assurances to the contrary,
held stock in DowDuPont at the time
he filed his nominee financial disclo-
sure report and continued to do so
until this March 12, a couple of months
ago. Although EPA believes that Mr.
Wright has complied with all applica-
ble ethics laws during that period of
time, OGE, the Office of Government
Ethics, asserts that it currently lacks
the information necessary to make
such a determination or to send a com-
pleted amendment to his ethics agree-
ment and financial disclosure report to
our committee.
OGE, Office of Government Ethics,
felt compelled to share this informa-
tion with the EPW Committee because
of its direct relevance to the Senate’s
consideration of Mr. Wright’s nomina-
tion today.
In light of the ongoing OGE inves-
tigation, I would implore my col-
leagues to delay the Senate’s consider-
ation of Mr. Wright’s nomination for
the time being. I don’t suggest delay-
ing consideration of this nominee
lightly. Again, I was one of the key
people standing in this Chamber back
at the end of December trying to get
this man confirmed. In fact, any delay
in the Senate’s confirmation and the
Senate’s consideration of Mr. Wright’s

nomination would not prevent him
from continuing to serve in his current
capacity, as he has done since he first
arrived at EPA in an acting capacity
on July 9, 2018.
I strongly believe we must afford
OGE—Office of Government Ethics—
and EPA the opportunity to complete
their investigations into this matter
and fully share all relevant informa-
tion, for both the sake of Mr. Wright
and for the Agency. If the facts are as
described by EPA, then a completed in-
vestigation would be to Mr. Wright’s
benefit. Let me say that again. If the
facts are as described by EPA, then a
completed investigation would be to
Mr. Wright’s benefit.
Let me close by saying, if, however,
OGE and EPA reach a different conclu-
sion, such information would be di-
rectly relevant to every Senator’s de-
liberation when voting whether to con-
firm Peter Wright to the position of
Assistant Administrator in the Office
of Land and Emergency Management
at EPA.
From conversations I had with EPA
yesterday, it is my understanding that
EPA is working to get the relevant in-
formation to OGE to provide to the
Senate. Proceeding with the consider-
ation of this nomination while resolu-
tion of this ethics matter between EPA
and OGE is pending I think deprives
the Senate of important and relevant
information. I have urged delaying this
vote today. I would do so again. In the
absence of that delay, along with the
other reasons I mentioned, I will vote
no on the motion to proceed to the
nomination of Peter Wright. I urge my
colleagues to do the same.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico.
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, let me, at
the beginning, thank Senator CARPER
for his incredible leadership on the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee. He has a very good bill on
cleaning up PFAS. I have signed on to
it, and I am going to talk about some
of the damage in New Mexico. As Sen-
ator CARPER knows, this is a nation-
wide problem that the Department of
Defense has major responsibility for.
This is a photograph of Art Schaap at
his dairy farm in New Mexico, where he
owns 4,000 head of cattle. Art’s farm is
located outside of Clovis, in the central
part of the State, adjacent to Cannon
Air Force Base.
Art is a second-generation dairy
farmer. He and his family worked hard
to build this dairy, keep his cows
healthy, and provide nutritious milk to
New Mexico and the Nation’s con-
sumers, but today Art will dump 15,000
gallons of milk. That is enough milk to
give 240,000 children a carton of milk
with their school lunch. He will dump
another 15,000 gallons tomorrow and
the next day and the next day.
Why is Art dumping all of this milk?
Because highly toxic contaminants
from Cannon Air Force Base have pol-
luted the groundwater he uses to water
his cows. The groundwater Art uses for
his cows and for his family’s drinking
water is polluted by a group of toxic
chemicals collectively known as PFAS.
We know PFAS are dangerous to hu-
mans. They are associated with in-
creased risk of liver, testicular, kid-
ney, and pancreatic cancer. They are
linked to altered puberty, endocrine
disruption, pregnancy disorders, and
lowered fertility.
Art’s dairy is ruined. He can’t sell his
milk. He can’t sell his cows. He can’t
sell his property. He is spending thou-
sands of dollars to maintain his cows
and dump milk. In fact, the PFAS lev-
els in Art’s groundwater are 371 times
greater than what the Environmental
Protection Agency says is safe.
The Air Force knows it is responsible
for this environmental disaster, but it
claims it doesn’t have the legal author-
ity to provide clean water for Art’s
cows or to reimburse Art for his lost
livelihood.
Art is not alone. There are other New
Mexico dairies located near Cannon Air
Force Base that are threatened. Those
dairies have spent hundreds of thou-
sands of their own dollars to install
water filters to prevent them from los-
ing their livelihoods.
The Department of Defense has iden-
tified over 400 military sites where
PFAS were used. There are over 100
military sites nationwide with known
PFAS contamination. This is a na-
tional problem of immense proportion.
Yet this President’s EPA refuses to
issue drinking water standards for
PFAS. It has issued only an advisory
that does not have the force of law.
This President’s EPA has failed to even
list these chemicals as hazardous sub-
stances eligible for Superfund cleanup.
Our farmers and rural America deserve
better—much better.
Although the Air Force claimed it
had no authority to provide relief, the
then-head of the Air Force, Secretary
Heather Wilson, assured me in a hear-
ing, under oath, the Air Force would
work with me on legislation to secure
that authority for the Air Force. Con-
trary to that assurance, the Air Force
did not work with us on that legisla-
tion. They made it clear they don’t
even want the authority to help farm-
ers like Art. So, in March, I introduced
the PFAS Damages Act—along with
Senator HEINRICH and Representatives
LUJÁN, TORRES SMALL, and HAALAND—
to ensure compensation for those hurt
and to make sure those contaminated
sites were cleaned up.
I also joined Senator CARPER’s bipar-
tisan PFAS Action Act of 2019 that re-
quires EPA to establish PFAS as haz-
ardous substances eligible for Super-
fund cleanup funds.
Clean water is not and should not be
a partisan issue. New Mexico is a patri-
otic State and honors its military
bases, but the Department of Defense
caused this contamination and needs to
make it right.
Senator HEINRICH was able to include
our bill as an amendment to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act that
the Senate passed by an overwhelming
margin of 86 to 8 in June. It looked like
relief—relief owed to Art and others
unfairly hurt—would be on the way,
but 2 days ago, on Tuesday, the Presi-
dent threatened to veto the entire De-
fense bill if it gets to his desk with pro-
visions to help farmers like Art and to
clean up PFAS contamination.
That is a $750 billion bill for national
security and defense he is threatening
to veto because it requires cleanup of a
known pollutant. Without a doubt, this
is one of the most outrageous veto
threats I have ever witnessed in 30
years in Congress—vetoing the Defense
bill over help for farmers facing ruin?
It is shameful. Republican leadership
in the Senate and the House should
join us and make it clear to the Presi-
dent that this is one veto that will be
overridden.
On top of all of this, the President is
asking the Senate to confirm Peter
Wright, a top lawyer from Dow Chem-
ical—one of the largest chemical com-
panies in the world and the one that
manufactured PFAS—to run the EPA
toxic cleanup office. This nomination
is more filling the swamp by this ad-
ministration, more foxes guarding the
henhouse.
EPA has slow-walked designating
PFAS as hazardous substances under
the Superfund Program Mr. Wright
wants to oversee. Mr. Wright has
recused himself from matters relating
to Dow Chemical and therefore will
provide no leadership on this pressing
issue.
The American people deserve a nomi-
nee who will clean up current PFAS
contamination and prevent future con-
tamination. Mr. Wright can give no
such assurance, and I will be voting no
on his nomination.
I call upon the President to nominate
someone who will commit to tackling
this issue with the urgency it deserves
and to withdraw his shocking veto
threat so innocent farmers like Art can
save their families’ livelihoods.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I
rise to oppose the nomination of Peter
Wright as Assistant Administrator for
the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’s Office of Land and Emergency
Management.
This position is of enormous con-
sequence to the people of New Jersey,
and I refuse to stay silent as the
Trump administration stacks Federal
agencies charged with protecting our
health and our environmental safety
with industry insiders and corporate
hacks.
Mr. Wright is a former chemical in-
dustry lawyer. If confirmed, he will be
charged with overseeing the cleanup of
the most toxic waste sites in America
through what is known as the Super-
fund Program.
New Jersey is home to more Super-
fund sites than any other State in the
Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4793
July 11, 2019
For many years, a lack of strong en-
vironmental protections and oversight
left our communities vulnerable to un-
safe, unchecked, unregulated pollution.
I am talking about the days before we
had an Environmental Protection
Agency, before we passed landmark en-
vironmental laws, and before we had
regulations to protect public health.
Back then, big polluters had a blank
check to contaminate our air, soil, and
water with toxic chemicals. People
across America were exposed to pes-
ticides, lead, asbestos, and other toxins
through the air they breathed, the riv-
ers they fished, the soil they farmed,
and the land they built. It was
unhealthy, it was unsustainable, and in
many cases, it was downright dan-
gerous.
Indeed, it was 1980—the same year a
chemical waste facility in Elizabeth,
NJ, burst into flames and forced an en-
tire community to stay indoors—that
Congress passed a law creating the
Superfund Program. Today, Superfund
is our primary tool for cleaning up the
hazardous waste across America. It re-
quires polluters to pay to clean up the
sites they have contaminated, and it
also funds the cleanup of orphan sites
for which the polluters responsible no
longer exist.
The Superfund Program is a promise
to our communities—a promise to hold
polluters accountable for the damage
they have done; a promise to rid our
soil and water of toxic chemicals; a
promise to transform toxic brownfields
into safe, livable, usable land; and a
promise to protect the health of to-
day’s families and of future genera-
tions.
That promise cannot be kept on its
own. We the people must keep that
promise. The one way we can do so is
by ensuring that leaders who oversee
the Superfund Program are willing to
stand up to polluters, listen to the best
science, and hold big corporations ac-
countable. Nothing in Peter Wright’s
records suggest he will be that kind of
leader. He spent nearly two decades as
a lawyer for Dow Chemical—one of the
primary polluters for many Superfund
sites across the Nation.
For all the President’s talk of drain-
ing the swamp, it is just that—talk.
Mr. Wright could have been a force
for good at Dow. He could have stood
up for science and raised standards. He
could have pushed for more efficient,
thorough cleanups of toxic waste. In-
stead, he did just the opposite.
Consider Dow’s Midland site in
Michigan, where more than a century
of producing things like Styrofoam,
Agent Orange, and mustard gas left
rivers contaminated for more than 50
miles. As Dow’s self-styled ‘‘Dioxin
Lawyer,’’ Mr. Wright points to the
Midland site as one of his greatest
achievements. But a New York Times
investigation from last year tells us a
different story. It found that under Mr.
Wright’s watch, Dow was accused of
‘‘submitting disputed data, misrepre-
senting scientific evidence and delay-
ing cleanup.’’
These accusations were leveled by
Federal regulators and whistleblowers
alike. One independent lab found Dow
used incomplete contamination data,
leaving the risk of toxins going unde-
tected. An internal whistleblower re-
vealed Dow intentionally designed its
data so that it couldn’t be properly
vetted by independent third parties.
In 2007, an EPA memo concluded that
Dow had ‘‘documented history of im-
peding the efforts of the Michigan De-
partment of Environmental Quality’’
at the Midland site. It wasn’t only reg-
ulators that Mr. Wright misled; the
EPA also found that Dow ‘‘frequently
provided information to the public that
contradicts agency positions and gen-
erally accepted scientific informa-
tion.’’ That included mailing out a
newsletter to local residents
downplaying the risks of dioxin to
human health, which, according to the
EPA, is highly toxic, can cause cancer,
reproductive and developmental prob-
lems, and damage the immune system.
The newsletter even included the false
claim that dioxin-contaminated wild
game was safe to eat. That is appalling.
Mr. Wright also participated in Dow’s
funding of a study claiming that people
living on dioxin-contaminated soil
were not at risk for personal exposure.
Simply put, Peter Wright made his
mark at Dow Chemical by misrepre-
senting science, downplaying threats
to public health, and undermining
cleanups. These practices run counter
to the very mission of the EPA. Yet
Wright’s past indicates that, if con-
firmed, he will continue to mislead
communities, continue to delay clean-
ups, and continue to sacrifice the
health of our people for the bottom line
of corporate polluters.
Finally, as if it weren’t enough to
mislead the public, we now know that
Mr. Wright misled Congress when he
lied to the Environment and Public
Works Committee about continuing to
own stock in Dow after his nomination.
When I hear that Mr. Wright proudly
called himself the ‘‘Dioxin Lawyer,’’
when I hear that he misled families
about threats to their health, and when
I hear that he sought to distort sci-
entific evidence and get his company
off the hook for their toxic legacy, I
worry about the damage he could do
across the Nation, including in New
Jersey.
New Jersey is home to 114 Superfund
sites. That is more than California—a
State with 41⁄2 times our population.
That is more than double the total
sites in Texas—a State with 30 times
our land mass. Millions of people live
within a few miles of these sites, in
North Jersey and South Jersey, in bus-
tling cities and rural towns, in every
corner of our State. Among them is one
of the largest Superfund cleanups in
the country. Like the site in Michigan,
New Jersey’s Diamond Alkali Super-
fund site is contaminated with dioxin
from the making of Agent Orange. Like
the site in Michigan, we have warnings
about dioxin-contaminated food, such
as seafood from the Passaic River.
Like those in Michigan, the New
Jerseyans who reside by the Passaic
are depending on the Superfund Pro-
gram to clean up the river and limit
their exposure to toxic chemicals.
These families and millions of Ameri-
cans nationwide are depending on the
EPA to protect the water they drink,
the air they breathe, and the soil on
which they farm and build. They are
depending on their government to put
their health ahead of corporate pol-
luter profits. Today they are depending
on us to reject the nomination of Peter
Wright.
The EPA has a simple mission: to
protect human health and the environ-
ment. The American people deserve an
Assistant Administrator who believes
in that mission, not someone who has
spent decades fighting it. I urge my
colleagues to vote no on Mr. Wright’s
nomination.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts.
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask to
be recognized for 7 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise
in opposition to the nomination of
Peter Wright for the position of Assist-
ant Administrator of the Office of Land
and Emergency Management at the En-
vironmental Protection Agency. If con-
firmed to this position, Mr. Wright
would be in charge of the office that
cleans up hazardous waste, contami-
nated lands, oilspills, and environ-
mental disasters. He would be at the
helm of the Nation’s Superfund Pro-
gram, which is critical to keeping our
communities and families safe from
dangerous chemicals and other toxic
substances.
As a former counsel for Dow Chem-
ical Company, Peter Wright’s résumé
looks eerily similar to the listing of
parties responsible for contaminated
Superfund sites across our country.
For 19 years at Dow, he was known as
the company’s dioxin lawyer. He head-
ed negotiations for a massive cleanup
of this cancerous chemical at a time
when the company was accused of de-
laying cleanup efforts and misrepre-
senting scientific evidence.
For the past year, Peter Wright
worked in an unconfirmed capacity as
‘‘special counsel to the EPA Adminis-
trator.’’ Despite promising to divest all
his equity interests in DowDupont, it
was recently revealed that he held on
to those stocks until just 4 months ago.
Continuing to profit off of a chemical
company while working for the pri-
mary Federal Agency responsible for
regulating that company is unaccept-
able behavior.
Just as our lands need protection
from toxic chemicals, our government
needs to be kept safe from ethical dan-
gers and toxic nominees—two things
that have continually contaminated
the Trump administration.

Anderson. Anne worked tirelessly to
expose the link between the industrial
chemical TCE and the development of
leukemia in Woburn, MA, and the chil-
dren of Woburn, MA. Her work and the
work of other Woburn families helped
spur Congress to pass the Superfund
law. I was a champion of that bill in
the House, and I am proud to continue
to defend and strengthen the Superfund
Program today in the Senate.
Anne Anderson’s son Jimmy died
from exposure to TCE and other chemi-
cals. She had to do the job because the
Federal Government was not doing the
job. She had to be the one to put to-
gether all the other mothers who had
children who were also going to die.
You may have seen the movie or read
the book ‘‘A Civil Action.’’ It is a very
good movie, but it is about her. It is
about what happens when the Federal
Government turns a blind eye to the
impact that large chemical companies
and others have upon the lives of ordi-
nary citizens if there aren’t proper pro-
tections.
Those sites are cleaned up. Her son
Jimmy has passed. The site now has a
transportation facility on it. It is
named the ‘‘Jimmy Anderson Trans-
portation Center,’’ in his name. He
died. Superfund is meant to make sure
there are no more Jimmy Andersons.
Right now, there are tens of millions
of acres of contaminated land in Amer-
ica and in places with long industrial
histories, like Massachusetts, and we
have nearly a century’s worth of toxic
materials that have accumulated
across our State and across the coun-
try. That is why we need an Assistant
Administrator who will fight to protect
American communities from these
toxic exposures and make sure pol-
luters pay for that cleanup.
Recently, Congress has been debating
how to handle a class of chemicals
known collectively as PFAS, which are
everything from Teflon to firefighting
foams and are often called forever
chemicals because of how long they
stay in the environment, cycling
through soil, water, and air, until they
build up in our food and in our bodies.
Certain PFAS chemicals are associated
with a host of dreaded diseases: cancer,
thyroid hormone disruption, low infant
birth rates, and immune system prob-
lems. PFAS should really be ‘‘poi-
sonous for all species’’ because it poi-
sons fish and it poisons cows. It poisons
the water. Ultimately, it begins to af-
fect human beings as well. PFAS—
‘‘poisonous for all species.’’
Massachusetts has documented PFAS
contamination in Ayer, Barnstable,
Mashpee, Shirley, Middleton—all
across our Commonwealth. Polluters
should pay to clean up their messes,
but right now, it is the public that
pays. This could change if the EPA
would follow up on a promise made by
Scott Pruitt to designate PFAS as a
hazardous substance under the Super-
fund law. More than a year later, we
are still waiting.
We need a champion at the head of
the Superfund office. There are many
Anne Andersons around this country
trying to keep their little Jimmys pro-
tected. Mr. Wright hasn’t committed to
giving our communities the weapons
they need to fight back against chem-
ical contamination. That is why today
I will oppose his nomination on this
floor.
Mr. President, with that, I yield
back.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to complete my re-
marks on this nominee before the vote.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President,
today the Senate is considering the
nomination of Peter Wright to serve as
the Assistant Administrator of the En-
vironmental Protection Agency for the
Office of Land and Emergency Manage-
ment. If confirmed, Mr. Wright will
lead this critical EPA office that pro-
vides policy, provides guidance, and
provides direction for the EPA’s emer-
gency response and waste programs.
Mr. Wright will play a crucial role in
helping the Agency respond to disas-
ters and cleanups.
The Office of Land and Emergency
Management oversees the Superfund
Program, which is a priority for this
administration.
There are currently about 1,300 listed
Superfund sites across America. On top
of those, there are roughly 450,000
brownfield sites that need to be ad-
dressed. The EPA needs an Assistant
Administrator in place to prioritize
those cleanups. Peter Wright is ready
for the task. He currently serves as a
special counsel at the EPA. Previously,
Mr. Wright worked as managing coun-
sel to Dow Chemical Company for near-
ly 20 years. His nomination has been
endorsed by 18 current and former
chairs of the American Bar Associa-
tion’s Section of Environment, Energy,
and Resources, including John Cruden,
former Assistant Attorney General in
President Obama’s administration.
John Milner, the current chair of the
section, writing on behalf of the former
chair, said this of Mr. Wright: ‘‘Peter’s
career, his selfless commitment to the
American Bar Association’s Section of
Environment, Energy, and Resources
and the members it serves, and his
well-recognized personal integrity ex-
emplify the high standards of the legal
profession.’’ He goes on to say: ‘‘We en-
thusiastically and without reservation
support the consideration of Peter as
Assistant Administrator for OLEM,
and believe Peter will serve the office
with distinction and honor.’’
He is ready to take on this responsi-
bility, and he has been ready for well
over a year. President Trump origi-
nally nominated Peter Wright to serve
in this important role on March 6, 2018.
That was 493 days ago. What is the rea-
son for so long of a delay? Obstruction
by Senate Democrats. We have seen it
before. For over a year, this important
EPA office has been without confirmed
leadership because of political games
being played by Senate Democrats.
Now the games have ended, and it is
time to get serious.
Senate Democrats are now saying
they would delay this vote further be-
cause of an error Mr. Wright included
on his disclosures. According to career
EPA ethics officials, Mr. Wright made
an inadvertent error and immediately
corrected it. EPA ethics officials found
that he did not violate any Federal
ethics laws or regulations.
Justina Fugh, who is a career ethics
official at the EPA, concluded in her
memo reviewing Mr. Wright’s action:
In my opinion, Mr. Wright adhered to the
federal ethics laws and regulations. When he
became aware of the inadvertent error, he
notified me immediately and corrected that
error.
The delays must end. Superfund sites
need to be cleaned up, emergencies
must be responded to, and this impor-
tant office needs its Senate-confirmed
leader in place. It is time to confirm
Peter Wright to be Assistant Adminis-
trator of the EPA for the Office of
Land and Emergency Management, and
I strongly encourage Senators to sup-
port this nomination.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise to
address one of the most pressing crises
the American people are facing today.
Our refusal to address the border crisis
is inexcusable.
Right now, Texas and other border
States are being overwhelmed by thou-
sands upon thousands of illegal immi-
grants who are flooding into small
communities monthly. The inaction of
the U.S. Congress leaves these commu-
nities responsible for paying for where
these illegal immigrants will stay, for
how they will receive medical care, and
for where they will go when they are
released.
From Brownsville to McAllen, to La-
redo to Eagle Pass, to Del Rio, to El
Paso, and beyond, Texas communities
are at their breaking point in terms of
resources and manpower in dealing
with this crisis. I am hearing from
elected officials throughout South
Texas—Democrats and Republicans—
that the crisis has reached a breaking
point.
Our hard-working Border Patrol
agents are also struggling with the
enormous influx of illegal immigrants.
It has been reported that there are now
more illegal immigrants in custody
than Border Patrol agents on the
southern border and thousands more
being apprehended daily.
Since last October, over half a mil-
lion illegal immigrants have been ap-
prehended at our southern border,
many of them having traveled through
Mexico from El Salvador, Honduras,
and Guatemala. Over 200,000 of these il-
legal immigrants were single adults,
and over 56,000 of them were unaccom-
panied children.
During this time, the Border Patrol
also apprehended nearly 700 gang mem-
bers trying to illegally enter the
United States. In the month of May
alone, the Border Patrol apprehended
over 144,000 people coming through the
southern border—144,000 in a single
month. If that pace were to continue
for a year, we would be looking at
nearly 2 million apprehensions in just 1
year. That is a staggering number of il-
legal immigrants for Texas and other
border States to take in.
Instead of acknowledging that this
crisis exists, instead of doing the re-
sponsible thing and taking action, con-
gressional Democrats instead have
stubbornly clung to open-border fan-
tasies. Speaker PELOSI has called the
hundreds of thousands of illegal immi-
grants coming through our border a
‘‘manufactured crisis.’’ Some of our
colleagues on the Presidential trail
have called it a ‘‘fake crisis’’ and
‘‘fearmongering of the worst kind’’ or
have said that climate change is a
more serious crisis. All I can tell them

is to go to the border. The crisis at the
border is very real, despite what the
Democratic talking points say.
Last week, I visited the Rio Grande
Valley, as I have done many times in
representing the State of Texas in the
Senate. I have toured the Rio Grande
Valley Centralized Processing Center,
the largest immigration processing
center in the United States. I also trav-
eled to Rincon Village, which is ground
zero for illegal border crossings near
Mission, TX. What I saw there was
staggering. When I was in the Rio
Grande Valley, the RGV Sector Chief
told me that in 2014, just 5 years ago,
roughly 2 percent of single adult men
crossing illegally into the Rio Grande
Valley had a child with them. Today
that number is roughly 50 percent. It
went from 2 percent all the way up to
50 percent. The word is out among traf-
fickers, among smugglers, among oth-
ers seeking to illegally enter the
United States that coming with a child
is a get-out-of-jail-free pass. According
to the Border Patrol, family unit ap-
prehensions have increased by 463 per-
cent since last year, with increases of
2,100 percent in El Paso and 1,034 per-
cent in Del Rio.
I also learned of a recent pilot pro-
gram that used rapid DNA tests to dis-
cover whether these family units were
real. Nearly 30 percent were found to be
fraudulent in the Rio Grande Valley. In
other words, the adults bringing kids
into the United States illegally weren’t
related to the children.
One of the most tragic elements of
the crisis is the number of children
who are being trafficked, who are being
physically abused, sexually abused, and
neglected. Often they are being used as
pawns.
That is not all. In the Rio Grande
Valley, 60 percent of Border Patrol
Agents are now helping to process and
care for children and family units.
That means only 40 percent are dedi-
cated to border security. More than
half the Border Patrol agents in our
Nation’s busiest crossing point for ille-
gal immigrants are not on the border
stopping narcotics traffickers and stop-
ping human traffickers because they
are instead changing diapers. Instead,
they are caring for children because
the volume is so massive.
Just recently, the Rio Grande Valley
Sector canceled their horseback patrol
because they lacked the manpower be-
cause they are instead caring for the
massive influx of illegal immigrants.
On average, they make 30 trips to the
hospital a day. On average, in the Rio
Grande Valley Sector, one child is born
each day to an illegal immigrant who
has come over. Last week, 12 people
died.
This is a crisis. By refusing to ad-
dress our border crisis, we invite child
smuggling and child abuse. That is
shameful, and that is a tragedy. We
know how many illegal immigrants are
being apprehended. We know more and
more illegal immigrants are trying to
get into our country, and we know Bor-
der Patrol doesn’t have the manpower
or the resources to handle a humani-
tarian crisis of this scale. It is a fact,
and it is a reality that our Democratic
colleagues need to face.
Nobody who is compassionate, no-
body who wants to be virtuous, nobody
who cares about other human beings
would want to perpetuate what is hap-
pening at the border for even a single
day. We should be angry. We should be
angry at politicians who say this is a
made-up crisis. We should be angry at
politicians who keep the loopholes in
place that ensure that more and more
children—more and more little boys
and girls—will be abused at the hands
of human smugglers.
While the passage of the $4.5 billion
border supplemental bill a few weeks
ago was a good first step, Democrats in
Congress need to finally do their job
and work with Republicans and work
with President Trump to secure our
border. We need to build a wall. We
need to enforce immigration laws al-
ready on the books. We need to reform
our amnesty laws to prevent asylum
abuse, and we need to support the
brave men and women of the Border
Patrol with all the resources they need
to effectively secure the border.
I have introduced legislation to se-
cure the border using the billions from
El Chapo’s criminal fortune that the
Department of Justice is seeking to
have criminally forfeited and use El
Chapo’s ill-gotten goods and those of
other drug lords to build the wall. The
EL CHAPO Act would reserve any
amounts criminally forfeited to the
Federal Government as a result of
criminal prosecution of El Chapo or
other drug kingpins for the building of
a border wall and other border security
assets.
I am also a cosponsor of the WALL
Act, which would fully fund the border
wall by closing existing loopholes that
provide illegal immigrants with Fed-
eral benefits and tax credits, all with-
out affecting the benefits and tax cred-
its used by American citizens.
These bills are just two commonsense
ways to secure the border. Everyone
should support taking money away
from murderers, from drug smugglers,
and from human traffickers such as El
Chapo and using it to prevent murder,
drug smuggling, and human traf-
ficking—all without costing American
taxpayers even a dime or adding any-
thing to the Federal deficit.
We also need more judges. We need to
close the loopholes in our asylum sys-
tem. Right now, immigration courts
have a backlog of about 900,000 pending
cases—nearly a million. Increasing the
number of immigration judges and pro-
viding an expedited process for asylum
claims is necessary so migrants who
don’t qualify for asylum can be quickly
returned to their home countries rath-
er than released into the United
States.
These reforms are necessary, and
they need to happen. We know how to
solve this problem. We don’t have to
ask theoretically because we have seen
it happen specifically. In the first 6
months of 2017, right after President
Trump was elected and sworn into of-
fice, illegal immigration dropped near-
ly 70 percent. It plummeted. I remem-
ber going back down to the valley in
early 2017 and asking the Border Patrol
agents: Why did the illegal crossings
drop? We hadn’t built a wall yet. We
hadn’t hired new Border Patrol agents.
What changed? What those Border Pa-
trol agents told me was the only thing
that changed is the human smugglers,
the traffickers, now believed there was
an administration in office that would
enforce the law that would deport them
if they came here illegally. That one
change—the traffickers believing the
administration would send them
home—dropped illegal immigration 70
percent.
Then what happened? Why did we see
this enormous deluge we are seeing
right now? Well, the answer is the Con-
gress put loopholes in the law that
mandate the release of children. In a
short timeframe, and under a court de-
cision called the Flores decision, adults
with a child get released as well. That
process is what is known as catch and
release. It means someone who is ap-
prehended is given a court date some
months or years into the future and
then are let go on the hope that they
will magically show up. Far too many
of them don’t show up.
What happened in the summer of 2017
was illegal immigrants would pick up
the phone and call their friends or fam-
ily back home and say: The policy
hasn’t changed. They still let us go. We
still get to stay. There are still no con-
sequences. Come on over.
Even worse than that, smugglers
learned that bringing a child is the
ticket to crossing illegally into this
country. There was a portion of the de-
tention facility I saw in the valley that
the officers refer to as ‘‘daddy daycare’’
because it was simply filled with young
single men who had little kids with
them. Five years ago, 2 percent of sin-
gle men had kids. Today, 50 percent of
single men have kids because if you
grab a little boy or a little girl, you
can come over. I will tell you because
of the loopholes Congress has put in
place, Border Patrol has been forced to
release people who are convicted mur-
derers, forced to release people who are
convicted pedophiles, forced to release
adults with sexual assault convictions
and children in their custody. Why? Be-
cause it is so expedited that by the
time they find out about the convic-
tions, they have been forced to release
them already.
This is cruel. It is inhumane. When
the rapid DNA testing is showing that
nearly 30 percent of the adults are not
related to the kids, it explains why we
are hearing more and more reports of
children being rented or sold by the
cartels.
This has to stop—the political pos-
turing from the Democrats who are
running for President and the Demo-
crats in Congress who are refusing to

solve this problem. It is past time for
those games. It is time to solve this
crisis.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
HUMAN RIGHTS
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Amer-
ica’s strength is in our values. In that
vein, I rise to talk about human rights
and America’s historic role as a de-
fender of universal human rights for all
peoples.
I have been a member of the U.S.
Commission on Security and Coopera-
tion in Europe for many years. It is
also known as the Helsinki Commis-
sion. The Helsinki Commission is an
independent entity that brings to-
gether lawmakers and members of the
executive branch to represent the
United States at the OSCE, the Organi-
zation for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which was created to explicitly
promote human rights, democracy, and
economic, environmental, and military
cooperation among its 57 member na-
tions, including the United States and
Canada, all the countries of Europe,
and the former Soviet Union countries.
When the Helsinki Final Act was
signed in Finland in 1975, it enshrined
among its 10 Principles Guiding Rela-
tions between Participating States a
commitment to ‘‘respect human rights
and fundamental freedoms, including
the freedom of thought, conscience, re-
ligion or belief, for all without distinc-
tion as to race, sex, language or reli-
gion.’’
Few people have predicted the sweep-
ing, largely unforeseen consequences of
the adoption of this document. From
this one provision, among the 10 that
focus on human rights and funda-
mental freedoms, there were move-
ments sprung that embraced the Hel-
sinki process as a sword and as a
shield. Independent civil societies coa-
lesced around this basic principle and
used the followup processes that were
set in motion by the Helsinki Final Act
to hold their governments’ feet to the
fire.
In 1976, Congress established the Hel-
sinki Commission with the mandate to
monitor and report on compliance with
the Helsinki Final Act and, most im-
portantly, to press successive adminis-
trations to make human rights and de-
mocracy priorities in the conduct of
U.S. foreign policy.
In the subsequent years, Charter 77 in
Czechoslovakia, Solidarity in Poland,
and Watch Groups in Moscow, in Kyiv,
and in Vilnius sprang up to push for
the release of political prisoners and to
defend the rights of those who wanted
nothing more than to worship and to
have the freedom to advocate for re-
fuseniks and others who sought to re-
unite with their families across bor-
ders.
Through what became known as the
Helsinki process, Congress and pre-
vious administrations supported the
rights of Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel,
Natan Sharansky, and countless others
who emerged as leaders in their sup-
porting of the historic transitions to
freedom 30 years ago with the fall of
the Iron Curtain, the end of com-
munism, the unification of Germany,
and as President Bush proclaimed, a
‘‘Europe whole and free.’’ The Helsinki
process of monitoring, reporting, advo-
cating, urging, meeting, and witnessing
was a catalyst for these historic
changes.
Most importantly, at a time of his-
toric transition, the countries partici-
pating in the Helsinki process all ac-
knowledge that democracy was the
only form of government that we could
accept and that issues related to
human rights and democracy were
never matters of internal interference
but were matters of direct and legiti-
mate concern to all participating
states. This means, quite frankly, that
we have, under the Helsinki Accords,
the legitimate right—I would say the
obligation—to challenge the failure of
any one of those 57 states in its meet-
ing of its Helsinki commitments. That
is why it is right that we in the U.S.
Senate speak out against Russia or
speak out against Turkey or speak out
against any member state in the OSCE
when it violates these basic principles.
Over the July 4 work period, I was
proud to participate in the largest dele-
gation we have ever had to the annual
session of the OSCE Parliamentary As-
sembly. The Parliamentary Assembly—
facilitating lawmaker-to-lawmaker
interactions and discussions—was es-
tablished to complement the intergov-
ernmental work being done. One of the
OSCE’s strengths is that there is a par-
liamentary dimension. It is not just
government officials; it is also parlia-
mentarians who meet to implement
these commitments to human rights
and good governance.
The OSCE and its Parliamentary As-
sembly have been used to advance U.S.
interests, including their support for
human rights, free elections, com-
bating anti-Semitism and human traf-
ficking, and other initiatives that have
come from the U.S. Congress that have
then served as the foundation for U.S.
positions and, ultimately, agreements
that have been adopted by all 57 states
that have participated in the OSCE.
I remember discussions in the Con-
gress that dealt with fighting modern-
day slavery and trafficking and fight-
ing anti-Semitism. We initiated them
in the Congress. Through the Helsinki
Commission, we raised them in the
Parliamentary Assembly. They then
got raised in Vienna, which is where
the Ambassadors who represent all of
the states meet, and they were adopted
as policy in all 57 states. We have had
a very positive impact.
During this recent Parliamentary As-
sembly, I hosted an event called
‘‘Countering Hate: Lessons from the
Past, Leadership for the Future.’’ As I
stated during the event—and I will un-
derscore now—we have observed an up-
tick in hate-based instances across the
OSCE region and beyond—from Pitts-
burgh and Poway to Christ Church.
When we fail to act, we endanger not
only the most vulnerable within our
societies but the very foundations of
our democracies.
Given how much has been accom-
plished by the United States and others
through the OSCE over the past 30
years, it is deeply concerning to see
our own American President embrace a
drawback of universal human rights in
our own country and embrace dictators
around the world, who rule by promul-
gating fear and hate.
President Trump has called Turkish
President Erdogan a ‘‘friend’’ and has
shared love letters with the very brutal
Kim Jong Un after calling him ‘‘very
talented.’’ Turkey, which has been a
member of the OSCE since its incep-
tion and a member of NATO, has wit-
nessed a dramatic acceleration in
President Erdogan’s efforts to consoli-
date power and hobble his political op-
position.
His unrelenting pressure on the judi-
ciary and purges of its ranks of judges
and prosecutors have left respect for
the rule of law and due process in cri-
sis. Tens of thousands have been de-
tained in sweeping dragnets following
the failed coup, including independent
voices from virtually every sector of
society—opposition politicians, civil
society activists, journalists, aca-
demics, and many more. These vast
purges have had a chilling effect on the
free press and the freedom of expres-
sion.
The Committee to Protect Journal-
ists considers Turkey the world’s worst
jailer of journalists, with 68 docu-
mented cases, although a local Turkish
press freedom organization lists more
than 130 who have been detained. Re-
porters Without Borders ranks Turkey
as the 157th out of 180 countries for
press freedom—its lowest ranking ever.
Under emergency powers assumed by
President Erdogan after the coup at-
tempt, the Turkish Government closed
around 200 media outlets.
As for North Korea, Kim Jong Un has
one of the most deplorable human
rights records in the world.
According to Human Rights Watch:
Kim Jong Un—who serves as chairman of
the States Affairs Commission and head of
the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea—con-
tinues to exercise almost total political con-
trol. The government restricts all civil and
political liberties, including freedom of ex-
pression, assembly, association, and religion.
It also prohibits all organized political oppo-
sition, independent media, civil society, and
trade unions.
President Trump has been repeatedly
willing to take the word of former KGB
agent Vladimir Putin over his own in-
telligence services.
On March 3, 2018, in speaking about
Chinese President Xi during a private
fundraising speech at Mar-a-Lago, he
said:
Xi is a great gentleman. He’s now presi-
dent for life—president for life. No, he’s
great. And look, he was able to do that. I
think it’s great. Maybe we’ll have to give
that a shot someday.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4800 July 11, 2019
That is not who the President of the
United States should be embracing.
He has repeatedly praised Rodrigo
Duterte of the Philippines. This is the
same leader who independent press,
civil society groups, foreign govern-
ments, and international organizations
have all confirmed is engaged in the
extrajudicial killing of his own citi-
zens—work that President Trump
praised as doing an ‘‘unbelievable job
on the drug problem.’’
Mr. Duterte himself, as a former
mayor, has admitted to murdering peo-
ple. That Mr. Trump would laud Mr.
Duterte for his barbaric atrocities is
outrageous and is another indication
that instead of standing up for Amer-
ica’s values, President Trump con-
tinues to endorse leaders around the
world who violate the very principles
that America’s Founding Fathers en-
shrined in our Constitution.
I mention our Founding Fathers not
in passing, but as we recently cele-
brated our Independence Day on July 4,
I quote from the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, which set our Nation on a
path with the ideal that we hold these
truths to be self-evident; that all men
are created equal; that they are en-
dowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights; and that among
these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.
So I was particularly troubled that
within days of July 4, the Trump ad-
ministration, through Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo, unveiled what he
referred to as a Commission on
Unalienable Rights. In his announce-
ment, Secretary Pompeo called this
new Commission ‘‘one of the most pro-
found reexaminations of the
unalienable rights in the world since
the 1948 Universal Declaration.’’
I, along with many colleagues in the
U.S. Congress, fear that this Commis-
sion, whose purpose it is to advise the
Secretary of State based on the prin-
ciples of natural law and natural
rights, will undermine or curtail State
Department advocacy in critical
human rights arenas, including wom-
en’s health as well as LGBT rights.
For 243 years, with all of her imper-
fections, America has been a beacon for
peoples around the world. Those who
have embraced natural law have not
been welcoming. They peddle in hate
and division. The ACLU notes that ref-
erences to ‘‘natural law and natural
rights’’ are code words often used to
undermine the rights of women and the
LGBT community. This is just the lat-
est in a string of attacks on women and
the LGBT community by this adminis-
tration. If the President and the Sec-
retary of State want to build on pro-
tecting human rights, they will work
within the framework that the United
States helped to establish, not question
the definition or universality of human
rights.
IMMIGRATION
Mr. President, on immigration, dur-
ing his first days in office, the Presi-
dent began his administration by sign-
ing an Executive order that attempts
to impose travel bans on Muslims and
to ban refugees. He signed an Executive
order that greatly expanded the num-
ber of people who were subject to de-
tention and deportation, and prac-
tically speaking, he eliminated the
focus on the most dangerous, violent
criminals in our communities.
The President has tried to deny sanc-
tuary and asylum to those refugees
who legally seek protection in our
country as they flee violence and perse-
cution in their homelands.
He rescinded protections for the
Dreamers and those with temporary
protective status, which cast a cloud of
uncertainty over the futures of these
individuals and their families. It basi-
cally put an expiration date on their
backs.
In our communities, I think we all
know that the Dreamers and those
with temporary protected status now
have a fear as to whether their futures
will be here in the United States. They
have been here for a long time, and as
we all know, they are part of our com-
munities. The American values of em-
pathy and compassion seemingly no
longer find a champion in the White
House.
VOTING RIGHTS
Mr. President, on voting rights, the
Trump administration has rolled back
the clock by creating a so-called Presi-
dential Advisory Commission on Elec-
tion Integrity—designed to suppress
the vote—under the guise of trying to
prove the problem of nonexistent voter
fraud.
The Justice Department changed its
position and supported the use of voter
ID laws. It backtracked from its earlier
position that such laws were inten-
tionally racially discriminatory and
designed to suppress minority votes.
One of the principles of a democratic
state is to get the maximum participa-
tion in elections.
The Department of Justice has tried
to make it easier for States to purge
voters from their rolls, as well as to
make it easier for States to make vot-
ing changes that could disenfranchise
minority voters without there being
the proper Federal review or oversight.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE
Mr. President, on criminal justice,
the Department of Justice has aggres-
sively rolled back its use of consent de-
crees, like the one put in place in Bal-
timore under the Obama administra-
tion after Freddie Gray died in police
custody.
It is interesting. Since that episode,
we have had Members of Congress,
along with city officials, ask the Fed-
eral Government to do a pattern-or-
practice investigation on what led to
the consent order because we knew we
had a problem in Baltimore’s policing.
The Baltimore consent decree is a
perfect example of a joint local-Federal
partnership that will help overhaul the
police department and provide long-
overdue constitutional policing to the
citizens of Baltimore.
This Federal civil rights role is criti-
cally important—especially after a se-
ries of officer-involved shootings of Af-
rican-American residents—as we try to
rebuild trust between the police and
the communities they serve.
In terms of free press, President
Trump has consistently attacked the
free press, notwithstanding the First
Amendment’s protections, and particu-
larly has labeled critical news stories
as ‘‘fake news’’ in an effort to under-
mine any critical coverage of his ad-
ministration. He has shown callous dis-
regard for protecting journalists and
the free press both at home and abroad.
As Thomas Jefferson famously wrote,
‘‘The basis of our governments being
the opinion of the people, the very first
object should be to keep that right; and
were it left to me to decide whether we
should have a government without
newspapers or newspapers without a
government, I should not hesitate a
moment to prefer the latter.
In terms of LGBTQ rights, the Trump
administration has consistently argued
that businesses and government con-
tractors have a right to discriminate
against customers based on their sex-
ual orientation or gender identity. He
has nominated judges who want to turn
back the clock on equality and force
transgender individuals from the ranks
of our military.
Our Nation and form of government
are founded on ‘‘We the People of the
United States.’’ Yet this President is
doing all he can to lessen the power
and squelch the voices of perceived op-
position.
As we approach the second anniver-
sary of the deadly protests in Char-
lottesville, VA, I will never forget how
President Trump used his bully pulpit
to further divide our Nation by equat-
ing those who espoused White suprem-
acy with those who were protesting
against such White supremacist views.
Let us remember the great civil
rights leaders in our history who have
struggled to help our Nation form a
more perfect union, establish justice,
and secure the blessings of liberty, as
promised by our Constitution. The
deadly violence that occurred nearly 2
years ago must never be permitted to
happen again.
I strongly condemn all acts of intol-
erance and remain certain that the
moral arc of history, although long,
bends toward justice. What is good and
just in America is stronger than hate
and will prevail.
The Trump administration’s attack
on women’s healthcare is unconscion-
able. Women’s rights are human rights.
The President has taken action to
undermine the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, the ACA, finalized
administrative rules that allow dis-
criminatory practices to domestic and
global family planning providers, as
well as women seeking reproductive
healthcare.
One of the first actions President
Trump took in office was to impose an
expansion of the global gag rule, which

forces global health providers eligible
for U.S. assistance to choose between
receiving U.S. funds and providing
comprehensive healthcare and family
planning services to their patients.
What a horrible choice. You need the
money, but you have to provide the
services.
Trump’s global gag rule restricts vir-
tually all global health assistance pro-
vided by the U.S. Federal Government,
including from the Department of
State, USAID, and the Department of
Defense, impacting $8.8 billion in finan-
cial support for global health pro-
grams. Where is the U.S. leadership on
global health? The rule has eliminated
access to contraceptive services and
supplies for almost 26 million women
and girls around the world. This hurt
women in conflict zones and rural
areas, as well as refugees, women with
disabilities, and indigenous women.
President Trump has also imposed
the domestic gag rule, which restricts
physicians from providing complete in-
formation to patients about their
healthcare options and providing ap-
propriate referrals for care.
The new rule guts title X, the Na-
tion’s only Federal grant program dedi-
cated solely to providing individuals
with comprehensive family and related
preventive health services.
Women make up more than half the
population of this Nation. It is out-
rageous that President Trump continu-
ously implements policies that dis-
criminate against women’s healthcare.
We cannot allow women to be treated
this way here in the United States or
anywhere around the world.
‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evi-
dent, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable Rights, that
among these are Life, Liberty and the
pursuit of Happiness.’’ This has been
the American ideal and a guiding prin-
ciple for our Nation since our founding.
All men and women are created equal.
Each one of us on this Earth deserves
freedom, respect, and dignity.
For generations, the United States
has stood as the sentinel, defending
these universal rights. I would think
Republicans and Democrats alike agree
with that statement. The outlier is
President Trump. This President has
done everything in his power within
the borders of our Nation and overseas
to diminish human rights and dis-
regard the rule of law. He continues to
embrace dictators, opening the doors of
the Oval Office to men who deserve
prosecution more than a welcome em-
brace by the leader of the free world.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to uphold their oath to defend
and protect the Constitution of the
United States and to work together to
restore America’s role as the defender
of universal human rights.
I yield the floor.

BRAUN). The Senator from Ohio.
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MOON LANDING
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am
here on the floor this afternoon to talk
about a landmark moment in human
history that occurred 50 years ago next
week—the Apollo 11 mission that land-
ed the first person on the Moon.
Today, 50 years after that incredible
feat, we sometimes take for granted
that we explored the Moon. But think
for a moment about the generations of
men and women from the beginning of
time until July 20, 1969, who looked up
at the Moon’s pale light in wonder at
what secrets and insights may lay on
its surface. Think about the countless
paintings and poems depicting the
Moon as an unchanging and unknow-
able presence in the sky. Think about
how, after hundreds of thousands of
years of such mystery and reverence,
we actually went there.
On July 20, 1969, the world watched in
breathless awe as grainy footage came
in of the Moon landing. It was beamed
in from the lunar surface 289,000 miles
away to millions of TV screens all
around the globe. As a 13-year-old teen-
ager, I saw two figures clad in bulky
spacesuits bounce across the screen
against the stark black-and-white
landscape.
As anyone who witnessed it can re-
member and tell you about, there was
a great sense of pride as Americans—
Americans who broke the earthly
bonds that had tethered our ancestors
for eons, to set foot on the surface of a
body we only saw in the distant night
sky. I also felt pride as our pristine
American flag was unfurled and plant-
ed on the Moon’s surface, forever
marking our country’s trailblazing
spirit. I felt pride in being from Ohio,
as my fellow Buckeye, Neil Armstrong,
was the very first man to step onto the
Moon, continuing our legacy in the
State of Ohio as a pioneer in flight and
in aerospace.
In 2003, actually, Congress officially
designated Ohio the ‘‘Birthplace of
Flight’’ due to the Wright brothers.
They were born and raised in Dayton,
OH, and it was in their bicycle shop
that they dreamed up and researched
the first fixed-wing aircraft anywhere.
But for such a lofty title, Ohio has
played an even greater role in the story
of mankind’s progress in the skies and
beyond—even beyond the Wright broth-
ers. In fact, one of my predecessors in
this seat here in the Senate was John
Glenn, the first American to orbit the
Earth. In all, two dozen astronauts to
date are natives of Ohio—more than
any other State—and I am proud to say
that many more call it home today.
Our legacy of flight in Ohio continues
today. In Dayton, OH, we have the Na-
tional Air Force Museum, which houses
more than 300 historic aircraft. Wright-
Patterson Air Force Base—one of the
largest in the country—trains not only
our pilots in our Air Force, but those of
our allies all around the world.
Just last month, I had the honor of
announcing, with Neil Armstrong’s
widow, Carol Armstrong, that the
Smithsonian will be bringing a special
exhibit on the Apollo 11 mission enti-
tled ‘‘Destination Moon’’ to Cin-
cinnati’s own Museum Center.
On that day in 1969, Neil Armstrong
became all of our heroes, and it was at
a time when our country was deeply di-
vided over the war in Vietnam and
other social and cultural issues. At a
time when we were yearning for heroes,
Neil Armstrong inspired us and
brought us together as a country.
I have one story I would like to share
that I thought about while walking
over this afternoon. It is about how
Neil Armstrong inspired a particularly
important group of Americans.
In 2011, the year before Neil Arm-
strong died, he came here to the U.S.
Capitol at my request to join my wife
Jane and me at our swearing-in cere-
mony. I was elected in 2010, and the
swearing-in was early in 2011. As we
walked into the Capitol, we looked up
on the left and saw a mural, and it is a
mural that is still down on the first
floor of this Capitol on the Senate side,
and it is of Neil Armstrong on the face
of the Moon. I pointed it out to Neil
and his wife Carol—his wonderful wife
Carol who was with us. Neil’s comment
was, that is interesting. The 30 or 40
people who were with us walking into
the Capitol that day—they didn’t think
it was interesting; they thought it was
amazing.
I later found out that Neil Armstrong
was the only American living to have a
mural painted of him in the U.S. Cap-
itol.
That night at dinner, one of my other
friends, Col. Tom Moe, came to me and
asked if he could speak with Neil Arm-
strong and whether I would introduce
him to Neil. I said: Of course.
Col. Tom Moe is a hero in his own
right, an Air Force pilot who was shot
down over North Vietnam. He spent
many years in the prison called the
Hanoi Hilton with our former colleague
John McCain—a true hero.
When we went over to see Neil Arm-
strong, Col. Tom Moe shared a story
with him. He said that the prison
guards in the North Vietnamese prison
were intent upon telling the prisoners
that America was falling apart, that
there were protests on the streets,
which was true, that the country was
deeply divided, and that America was
going backward. He said in particular
they didn’t want the prisoners to know
that America had accomplished what
President Jack Kennedy had laid out
as an ambitious vow, which was to go
to the Moon by the end of the decade.
They had kept that from them. Then
one day, the prison guards somehow let
a letter go to one of the prisoners from
his mom, and that letter included a
postage stamp, of course. Guess what
was on the postage stamp. A photo-
graph of Neil Armstrong stepping onto
the Moon.
Colonel Moe told Neil Armstrong
that it was incredibly inspiring. It lift-

said you could just feel the momentum
building and the morale improve.
Neil Armstrong was not a very emo-
tional guy, but when he heard that
story, he became very emotional, as
did Colonel Moe.
That is just one more example of
where Neil Armstrong inspired all of
us—in this case, a group of Americans
who richly deserved and badly needed
that inspiration.
Over the years, my family and I have
come to know the Armstrong family.
Carol Armstrong is still in Cincinnati,
a dear friend. We were his neighbors in
Cincinnati.
As we have shared stories in the lead-
in to the 50th anniversary of the Moon
landing, I have been reminded of how
extraordinary it was that this towering
figure had truly been such a modest,
unassuming man despite all the noto-
riety.
In my view, how he handled the spot-
light into which he was thrust said as
much about Neil Armstrong as the
time he spent on the Moon a half cen-
tury ago. He was a true hero, but even
before he blazed trails through the cos-
mos, Neil was already contributing to
Ohio’s rich legacy of pushing the
boundaries of flight. He had already
served his Nation with bravery and
skill on Gemini 8. As a test pilot push-
ing the envelope, he had strapped him-
self into terrifying-looking contrap-
tions with gigantic flame-belching en-
gines tied onto huge fuel tanks.
Before he was a test pilot, he distin-
guished himself through his service to
his country as a naval aviator—among
other things, flying 78 combat missions
over the Korean Peninsula. In one such
mission, in fact, he was forced to eject
from his plane into enemy territory,
holding out long enough, thank God,
for the U.S. Marines to locate him and
escort him to safety.
For all of these accomplishments,
this son of Ohio received the highest
honors a grateful nation could bestow:
the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the
Congressional Gold Medal, and the
Congressional Space Medal of Honor.
God smiled upon Neil Armstrong
throughout his extraordinary life. Neil
returned the favor by living his life
with honor and dignity.
In 2012, Neil returned to the heavens
above, this time venturing into the
Kingdom of Heaven. I had the honor of
being among those who delivered the
eulogy at his funeral. Then, as today, I
remembered him as a hero and as a
friend. He was a humble Midwesterner
and a proud Ohioan who believed that
the honor of serving his country and
meeting great challenges in his own
stoic way was all the reward he de-
served. He was a refreshing counter-
weight to the celebrity culture we too
often embrace today.
The Apollo mission was many things
to many people. To the world, it was
mankind’s greatest journey to date, a
daring sojourn to the crown jewels in
the night sky. For Americans, it was
an affirmation of America’s
exceptionalism, that we could beat the
Soviets and respond to their Sputnik
Program by following through on
President Kennedy’s bold vow to land a
man on the Moon by the end of the
1960s.
For me, and for thousands of other
young boys and girls across Ohio, it
was simply the next act in our State’s
leadership in aviation, done with that
quintessential Midwestern resolve and
humility.
As Neil once so eloquently said, ‘‘The
important achievement of Apollo was
demonstrating that humanity is not
forever chained to this planet and our
visions go rather further than that, and
our opportunities are unlimited.’’
Fifty years on, as we look ahead to
chart our next voyage to the stars, let
us always remember the bravery and
patriotism and the humility of Neil,
also of his other astronauts—Michael
Collins, Buzz Aldrin—and the thou-
sands of men and women who sup-
ported them on Earth, and the many
courageous astronauts who preceded
and followed them. Let the Apollo 11
mission be an example of what our
great country can do when we come to-
gether to achieve the seemingly impos-
sible.
Let us commit to come together into
the future, into the distant horizons.
Like the Apollo 11 exhibit exhibiting
American leadership and benefiting all
of mankind, there is more for us to do.
I yield the floor.

jority leader is recognized.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
REMEMBERING MARIAN SPENCER
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor a great Ohioan and
transformational civil rights leader,
Marian Spencer. Born in Gallipolis,
OH, as the granddaughter of a slave,
Spencer honored her grandfather by
dedicating her life to fighting for a
more equal and inclusive country.
Spencer became a member of the
NAACP at the young age of 13 and is
best known for leading the fight to in-
tegrate Coney Island and its swimming
pools in the 1950s.
After graduating from high school,
Spencer attended the University of
Cincinnati, where she made Cincinnati
her adopted home and campaigned to
integrate the university’s Whites-only
college prom. From there, she chaired
the education committee of her local
NAACP branch and helped raise $30,000
to desegregate Cincinnati Public
Schools, before becoming the chapter’s
first female president in 1981.
Spencer believed in the power of ac-
tivism as a means of social change, and
her efforts led her to becoming the first
African-American woman elected to
Cincinnati City Council. Spencer gave
a voice to the disenfranchised and
underrepresented, and she will be re-
membered as trailblazer for civil
rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights,
and the environment.
We lost Marian Spencer this July,
but her legacy will live on for genera-
tions. Her leadership and progressive
ideas had a profound effect on our city,
our State, and our Nation, and her
work will remain a source of great
pride for Ohioans. I am proud to honor
Marian Spencer for her contributions
to making our country a little freer
and a little more just.∑

TRIBUTE TO MIKE AND TARI
CONROY
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I rise to recognize Mike and Tari
Conroy for their impact on Ravalli
County and the surrounding areas.
Through their work as bluegrass musi-
cians, the Conroys have brought de-
light to the hearts of their Montanan
listeners.
The Conroys’ devotion to bluegrass
extends beyond their respective play-
ing of the banjo, guitar, and other tra-
ditional bluegrass instruments. The
events the Conroys take part in, such
as celebrating the birthday of a 90-
year-old U.S. Army veteran or the clos-
ing of an essential Missoula landmark,
represent the very best of Montana. It
is no surprise that Mr. Conroy is the
president of the Montana Bluegrass As-
sociation.
Additionally, the Conroys have
worked tirelessly to share their love of
bluegrass music with their fellow Mon-
tanans by organizing the annual
Hardtimes Bluegrass Festival, which
takes place just south of Hamilton,
MT. This festival brings numerous
bluegrass bands from the Northwestern
United States to perform in Montana.
Despite the financial and logistical
hurdles, the Conroys are committed to
sharing their passion with their fellow
Montanans. As the festival enters its
11th year, it has truly become a cul-
tural staple of the Bitterroot.

IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS

REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT
COLONEL MICHAEL HEALEY
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I
wish in tribute to Lieutenant Colonel
Michael Healey of the British Royal
Artillery Regiment, a great gunner, an
officer of the highest quality, a British
patriot, and a beloved friend of Okla-
homa and America.
On June 29, we lost Mike Healey at
the age of 67 after a 4-year battle with
cancer. Just as in life, he faced his last
fight with courage and vigor, without
complaint, and with that famous Brit-
ish stiff upper lip. Mike was taken from
us too soon, but his memory will be
with us always, and his service will live
on as a testament to the bonds of affec-
tion and friendship that still animate
the special relationship between the
United States and the United Kingdom.
Mike spent a lot of time in my State
during the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s
at a little place called Fort Sill, in
Lawton, OK. Many of you know that
Fort Sill is the home of the U.S. Army
Field Artillery and Air Defense Artil-
lery.
Major Mike Healey first came to Fort
Sill in January 1988 to replace Major
Ian Dowdswell as the british exchange
instructor in the field artillery ad-
vanced course, which is now called the
captains career course.
Mike was already very experienced as
a major in the British Artillery and
brought that tactical and technical
knowledge to share with U.S. students
and faculty. He made it through the in-
structor ‘‘murder boards’’ in record
time, as he had been an instructor in
his own Army. He very quickly grasped
the American acronyms and organiza-
tion for combat. Mike did a fantastic
job as an instructor and was respected
by his students and colleagues.
Mike came back to Fort Sill in 1997,
after a promotion to lieutenant colo-
nel, and became the British liaison of-
ficer to the U.S. Field Artillery. He
represented the British Army excep-
tionally well in all aspects of the new
position. One of the main reasons he
was promoted and was allowed to re-
turn to America so soon was that he
spoke ‘‘American’’ so well.
Lieutenant Colonel Healey returned
for a third time to Oklahoma in 2005 to
be, once again, the British LNO to the
U.S. Field Artillery School but with
the added responsibility of also serving
as the British air defense artillery liai-
son officer. LTG Dave Valcourt was the
commanding general of Fort Sill at the
time, and specifically requested that
the British Army send Mike back to
Fort Sill for yet another tour to help
guide the base through a critical period
as it absorbed the U.S. Army ADA
School from Fort Bliss.
Lieutenant Colonel Healey’s combat
theater service gave him immediate
credibility with his American com-
rades in arms. Mike served in the Falk-
lands War with British forces in 1984
and in Iraq alongside American units
in 1991. In addition to his combat cre-
dentials, he coordinated joint/combined
Cold War exercises and security proce-
dures, working with Americans in Ger-
many in 1979 and 1990 and in Turkey in
1996.
As a truly solemn and high-visibility
assignment, Mike commanded the
Queen’s Guard at Edinburgh Castle in
Scotland, marching the men down the
Royal Mile to Holyrood Castle, fol-
lowed by dinner with the Queen in 1983.
Mike was a graduate of Sandhurst
Military Academy, the Royal Field Ar-
tillery School at Larkhill, and earned a
master’s degree at Schrivenham. He
also had a BA in economics from Man-
chester University.
His military awards include the U.S.
Army Field Artillery Association St.
Barbara’s Medal, the U.S. Army Meri-
torious Service Medal, the British Gulf
War Medal, and the Queen Elizabeth
Golden Jubilee Medal for special rec-
ognition during the commemoration of
the Queen’s 50th year on the throne.
Lieutenant Colonel Healey’s greatest
satisfaction and proudest moment, by
his own admission, was when he au-
thored, staffed, and presented a new
Ministry of Defense Command policy
to House of Commons on ensuring mili-
tary members were not forgotten once
they left the military and that their
sacrifices were acknowledged in the ci-
vilian world with special accommoda-
tions.
He and his wife, Mo, were the con-
summate hosts at numerous official
functions they personally planned and
catered at Fort Sill, to include their
memorable farewell bash in 2007 at the
Polo Field.
Mike Healey loved America, Okla-
homa, and the U.S. Army Field Artil-
lery. He was constantly amazed by the
wide-open spaces in the American
West, the 300-plus sunny days per year,
and how friendly the people were.
Mike unabashedly adopted the
United States as his second home and
voluntarily spent nearly a third of his
military career in Oklahoma.
In fact, he thought so much of this
great land that he specifically re-
quested Old Glory be draped across his
casket next to the Union Jack at his
military funeral, which will be on July
19 in Thirsk, England. I am personally
requesting that an American flag be
flown over the Capitol in honor of Mike
Healey and his service, not just to his
own country but also for his service to
our country. That flag will then be
transported to England for the burial
by Lieutenant General Valcourt, Re-
tired, who will also deliver a portion of
Mike’s eulogy.
With this extraordinary request,
Mike performed one last act of service
by reminding his British compatriots
and his American friends of our proud
history and all that we still have to
achieve together.
In January 1941, President Franklin
Roosevelt sent Harry Hopkins as his
personal envoy to meet Prime Minister
Winston Churchill. At dinner one
night, Hopkins rose and quoted from
the Book of Ruth: ‘‘Whither thou goest
I will go, and whither thou lodgest I
will lodge. Thy people shall be my peo-
ple, and thy God my God.’’ He then
added, ‘‘even to the end.’’ Mike Healey
lived those words. He saw firsthand
why Americans love their country, and
he became a true ‘‘forward observer’’ of
the American dream. We are all better
off for knowing Mike, and we will never
forget all he has done for the U.S.
Army, the Field Artillery School, the
State of Oklahoma, and the United
States of America.∑

Lieutenant Colonel Heath deployed to
Iraq to serve with Marine Wing Sup-
port Squadron-473 as a logistics officer.
In 2013, Lieutenant Colonel Heath at-
tended the Naval Command and Staff
course at the Naval War College. Upon
graduation, she served as the oper-
ational sponsor for Marine for Life,
Manpower and Reserve Affairs in
Quantico, VA. In this capacity, she
sought to ensure that all Marines
maintained a connection to the Corps,
regardless of their stage in life. Lieu-
tenant Colonel Heath continued her
service to the Nation when she joined
the operational sponsor for the Readi-
ness Support Program, Marine Corps
Individual Reserve Support Activity,
Marine Forces Reserve, New Orleans,
LA.
Since 2016, Lieutenant Colonel Heath
has served in the Office of Legislative
Affairs, Headquarters, Marine Corps,
Pentagon. In this capacity, she has
worked tirelessly while balancing mili-
tary, political, and budgetary priorities
for the Congress.
Upon retirement, Lieutenant Colonel
Heath will return to the great State of
Oklahoma and will reside in Norman,
OK. On behalf of my colleagues and the
entire U.S. Senate, I want to person-
ally thank Lieutenant Colonel Heath
for her more than two decades of serv-

TRIBUTE TO KATHY HADLEY
∑ Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor a longtime advocate for
sustainable living and conservation
who has worked tirelessly to make the
world around her a better, healthier
place.
Kathy Hadley is retiring from her po-
sition as the executive director of the
National Center for Appropriate Tech-
nology in Butte, MT. For over 30 years,
Kathy has devoted her life to NCAT’s
mission: championing small-scale,
local, and sustainable solutions to re-
duce poverty, promote healthy commu-
nities, and protect natural resources.
Kathy has had a hand in some of the
most important conservation move-
ments of the past 30 years, and pro-
grams at NCAT under her direction
have ranged from developing energy-
saving strategies for low-income com-
munities to helping out farmers look-
ing to adopt more sustainable farming
practices, as well as AmeriCorps pro-
gram that gives young people an oppor-
tunity to serve the public while work-
ing towards clean air and clean water.
I am particularly fond of the Armed-
to-Farm Program, which teaches vet-
erans the ins and outs of farming.
Her career has also led her to distin-
guished service with the National Wild-
life Federation, where she fought to en-
sure wildlife continues to thrive in our
rapidly changing world.
I am thankful for Kathy’s commit-
ment to the environment, to sustain-
ability, and to building a better future
for our children and grandchildren. She
has left an indelible mark on Montana
and on the world, and I wish her and
her husband Wayne and their two sons,
Erik and Liam, the best.
Enjoy your retirement, and job well
done.∑

TRIBUTE TO JOHN FALKENBURY
∑ Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, today I
wish to pay tribute to Mr. John
Falkenbury, the president and chief op-
erating officer for the United Service
Organizations, USO, of North Carolina,
on his decades of service to the great
State of North Carolina.
For over a decade, since his initial
appointment as president and COO for
the USO of North Carolina in 2009,
John has been integral in coordinating,
planning, and leading the operations of
the USO State headquarters, five USO
fixed centers, and mobile centers in lo-
cations spanning the entire State.
John’s leadership skills were promi-
nently displayed in his ability to mobi-
lize thousands of volunteers over the
years to support countless Active-Duty
servicemembers, veterans, and their
families. John’s extensive resume is a
testament to his lifelong commitment
to public service, which includes his
past role as president and CEO of Five
Oaks Nursing Center in Concord, NC,
serving as the managing partner of the
Falkenbury Family LLC, and as the
president of the Stephen D. Falkenbury
Jr. Foundation in Charlotte, NC. Prior
to his work for the USO, John served in
the U.S. Army for 20 years, which in-
cluded numerous assignments across
the United States and in Germany.
The USO centers across the State of
North Carolina provide critical re-
sources and support to our men and
women in uniform and their families.
These services include transition as-
sistance, financial literacy, child edu-
cational programs, deployment, and
homecoming operations, military and
civilian outreach programs, Fallen and
Wounded Warrior escort services, and a
focus on providing the entire commu-
nity with support and assistance.
Through his leadership, dedication, and
passion for service, John Falkenbury
has been a champion in ensuring these
programs are readily available for any-
one who needs them.
The North Carolina USO has a strong
track record of dedicated support of
servicemembers at military installa-
tions, including Fort Bragg, Camp
Lejeune, and Seymour Johnson Air
Force Base. In 2016, when the dev-
astating Hurricane Matthew flooded
large portions of Eastern North Caro-
lina, John assisted in the delivery of
1,000 care packages via Blackhawk hel-
icopter to soldiers and civilians in af-
flicted areas. A USO mobile center de-
ployed near Lumberton, NC, for 5 days
to provide basic necessity items, a BBQ
dinner, satellite access, and internet
service to over 400 servicemembers.
As a Senator, a member of the USO
Congressional Caucus, and a North Car-
olinian, I am pleased to congratulate
John Falkenbury on his retirement and
for his impressive career of public serv-
ice and steadfast commitment to our
country.∑

H.R. 2360 which seeks to establish a Renew-
able Energy Grant Program within the
United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) for the purpose of promoting renew-
able energy in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Is-
lands of the United States; to the Committee
on Energy and Natural Resources.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 1084
Congressman Ted W. Lieu, the Resident
Commissioner of Puerto Rico in Washington
D.C., the Hon. Jenniffer González-Colón, and
Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett introduced
H.R. 2360 on April 25, 2019, which directs the
Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Re-
newable Energy Grant Program for the pur-
pose of awarding funds to not-for-profit enti-
ties so they may develop and use renewable
energy systems.
This legislation, which shall be known as
the ‘‘Renewable Energy for Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands Act,’’ seeks to pro-
mote investment in renewable energy, en-
ergy efficiency, energy storage, and
microgrid and smart grid projects. The orga-
nizations that are awarded these grants may
receive technical assistance from the De-
partment of Energy national laboratories.
Furthermore, the measure appropriates
funds for the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct a study regarding
renewable energy and energy efficiency in
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands of the
United States not later than one hundred
and eighty (180) days after the date of enact-
ment of the Act. The study shall consider
the potential to modify existing electric
power systems, use renewable energy
sources, expand the use of microgrids, and
improve energy resiliency.
It is worth noting that H.R. 2360 is con-
sistent with the recently approved Act No.
17–2019, known as the ‘‘Puerto Rico Energy
Public Policy Act,’’ which seeks to trans-
form our electrical system into one that is
robust, resilient, reliable, eco-friendly, and
affordable, and that serves as the basis for
the Island’s economic development. Act No.
17, supra, directs the elimination of electric
power generation from fossil fuels in Puerto
Rico and, for such purpose, establishes a new
and ambitious Renewable Portfolio Standard
that requires that forty percent (40%) energy
generation from renewable sources by 2025;
sixty percent (60%) by 2040; and one hundred
percent (100%) by 2050. In addition, it encour-
ages the use of energy storage technology for
all consumer levels, promotes the integra-
tion of distributed generation and
microgrids, and seeks to attain thirty per-
cent (30%) energy efficiency by 2040.
However, it is a fact that Puerto Rico and
the Virgin Islands are exposed to suffering
the consequences of catastrophic hurricanes
such as Irma and Maria which left millions
of U.S. citizens without electric power serv-
ice for a long period of time. The passage of
these two hurricanes in 2017 and the reality
of climate change has once again raised
awareness of the importance of having an
electrical system that is resilient to weather
events that have become stronger and more
frequent.
H.R. 2360 complements the efforts made by
the Government of Puerto Rico to transform
our electrical system and contributes to-
wards achieving one hundred percent (100%)
energy generation from renewable sources by
2050, therefore, the Senate of Puerto Rico
supports this important initiative.
Be it resolved by the Senate of Puerto Rico:
Section 1.—To express the support of the
Senate of Puerto Rico to, and request the
United States Congress to pass H.R. 2360
which seeks to establish a Renewable Energy
Grant Program within the United States De-
partment of Agriculture (USDA) for the pur-
pose of promoting renewable energy in Puer-
to Rico and the Virgin Islands of the United
States of America.
Section 2.—Upon its approval, a copy of
this Resolution translated into English shall
be delivered to the leadership of the United
States Congress, congress members Ted W.
Lieu and Stacey Plaskett, and the Resident
Commissioner of Puerto Rico in Washington
D.C., Jenniffer González-Colón.
Section 3.—This Resolution shall take ef-
fect upon its approval.

insurance, creating unprecedented demand
for state and federal disaster recovery assist-
ance; and
Whereas, The FEMA application process is
so duplicative and confusing, and the United
States Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment regulations are so complex, that
many survivors give up trying to navigate
the system and, therefore, receive no assist-
ance; and
Whereas, Consolidating funding for recov-
ery housing programs into a single Disaster
Housing Response and Recovery Block Grant
would increase efficiency, save taxpayer dol-
lars, and speed the recovery process by com-
bining FEMA’s short-term programs and
HUD’s long-term programs: Now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, That the Senate of the State of
Texas, 86th Legislature, hereby respectfully
urge the United States Congress to enact
legislation to consolidate disaster recovery
housing funding into a single Disaster Hous-
ing Response and Recovery Block Grant;
and, be it further
Resolved, That the secretary of the senate
forward official copies of this resolution to
the president of the United States, to the
president of the Senate and the speaker of
the House of Representatives of the United

POM–113. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Hawaii urging the United
States Congress to amend federal law to en-
sure that victims of sexual harassment and
sexual assault who might otherwise be forced
into arbitration and silence instead have ac-
cess to the courts; to the Committee on the
Judiciary.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 11
Whereas, access to the judicial system,
whether federal or state, is a fundamental
right of all Americans that should extend
fully to persons who have been subjected to
sexual harassment and sexual assault; and
Whereas, many employers require their
employees, as a condition of employment, to
sign arbitration agreements mandating that
sexual harassment claims be resolved
through arbitration instead of judicial pro-
ceedings; and
Whereas, arbitration requirements are
often set forth in clauses found within the
fine print of lengthy employment contracts,
and that these clauses are typically pre-
sented in boilerplate ‘‘take-it-or-leave-it’’
fashion by employers; and
Whereas, additional concerns arise from
the secrecy requirements of arbitration
clauses, which disserve the public interest by
keeping both the harassment complaints and
any settlements confidential; and
Whereas, the prevalence of mandatory ar-
bitration clauses and the associated secrecy
requirements create a culture of silence that
protects serial perpetrators at the cost of
their victims; and
Whereas, the United States Senate and
House of Representatives are considering
legislation to address the issue of forced ar-
bitration and secrecy in sexual harassment
and sexual assault cases, and enable the vic-
tims of such egregious misconduct to seek
redress in the courts; and
Whereas, the Hawaii Women’s Legislative
Caucus applauds the female members of the
United States Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives who are working in a bipartisan
fashion to craft and advance this important
legislation: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, By the Senate of the Thirtieth
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular
Session of 2019, that members of the United
States Congress are respectfully requested to
amend federal law to ensure that victims of
sexual harassment and sexual assault who
might otherwise be forced into arbitration
and silenced instead have access to the
courts; and be it further
Resolved, That certified copies of this Reso-
lution be transmitted to the Speaker of the
United States House of Representatives,
President Pro Tempore of the United States
Senate, members of each state’s congres-
sional delegation, and Governor.
POM–114. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana
urging the United States Congress to take
such actions as are necessary to authorize
the garnishment of veterans’ disability bene-
fits to fulfill child support obligations; to the
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 7
Whereas, Civil Code Article 224 provides
that parents are obligated to support, main-
tain, and educate their child, and the obliga-
tion to educate a child continues after mi-
nority as provided by law; and
Whereas, 5 CFR Part 581, Subpart A pro-
vides which moneys received by a civilian
employee for services rendered to a govern-
mental entity are subject to garnishment for
the purpose of enforcing the legal obliga-
tions of obligors to provide child support;
and
Whereas, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 659, the
United States consents to the withholding
and garnishing of income of an individual for
the enforcement of the individual’s child
support and alimony obligations; and
Whereas, 42 U.S.C. 659 further provides that
the federal government will allow under cer-
tain circumstances the garnishment of serv-
ice-connected disability compensation paid
by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to
former members of the armed forces for the
purpose of enforcing child support and ali-
mony obligations; and
Whereas, in Rose v. Rose, 481 US 619 (1987),
the Supreme Court held that not only could
a state consider the amount of disability
benefits received by a veteran in setting the
amount of child support, but also, once a
child support obligation had been created,
the veteran’s disability benefits could be
used to satisfy that obligation; and
Whereas, in the same case, Justice Mar-
shall, quoting the legislative record, de-
scribes the purpose of veterans’ disability
benefits as compensation for impaired earn-
ing capacity and ‘‘to provide reasonable and
adequate compensation for disabled veterans
and their families’’; and
Whereas, as of February 2019, the current
total for child support arrears in Louisiana
is $1,923,958,949.00 and less than one percent
of that amount has been collected; and
Whereas, adequate child support is vital to
the well-being of children and families in our
state: Therefore, be it
Resolved That the Legislature of Louisiana
does hereby memorialize the United States
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to authorize the garnishment of vet-
erans’ disability benefits to fulfill child sup-
port obligations; be it further
Resolved That a copy of this Resolution be
transmitted to the presiding officers of the
Senate and the House of Representatives of
the Congress of the United States of America
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation.

SENATE RESOLUTION 274—EX-
PRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH
FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS
WHO HAVE LOST LIVES, FREE-
DOMS, AND OTHER RIGHTS FOR
ADHERING TO THEIR BELIEFS
AND PRACTICES, AND CON-
DEMNING THE PRACTICE OF
NON-CONSENTING ORGAN HAR-
VESTING, AND FOR OTHER PUR-
POSES

MORAN, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. TILLIS, Mr.
COONS, Mr. BROWN, Ms. BALDWIN, Mr.
MARKEY, Mr. CASEY, Mr. RUBIO, Mr.
CRUZ, Mr. KING, Mr. BOOZMAN, Mr.
REED, Mr. COTTON, and Mr. CASSIDY)
submitted the following resolution;
which was referred to the Committee
on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 274
Whereas Falun Gong (also known as Falun
Dafa) is a Chinese spiritual discipline found-
ed by Li Hongzhi in 1992 that consists of spir-
itual and moral teachings, meditation, and
exercise, and is based upon the universal
principles of truthfulness, compassion, and
forbearance;
Whereas, during the mid-1990s, Falun Gong
acquired a large and diverse following, with
as many as 70,000,000 practitioners at its
peak;
Whereas, on April 25, 1999, an estimated
10,000 to 30,000 Falun Gong practitioners
gathered in Beijing to protest growing re-
strictions by the Government of the People’s
Republic of China on the activities of Falun
Gong practitioners, and the Government of
the People’s Republic of China responded
with an intensive, comprehensive, and unfor-
giving campaign against the movement that
began on July 20, 1999, with the banning of
Falun Gong;
Whereas the Constitution of the People’s
Republic of China guarantees basic rights,
including the freedoms of speech, associa-
tion, demonstration, and religion;
Whereas, in 1993, the Government of the
People’s Republic of China praised Li
Hongzhi for his contributions in ‘‘safe-
guarding social order and security’’ and
‘‘promoting rectitude in society’’;
Whereas, in many detention facilities and
labor camps, Falun Gong prisoners of con-
science have at times comprised the major-
ity of the population, and have been said to
receive the longest sentences and the worst
treatment, including torture;
Whereas, according to overseas Falun Gong
and human rights organizations, since 1999,
from several hundred to a few thousand
Falun Gong adherents have died in custody
from torture, abuse, and neglect;
Whereas a review of the Government of the
People’s Republic of China by the United Na-
tions Human Rights Council’s Working
Group on the Universal Periodic Review in
November 2018, recommended that China
‘‘[e]nd prosecution and persecution on the
basis of religion or belief, including for Mus-
lims, Christians, Tibetan Buddhists and
Falun Gong’’;
Whereas the United Nations Committee
Against Torture and the Special Rapporteur
on Torture have expressed concern over the
allegations of organ harvesting from Falun
Gong prisoners, and have called on the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China to
increase accountability and transparency in
the organ transplant system and punish
those responsible for abuses;
Whereas the killing of religious or political
prisoners for any purpose, including for the
purpose of selling their organs for trans-
plant, is an egregious and intolerable viola-
tion of the fundamental right to life;
Whereas voluntary and informed consent is
the precondition for ethical organ donation,
and international medical organizations
state that prisoners, deprived of their free-
dom, are not in the position to give free con-
sent and that the practice of sourcing organs
from prisoners is a violation of ethical guide-
lines in medicine;
Whereas the Government of the People’s
Republic of China and the Communist Party
of China continue to deny reports that many

organs are taken without the consent of pris-
oners, yet at the same time prevent inde-
pendent verification of the organ transplant
system in China;
Whereas the organ transplantation system
in China does not comply with the World
Health Organization’s requirement of trans-
parency and traceability in organ procure-
ment pathways;
Whereas the Department of State Country
Report on Human Rights for China for 2018
reported that ‘‘[s]ome activists and organiza-
tions continue to accuse the government of
involuntarily harvesting organs from pris-
oners of conscience, especially members of
Falun Gong’’;
Whereas Huang Jiefu, director of the China
Organ Donation Committee, announced in
December 2014 that China would end the
practice of organ harvesting from executed
prisoners by January 1, 2015, but did not di-
rectly address organ harvesting from pris-
oners of conscience;
Whereas Freedom House reported in 2015
that Falun Gong practitioners comprise the
largest portion of prisoners of conscience in
China, and face an elevated risk of dying or
being killed in custody;
Whereas the Department of State Country
Report on Human Rights for China for 2016
reported that ‘‘some international medical
professionals and human rights researchers
questioned the voluntary nature of the
[transplantation] system, the accuracy of of-
ficial statistics, and official claims about the
source of organs’’;
Whereas a 2017 report by Freedom House
concluded that there was ‘‘credible evidence
suggesting that beginning in the early 2000s,
Falun Gong detainees were killed for their
organs on a large scale’’;
Whereas the Congressional-Executive Com-
mission on China (CECC) stated in 2018 that
‘‘[i]nternational organizations continued to
express concern over reports that organs of
detained prisoners have been used in numer-
ous organ transplant operations in China, in-
cluding those of Falun Gong practitioners’’
and also noted that medical professionals
and international advocacy organizations
‘‘disputed Chinese health officials’ claims
that organ procurement systems have been
reformed in compliance with international
standards, citing ethical concerns about
organ sourcing raised by short wait times for
organ transplants and discrepancies in data
on organ transplants’’;
Whereas the Independent Tribunal Into
Forced Organ Harvesting From Prisoners of
Conscience in China, chaired by Sir Geoffrey
Nice QC, issued a short form conclusion of
its final judgment in June 2019 finding that
‘‘forced organ harvesting has been com-
mitted for years throughout China on a sig-
nificant scale and that Falun Gong practi-
tioners have been one—and probably the
main—source of organ supply’’; and
Whereas the Tribunal also concluded that
it had seen no evidence that the organ trans-
plantation industry in China had been dis-
mantled, and absent a satisfactory expla-
nation as to the source of organs, that forced
organ harvesting continues in China today:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) expresses solidarity with Falun Gong
practitioners and their families for the lives,
freedoms, and rights they lost for adhering
to their beliefs and practices;
(2) emphasizes to the Government of the
People’s Republic of China that freedom of
religion includes the right of Falun Gong
practitioners to freely practice Falun Gong
in China;
(3) calls upon the Communist Party of
China to immediately cease and desist from
its campaign to persecute Falun Gong prac-
titioners and promptly release all Falun
Gong practitioners who have been confined,
detained, or imprisoned for pursuing their
right to hold and exercise their spiritual be-
liefs;
(4) condemns the practice of non-con-
senting organ harvesting in the People’s Re-
public of China;
(5) calls on the Government of the People’s
Republic of China and the Communist Party
of China to immediately end the practice of
organ harvesting from all prisoners of con-
science;
(6) calls on the Government of the People’s
Republic of China to allow an independent
and transparent investigation into organ
transplant abuses in China;
(7) urges the President to consider the ap-
plicability of existing authorities, including
the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Ac-
countability Act (22 U.S.C. 2656 note), to im-
pose targeted sanctions on those individuals
responsible for the persecution of Falun
Gong, including those engaging in a pattern
of non-consensual organ harvesting; and
(8) urges the President to ensure that the
United States Government highlights and
condemns human rights abuses perpetrated,
ordered, or directed by government officials
in China both publicly and in private engage-
ments with all relevant government officials
in China.

REMEMBERING WORLD WAR II
VETERAN, VAUDEVILLIAN MUSI-
CIAN AND FULLERTON RESI-
DENT, CHARLES PAUL
PECORARO
HON. GILBERT RAY CISNEROS, JR.
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, it is with
immense sadness and great humility that I rise
to mark the passing of another member of
America’s greatest generation. Charles Paul
Pecoraro was an entertainer, a businessman,
a veteran of the Second World War, a stalwart
member of the veteran’s community in South-
ern California, and most of all, a beloved fam-
ily man who passed away at the age of 100
on July 2, 2019.
Charles Pecoraro was born in the living
room of his parents’ small Manhattan apart-
ment on November 29, 1918. It was the height
of the First World War but also the age of rag-
time, when New York City had more horses
than cars. Charles’ life spanned and exceeded
what we now refer to as the American Cen-
tury.
Music was his family’s business and his
greatest passion. By the age of seven he was
accompanying his father, a classically trained
Sicilian mandolin player. Before he turned
twenty he was a veteran of the Vaudeville cir-
cuit, having toured up and down the East
Coast playing jazz guitar and earning his
chops in concert halls, speakeasies, dance
clubs, and Broadway orchestra pits.
When America entered the Second World
War, Charles didn’t hesitate. He joined the
Coast Guard and served aboard the Admiral
H.T. Mayo (AP–125). Charles sailed on the
ship’s shakedown cruise, then transiting the
Panama Canal, helped ferry troops during two
trips across the Atlantic. Transiting the Pan-
ama Canal again, Charles continued his serv-
ice in the Pacific where he and his shipmates
transported more troops to the Okinawa cam-
paign.
Evading U–Boats in the Atlantic and
outrunning Japanese submarines and aircraft
in the Pacific, Charles attained the rank of
Petty Officer 1st Class. He would ultimately re-
turn to his music career, before beginning
what his family refers to as his third act.
Charles met the love of his life Lucy, his wife
of 53 years. He, Lucy, and their only son
‘‘Charlie’’ Charles Pecoraro, Jr. moved to Ful-
lerton, California in the 1970s so that Charles
could join his brother Steve. Together, they
opened Angelo’s & Vinci’s, a neighborhood in-
stitution that still stands and continues to
thrive only blocks from my office. Its success
is carried on by the spirit of the two Sicilian-
American brothers who founded it.
Like many men of his generation, Charles
was modest to the extreme. A deeply devoted
religious and family man, he spoke little of his
wartime service. Only after his son was grown
did Charles’ neighbors in Fullerton convince
him to share his story with others. He joined
Fullerton’s American Legion Post 142, where
he became a quiet example of service to oth-
ers and a fixture at events. In fact, one of
those events was Fullerton’s Memorial Day
Remembrance Ceremony where I had the
honor to shake his hand.
Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you
and my distinguished colleagues join me in
honoring Charles Paul Pecoraro for his dedi-
cation to God, country, the arts and most of all
his surviving family members, wife Lucy and
son Charles. We are blessed to have had this
man for a century and to have his memory
continue to inspire us.

TRIBUTE HONORING MEGAN
POSER
HON. MAX ROSE
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to ask my distinguished colleagues
to join me in honoring my constituent Megan
Poser for her efforts to dispel the stigma of
addiction and to congratulate her on receiving
the Girl Scout Gold Award.
No community has been hit harder by the
opioid epidemic than Staten Island. And at just
17 years-old, Megan decided that she wasn’t
going to just sit around and wait for others to
do something about it. She decided she’d take
it upon herself to change the perception and
the stigma surrounding this crisis. Beyond her
research of the drug epidemic on Staten Is-
land, she took the initiative to become trained
in the use of naloxone, a drug that has saved
countless lives in our borough.
She also surveyed young people in our
community about the dangers of this crisis,
because she recognizes that the first step in
overcoming the opioid epidemic is addressing
the perception of the issue. She built on her
findings to create a presentation that she then
used to educate her fellow young Staten Is-
landers about the nature of the drug epidemic.
She became certified in Mental Health First
Aid which gives people the tools to help some-
one experiencing a mental health or sub-
stance use-related crisis.
The Girl Scouts have already recognized
Megan’s hard work and dedication to the Stat-
en Island community by presenting her with its
Gold Award, and it is my honor to do the
same here in the Halls of Congress. She has
successfully set herself up on a foundation of
service to her community that is already hav-
ing an impact on Staten Island, and I am con-
fident that she will continue to build on these
accomplishments to make the world a better
place.
So, Madam Speaker, today I ask my col-
leagues in the House of Representatives to
join me in recognizing Megan for her selfless
and compassionate service to the Staten Is-
land community. Megan’s commitment to ex-
tend this project beyond receiving the Girl
Scout Gold Award shows a continued love for
learning and educating her peers. Ms. Poser
is already an inspiring leader and I look for-
ward to seeing her other projects unfold.

TRIBUTE TO MRS. JADA RUSSELL
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the memory of my dear friend, Mrs.
Jada Russell, who passed away on July 2,
2019, after her battle with breast cancer. Jada
was a beloved and admired woman whose
light lit up any room she was in. She was a
brilliant professional known for her gift of mar-
keting and public relations work.
More importantly, Madam Speaker, Jada
was a woman full of compassion known for
her drive to give back to our hometown of Chi-
cago, Illinois and who used her talents to am-
plify the voices of those who have too-often
been left out of the conversation.
A ballet dancer in her youth, Jada was
known in her community as a strong leader
who was consistently willing to provide guid-
ance and support to her many friends and col-
leagues. After graduating from the Fashion In-
stitute of Technology, Jada began her career
at Guess Jeans, going on to work for Condé
Nast, and as a publicist for Johnson Pub-
lishing Company. As the founder of High Style
Marketing, Jada’s talents attracted the atten-
tion of such prominent figures as Dwayne
Wade, Common, Rhymefest, and Reverend
Jesse Jackson. Madam Speaker, I also had
the distinct privilege of working with Jada and
benefitted immensely from her passion and
expertise.
Though the world lost Jada too soon, we
take comfort in knowing that her memory lives
on in those who continue to love her: her de-
voted husband, Julius Russell, her sister, Sybil
Goodlett Smith, her father, Bill Goodlett, and
the countless lives she touched through her
good works.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my wife, Pau-
lette, my staff, and all those I serve in the 1st
Congressional District of Illinois, I extend my
heartfelt sympathies and prayers to Jada’s
friends and family as I mourn this deep loss
with them.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E898 July 11, 2019
about the horrendous treatment of immigrants
at detention facilities. A community-based or-
ganization in my district, Immigrant Families
Together (IFT), has been helping immigrant
families settle in the United States. They have
provided legal aid, food, shelter, clothing,
household goods and other assistance. In the
course of their work, they have collected some
horrific stories from the people they have
helped.
The stories range from inadequate medical
treatment to sexual abuse to refusal to provide
food, water and blankets. There are reports of
adults and children being denied necessary
medication, including a girl who suffered sei-
zures who was put on a bus without her medi-
cation. Women at a facility in Elloy, Arizona
were reportedly given one meal a day and ten
minutes to eat. There are also reports that
women at this facility were denied water for 3
days. Women at this facility also claim that
their laundry was done in unsanitary condi-
tions that allowed lice to infest their clothing.
One four-year-old boy was held in Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody
in Dallas, Texas for roughly two months during
the summer and fall of 2018. On his way to
the U.S. border he had broken a femur and
dislocated a hip. Although the boy was clearly
injured and ICE took him to the hospital for
examination, ICE refused to pay for his sur-
gery. Reportedly, ICE simply gave him Tylenol
for two months until he was released. Fol-
lowing his release, IFT paid for his surgery.
In Texas, a mother and her one-year-old in-
fant were held first in the ‘icebox’ for two days
and later in the ‘Dog Pound’ for four days. The
mother and child were given one aluminum
blanket for the two of them. When the mother
asked for a second blanket, an ICE officer
screamed at her. The infant became very sick
on their third day in the ‘Dog Pound,’ with
vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration. An ICE
doctor examined the child. Rather than pre-
scribing treatment, he recommended release.
IFT believes that they were released so that
the baby’s condition would not be ICE’s re-
sponsibility. The mother and child were put on
a bus for New York City, but the baby nearly
died in New Jersey and was taken to an
emergency room where he was given fluids
that enabled him to survive.
A pregnant teenager was released from Of-
fice of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody
in California one week before giving birth.
After she gave birth, it was discovered that
she had a urinary tract infection that was so
severe that she had a kidney infection.
One father related that his six-year-old
daughter was sexually assaulted by a boy at
an ORR facility in Casa Glendale, Arizona.
She reportedly was told it was her responsi-
bility to stay away from him and was told to
sign a document asserting that she under-
stood her obligation. A couple of weeks later,
the same boy assaulted her again and hit her.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in condemning a system that treats immi-
grants with such brutality and lack of compas-
sion.
HONORING THE LIFE OF JOSH
HARDY
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and recognize the late Josh Hardy, who
was senselessly murdered in the Virginia
Beach Municipal Center shooting. Virginia
Beach lost Josh far too soon.
Josh worked as an engineering technician
for the Department of Public Works for the
City of Virginia Beach for over four years.
Josh was a fun coworker, was never too
stressed to crack a joke, and always wore a
smile. Loved ones described Josh as a father
figure and as a kind-hearted man. He was
dedicated to his faith and shared it with oth-
ers. Josh’s life of hard work and service to the
community, as well as his kind heart, will for-
ever be remembered.
Josh will be missed by all his loved ones.
Hampton Roads significantly benefited from
his presence; he made our community a better
place. Today we remember and honor his life.

RECOGNIZING MEMPHIS MATH
TEACHER BERNELL JONES
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to commend Bernell Jones, a seventh grade
mathematics teacher at the White Station Mid-
dle School in Memphis for the last 16 years,
who was recently nationally recognized as an
inspiring educator.
Before he became a math teacher, Mr.
Jones was a computer specialist in the Ma-
rines, which explains his effectiveness in
keeping discipline in his classroom. ‘‘Class-
room management from a military perspective
is fairly easy,’’ Mr. Jones told The Commercial
Appeal newspaper. ‘‘You’re just so used to
telling people what to do. These are young
kids, and at school they will do the right
thing.’’
Mr. Jones earned a master’s degree in
teaching at Christian Brothers University he
began teaching at White Station Middle
School. An innovator in the classroom, he said
he seeks to make mathematics fun with ‘‘pi’’
days and a waffle festival. He has changed
the minds of many students who didn’t initially
like math—one became a math teacher her-
self.
Mr. Jones is an inspiration to his students
and to our whole community, and I congratu-
late him for this recognition.

INTRODUCTION OF THE RECOVER
ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the Reducing the Effects of the
Cyberattack on OPM Victims Emergency Re-
sponse Act of 2019 (the RECOVER Act),
which would require the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) to make permanent the
free identity protection coverage that Congress
required OPM to provide for 10 years to indi-
viduals whose Social Security Numbers were
potentially compromised during the OPM data
breaches. In 2015, OPM reported that the per-
sonally identifiable information of as many as
25.7 million current, former and prospective
federal employees and contractors was stolen
in two data breaches. I appreciate that Rep-
resentative C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER is co-
leading on this bill.
After OPM announced that it would offer
identity protection coverage of limited duration
and value, Senator BEN CARDIN and I intro-
duced the RECOVER Act in July 2015, which
would have provided affected individuals life-
time protection and at least $5 million in iden-
tity theft insurance. Congress subsequently in-
cluded a version of our bill in an enacted ap-
propriations bill, but limited the duration of the
protection. Under current law, OPM is only re-
quired to provide identity protection coverage
through fiscal year 2026. Under the bill we are
introducing today, OPM would be required to
provide coverage for the remainder of the lives
of affected individuals.
The current coverage is inadequate, particu-
larly considering that there is no limit to when
the thieves (or those they have shared the
stolen data with) may exploit the data. There-
fore, there should be no limit on the duration
of the coverage provided to affected individ-
uals. This bill would give current, former and
prospective federal employees and contractors
who were affected both some peace of mind
and protection. OPM failed to protect these
people. It follows that the government must do
the right thing to make up for its mistake.
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 85TH
BIRTHDAY OF MR. PAUL ROJAS
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I proudly
rise today to celebrate the 85th birthday of the
Honorable Paul Rojas and to recognize his
numerous contributions to Missouri’s Fifth
Congressional District. Mr. Rojas’ life has
been dedicated to the betterment of those
around him and it is an honor to have the op-
portunity to recognize his service.
Paul Rojas was born in 1935 in the
Westside Neighborhood of Kansas City, Mis-
souri. Mr. Rojas is the youngest of six boys
and a son of immigrant parents. Growing up,
he and his family frequented Guadalupe Cen-
ters and relied on their services after the
death of his mother. Their kindness and gen-
erosity showed Mr. Rojas the effect that a
community organization such as Guadalupe
Centers can have on a person’s life. Commu-
nity organizations provide not only tangible as-
sistance, but they also teach the importance of
helping one’s neighbor.
After attending Guadalupe Grade School, he
attended De La Salle High School. He worked
in the fields, as a busboy, on the railroads, in

packing houses, and as a machinist for Wish-
bone and Honeywell. Each of these positions
offered a unique point of view on the needs of
the worker. This gave Mr. Rojas a clear view
of the blue-collar community in Kansas City
and the ways in which the lives of workers
needed to be improved. From these experi-
ences, a desire to serve and improve the lives
of others was sparked within him.
As a U.S. Navy veteran serving in the Ko-
rean War from 1952 to 1955, Paul Rojas
joined the ranks of great men and women who
defended the United States on the frontlines.
Mr. Rojas continues to exhibit the commitment
he showed in his service to the United States
with his membership in the Korean Veterans
Association, Veterans of Underage Military
Service, and the American Legion. Within
these organizations, he advocates for those
who have served, are currently serving, and
who wish to serve their country in the future.
After serving in the Korean War, civic en-
gagement remained a pillar of Mr. Rojas’ life.
He served on various boards and commis-
sions at the city and county level before push-
ing to become the first Hispanic elected to the
Missouri General Assembly. As a State Rep-
resentative, Paul Rojas initiated national meet-
ings of Hispanic elected officials, leading to
the establishment of the National Association
of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials
(NALEO). Mr. Rojas also helped found the
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Wash-
ington DC in order to help hundreds of His-
panic and minority owned businesses network
and gain access to resources.
After his service as a Missouri State Rep-
resentative, Paul Rojas continued his devotion
to service. He is now chairmen of Guadalupe
Centers Inc., the organization that supported
his family in their time of need. Guadalupe
Centers provide training programs, education,
after school activities, and family support pro-
grams. Mr. Rojas also advocates for the wel-
fare of seniors as a member of the Kansas
City Silver Haired Council. He is also a mem-
ber of the Knights of Columbus, an organiza-
tion dedicated to charity. Recently, through
Guadalupe Centers Inc., Rojas championed
the decision to repurpose a building and cre-
ate a youth recreation center that provides
students with a safe location for extracurricular
activities and opportunities to keep them out of
trouble.
Throughout his life’s work, Paul Rojas has
served as a model of leadership and selfless-
ness. His service in the U.S. Navy, his posi-
tion as a Missouri State Representative, his
chairing of the oldest Latino serving non-profit,
Guadalupe Centers Inc., and his other leader-
ship positions demonstrate his commitment to
his community and his country. Mr. Rojas has
made a unique contribution to each of these
organizations, representing the reality of many
underrepresented communities. His counsel
empowers organizations to better make deci-
sions about how to benefit those they serve.
He continues to create a community that is
well equipped to handle the issues it faces.
It is a privilege to stand today and recognize
the contributions and devotion of Mr. Paul
Rojas. Madam Speaker, please join me in
honoring Mr. Rojas’ remarkable service to the
people of the Greater Kansas City area and
beyond.
HONORING WESTERN FARM
CENTER
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today with the Honorable
JARED HUFFMAN, to recognize Western Farm
Center as the recipient of the Sonoma County
Farm Bureau’s Friend of the Farm Bureau
award. For 52 years Western Farm Center
has been the premier feed stores that serves
farms in the Santa Rosa area.
Western Farm Center was founded by
brothers Larry and Lou Bertolini in 1967. The
store is currently owned and operated by
Lou’s daughter Maria Bertolini Frampton and
her husband Trevor Frampton, who is the gen-
eral manager of the store. Western Farm Cen-
ter has been a staple in Sonoma County for
decades. The store provides essential feed,
seed, and supplies to the surrounding rural
community, as well as exceptional customer
service.
For more than thirty years, Western Farm
Center has worked alongside the Sonoma
County Farm Bureau to bridge the rural and
urban gap by bringing chicks and ducklings to
the Farm Bureau’s Ag Days, a celebration that
introduces city children to the wonders of the
farm community. Western Farm Center has
provided straw and additional resources for
other events held by the Sonoma County
Farm Bureau.
Western Farm Center is known for being
run by people who are generous and involved
in our community. They frequently provide
food and other supplies to Pony Express, All
Aboard Dog Rescue, Sonoma County Animal
Services, and Dogwood Animal Rescue. West-
ern Farm Center played a large role in the
days and weeks following the October 2017
wildfires. Along with their vendors, the store
provided pet food, hay, and grain for cats,
dogs, and horses that had been left homeless
by the fires.
Madam Speaker, Western Farm Center is
an important business in our community and
has been aptly honored with the Sonoma
County Farm Bureau’s Friend of the Farm Bu-
reau award. It is therefore fitting and proper
that we honor the store and its owners here
today.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE JORDAN VAL-

HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize the Jordan Valley District
Library upon the occasion of its 100th Anniver-
sary. Through its trusted service, reliable staff,
and community investment, the Jordan Valley
District Library has become an indispensable
part of Northern Michigan.
Opened in July 1919 as the East Jordan
Public Library, a grant from the Carnegie Cor-
poration and an incredibly determined board of
directors and staff built the library into the
local institution it is today. Over the course of
100 years, the Jordan Valley District Library
forged its path to success while maintaining its
commitment to the community it was built
upon. While its building and name may be dif-
ferent today, the Jordan Valley District Library
still promotes the same ideals of giving the cu-
rious a place to explore and discover. The li-
brary’s 100th Anniversary will be celebrated
today, July 11th, in its original building first
constructed in 1919. Day after day, the Jordan
Valley District Library continues to set a posi-

the people of a community work together for
the common good.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late the Jordan Valley District Library and its
staff for 100 years of success, service, and
community investment. Michiganders can take
great pride in knowing the First District is
home to such dedicated citizens. On behalf of
my constituents, I wish the Jordan Valley Dis-

INTRODUCTION OF THE CIVIL WAR
DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON NA-
TIONAL HISTORICAL PARK ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill The Civil War Defenses of
Washington National Historical Park Act to
recognize and preserve the Civil War De-
fenses of Washington located in the District of
Columbia, Virginia and Maryland. The De-
fenses of Washington, including forts, un-
armed batteries and rifle trenches, created a
ring of protection for the nation’s capital during
the Civil War. This bill would redesignate the
22 Civil War Defenses of Washington currently
under National Park Service jurisdiction as a

national historical park, and allow other sites
associated with the Defenses of Washington
that are owned by the District or a unit of state
governments to be affiliated with the national
historical park through cooperative agree-
ments. This bill would also require the Sec-
retary of the Interior to facilitate the storied
history of the Civil War for both the North and
the South, including the history of the De-
fenses of Washington and the Shenandoah
Valley Campaign of 1864, being assembled;
arrayed and conveyed for the benefit of the
public for the knowledge, education and inspi-
ration of this and future generations. Last
year, I was able to have a hearing on this bill.
Although the National Park Service testified
against this bill, I feel strongly that the De-
fenses of Washington need additional recogni-
tion and should be redesignated as a national
historical park.
The Defenses of Washington were con-
structed at the beginning of the war, in 1861,
as a ring of protection for the nation’s capital
and for President Abraham Lincoln. By the
end of the war, these defenses included 68
forts, 93 unarmed batteries, 807 mounted can-
nons, 13 miles of rifle trenches and 32 miles
of military roads. The major test of the De-
fenses of Washington came with the Shen-
andoah Valley Campaign of 1864, when Con-
federate Lieutenant General Jubal Early, di-
rected by General Robert E. Lee, sought to at-
tack the nation’s capital from the north, caus-
ing Union forces threatening to attack Rich-
mond, the capital of the Confederacy, to be
withdrawn. General Early was delayed by
Union Major General Lew Wallace at the Bat-
tle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864, and was
stopped at the northern edge of Washington at
the Battle of Fort Stevens on July 11–12,
1864. The Shenandoah Valley Campaign
ended when Union Lieutenant General Philip
Sheridan defeated General Early at the Battle
of Cedar Creek, Virginia, on October 19, 1864.
Nearly all the individual forts in the De-
fenses of Washington—on both sides of the
Potomac and Anacostia rivers—were involved
in stopping General Early’s attack, and the
Battle of Fort Stevens was the second and
last attempt by the Confederate Army to attack
Washington.
Taken together, these battles were pivotal to
the outcome of the war and the freedom and
democracy that the war represented for this
country. It is therefore fitting that we recognize
these sites by redesignating them as a na-
tional historical park.
I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

IN HONOR OF THE HOUSING AU-
THORITY OF THE CITY OF MIL-
WAUKEE
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Hous-
ing Authority of the City of Milwaukee (HACM).
State Statute and then Common Council
Resolution established the Housing Authority
of the City of Milwaukee, on May 1, 1944, to
address the need for affordable housing in Mil-
waukee.
Entering its 75th year, the Housing Authority
of the City of Milwaukee provides affordable
housing to almost 11,000 households in the
City of Milwaukee through its public and af-
fordable housing programs and Housing
Choice Voucher program. Its mission is to fos-
ter strong, resilient, and inclusive communities
by providing a continuum of high-quality hous-
ing options that support self-sufficiency, good
quality of life, and the opportunity to thrive.
During the past 75 years, the Housing Au-
thority of the City of Milwaukee has provided
stable affordable housing to thousands of fam-
ilies, seniors, persons with disabilities, and
veterans. They first accomplished this by ac-
quiring a city-built, WPA-assisted develop-
ment, and subsequently by creating almost a
thousand units of housing for veterans and
building other innovative developments; includ-
ing the first high-rise designated specifically
for the elderly and one of the first housing au-
thorities to develop public housing single-fam-
ily homes.
The Housing Authority of the City of Mil-
waukee works with its residents to provide
them a pathway to self-sufficiency through its
many initiatives and collaborations in areas
such as public safety, accessibility, job training
and workforce development, educational sup-
port, energy efficiency, financial literacy, envi-
ronmental stewardship, household savings
and homeownership.
It has done this as a national leader in cre-
ating healthy, safe, vibrant, transit-oriented,
sustainable, mixed-income communities of
choice. They have transformed neighborhoods
and continue to be innovative in their methods
and services, as well as flexible in responding
to the affordable housing needs in Milwaukee.
The Housing Authority of the City of Mil-
waukee is a strong supporter of Emerging
Business Enterprises, with over $20 million
dollars annually in contracts supporting minor-
ity and women-owned enterprises
The Housing Authority of the City of Mil-
waukee has partnered with multiple federal
agencies to bring housing and services to its
residents and has been awarded multiple fed-
eral competitive grants, resulting in new and
revitalized developments, including the very
first completion of a HOPE VI grant from the
Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment.
The Housing Authority of the City of Mil-
waukee has been recognized locally, nation-
ally, and even internationally with dozens of
awards for both its buildings and its services
from organizations such as the American
Planning Association, U.S. Green Building
Council, Governor’s Council on Financial Lit-
eracy, the Ash Center for Democratic Govern-
ance and Innovation at Harvard University,
Congress for New Urbanism, the State &
Local Energy Report, The Environmental Pro-
tection Agency’s Sustainable Communities
Program, Wisconsin Department of Public In-
struction, National League of Cities and the Si-
erra Club.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons I am
pleased to honor the Housing Authority of the
City of Milwaukee. This agency continues to
be an innovative leader in affordable housing
and makes the 4th Congressional District a
better place to live and work.

Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and recognize the late Michelle Langer,
who was senselessly murdered in the Virginia
Beach Municipal Center shooting. Virginia
Beach lost Michelle far too soon.
For 12 years, Michelle, also known as
Missy, was a faithful administrative assistant
for the Department of Public Utilities for the
City of Virginia Beach. She had plans to retire
soon. An Ohio native, Missy’s heart was
drawn to Virginia Beach and she decided to
call it home. Missy’s life of hard work and
service to the community will forever be re-

Missy will be missed by all her loved ones.
Hampton Roads significantly benefited from
her presence; she made our community a bet-

IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIRE-
MENT OF DEARBORN POLICE
CORPORAL GORDON MORSE
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Police Corporal Gordon
Morse for his many years of service to the
Dearborn Police Department. Corporal Morse
recently retired after twenty-five years of ex-
emplary work with the department.
Corporal Morse began his service at the
Dearborn Police Department in 1993. In 2002,
he was selected to be a K–9 Officer. During
his tenure, he has served in a variety of roles
including as a field training officer, a range of-
ficer, explorer advisor, and department chap-
lain. Corporal Morse has represented his de-
partment by engaging in significant outreach
to the Dearborn community through school
and church demonstrations. He has also
served as an instructor for the Oakland Police
Academy K–9 Training Center for fifteen
years. In this role, he trained numerous police
officers and has created a safer environment
for everyone in the Dearborn community.
Corporal Morse served the Dearborn com-
munity in various roles for a total of twenty-five
years. His commitment to protecting the Dear-
born community has impacted hundreds of his
fellow officers and residents. His work training
officers has been crucial to the continued
safety of Dearborn, and his outreach efforts
have strengthened the relationship between
his department and the community. His exem-
plary service stands as a role model of the
dedication, sacrifice, and commitment of our
police officers. His dedicated leadership will be
missed, but we wish him good health and
every happiness in his retirement years.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the twenty-five years of service
of Police Corporal Gordon Morse to his coun-
try and to the Dearborn, Michigan community.
His commitment to public safety is worthy of
commendation.

CONGRATULATING SHANE
JOHNSON FOR HIS SERVICE
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to offer my appreciation and commendation to
Shane Johnson who will be leaving the De-
partment of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy
after thirty years of service and success.
When you have the honor of representing
Idaho’s Second Congressional District and the
Idaho National Laboratory, you learn a lot
about nuclear energy and the important role
the federal government plays researching, de-
veloping and deploying this amazing tech-
nology. Another part of that education is col-
laborating with the people at the Department
of Energy who oversee the labs and these
programs. It is in that capacity that I was able
to see Shane Johnson lead the Office of Nu-
clear Energy on multiple occasions with ex-
treme professionalism and vision.
If you go back and look at the major pro-
grams and accomplishments of the DOE Of-
fice of Nuclear Energy, you will see Shane
Johnson’s fingerprints all over the place.
When DOE helped industry get two advanced
light water reactor designs licensed by the Nu-
clear Regulatory Commission, Shane was
there; when DOE worked with industry to get
the first small modular reactors ready for de-
ployment, in Idaho, Shane was there; when
the Office of Nuclear Energy set up a robust
university program to educate and graduate
the next generation of nuclear scientists and
engineers, Shane was there; when the Office
of Nuclear Energy made its labs and facilities
available to industry and universities to sup-
port technology development, Shane was
there; and, when the Office of Nuclear Energy
and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
began working together to use lab developed
codes to enhance reactor safety and security,
Shane was there again. At the end of the day,
when you look at Shane’s career and you see
significant impacts and lasting contributions. A
‘‘thank you,’’ and a ‘‘job well done is de-
served.’’
While Shane’s accomplishments are real
and impactful, his leadership of the Office of
Nuclear Energy and his stewardship of the
Idaho National Laboratory deserve special rec-
ognition. As administrations and initiatives
come and go, it is the enduring leadership of
the federal staff that keep our government op-
erating. In his career at the Office of Nuclear
Energy, incoming administrations have asked
Shane to lead the office and the staff to keep
our fundamental goals and objectives in sight.
Shane excelled in this role and when he came
before my Energy and Water Appropriations
Subcommittee, you could see the confidence
and pride his colleagues had in his leadership.
As he leaves federal service, I want to thank
Shane for his outstanding contribution at the
Office of Nuclear Energy and wish him and his
wife, Susan, all the best in the future. His
service will benefit generations of Americans
to come.

Richard worked as an engineer for the De-

IN MEMORY OF DR. WRIGHT L.
LASSITER, JR.
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to the
distinguished life and legacy of Dr. Wright L.
Lassiter, Jr., who passed away on Monday,
July 1, 2019. Dr. Lassiter was known through-
out the Dallas community for his wisdom as
an educator, his leadership as a businessman,
and his selflessness as a volunteer.
Dr. Lassiter served in the higher education
system for an impressive thirty-plus years. His
positions included President of Schenectady
County Community College, President of
Bishop College, President of El Centro Com-
munity College, and most recently Chancellor
of the Dallas County Community College Dis-
trict, the largest community college system in
Texas. He was also a Distinguished Adjunct
Professor of Leadership Studies and Manage-
ment/Ethics at Dallas Baptist University, a
Master Professor in the Educational Leader-
ship Program at the University of Texas, and
a Visiting Professor at Texas A&M University.
Dr. Lassiter had a passion for higher edu-
cation and made it a priority of his to ensure
that underrepresented students had equal ac-
cess to it.
In addition to his career as an educator and
administrator, Dr. Lassiter earned national rec-
ognition for his diversity and inclusion advo-
cacy. He held presidential appointments to the
White House Commission on Minority Busi-
ness Development and the National Advisory
Council to the National Endowment for the Hu-
manities under Presidents George H.W. Bush
and George W. Bush, respectively. He also
held an appointment from former Texas Gov-
ernor Rick Perry to the Task Force to Develop
the State Higher Education Plan.
Dr. Lassiter was recognized for his work as
the first African American recipient of the Rus-
sell Perry Distinguished Leadership Award by
Dallas Baptist University, the Distinguished
Service Award by the Dallas-Fort Worth Hos-
pital Council, and the Jubilee History—Maker
Award. He also published thirteen books and
collections of speeches and sermons.
Outside of his professional life, Dr. Lassiter
lent his free time to our community. He was a
board member of the Dallas Salvation Army,
United Way, the University of Texas South-
western Medical Center Foundation, and the
Dallas Housing Authority, to name a few. His
contributions to the Dallas area are truly im-
measurable, and his work will have a lasting-
impact on our community.
Dr. Lassiter is survived by his wife
Demetria; son Wright Lassiter III; daughter
Michele LassiterEwell; and two grand-
daughters, Ryan and Loren.
I ask my colleagues to join me in remem-
bering Dr. Lassiter and his contributions
through public service, his dedication to his
students, and his love for the Dallas commu-
nity. We will miss him dearly.

HONORING THE BERETTA FAMILY
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today with the Honorable Jared
Huffman to honor the Beretta Family as the
recipient of the 2019 Sonoma County Farm
Bureau Luther Burbank Conservation Award,
which recognizes an individual, business, or
family that is committed to environmental
stewardship. The Beretta Family Dairy has be-
come increasingly environmentally friendly
over the last 70 years.
The Beretta Family started focusing on their
farm’s impact on the environment in the
1950s. They stopped using chemical fer-
tilizers, focused on pasture management, and
committed to growing as much of their own
feed as possible to reduce the amount of food
that had to be trucked long distances. They
currently produce 60 percent of the feed re-
quired for their 350 dairy cows, which not only
helps the environment, but reduces the cost of
feed as well. Starting in 1981, the Beretta fam-
ily has used recycled water from the City of
Santa Rosa to water the hay and silage on
their 200 acres. By using recycled water, the
family is conserving the groundwater in the
aquifer underneath the Santa Rosa Plains. In
1992, the Beretta Family developed their

fertigation system which combined the cows’
manure with the recycled city water and kept
the manure from contaminating waterways.
After they started using this system, their crop
yields increased by one ton per acre. The Be-
retta Family Dairy was one of the first farms
to collaborate with the City of Santa Rosa and
the Sonoma Resource Conservation District
on a nutrient offset project. The Beretta Family
has hosted students from the Sonoma Re-
source Conservation District’s FARMS (Farm-
ing, Agriculture, and Resource Management
for Sustainability) Leadership program. They
have provided opportunities to students that
otherwise may not get to experience a working
dairy.
The Beretta Family Ranch is currently oper-
ated by Doug and Sharon Beretta and their
children Jennifer, Lisa, and Ryan. Lisa’s son
Brayden has shown an affinity for agriculture
and may be the fifth generation of the Beretta
Family to continue the family dairy business.
In 2015, Doug Beretta, and the whole Beretta
Family, were given the Water Quality Steward-
ship Award by the North Coast Water Quality
Control Board in recognition of the family’s
management of water and resources on their
dairy. Doug Beretta is the current Director and
past President of the Sonoma County Farm
Bureau and the Sonoma County Fair and is a
member of the 4H Replacement Heifer Com-
mittee and the Youth AG and Leadership
Foundation.
Madam Speaker, the Beretta Family is dedi-
cated to environmental stewardship and has
worked to make their dairy environmentally
friendly over the last 70 years. It is therefore
fitting and proper that we honor them here
today.

RECOGNITION OF MRIGLOBAL’S
75TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the 75th anniversary of
MRIGlobal in Kansas City, Missouri.
As World War II was ending, Americans
were in awe of technology’s role in ending the
greatest global struggle in history. The quality
of American science turned the tide of the
war.
In order to harness further scientific ad-
vancements, create amazing new tech-
nologies, and employ returning veterans, Kan-
sas City civic leadership founded MRIGlobal,
an independent, not-for-profit research organi-
zation.
I am thankful that those civic leaders had
the vision to create MRIGlobal and am
pleased that Kansas City has remained its
home.
Through the years, MRIGlobal has attracted
top scientific talent, worked across disparate
specialties, and addressed some of the
world’s most challenging problems. Their re-
search and development have impacted a
wide array of endeavors including: defense; in-
fectious disease and biological threat detec-
tion; human health; pharmaceutical science;
energy, in-vitro diagnostics; global health; and
transportation.
MRIGlobal brings a significant share of Fed-
eral Research and Development investment to
the Kansas City region. Since 2013,
MRIGlobal has been awarded more than $495
million in applied R&D grants. Furthermore,
MRIGlobal employs 288 dedicated individuals
between its Plaza and North Kansas City cam-
puses and 416 people nationwide.
MRIGlobal is a strong and active corporate
citizen. They partner with regional Missouri
and Kansas Universities and Colleges to de-
velop scientific talent and secure qualified em-
ployees. MRIGlobal has been and remains
one of the strongest supporters of Kansas
City’s science, technology, engineering and
math education programs. For example, it
proudly serves as the Presenting Sponsor for
the Greater Kansas City Science and Engi-
neering Fair. MRIGlobal is also a key civic
contributor, supporting such organizations as
BioNexus KC, The Civic Council of Greater
Kansas City, KC Chamber of Commerce, Kan-
sas City Area Development Council, Union
Station Kansas City, the Nelson-Atkins Mu-
seum Business Council, the Animal Health
Corridor, and the National World War I Mu-
seum.
Madam Speaker, I am honored to represent
the employees of great non-profit companies
like MRIGlobal. I ask my colleagues in the
United States House of Representatives to
join me in congratulating MRIGlobal on 75
years of progress and wishing them continued
growth and success in the years ahead.

INTRODUCTION OF RESOLUTION
SUPPORTING THE NORTHERN

HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, as the
United States faces a humanitarian crisis at its
southern border, we must reaffirm and restore
our commitment to provide aid to our southern
neighbors in the Northern Triangle.
We must recognize the impact of U.S. sup-
port in reducing corruption, crime, and drug
trafficking in Guatemala, El Salvador, and
Honduras. The resolution also recognizes that
U.S. aid has spurred economic development
and job growth in the Northern Triangle. Cut-
ting funding for various preventative programs
is not the answer.
Cutting foreign aid will undo the progress
that has been made within the region and will
make the root causes of migration greater,
which in tum will force even more individuals
to flee their home country. We must ensure
that the United States remains committed to
helping individuals in need.

I rise today to commemorate the successful
career of Dr. Judy Lynn Genshaft. After 19
years of service as President of the University
of South Florida, Dr. Genshaft has retired.
Under her leadership, USP has become a
world-class institution of learning.
During Dr. Genshaft’s tenure as President,
she established the University of South Florida
as one of the nation’s top research univer-
sities. It now ranks ninth in size and is formally
recognized as ‘‘top-tier’’ by the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
Dr. Genshaft also raised the caliber of study at
USF by creating the Honors College in 2002,
which has flourished under her guidance. Ear-
lier this year, Dr. Genshaft and her husband
donated $20 million of their own money to the
Honors College—a generous gift that rep-
resents only a fraction of the care she has
given the University over the last two decades.
Her dedication to the University and the
Tampa Bay area earned her the title of the
2008 Tampa Bay Business Journal Business
Woman of the Year and an induction into the
Tampa Bay Business Hall of Fame.
Dr. Genshaft’s unwavering commitment will
have a profound impact on generations of stu-
dents and Floridians to come. I thank her for
everything she has done for the University of
South Florida, our region and our state. Sandy
and I wish her well and congratulate her on
her wonderful career.

CARE ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2019

Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today
I am pleased to introduce the Primary Care
Enhancement Act of 2019, which would open
up more access to affordable primary care.
Direct Primary Care (DPC) is a member-
ship-based alternative payment model for pri-
mary care in which patients, employers, or
health plans pay a DPC physician practice
monthly or periodic fees directly for unlimited
access to primary care and prevention serv-
ices. DPC affords the patient more time with

the doctor—sometimes an hour per visit—giv-
ing the doctor the time to build a true relation-
ship with their patients, so they can better un-
derstand and address their health needs.
Today, DPC is providing high-quality care at
lower cost for individuals of all ages and in-
comes across America. By partnering with
wrap-around insurance plans that cover non-
primary care services, DPC practices now
serve patients with private insurance, Medi-
care Advantage, and Medicaid managed care.
As opposed to ‘‘concierge’’ physician prac-
tices, DPC practices typically charge a low
monthly fee of $50–$100 per month and serve
low and moderate-income patients. However,
IRS interpretation of the tax code prevents
Americans with Health Savings Accounts
(HSAs) from using this promising alternative
payment model.
The Primary Care Enhancement Act clarifies
two small provisions in the Internal Revenue
Code that treat these innovative primary care
arrangements for employees and individuals
as health plans rather than medical services.
More than twenty states have passed laws de-
fining DPC as a medical service and not a
health plan regulated by state insurance law.
Likewise, Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) rules on Essential Health Ben-
efits clearly state that DPC arrangements are
medical services, not health insurance. How-
ever, the current IRS interpretation of the stat-
ute prohibits individuals with HSAs from fund-
ing their accounts if they have a DPC arrange-
ment. Furthermore, individuals cannot use
their existing HSA dollars to pay for the
monthly or annual DPC fees as qualified med-
ical expenses, even though the fees are giving
them access to their primary care doctor and
primary care services that would otherwise be
HSA-eligible.
As more individuals and employers seek to
utilize the DPC delivery model, it is important
that an outdated tax barrier not get in the way
of patients accessing this successful model of
care.
While many of us have philosophical dif-
ferences about HSAs and their role in health
care, my legislation is not an expansion of
HSAs themselves; rather, it is a narrow clari-
fication providing tax equity for individuals who
want to use DPC arrangements. I urge my col-
leagues support this bipartisan effort to ex-
pand access and continue the movement to-
wards better primary care at lower costs.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH
ANNIVERSARY OF STEMME FARMS
HON. ANN WAGNER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I am
proud to congratulate Warren Stemme and his
family on the 150th anniversary of their farm
in Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District.
Founded in 1869, Stemme Farms has be-
come a landmark in St. Louis County, helping
develop the community while playing an inte-
gral role in Missouri agriculture over the past
century and a half.
One of the few full-time operations in the
area, the 1,100-acre corn and soybean farm
embraces the latest in agricultural technology,
providing an indispensable source of edu-
cation for school groups, advocates, and elect-
ed officials alike.
A fourth-generation farmer, representative of
the St. Louis County Farm Bureau, and former
president of the Missouri Soybean Associa-
tion, Mr. Stemme is one of the premier farm-
ers and agricultural advocates statewide.
It is my honor to recognize and congratulate
Stemme Farms for providing the St. Louis
community with nutrition, economic develop-
ment, technological insights, and breathtaking
scenery for the past 150 years.

Tara was a hardworking engineer who
worked to educate the community about clean
water. She served the Department of Public

years and contributed significantly to the mis-
sion of improving the water quality of the Lake
James Watershed. Tara’s life of hard work
and service to the community will forever be
remembered.
Tara will be missed by all her loved ones.
Hampton Roads significantly benefited from
her presence; she made our community a bet-
ter place. Today we remember and honor her

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND
WORK OF FRANCIS ‘‘FRAN’’
JOHNSON
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing Francis ‘‘Fran’’ Johnson for
her commitment to community service in the
District of Columbia on the occasion of her
70th birthday on July 23, 2019.
Johnson is a third-generation District native.
She began her service to the District as a
candy-striper at Howard University Hospital,
formerly known as Freedman’s Hospital, in
1964. Over the years, she has advocated for
critical issues such as equality in education
and housing and improved financial literacy,
among others.
As a neighborhood advocate, she has in-
creased the number of signs in the community
to help children with hearing impairments and
called for more lighting in her neighborhood to
help reduce crime. She fights for a D.C. with
clean streets, safe neighborhoods and flour-
ishing communities.
Building on her experience as a Ward 4
resident, she cofounded a non-profit named
Shammah, Inc, which provides low-income
families with food, shelter and the opportunity
to learn life skills.
Over the years, she has been recognized
for her commitment to service. In 2009, she
was named ‘‘Superwoman’’ by NBC News 4,
and in 2017, she was crowned Ms. Senior
District of Columbia. As Ms. Senior District of
Columbia, she attended over 200 community
events, amplifying the voice of older D.C. resi-
dents and advocating for an age-friendly D.C.
In her role as Ms. Senior District of Columbia,
she testified at D.C. Council hearings and
partnered with several D.C. Office on Aging
and Community Living programs.
Johnson attended St. Cecilia’s Academy
and D.C.’s first land-grant college, the Wash-
ington Technical Institute. She graduated with
academic honors and a degree in Business
Administration/Secretarial Science.
She began her professional career in 1970,
as the first African-American legal secretary
for the International Business Machines Cor-
poration’s (IBM) intellectual property division.
After 30 years at IBM, she retired and joined
the Business Executives for National Service
as the office receptionist and Assistant to the
CFO.
While she has embraced many roles during
her lifetime—wife, daughter, mother, grand-
mother, professional and community advo-
cate—Johnson still makes time for sports,
music, traveling and many other hobbies.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing Francis ‘‘Fran’’ Johnson on
the occasion of her 70th birthday and for her
lasting contributions to the District of Colum-
bia.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN GIUMARRA, JR.
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of John G. Giumarra,
Jr., who passed away on June 30, 2019 at the
age of 78. John was a well-respected busi-
nessman not only in Kern County, but
throughout California.
Born to a family that had been growing
grapes in California since 1922, John joined
the family business at an early age. John
earned his bachelor’s degree from University
of California, Berkeley, and went on to earn
his Juris Doctor from Stanford Law, working
as the Book Review Editor of the Stanford
Law Review. He initially moved to Newport
Beach to work for a law firm, but the family
business quickly drew him back to Bakersfield.
There, John applied his legal acumen in as-
sisting his father with the company that bears
their family name—Giumarra Vineyards. Work-
ing as the in-house counsel, John played a
critical role in developing contracts with other
businesses, as well as playing a lead role in
working with U.S. and foreign government offi-
cials to expand American grape exports.
For years, John worked tirelessly, embrac-
ing an increasingly important role as the face
of his family business. Through his dedication,
John transformed Giumarra Vineyards into an
internationally-known brand. A pioneer in viti-
culture, John imported Chilean grapes in the
1980’s for use in Giumarra Vineyards products
during the off season in the U.S., a move that
bolstered the company’s market share and
served to enhance its rapidly-growing footprint.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E904 July 11, 2019
In 2015, John became President of Giumarra
Vineyards.
John was also extremely active in the grape
industry; for 33 years, John served as both the
Chairman of the Board of Directors and the
Executive Chairman of the California Table
Grape Commission. He served as the Chair-
man of the Board of Directors of the California
Grape and Tree Fruit League, as well as on
the Board of Directors of both the United
Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association and the
Produce Marketing Association.
In addition to his dedication to leading and
growing the grape industry, John was also
committed to raising money for education,
serving as the Chairman of the annual Cali-
fornia State University, Bakersfield Athletics
Spring BBQ, raising millions of dollars since
he was named chairman back in 1972.
Those who knew John will fondly remember
him as a great mentor, a consummate profes-
sional, tireless advocate for the grape industry,
and a dedicated family man. I am proud to
have known him and been able to call John a
friend. I will miss his counsel and sage advice
on the important issues facing the grape in-
dustry and agriculture in our community, state,
and across the country.
John is survived by his wife, Pamela, his
five children, John III, Randy and his wife
Barri, Juliana and her husband Clayton, Jo-
seph, Jillian and her husband Morgan, and his
15 grandchildren. On behalf of Kern County
and the 23rd Congressional District of Cali-
fornia, I want to extend my condolences to the
entire Giumarra family. John will be missed,
but he leaves behind a legacy that will con-
tinue to serve as an inspiration and shape an
industry for years to come.

PROMOTION OF ECZEMA
AWARENESS
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise to promote awareness of a
skin condition for which we have not found a
medical cure. Eczema.
Eczema is a skin condition that causes red,
itchy and inflamed skin and has profound
medical, psychological, and economic impact
on patients, families, and their communities.
The prevalence of Eczema in the United
States is 10.1 percent and Eczema impacts
over 31.6 million children and adults in the
United States alone. Patients afflicted with Ec-
zema experience dry cracked and scaly skin,
incessant itch, chronic pain and sleep depriva-
tion. 41.5 percent of adult Eczema patients re-
port having a concurring diagnosis of depres-
sion and 47.1 percent report having a concur-
ring diagnosis of asthma. Adults and children
with Eczema frequently also experience
comorbidities like asthma, allergic rhinitis, food
allergies, ADHD, bacterial and viral infections
and hypertension. Eczema disease burdens
also includes anxiety, stress on social and inti-
mate relationships, increased suicidal ideation
delayed developmental achievement, reduced
self-esteem, restrictions on diet and exercise,
extensive caregiver burdens, challenges with
medical adherence and missed school days.
Eczema sufferers miss days at work, disability,
unemployment and under-employment and
other opportunity costs.
The direct medical cost of the three most
common types of Eczema exceed $2.17 billion
and the indirect medical cost exceed $927 mil-
lion and two thirds of Eczema patients report
experiencing significant barriers including high
out-of-pocket costs and insurance require-
ments that delay patients access to medica-
tions.
There is no cure for Eczema, but emerging
technologies and medications promise a much
brighter future for Eczema patients. Eczema is
a serious health problem and we can’t stop
until we find a cure.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. WAYNE
MORRISON
HON. RICK LARSEN
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today with my colleague Representa-
tive LAHOOD to honor Wayne Morrison, Spe-
cialist in International Trade and Finance in
the Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade Divi-
sion of the Congressional Research Service
(CRS).
Wayne recently retired after 36 years of dis-
tinguished service at CRS as a leading expert
on U.S.-China trade and economic relations.
Wayne has always been helpful to our of-
fices and willing to speak to groups, Members
and policy staffers about trade and China.
Before starting his career at CRS, Wayne
worked in the office of Senator John Heinz,
engaging directly with constituents on inter-
national trade issues.
From there, Wayne has spent over three
decades working in trade policy. Wayne has
been involved in nearly every major trade bill
and U.S. trade law, as well as U.S. trade rela-
tions and negotiations with key U.S. trading
partners and at the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
As the Chairs of the US-China Working
Group, we rise with appreciation for Wayne’s
work on China specifically. Wayne’s knowl-
edge of China’s economy and its economic
rise have been critical to Congress. One of
Wayne’s greatest strengths is his ability to ex-
plain the complexities of the bilateral relation-
ship in an authoritative yet accessible manner,
providing invaluable assistance to Members of
Congress, as well as to the most experienced
congressional staff and to those just starting to
work on China.
Wayne represents CRS at its finest in serv-
ing Congress. We will miss him and wish him
the very best in his retirement.

HONORING THE PORT CHICAGO 50
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Port Chicago 50.
In 1944, a cargo vessel exploded at the Port
Chicago Naval Magazine, located in my dis-
trict, resulting in the deadliest home front dis-
aster of World War II. The men loading ammu-
nition at the site were African American. When
the surviving African American 258 sailors un-
derstandably refused to return to those unsafe
conditions, 50 were discriminately charged
with and convicted of mutiny.
Congress and the Administration have re-
peatedly recognized the injustice the Port Chi-
cago 50 suffered. Congress directed the cre-
ation of a memorial, the Executive branch par-
doned one of the 50, and then-Secretary of
the Navy Ray Mabus recognized the ‘‘well-
documented challenges associated with uni-
formed service by African Americans during
that era’’ and said he ‘‘strongly support[s] ex-
ecutive action in favor of’’ the Port Chicago
50.
An amendment I filed to the National De-
fense Authorization Act (H.R. 2500) calls for
the Navy to exonerate them, a process used
in prior NDAAs for wrongfully convicted serv-
ice members.
As we near the 75th anniversary of the ex-
plosion, let us follow President Obama’s Port
Chicago tribute: ‘‘may we carry forward their
legacy by renewing our resolve to tackle injus-
tice in our time.’’
I would like to particularly thank the Friends
of Port Chicago, including Reverend Diana
McDaniel, Professor John Lawrence at the
University of California Washington Center,
former Congressman George Miller, and Con-
gresswoman BARBARA LEE for all of their work
and support for this cause.
I am grateful to my colleagues for their sup-
port of this amendment and look forward to
working with our colleagues in the Senate to
ensure this important provision remains in the
bill that is ultimately signed into law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E905
July 11, 2019
Elden Charles Justus who died in the line of
duty during the Korean War on December 6,
1950, and is being laid to rest today.
Elden Justus was born in Grady, New Mex-
ico, to Elmer and Lois Justus. The family set-
tled in Arcata, California, where Elden grad-
uated high school in 1945. On October 29,
1945 he enlisted in the United States Army
and joined the 33rd Field Artillery Unit in
Darmstadt, Germany. He met his wife in Ger-
many, Ruth Boensel, and had two children,
Jack and Lois.
The family relocated to Camp Carson in
Colorado in January of 1950, and by Sep-
tember of 1950, Sergeant Justus departed for
Japan and then to Korea. He served in the
Headquarters Battery, 57th Field Artillery, 7th
Infantry Division. He died in what is now North
Korea on December 6, 1950, while assisting
American and Korean soldiers out of an
enemy attack. He was considered Missing in
Action (MIA) until his remains were found in
2004 in a communal grave.
The Department of the Army POW/MIA Ac-
counting Agency performed multiple tests and
after 15 years of verification work, Sergeant
Justus’s surviving family members, his chil-
dren Jack and Lois, were notified that their fa-
ther’s remains were found and identified in
April 2019.
Sergeant Justus will posthumously be
awarded the Purple Heart, Army Good Con-
duct Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Na-
tional Defense Service Medal, Korean Service
Medal with two Bronze Service Stars, Presi-
dential Unit Citation-Navy, United Nations
Service Medal, Republic of Korea-Korean War
Service Medal, and the Republic of Korea-
Presidential Unit Citation.
Madam Speaker, until Sergeant Justus’s re-
mains were recovered in 2004, he was one of
over 7,000 Korean War service members who
remain unaccounted. Sergeant Justus made
the brave and honorable decision to help his
fellow soldiers to safety when he gave his life
for this nation. Therefore, please join me in
recognizing SFC Elden Justus as he finally re-
turns home and is laid to rest.

IN RECOGNITION OF MIGUEL
GONZALEZ
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Miguel Gonzalez for his hard work and
dedication to serving my local community. Mr.
Gonzalez, the Co-President of the Northgate
Gonzalez Market chain, serves as an excellent
example of how one family’s achievement of
the American Dream can impact a community.
In 1968, Mr. Gonzalez and his family immi-
grated to the United States. In the beginning,
Miguel Gonzalez worked in manufacturing and
retail enterprises. With his family, Mr. Gon-
zalez shaped the creation of a market that
would provide other immigrants with food and
products from their native regions in Mexico.
The Gonzalez family faced the challenge of
learning how to establish a retail food busi-
ness in a new country. With a vision and an
urge to serve their community, the first
Northgate Market opened its doors in 1980 in
Anaheim, California. Through commitment,
perseverance, and involvement in their neigh-
borhood, the Northgate Markets began to
grow and flourish.
While working with other family members
and Northgate executives, Mr. Gonzalez di-
rected the physical growth of the chain and
oversaw major developments in purchasing,
information technology, human resources and
other elements of the business. Miguel Gon-
zalez is also a founding member of the Board
of Directors of Northgate Gonzalez Real Es-
tate, LLC.
Following in their father’s footsteps, Mr.
Gonzalez’s six children continue to contribute
and expand upon their father’s business, while
investing themselves in their community.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring
Miguel Gonzalez for his commitment to serv-
ing his community and inspiring younger gen-
erations in their pursuit of the American
Dream.

honor and recognize the late Ryan Keith Cox,
who was senselessly murdered in the Virginia
Beach Municipal Center shooting. He dis-
played a heroic and selfless act right before
his death. Virginia Beach lost this hero far too
soon.
For 12 years, Cox, known as Keith, worked
as an account clerk in the Department of Pub-
lic Utilities for the City of Virginia Beach. Keith,
during the horrific shooting, led several individ-
uals to safety and barricaded them in a secure
room. After ensuring those individuals were
safe, Keith bravely reentered the line of fire to
find more individuals to carry to safety, which
then lead to his death. Keith did not think
about himself in the midst of danger, but in-
stead thought about how to protect and save
others.
Friends described Keith as someone who
would sacrifice for others. Keith’s life of hard
work and service to the community, as well as
his sacrificial and heroic acts, will forever be
remembered.
Keith will be missed by all his loved ones.
Hampton Roads significantly benefited from
his presence; he made our community a better

COMMENDING LOGAN SIMMONS’
HEROIC ACTIONS
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA

Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to commend 19-year-old Logan
Simmons for his altruistic and quick response
to a choking customer while working at Chick-
fil-A in Flowery Branch, Georgia.
On June 25, 2019, Simmons, who is a man-
ager at the restaurant, was working the drive-
thru when he noticed a pause in the flow of
cars. After being notified by a customer that a
young boy in the next car was choking, Sim-
mons did not hesitate to jump out of the serv-
ice window and run to rescue the young boy.
Simmons ran up to the car and quickly no-
ticed the 6-year-old boy’s seatbelt was tangled
around his neck. Simmons quickly approached
the boy and his mother, noticing that the boy
had started losing color in his face. After ask-
ing the mother for her permission to approach
the boy with a pocket knife, he swiftly cut
through the seat belt, saving the young boy’s
life.
The mother and her son had left the loca-
tion by the time Simmons had made it back to
the drive-thru window, but she was sure to call
shortly after the incident and send a letter
thanking Simmons for saving her son’s life.
Unexpected acts of heroism often make the
biggest difference, and Simmons sure is a
local hero in the city of Flowery Branch. I
would like to personally thank him for stepping
up and saving a life. Because of his swift call
to action, this young boy is alive today.

INTRODUCTION OF THE CHRONIC
DISEASE MANAGEMENT ACT OF
2019
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today
I am pleased to introduce the Chronic Disease
Management Act of 2019, which would permit
high-deductible health plans to provide chronic
disease prevention services to plan enrollees
prior to satisfying their plan deductible.
According to a 2017 Rand Corporation
study, 90 percent of the United States’ $3.3
trillion in annual health expenditures are for
people with chronic and mental health condi-
tions. Approximately 60 percent of the cost is
paid by public sources: Medicare, Medicaid,
and other U.S. federal and state health pro-
grams. The Partnership to Fight Chronic Dis-
ease estimates that by 2030, 83 million people
in the U.S. will have three or more chronic
health conditions, up from 31 million in 2015.
Preventing chronic diseases, or managing
symptoms when prevention is not possible,
can reduce these costs.
Currently, the cost of chronic care services
often prevents individuals who have a chronic
disease and high deductible health plan from
seeking care. Many Americans struggle, par-
ticularly at the beginning of the year, when
they have to pay out of pocket until they have
met their deductible.
My legislation would address this problem
by allowing health savings account eligible
high deductible health plans to provide bene-
ficiary coverage of chronic disease manage-
ment care before reaching their deductible
limit. My bill would lower costs for people liv-
ing with chronic conditions by providing pre-
deductible coverage of services critical in
fending off the progression of chronic illness.
That is why I am proud to sponsor the Chronic
Disease Management Act of 2019, and I urge
all of my colleagues to join me in support of
this important piece of legislation.

E906 July 11, 2019
SHERM OLSRUD
HON. GREG WALDEN
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I would like
to recognize and commend Mr. Sherm Olsrud
for his extensive community service and phi-
lanthropy efforts in Rogue Valley and the rest
of the southern Oregon region over the last 40
years. Sherm passed away in May at the age
of 95, survived by his wife, Wanda, and their
children. Today, I’d like to pay tribute to
Sherm’s service to our nation and his commit-
ment and generosity to Oregonians in need.
Sherm’s sense of duty and service began
early in life when he left North Dakota to serve
as a United States Marine in the South Pacific
during World War II. Following the war, Sherm
settled in Eugene, Oregon and met his wife-to-
be, Wanda, while working in his Uncle’s res-
taurant. They immediately fell in love and were
happily married in February 1947.
Over the next decade, the couple’s love and
ambition would bring them great success.
Sherm used his GI Bill benefits to train as a
meat cutting apprentice and in 1958 he and
Wanda would buy Wilson’s Sausage Kitchen
establishing their first family business in Eu-
gene. After several years of building their
small business they opened Eugene’s first all-
day market in a new 10,000 square foot gro-
cery store named Sherm’s 24 Hour Market.
With the resourcefulness, adaptability, and
integrity of a United States Marine he kept
Sherm’s running successfully for nearly ten
more years before selling the business in
order to expand his business throughout the
southern Oregon. Sherm and Wanda built a
family store chain purchasing the old Thunder-
bird Market in Medford in 1967, the Mayfair
Market in Klamath Falls in 1974, the Bazaar
department store in Medford in 1977, the Food
4 Less franchise in 1985, and Food World in
Roseburg in 2000. They often worked more
than 12 hours every day of the week to main-
tain their vision while employing more than
600 people. Sherm would also say ‘‘the cus-
tomer is still the boss, always has been and
always will be because the customer has a lot
of options.’’
Although his business accomplishments
demonstrate a record of success, none of it
would have been possible without the distin-
guished character and value system of the
man himself. Sherm believed in sharing the
fruits of his success with those less fortunate
in the community by supporting programs to
help them get back on their feet. For instance,
every year Sherm and Wanda donated nearly
50,000 pounds of food and toiletry items to the
Jackson County ACCESS community assist-
ance program.
Sherm has also supported fun educational
programs for local children and young adults.
Sherm and Wanda generously donated to
local programs like Future Farmers of Amer-
ica, 4H Club, and Kids Unlimited, as well
maintaining Bear Creek Park, building a
$20,000 fence for McLoughlin Middle School,
and covering ticket costs for all children twelve
and under for the Jackson County Fair. Even
upon receiving a share of a winning Powerball
ticket he sold, he quickly donated the funds to
two local elementary schools. Well known as
a sports enthusiast, Sherm was able to bring
the Portland Trail Blazers to Kids Unlimited to
play ball with the children.
Additionally, Sherm always believed that
pursuing higher education is foundational for
the well-being and success of communities.
Sherm would say, ‘‘As time goes by, our soci-
ety demands educated people. Our country
needs educated people.’’ Therefore, he and
Wanda established a series of scholarship
funds to promote education and help students
in financial need. These include The Sherm
and Wanda Olsrud Scholarship Fund and The
Olsrud 4H and FFA Scholarship Fund that
offer renewable $5,000 scholarships to grad-
uating high school seniors, as well as the
Sherm & Wanda Olsrud Endowed Scholarship
that offers up to $5,000 to students attending
Southern Oregon University.
Over his long life, Sherm has demonstrated
integrity, duty, and true generosity in every
community in which he lived. Sherm’s busi-
ness acumen and benevolence are well
known across most of the southern Oregon re-
gion including Douglas, Lane, Josephine,
Jackson, and Klamath counties for the past 40
years and his legacy will continue for many
years into the future. In fact, the Olsrud family

HONORING MR. KENNETH HILTON
HICKMAN
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize the
achievements of Mr. Kenneth Hilton (K.H.)
Hickman, a proud native and star athlete of
Freeport, Illinois; Hickman served in the
United States Navy as a Fire Control Techni-
cian Third Class (FT3) aboard the USS Bristol
857 Naval Destroyer. The USS Bristol was
first commissioned in 1945 and served val-
iantly during World War II from 1944 to 1946,
including involvement at Pearl Harbor on June
9, 1945. From the time of Hickman’s enlist-
ment in 1954 to 1958, the USS Bristol was in-
volved in various post-war activities: participa-
tion in operation SPRINGBOARD, refresher
trainings in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Anti-Sub-
marine Duty with the Commander, Submarine
Force Atlantic (ComAntiSubLant), a four
month tour with the Sixth Fleet in the Medi-
terranean, involvement in the NATO exercise
NEW BROOM V and various HUK operations,
and a midshipman to Valpariso via the Pan-
ama Canal to engage in even more NATO ex-
ercises. Hickman’s opportunity to have a well-
rounded naval experience while serving his
country was extensive and evident aboard the
USS Bristol.
On the morning of Thursday, July 31, 1958,
just two years after graduating from Freeport
High School in 1954 and enlisting to serve the
U.S. Military, Hickman was lost at sea while
serving. During time of his death, the ship had
set sail for Bergen, Norway, Balboa, Spain
and Hamburg, Germany for a six-week Mid-
shipman cruise and Fleet Exercise. After 61
long years, we celebrate the life and service of
Mr. Hickman. The state of Illinois is grateful for
his sacrifice and blessed to honor such a pub-
lic servant who dedicated his young years for
a noble cause.

HONORING THE LIFE OF
CHRISTOPHER KELLY RAPP
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and recognize the late Christopher Kelly
Rapp, who was senselessly murdered in the
Virginia Beach Municipal Center shooting. Vir-
ginia Beach lost Christopher far too soon.
Christopher worked as an engineer for the
Department of Public Works for the City of Vir-
ginia Beach. Rapp graduated from Old Domin-
ion University and studied civil engineering.
He brought his knowledge and expertise to the
city just 11 months prior to the shooting.
Friends described Rapp as positive and kind.
Rapp’s life of hard work and service to the
community, as well as his positive attitude, will
forever be remembered.
Christopher Kelly Rapp will be missed by all
his loved ones. Hampton Roads significantly
benefited from his presence; he made our
community a better place. Today we remem-
ber and honor his life.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E907
July 11, 2019
Mr. Sasaki was born in 1938 in Tokyo,
Japan. He has pursued his education in many
different subjects and countries. He attended a
seminary run by German Jesuits, studied me-
chanical engineering at a Japanese university,
received a degree with honors in industrial de-
sign from the Royal College of Art in London,
earned his Master of Science in Ekistics from
Athens Technical Institute in Greece, com-
pleted postgraduate studies at the Institute of
Traffic and Transpiration Engineering at UC
Berkeley, and studied oceanography at the
Scripps Institute at UC San Diego.
Mr. Sasaki has worked tirelessly on water
issues in Sonoma County for over twenty
years. He has devoted much of his time to de-
veloping water solutions and strategies, name-
ly a balance between the water needs of farm-
ers, fish, and urban residents. His work with
the County was integral for the implementation
of the Sustainable Groundwater Management
Act. Mr. Sasaki joined the Sonoma County
Farm Bureau in 1985 after he and his wife
bought their ranch and began to revive a ne-
glected vineyard on the property. He has sat
on the Sonoma County Farm Bureau Board of
Directors for over fifteen years and was Presi-
dent of the Board from 2013 to 2014. He is
also a member and past Chairman of Sonoma
County Farm Bureau’s Water Committee and

a member of the Board of the Sonoma Ecol-
ogy Center and is a member of the California
Farm Bureau Federation Water Committee.
In addition to his contributions to Sonoma
County Farm Bureau and our farming commu-
nity, Mr. Sasaki is the President of Quantum
Mechanics Corporation. Mr. Sasaki is known
for his astute analytical skills, which he has
employed in his work to help farmers and
landowners.
Madam Speaker, Tito Sasaki is an integral
member of our farming community and is de-
serving of his induction to the Sonoma County
Farm Bureau Hall of Fame. It is therefore fit-
ting and proper that we honor him here today.

WE MUST FIGHT TO PRESERVE
SOCIAL SECURITY FOR
MILLENNIALS
HON. JOHN B. LARSON
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 11, 2019
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to include in the RECORD
the following article, written by Max Richtman,
the president and CEO of the National Com-
mittee to Preserve Social Security and Medi-
care, for my colleagues. As Chairman of the
House Ways and means Subcommittee on
Social Security, I urge my colleagues to fight
to protect Social Security for all working Amer-
icans, especially millennials who will rely on
Social Security significantly more than their
parents’ or grandparents’ generation. Mr.
Richtman’s article makes a persuasive case to
rebut efforts to divide the generations by
claiming that today’s millennials bear the bur-
den of supporting today’s retirees. The Social
Security 2100 Act will ensure that Social Se-
curity is there for generations to come for all,
including millennials.
WE MUST FIGHT TO PRESERVE SOCIAL
SECURITY FOR MILLENNIALS
(By Max Richtman)
If you ’re a millennial, you have may been
led to believe that you have a better chance
of seeing a UFO or Bigfoot than receiving a
Social Security check. In a recent survey,
some 80 percent of millennials are concerned
that they won’t be able to receive any Social
Security benefits upon retirement.
With the steady drumbeat of dystopian
disinformation flowing from Social Secu-
rity’s opponents and many in the media, who
could blame them? No wonder the young
adults I talk to at town hall meetings across
the country tell me the same thing: ‘‘Social
Security will not be there for me when I need
it.’’ Let me assure the U.S.’s young people
that Social Security will be there for you in
the future, if you fight for it now.
Don’t listen to so-called ‘‘entitlement re-
formers’’ who try to divide the generations
by telling you it’s unfair that millennials
‘‘support’’ today’s retirees through Social
Security payroll contributions. This ignores
the fact that the program has always been a
compact between the generations—and has
provided Americans with basic income in re-
tirement for more than 80 years. Social Se-
curity is the bedrock of the U.S.’s working
and middle classes. We can’t allow conserv-
ative ideologues to erode it.
These ‘‘reformers’’ count on people forget-
ting that Social Security is much more than
a retirement income program. It also pro-
vides disability, spousal and survivor’s bene-
fits to Americans of all ages. The average
worker with a spouse and two children would
have to purchase more than $600,000 in life
and disability insurance to replace the pro-
tections Social Security provides. In fact,
some 1.2 million millennials already receive
Social Security benefits.
Social Security is as much a millennials’
program as anyone else’s. Current trends in-
dicate that millennials will rely on Social
Security retirement benefits significantly
more than their parents’ or grandparents’
generations. Increasing income inequality,
wage stagnation, student loan debt, declin-
ing home ownership, the gig economy and
the scarcity of employer-provided pensions
have put young peoples’ retirement security
at risk.
The National Institute on Retirement Se-
curity reports that two-thirds of millennials
haven’t saved any money for retirement. At
the same time, future seniors face rapidly es-
calating living costs. Basic expenses—from
housing to health care to groceries—will be-
come even pricier in decades to come. What’s
more, millennials will live longer on average
than today’s retirees, meaning they’ll have
to spread out their financial resources over a
greater number of years.
That’s why Social Security will be even
more crucial in keeping today’s young peo-
ple out of poverty in old age. According to a
recent Urban Institute study, the average
millennial will receive $1,000,000 in Social Se-
curity retirement benefits. That’s about
twice the average amount that today’s retir-
ees collect. But this will happen only if we
are able to prevent ‘‘reformers’’ from cutting
benefits, including raising the retirement
age and adopting a more miserly formula for
calculating yearly cost-of-living adjust-
ments. Don’t let them fool you into believing
that slashing benefits is the only way to
keep the system solvent for the future—or
that we should gamble with the Social Secu-
rity trust fund by investing it on Wall
Street.
In fact, there is another path forward,
championed by Rep. John Larson (D-Con-
necticut) and Democratic presidential can-
didate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont),
among others in Congress. Both have intro-
duced legislation that would put Social Se-
curity on a solid financial footing for the fu-
ture, while Rep. Larson’s bill provides a
modest, but much-needed boost in benefits.
Each bill would adjust the Social Security
payroll wage cap (currently set at $132,900) so
that the wealthy would begin paying their
fair share into the program.
Representative Larson’s bill also includes
a 1.2 percent increase in employee payroll
contributions spread out over 24 years. The
average worker would contribute an extra 50
cents per week toward future Social Security
benefits—the equivalent of one Starbucks
coffee drink every two months. As Larson
points out, that’s a pretty good deal in ex-
change for the peace of mind of knowing So-
cial Security will remain fully solvent
through the end of the century, with more
generous benefits and cost-of-living adjust-
ments. If you’re an average income earner,
you will surely need both to pay your bills in
old age.
Millennials, here’s a chance to harness the
power of your generation to exert influence
on the future course of Social Security. In-
stead of accepting the false narrative that
Social Security is doomed, join your parents
and grandparents in protecting Social Secu-
rity as if your future financial well-being de-
pends on it—because it does.

Beach lost Robert far too soon.
Williams, known as Bobby, worked for the

Bobby will be missed by all his loved ones.
Hampton Roads significantly benefited from
