Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 3, 2019 No. 1
House of Representatives
This being the day fixed by the 20th
Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States, for the meeting of the
116th Congress of the United States,
the Representatives-elect met in their
Hall, and at noon were called to order
by the Clerk of the House of Represent-
atives, Hon. Karen L. Haas.
Reverend EMANUEL CLEAVER, St.
James United Methodist Church, Kan-
sas City, Missouri, offered the fol-
lowing prayer:
Almighty and endearing God, whose
Lordship is just and true, we bow in
recognition of that Godship in this hal-
lowed and consequential moment of in-
augurating a Speaker to preside over
and provide leadership to the House of
Representatives of the United States.
May we temporarily hush our pre-
occupation with vexing considerations
that deplete our energy and consume
our hours to seek now favor from Thou
whose immaculate voting record dem-
onstrates our need of Thy guidance.
We pray, O Lord, for wisdom suffi-
cient to lean not on our unaided privi-
lege and power to embrace our sum-
mons to address the great challenges of
this day that are fraught with trib-
alism at home and turbulence abroad.
Thou who has the whole world in His
hand, to Thee we pray for inner re-
sources to rise as a legislative body
above political selfishness and then
shrink to a level of humility and peni-
tence that would be in harmony with
Your will.
When we leave this place, we will,
with Your blessing, launch a bold at-
tempt to become the architects of a
kindlier Nation that is purging itself of
any and all prejudices which degrade
the unmatched blessings You have
awarded the people of this great Na-
tion.
Inspire us, the Members of this au-
gust body, to dedicate ourselves to the
healing of open sores in a land where
there is far too much mistrust and en-
mity of those who are different.
Led now in this temple of governance
by the Speaker and leaders of both
sides of the political aisle, we pray for
Your presence in this place.
We need Thee every hour. O Lord,
how we need thee. When we are puz-
zled, guide us with Your hand of direc-
tion. When we are worn and wearied,
grant us light to find a just and fair
way, and when we are confused, anoint
our priorities and pet projects so that
any diminutive success may give You
the glory.
Receive now this prayer, O Lord.
Amen.
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The CLERK. The Representatives-
elect and their guests will please re-
main standing and join in the Pledge of
Allegiance.
The Clerk led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The CLERK. As directed by law, the
Clerk of the House has prepared the of-
ficial roll of the Representatives-elect.
Certificates of election covering 434
seats in the 116th Congress have been
received by the Clerk of the House. The
Clerk has not received a certificate of
election from the Ninth District of the
State of North Carolina. The names of
those persons whose credentials show
that they were regularly elected as
Representatives in accord with the
laws of their respective States or of the
United States will be called.
The Representatives-elect will record
their presence by electronic device and
their names will be reported in alpha-
betical order by State, beginning with
the State of Alabama, to determine
whether a quorum is present.
Representatives-elect will have a
minimum of 15 minutes to record their
presence by electronic device.
Representatives-elect who have not
obtained their voting ID cards may do
so now in the Speaker’s lobby.
The call was taken by electronic de-
vice, and the following Representa-
tives-elect responded to their names:

ELECTION OF SPEAKER
The CLERK. Pursuant to law and
precedent, the next order of business is
the election of the Speaker of the
House of Representatives for the 116th
Congress.
Nominations are now in order.
The Clerk recognizes the gentleman
from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES).
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Clerk, let me
begin by welcoming all of the Members
and our families to the people’s House
in connection with the start of the
116th Congress.
The Scripture says:
Weeping may endure during the long night,
but joy will come in the morning.
Madam Clerk, it is with great joy
that I rise today, as directed by the
House Democratic Caucus, to place the
name of NANCY PELOSI in nomination
to be the next Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives.
Without question, NANCY PELOSI has
a track record of legislative success
that is unparalleled in modern Amer-
ican history.
NANCY PELOSI captained the ship that
defeated the effort to privatize Social
Security; rescued our economy in the
midst of the Great Recession; saved the
American automobile industry; pro-
vided affordable healthcare to more

than 20 million Americans; created the
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau; enacted a minimum wage in-
crease for the first time in 10 years;
struck a blow against mass incarcer-
ation with passage of the Fair Sen-
tencing Act; and provided relief to tens
of millions of Americans who are credit
card holders that were being defrauded.
But NANCY PELOSI is just getting start-
ed.
In the 116th Congress, she will con-
tinue to fight hard for the people.
NANCY PELOSI will fight to lower
healthcare costs; strengthen the Af-
fordable Care Act; protect people with
preexisting conditions; increase pay for
everyday Americans; enact a real infra-
structure plan; clean up construction;
defend the Dreamers; fix the Voting
Rights Act; and end the era of voter
suppression once and for all.
b 1245
She will fight for a country that pro-
vides for the poor, works for working
families, makes sense for the middle
class, stands up for senior citizens, in-
novates in the inner cities, and
strengthens suburban communities.
NANCY PELOSI is a woman of faith; a
loving wife; a mother of five; a grand-
mother of nine; a sophisticated strate-
gist; a legendary legislator; a voice for
the voiceless; a defender of the disen-
franchised; a powerful, profound, pro-
phetic, principled public servant, and
that is why we stand squarely behind
her today.
Let me be clear: House Democrats
are down with NDP, NANCY
D’ALESANDRO PELOSI, the once and fu-
ture Speaker of the United States
House of Representatives. I proudly
place her name in nomination.
May God bless her. May God bless the
United States of America.
The CLERK. The Clerk recognizes
the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.
CHENEY).
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Clerk, I would
like to begin, I think, by thanking my
colleague, the gentleman from New
York (Mr. JEFFRIES), and welcoming
all of the Members and the families
who are here with us today.
Madam Clerk, we gather today in
this magnificent place, in this body, a
place where there is no other like it in
the world, the United States House of
Representatives, the people’s House.
This is the place where the great bat-
tles and debates about human liberty
and freedom have been waged since the
beginning of our Republic.
It was on these grounds, Madam
Clerk, that Abraham Lincoln sought to
heal this Nation in his second inau-
gural address.
It was here that we passed the 14th
Amendment to the Constitution, guar-
anteeing equal protection under the
law.
It was here, Madam Clerk, in this
Chamber 100 years ago this year, that
we passed the 19th Amendment, grant-
ing women the right to vote—I would
point out, Madam Clerk, finally catch-
ing up with my home State of Wyo-
ming, the first place in all the world
where women had suffrage, beginning
in 1869.
Now, Madam Clerk, we have not al-
ways gotten it right. One legislator fa-
mously said: ‘‘We have the power to do
any damn fool thing we want to do, and
we seem to do it about every 10 min-
utes.’’
Madam Clerk, that was a Senator
and a Democrat.
On this ground, Madam Clerk, we
have inaugurated Presidents and
mourned them, declared wars and cele-
brated peace, debated all the issues fac-
ing this great Republic down through
the years.
Today, as we take our oath of office,
Democrat and Republican alike, we in-
herit that legacy and that duty to de-
fend and protect our Constitution.
Madam Clerk, it is my high honor
today to have the great privilege to
nominate the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY) to lead us in
that work as Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives.
Leader MCCARTHY is the grandson of
a cattle rancher. He is the son of a fire-
fighter. He grew up in a working class
family. He started and ran his own
small business, Kevin O’s Deli, in Ba-
kersfield. He paid his way through col-
lege. He learned firsthand that the
Government of the United States is
more of a burden than a help to small
businesses all across this country.
No one has fought harder, Madam
Clerk, for the rights and freedoms of
American families to ensure that they
get to keep more of what they earn so
that the American Dream is accessible
to all.
No one has been a greater champion
of ensuring our government is limited,
exercising its constitutional obliga-
tions to defend our rights and resisting
the urge that our colleagues on the
other side of the aisle constantly seek
to fulfill of empowering Federal bu-
reaucrats to tell us how to live.
Leader MCCARTHY will always look
for ways to work with our colleagues
on the other side of the aisle when we
can, but he will never compromise on
our fundamental rights and freedoms.
Leader MCCARTHY knows our rights
come from God. They are enshrined in
our Constitution. He knows govern-
ment is not the source of our liberty;
rather, it is instituted among men and
women to secure our liberty.
Leader MCCARTHY has led us through
the 115th Congress in unmatched his-
toric productivity, including passage of
the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, be-
cause we know, Madam Clerk, that the
American people know better than the
government how to spend their money.
Leader MCCARTHY led us in passage
of the SUPPORT Act, providing impor-
tant resources to help address the dev-
astating opioid crisis across this
Nation.
He helped work to pass the VA MIS-
SION Act, so that we could finally pro-
vide our veterans with the care that
they deserve.
Leader MCCARTHY led us in repealing
historic numbers of Obama-era regula-
tions that were strangling families,
small businesses, and community
banks all across our Nation.
He was the leader in the important
fight to combat human trafficking.
And, Madam Clerk, Leader MCCAR-
THY led us in passing legislation to se-
cure our borders, keep our Nation safe,
end the devastating practice of sanc-
tuary cities, and, yes, Madam Clerk,
build the wall.
Leader MCCARTHY also led to ensure
that we pass the American Health Care
Act to expand access and options, and
put patients and families in the driv-
er’s seat, not government bureaucrats.
Finally, Leader MCCARTHY made sure
that we passed on time and at a suffi-
cient level for the first time in a dec-
ade appropriations to fund the United
States Armed Forces to fulfill our most
sacred and important constitutional
duty to provide for the common de-
fense.
Madam Clerk, because he will lead us
in fighting for all the people of this
great Nation from all walks of life; be-
cause he will stand against the fraud of
socialism, which strips power from the
people and gives it to the government;
because he knows that the most impor-
tant words of our founding document
are the very first words, ‘‘We the Peo-
ple,’’ as chair of the Republican House
Conference, I am honored and directed
by the vote of that conference to
present for election to the Office of
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives for the 116th Congress the name
of the Honorable KEVIN MCCARTHY, a
Representative-elect from the State of
California.
The CLERK. The names of the Hon-
orable NANCY PELOSI, a Representative-
elect from the State of California, and
the Honorable KEVIN MCCARTHY, a Rep-
resentative-elect from the State of
California, have been placed in nomina-
tion.
Are there further nominations?
There being no further nominations,
the Clerk appoints the following tell-
ers:
The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.
KAPTUR);
The gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
RODNEY DAVIS);
The gentlewoman from California
(Ms. LOFGREN); and
The gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina (Ms. FOXX).
The tellers will come forward and
take their seats at the desk in front of
the Speaker’s rostrum.
The roll will now be called, and those
responding to their names will indicate
by surname the nominee of their choos-
ing.
The Reading Clerk will now call the
roll.
The tellers having taken their places,
the House proceeded to vote for the
Speaker.
The following is the result of the
vote:

b 1415
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker,
colleagues, friends, and fellow Ameri-
cans, it is an honor to serve with you
and to welcome you to the first day of
the 116th United States House of Rep-
resentatives.
We are here in this Chamber because
of the faith of your neighbors and sup-
port of your families. We are here
today to represent the voice and the
vote of 325 million Americans.
Now I would like everyone to pause.
I want you to reflect on this fact. In
the last 230 years, dating back to the
founding of our Republic, fewer than
11,000 Americans have had the privilege
to stand here as a Member of the
House, just as you do, chosen by their
fellow citizens to represent them in
Washington.
What an amazing, invigorating, and,
yes, frustrating experiment that is:
representative democracy.
The ink was barely dry on the Con-
stitution when Ben Franklin wondered
out loud whether this new Nation was
capable of keeping its government and
its freedom that had been granted to us
generation to generation. Centuries
later, people still harbor similar con-
cerns. They wonder if Congress truly
represents them, if it is still capable of
solving big problems.
Well, there are no guarantees. It is
up to us, all of us in this room, to
make Congress work, to create and de-
bate, just like our Founding Fathers
did many years ago, with courage, with
commitment and resolve.
We are a very small group with a
very large responsibility. The burden
on us 435 Members is to represent 325
million Americans faithfully, to work
together so that tomorrow is better
than today. As Ronald Reagan advised
us: America is too great for small
dreams. When we work together, we
succeed together as one Nation.
We are now entering a period of di-
vided government, but that is no ex-
cuse for gridlock or inaction. We are at
our best when we focus not on retribu-
tion but on building a more perfect
Union.
But while we seek cooperation, there
is one core principle upon which we
will not compromise: Republicans will
always choose personal freedom over
government control.
On this very floor, we served on and
hosted some of the toughest debates in
the Nation’s history, but it is also
where some of the most noblest
achievements have happened.
This House has weathered times of
triumph and crisis. It still stands be-
cause it is built not on sand but on the
solid rock of constitutional principles.
Today marks a new chapter in this
House’s pursuit of a more perfect
Union. The country knows NANCY
PELOSI as an experienced leader with
three decades of service in Congress, a
fighter for her causes, and a true trail-
blazer.
Even when we disagree with one an-
other completely, it is important to re-
member that we are bound together in
a common cause: our love for America.
As fellow citizens and friends, let us
lead together to show the people that
we are truly their voice and their vote:
in that spirit, in the spirit of a more
perfect Union, and in the unshakeable
belief that America was, is, and always
will be the greatest Nation on the face
of the Earth.
In that spirit, I extend my hand of
friendship to every Member of this
body. And to the Speaker of the House,
NANCY PELOSI, I extend to you this
gavel.
Ms. PELOSI. Thank you very much,
Leader MCCARTHY. I look forward to
working with you in a bipartisan way
for the good of our country, respecting
our constituents—who you are, every
one of you. I respect you and the con-
stituents who sent each and every one
of us here. They expect and deserve for
us to try to find our common ground,
and we must try to do that: stand our
ground where we can’t, but always ex-
tend the hand of friendship.
Thank you, KEVIN MCCARTHY, for
your leadership. I look forward to
working with you. Congratulations on
being a leader of the Congress.
And congratulations to each and
every one of you. New Members of Con-
gress, newly re-elected Members of
Congress, thank you for your courage
to run for office and to serve in this
distinguished body.
Every 2 years, we gather in this
Chamber for a sacred ritual under the
dome of this temple of democracy, the
Capitol of the United States. We renew
the great American experiment.
I am particularly proud to be woman
Speaker of the House of this Congress,
which marks the 100th year of women
having the right to vote, and that we
all have the ability and the privilege to
serve, with over 100 women Members of
Congress, the largest number in his-
tory.
b 1430
As Leader MCCARTHY said, each of us
comes to this Chamber strengthened by
the trust of our constituents and the
love of our families. Let us congratu-
late and welcome all of the families
who are here today. Thank you to our
families.
Let me take the privilege of thank-
ing my dear husband, Paul, and our
five children, Nancy Corinne, Chris-
tine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra,
and our nine grandchildren, Madeleine
and Alexander, Liam, Sean and Ryan,
Thomas and Paul, Bella, and Octavio.
We are so proud of all of our grand-
children, and we are proud of every-
one’s grandchildren and children who
are here today. We will see more of
them.
I am also proud of my D’Alesandro
family that is here from Baltimore for
us too. And in that spirit, my mother
and father and my brother, Tommy,
who was also mayor of Baltimore,
taught us, through their example, that
public service is a noble calling, that
we should serve with our hearts full of
love, and that America’s heart is full of
love.
Singing that to us last night, my
comrade, an Italian American, with all
that pride, I want to acknowledge Tony
Bennett, who is here with us today as
well. Thank you, Tony. He helped free
the concentration camps during the
time of World War II. He marched with
Martin Luther King. He is a true Amer-
ican patriot. Thank you, Tony.
Again, I want to thank my constitu-
ents from San Francisco who have en-
trusted me to represent them in Con-
gress in the spirit of St. Francis, the
patron saint of San Francisco, and his
song of St. Francis is our anthem:
Make me a channel of Thy peace. We
heard that in church this morning, but
it is our mission.
Let me thank our men and women in
uniform, our veterans, and our mili-
tary families and caregivers whose
service reminds us of our mission to
make the future worthy of their sac-
rifice. To our men and women in uni-
form.
We enter this new Congress with a
sense of great hope and confidence for
the future and deep humility and pray-
erfulness in the face of challenges
ahead.
Our Nation is in a historic moment.
Two months ago the American people
spoke and demanded a new dawn. They
called upon the beauty of our Constitu-
tion, that our system of checks and
balances that protects our democracy,
remembering that the legislative
branch is Article I, the first branch of
government, coequal to the Presidency
and to the judiciary. They want a Con-
gress that delivers results for the peo-
ple, opening up opportunity, and lifting
up their lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6 January 3, 2019
We are hearing the voice of the fu-
ture there. How beautiful.
When our new Members take the
oath, our Congress will be refreshed
and our democracy will be strength-
ened by their optimism, idealism, and
patriotism of this transformative
freshman class. Congratulations to all
of you in the freshman class. Working
together, we will redeem the promise of
the American Dream for every family,
advancing progress for every commu-
nity.
We must be pioneers of the future.
This Congress must accelerate a future
that advances America’s preeminence
in the world and opens up opportuni-
ties for all, building an economy that
gives all Americans the tools they need
to succeed in the 21st century, public
education, workforce development,
good-paying jobs, and secure pensions.
We have heard from too many fami-
lies who wonder, in this time of innova-
tion and globalization, if they have a
place in the economy of the future. We
must remove all doubt that they do
and say to them individually, we will
have an economy that works for you.
Let us declare that we will call upon
bold thinking to address the disparity
of income in America, which is at the
root of the crisis of confidence felt by
so many Americans. As Justice Bran-
deis said, we may have democracy, or
we may have wealth concentrated in
the hands of a few, but we cannot have
both. We must end that injustice and
restore the public’s faith in a better fu-
ture for themselves and their children.
We must be champions of the middle
class and all those who aspire to it be-
cause the middle class is the backbone
of our democracy; it has been since the
birth of our democracy.
Aristotle said, it is manifest that the
best political community is formed by
citizens of the middle class, in which
the middle class is large and stronger
than any of the other classes. We must
fight for the middle class that is fair
and fiscally sound, protecting Medi-
care, Medicaid, and Social Security.
We must also face the existential
threat of our time, the climate crisis, a
crisis manifested in natural disasters
of epic proportion. The American peo-
ple understand the urgency. The people
are ahead of the Congress. The Con-
gress must join them, and that is why
we have created a Select Committee on
the Climate Crisis.
The entire Congress must work to
put an end to the inaction and denial of
science that threaten the planet and
the future. This is a decision, a public
health decision about clean air, clean
water for our children’s health. It is a
decision for America’s global pre-
eminence in green technologies. It is a
decision, a security decision to keep us
all safe, and a moral decision to be
good stewards of God’s creation.
We have no illusions that our work
will be easy, and that all of us in this
Chamber will always agree. But let
each of us pledge that, when we dis-
agree, we respect each other and we re-
spect the truth.
We will debate and advance good
ideas, no matter where they come
from. And in that spirit, Democrats
will be offering the Senate Republican
appropriations legislation to reopen
government later today. We will do so
to meet the needs of the American peo-
ple, to protect our borders, and to re-
spect our workers.
I pledge that this Congress will be
transparent, bipartisan, and unifying;
that we will seek to reach across the
aisle in this Chamber and across divi-
sions across our Nation.
In the past 2 years, the American
people have spoken. Tens of thousands
of public events were held. Hundreds of
thousands of people turned out. Mil-
lions of calls were made. Countless
families, even sick little children, our
little lobbyists, our little lobbyists
bravely came forward to tell their sto-
ries, and they made a big difference.
Now, the floor of this House must be
America’s town hall, where people will
see our debates and where their voices
will be heard and affect our decisions.
Transparency will be the order of the
day.
As Mr. JEFFRIES, our distinguished
chairman said, we will follow our man-
date for the people. I thank him for his
kind nomination, and accept those
kind remarks on behalf of the entire
House Democratic Caucus which made
all of those victories possible, some of
them in a bold partisan way.
Empower our mandate for the people,
to lower healthcare costs and prescrip-
tion drug prices and protect people
with pre-existing medical conditions;
to increase paychecks by rebuilding
America with green and modern infra-
structure from sea to shining sea—we
look forward to working with the
President on that—to pass H.R. 1, to
restore integrity to government so
that people can have confidence in a
government that works for the people,
not the special interests; H.R. 1.
This House will take overdue legisla-
tion that has bipartisan support, bipar-
tisan support in the Congress and
across the country. We will make our
communities safer and keep our sacred
promise to the victims and survivors
and families of gun violence by passing
commonsense, bipartisan background
check legislation.
We will make America fairer by pass-
ing the Equality Act to end discrimina-
tion against LGBTQ communities; and
we will make America more American
by protecting our patriotic, courageous
Dreamers.
All three of those legislative initia-
tives have bipartisan support in this
body. And when we are talking about
the Dreamers, let us remember what
President Reagan said in his last
speech as President of the United
States. I urge you all to read it. It is a
beautiful speech.
He said, if we ever close the door to
new Americans, our leadership role in
the world will soon be lost. Ronald
Reagan.
Our common cause is to find and
forge a way forward for our country.
Let us stand for the people to promote
liberty and justice for all as we pledge
every day; and always, always, keep
our Nation safe from threats, old and
new, from terrorism and cyber warfare,
overseas and here at home. To protect
and defend, that is the oath we all take
to serve in this body. That is the oath
we take, to protect and defend.
I close by remembering a cherished
former Member of this body who rose
to become a beloved President of the
United States and who, last month, re-
turned to the Capitol once more, and
he came this time to lie in state. That
week we honored President George
Herbert Walker Bush with eulogies,
tributes and tears.
Today, I single out one of his great
achievements, working with both
Democrats and Republicans to write
the Americans With Disabilities Act
into the laws of our land. I thank
STENY HOYER for being such a big, im-
portant part of that.
In 2010, we marked the 20th anniver-
sary of the act by making it possible
for our colleagues with disabilities to
preside over the House by changing the
mechanics of this podium. In that spir-
it of equality and justice, let me an-
nounce that this afternoon, the first
Speaker pro tempore I will yield to of
the 116th Congress will be Congressman
JIM LANGEVIN of Rhode Island.
b 1445
As we take the oath of office today,
we accept responsibility as daunting
and demanding as any the previous
generations of leadership have faced.
Guided by the vision and values of
our Founders, the sacrifice of our men
and women in uniform, and the aspira-
tions that we have for our children, let
us meet that responsibility with wis-
dom, with courage, and with grace.
Together, we will let it be known
that this House will truly be the peo-
ple’s House.
Let us pray that God may bless our
work and crown our good with brother-
hood and sisterhood from sea to shin-
ing sea.
God bless you all, and God bless the
United States of America.
I am now ready to take the oath of
office.
I ask the dean of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Honorable DON
YOUNG, to administer the oath of of-
fice. But before we do, Mr. Dean, and I
thank you for your great leadership in
the Congress over the decades, I would
like to call my grandchildren up to be
here when I take the oath, and any
other children who want to join them.
Mr. YOUNG then administered the
oath of office to Ms. PELOSI of Cali-
fornia, as follows:
Do you solemnly swear that you will sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the
United States against all enemies, foreign
and domestic; that you will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same; that you take
this obligation freely, without any mental
reservation or purpose of evasion; and that
you will well and faithfully discharge the du-
ties of the office on which you are about to
enter, so help you God.

Messrs. KING of New York and
ADERHOLT changed their vote from
‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’
So the motion to table was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the minority
leader or his designee—in this case, Mr.
COLE—pending which I yield myself
such time as I may consume. During
consideration of this resolution, all
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
be given 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks on H.
Res. 5 and H. Res. 6.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, by a
10-million-vote margin, the American
people entrusted Democrats to run this
body. So it is finally a new day for this
Congress, and this rules package is our
first opportunity to chart a new
course.
In a sign that we intend to run this
place differently, these ideas were de-
veloped from the bottom up, not the
top down. We asked every Member for
their ideas, from the longest serving to
the newly elected, Democrats and Re-
publicans alike.
We spoke to experts, inside and out-
side this Congress, from every House
committee, from offices like the Par-
liamentarian and the General Counsel,
from the Progressive Caucus and the
Black Caucus to the Hispanic Caucus,
the Blue Dog Coalition and the bipar-
tisan Problem Solvers Caucus, and
from outside groups engaged on these
issues.
We spent months vetting suggestions
and came up with a final package that
reflects all corners of the Democratic
Caucus and this Congress.
Never before has a rules package
been developed like this. Our collabo-
rative process made the final product a
much stronger one. It modernizes this
Chamber in five key ways.
First, it restores the people’s voice
by aligning Congress’ agenda with the
priorities of the American people. That
includes enabling this House to defend
the Affordable Care Act’s preexisting
conditions coverage; setting up consid-
eration of H.R. 1, a historic set of re-
forms to reduce money in politics; cre-
ating a Select Committee on the Cli-
mate Crisis so we no longer ignore the
defining issues we all face; ending the
Holman rule to protect Federal work-
ers; strengthening representation by
giving rights to Delegates and the
Resident Commissioner in the Com-
mittee of the Whole and ensuring they
can be appointed to joint committees;
and honoring our commitment to
workers by putting ‘‘labor’’ back in the
Committee on Education and Labor.
Second, it restores the legislative
process by returning to regular order
and abiding by the principle that good
ideas should finally be debated and
voted on again. That includes estab-
lishing a real 72-hour rule so Members
of Congress have time to actually read
the major bills they are voting on, re-
quiring bills to have a hearing and a
markup before they go through the
Rules Committee and to the floor, and
creating a truly bipartisan select com-
mittee to modernize Congress and keep
ourselves accountable so that this
place actually works for the American
people.
Third, it restores oversight and eth-
ics by cleaning up Washington, and it
subjects the Trump administration to
something it has never had: real over-
sight. That means making common-
sense changes like prohibiting Mem-
bers of Congress and staff from serving
on boards of publicly traded companies,
making sure non-disclosure agree-
ments aren’t used to prevent people
here from speaking out about possible
wrongdoing, providing assistance and
training to help congressional offices
properly protect whistleblowers, and
setting a policy that Members indicted
for serious crimes should resign from
leadership roles and committee assign-
ments.
Fourth, it restores budget rules by
preventing Members from using the
debt ceiling as a political weapon, end-
ing the sham budgetary policy of
CutGo that pretends that tax cuts
somehow pay for themselves, and pre-
venting our Federal lands from being
given away for free.
Fifth, it restores inclusion to ensure
Congress reflects the diversity of the
American people, people of all back-
grounds, including women and the
LGBTQ community. That includes ban-
ning discrimination on the basis of sex-
ual orientation and gender identity,
creating a first-ever diversity office so
the workers here are as diverse as the

H10 January 3, 2019
real world, clarifying the rules so that
Members and staff are finally allowed
to wear religious headwear on the
House floor and requiring Members to
reimburse taxpayers for discrimination
settlements.
Those are just some of the many
rules changes that are included here,
and I am especially proud that we have
also included language that ensures the
direct vote on privileged war powers
resolutions and directs the House Of-
fice of General Counsel to explore all
possible legal options for responding to
the administration’s attempt to cir-
cumvent Congress and limit access to
SNAP for hundreds of thousands of
hungry Americans, because this major-
ity will not sit idly by as the Trump
administration beats up on poor peo-
ple.
Each change is the result of a real ex-
change of ideas, an honest attempt at
unrigging the rules so that the people’s
House actually works for the people
again.
Now, Mr. Speaker, this rules package
isn’t some panacea that will fix all our
problems. As important as it is, there
is something that is even more impor-
tant, and that is how we conduct our-
selves day to day, week after week, and
year after year, because you can’t leg-
islate civility.
As chairman of the Rules Committee,
I am ready to do my part to institute
a more accommodating process, one
that gives all Members a voice and
brings the committee back to the days
where big ideas were actually debated,
where Members were treated with re-
spect, and where the discourse wasn’t
so coarse.
I am not naive, Mr. Speaker. I know
that, even if this House elevates the
discourse here, we cannot control the
other branches of government. The
Senate will work its will, and the
President may still reach for his phone
to tweet insults and to name-call. But
we can and we should be the example of
how Congress should operate, and I am
proud that this Democratic majority
has developed a historic rules package
that will immediately help restore in-
tegrity to this institution.
I would like to thank the Office of
the Parliamentarian and the Office of
the Legislative Counsel for their tech-
nical assistance in drafting this pack-
age. Their hard work and their profes-
sionalism is a credit to this House.
I also want to thank the incredible
staff of the Rules Committee, which
spent countless hours trying to help as-
semble all these ideas, vet these ideas,
and put this package together.
This rule also includes language that
will allow us to finally vote on reopen-
ing the government on day one of this
new Congress.
b 1615
Bills were negotiated in a bipartisan
way with the Senate that would bring
an end to the President’s unnecessary
and costly shutdown. Not a single
penny is included for any border wall.
It is that simple.
Both sides should agree on this. No
part of our government should be shut
down over the President’s obsession
with a border wall.
Mr. Speaker, we can rebuild this
place and restore integrity again, and
that starts with voting in favor of this
rule, the underlying rules package, and
the legislation to finally end the
Trump shutdown. Let’s get this done so
we can get to work on behalf of the
American people.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise as the designee of
the Republican leader, and I thank
Chairman MCGOVERN for yielding me 30
minutes.
First and foremost, I welcome my
good friend, Mr. MCGOVERN, and con-
gratulate him on being named the
chairman of the Rules Committee.
While he and I have been on opposite
sides of the Rules Committee dais for
years, I know him as a passionate ad-
vocate for his beliefs and as a good
friend. He and his staff have already
been great to work with as we start the
new Congress, and I am very much
looking forward to working with him
in our new roles at the Rules Com-
mittee this Congress.
However, it is unfortunate that I rise
today to oppose the first measure to be
put forth by my friend. I know the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts cares deep-
ly about this institution and wants
nothing more than to foster an open
and fair process.
Over the years, he has called for
more open rules, more amendments,
and more debate time, so it is a little
surprising that this resolution and the
resolution we will consider later pro-
vide for limited debate in some in-
stances, closed rules, and what Demo-
crats in the past have so fondly re-
ferred to as martial law. I understand
there are justifications for these deci-
sions, but I find it noteworthy that the
first measures out of the gate under
the majority include these provisions.
This measure, House Resolution 5,
makes in order both the Democrat
rules package to govern the 116th Con-
gress and separate appropriations
measures to fund the government. The
rules package to start a new Congress
is always an opportunity to start fresh
and improve the institution.
While I applaud certain ideas in this
rules package, as a whole, the package
does not rise to that lofty goal. There
are some good bipartisan ideas in this
package for improving the institution,
but, on the whole, the package reflects
only Democrat priorities. For that rea-
son, I will be opposing it.
In the spirit of bipartisanship, I will
first point out areas of agreement. As I
said previously, there are some good
ideas in this package, and my friend
from Massachusetts should be ap-
plauded for including them. Indeed,
many of these ideas are ones Repub-
licans had previously utilized in Con-
gresses past.
In the last Congress, we maintained
the practice of requiring committees to
hold a Member Day hearing, where
members who were not on a specific
committee could come before the com-
mittee to talk about their pieces of
legislation falling under that commit-
tee’s jurisdiction. I am gratified my
Democrat friends are seeking to con-
tinue that practice.
We are also gratified to see that the
standard for committee markup no-
tices will be 3 business days. This has
been the practice, and I am happy to
see my friends making it official in the
rules.
We also support the idea of a Select
Committee on the Modernization of
Congress. This new select committee
will have 12 members, evenly divided
among Republicans and Democrats,
and will be charged with investigating,
studying, and making recommenda-
tions on modernizing Congress.
While this provision is not perfect
and would have been better had it in-
cluded the Senate, this will give the
House a chance to develop and improve
our processes and modernize the insti-
tution. I will have more to say on this
idea tomorrow, but, for now, I think
many of my Republican colleagues will
certainly be inclined to support it.
I would also like to point out a few
additional good ideas that my friends
have included that we approach with a
tone of skeptical optimism.
First, the majority is requiring that
every bill that comes to the Rules
Committee have been the subject of a
hearing or a markup. I genuinely hope
this produces thoughtful legislation. I
would point out that the hearing re-
quirement is met merely by a com-
mittee of jurisdiction including a list
of hearings that were used to develop
that bill in the committee report. I am
hopeful that committees take this re-
quirement seriously and hold hearings
this Congress directly related to the
measures, as opposed to hearings loose-
ly connected to the legislation or sub-
ject matter.
Second, I believe many Members on
both sides of the aisle support the spir-
it behind the Consensus Calendar.
Under this provision, bills that receive
290 cosponsors and that have not been
reported out by the committee of juris-
diction can receive a floor vote. In gen-
eral, Republicans think this is a good
idea, but we will be interested to see
how it will work in practice and if it
will yield the desired results.
Third, my friends are seeking to re-
place the existing 3-day notice with a
72-hour notice rule. Under this rule,
they must post the text of any legisla-
tion to be considered on the floor 72
hours before it comes to a vote.
Of course, as my friend knows, legis-
lation is sometimes posted late at
night or in the early hours of the
morning, and I am hopeful that this
will not mean a lot of late-night legis-
lating or attempts to pass bills right as
the 72 hours expires. In situations
where the 72 hours lands us at mid-
night, I am hopeful the majority will

view the 72 hours as a minimum and
will wait to hold votes until the light
of day, as the American people deserve.
As my friend also knows, he and I
have had discussions off the floor about
the impact of this provision in the rule
that could impact the inclusion of mi-
nority views, and I appreciate him
working with me on legislative history
clarifying that provision and ensuring
that the rule is in no way intended to
suppress minority or dissenting views.
As with the consensus calendar, we are
interested to see how these provisions
will work in practice.
Mr. Speaker, now that I have let my
good friend know what he got right, it
is time for me to let him know where
we think he went wrong.
First and foremost, the Democratic
rules package repeals a lot of the crit-
ical fiscal responsibility measures that
Republicans have adhered to in years
past. The repeal of these measures is
undoubtedly intended to make it easier
to do what Democrats have so often
promised to do: spend more money,
raise taxes to cover it, and repeat the
cycle.
This is a recipe for driving our Na-
tion deeper and deeper into debt. If we
fail to keep our fiscal house in order, it
will threaten the stability of our econ-
omy, our national security, and the
American way of life. Unfortunately, I
believe these rules changes are a threat
to that.
Mr. Speaker, I think this point is so
important that I want to list out the
fiscal responsibility measures that
Democrats are eliminating.
First, Democrats are repealing what
we call the CutGo under Republican
majorities, which meant, in order to
spend money, we had to cut money.
Democrats are replacing it with a
paygo rule, which allows them to offset
the cost of measures by raising revenue
or taxing Americans.
They are eliminating the require-
ment that the House agree by at least
a three-fifths supermajority to raise
revenue through additional Federal in-
come taxes. This will make it easier
for Democrats to tax Americans to pay
for their expensive policies.
The rules package brings back the so-
called Gephardt rule and creates a pro-
vision that says that when the House
passes a budget resolution—not both
Chambers—a separate joint resolution
suspending the Federal debt ceiling
through September 30 of that year is
also deemed to have passed the House.
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I think
this is emblematic of what the Demo-
crats wish to accomplish. The Gep-
hardt rule sweeps the national debt
ceiling under a rug and ensures that
Democrats will be able to spend with
impunity, without worrying about hit-
ting the limit on the national credit
card. I, for one, think this is a bad
practice and bad policy and will lead
only to more and more unnecessary
deficit spending.
The rules package we are considering
today also authorizes the House to in-
tervene in the Texas v. United States
lawsuit over the legality of the Afford-
able Care Act. I cannot think of a sin-
gle member on the Republican side who
wants to give the Speaker this author-
ity.
The same can be said for the provi-
sion authorizing the Office of Legal
Counsel to explore options for respond-
ing to a Department of Agriculture
proposed rulemaking over SNAP bene-
fits for able-bodied adults. Inconceiv-
ably, this provision in the rules is also
hopelessly vague and represents a blan-
ket grant of authority to simply do
something without saying what.
Finally, and most notably, the Demo-
crats are choosing to respond to the de-
mands of one wing of their caucus by
establishing a Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis to study and make rec-
ommendations on climate change.
This committee is ill-conceived from
the start. It takes away jurisdiction
from standing committees in the House
and gives it to a brand new panel
rigged with a supermajority of Demo-
crats. Indeed, we do not know where
exactly the jurisdiction of this panel
begins and ends, since it is conceivable
it could dig into all kinds of areas.
Unlike most other committees in the
House, this one does not adhere to the
negotiated ratio of membership, and,
instead, it calls for nine Democrats and
six Republicans. The Democrats have
also failed to tell us how this new panel
will be funded, where the money for it
will come from, or how it will be used.
Again, I cannot think of a single Re-
publican who thinks this new panel is a
good idea. Earlier in my statement, I
used the phrase ‘‘skeptical optimism’’
to describe how I would approach some
of the rules changes my friends are pro-
posing. With this proposal, I can ap-
proach it with merely skepticism.
Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Ap-
propriations Committee, I would be re-
miss if I did not shift gears and address
the other major proposal covered by
the rule. My Democratic friends are
seeking to make in order on the floor
an appropriations package to reopen
the government agencies that are cur-
rently affected by the shutdown.
While I applaud them for seeking to
fully fund the government, which is the
single highest priority of any Member
of Congress, they have done so in the
worst way possible, and I will be oppos-
ing the package.
To start, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats
are proposing a package of six bills
covering the bulk of the closed agen-
cies and are proposing to fund them for
the full fiscal year. Unfortunately,
what the Democrats have done is put
up a package of six bills produced by
the Senate. If the House chooses to
pass these bills, we will be abrogating
any and all ability for the House to af-
fect the final spending package. None
of these six bills reflect any work done
by the House Appropriations Com-
mittee or the House at large, and I, for
one, do not think it wise to surrender
all ability to produce a final product
like that.
Our own priorities as a coequal house
of Congress will not be represented in
this bill, and, instead, we merely are
being given only the opportunity to
vote on what the Senate has produced.
Second, the Democrats are proposing
a continuing resolution to fund the De-
partment of Homeland Security
through February 8. This, again, is an
ill-conceived idea. It simply will kick
the can down the road on fully funding
the department through the fiscal
year. It does not provide any additional
money for border security, which
Americans have told us time and time
again that they want and need.
Most notably, this bill is part of a
package that the Senate will not pass
and the President will not sign. Why
would we surrender our authority and
our ability to produce a legislative
product on a quixotic effort that is
going nowhere?
While I appreciate the attempt by my
Democratic colleagues to reopen the
government, I do not think the pack-
age is an appropriate way to do so, and
I would encourage all of my colleagues
to oppose it.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to say
again how gratified I am that I will be
working closely with my friend from
Massachusetts during this Congress. I
have said some critical things about
the rule he is placing on the floor, but
let no one think that my disagree-
ments with him over matters of policy
or procedure reflect how I feel about
him as a person.
As he so kindly noted last week, we
can disagree without being disagree-
able. I look forward to attempting to
live up to those words as we work to-
gether in the coming 2 years. With
that, I urge opposition to the rule.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague
from Oklahoma for his kind words. My
mother and father are up in the gal-
lery, so they are very impressed that
you said nice things about me.
I am going to say nice things about
you, too, but I was saving it until the
end to see the tone of your speech. But
I appreciate very much what you said.
Let me just make a couple of state-
ments in response.
The gentleman made mention about
martial law, and, yes, there is limited
martial law or same-day authority in
this package. I am going to say to the
gentleman that there should be. If
there ever was a time to move legisla-
tion quickly, it is while nearly 800,000
Federal employees, including our law
enforcement officers, like FBI and DEA
and CBP agents, are going without a
paycheck.
Enough is enough. We need to open
the government, and same-day author-
ity for appropriations bills only lets us
do that as quickly as we are able to.
I just want to remind my friends on
the other side of the aisle that you had
blanket martial law authority before

the holidays. I even voted for the rule
providing for it. We did that so that we
could move quickly to make sure hard-
working Americans weren’t left with-
out a paycheck over Christmas.
But what did you do instead of uti-
lizing that same-day authority to con-
sider a bill to keep the government
open? That is not what you did. You
held an emergency Rules Committee
meeting on a bill to define natural
cheese. That was the priority, appar-
ently, in the Rules Committee. I mean,
seriously. This may seem like a novel
concept to my Republican friends, but
this is exactly what responsible gov-
ernance looks like.
Not having the ability to fund gov-
ernment as expeditiously as possible
and to clean up this Republican mess
would be an abdication of our duty as a
new Democratic House majority to
keep the lights on for the American
people’s government. I don’t recall—
maybe you can correct me—in history,
when we have ever started a new Con-
gress in a shutdown that was caused by
the previous Congress.
b 1630
I mean, I would have thought that
my friends would have wanted to kind
of clean things up before they left
town, but they didn’t do that. I was
here. I was on the floor trying to get
the attention of the presiding Speaker
to allow us to bring up a continuing
resolution to keep the government run-
ning, and I was routinely not recog-
nized.
I mean, this is crazy. The bills that
we are talking about were approved
overwhelmingly by either the Senate
Appropriations Committee or the en-
tire Senate. There is, like, no con-
troversy on these bills. And most of
these bills have nothing to do with bor-
der security, quite frankly. Yet, the
President of the United States is hold-
ing a big chunk of our government hos-
tage because he is having a temper tan-
trum, and it just has to stop.
So we are going to do what the Amer-
ican people want us to do. We are going
to expeditiously bring before this Con-
gress legislation to reopen the govern-
ment, and we hope to do that. I hope
my friends on the other side of the
aisle will join with us.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CAS-
TOR), the distinguished chairwoman of
the new Select Committee on the Cli-
mate Crisis.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker,
I thank my colleague, the House Rules
Chairman, JIM MCGOVERN, for crafting
a transformative rules package that we
hope will re-instill confidence of the
American people in this Congress; con-
fidence that we can address the chal-
lenges that our country faces, whether
it is opening the government, or it is
protecting our neighbors who have pre-
existing health conditions, and making
a statement about ethics in govern-
ment as a priority.
But I want to thank Chairman
MCGOVERN and Speaker PELOSI espe-
cially for re-instituting the Select
Committee on the Climate Crisis.
A few years ago, in 2007, Speaker
PELOSI instituted the Select Com-
mittee on Energy Independence and
Global Warming. When the Republicans
took over in 2010, they dismissed the
committee. They wouldn’t have hear-
ings. Meanwhile, the cost of the chang-
ing climate escalated.
I come from the State of Florida
where we are seeing enormous cost, not
even counting the extreme weather
events. This is the challenge of our
time.
So, in this rules package, the Demo-
crats will re-institute a climate change
committee called the Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis. In doing
so, we intend to press for urgent action
in defense of America and our way of
life.
We want dramatic reductions in car-
bon pollution. We want to make clean
energy a pillar of our economy and cre-
ate the green jobs of today and the fu-
ture. You see, we have a moral obliga-
tion to our children and future genera-
tions to do this.
So, again, Chairman MCGOVERN, my
Democratic colleagues, Speaker
PELOSI, thank you for listening, heed-
ing the calls of the American people.
We will tackle this challenge, and we
need your help, America.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX).
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I thank my colleague for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the stu-
dents and workers of today and tomor-
row, I rise in opposition to this rules
package.
It has become tradition in the House
that when Republicans are in the ma-
jority, we have the Committee on Edu-
cation and the Workforce, and when
the Democrats are in the majority we
have the Committee on Education and
Labor.
Some assign political motivations to
these names. They point out the old
traditional bond between organized
labor and the establishment Democrat
Party, but it is far more serious than
that. Reverting to the committee’s old
name is choosing to live in the past.
Republicans value traditions. We
value institutions, but we know we
cannot afford to go back.
Changing the committee’s name from
workforce to labor has not only polit-
ical ramifications but also reflects how
we view our fellow citizens. It sends a
message to the people we represent
that we are interested only in serving
some professions. If they don’t consider
themselves laborers, if they choose to
identify as part of another demo-
graphic or class, or if they pursue ca-
reer changes, they need not look to us.
Mr. Speaker, that should not be the
case.
Republicans on the Education and
Workforce Committee have stayed true
to key principles in this regard. We be-
lieve all education is career education.
We believe every American has God-
given talents which they should have
the freedom and opportunity to pursue,
and we believe that all work is valu-
able.
The word ‘‘labor’’ harkens back to a
time when work was little more than a
burden to carry, not a means to a
brighter future, not a manifestation of
a woman or man’s talents and skills.
No one wants to move backward. We
may have different ideas about how to
move forward, but no one should want
to turn back the clock, at least no one
on this side of the aisle.
Words matter. The name of such a vi-
tally important body as the Committee
on Education and the Workforce mat-
ters very much. We must govern with
an eye toward to the future and not be
bound to an unhealthy allegiance to
those who would keep us in the past.
For that reason, among many others,
we must oppose this rules package.
And I, too, want to give my congratu-
lations to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts, and tell him I admire him
very much for his passion and commit-
ment, and look forward to working
with him in his new capacity.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I want to thank the gentlewoman for
her kind comments, and I agree with
her that words matter. And I would
hope that she and others on the other
side of the aisle would remember that
the name of our party is the Demo-
cratic Party, not the Democrat Party,
and we would appreciate the respect of
calling us by what our real name is.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, when we de-
feat the previous question, I will offer
an amendment to the resolution.
I ask unanimous consent to insert
the text of my amendment, along with
extraneous material, in the RECORD im-
mediately prior to the vote on the pre-
vious question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma?
There was no objection.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon
(Mr. WALDEN) to explain the amend-
ment.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I come
here today with a very simple request
and in the spirit of this new Congress
and a fresh start.
Let us come together and make sure
that those Americans with preexisting
health conditions are protected, period.
Republicans have language to protect
people with preexisting health condi-
tions which we believe should be in-
cluded in this rules package. But that
can only happen if the new Democratic
majority allows it.
Let me explain why it is needed at
this time. Last year, 20 State attorneys
general filed a lawsuit against
ObamaCare arguing that the law’s indi-
vidual mandate is unconstitutional

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H13
January 3, 2019
and, therefore, the entire law is uncon-
stitutional.
On December 14 of last year, a Fed-
eral judge in Texas agreed with the
plaintiffs and issued a summary judg-
ment stating: ‘‘The individual mandate
is essential to and inseverable from the
other provisions of the ACA’’ therefore,
the judge has ruled the entire Afford-
able Care Act is unconstitutional.
It is important to note that the
judge’s decision does not immediately
end ObamaCare and will not affect the
insurance coverage or premiums for
2019. And, in fact, the judge has ordered
a stay of his earlier ruling pending ap-
peal.
Additionally, the ruling is already
being appealed by other attorneys gen-
eral from States that had intervened in
the lawsuit to defend ObamaCare, and
that means several legal steps remain
before the courts reach a final conclu-
sion where the ruling could be re-
versed.
Even though these State AGs are al-
ready intervening in the case, the
Democratic rules package includes a
provision authorizing the House Gen-
eral Counsel to also intervene in the
case. That effort does not preserve pre-
existing condition protections. The Re-
publican proposal would.
Put simply, the Texas court ruled
that ObamaCare’s individual mandate
is unconstitutional.
Now, we also know it didn’t work.
The individual mandate didn’t live up
to its promise. We were told that the
individual mandate would encourage
enrollment. In fact, the Congressional
Budget Office argued 24 million Ameri-
cans would enroll in ObamaCare by
2018, but less than half that number ac-
tually enrolled and paid for their cov-
erage. Twelve million others paid the
penalty or claimed an exemption.
Moreover, those that have signed up
have seen skyrocketing premiums and
thousands of dollars in deductibles.
Preexisting condition protections are
greatly diminished when you cannot
afford your premiums or your deduct-
ible.
Republicans have long supported pre-
existing condition protection for Amer-
icans. In fact, in 2016, our healthcare
agenda, A Better Way: Our Vision for a
Confident America, we clearly stated:
‘‘No American should ever be denied
coverage or face a coverage exclusion
on the basis of a preexisting condition.
Our plan ensures every American,
healthy or sick, will have the comfort
of knowing they can never be denied a
plan from a health insurer.’’
It was also one of my first bills as
chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee that I introduced in Feb-
ruary of 2017. It required health insur-
ers to allow every eligible applicant to
enroll in their plans, regardless of fac-
tors like health status, age, or income,
and it also prohibited benefit exclu-
sions and banned health status under-
writing.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the
gentleman an additional 30 seconds.
Mr. WALDEN. Effectively, that
would ensure these important patient
protections if ObamaCare were no
longer the law. During the floor debate
on the AHCA, the leaders of our party
made clear we supported protections
for those with preexisting conditions.
That is our position, period.
So today, we, once again, reinforce
our support of people with preexisting
conditions. Our language simply says
Congress should produce legislation
that guarantees no American citizen
can be denied health insurance cov-
erage as a result of a previous illness or
health status, and it guarantees no
American citizen can be charged higher
premiums or cost sharing as a result of
a previous illness or health status;
thus, ensuring affordable health cov-
erage for those with preexisting condi-
tions.
But we can only offer that if the
Democratic majority allows it, and we
would do so if the previous question is
defeated.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I have to be honest with you, I am al-
most speechless. I mean, the gentleman
from Oregon takes my breath away
with his previous question amendment.
I want to remind the gentleman that
it was the Democrats that actually put
in protections for people with pre-
existing conditions. We did so over the
objections of the Republicans and, for
almost a decade now, while my friends
were in charge, they, time and time
and time again tried to take away peo-
ple’s healthcare protections, including
protections for people with preexisting
conditions.
This lawsuit, this judgment in Texas
that recently came about that threat-
ens people’s healthcare protections was
filed by the Republicans. I mean, they
have been in charge of the House and
the Senate and the White House, and
they have done nothing to protect peo-
ple with preexisting conditions. They
have just tried to take these protec-
tions away.
Now, I get it. We heard loud and clear
in the last election that people don’t
agree with you. They don’t agree with
you. And we are going to do everything
we can to protect people with pre-
existing conditions and to expand
healthcare protections for everybody in
this country because we believe that
healthcare is a right and not a privi-
lege.
So when I hear my friends come here
with a procedural motion, you know,
that somehow they want to be the
champions for people who are worried
about their healthcare coverage, it is
laughable.
Mr. WALDEN. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Oregon.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman’s comments. I
don’t agree with them, obviously, but I
haven’t heard the gentleman’s objec-
tions to the language we proposed to
offer to your rules package that al-
ready has different healthcare provi-
sions in it. Is there anything here the
gentleman objects to allowing us to
offer?
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, re-
claiming my time, we are going to do
something that my friends on the other
side of the aisle did not do. We are
going to legislate in a professional and
proper manner. And as we debate
healthcare in the future, it is going to
go through regular order. We are going
to take on, immediately right now,
some of these court cases that we
think present a danger to the Amer-
ican people.
But the idea that the Republican
friends are coming to the floor saying
let’s protect people with preexisting
conditions, you know what? The Amer-
ican people don’t believe it. That was
the message in the last election. That
was the message, because they know
that dozens and dozens and dozens of
times, Republicans came to this floor,
used every trick in the book to try to
undo the Affordable Care Act and,
thankfully, you failed. And we put
these protections in place and we will
make sure they stay in place.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from the
great State of Arizona (Mr.
SCHWEIKERT).
b 1645
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman, Mr. COLE, for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I will try to do this
quickly. We are removing, in the
Democratic Party rules package, mac-
roeconomic analysis.
Now, we all know right now the
methodology used at Joint Tax, CBO.
They actually do some of it no matter
what, and they have long before it was
put into the rules years ago.
My great concern is, by the removal,
I actually think we are sort of being a
bit antimath, antiscience,
antiopenness, antifacts, because walk
through a couple examples with me.
Tomorrow we double the tax on ciga-
rettes. Do you get double the tax rev-
enue? Of course not. People stop smok-
ing.
If there is a green agenda or when we
are going to see paygo numbers, are we
allowed to do macroeconomic analysis
on that to tell us the economic effects?
In other words, policy matters, and if
we are going to engage in policy
around here that changes the economic
growth rates, that also changes tax
revenues for the positive or the nega-
tive. Should we be honest about that?
The rules package here strips the re-
quirement that, on important legisla-
tion, we get a macroeconomic analysis,
and that is my concern.
For all of us who make public policy,
we should have honest math, and we

should have math to understand the
cascade effect: What are the effects in
the economy? It is just that if we are
going to make public policy, let’s actu-
ally have the math that backs it up.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I will respond to the
gentleman.
I appreciate his point, but I just want
to remind him that, while his party
was in power, time and time and time
again, I think I have lost count of how
many bills came to this floor without a
CBO score, never mind a dynamic
score.
Serving on the Rules Committee, I
know of at least 68 bills in this last
Congress that came to the Rules Com-
mittee that never had a hearing in a
committee or a markup in a committee
of jurisdiction.
So we are going to go back to the
committee process. We are going to
make committees do their work. We
are going to require that there be hear-
ings on bills and markups on bills and
have this place behave in the manner
in which the American people expect it
to.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. CONAWAY), a distinguished gen-
tleman and my good friend.
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, both
the chairman and ranking member of
the Rules Committee have addressed,
literally, a rule tucked away on page 31
with respect to going after the Sec-
retary of Agriculture’s attempts to
change the rules with respect to SNAP.
My good colleague from Massachusetts
is a master at cloaking this issue, any
change to SNAP, as if Republicans are
beating up on poor people.
Mr. Speaker, this rule that the Sec-
retary of Agriculture is proposing mir-
rors the House requirements with re-
spect to changing waivers on SNAP
that this House passed back in June,
the House version of the farm bill.
Throughout the entire conversation I
had with our Senate colleagues on ne-
gotiating the conference report, both
the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and
Forestry chairman as well as the rank-
ing member, and particularly the rank-
ing member, the Democrat, reminded
me over and over and over that Sec-
retary Perdue had, in fact, all of the
authority he needed to do what we
wanted to do on the House bill; there-
fore, the House version was unneces-
sary and Secretary Perdue could move
this forward.
This rule addresses a-bods, able-bod-
ied adults, people between the ages of
18 and 49 without dependents. Most
folks would look at them and say that
is a worker.
Well, there is waiver abuse. Waiving
the 20-hour-a-week work requirement
has been abused by the system. I want
to point out, until last September, the
entire State of California was under
work waiver, and we have, yet, a 4 per-
cent unemployment rate across this
Nation. It makes no sense.
So what Secretary Perdue does is
say, look, if you are willing to help
yourself by working 20 hours a week,
then you will, as an a-bod, be able to
stay on food stamps, unlimited. If you
are unwilling to help yourself, dem-
onstrate that you can help yourself,
then your SNAP requirements will be
limited to 3 months out of every 36.
The impact it would have is this:
With the now famous YouTube show,
or wherever I saw it, we have a 27-year-
old surfer from California who loves to
surf—fantastic—but he doesn’t like to
work, but he is on food stamps. The
waiver of the work requirement in
California allows him to stay on food
stamps an unlimited amount of time,
and yet he doesn’t have to work.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle as well as my colleagues in
the Senate would voraciously defend
the work requirement that is currently
in law, 20 hours a week; they just don’t
want to defend it. This rule will allow
them to try to supercede and intervene
on behalf of requiring able-bodied
adults to work.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
oppose this rule and oppose the under-
lying rule package.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the
gentleman from Texas, the now rank-
ing member of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, this provision wasn’t tucked
away. In fact, we did a press release on
it. We want everybody to know that we
are going to hold this administration
accountable if they go against what
the Congress passed in the farm bill.
The Congress didn’t pass what the
gentleman just said. In fact, my friend
from Texas said in an interview last
year that the Secretary of Agriculture
doesn’t have the authority to fix waiv-
ers. Maybe he has changed his mind.
But here is the deal, and if the Sec-
retary is watching, I want to be very,
very clear: If, in fact, he or this admin-
istration go after poor people, if they
try to take away their food, if they try
to undercut their food security, we are
coming after them. We are going to
hold them accountable. The days of
turning a blind eye to attacks on poor
people are over, plain and simple.
So this is not a provision that was
tucked away. It was not a provision
that was hidden. In fact, we did a press
release on it. I want everybody to know
about it.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close if my friend is.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am
prepared to close.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to
begin again by congratulating my good
friend on assuming this very important
position of responsibility as chairman
of the House Rules Committee.
It is particularly, I think, notable
that he began his career of public serv-
ice as a staff member on this very com-
mittee. So I think moving from staff
member to ranking member and to
chairman is something my friend
should be very proud of and all of us in
the House should be proud of as well. It
says wonderful things about him.
Now, while the rules package in-
cludes some very good ideas, I am
going to urge all Members to oppose
the rule. Some of the provisions, obvi-
ously, that I mentioned in my remarks
Republicans certainly can support. It,
unfortunately, however, includes too
many measures that we cannot.
The rule today removes important
fiscal responsibility measures from the
House rules, establishes a partisan Se-
lect Committee on the Climate Crisis,
and grants the Speaker the power to
intervene in a lawsuit over the legality
of the ACA.
It also makes in order an appropria-
tions package, frankly, as an appropri-
ator, I cannot support. The idea that
the House would simply yield to the
Senate and accept, without change,
bills that the Senate has passed even
though, frankly, there had been ongo-
ing conferences and many changes have
been agreed to is something that I
think we should never do in this par-
ticular body.
For these and the reasons I have dis-
cussed here, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the
rule.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ on the
previous question, a ‘‘no’’ on the under-
lying measure, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate
the new ranking member of the Rules
Committee, Mr. COLE. It has been a
pleasure to be down here debating with
him here today.
It is kind of strange to close debate.
I kind of like it. I haven’t been able to
do it for a long time.
We have worked side by side on this
committee for many years. We have
also worked in Congress on a lot of im-
portant issues that we both care about,
like the Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force. I appreciate his work on
the Appropriations Committee. I think
nobody knows more about the appro-
priations process or respects that proc-
ess more than the gentleman from
Oklahoma.
Mr. Speaker, he is not only a col-
league, but I consider him a friend. We
don’t agree on everything, but when we
disagree, Congressman COLE is always
very respectful. As I said before, he dis-
agrees without being disagreeable, and
all while still fighting for the ideas and
issues that he cares deeply about.
Frankly, in this day and age, that is a
breath of fresh air, and I look forward
to continuing to work with him on the
committee in this Congress. I expect
that we will be able to forge a relation-
ship and, hopefully, be able to do
things differently. That is my hope.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H15
January 3, 2019
Now, Mr. Speaker, these rules that
are contained in the rules package are
historic. There has never been a proc-
ess like this one before, and there has
never been a rules package like this be-
fore. It is unprecedented.
Our Speaker, who I am proud to have
just elected, tasked me with soliciting
Members’ feedback for this rules pack-
age months ago, and working with the
members of our committee, we did just
that.
Mr. Speaker, I thank her again for
the opportunity. I think her leadership
on this has been extraordinary. She has
empowered all of our Members to get
involved, and she has led a collabo-
rative process that gave all Members a
voice.
These changes incorporate ideas from
every corner of our Caucus. As I said
before, there are many ideas that have
come from Republicans as well, and
they come from Members that rep-
resent urban areas and suburban areas
and rural areas.
I am a progressive. I am a liberal. My
colleagues on the other side know that.
There are changes here that we have
been fighting for for years.
I know my Republican colleagues
wouldn’t have included some of these
priorities, like healthcare and climate
change, if they were drafting their own
package, and that is okay. I get it.
The American people have entrusted
Democrats to run this institution, and
so this is a rules package the majority
should be proud to support; but I hope
some of my friends in the minority will
as well, because there are major re-
forms to the legislative process that
even they agree should be made.
There is a bipartisan agreement that
we need to change how this place is
run. This is our chance. On day one of
this Congress, let’s vote for this rule
and the underlying rules package and
for measures ending the Trump shut-
down so we can get the American peo-
ple who have been displaced back to
work and get them a paycheck and give
them the kind of Congress that they
have demanded.
Mr. Speaker, the reason why I also
think this deserves bipartisan support
is because we are trying, in good faith,
to have a more accommodating Rules
Committee, to have a more accommo-
dating process.
In the previous Congress, which un-
fortunately went down in history as
the most closed Congress in American
history, Members on both sides—not
just Democrats, but Republicans—were
routinely shut out. And I know my col-
league from Oklahoma didn’t always
approve of that tactic, but the bottom
line is that was the fact, and I think
that needs to change.
We need to be willing on our side to
allow ideas that we may have issues
with, that we may disagree with. You
don’t always have to rig the rules in
order to get the end product you want.
So I believe in a fair fight. We believe
that important ideas, even ideas we
disagree with, ought to be brought to
the floor. When we disagree with them,
we are going to fight and try to defeat
them on the floor. But out of respect
and out of the belief that everybody in
this Chamber matters, we need to
change the way we have done business.
So in that spirit, I ask the Members
of this House, both Democrats and Re-
publicans, to vote on this rule and sup-
port the underlying rules package.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. COLE is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO H. RES. 5 OFFERED BY MR.
COLE, MR. WALDEN, AND MR. BRADY OF TEXAS
SEC. lll. PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.
Not later than January 31, 2019, the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce and the
Committee on Ways and Means shall report
to the House a joint resolution that is con-
sistent with the United States Constitution
and relevant Supreme Court cases that—
(1) guarantees no American citizen can be
denied health insurance coverage as the re-
sult of a previous illness or health status;
and
(2) guarantees no American citizen can be
charged higher premiums or cost sharing as
the result of a previous illness or health sta-
tus, thus ensuring affordable health coverage
for those with pre-existing conditions.
(The information contained herein was pro-
vided by Democratic Minority on multiple
occasions throughout the 115th Congress.
Only political affiliation has been
changed.)
THE VOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION: WHAT
IT REALLY MEANS
This vote, the vote on whether to order the
previous question on a special rule, is not
merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-
dering the previous question is a vote
against the Democratic majority agenda and
a vote to allow the opposition, at least for
the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It
is a vote about what the House should be de-
bating.
Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the
House of Representatives, (VI, 308–311) de-
scribes the vote on the previous question on
the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the
consideration of the subject before the House
being made by the Member in charge.’’ To
defeat the previous question is to give the
opposition a chance to decide the subject be-
fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s
ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that
‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-
mand for the previous question passes the
control of the resolution to the opposition’’
in order to offer an amendment. On March
15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-
fered a rule resolution. The House defeated
the previous question and a member of the
opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,
asking who was entitled to recognition.
Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:
‘‘The previous question having been refused,
the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-
gerald, who had asked the gentleman to
yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to
the first recognition.’’
The Democrat majority may say ‘‘the vote
on the previous question is simply a vote on
whether to proceed to an immediate vote on
adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no
substantive legislative or policy implica-
tions whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they
have always said. Listen to the Republican
Leadership Manual on the Legislative Proc-
ess in the United States House of Represent-
atives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the
Republicans describe the previous question
vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is
generally not possible to amend the rule be-
cause the majority Member controlling the
time will not yield for the purpose of offering
an amendment, the same result may be
achieved by voting down the previous ques-
tion on the rule . . . When the motion for the
previous question is defeated, control of the
time passes to the Member who led the oppo-
sition to ordering the previous question.
That Member, because he then controls the
time, may offer an amendment to the rule,
or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’
In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House
of Representatives, the subchapter titled
‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal
to order the previous question on such a rule
[a special rule reported from the Committee
on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-
ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-
tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejec-
tion of the motion for the previous question
on a resolution reported from the Committee
on Rules, control shifts to the Member lead-
ing the opposition to the previous question,
who may offer a proper amendment or mo-
tion and who controls the time for debate
thereon.
Clearly, the vote on the previous question
on a rule does have substantive policy impli-
cations. It is one of the only available tools
for those who oppose the Democratic major-
ity’s agenda and allows those with alter-
native views the opportunity to offer an al-
ternative plan.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time, and I
move the previous question on the res-
olution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 233, nays
197, not voting 2, as follows:

TITLE III—INTERVENTION IN LITIGATION
INVOLVING PATIENT PROTECTION AND
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
SEC. 301. FINDINGS.
The House of Representatives finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) Texas, Wisconsin, Alabama, Arkansas,
Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas,
Louisiana, Governor Paul LePage of Maine,
Mississippi (by and through Governor Phil
Bryant), Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,
Utah, and West Virginia have filed suit in
the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Texas, arguing that the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Public Law 111–148; 124 Stat. 119) is uncon-
stitutional and should be enjoined by assert-
ing that the Act’s requirement to maintain
minimum essential coverage (commonly
known as the ‘‘individual responsibility pro-
vision’’) in section 5000A(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, is unconstitutional fol-
lowing the amendment of that provision by
the Act to provide for reconciliation pursu-
ant to titles II and V of the concurrent reso-
lution on the budget for fiscal year 2018
(Public Law 115–97) (commonly known as the
‘‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’’).
(2) These State and individual plaintiffs
also seek to strike down the entire Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act as not
severable from the individual responsibility
provision.
(3) On June 7, 2018, the Department of Jus-
tice refused to defend the constitutionality
of the amended individual responsibility pro-
vision, despite the well-established duty of
the Department to defend Federal statutes
where reasonable arguments can be made in
their defense.
(4) The Department of Justice not only re-
fused to defend the amended individual re-
sponsibility provision, but affirmatively ar-
gued that this provision is unconstitutional
and that the provisions of the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act guaran-
teeing issuance of health insurance coverage
regardless of health status or preexisting
conditions (commonly known as the ‘‘guar-
anteed issue provision’’) found in sections
2702, 2704, and 2705(a) of the Public Health
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–
4(a)) and prohibitions on discriminatory pre-
mium rates (commonly known as the ‘‘com-
munity rating provision’’) found in sections
2701 and 2705(b) of the Public Health Service
Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg(a)(1), 300gg–4(b)) must
now be struck down as not severable from
the individual responsibility provision.
(5) The district court recently held that
the individual responsibility provision is un-
constitutional and that all of the remaining
provisions of the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care act are inseverable and there-
fore invalid.
(6) Up to 133 million nonelderly Americans
have some type of preexisting health condi-
tion, such as, but not limited to, diabetes,
high cholesterol, cancer, arthritis, and asth-
ma, that could affect their insurance.
(7) Prior to the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act and the enactment of pro-
tections such as guaranteed issue and com-
munity rating, millions of Americans were
denied health insurance coverage, were un-
able to obtain coverage of necessary medical
services, or were priced out of the individual
market due to preexisting conditions.
(8) Without such protections for pre-
existing conditions, millions of Americans
could once again lose access to affordable,
comprehensive health insurance.
(9) More than 13 million Americans who
gained coverage in States that expanded
Medicaid eligibility under the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act could lose
coverage if the Act were struck down in its
entirety.
(10) More than 2 million young adults who
gained coverage under a provision of the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care Act al-
lowing individuals under the age of 26 to stay
on their parents’ insurance could lose cov-
erage if the Act were struck down in its en-
tirety.
(11) More than 8.9 million low and middle-
income Americans who received tax credits
averaging $520 per month to help pay for

health insurance in the individual market
under the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act could lose coverage if the Act were
struck down in its entirety.
(12) An estimated 105 million Americans
who now enjoy coverage without lifetime
limits due to the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act could once again face life-
time limits on their benefits if the Act were
struck down in its entirety.
(13) Nearly 12 million Medicare bene-
ficiaries who received an average of $2,200 in
savings on prescription drugs due to the clos-
ing of the Medicare prescription drug donut
hole under the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act would face rising drug
costs if the Act were struck down in its en-
tirety.
SEC. 302. AUTHORIZING LEGAL ACTION BY
HOUSE.
(a) AUTHORIZATION.—The Speaker, on be-
half of the House of Representatives, is au-
thorized to intervene, otherwise appear, or
take any other steps in the case of Texas v.
United States, No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.)
and in any appellate proceedings arising
from such case. The Speaker, in consultation
with the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, is
also authorized to intervene, otherwise ap-
pear, or take any other steps in any other
cases involving the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act to protect the institu-
tional interests of the House and to defend
such Act, the amendments made by such Act
to other provisions of law, and any amend-
ments to such provisions, including the pro-
visions ensuring affordable health coverage
for those with preexisting conditions.
(b) ROLE OF GENERAL COUNSEL.—The Office
of General Counsel of the House of Rep-
resentatives, at the direction of the Speaker,
shall represent the House in any litigation
pursuant to this title. The Office of General
Counsel may employ the services of outside
counsel, including pro bono counsel, or other
experts for this purpose.
(c) REPORTS ON AMOUNTS EXPENDED.—The
chair of the Committee on House Adminis-
tration shall cause to be printed in the Con-
gressional Record a statement setting forth
the aggregate amounts expended by the Of-
fice of General Counsel on outside counsel
and other experts pursuant to this title on a
quarterly basis, and such statement shall be
submitted for printing not more than 30 days
after the expiration of each such quarter.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 5, the question
shall be divided among each of the
three titles of House Resolution 6. The
previous question is ordered on each
portion of the divided question, except
as specified in sections 2 and 3 of House
Resolution 5.
The portion of the divided question
comprising title I is now debatable for
30 minutes.
The gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
HOYER) and the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY) each will con-
trol 15 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, this rules package was
developed under the leadership of
Chairman MCGOVERN and Democrats
on the Rules Committee, but shaped by
the voices of millions of Americans
who want to see change in Washington.
Elections, of course, have con-
sequences, and today Americans will
see the first changes that are the result
of entrusting Democrats with a major-
ity in the House.
This rules package will restore power
to the American people in five critical
ways:
A, restoring the people’s voices;
B, fixing the legislative process;
C, improving oversight and ethics;
D, imposing commonsense budget
rules; and
E, promoting inclusion and diversity.
We will seek to restore the people’s
voices, Mr. Speaker, in a number of
ways. The first is by bringing H.R. 1 to
the floor early in this new Congress,
legislation that will begin to undo the
corrupting influence of undisclosed
money in our politics.
I want to thank my colleague from
Maryland, Congressman JOHN SAR-
BANES, for his tireless efforts on that
bill and look forward to bringing it to
the floor.
Next, Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES
NORTON from the District of Columbia,
the Resident Commissioner from Puer-
to Rico, and Delegates in the terri-
tories will once again be permitted to
vote on amendments and help shape
legislation as they seek to add the
voices of millions of people they rep-
resent.
We will also end the practice of al-
lowing appropriations bills to target
hardworking Federal employees by cut-
ting individual salaries, programs, or
office sizes.
In fixing the broken legislative proc-
ess, Mr. Speaker, Democrats will re-
store regular order to the House.
Our new rules package will make it
harder to throw the House into par-
tisan chaos, and it includes new meas-
ures that facilitate bipartisanship, in-
cluding by making it easier to force a
vote on legislation supported by a ma-
jority of Members.
Our rules improve oversight and eth-
ics in several ways, including, for ex-
ample, by making it easier for staff to
report harassment, and close remain-
ing loopholes allowing conflicts of in-
terest.
b 1815
Also, Mr. Speaker, no longer will
Members or staff be allowed to serve on
corporate boards, giving rise to con-
flicts of interest.
Democrats will return to common-
sense budget practices, such as elimi-
nating Republicans’ use of dynamic
scoring and reinstating the Gephardt
rule to prevent the default on our debt.
The rules package, Mr. Speaker, also
takes a step toward restoring paygo,
which ensures that Congress has to pay
for what it buys.
Additionally, our rules package pro-
motes diversity and inclusion by spe-
cifically banning discrimination
against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgender Members and staff, as well
as ensuring that Members and staff
who wear religious head coverings can
do so on the House floor without im-
pediment. We also are creating an inde-
pendent diversity office to help Mem-
bers hire qualified staff who reflect the
broad and diverse range of the con-
stituents that we represent.
Mr. Speaker, this rules package sig-
nals a new start for the House. We will
go from the most closed Congress in
history to a period when Americans fi-
nally have a House that is on their
side. With these rules, Mr. Speaker, we
will make government work again for
those it serves. Hopefully, Mr. Speaker,
they will also facilitate a process that
will not close down the people’s gov-
ernment.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise as the designee of
the Republican leader, and I thank my
good friend, the majority leader, for
yielding me 15 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, a couple of hours ago,
we had a spirited debate that also re-
flected the way I hope both sides pro-
ceed and intend to approach the next 2
years: disagreeing without being dis-
agreeable. In that respect, today rep-
resents a good start for the new Con-
gress.
Mr. Speaker, earlier today, I had an
opportunity to speak on the rules
package my Democratic friends are
proposing for the 116th Congress. I laid
out most of what I had to say then, but
I want to reiterate a few key points.
First, while, on the whole, I will be
opposing this package, I do want to
commend my friends for including
some good bipartisan pieces that Re-
publicans certainly can support. We
support, for example, continuing the
practice of Member Day hearings. We
support the idea of a Select Committee
on the Modernization of Congress,
which we will discuss in more detail to-
morrow. We are hopeful about other
measures, such as the 72-hour rule for
posting bill text and the proposed Con-
sensus Calendar. We look forward to
seeing how these proposals work in
practice.
Of course, my Democratic friends are
also proposing a number of measures
that we oppose. They are removing key
fiscal responsibility measures like
CutGo, the supermajority for raising
income taxes; bringing back the so-
called Gephardt rule; and deeming the
debt limit to be suspended upon pas-
sage of a new budget by only the
House. These changes will undoubtedly
lead to more spending, more taxes, and
more debt being piled on the American
people.
We also oppose the granting of the
Speaker the authority to intervene in
the Texas v. United States lawsuit over
the legality of the Affordable Care Act
and the unspecified grant of authority
to do something, anything, about regu-
lations that the Department of Agri-
culture has not yet issued on SNAP
benefits for able-bodied adults. Most
notably, we oppose the new partisan
Select Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis with a supermajority of Democrats,
in contrast to the agreed upon ratio on

other committees, and unclear funding
and costs.
While I continue to hope that, on our
side, we proceed appropriately, I do not
believe this rules package represents
the best way to govern this institution.
The Democrats have chosen today to
increase spending, add a partisan select
committee to the institution, and pave
the way to pass tax and spend legisla-
tion. I do not believe these rules meet
the lofty goals we aspire to meet of
transparency, bipartisanship, and en-
suring minority views are heard.
For these reasons, and for others that
I stated earlier today, I urge opposition
to the measure.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, while I regret that the
gentleman opposes the rule, I appre-
ciate his bipartisanship and his hope,
which I share, that we will proceed in
a fashion that will make the American
people proud. Very frankly, we can be
proud of ourselves for accomplishing
that which the American people want
accomplished.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend
from Massachusetts, Mr. JIM MCGOV-
ERN, the chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee, to complete our side of the ar-
gument. He has done such an extraor-
dinary job in putting these rules to-
gether.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume,
and I thank the majority leader for
yielding me the time.
Mr. Speaker, a rules package may
seem like some arcane technicality, a
simple legislative move on the opening
day of a Congress, but it is really much
more than that. This is our first oppor-
tunity to declare what kind of institu-
tion this House will be. I am proud
that, through collaboration and con-
versation, we have drafted a rules
package that boldly declares that it is
a new day for Congress.
This package reflects the diversity of
our new majority. Ideas are included
here from Members that represent
urban and rural parts of the country,
longtime leaders and those who have
taken the oath of office for the very
first time today. We come from dif-
ferent backgrounds and have been
elected here on different platforms.
But each of us shares the same goal:
making this place work again, not just
function better legislatively, though
that is important, but also respond
more urgently to the needs of the peo-
ple that we represent.
That is why this rules package sets
up consideration of H.R. 1, historic re-
forms to clean up money in politics. It
creates the Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis. It strengthens represen-
tation by giving voting rights to Dele-
gates and the Resident Commissioner
in the Committee of the Whole and en-
sures that they can be appointed to
joint committees. It prohibits Members
and staff from serving on boards of
publicly traded companies. It elimi-
nates CutGo and creates the first ever
diversity office. I can go on and on and
on.
This rules package isn’t some totally
partisan document. It includes ideas
from my friends on the other side of
the aisle, too, because when I said at
the start of this process that I wanted
to hear from all Members, I meant it.
Good ideas were included here regard-
less of what side of the aisle they come
from. Changes like creating a Con-
sensus Calendar to move ideas with
broad support more quickly to the
floor, reforming the motion to vacate
the Chair, and striking the 3-day rule
for committee markups are here be-
cause we took such a collaborative ap-
proach, and this package is stronger
for it.
Make no mistake, no one abandoned
their principles. I am a progressive,
and I know the Republican minority
would never agree with me on prior-
ities like healthcare or the environ-
ment. There are things here I know
they wouldn’t put in their own pack-
age. But in talking to each other to see
where we agreed, there was actually
agreement on many legislative re-
forms.
I know that there are many Members
here who will think of more ideas for
how to improve this place, and I want
to hear them, and our leadership does,
too. That is why we are creating a
truly bipartisan Select Committee on
Modernizing Congress, so our efforts
don’t stop here today. These conversa-
tions can continue, and good ideas can
keep moving forward.
There has never been a process like
this to develop a rules package. This
has been unprecedented, and we have a
historic set of reforms here as a result.
They send a signal to the American
people and Members here that the 116th
Congress will be different, that it is a
new era, that we are abandoning proce-
dures that didn’t work, and we are
adopting new ideas.
This Democratic majority is giving
all Members a voice. We are listening
to the American people, and we are
holding this administration account-
able. This will be a more accommo-
dating institution as a result, a more
responsive House and a place that
looks more like the real world.
That is what is at the heart of what
we are debating. Right here, on day
one, we have a chance to vote to be a
different kind of Congress, one that
turns the page on the past and charts a
new course.
The American people demanded a
new direction by a 10 million vote mar-
gin. I know my colleagues in the ma-
jority want to see one, too, and even
some of my Republican friends ac-
knowledge that something has to
change, so this is our chance. I strong-
ly urge my colleagues to take this op-
portunity. Let’s vote for this rules
package and give Members and the
American people the Congress that
they deserve.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK),
my good friend.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H. Res. 6. I appreciate the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
MCGOVERN) and the new majority lead-
ership including items of budget proc-
ess reform in this package, to include
eliminating term limits for the House
Budget Committee members. There are
other things that we did, as a joint bi-
partisan committee, and tried to get
across the finish line but were unable
to do so. Perhaps we can work on some
of those.
Mr. Speaker, for the few bright spots
that H. Res. 6 has, they in no way
make up for the shortcomings. This
package does not rise to fiscal respon-
sibility.
First, it includes a new iteration of
the Gephardt rule, which has been spo-
ken about, that makes increasing the
debt limit even easier by automati-
cally passing debt limit increases with-
out separate debate and vote.
The package also replaces the exist-
ing budget enforcement rule known as
CutGo with a paygo rule that was in
place when Democrats passed many
programs in the past, like ObamaCare,
that added to our country’s debt bur-
den. To be clear, paygo does not en-
courage fiscal discipline under a Demo-
cratic majority.
Finally, Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 6 re-
duces the threshold for passage of in-
come tax increases on hardworking
Americans from three-fifths to a sim-
ple majority vote. I am not surprised
that the first step that the Democrats
take in this process is surrendering the
obligation to approve increases to the
debt and enacting rules that make it
easier to borrow and raise taxes.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote against this rules package.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, in response to the gen-
tleman, we had a CBS News report
posted today that the U.S. Treasury
shows that the national debt ended in
2018 more than $2 trillion larger than
on the day President Trump took of-
fice.
With all due respect to my friends on
the other side of the aisle, your CutGo
didn’t work. It is a sham. What the ma-
jority presided over are record-break-
ing deficits, increases in the deficit and
in the debt, so I think we need to take
a very different approach.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
a section-by-section analysis of the
changes H. Res. 6 will make to the
standing rules of the 115th Congress
and the separate orders taking effect
for the 116th Congress.

H. RES. 6
ADOPTING THE RULES FOR THE 116TH
CONGRESS
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
TITLE I. RULES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
SIXTEENTH CONGRESS
Section 101. Adoption of the Rules of the One
Hundred Fifteenth Congress.
This section provides that the Rules of the
115th Congress are the Rules of the 116th
Congress, except for the amendments con-
tained in section 102 of the resolution and or-
ders contained in the resolution.
Section 102. Changes to the Standing Rules.
Notification of Convening of the House.
Subsection (a) clarifies that Delegates and
the Resident Commissioner must be notified
of action regarding the convening of the
House pursuant to clause 12 of rule I.
Voting by Delegates and the Resident
Commissioner in the Committee of the
Whole. Subsection (b) extends the same pow-
ers and privileges of Members to Delegates
and the Resident Commissioner when in the
Committee of the Whole. The subsection also
provides that any recorded vote in the Com-
mittee of the Whole, decided within a margin
where the Delegates and the Resident Com-
missioner may have had a decisive impact on
the final outcome of the vote, will be re-con-
ducted in the House.
Allowing Delegates and the Resident Com-
missioner to Serve on Joint Committees.
Subsection (c) provides that Delegates and
the Resident Commissioner may serve on
joint committees.
Admittance to the Hall of the House. Sub-
section (d) adds Delegates-elect, the Resi-
dent Commissioner-elect, contestants in
elections for Delegate or the Resident Com-
missioner, and Governors of the Territories
to the list of people who are permitted in the
Hall of the House.
Office of Speaker. Subsection (e) amends
rule IX to provide that a resolution causing
a vacancy in the Office of Speaker shall be
privileged if offered at the direction of a
party caucus or conference. This change does
not otherwise alter the application of rule IX
to privileged resolutions. A resolution caus-
ing a vacancy in the Office of Speaker of-
fered at the direction of a party caucus or
conference remains subject to the notice and
debate procedures in clause 2(a) of rule IX.
This change does not apply to a resolution
reported as privileged by the Committee on
Ethics pursuant to clause 5(a)(5) of rule XIII.
Designating Committee on Oversight and
Reform. Subsection (f) changes the name of
the Committee on Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform to the Committee on Oversight
and Reform.
Designating Committee on Education and
Labor. Subsection (g) changes the name of
the Committee on Education and the Work-
force back to the Committee on Education
and Labor.
Education and Labor Jurisdiction Clari-
fication. Subsection (h) clarifies that the
Committee on Education and Labor’s juris-
diction includes the general management of
the Department of Education and the gen-
eral management of the Department of
Labor. This change is intended to clarify the
Committee’s existing jurisdiction over the
organization and administration of the de-
partments, and it not intended to alter juris-
diction over programs within the depart-
ments.
Committee Oversight Plans. Subsection (i)
amends the requirements for committee
oversight plans. The subsection requires the
chair of each standing committee (with the
exception of the Committees on Appropria-
tions, Ethics, and Rules), in consultation
with the ranking minority member, to pre-
pare and submit an oversight plan to the
Committees on House Administration and
Oversight and Reform by March 1 of the first
session of a Congress. Finally, the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform, in con-
sultation with House leadership of both par-
ties, is required to submit the oversight
plans to the House by April 15th of the first
session of a Congress with any recommenda-
tion it has for the effective coordination of
oversight plans.
The subsection favors the standard of pre-
vious Congresses over the 115th Congress, re-
quiring an oversight plan as opposed to the
115th Congress’s new authorization and over-
sight plan. The March 1st submission dead-
line is an extension from the prior February
15th deadline. The subsection also replaces
the requirement for a committee meeting on
the plan with a requirement that the chair
consult with the ranking minority member,
make the plan available to each member of
the committee for at least seven calendar
days, and include any committee member’s
views received before the submission dead-
line. This subsection also modifies which
committees will initially receive these plans,
removing the Committee on Appropriations.
Finally, the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form’s April 15th submission deadline to the
House is in line with the subsection’s new
timeline.
Activity Reports. Subsection (j) amends
language in clauses 1(d)(2)(B) and 1(d)(2)(C) of
Rule XI referencing authorization and over-
sight plans to conform with the changes de-
scribed in subsection (i).
Oversight Over the Executive Office of the
President. Subsection (k) clarifies the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform’s existing
special oversight authority over all oper-
ations of government.
Oversight and Reform Committee Deposi-
tions. Subsection (I) removes the require-
ment that Members be present during coun-
sel-led depositions, returning to the standard
of the 111th Congress.
Removing Certain Committee Term Lim-
its. Subsection (m) removes term limits for
committee chairs as well as members of the
Committee on the Budget.
Rules of Committees. Subsection (n) ex-
tends the deadline for committees to make
their rules available to the public from 30
days to 60 days after the chair’s election at
the beginning of a Congress. This change is
intended to grant committees adequate time
to organize, as some committees do not have
a full complement of members at the start of
a Congress.
Committee Markup Notice. Subsection (o)
modifies the three-day notification require-
ment for committee markups by specifying
that Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays,
except when the House is in session, do not
count toward fulfillment of the notification
requirement.
Annual Ethics Training. Subsection (p) ex-
tends the annual ethics training requirement
to all Members, Delegates, and the Resident
Commissioner. The previous rule required
new Members, Delegates, and Resident Com-
missioner to attend ethics training, and staff
to attend ethics training annually.
Considering Criminal Trial Evidence in
Ethics Investigation. Subsection (q) author-
izes the Committee on Ethics to consider as
evidence the transcripts and exhibits from
trial where a Member, Delegate, or the Resi-
dent Commissioner was convicted by a court
of record for a crime related to the subject of
the investigation by the Committee on Eth-
ics.
Consensus Calendar. Subsection (r) creates
a Consensus Calendar, and mandates that
the Speaker must designate, and the House
must consider, at least one measure on the
Consensus Calendar during any week in
which the House convenes (except at the be-
ginning and the end of a Congress). The des-
ignation is accomplished via an announce-
ment from the chair immediately prior to a
measure’s consideration. Measures may be
considered in any manner otherwise avail-
able under the rules to satisfy this require-
ment.
This subsection also provides that, to be
eligible for placement on the Consensus Cal-
endar, a measure must accumulate 290 co-
sponsors, and must not have been reported
by its primary committee of jurisdiction.
Once this cosponsorship threshold is reached
the sponsor of the measure may, while the
House is in session, submit to the Clerk a
written motion to place the measure on the
Consensus Calendar. If the above-mentioned
conditions have been met, the Clerk will
note the motion’s submission in the Congres-
sional Record of that day, and enter the mo-
tion on a comprehensive list of Consensus
Calendar Motions (which will be viewable on
the Clerk’s website). Once a measure that
was the subject of a properly filed motion
has maintained 290 cosponsors for a cumu-
lative total of 25 legislative days, it is placed
on the Consensus Calendar, where it remains
until it is considered in the House or re-
ported by its primary committee. The 25–leg-
islative day count begins on the legislative
day after a proper motion is filed, and the re-
quired 25 legislative days need not run con-
tiguously to be counted. Any day on which
the measure has less than 290 cosponsors
shall not count towards the 25-day cumu-
lative total. A Consensus Calendar motion is
considered withdrawn if the measure that is
the subject of such motion is reported by its
primary committee before the measure has
been placed on the Consensus Calendar. How-
ever, once the measure has been placed on
the Consensus’ Calendar it remains there
even if it falls below 290 cosponsors after
such placement.
Recorded Votes in Rules Committee Re-
ports. Subsection (s) provides that the re-
quirement for recorded votes to be depicted
in committee reports applies to reports from
the Committee on Rules on a rule, joint rule,
or the order of business only to the max-
imum extent practicable, due to the con-
stricted timeframe under which such reports
are prepared and filed. This change is in-
tended to ensure special rules—and thus the
floor schedule—cannot be delayed due to a
typographical error in the recorded votes de-
piction.
72-Hour Text Availability. Subsection (t)
requires that legislative text be made pub-
licly available for a full 72 hours before it is
considered in the House. Previously, legisla-
tive text could not be considered before ‘‘the
third day’’ on which it had been available to
Members, Delegates, and the Resident Com-
missioner. The new 72-hour availability re-
quirement would apply to the same types of
text to which the former three-day avail-
ability rules applied: reports accompanying
measures or matters (clause 4(a)(1) of rule
XIII); unreported bills and joint resolutions
(clause 11 of rule XXI); conference reports
(clause 8(a)(1)(A) of rule XXII); and amend-
ments reported from conference in disagree-
ment (clause 8(b)(1)(A) of rule XXII). In all
cases, the 72-hour clock would begin to run
at the time that the relevant text is made
available electronically. The additional lan-
guage inserted in clause 4(a)(1) of rule XIII
regarding the proposed text of a report is in-
tended to ensure that, in the case of reports,
the 72-hour clock will begin to run at the
time the proposed content of a report (other
than any supplemental, minority, additional,
or dissenting views described in clause 2(1) of
rule XI) is made available electronically. It
is important to note that the 72-hour avail-
ability period for a committee report is cal-
culated differently than the two-day period

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H27
January 3, 2019
for filing supplemental, minority, additional,
or dissenting views. As a result, there is the
potential that the two periods could conflict
if proposed report text is made available
prior to the filing of the report. Therefore,
any committee making the report available
electronically must also make any such
views available electronically promptly after
they are submitted to the committee to
avoid the possibility that the House would
consider a measure prior to the availability
of the complete accompanying report.
Macroeconomic Analysis. Subsection (u)
removes the requirement that the Congres-
sional Budget Office and Joint Committee on
Taxation make assumptions, to the extent
practicable, regarding changes in macro-
economic variables (often called ‘‘dynamic
scoring’’) when preparing estimates on the
budgetary effects of major legislation.
Discharge Petitions. Subsection (v)
amends the discharge petition process. The
subsection expands the number of days on
which motions to discharge, following a per-
fected discharge petition, may be considered
by removing the provision that currently re-
stricts motions to discharge to the second
and fourth Mondays of a month. Instead, the
subsection requires the Speaker to schedule
the consideration of a privileged motion to
discharge within two legislative days after
the day on which a Member who signed the
discharge petition announces to the House
an intention to offer a motion to discharge.
A motion to discharge may only be called up
by the Member who gave notice under this
rule.
Private Calendar. Subsection (w) expands
the availability of the discretionary call of
the Private Calendar beyond the third Tues-
day of a month, permitting the Speaker or a
designee to call up eligible private measures
on any day with sufficient notice. The sub-
section requires the measure to have been on
the Private Calendar for at least seven days,
after which the Speaker or a designee may
announce to the House an intention to call
up the measure. That measure then may be
called up two legislative days after the legis-
lative day on which the announcement is
made, after the disposal of such business on
the Speaker’s table as requires reference
only. The level of specificity in timing is in-
tended to ensure that the Official Objectors
are able to be on the Floor at the appro-
priate day and time.
Religious Headdress. Subsection (x) clari-
fies and maintains the existing prohibition
on wearing hats in the Hall of the House,
while making express that this prohibition
does not include religious headwear. The lan-
guage for this clarification is modeled on the
statutory provision providing for proper de-
corum during the Pledge of Allegiance, 4
U.S.C. 4.
Quorum in the Committee of the Whole.
Subsection (y) clarifies that Delegates and
the Resident Commissioner count when es-
tablishing a quorum in the Committee of the
Whole and when determining if the requisite
number are present to request a recorded
vote therein. The subsection also instructs
the Chair to include Delegates and the Resi-
dent Commissioner when determining if
Members are provided adequate opportunity
to vote. This change conforms clause 6 of
rule XVIII to the changes made to the House
rules in subsection (b).
Two-Minute Voting in the Committee of
the Whole. Subsection (z) provides the Chair
of the Committee of the Whole with addi-
tional discretion to reduce votes to two min-
utes, if in the discretion of the Chair Mem-
bers, Delegates, and the Resident Commis-
sioner would be afforded an adequate oppor-
tunity to vote.
Postponability of Certain Votes. Sub-
section (aa) provides that any vote on an
amendment in the House is postponable, as
is a vote on ordering the previous question
thereon.
Discretion for Five-Minute Votes. Sub-
section (bb) provides the Speaker with addi-
tional discretion to reduce votes to 5 min-
utes, if in the discretion of the Speaker
Members would be afforded an adequate op-
portunity to vote.
Net Increase in Budget Authority. Sub-
section (cc) removes the point of order pro-
hibiting amendments to general appropria-
tion bills that propose a net increase in the
level of budget authority in a bill. This will
allow amendments that increase spending
without offsetting that increase, so long as
the amendment does not cause the bill to ex-
ceed 302(a) or 302(b) budget allocations.
Removing Supermajority Vote. Subsection
(dd) removes the requirement that the House
agree by at least a 3/5 supermajority in order
to raise revenue through additional Federal
income taxes. The subsection also removes
the requirement that any such measure re-
ceives an automatic record vote, and pro-
vides a technical fix to a cross-reference in
clause 5(a)(2) of rule XXI.
Pay-As-You-Go Point of Order. Subsection
(ee) reinstates the PAYGO rule from the
111th Congress, with changes to conform
with the recent practice of tying the meas-
urement timeline to the calendar year, rath-
er than the last completed budget resolution.
As in the 111th Congress, this provision es-
tablishes a point of order against any meas-
ure that has a net effect of increasing the
deficit or reducing the surplus for the cur-
rent fiscal year, the budget year, and up to
nine fiscal years following that budget year.
The subsection stipulates that the net budg-
etary effects of a measure will be determined
by the non-partisan Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) but provides that if a measure is
considered pursuant to a special order that
instructs the Clerk of the House to add the
measure to another measure passed by the
House, then the net budgetary effects of the
entire package will be considered. Finally,
the subsection provides for exemptions,
given an emergency designation.
Banning Discrimination on the Basis of
Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity. Sub-
section (ff) adds to the Code of Official Con-
duct a prohibition on discrimination by any
Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner,
officer, or employee of the House on the
basis of sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity.
Banning Sexual Relationships Between
Members and Committee Staff. Subsection
(gg) extends the prohibition on sexual rela-
tionships between members (including Dele-
gates and the Resident Commissioner) and
their employees to include members who
serve on a committee on which a staffer
works, even if that staffer is not his or her
direct employee.
Service of Indicted Members in Leadership
and on Committees. Subsection (hh) adds to
the Code of Official Conduct the standard
that a Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner who has been indicted or formally
charged with criminal conduct for a felony
offense punishable by at least two years in
prison should resign from any committee on
which he or she serves, and step aside from
any party caucus or conference leadership
position the Member, Delegate, or Resident
Commissioner holds, until he or she is ac-
quitted or the charges are dismissed or re-
duced below the previously described thresh-
old.
Banning Members, Officers, and Employees
from Sitting on Corporate Boards. Sub-
section (ii) prohibits Members, Delegates and
the Resident Commissioner, officers, and em-
ployees of the House from serving as an offi-
cer or director of any public company, effec-
tive January 1, 2020. The subsection also re-
quires the Committee on Ethics to develop
regulations by December 31, 2019, addressing
other types of prohibited service or positions
that could lead to conflicts of interest.
Suspension of the Debt Limit. Subsection
(jj) provides that when the House adopts a
budget resolution, a separate joint resolu-
tion suspending the Federal debt limit
through September 30 of the budget year is
deemed to have passed the House by the
same vote and is engrossed separately and
sent to the Senate.
Section 103. Separate Orders.
Deposition Authority. Subsection (a) pro-
vides the Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence and each standing committee of
the 116th Congress (except for the Committee
on Rules) the authority to order the taking
of a deposition by a member or counsel of
such committee. Members, Delegates, and
the Resident Commissioner may participate
in all such depositions, but their presence is
not required. Depositions taken under this
authority are subject to regulations issued
by the chair of the Committee on Rules and
printed in the Congressional Record.
Providing for Transparency with Respect
to Memorials Submitted Pursuant to Article
V of the Constitution of the United States.
Subsection (b) carries forward provisions
from the 115th Congress that clarify the pro-
cedures of the House regarding the receipt of
Article V memorials from the States by di-
recting the Clerk to make each memorial,
designated by the chair of the Committee on
the Judiciary, electronically available, orga-
nized by State of origin and year of receipt,
and indicate whether the memorial was des-
ignated as an application or rescission.
In carrying out this subsection, it is ex-
pected that the chair of the Committee on
the Judiciary will be solely charged with de-
termining whether a memorial purports to
be an application of the legislature of a state
calling for a constitutional convention or re-
scission of prior applications. The Clerk’s
role will be entirely administrative. The
chair of the Committee on the Judiciary will
only designate memorials from state legisla-
tures (and not petitions from individuals or
other parties), as it is only state legislatures
that are contemplated under Article V of the
Constitution.
In submitting each memorial to the Clerk,
the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary
will include a transmission letter that indi-
cates it has been designated under this sub-
section of House Resolution 6. The Clerk will
make publicly available the memorial and
the transmission letter from the chair. An-
cillary documentation from the state or
other parties is not expected to be pub-
licized.
The chair of the Committee on the Judici-
ary is also permitted to designate memorials
from Congresses prior to the 116th Congress
to be made publicly available under the same
procedure.
Limitation on Advance Appropriations.
Subsection (c) prohibits fiscal year 2019 gen-
eral appropriation bills or measures con-
tinuing appropriations for fiscal year 2019
from making advance appropriations, apart
from exceptions designated by the chair of
the Committee on the Budget.
Exercise Facilities for Former Members.
Subsection (d) continues the prohibition on
access to any exercise facility that is made
available exclusively to Members, Delegates,
the Resident Commissioner, former Mem-
bers, former Delegates, former Resident
Commissioners, officers, and former officers
of the House and their spouses to any former
Member, former Delegate, former Resident
Commissioner, former officer, or spouse who
is a lobbyist registered under the Lobbying
Disclosure Act of 1995.

H28 January 3, 2019
Numbering of Bills. Subsection (e) reserves
the first 10 numbers for bills (H.R. 1 through
H.R. 10) for assignment by the Speaker and
the second 10 numbers (H.R. 11 through H.R.
20) for assignment by the Minority Leader.
Inclusion of Citations for Proposed Repeals
and Amendments. Subsection (f) continues
from the 115th Congress a requirement, to
the maximum extent practicable, for parallel
citations for amendatory instructions to
Public Laws and Statutes at Large that are
not classified in the U.S. Code.
Broadening Availability of Legislative
Documents in Machine-Readable Formats.
Subsection (g) continues from the 115th Con-
gress a requirement to instruct the appro-
priate officers and committees to continue
to advance government transparency by tak-
ing further steps to publish documents of the
House in machine-readable formats.
Subcommittees. Subsection (h) waives
clause 5(d) of rule X to allow the Committee
on Agriculture up to six subcommittees,
which is consistent with authorities in the
114th and 115th Congresses, and the Com-
mittee on Financial Services up to seven
subcommittees.
Requiring Committee Hearing and Markup
on Bills and Joint Resolutions. Subsection
(i) provides, effective March 1, 2019, a point
of order against the consideration of a bill or
joint resolution pursuant to a special order
of business reported by the Committee on
Rules if such measure has not been reported
by at least one committee. The provision
also provides a point of order against any
bill or joint resolution reported by com-
mittee if the report does not contain a list of
relevant committee and subcommittee hear-
ings, which includes the designation of at
least one such hearing that was used to de-
velop or consider the underlying measure.
Finally, the provision provides exceptions to
the points of order for continuing resolu-
tions, measures that contain specified emer-
gency designations pursuant to the Balanced
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act,
and measures on the Consensus Calendar des-
ignated for consideration pursuant to clause
7(a) of rule XV.
Member Day Hearing Requirement. Sub-
section (j) requires each standing committee
(except for the Committee on Ethics) to hold
a Member Day Hearing during the first ses-
sion of the 116th Congress to hear testimony
from Members, Delegates, and the Resident
Commissioner—whether or not they are a
member of the committee—on proposed leg-
islation within its jurisdiction. The sub-
section permits the Committee on Rules to
hold its Member Day Hearing during the sec-
ond session, in order to receive testimony on
proposed changes to the standing rules for
the next Congress.
Empaneling Investigative Subcommittee
of the Committee on Ethics. Subsection (k)
reinstates House Resolution 451 from the
110th Congress, directing the Committee on
Ethics to empanel an investigative sub-
committee or issue a report within 30 days of
the date a Member, Delegate, or the Resident
Commissioner is indicted or criminal
charges are filed. The subsection updates any
references in House Resolution 451 to the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct
to be references to the Committee on Ethics.
War Powers Resolution. Subsection (I) ex-
pressly provides that any motion to dis-
charge a measure introduced pursuant to
section 6 or section 7 of the War Powers Res-
olution would not be subject to a motion to
table. House action on similar House proce-
dures has made it unclear as to whether such
a motion to table would be available. The
order serves to provide certainty for all
Members, Delegates, and the Resident Com-
missioner on this procedure.
Budget Matters. Subsection (m) reestab-
lishes that the allocations, aggregates, and
other appropriate levels contained in the
statement of the chair of the Committee on
the Budget of May 10, 2018, as adjusted dur-
ing the 115th Congress, are effective pending
the adoption of an FY19 budget resolution.
The subsection also provides that the provi-
sions of House Concurrent Resolution 71
from the 115th Congress, effective pursuant
to section 30104(f)(1) of the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2018, will no longer be in effect except
for sections 5201, 5202, 5203, and 5401.
Legal Issues Related to the Patient Protec-
tion and Affordable Care Act. Subsection (n)
authorizes the Speaker, on behalf of the
House, to intervene, otherwise appear, or
take any other steps in Texas v. United
States, No. 4:18–cv–00167–0 (N.D. Tex.), or any
other case involving the constitutionality or
legality of any provision of the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act, including
provisions ensuring affordable health cov-
erage for those with preexisting conditions.
Legal Issues Related to the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program. Subsection
(o) directs the Office of General Counsel of
the House of Representatives to explore all
possible legal options for responding to any
rulemaking by the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture, on or after December
20, 2018, to the Supplemental Nutrition As-
sistance Program involving requirements for
able-bodied adults without dependents.
Congressional Member Organization Trans-
parency Reform. Subsection (p) allows par-
ticipating Members to enter into agreements
with eligible Congressional Member Organi-
zations for the purpose of payment of sala-
ries and expenses and expands the definition
of Congressional Member Organizations from
the 114th and 115th Congresses. The sub-
section requires that for the organization to
be eligible during the 116th Congress, the or-
ganization must register with the Com-
mittee on House Administration, designate a
single Member to be responsible for the ad-
ministration of the organization, have at
least 3 employees assigned to perform some
work for the organization, and had at least
15 Members during the 115th Congress using
a portion of their Members’ Representational
Allowance (MRA) to pay for the salaries and
expenses of the organization.
Non-Disclosure Agreements. Subsection (q)
provides that Non-Disclosure Agreements re-
quired by offices as a condition of employ-
ment for paid or unpaid staff or contractors
cannot require notice or approval for em-
ployees to communicate with the Committee
on Ethics, the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights, or any other office or entity
designated by the Committee on House Ad-
ministration; and that Non-Disclosure
Agreements must also provide clear guid-
ance to that effect.
Requiring Members to Pay for Discrimina-
tion Settlements. Subsection (r) requires a
Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commis-
sioner to reimburse the Treasury for any set-
tlement of a complaint related to a claim al-
leging a violation by the Member of sections
201(a), 206(a), or 207 of the Congressional Ac-
countability Act of 1995, which cover dis-
crimination based on race, color, religion,
sex (which the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission recognizes as including
sexual orientation and gender identity), na-
tional origin, disability, or an employee’s
service in the uniformed services, and retal-
iation for claims alleging such discrimina-
tion.
Mandatory Anti-Harassment and Anti-Dis-
crimination Policies for House Offices. Sub-
section (s) requires each House office to
adopt an anti-harassment and anti-discrimi-
nation policy. Identical language was passed
by the House in House Resolution 724 in the
115th Congress. It requires the Committee on
House Administration to issue regulations to
carry out the subsection by April 1, 2019.
Displaying Statement of Rights and Pro-
tections Provided to House Employees. Sub-
section (t) directs the Committee on House
Administration to issue regulations requir-
ing each House office to prominently display
a statement of the rights and protections
provided to House employees under the Con-
gressional Accountability Act of 1995, includ-
ing procedures available to employees for re-
sponding to and adjudicating allegations of
workplace rights violations. Identical lan-
guage was passed by the House in the 115th
Congress in House Resolution 630.
Section 104. Committees, Commissions, and
House Offices.
House Democracy Partnership. Subsection
(a) reauthorizes the House Democracy As-
sistance Commission, now known as the
House Democracy Partnership.
Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.
Subsection (b) reauthorizes the Tom Lantos
Human Rights Commission. The subsection
carries forward and makes modest modifica-
tions to provisions from the 115th Congress
to reaffirm that the commission’s budget is
in addition to and separate from the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs’ budget, and
to ensure equal distribution of funding be-
tween the commission’s co-chairs to reflect
the bipartisan structure of the commission.
It authorizes $52,000 for staff and resources in
the first quarter of 2019.
Office of Congressional Ethics. Subsection
(c) reauthorizes the Office of Congressional
Ethics (OCE) and carries forward provisions
from the 115th Congress without substantive
revision.
Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Sub-
section (d) establishes the Office of Diversity
and Inclusion in the House of Representa-
tives. The subsection instructs the Speaker,
in consultation with the Minority Leader, to
appoint a Director from recommendations
provided by the chair of the Committee on
House Administration, in consultation with
the ranking minority member. The sub-
section establishes a 60–day deadline after
the appointment of the Director for the Of-
fice to submit an operational plan to the
Committee on House Administration. Within
90 days of submitting the operational plan,
the Office is required to submit a diversity
plan to the Committee on House Administra-
tion for review and approval.
The diversity plan must include: (1) poli-
cies to direct and guide House offices to re-
cruit, hire, train, develop, advance, promote
and retain a diverse workforce; (2) the devel-
opment of a survey to evaluate diversity in
House offices; (3) a framework for the House
of Representatives diversity report; and (4) a
proposal for the composition of an Advisory
Council to inform the work of the Office.
The subsection also requires the Office to
submit a House of Representatives diversity
report at the end of each session of Congress
to the Speaker, the Majority and Minority
Leaders, and the chairs and ranking minor-
ity members of the Committee on House Ad-
ministration and the Subcommittee on the
Legislative Branch of the Committee on Ap-
propriations.
Office of the Whistleblower Ombudsman.
Subsection (e) establishes an Office of the
Whistleblower Ombudsman and authorizes
the Speaker, in consultation with the chairs
and ranking minority members of the Com-
mittees on House Administration and Over-
sight and Reform, to appoint a Whistle-
blower Ombudsman. The subsection also in-
structs the Whistleblower Ombudsman,
under the direction of the Committee on
House Administration and in consultation
with other committees at the request of
their chairs, to develop best practices for
whistleblower intake for House offices and
provide trainings to House offices on how to

Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.
Subsection (f) establishes a Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis to investigate,
study, make findings, and develop rec-
ommendations on policies, strategies, and
innovations to achieve substantial and per-
manent reductions in pollution and other ac-
tivities that contribute to the climate crisis.
The Select Committee is authorized to hold
hearings and may report to the House or any
committee the results of its investigations
and studies, together with any detailed find-
ings and policy recommendations it deems
advisable. The subsection requires that it
issue all policy recommendations to the rel-
evant standing committees by March 31, 2020
and submit all reports to the House by De-
cember 31, 2020.
The Speaker is directed to appoint 15 Mem-
bers, Delegates, or the Resident Commis-
sioner to serve on the Select Committee and
to designate one of its members to serve as
the chair. Six of the 15 members must be ap-
pointed on the recommendation of the Mi-
nority Leader.
The Select Committee will be governed by
Rules X and XI, except as provided in the
subsection. The subsection does not extend
subpoena and deposition authority to the Se-
lect Committee, but authorizes the Select
Committee to submit subpoena and deposi-
tion recommendations to the relevant stand-
ing committees.
Section 105. Orders of Business.
Subsection (a) allows the Speaker to recog-
nize Members, Delegates, or the Resident
Commissioner for the reading of the Con-
stitution on any legislative day during the
first session of the 116th Congress.
Subsection (b) grants the Speaker author-
ity to consider bills under suspension of the
rules through the legislative day of January
17, 2019.
Subsection (c) grants the House authority,
through the legislative day of January 8,
2019, to adopt a report from the Committee
on Rules through a majority vote on the
same day it is filed, if the resolution re-
ported is related to a measure making or
continuing appropriations for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2019.
TITLE II. SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE
MODERNIZATION OF CONGRESS.
Title II establishes a Select Committee on
the Modernization of Congress to inves-
tigate, study, make findings, hold public
hearings, and develop recommendations on
modernizing Congress. Topics for investiga-
tion include: (1) rules to promote a more
modern and efficient Congress; (2) procedures
including the schedule and calendar; (3) poli-
cies to develop the next generation of lead-
ers; (4) staff recruitment, diversity, reten-
tion, and compensation and benefits; (5) ad-
ministrative efficiencies; (6) technology and
innovation; and (7) the Franking Commis-
sion.
The title requires the Select Committee to
provide interim status reports to the Com-
mittee on House Administration and the
Committee on Rules. It authorizes the Select
Committee to report the results of investiga-
tions and studies to the House on a rolling
basis, along with detailed findings and policy
recommendations, and requires a final such
report at the end of the first session of the
116th Congress. All policy recommendations
must be agreed to by at least 2/3 of the Se-
lect Committee’s members.
The Speaker is directed to appoint 12 Mem-
bers, Delegates, or the Resident Commis-
sioner to serve on the Select Committee, in-
cluding two members serving in their first
term, two members of the Committee on
Rules, and two members from the Committee
on House Administration. Six of the 12 mem-
bers must be appointed on the recommenda-
tion of the Minority Leader, including one
member from each of the three described
categories. The Speaker is directed to des-
ignate a chair, and, on the recommendation
of the Minority Leader, a vice chair.
The Select Committee will be governed by
Rules X and XI, except as provided in the
subsection. The subsection does not extend
subpoena and deposition authority to the Se-
lect Committee, but authorizes the Select
Committee to submit subpoena and deposi-
tion recommendations to the relevant stand-
ing committees. The Select Committee is re-
quired to hold a Member Day Hearing.
TITLE III. INTERVENTION IN LITIGATION INVOLV-
ING PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE
CARE ACT.
Title III authorizes the Speaker, on behalf
of the House, to intervene, otherwise appear,
or take any other steps, in the case Texas v.
United States, No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D.
Tex.), in any appellate proceedings arising
from such case. In addition, Title III author-
izes the Speaker, in consultation with the
Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, to inter-
vene, otherwise appear, or take any other
steps in any other cases involving the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to
protect the institutional interests of the
House and to defend such act and the amend-
ments made by such Act to other provisions
of law, and any amendments to such provi-
sions, including the provisions ensuring af-
fordable health coverage for those with pre-
existing conditions.
The title directs the Office of General
Counsel of the House of Representatives to
represent the House in any such litigation
and authorizes the Office of General Counsel
to employ the services of outside counsel, in-
cluding pro bono counsel, or other outside
experts.
The title also requires the chair of the
Committee on House Administration to print
in the Congressional Record the aggregate
amounts expended on outside counsel and
other experts within 30 days of the end of
each quarter.
This title is included to protect the insti-
tutional interests of the House of Represent-
atives in litigation involving the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, given
that the Department of Justice has not only
refused to defend provisions of the law, but
has affirmatively argued that certain provi-
sions are unconstitutional.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER), someone we
worked with very closely on this rules
package.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of our new rules package that will help
get more broadly based bipartisan leg-
islation to the floor for debate and a
vote.
Both in New Jersey and in Wash-
ington, D.C., people are frustrated that
Congress can’t get things done. Wheth-
er it is completing the critical Gate-
way project back home in between New
York and New Jersey, getting
healthcare premiums down, cutting red
tape, or lowering our taxes, common-
sense ideas with broad bipartisan sup-
port often never make it to the House
floor because a handful of splinter ob-
structionists use old-school tricks to
block commonsense ideas.
After years of hearing these com-
plaints in diners and town halls at
home, a group I co-chair called the
Problem Solvers Caucus, comprised of
half Democratic and half Republican
Members, 7 months ago called for a re-
form package to break the gridlock.
Especially in this era of a divided
Congress, where we have a Democratic
House and a Republican Senate and
White House, to get things done, Con-
gress will have to work together to de-
liver legislation with broad support.
Whether that is fixing our infrastruc-
ture or getting healthcare costs down,
we are going to have to work together.
Today, we will take the first step
with both Republicans and Democrats
voting on the rules package that in-
cludes many of the Problem Solvers’
break the gridlock ideas, including the
new Consensus Calendar and modern-
izing the motion to vacate and dis-
charge petition.
The changes that we are making will
also allow a full 3 days for us to actu-
ally read legislation before we vote on
it, letting us have a full understanding
of what we are voting on—just com-
monsense. We are also requiring hear-
ings and markups on major legislation,
again, all things that just seem like
common sense that we should be doing.
I am deeply proud of this Chamber,
and I thank Speaker PELOSI and Chair-
man MCGOVERN and their excellent
teams for their hard work in reforming
the House. I thank my co-chair of the
Problem Solvers Caucus, Congressman
TOM REED from New York, and the
whole Problem Solvers Caucus for this
big step in their work for a more coop-
erative, productive, and bipartisan
House of Representatives.

Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN).
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman
MCGOVERN for his leadership and this
opportunity.
As the only Member representing
Puerto Rico in this Congress, I rep-
resent 3.2 million American citizens
living on the island, and there are 5.4
million Puerto Ricans living on the
mainland.
Today, while we are discussing this
resolution that will give Delegates and
the Resident Commissioner the oppor-
tunity to vote in the Committee of the
Whole, one issue that triggers me being
here is that our vote would only count
if the cast votes are not deciding votes.
So we can vote in the Committee of the
Whole, as the rule is providing, but if
the casting votes are in contest, then
you need to do a second round of votes
without the territories.
That is like a symbolic vote, and
that is the reason the people of Puerto
Rico want to become a State. That is
the only way we can achieve four Mem-
bers of Congress representing Puerto
Rico in the House, two Members on the
Senate side, not just using a symbolic
vote in this House.
As a matter of an example, a few
minutes ago our names, the territories’

Delegates names were on the board,
but we can’t vote on regular bills. We
can’t vote on anything else. So it will
look like we are not present during the
debates. It will look like we are not
present on the floor of the House when-
ever there is a real discussion on the
floor, but our names are still there. We
can’t vote ‘‘yes’’; we can’t vote ‘‘no.’’
Mr. Speaker, I think it is not a sym-
bolic vote. This is a good step, but we
should have the full right to vote.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a statement on the
interpretation of clause 8 of Rule II.
STATEMENT BY CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN ON CIVIL
ENFORCEMENT OF SUBPOENAS PURSUANT TO
HOUSE RULE II(8)(B)
I want to speak regarding House Rule
II(8)(b). Pursuant to this provision, the Bi-
partisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) is
delegated the authority to speak for the full
House of Representatives with respect to all
litigation matters. A vote of the BLAG to
authorize litigation and to articulate the in-
stitutional position of the House in that liti-
gation, is the equivalent of a vote of the full
House of Representatives. For example, in
the 115th Congress, the BLAG, pursuant to
Rule II(8)(b), authorized House Committees
to intervene in ongoing litigation. The
BLAG has been delegated this authority for
all litigation matters, and I want to be clear
that this includes litigation related to the
civil enforcement of a Committee subpoena.
If a Committee determines that one or more
of its duly issued subpoenas has not been
complied with and that civil enforcement is
necessary, the BLAG, pursuant to House
Rule II(8)(b), may authorize the House Office
of General Counsel to initiate civil litigation
on behalf of this Committee to enforce the
Committee’s subpoena(s) in federal district
court.

clude in the RECORD a list of all Mem-
bers and caucuses who offered ideas

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee and I thank the team, all the
opportunities that we had to engage in
this rules package.
It is a new day, Mr. Speaker, a new
day because I am glad that we have
opened some opportunity for our Dele-
gates and Commissioners to be able to
participate on behalf of their millions
of constituents, which did not occur
under Republican rule. That is a won-
derful new step.
But I do acknowledge the fact that
we are $2 trillion in debt and that the
deficit has increased under this admin-
istration, and here we are now asking
for $5.2 billion for a border wall.
I am glad that this rules package is
transparent and fiscally responsible,
but I am most excited about the re-
sponsibility for the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act because, un-
fortunately, my State, the State of
Texas, is leading an ill-fated legisla-
tion litigation that would undermine
the right of Americans to have good
healthcare. It will undermine the pro-
tection for those with a preexisting
condition. It will undermine the fact
that Texas was a poster child for unin-
sured Americans.
Twenty-five percent of our State was
uninsured, and this legislation indi-
cates that our Speaker can intervene
on any legislation and/or litigation
that interferes with or undermines pro-
tecting the American people’s
healthcare. That is what they voted
for. That is why they sent us to the
United States Congress. That is why we
are here.
And for the many people that suffer
that I see in my district, again, the
poster child for uninsured Americans,
now we have, in this rules package, the
ability of our Speaker to stand up for
the American people and to fight for
the healthcare that they so desire.
So if there is anything in here that I
can support—and there are many,
many things of transparency—the fact
that we now can stand up to protect
the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act is one for this Nation. It is a
new day, and our people will survive
because of that.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS).
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Oklahoma, and I
congratulate him on being the ranking
member of the Rules Committee. I also
congratulate the new chairman of the
Rules Committee.
Mr. Speaker, I do speak in opposition
to the rule. This authorization for the
Speaker of the House to intervene in
any lawsuit, particularly the one in
Texas, is not a good idea, not some-
thing that I think that we should be
pursuing.
The Affordable Care Act has multiple
problems. We are forcing people to buy
insurance they can’t afford, don’t un-
derstand, and can’t use. They are func-
tionally uninsured, and they are out a
ton of money to do that.
In addition, the work requirements
that the Department of Agriculture is
working on after the farm bill was
passed, this is something that is impor-
tant for the administration. We have
more jobs than we have workers. Peo-
ple should be working, and it is time to
get people back to work.
Finally, the addition of the Gephardt
rule but the removal of the require-
ment that the Senate concur with the
House budget before the Gephardt rule
goes into effect, this is a dangerous
policy and one this House ought to re-
ject.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire how much time I have left.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has 13⁄4
minutes remaining.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, may I make
the same inquiry as to my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oklahoma has 8 minutes
remaining.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES).
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in strong opposition to H. Res. 6.
Among the many rule changes in-
cluded, this bill opens the door for
Democrats to raise taxes by removing
the current requirement of a three-
fifths majority of the House of Rep-
resentatives to pass a tax increase.
At a time when our Nation’s debt is
$22 trillion, increasing taxes and gov-
ernment spending will only succeed in
further bankrupting our children and
grandchildren. For generations, Ameri-
cans have worked to leave the country
better off for their kids and grandkids.
Mortgaging our kids’ future will not do
that.
Following implementation of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act, our economy has
experienced historic growth. Instead of
building upon that progress, this bill
would allow the Democrats to raise
taxes with a simple majority vote,
stopping our economy in its tracks.
It is a shame that my colleagues
have spent their first day in the major-
ity seeking to change the rules to
allow for tax and debt increases. Once
this bill is passed, it is all but certain
that the Democrats will then use the
mechanisms to raise taxes on families
in Kansas and across our Nation to pay
for increased government spending.
This is a dangerous precedent that
should be widely opposed, and I urge
my colleagues to vote against this bill.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I
would just remind the gentleman, in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H31
January 3, 2019
the last 2 years, the Republicans have
exploded the debt by $2 trillion.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to
begin by urging all Members to oppose
this measure. While the rule package
includes some provisions Republicans
can certainly support, it, unfortu-
nately, includes too many provisions
that we cannot.
The rule package today removes im-
portant fiscal responsibility measures
from House rules, establishes a par-
tisan climate committee, and grants
the Speaker the power to intervene in
a lawsuit over the legality of the ACA.
Those are all things that my con-
ference, quite frankly, is unanimously
opposed to.
I do want to address, just in passing,
my friend’s discussion about the def-
icit. I will remind him, when President
Obama was in office, that deficit was
doubled, actually increased at a faster
rate, particularly when my friends
were empowered in the first opening 2
years, than it ever has in any peace-
time in American history.
The deficit is all too high. I agree
with my friends very much on that. I
am glad they are born-again deficit
hawks. That means they are going to
be serious about entitlement reform,
because we all know what drives the
deficit here, and that is simply the de-
mographic reality of an aging popu-
lation and an overextended bunch of
entitlements.
I actually have a bipartisan bill,
which I would encourage my friends to
look at, which doesn’t dictate an out-
come but actually sets up the same
sort of process that Democrats and Re-
publicans worked on together in 1983,
the last time Social Security was at
risk, came to a bipartisan compromise,
developed something that restored the
fiscal sanity. That is legislation my
friend in the former Congress, Mr.
DELANEY, and I had for three Con-
gresses. We could never get anybody in-
terested in it on either side of the aisle.
So if my friends want to engage in a
virtuous debate about dealing with the
deficit, I am all for it. I actually have
a bipartisan remedy that I would invite
them to look at, and I think it would
yield us a very good result and start us
down that road. But that is for another
day. I want to end on a positive note.
I again want to congratulate my
friend from Massachusetts (Mr.
MCGOVERN) on his elevation to chair-
man of the Rules Committee. I know
very much, from having worked with
him for many years, that he will keep
his word because he always has, that he
will operate in a manner that is above-
board and that is fair and respectful to
all, and that he will seriously do what
he is committed to do, and that is en-
tertain suggestions from all quarters. I
actually have no doubt that he will do
that, and I genuinely look forward to
having the opportunity to work with
him on the committee that he chairs
during the next 2 years.
He is going to do, certainly, not only
a good job for the people of his con-
ference, but I believe a good job for the
people of this institution and for the
American people as well.
Mr. Speaker, despite my affections, I
do urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous
question and ‘‘no’’ on the underlying
measure.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the
gentleman from Oklahoma for his kind
words, and I hope he knows how much
I respect him and how much I admire
him.
Mr. Speaker, there are so many peo-
ple who played a role in crafting these
rules, from our historymaking Speak-
er, who gave us the opportunity to so-
licit Member feedback, and the many
colleagues who spoke with me about
their suggestions, to the office of the
Parliamentarian and the Office of Leg-
islative Counsel, to our incredible
Rules staff. All made important con-
tributions to this package. I want to
thank everyone for their involvement.
Their work and dedication made these
historic rules possible.
We have a unique moment here to
implement real reforms, to say no to
business as usual and create a better
legislative process and make progress
on the majority’s agenda, while mak-
ing this House look like the real world.
Let’s seize this opportunity.
I urge all my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes’’ on this package. Let’s restore in-
tegrity to this place and get to work on
behalf of the people we represent.
And that is not just the view of the
majority. I know that many in the mi-
nority share that view. We can do bet-
ter. I look forward to working with the
gentleman from Oklahoma and others
on the Republican side of the aisle as
we move forward in this new session.
Mr. Speaker, I urge everybody to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this great rules package,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.

ant to House Resolution 5, the previous

SEC. 747. (a) The Secretary of Agriculture
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘Sec-
retary’’) shall carry out a pilot program dur-
ing fiscal year 2019 with respect to the 2018
crop year for county-level agriculture risk
coverage payments under section 1117(b)(1) of
the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C.
9017(b)(1)), that provides all or some of the
State Farm Service Agency offices in each
State the opportunity to provide agricul-
tural producers in the State a supplemental
payment described in subsection (c) based on
the alternate calculation method described
in subsection (b) for 1 or more counties in a
State if the office for that State determines
that the alternate calculation method is nec-
essary to ensure that, to the maximum ex-
tent practicable, there are not significant
yield calculation disparities between com-
parable counties in the State.
(b) The alternate calculation method re-
ferred to in subsection (a) is a method of cal-
culating the actual yield for the 2018 crop
year for county-level agriculture risk cov-
erage payments under section 1117(b)(1) of
the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C.
9017(b)(1)), under which—
(1) county data of the National Agricul-
tural Statistics Service (referred to in this
section as ‘‘NASS data’’) is used for the cal-
culations;
(2) if there is insufficient NASS data for a
county (as determined under standards of
the Secretary in effect as of the date of en-
actment of this Act) or the available NASS
data produces a substantially disparate re-
sult, the calculation of the county yield is
determined using comparable contiguous
county NASS data as determined by the
Farm Service Agency office in the applicable
State; and
(3) if there is insufficient NASS data for a
comparable contiguous county (as deter-
mined under standards of the Secretary in
effect as of the date of enactment of this
Act), the calculation of the county yield is
determined using reliable yield data from
other sources, such as Risk Management
Agency data, National Agricultural Statis-
tics Service district data, National Agricul-
tural Statistics Service State yield data, or
other data as determined by the Farm Serv-
ice Agency office in the applicable State.
(c)(1) A supplemental payment made under
the pilot program established under this sec-
tion may be made to an agricultural pro-
ducer who is subject to the alternate calcula-
tion method described in subsection (b) if
that agricultural producer would otherwise
receive a county-level agriculture risk cov-
erage payment for the 2018 crop year in an
amount that is less than the payment that
the agricultural producer would receive
under the alternate calculation method.
(2) The amount of a supplemental payment
to an agricultural producer under this sec-
tion may not exceed the difference between—
(A) the payment that the agricultural pro-
ducer would have received without the alter-
nate calculation method described in sub-
section (b); and
(B) the payment that the agricultural pro-
ducer would receive using the alternate cal-
culation method.
(d)(1) There is appropriated to the Sec-
retary, out of funds of the Treasury not oth-
erwise appropriated, $5,000,000, to remain
available until September 30, 2020, to carry
out the pilot program described in this sec-
tion.
(2) Of the funds appropriated, the Sec-
retary shall use not more than $5,000,000 to
carry out the pilot program described in this
section.
(e)(1) To the maximum extent practicable,
the Secretary shall select States to partici-
pate in the pilot program under this section
so the cost of the pilot program equals the
amount provided under subsection (d).
(2) To the extent that the cost of the pilot
program exceeds the amount made available,
the Secretary shall reduce all payments
under the pilot program on a pro rata basis.
(f) Nothing in this section affects the cal-
culation of actual yield for purposes of coun-
ty-level agriculture risk coverage payments

SEC. 211. (a) No assistance shall be provided
under section 8 of the United States Housing
Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) to any individual

Federal programs, the Secretary shall main-
tain any rental assistance payments under
section 8 of the United States Housing Act of
1937 and other programs that are attached to
any dwelling units in the property. To the
extent the Secretary determines, in con-
sultation with the tenants and the local gov-
ernment, that such a multifamily property
owned or held by the Secretary is not fea-
sible for continued rental assistance pay-
ments under such section 8 or other pro-
grams, based on consideration of (1) the costs
of rehabilitating and operating the property
and all available Federal, State, and local re-
sources, including rent adjustments under
section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted Hous-
ing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997

fective fashion, the Secretary may, in con-
sultation with the tenants of that property,
contract for project-based rental assistance
payments with an owner or owners of other
existing housing properties, or provide other
rental assistance. The Secretary shall also
take appropriate steps to ensure that
project-based contracts remain in effect
prior to foreclosure, subject to the exercise
of contractual abatement remedies to assist
relocation of tenants for imminent major
threats to health and safety after written
notice to and informed consent of the af-
fected tenants and use of other available
remedies, such as partial abatements or re-
ceivership. After disposition of any multi-
family property described under this section,
the contract and allowable rent levels on
such properties shall be subject to the re-
quirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.
SEC. 214. The commitment authority fund-
ed by fees as provided under the heading
‘‘Community Development Loan Guarantees
Program Account’’ may be used to guar-
antee, or make commitments to guarantee,

nities in the State in accordance with the re-
quirements of section 108 of the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1974: Pro-

may elect to be exempt from any asset man-
agement requirement imposed by the Sec-
retary of Housing and Urban Development in
connection with the operating fund rule: Pro-
vided, That an agency seeking a discontinu-
ance of a reduction of subsidy under the op-
erating fund formula shall not be exempt
from asset management requirements.
SEC. 216. With respect to the use of
amounts provided in this Act and in future
Acts for the operation, capital improvement
and management of public housing as au-
thorized by sections 9(d) and 9(e) of the
United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.
1437g(d) and (e)), the Secretary shall not im-
pose any requirement or guideline relating
to asset management that restricts or limits
in any way the use of capital funds for cen-
tral office costs pursuant to section 9(g)(1) or
9(g)(2) of the United States Housing Act of
1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)): Provided, That
a public housing agency may not use capital
funds authorized under section 9(d) for ac-
tivities that are eligible under section 9(e)
for assistance with amounts from the oper-
ating fund in excess of the amounts per-
mitted under section 9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2).
SEC. 217. No official or employee of the De-
partment of Housing and Urban Development
shall be designated as an allotment holder
unless the Office of the Chief Financial Offi-
cer has determined that such allotment hold-
er has implemented an adequate system of
funds control and has received training in
funds control procedures and directives. The
Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that
there is a trained allotment holder for each
HUD appropriation under the accounts ‘‘Ex-
ecutive Offices’’ and ‘‘Administrative Sup-
port Offices,’’ as well as each account receiv-
ing appropriations under the general heading
‘‘Program Office Salaries and Expenses’’,
‘‘Government National Mortgage Associa-
tion—Guarantees of Mortgage-Backed Secu-
rities Loan Guarantee Program Account’’,
and ‘‘Office of Inspector General’’ within the
Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment.
SEC. 218. The Secretary of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development shall, for
fiscal year 2019, notify the public through
the Federal Register and other means, as de-
termined appropriate, of the issuance of a
notice of the availability of assistance or no-
tice of funding availability (NOFA) for any
program or discretionary fund administered
by the Secretary that is to be competitively
awarded. Notwithstanding any other provi-
sion of law, for fiscal year 2019, the Secretary

SEC. 220. The Secretary is authorized to
transfer up to 10 percent or $5,000,000, which-

assistance payments shall maintain decent,
safe, and sanitary conditions, as determined

velopment (in this section referred to as the
‘‘Secretary’’), and comply with any stand-
ards under applicable State or local laws,
rules, ordinances, or regulations relating to
the physical condition of any property cov-
ered under a housing assistance payment
contract.
(b) The Secretary shall take action under
subsection (c) when a multifamily housing
project with a section 8 contract or contract
for similar project-based assistance—
(1) receives a Uniform Physical Condition
Standards (UPCS) score of 60 or less; or
(2) fails to certify in writing to the Sec-
retary within 3 days that all Exigent Health
and Safety deficiencies identified by the in-
spector at the project have been corrected.
Such requirements shall apply to insured
and noninsured projects with assistance at-
tached to the units under section 8 of the
United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.
1437f), but do not apply to such units assisted
under section 8(o)(13) (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13))
or to public housing units assisted with cap-
ital or operating funds under section 9 of the
United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.
1437g).
(c)(1) Within 15 days of the issuance of the
REAC inspection, the Secretary must pro-
vide the owner with a Notice of Default with
a specified timetable, determined by the Sec-
retary, for correcting all deficiencies. The
Secretary must also provide a copy of the
Notice of Default to the tenants, the local
government, any mortgagees, and any con-
tract administrator. If the owner’s appeal re-
sults in a UPCS score of 60 or above, the Sec-
retary may withdraw the Notice of Default.

(C) abate the section 8 contract, including
partial abatement, as determined by the Sec-
retary, until all deficiencies have been cor-
rected;

owner, approved by the Secretary under es-
tablished procedures, which will be obligated
to promptly make all required repairs and to
accept renewal of the assistance contract as
long as such renewal is offered;
(E) transfer the existing section 8 contract
to another project or projects and owner or
owners;
(F) pursue exclusionary sanctions, includ-
ing suspensions or debarments from Federal

cific performance requiring the owner to
cure all project deficiencies;
(H) work with the owner, lender, or other
related party to stabilize the property in an
attempt to preserve the property through
compliance, transfer of ownership, or an in-
fusion of capital provided by a third-party

tual remedies available as deemed necessary
and appropriate by the Secretary.
(d) The Secretary shall also take appro-
priate steps to ensure that project-based con-
tracts remain in effect, subject to the exer-
cise of contractual abatement remedies to
assist relocation of tenants for major threats
to health and safety after written notice to
the affected tenants. To the extent the Sec-
retary determines, in consultation with the
tenants and the local government, that the
property is not feasible for continued rental
assistance payments under such section 8 or
other programs, based on consideration of—
(1) the costs of rehabilitating and oper-
ating the property and all available Federal,
State, and local resources, including rent ad-
justments under section 524 of the Multi-
family Assisted Housing Reform and Afford-
ability Act of 1997 (‘‘MAHRAA’’); and
(2) environmental conditions that cannot
be remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the
Secretary may contract for project-based
rental assistance payments with an owner or
owners of other existing housing properties,
or provide other rental assistance.
(e) The Secretary shall report quarterly on
all properties covered by this section that
are assessed through the Real Estate Assess-
ment Center and have UPCS physical inspec-
tion scores of less than 60 or have received
an unsatisfactory management and occu-
pancy review within the past 36 months. The
report shall include—
(1) the enforcement actions being taken to
address such conditions, including imposi-
tion of civil money penalties and termi-
nation of subsidies, and identify properties
that have such conditions multiple times;
(2) actions that the Department of Housing
and Urban Development is taking to protect
tenants of such identified properties; and
(3) any administrative or legislative rec-
ommendations to further improve the living
conditions at properties covered under a
housing assistance payment contract.

TITLE IV
BUDGETARY EFFECTS
SEC. 401. Effective on the date of enact-
ment of this Act, the balances on the PAYGO
scorecards established pursuant to para-
graphs (4) and (5) of section 4(d) of the Statu-
tory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (2 U.S.C.
933(d)) shall be zero.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 5, the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY)
and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
GRANGER) each will control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
As this new Congress begins our work
for the American people, I thank my
colleagues for the honor of electing me
chairwoman of the Appropriations
Committee.
I would also like to congratulate my
colleague and friend, KAY GRANGER, on
becoming ranking member. I look for-
ward to working with her and all of the
Members of our committee and this
House in the 116th Congress.
For the first time in our Nation’s his-
tory, however, we convene this new
Congress during a Federal Government
shutdown. Now in its 13th day, the
Trump shutdown has disrupted life for
more than 800,000 Federal employees
and their families, including nearly
400,000 people serving our country with-
out pay.
The shutdown has undermined public
safety, halted consumer protection pro-
grams, and made it harder for the gov-
ernment to serve farmers, home buy-
ers, and small business owners.
The devastating impact on inter-
national security and assistance initia-
tives includes halting counterdrug,
anticrime, and border security efforts,
preventing the obligation of funding
for antiterrorism assistance, cutting
off foreign military financing, and
stopping all new activities related to
global health, such as antimalaria and
HIV-AIDS treatments, as well as ma-
ternal mortality care.
As Representatives, funding the Fed-
eral Government is one of our most im-
portant duties. When Congress allows a
President to dictate ridiculous de-
mands and lets petty partisanship pre-
vent the timely passage of appropria-
tion bills, we abdicate that responsi-
bility.
Our new Democratic majority was
elected to end the chaos and govern re-
sponsibly. This legislative package to
end the Trump shutdown and fully re-
open government consists of two parts,
separating the disagreement between
President Trump and Congress over
border security from funding the rest
of the Federal Government.
The first part, the one we are consid-
ering now, provides full-year funding
for six of the seven fiscal year 2019 ap-
propriation bills that have not yet been
completed.
The text is virtually identical to bi-
partisan legislation that has already
passed the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee, nearly unanimously, and in
four cases, passed the full Senate on a
92–6 vote.
These bills are not perfect, but they
make key investments in bipartisan
priorities, do not include any poison-
pill riders, and increase funding for im-
portant programs by $53 billion more
than President Trump’s budget re-
quest.
The second part of our legislative
package, which will be presented short-
ly by our distinguished Homeland Se-
curity Appropriations Subcommittee
chairwoman, LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD,
includes a continuing resolution, fund-
ing the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity at current levels through February
8.
It would allow the Department to re-
open without providing any new fund-
ing for President Trump’s wasteful bor-
der wall.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass both bills, and I urge
the Senate to act responsibly and take
up these bills without delay. It is up to
Senate Republicans whether to vote for
their own bills and reopen the govern-
ment, or block them and continue the
Trump shutdown.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H184 January 3, 2019
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, today I rise in oppo-
sition to H.R. 21. After months of good-
faith negotiations to resolve the dif-
ferences between the House, the Sen-
ate, and the White House, the new
Democrat leadership has chosen to in-
troduce this package that fails to se-
cure our border.
The President has said that he will
not sign it. The Senate has said they
will not consider it. This plan not only
ignores one of the main responsibilities
of the Congress, which is to protect the
American people, it ignores the will of
this Chamber by eliminating House
Members’ involvement in the appro-
priations process.
All Members of the House, both
Democrats and Republicans, have pri-
orities and concerns that are not ad-
dressed in this bill. Our constituents
are not well-served by us simply rub-
ber-stamping a Senate product that
has no chance of becoming a law.
By accepting this bill, we are throw-
ing away important House priorities,
such as resources to help Federal law
enforcement better investigate and
prosecute groups such as: terrorists,
drug traffickers, human traffickers,
violent criminals, and criminal aliens.
It also ignores more than $300 million
in funding for embassy security at a
time when security threats overseas re-
main high, and countless facilities are
in need of important upgrades.
The bill also strips vital protections
for the rural poor that House Members
on both sides of the aisle have been
fighting to secure for years.
These are just a few examples,
Madam Speaker. All of us in this
Chamber were elected to represent the
best interests of our constituents. This
bill does not meet those standards.
If my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle truly care about the needs of
their constituents, Federal employees,
and keeping the government operating,
they shouldn’t be wasting time on bills
that will not be enacted.
Instead, we should come together to
find a solution that represents the will
of both the House and the Senate. It is
time to end the political gamesman-
ship and get together on a bill that will
reopen the government and fund border
security.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill before
us today, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
New York (Mr. SERRANO), the chair-
man-designate of the Commerce, Jus-
tice, Science, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee.
Mr. SERRANO. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from New
York (Mrs. LOWEY) and congratulate
her on her chairmanship. I also con-
gratulate Ms. GRANGER on her ranking
membership.
As a top Democrat on the Commerce,
Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee, I would like to discuss
what is happening right now at the De-
partment of Justice, the Department of
Commerce, NASA, and the other agen-
cies under my subcommittee’s jurisdic-
tion as a result of the Trump shut-
down.
More than 95,000 employees at the
Department of Justice, including the
FBI, DEA, ATF, Federal Bureau of
Prisons, and United States Marshals
Service are currently working without
pay.
More than 96 percent of NASA em-
ployees are now not working, imper-
iling scientific achievement. More than
86 percent of the Department of Com-
merce is furloughed without pay, in-
cluding employees at key economic de-
velopment agencies, like the Economic
Development Administration, and the
Minority Business Development Agen-
cy.
Law enforcement training programs
have been stopped. The Department of
Justice civil litigation efforts against
bad actors are severely limited. Pay-
ments to crime victims are not occur-
ring.
These are real-life consequences to
the President’s temper tantrum. This
is basic governance that the Repub-
lican Party seems to be incapable of
doing. Instead of working on a com-
promise, they sent everybody home for
the holidays.
Democrats are doing the work that
the President and his party couldn’t.
We need the government reopened;
these bills provide a clear path in that
regard. And in that direction, the Com-
merce, Justice, Science, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee portion of this
bill provides important investments to
the Census Bureau, the Justice Depart-
ment, NASA, and the National Science
Foundation, among others.
It also rejects some of the President’s
worst and most partisan policy pro-
posals, including efforts to undermine
climate research, eliminate economic
development programs, and eliminate
the Legal Services Corporation.
It also gives the Senate no excuses.
The Commerce, Justice, Science, and
Related Agencies Subcommittee’s por-
tion of this bill was approved by the
Senate Appropriations Committee by a
bipartisan vote of 30–1. It would be
great to get it approved by the Senate.
If Majority Leader MCCONNELL were to
bring it up for a vote, it would pass, we
feel, very easily.
We are all elected in order to solve
the pressing problems of our Nation.
b 1930
Right now, the President doesn’t
seem interested in doing the same. But
with this package, we are asking Sen-
ate Republicans: Will you join us in
helping the American people?
Lastly, so much of this is tied up
against the wall. Many people discuss
the actual, physical structure of the
wall. I speak about something else.
This country, of all countries in the
world, should never build a wall. This
country that has a statue in New York
Harbor saying ‘‘Bring me your tired,
your poor’’ should not be building a
wall to keep some other people out. It
is just not who we are. It is not who we
should become.
I think that the President should re-
alize that this is a losing battle, be-
cause he is not going to get the money
he wants to build that wall.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT).
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I
rise to oppose the fiscal year 2019 ap-
propriations package that is before us
tonight, as I believe it fails to reflect
the priorities of elected Members of
this body here in the House of Rep-
resentatives.
The House agriculture appropriations
bill, which I chaired as the Agriculture,
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee chairman, was bipar-
tisan. I worked with my colleague, the
Democratic ranking member, my good
friend from Georgia, SANFORD BISHOP,
on the bill.
But, unfortunately, the bill in front
of us tonight is basically, as some
would say, a nothing burger. It is
largely missing any substance. Let me
give you some examples of what I am
talking about.
The House bill that we negotiated
contained $125 million more than the
Senate bill for a broadband pilot pro-
gram. That is a program that is widely
popular among rural America.
The House bill provides $149 million
more for the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration.
The House bill protected our children
by excluding chicken from China in our
children’s school meals.
The House bill reflected my work
with Representative CLYBURN of South
Carolina to secure set-aside funds for
persistent poverty, as it continues in
rural areas.
But tonight’s package does not in-
clude these priorities. Also, they don’t
protect the border, which is one of the
most basic duties of the Federal Gov-
ernment. Certainly, one of the basic
duties that the President must make
sure that he does is to protect our Na-
tion against foreign enemies.
Among the illegal immigrants who
make their way across the southern
border are gang members. There are
human traffickers; there are child
smugglers; and there are drug dealers.
By stopping their entry at the border,
it prevents them from committing
crimes in the United States.
Instead of catering to voters who
don’t even want to have a border, I be-
lieve the House Democrats should vote
‘‘no’’ on this bill, and the Democrat
majority should negotiate an end to
the government shutdown and simply
provide the funding requested by the
President of the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H185
January 3, 2019
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this appropriations bill
tonight, and I insist on a bill that in-
cludes the House priorities.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, before
I yield to my friend, the gentleman
from North Carolina, I would like to
address a comment that my friend, Mr.
ADERHOLT, made. The bill that passed
through the gentleman’s committee
also included language that would
make it easier than it is today for
youngsters to use e-cigarettes. Perhaps
when we get back to it, we could ad-
dress that.
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to
the gentleman from North Carolina
(Mr. PRICE), who is the chairman-des-
ignate of the Transportation, Housing
and Urban Development, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise in support of the legis-
lation to reopen the government and
end this third Trump shutdown.
For the last 2 weeks, President
Trump has held America hostage to
fulfill his demagogic campaign promise
to build a border wall, a wall that has
come to symbolize extreme and inhu-
mane immigration policies that are
simply tearing our communities apart.
This is more than just a political
fight. The Trump shutdown has closed
Federal agencies and suspended essen-
tial programs that millions of Ameri-
cans rely upon. It has created uncer-
tainty for families, businesses, and
communities in each of our districts.
To those Federal employees affected
by this unnecessary shutdown, know
this: the President and his privileged
cronies may not care about how you
and your families pay your bills, but
this new Democratic majority cer-
tainly does care.
As the incoming chairman of the
Transportation, Housing and Urban De-
velopment, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee, I know this uncertainty
has severe consequences.
Already, vital funding for States and
municipalities to upgrade transit, rail,
and aviation facilities is being put on
hold.
The National Transportation Safety
Board has ceased major accident inves-
tigations.
The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration is no longer inves-
tigating or reviewing information
about motor vehicle manufacturing de-
fects that could put lives at risk.
Disaster recovery programs at FEMA
and other agencies have been slowed
due to the lapse in funding. Survivors
of these disasters in North Carolina
and other States are still recovering
from devastating hurricanes, wildfires,
and typhoons, and they simply cannot
afford this delay and this uncertainty.
New hiring and training for air traf-
fic controllers has ceased, exacerbating
an ongoing staffing shortage.
If the shutdown continues much
longer, housing assistance for millions
of low-income families, veterans, sen-
iors, and the disabled will be jeopard-
ized.
The list, Madam Speaker, goes on
and on.
President Trump and the Repub-
licans may have gotten us into this
mess, but Democrats are ready to clean
it up on day one, namely, right this
minute. The funding package before us
consists of appropriations bills that
previously passed the Senate on a bi-
partisan basis. It reflects key Demo-
cratic and Republican priorities and re-
jects partisan policy riders.
In a few minutes, separate legislation
will provide short-term funding for the
Department of Homeland Security.
That will give us more time to nego-
tiate and find a solution on border se-
curity and immigration policy.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle have been quoted calling this
a stunt or a nonstarter. Madam Speak-
er, how is legislation that passed the
Senate with 92 votes a stunt? How can
bills the Trump administration itself
praised in its official Statement of Ad-
ministrative Policy just a few months
ago be a nonstarter?
Enough is enough. President Trump
may see this as a reality show game of
chicken, but this shutdown is for real,
and it is doing real damage. Let’s do
the right thing for the American peo-
ple. Let’s reopen the government with-
out further delay.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan,
commonsense legislation to finally end
the Trump shutdown.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. ROGERS).
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, I thank the ranking member
for yielding.
Madam Speaker, tonight, there will
be a smoke-and-mirrors vote on this
House floor. Democrats want to kick
the can down the road and put Amer-
ican security on the back burner while
they gear up their obstructionist agen-
da.
It used to be that Members of Con-
gress could put partisanship aside at
least on national security issues. I
know this firsthand as a member of
both the Armed Services Committee
and the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, where we have done this on a
regular basis.
But, today, the Democrats and the
Speaker refuse to even negotiate fund-
ing a deal to deal with a critical na-
tional security issue. Unfortunately, it
looks like we are in for a Democrat
agenda influenced by the far left echo
chamber that promotes open borders
and illegal immigration.
Not too long ago, then-Senator
Barack Obama spoke in support of se-
curing the southern border and the
need to deter illegal immigration. The
bill he supported authorized the con-
struction of a physical barrier along
the southern border that would prevent
illegal entry into the United States. It
passed the Senate with 80 votes that
included Senator Barack Obama, Sen-
ator Biden, Senator Clinton, and Sen-
ator SCHUMER.
What changed? Since when did secur-
ing our border become controversial?
The election of Donald Trump.
Democrats seem willing to ignore se-
curity vulnerabilities along our border
on their quest to win back the White
House in 2020. Their plan is to block
President Trump’s priorities, even
those they used to support, and then
act like Republicans are the reason
they can’t get things done.
Today’s funding bill stands no chance
in the Senate or with President Trump.
I challenge my Democrat colleagues to
get something good done for the Amer-
ican people rather than engaging in the
political grandstanding that this bill
signifies.
I hope Speaker PELOSI won’t let the
activist left hold American security
hostage. Securing our border is not
only the right thing to do, but it is
what the American people sent us here
to do.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), who
is the chair-designate of the Interior,
Environment, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I
rise in support of this bill to reopen the
government. As the Trump shutdown
ends its 13th day, we are seeing the
damage it is inflicting on our country.
Our national parks, America’s crown
jewels, are under threat from van-
dalism and unmanaged visitation. The
Interior Department is charged with
preserving our public lands for all
Americans to enjoy. But the current
lack of supervision in our parks is dam-
aging, and the very resources that the
government is supposed to protect are
at risk.
Just this past weekend, it was re-
ported that Yosemite National Park
became overwhelmed by garbage and
other human waste piling up along the
roads. Leaving these parks accessible
without adequate National Park Serv-
ice staffing puts the public at risk.
On Christmas Eve at Big Bend Na-
tional Park, a man broke his leg while
hiking. Because of the shutdown, emer-
gency services were not available.
Thankfully, Good Samaritans found
the man and carried him down the
trail. Luckily, they met one of the few
park rangers deemed essential who was
continuing to work without pay during
the shutdown. The ranger carried the
man on his back for 2 hours to safety.
Now, this story had a positive ending,
but it could have been tragic. This is
just one story.
The shutdown is creating uncer-
tainty for our families, businesses, and
communities. More than 800,000 Fed-
eral employees aren’t getting paid.
Vital services are being disrupted.
Some small businesses with govern-
ment contracts are being forced to con-
sider laying off their employees. The
ripple effect from this shutdown is
damaging our economy.
Then there is the vital work of the
Environmental Protection Agency. It

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H186 January 3, 2019
has furloughed more than 13,000 em-
ployees, halting inspections at drink-
ing water systems and hazardous waste
management and chemical facilities.
This is just unacceptable to America’s
public health. It leaves our American
people in jeopardy.
The Trump shutdown is particularly
threatening to the health and safety of
our Native American brothers and sis-
ters. Once again, we have failed to
meet our commitments to Tribal na-
tions as the delay in government fund-
ing continues. Everyday, basic services
like health clinics, schools, and food
assistance for our seniors are being put
at risk for nearly 1.9 million Americans
throughout Indian Country.
Federally employed first responders
are putting their lives on the line with-
out pay. It is unconscionable to put
people’s lives at risk.
We must reopen this government. Re-
sponsibly funding the government is
one of Congress’ most important du-
ties. The Republicans failed to meet
this obligation, and they have allowed
President Trump to peddle chaos.
Democrats are ready to end the Trump
shutdown.
This bill is nearly identical to the
legislation that has already received
overwhelming bipartisan support in the
Senate. It reflects the priorities of the
American people by rejecting President
Trump’s proposed budget cuts and pro-
gram eliminations, including the poi-
son pill riders.
The second bill we will consider
today, the homeland security bill, will
create space for negotiation on immi-
gration policy and border security,
something Democrats do support
strongly.
After the House passes these bills,
the Senate will have a choice: pass the
bills they previously voted for and end
the shutdown, or reject them and leave
the government closed.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. GRAVES).
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman
from Texas for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition
to this bill that is before us tonight.
Unfortunately, this 116th Congress has
begun under the cloud of a government
shutdown. The prosperity and security
of our Nation has taken a backseat to
the new Democrat majority’s political
agenda.
While President Trump has asked for
modest and reasonable funding to se-
cure our border, Democrats have
blocked this deal, one that would have
fully funded the government several
weeks ago, even before Christmas. The
President’s request was normal, and it
was necessary. But what is really not
necessary is the level of the anti-
Trump hysteria that has come from
the left.
The first order of business in this
new Congress should be to secure the
border and, yes, to open the govern-
ment. The President is willing to
strike a deal, but he just needs a few
Democrats to join him at the table and
put our country before the new Demo-
crat majority’s politics.
Sadly, the bill on the floor today
does nothing to secure our border, nor
does it strengthen our Nation’s secu-
rity. The bill before us is nothing more
than just a political stunt.
If you still don’t believe me, I will
just point out this bill does not include
any of the bipartisan product that my
committee put together last year with
the help of Congressman MIKE QUIGLEY
on the Financial Services and General
Government Appropriations Sub-
committee, which included more than
100 pages of bipartisan product that we
worked on together. None of these re-
forms were included. It also included
the Fund for America’s Kids and
Grandkids, which is a revolutionary
idea to save money for future genera-
tions.
b 1945
But just hours ago, in her acceptance
speech, the Speaker referred to the
children of this great country and se-
curing their futures. So why doesn’t
this bill, the one that is before us to-
night, include anything for America’s
kids and grandkids?
Furthermore, this bill is nothing
more than a Senate bill. The Speaker
of the House is supposed to fight for
the House position and not just be a
floor leader for the Senate majority.
I urge my friends on the other side of
the aisle to put politics aside. Let’s
come to the table. Let’s get this done.
Working together, we can secure the
border; we can protect the citizens of
this country; and yes, we can reopen
this government. The American people
are counting on us. This is what they
elected us to do here today.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote
on this bill.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, before
I yield to my next speaker, I just want
to say to the gentleman from Georgia
that I strongly believe we have a re-
sponsibility to keep the government
open, so it is really unfortunate that
the President has taken a strong posi-
tion in closing the government down. I
hope we can continue our discussions
and open the government for the Amer-
ican people.
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
BISHOP), the chairman-designate of the
Agriculture, Rural Development, Food
and Drug Administration, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding.
Madam Speaker, we are now in the
13th day of a partial government shut-
down. Vital government services that
the public relies on have slowed or
stopped altogether. Specifically, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture has
stopped issuing loans for rural develop-
ment and grants for housing and com-
munity facilities. New grant payments
for agriculture research cannot be
made. Across the Nation, Farm Service
Agency county offices closed on De-
cember 28. Furthermore, farmers ap-
plying for relief from retaliatory tar-
iffs are in limbo, waiting for the shut-
down to end.
The bill before us today is a serious
effort to end this needless shutdown
and get the government back to work
for the American people.
The agriculture section is virtually
identical to legislation that the Senate
passed last August by a vote of 92–6.
This impressive, bipartisan vote is the
result of the Senate agreeing to work
constructively to develop their bills.
This bill is not perfect—no bill ever
is—but, again, this is a serious bill that
will get the government working again
for the American people.
Not only are we in the middle of a
needless shutdown, but we are already
4 months into fiscal year 2019. Federal
agencies and departments deserve cer-
tainty and stability. As we begin a new
Congress, I hope we can renew our com-
mitment to responsibly fund the gov-
ernment.
This bill provides $3.8 billion for
rural development. These much-needed
resources will help communities that
face broadband, housing, water and
wastewater, and healthcare challenges.
The legislation provides an additional
$425 million for rural broadband expan-
sion, continuing our commitment to
bridge the digital divide.
It responsibly funds the McGovern-
Dole and Food for Peace programs that
provide essential food to help keep
children in school and help feed hungry
people abroad.
It provides $2.7 billion in agricultural
research, which is an increase of $114
million above the FY 2018 enacted
level.
It funds the Farm Service Agency at
$1.6 million, and it funds the Natural
Resources Conservation Service at
$879.1 million.
The bill provides $73.2 billion in man-
datory funding for the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program, which
will soon begin to run out of funding if
action is not taken soon. Last year,
SNAP helped more than 42 million peo-
ple, and it is widely considered an effi-
cient and successful safety net that of-
fers desperately needed support to
those in need.
Finally, the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration is funded at $2.97 billion, and
the Commodity Futures Trading Com-
mission is funded at the requested level
of $281.5 million.
Farmers, ranchers, and producers go
to work every morning. So should their
government. I urge my colleagues to
support this bill.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX).
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank my colleague from
Texas for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 21, the Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act of 2019. This bill

would allow taxpayers to fund abor-
tions in foreign countries.
H.R. 21 would repeal President Don-
ald Trump’s Protecting Life and Global
Health Assistance Policy. This impor-
tant policy, formally known as the
Mexico City policy, protects American
taxpayers and prohibits U.S. inter-
national assistance from going to for-
eign NGOs that promote or perform
abortions.
It is critical that America’s foreign
policy reflect the values of the Amer-
ican people. A 2017 Marist Poll clearly
revealed that an overwhelming major-
ity of Americans oppose using their
hard-earned tax dollars to support
abortions in other countries. American
taxpayers should not be expected to
pay for something they so strongly op-
pose.
The Protecting Life and Global
Health Assistance Policy is not anti-
global health nor is it anti-family plan-
ning. It does not reduce funding avail-
able for international health assistance
and leaves the choice up to the indi-
vidual NGOs of whether or not they
wish to be eligible for Federal grant
money.
Abortion should never be considered
a necessary part of economic growth,
and organizations that believe it is
should not be the type of organizations
that the United States partners with.
Abortion is wrong. We do not allow
taxpayer money to be spent on abor-
tions within the United States, and we
certainly should not fund it in other
countries.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY), the distin-
guished chairman-designate of the Fi-
nancial Services and General Govern-
ment Subcommittee.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I am
reminding myself, after listening to
my colleagues, of how we really got
here.
Yes, this is a Senate bill. The Senate
had a bicameral, bipartisan approach
to this. They were told they could go
home for a reason. Apparently, the
President saw something he didn’t like
on TV.
So here we are. And what do we have
to show for it?
More than 800,000 Federal employees
are left wondering when their next pay-
check is going to arrive, forced to
choose between paying their mortgage
or their child’s daycare; financial mar-
kets and businesses are rattled by a
President who is willing to throw the
economy into chaos over his own pride;
and American families are deprived of
vital government services they rely on.
As the chairman-designate of the Fi-
nancial Services and General Govern-
ment Subcommittee on Appropria-
tions, I have seen firsthand how this
shutdown is impacting communities
around the country. For example, the
doors to the Small Business Adminis-
tration are shut. This means a com-
plete halt to the processing of Federal
loan assistance applications for small
businesses, which typically amount to
$1 billion per month.
We have more than 300 million small
businesses in our communities, thou-
sands of which apply every month for
Federal loan assistance, and we are
failing them. We talk about supporting
job creation and ensuring small busi-
nesses can grow, but when a business
owner cannot get a loan approved, that
is a broken promise.
At the IRS, tens of thousands of em-
ployees who are supposed to be ready
to answer taxpayers’ questions and to
process tax returns are, instead, fur-
loughed, leaving the phones to con-
tinue ringing unanswered as we move
into the 2018 filing season.
The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission, the agency responsible for po-
licing Wall Street, has furloughed 94
percent of its staff. It is now preparing
to scale back law enforcement and liti-
gation efforts, putting at risk the safe-
ty and stability of our markets.
These are just three agencies. The
list goes on.
The bill that is before us today to
fund the agencies covered by the Fi-
nancial Services and General Govern-
ment Appropriations bill is not the bill
I would have written myself. I am dis-
appointed that, after securing funding
last year to help States better defend
their election systems, we were unable
to lock down additional money for next
year.
The overwhelming demand for assist-
ance is clearly there, as every single
State and eligible territory requested
funding. However, even though the
President and many of my Republican
colleagues refuse to do what is needed
to defend our election systems from
foreign interference, we must do what
is right and what is responsible. That
is why I am still going to support this
bill. Ultimately, it will do the
foundational job the American people
expect us to do.
This bill provides resources for our
core government operations to resume
and function properly, whether it is the
Federal Communications Commission,
the National Archives, the Federal ju-
diciary, or Federal drug control offices.
It is time—13 days past time—to end
the ego trips and nonsense and get
back to work.
I believe we should always strive for
bipartisanship when we can. That is ex-
actly what the Senate did when they
overwhelmingly passed the bills we are
voting on tonight.
While I would never ask my col-
leagues, whether Democrat or Repub-
lican, to cave on their core convictions,
that is exactly what the President and
House Republicans are asking us to do
by wasting over $5 billion on an ineffec-
tive border wall that has come to serve
one purpose alone: to symbolize hate,
exclusion, and irrational fear.
This is clearly not how you negotiate
a deal in good faith, and it is never ap-
propriate to hold paychecks and vital
government services hostage as a
dealmaking tactic. Stop covering for
the President as he doubles down on
his reckless mistake. Pass these Sen-
ate-supported bills, and provide Amer-
ican families, businesses, and commu-
nities with the certainty they deserve.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. HARRIS).
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from Texas for
yielding.
Madam Speaker, we are less than 8
hours into this new Congress. We heard
a promise from the Speaker today
about transparency, openness, and,
maybe, regular order; yet we have a
bill in front of us, one of the most
major bills we would consider the en-
tire year, that has not gone through
the committee process. In fact, it was
drawn up behind closed doors, with no
debate. We have dozens of new Mem-
bers, none of whom are allowed input
into this product because it didn’t
come through the committee process.
What if some of these changes are
made?
We had a bill that had come through
the process, but there were changes
made. The gentlewoman from North
Carolina talked about one of them: the
fact that many, many Americans—the
majority of Americans—feel we already
spend too much on foreign aid.
This bill says we are now going to
change our policy from the last few
years, and we are now going to spend
money to fund abortion programs in
foreign countries for the purpose of
family planning—not for medical pur-
poses, but for the purposes of family
planning. The vast majority of Ameri-
cans would disagree and say, with a $22
trillion debt, we probably shouldn’t be
spending money overseas funding abor-
tions for family planning.
We may have gotten a chance to de-
bate this in committee, but we didn’t.
Less than 8 hours into the session, we
have a major bill on the floor and no
debate.
But it goes further than that. It re-
stores funding to the United Nations
Population Fund. In committee, we
should have had a debate about the
United Nations Population Fund and
how, in fact, it funds China’s coercive
forced sterilization and forced abortion
policy.
Is that what the United States is
about: sending money overseas for
forced sterilization and forced abor-
tion?
That discussion belongs in com-
mittee. It doesn’t belong, again, added
to a bill under the dark of night, with
no discussion.
It goes further. It increases funding
for international family planning and
encourages targeting areas of the world
‘‘where population growth threatens
biodiversity and endangered species.’’
It doesn’t mention anything about
human life or the value of human life
here. It talks about every other species
in the environment as if they are more

important than human life, a very in-
teresting approach to take, but an ap-
proach that probably should have been
discussed in committee first.
Finally, as a physician, it removes
the protective language that says that
the District of Columbia should not, in
fact, promote Jack Kevorkian-style,
physician-assisted suicide; because,
Madam Speaker, if you can’t trust
your figures to make each and every
judgment in your best interest, not the
interest of an HMO that can save
money or an insurance company that
can save money or the organization
that physician works for that can save
money if that person agrees to take a
suicide-producing drug prescribed by
that physician, if we go down that slip-
pery slope, I don’t want to know where
we end.
Madam Speaker, this bill should have
come through the committee process.
It should have gone through debate.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, before
I yield to my next speaker, I would like
to remind the gentleman from Mary-
land that this bill was supported by
MITCH MCCONNELL and LINDSEY GRA-
HAM, among other Senators; therefore,
he might want to take up his issues
with them.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from South Carolina
(Mr. CLYBURN), the majority whip.
b 2000
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding me
this time and thank her so much for
her service to this great Nation.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this bill to reopen the govern-
ment. For the past 2 weeks, vital pub-
lic services have been left undone and
honorable public servants have been
left unpaid. We must end the shameless
shutdown.
The Democratic majority has a dis-
agreement with the President on
whether a wall is the best way to se-
cure our southern border and whether
it would be a productive step toward
fixing our broken immigration system.
We will continue to debate the issue,
as we should, but there is absolutely no
reason why the Federal Government
should not be serving the American
people while we debate this issue.
There is absolutely no reason why
national parks shouldn’t be main-
tained. There is absolutely no reason
why museums should be closed. There
is no reason why public officer training
should cease. There is absolutely no
reason why our economy should grow
by $2 billion less every week, as econo-
mists have estimated. There is abso-
lutely no reason why homeowners and
small business owners shouldn’t be able
to receive loans in a timely manner.
The American people voted for a di-
vided government, but they did not
vote for a defunct government. Over
the next 2 years, we must not let our
disagreements stop us from moving for-
ward on issues where we do agree.
Madam Speaker, I have been spend-
ing a lot of time in recent weeks re-
reading a great book, ‘‘Democracy in
America,’’ written by Alexis de
Tocqueville; and although many histo-
rians disagree as to whether or not de
Tocqueville ever really said it, the fact
of the matter is, he is credited with
having said that the reason America is
a great Nation is because the American
people are good people. And he con-
cluded that if the American people ever
ceased to be good, America would cease
to be great.
The fact of the matter is, this shut-
ting down the government, not paying
public servants, and not giving vital
services to people and communities
who need them is demonstrative of the
fact that Americans are losing their
goodness.
Let’s not do that. It will cause the
greatness of this Nation to be brought
into danger.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE).
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman, my friend
from Texas, for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise on this first
day of the 116th Congress with, frankly,
a great deal of disappointment in my
friends across the aisle. In the very
first act of their new majority, Demo-
crats have passed a set of rules to allow
the debt limit to be raised automati-
cally, to remove protections that pre-
vent tax hikes on the American people,
and to weaken the requirement that
offsets be provided when Federal spend-
ing is increased.
It is clear my colleagues have chosen
to focus more on tax-and-spend prior-
ities rather than fiscal responsibility
and accountability.
As a part of this same first act, my
friends across the aisle are now circum-
venting regular order and bringing new
spending legislation straight to the
floor for a vote, with no opportunity
for debate or ability to offer amend-
ments.
As someone who has served on both
the Committee on Rules and the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, I have heard
firsthand, repeatedly, my colleagues
across the aisle shout the importance
of going through regular order and al-
lowing debate and amendments on
these bills.
With this move today, the very first
act in their majority, the Democrats
are cutting the Rules Committee and
the Appropriations Committee com-
pletely out of the process.
The legislation before us never had a
hearing, was never marked up, never
came to the Rules Committee for a
vote. Most disappointingly, Democrats
have negated the bills crafted carefully
by the Appropriations Committee over
the past year and thrown out legisla-
tive provisions that were negotiated
and agreed upon by both sides of the
aisle.
Madam Speaker, I look forward to
the opportunity to work to find com-
mon ground with my colleagues in the
majority, but today I am sincerely dis-
appointed in these first moves of the
116th Congress.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER).
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I
rise in opposition to H.R. 21, the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2019, for
many reasons but, importantly, be-
cause the underlying legislation strips
away essential protections for young
mothers and unborn babies, dis-
regarding the value of their lives.
Today’s minibus eliminates a crucial
pro-life foreign policy that is in place
today known as the Protecting Life in
Global Health Assistance program.
President Ronald Reagan instituted
this policy to provide healthcare for
women in foreign countries while en-
suring that U.S. taxpayer dollars would
not be used to fuel the national abor-
tion industry.
U.S. foreign assistance should be life
affirming. The Protecting Life in Glob-
al Health Assistance policy draws a
clear line between abortion and global
healthcare.
Foreign nongovernmental organiza-
tions should be eligible for U.S. Fed-
eral funding as long as they do not per-
form or actively promote abortion as a
method of birth control. Protecting
Life in Global Health Assistance af-
firms the inherent worth and dignity of
women and children around the world,
and it is tragic that today’s bill nul-
lifies these pro-life protections.
So, because of that, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting against
H.R. 21.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN).
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from Texas for
her leadership.
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition
to H.R. 21, which repeals the Pro-
tecting Life in Global Health Assist-
ance policy. This is a commonsense
policy that simply guarantees that
U.S. taxpayer dollars do not promote
or perform abortions overseas.
Organizations such as International
Planned Parenthood and Marie Stopes
International are responsible for mil-
lions of abortions overseas every year,
and they do not deserve support from
American taxpayers.
Taxpayer dollars are better spent on
the health of children and mothers and
on malaria and HIV prevention and
treatment rather than on snuffing out
the lives of unborn children.
It is amazing that, on their first day
of taking power, House Democrats are
pushing an extreme position far to the
left. American taxpayers simply don’t
want to fund abortions with their hard-
earned dollars, and it is even more
amazing that this exercise is being per-
formed on a bill that will not be

brought up in the Senate and will not
be signed by the President. It is a bill
that is going nowhere.
Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose
the repeal of this life-affirming provi-
sion, and I urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘no’’ on H.R. 21.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I just
want to make something perfectly
clear.
The United States does not and can-
not fund abortions. Let me say that
again. The United States does not and
cannot fund abortions, period.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, I rise to share a deep concern
that I and many of my colleagues share
about H.R. 21.
If what our colleague said is true,
then we should just take this provision
out of the bill. To revise or rescind the
Mexico City policy would do precisely
the opposite of what the gentlewoman
just said at the podium.
In 1984, President Ronald Reagan
made a strong international stance for
life. He announced that the United
States would carry on the tradition of
protecting the innocent, not only at
home but around the globe. With this
promise, the United States would no
longer allow taxpayer dollars to be
sent overseas to promote abortion as a
method for family planning. That is
what this policy does.
We are thankful for the countless
lives that have been saved because of
President Reagan’s willingness to em-
brace the innocent, and I remain
thankful to President Trump for car-
rying on this proud legacy.
Unfortunately, Protecting Life in
Global Health Assistance is now at
risk. In the legislation before us today,
the new Democratic leadership has
moved to overturn this important pol-
icy that was just articulated.
Let us say this clearly. The United
States should never underwrite abor-
tions. Taxpayers deserve better, chil-
dren deserve better, and families de-
serve better. We must continue to be
the shining light on the hill to protect
the innocent and assist women and
children in their time of need.
What a shame it would be if the very
first action in the 116th Congress is to
send foreign aid to fund abortions over-
seas.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Indiana (Mr. BANKS).
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I too
rise in strong opposition to the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2019,
H.R. 21.
I am appalled that the very first ini-
tiative by this Democratic majority is
to push for taxpayer-funded subsidies
to international organizations that
promote and perform abortions.
Madam Speaker, this bill would re-
peal President Trump’s Protecting Life
in Global Health Assistance policy, or
the expanded Mexico City policy,
which prohibits global health funding
from going to foreign NGOs that per-
form or promote abortion.
Madam Speaker, the expanded Mex-
ico City policy does not change the
amount of money available for global
health and family planning programs.
In fact, all qualified international fam-
ily planning organizations are eligible
for U.S. grant money if they agree to
set conditions upon acceptance.
The choice has been up to the NGO;
either agree not to perform or promote
abortions or forego funding from the
United States.
A 6-month review of the policy by the
State Department found that, out of
733 prime partners eligible for U.S.
grant money, only 4 of them declined
to the conditions set by the expanded
Mexico City policy.
Madam Speaker, a vote in support of
this minibus is a vote to abandon the
principle that U.S. foreign assistance
should be life affirming; it should sup-
port the health of both women and un-
born children.
Abortion is not healthcare. Madam
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote
‘‘no’’ on this bill and uphold the Pro-
tecting Life in Global Health Assist-
ance policy.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the
bill before us today, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
It is long past time to end the Trump
shutdown. As our first legislative act
of the year, we should isolate the polit-
ical dispute over border security and
reopen the government.
There is simply no reason the Senate
should not pass the package, given that
they wrote the six full-year bills and
passed a CR through February.
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 5, the
previous question is ordered on the bill.
The question is on the engrossment
and third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
have a motion to recommit at the
desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentlewoman opposed to the bill?
Ms. GRANGER. I am in its current
form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Ms. Granger moves to recommit the bill
H.R. 21 to the Committee on Appropriations
with instructions to report the same back to
the House forthwith, with the following
amendment:
Page 1021, strike line 15 and all that fol-
lows through page 1023, line 19 (and redesig-
nate subsequent sections accordingly).
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas is recognized for
5 minutes.
b 2015
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, this
is the final amendment to the bill,
which will not kill the bill or send it
back to committee. If adopted, the bill
will immediately proceed to final pas-
sage, as amended.
This motion to recommit strikes the
section of the Department of State,
Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams Appropriations Act that re-
verses the President’s Protecting Life
and Global Health Assistance Policy,
formerly known as the Mexico City
Policy. This policy is important to pro-
tect life and must be maintained.
The bill also mandates that funds be
made available for UNFPA, and this
motion to recommit strikes that re-
quirement. The administration has de-
termined that this United Nations
agency has violated certain provisions
of law. No fund should go to UNFPA.
We must support this motion to recom-
mit and amend the bill before us to en-
sure that pro-life policies are main-
tained.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam
Speaker, if reopening the government
is the goal, if ending the shutdown is
the goal, why does this appropriations
package contain a brand-new poison
pill rider, section 7071, that overturns a
major, comprehensive, current-day
pro-life policy?
Let’s be clear. The Protecting Life
and Global Health Assistance Policy is
eviscerated by this bill. The Protecting
Life Policy, Madam Speaker, is a sig-
nificant reiteration and expansion of
President Ronald Reagan’s Mexico City
policy, which was first announced back
in 1984, and that policy was and is de-
signed to ensure that U.S. taxpayer
money is not funneled to foreign non-
governmental organizations that per-
form or promote abortion as a method
of family planning.
The policy done by Trump 2 years
ago establishes pro-child safeguards
that are benign and humane condi-
tions. It is about protection of these in-
nocent children who might otherwise
die from chemical poisoning or by dis-

For years, pro-abortion organizations
have used U.S. taxpayer funds to weak-
en, undermine, or reverse pro-life laws
in other nations and destroy precious
lives of these children.
The Speaker earlier today admon-
ished us to protect God’s creation.
These unborn children are God’s cre-

grant money—should consistently af-
firm, care for, and tangibly assist
women and children, including the un-
born child.
Let’s not forget, no one is expendable
or a throwaway. Every human life has
imminent value. Birth is merely an
event, not the beginning of the life of a
child. Taxpayers should not be forced
to fund the organizations that are pro-
moting abortion overseas.
This allows us—and it doesn’t reduce
global humanitarian aid, global health
aid by so much as a dollar. It just is
who we give it to does matter, and if
they have an agenda of taking the lives
of these precious children, we would
give it to someone else, and we do so on
a dollar-for-dollar basis.
I thank my good friend for yielding,
and I hope that everyone will support
the Granger motion to recommit.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of
this motion, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
in opposition to the motion to recom-
mit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, re-
sponsibly funding the Federal Govern-
ment is one of the most important du-
ties of Congress. The previous majority
failed to do so, and they failed to do
the most basic task of keeping the
lights on. Here on day one of the 116th
Congress, we Democrats are here to re-
open Federal agencies shuttered by the
Trump shutdown.
This legislation, which has already
garnered strong bipartisan support in
the Senate, will ensure that the Fed-
eral Government is open and working
for the American people.
The House package includes the iden-
tical provisions relating to inter-
national family planning that were in-
cluded in the State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs bill that
was reported unanimously by the Sen-
ate Appropriations Committee 6
months ago, including ‘‘aye’’ votes by
Senators MCCONNELL and GRAHAM. The
bill continues the longstanding prohi-
bition on the use of U.S. funds for abor-
tion.
The President’s executive order goes
beyond existing U.S. law and forces the
United States to withhold critical fam-
ily planning assistance from non-
governmental organizations with ex-
pertise, capacity, and proven track
records on supporting women’s health
around the globe.
The Mexico City policy, or the global
gag rule, is a harmful policy that hurts
women and families around the world.
The President’s expanded policy pre-
vents women from around the world
from gaining access to essential infor-
mation and healthcare services.
We are already on the 13th day of the
Trump shutdown. We need to pass
these bills without further delay. For
that reason, Madam Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to reject this motion to
recommit and vote ‘‘no.’’
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that

Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, on

The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H191
January 3, 2019
Madam Speaker, today is the begin-
ning of the 116th Congress. The first
and most basic responsibility this
House has is to reopen our government
to serve the needs of the American peo-
ple. The greatest obstacle in keeping
the government open has been dis-
agreements on how to spend Homeland
Security dollars. That is why, in the
best interests of the country, it makes
sense to reopen the government by
passing the remaining six bipartisan
funding bills for fiscal year 2019 and to
reopen the Department of Homeland
Security through a short-term con-
tinuing resolution.
The resolution before us would do
just that. It would reopen the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security through
February 8 of this year. This would
give us time to negotiate a DHS fund-
ing bill for the rest of the fiscal year
based on the most current needs assess-
ment, such as meeting the housing
needs of children in border custody.
The ability to reach a full-year fund-
ing bill for the Department of Home-
land Security will not be possible, how-
ever, if the President is unwilling to
change his focus from a campaign
promise to one that realistically ad-
dresses the most urgent and immediate
national security vulnerabilities our
homeland faces today.
This means any serious discussion of
Homeland Security investments must
include funding for hiring more law en-
forcement agents to focus on opioid,
gang, trade, and child exploitation in-
vestigations; funding for the hiring of
additional customs officers to inter-
cept illicit drugs and other contraband,
almost all of which comes into our
country through the ports of entry.
It must also include investing more
in first responder grants to better pre-
pare States and localities to prevent
and respond to terrorism and disasters
of every kind.
It must contain funding for the re-
capitalization of the Coast Guard’s air
and sea fleets, including funding for
the procurement of our first heavy ice-
breaker since the 1970s, because, as the
Arctic ice recedes, Russia, China, and
other countries are winning the race to
lay claim to the vast resources of that
region.
While border security is important, it
is only one of many pieces of the
Homeland Security mission, which in-
cludes criminal investigations, first re-
sponder preparedness, disaster re-
sponse, the protection of our cyber net-
works, and the protection of our crit-
ical infrastructure, coastal waters, and
our air and surface transportation sys-
tems. These must also be funding prior-
ities if we are to protect our homeland.
Yet every dollar set aside for a border
wall is a dollar lost to our ability to
meet these and our other most pressing
and critical Homeland Security needs.
I urge my House colleagues to sup-
port this resolution, and I urge the
Senate to do the same, so we can
quickly get to work on negotiating a
full-year funding bill in support of the
critical work of the Department of
Homeland Security.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, today I rise in oppo-
sition to H.J. Res. 1. Again, this bill
put forward by the new Democratic
leadership fails to secure our border.
The President has said that he will not
sign it. The Senate has said they will
not consider it.
This plan ignores one of the main re-
sponsibilities of the Congress, which is
to protect the American people.
Every day, there are an average of
2,100 illegal crossings at our southern
border. According to the Department of
Homeland Security, over 17,000 crimi-
nals were apprehended at the border
last year.
From human traffickers to drug
smugglers to suspected terrorists,
these criminal illegal immigrants rep-
resent a clear threat to the safety and
security of our homeland.
b 2030
The situation at the border is a cri-
sis, not only for border States like my
home State of Texas, but for our entire
country. We owe it to the American
people to work together to address this
problem and secure our border.
As the leader of the Speaker’s Work-
ing Group on the Border Crisis in 2014,
I had the opportunity to travel mul-
tiple times to our southern border and
to the countries from where the major-
ity of unaccompanied minors were
coming. Not only did I talk to the lead-
ership of each country, but I talked
with many of the people who are send-
ing their children to the United States.
In addition to the crime and violence
created by the cartels, I was told time
and time again that the reason people
and children were risking their lives to
come to the United States was because
of the lack of enforcement of our immi-
gration laws and our unsecured bor-
ders.
In order to discourage people from
taking the treacherous and often dead-
ly trip to the United States, it is vital
that they know that we will enforce
our immigration laws and that the bor-
der is secure.
It is time to end the political games-
manship and get to work on a bill that
will reopen the government and fund
border security. I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, how much time do I have re-
maining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 11 min-
utes remaining.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentleman from Mississippi
(Mr. THOMPSON), the chairman of the
Committee on Homeland Security.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support
of the new Democratic majority’s ef-
forts to reopen the Department of
Homeland Security.
Since the government shutdown on
December 21, roughly 2.5 million holi-
day travelers each day have passed
through airport security checkpoints
staffed by Transportation Security Ad-
ministration officers who aren’t get-
ting paid.
As we speak, 87 percent of the DHS
workforce is reporting to work without
pay and without knowing when the
next paycheck will come. These are fel-
low Americans with bills to pay and
families to support. The President
should not be treating them like pawns
in his pathetic pursuit to fulfill an ab-
surd campaign promise.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD a New York Times article
dated January 3, 2019.
[From the New York Times, Jan. 3, 2019]
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN LEAVES WORKERS
REELING: ‘‘WE SEEM TO BE PAWNS’’
(By Campbell Robertson, Mitch Smith and
Alan Blinder)
No sooner had the news of an impasse come
out of a meeting room in Washington than
thousands of miles away, on an island in the
Pacific, Tomas Kaselionis had to start mak-
ing decisions.
‘‘For me, it’s do I consider a car payment
or do I pay the gas bill or the phone bill?’’
said Mr. Kaselionis, who is working on ty-
phoon recovery for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, unpaid and far from
home in the United States commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands. ‘‘Those are
conversations within the next week that I
have to have with my wife.’’
By Saturday, the federal government will
have been shut down for two weeks, a full
pay cycle for federal workers. If the shut-
down lasts through Monday, it will surpass
the one of 2013, and if it lasts beyond the fol-
lowing Saturday, it will be the longest shut-
down in United States history. Politicians
have said they were hopeful that the standoff
could be over in a matter of ‘‘days and
weeks,’’ a reassurance that rang hollow to
hundreds of thousands of federal workers
who were not getting paid.
‘‘They have to realize that this affects ev-
eryday people,’’ said Ray Coleman Jr., a cor-
rections officer who teaches G.E.D. classes at
a federal prison in Florida and is president of
his local union. ‘‘It affects the boots on the
ground. To me, it’s like a political chess
game that they’re playing, and we seem to
be pawns.’’
By Thursday, fallout from the shutdown
was spreading fast. The chairman of the Fed-
eral Communications Commission an-
nounced on Twitter that the agency would
‘‘suspend most operations.’’
Federal court proceedings, to the irritation
of judges, slowed as government lawyers
asked for stays. The Justice Department
asked to delay a hearing on a suit brought by
the N.A.A.C.P. over the Trump administra-
tion’s census preparations. And a much-an-
ticipated E.P.A. hearing on lead contamina-
tion in East Chicago, Ind., was canceled.
All the while, claims for unemployment
benefits were piling up; the District of Co-
lumbia said it had received about 900 claims
connected to the shutdown, and the state of
Maryland counted 637 at midweek. More
than 350 federal workers in Colorado had
filed unemployment claims.
‘‘People are, to be frank, a little pissed,’’
said Daniel A. Sobien, a meteorologist with
the National Weather Service in Tampa,

Fla., who has been furloughed and is living
on savings. ‘‘They’re tired of being political
pawns. I realize that unfair things happen to
people all the time, but it really is unfair
that because of politics, government employ-
ees have to shoulder the burden.’’
The impasse may be centered within a few
blocks in Washington, D.C., but the federal
work force shouldering the burden is spread
across the country—fewer than one in five
federal workers are in the Washington statis-
tical area. Among the 800,000 federal workers
affected are people with doctorates earning
$100,000 a year and those making a quarter of
that; workers in labs and workers in prisons;
people who clean up majestic national parks
and people who clean up cramped offices in
the early morning hours.
Among these workers, there was a widely
shared sentiment of frustration, even dis-
gust, that the people in charge seemed to
lack concern for the people who actually
keep the government working.
‘‘It’s indefensible to not appreciate the role
and responsibility that there is to make sure
the government runs smoothly,’’ said A. Ash-
ley Tabaddor, a federal immigration judge in
Los Angeles and president of the National
Association of Immigration Judges, who is
currently on furlough.
Brian Turner, an officer with the Transpor-
tation Security Administration at the Phila-
delphia airport, said he has for six years en-
joyed being ‘‘the last line of defense’’ for peo-
ple getting on airplanes. He endured a 16-day
shutdown in 2013, but at the time did not
have a house or a family, and the politics
back then, as fierce as they were, just
seemed more predictable, he said.
‘‘I love working for the country,’’ he said.
But, he added, ‘‘I can’t go two months with-
out a paycheck.’’
About 420,000 of the workers affected are
classified as essential and have been working
without knowing when they will next be
paid. About 380,000 federal workers have been
furloughed. Unions and federal agencies have
not provided demographic information about
the workers affected, but have said that the
group is generally similar to the broader fed-
eral work force, some 2.1 million non-
military workers.
The work force is spread out nationally,
with thousands of federal employees in every
state, tens of thousands in states like Geor-
gia, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, and the
highest percentage in California. According
to officials at unions which represent federal
employees, the shutdown seemed to be af-
fecting workers outside of the Washington,
D.C. area most severely.
Less-populated areas may be hit dispropor-
tionately hard, including small towns such
as Pollock, La., where the biggest employer
is a federal penitentiary.
‘‘Our members get an average take-home
pay of $500 a week, and next week they aren’t
going to get that,’’ said J. David Cox Sr.,
president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, which represents
about 40,000 Bureau of Prisons employees
who have been furloughed in the shutdown.
‘‘The places that are getting slammed are
the ones, like Pollock, that you can’t find
with a GPS.’’
In addition to the federal workers, thou-
sands of people who work for contractors—
cleaning offices or serving food—are missing
wages, but are not considered in proposed
legislation that promises back pay once a
deal is worked out.
‘‘Just to think about it, it’s so fright-
ening,’’ said Donna Kelly, a contracted secu-
rity guard who works—or did work, before
the museums closed on Wednesday—at the
Smithsonian Institution. She had applied for
unemployment benefits, but was still wait-
ing for her application to be processed. ‘‘I
really don’t know what I’ll do until I’m actu-
ally feeling the pressure.’’
Nearly all of those affected, the contrac-
tors, furloughed employees and employees
who were working without pay, were experi-
encing a growing, gnawing anxiety. They
were keeping track of the news: Mr. Trump’s
demands for a border wall, the daily shifts
over terms of an imaginable deal, the vows
by Democrats and Republicans not to budge.
But many said they were doing so simply to
find out if they could pay mortgages, plan
vacations or take care of car payments.
‘‘I don’t think anybody who works for the
government is worried about if this wall gets
built or not,’’ said La-Shanda Palmer, a
T.S.A. employee in Philadelphia. ‘‘They
want to go back to work.’’ She was con-
cerned about paying her bills and racking up
late fees, and providing for her family. She
said she called her utility company hoping
for an accommodation; she did not get a
break.
‘‘Right now, the stress level is at 1,000,’’
said Kutonya King, a correctional counselor
at the federal prison in Jesup, Ga. Like other
corrections officers, Ms. King said she was
concerned about the safety of the inmates
and of her fellow workers, who will have
more and more to occupy their minds if the
shutdown drags on. An officer at another
prison wondered how many of her colleagues
would end up staying home because they
could not afford gas.
Still, Ms. King said some inmates had of-
fered sympathy. That seemed to be more
than workers were hearing from Washington.
‘‘I don’t particularly blame a particular
party; I think it’s across the board,’’ Ms.
King said. ‘‘They need to think about the
people.’’
Ms. King has been making plans in case
the shutdown lasts the promised days and
weeks, having already canceled a long-
planned family trip for the holidays. She
may need that money to pay bills, she said.
Later on Thursday afternoon, back in
Washington, a key Republican senator sug-
gested to reporters a new possible timeline
for the shutdown: ‘‘months and months.’’
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Madam Speaker, I have served on this
committee since its inception and have
spent more than a decade working with
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle
to identify and invest in effective ways
to secure the border. That is why I find
the President’s bizarre obsession with
wasting billions of dollars on building a
wall so confounding. There is abso-
lutely no evidence that a wall spanning
the U.S.-Mexico border will make
America safer.
While I am at it, there is similarly no
evidence that separating children from
their families or implementing harsh
asylum restrictions makes America
safer either, but the Trump adminis-
tration has forced DHS to pursue such
cruel, costly, and inhumane policies.
The kinds of threats America faces
today transcend physical borders. The
President needs to learn that and ad-
just his priorities accordingly.
Last fall, Secretary Nielsen declared
that cyberattacks and sophisticated
hacking are the biggest threats to the
United States. Yet, today, almost half
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency workforce is fur-
loughed, and the rest are working with-
out pay because the President is fix-
ated on his wall.
According to one official: ‘‘CISA has
ceased a variety of critical cybersecu-
rity and infrastructure protection ca-
pabilities.’’
I am disturbed that the President
does not appear to understand that his
actions have stalled progress on secur-
ing vulnerable networks.
Moreover, the uncertainty as to when
workers will be paid is also counter-
productive.
Madam Speaker, I am disappointed
that we are forced to spend the first
days of the 116th Congress on the unfin-
ished business of the 115th Congress in-
stead of addressing priorities that
Americans elected us to tackle in No-
vember, but this is where we find our-
selves.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. I yield the
gentleman an additional 15 seconds.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. The
American public needs Congress to be
the grownups in the room. I urge my
colleagues to support this short-term
spending bill so we can pay the DHS
employees charged with protecting the
homeland.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN).
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speak-
er, I respectfully and strongly rise
today in strong opposition to the pro-
posal from my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle to reopen the govern-
ment without increased funding for
border security.
Let me be clear: This attempt to re-
open our government without in-
creased border security funding is dan-
gerous, flawed, and truly puts party be-
fore country.
We can all agree that our country is
in crisis, as our porous borders, our po-
rous southern border, allow dangerous
criminals, deadly drugs, and human
trafficking to pour into our country al-
most unchecked.
So why do my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle continue to
refuse to take real action and do some-
thing about it?
Just the other day, there was another
tragedy where the police reported an
individual who had come here illegally
took the life of a police officer. That
police officer left his family as a patri-
otic American dedicated to enforcing
the rule of law and, as a result, lost his
life.
How many more times does this have
to happen before my colleagues on the
other side of this aisle support in-
creased border security?
In short, we need the wall.
Madam Speaker, my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle say that
walls don’t work. Let me assure you,
they do. According to the Department
of Homeland Security, there have been
significant decreases along our south-
ern border where walls and fencing
have been built. Look at Yuma, Ari-
zona, where illegal traffic has dropped
95 percent, 95 percent over 9 years, or

El Paso, Texas, where illegal traffic

Madam Speaker, House Republicans
took a stand on December 5 to secure
our Nation by passing a bill that in-
cluded $5.7 billion in border security.
That was the President’s full request
for the wall. This bill is central to ful-
filling our promise as elected officials
to protect the American people, ensure
the safety of our Nation, and put
American interests first. To reopen the
government without necessary border
security funding and wall funding is a
sorely missed opportunity.
Madam Speaker, let’s get back to
work negotiating and take up legisla-
tion that secures our southern border,
funds the wall, and strengthens our Na-
tion.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR), a
longtime member of the Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Homeland Se-
curity.
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker,
look, everybody talks about the border
and how violent it is. But if you look
at the latest FBI statistics, whether it
is rape, murder, or assault, the border
crime rate is lower than the national
crime rate. I can pick any city that
you want, and you will see that none of
the most dangerous cities in the coun-
try are on the border, none of them.
None of them are.
In fact, if you look at my hometown
of Laredo, the murder rate on the bor-
der, and you compare it to Washington,
D.C., where we are, it is about three or
four times higher here in Washington,
D.C. If people are worried about the
crime, start off with Washington, D.C.,
if that is what y’all want to do.
The wall is a 14th century solution to
a 21st century issue that we have. We
want to see strong border security. I
live on the border. I don’t just go visit
for a second or 2 hours and say that I
know the border better. I know what
works down there, and the wall is a
14th century solution.
If you want to spend billions of dol-
lars on a wall, I will spend $100 on a
ladder that will take care of that wall.
This is why we have to make sure that
we spend money on Border Patrol. We
are 2,000 Border Patrol agents short. In
fact, if we spend money on retention so
we can keep them, we don’t have to
lose them. We are losing Border Patrol
agents right now.
But we can’t spend it the wrong way.
The administration just spent $14.8
million to hire two Border Patrol
agents. Now, maybe one of them is
Captain America, I don’t know. But are
we going to spend $15 million to hire
two Border Patrol agents?
Spend that money on bonuses. Give
them the equipment that we have. Pro-
tect private property rights on the bor-
der. We can go ahead and do that.
If you want to stop drugs, look at the
latest DEA report. You will see that
the latest DEA report tells you that
drugs come in through ports of entry.
You can build the most beautiful wall,
and they are going to come in through
a port of entry. Put money on the ports
of entry. Put money on CBP facilities
and the facilities that we need.
Finally, the last thing I want to say
is this: There is technology that works
for the military, and if it works for the
military, we can surely use it on the
border. Personnel, technology, we have
to look at the right way of securing the
border.
I want to work with you. We want to
work with you, but the wall is a 14th
century solution. We can do better
than that.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. RICE).
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, it is true that about 30 per-
cent of the government is shut down.
We are in a standoff here. Why is that?
What is the purpose of this?
It is because of two scourges on our
country that have been brought on by
our poor southern border, and that is
illegal immigration and opioid deaths.
My constituents have had enough.
House Republicans passed a spending
bill just a few weeks ago that included
$5.7 billion that would go a long way
toward securing our southern border
and easing these disasters.
Now the Democrats take charge, and
the first thing they do is introduce a
bill that eliminates that spending for
border security.
With respect to illegal immigration,
hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens
cross our southern border every year.
This limitless supply of cheap labor un-
fairly competes for jobs and holds down
wages for hardworking, law-abiding
Americans. The most affected are the
most vulnerable at the bottom of the
income ladder.
The American middle class is smaller
and today makes the same money as it
did in 1990. That is right. Until Donald
Trump came along, the American mid-
dle class hadn’t had a raise in 25 years.
Cheap labor from illegal aliens break-
ing our laws every year to cheat Amer-
ican workers is one of the primary
causes.
Madam Speaker, my friends on the
other side of the aisle love to complain
about income inequality. Well, here is
a chance to stop complaining and actu-
ally do something about income in-
equality.
If you truly want to give the middle
class a raise, let’s stop the endless flow
of illegal labor that cheats our middle
class. Let’s restore the $5.7 billion to
secure our southern border and stop
the flow of cheap illegal labor and
watch wages rise.
With respect to opioids, the scourge
of opioid death is not new, but it is ex-
ploding in America as gangs and drug
cartels become more adept at exploit-
ing our porous southern border for fan-
tastic profits. But these criminal prof-
its come at great cost for honest, hard-
working people, both in Central and
South America and here in the United
States.
In 2017, 70,000 people died from opioid
overdoses. That is up 45 percent in 1
year. One hundred thirty-two of these
Americans killed by drugs were in my
district, and they are in your districts,
too.
You want to argue about who caused
the shutdown? I don’t care about who
caused the shutdown. What I care
about are 70,000 Americans killed by
opioids, most of which come across our
southern border. Law enforcement tells
me 85 percent of those drugs killing my
constituents and yours come across our
southern border.
b 2045
That 70,000 Americans killed by drug
overdoses is more than traffic deaths,
37,000, and homicides, 17,000, combined;
more than traffic deaths and homicides
combined. And most of these drugs
killing your constituents are coming
across our southern border.
Mr. Speaker, the Democrats say they
are for border security, but they take
no action. Empty words.
They stripped the funding from the
spending bill. They want to argue
about who is to blame for the shut-
down. Go home and tell that to a fam-
ily that lost a loved one from opioids
because you refused to take action to
secure our southern border. Empty
words.
Funny, Mr. SCHUMER voted in favor
of a border wall in 2006. Why is he
against it now? Because Mr. Trump
wants it? Empty words.
It is time to stop the finger pointing
and do something to truly help our
constituents. Let’s help the middle
class by ending unfair competition
from illegal aliens.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentleman.
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, let’s reduce opioid deaths by
ending the flow of deadly drugs from
Mexico. Let’s restore the $5.7 billion
that Homeland Security says they need
to finally secure our southern border.
Madam Speaker, the Democrats are
terribly worried about who gets blamed
for the shutdown. Frankly, I don’t care
who gets blamed.
This is a fight to keep drugs off our
streets and out of the hands of our chil-
dren. It is a fight to keep our commu-
nities safe. It is a fight for higher
wages for hardworking Americans. It is
a fight worth having.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. RUPPERS-
BERGER), another longtime member of
the Appropriations Subcommittee on
Homeland Security.
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam
Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 1,
which makes continuing appropria-
tions for the Department of Homeland
Security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H194 January 3, 2019
As a matter of principle, I don’t like
continuing resolutions. Stop-gap bills
provide funding at current levels only;
they prevent new spending where need-
ed and prolong programs that have
been discontinued; and last, Band-Aid
budgets are bad for everyone, the
American taxpayers and especially
those on the front lines tasked with
protecting the homeland.
But today, the 13th day of this sense-
less government shutdown, the admin-
istration has tied our hands in demand-
ing more than $5 billion for the Presi-
dent’s campaign pledge, a border wall
that really does not work.
I am a member of the Appropriations
Homeland Security Subcommittee.
When we met with the previous head of
the border patrol, Ronald Vitiello, we
asked: How much time does a physical
wall buy you?
His answer was: ‘‘ . . . a few minutes
to a few seconds.’’
What we need is more manpower.
Last year there were more than 800 va-
cancies for border patrol officers at
checkpoints in Laredo, Tucson, and
San Diego alone. They are working tri-
ple overtime there.
So our tax dollars can be better spent
investing in more Customs and Border
Patrol officers, more immigration
judges, and by leveraging the fruits of
modern technology, such as new com-
munication towers, state-of-the-art
cameras, drones, all-terrain vehicles,
and fencing where appropriate.
Brick and mortar walls are a 4th cen-
tury solution to a 21st century prob-
lem.
We also need President Trump to
stop leading by fear and falsehoods.
As it relates to his border wall issue,
the real problem is undocumented im-
migrants overstaying their visas,
which constitutes well over half of
those here illegally. And those are
facts.
Most of the drugs entering our coun-
try are coming through official land,
air, and seaports of entry. I represent
one of those ports: the Port of Balti-
more.
In electing 60 new Democrats to Con-
gress, the American people have re-
jected this willy-nilly style of govern-
ance and are demanding a return to
commonsense governing.
No, we don’t want open borders. Yes,
we can do better when it comes to bor-
der security, but we must do it strate-
gically.
This continuing resolution gives us
30 days to debate funding levels for bor-
der security, including physical en-
hancements. It is identical to legisla-
tion already passed by our colleagues
in the Senate just a few weeks ago.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.J. Res. 1.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
Democrats made a pledge to the Amer-
ican people, and we are here at 8:50 in
the evening making good on our pledge
to the American people to open the
government, to open the government
by funding certain appropriations up
until September 30, and by opening the
government by extending Homeland
Security funding until February 8 to
make sure that the TSOs, the border
patrol, the CBPs are all being paid.
How many of you go through the air-
ports and go through security? Do you
realize that those TSOs are not being
paid?
My commitment to them as I trav-
eled here to Washington is: You need to
be paid; not because you are not great
public servants, but because it is a
shame.
So I come today to say, do what is
right, not for the party, but for the
American people.
The President indicated: I will build
a great, great wall on our southern bor-
der and Mexico will pay for it.
Where is the Mexico funding? Today I
introduced a bill: no funding for the
wall; Mexico will pay for it.
So it is extremely important to rec-
ognize our duty, and our duty is to
fund this government, but I also want
to give a constitutional lesson, if I
might.
Article I is the Congress. Article II is
the executive. We work together. We
don’t have dictates from the executive
to tell Congress what is best to do for
the American people.
Pay our Federal workers so that jobs
can get done, so that there is not rub-
bish and trash and disaster on the Mall
that is so beautiful.
And what is this breaking news?
Again, the misuse of the military. The
Trump administration wants to send
more troops to the border, not for pro-
tecting the border with Mexico, but to
add 160 miles of wire.
I just came from the border on Satur-
day. I wanted to say what I know. I go
to the border all the time through the
years that I have been on Homeland
Security and I talk to the border patrol
agents, and they don’t want a concrete
wall, but I will tell you what they
need——
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentlewoman from Texas.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
they don’t want a four-legged table
with Pepto Bismol on the table and one
doctor. They don’t want a room of indi-
viduals who have a sign that says, ‘‘Flu
room.’’ They don’t want the innocent
children and families coming across,
who are now condemned that they are
coming across misrepresenting, and
they are fleeing bloodshed and persecu-
tion. And the dominant numbers who
are coming across the border are
women and children and families.
We are a big enough Nation to have a
resolution through real border secu-
rity, through technology, through per-
sonnel, through individuals at the
ports of entry, CBP.
We know how to do this, and all we
need to do is sit down and do it. That
is why we need the bills that are on the
floor, Madam Speaker. Open the gov-
ernment now and vote for these bills.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on
this bill. I yield back the balance of my
time.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to
support this resolution and the critical
work of the Department of Homeland
Security. I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 5, the
previous question is ordered on the
joint resolution.
The question is on the engrossment
and third reading of the joint resolu-
tion.
The joint resolution was ordered to
be engrossed and read a third time, and
was read the third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
have a motion to recommit at the
desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentlewoman opposed to the joint reso-
lution?
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I
am, in its current form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Ms. Granger moves to recommit the joint
resolution H.J. Res. 1 to the Committee on
Appropriations.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas is recognized for
5 minutes.
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, the
bills that House Democrats have cho-
sen to consider today are not in keep-
ing with the months of good-faith ne-
gotiations to resolve the differences be-
tween the House, the Senate, and the
White House.
More importantly, they fail to truly
address the crisis on our southern bor-
der and the very real threat it poses to
the safety and security of our home-
land.
We owe it to the American people to
work together to address this problem
and secure our border. It is time to re-
open the government and fund border
security.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the motion to
recommit, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the mo-
tion to recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, this shutdown has gone on
long enough. This motion to recommit
would only further prolong the shut-
down.
We need to pass H.J. Res. 1 imme-
diately to ensure that all components

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H199
January 3, 2019
Sixth, decorum in debate;
Seventh, conduct of votes by elec-
tronic device;
Eighth, use of handouts on the House
floor;
Ninth, use of electronic equipment on
the House floor; and
Tenth, use of the Chamber.
These announcements, where appro-
priate, will reiterate the origins of the
stated policies. The Chair intends to
continue in the 116th Congress the poli-
cies reflected in these statements.
The policy announced in the 102nd
Congress with respect to jurisdictional
concepts related to clauses 5(a) of rule
XXI—tax and tariff measures—will
continue to govern but need not be re-
iterated, as it is adequately docu-
mented as precedent in the House
Rules and Manual.
Without objection, the announce-
ments will be printed in the RECORD.
There was no objection.
1. Privileges of the Floor
The Chair will make the following an-
nouncements regarding floor privileges,
which will apply during the 116th Congress.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT
TO STAFF
Rule IV strictly limits those persons to
whom the privileges of the floor during ses-
sions of the House are extended, and that
rule prohibits the Chair from entertaining
requests for suspension or waiver of that
rule. As reiterated by the Chair on January
21, 1986, January 3, 1985, January 25, 1983, and
August 22, 1974, and as stated in Chapter 10,
section 2, of House Practice, the rule strictly
limits the number of committee staff on the
floor at one time during the consideration of
measures reported from their committees.
This permission does not extend to Members’
personal staff except when a Member’s
amendment is actually pending during the
five-minute rule. It also does not extend to
personal staff of Members who are sponsors
of pending bills. The Chair requests the co-
operation of all Members and committee
staff to assure that only the proper number
of staff are on the floor, and then only dur-
ing the consideration of measures within the
jurisdiction of their committees. The Chair
is making this statement and reiterating
this policy because of Members’ past insist-
ence upon strict enforcement of the rule. The
Chair requests each committee chair, and
each ranking minority member, to submit to
the Speaker a list of those staff who are al-
lowed on the floor during the consideration
of a measure in the jurisdiction of their com-
mittee. The Sergeant-at-Arms, who has been
directed to assure proper enforcement of rule
IV, will keep the list. Each staff person
should exchange his or her ID for a ‘‘com-
mittee staff’ badge, which is to be worn
while on the floor. The Chair has consulted,
and will continue to consult with, the Minor-
ity Leader.
Furthermore, as the Chair announced on
January 7, 2003, in accordance with the
change in the 108th Congress of clause 2(a) of
rule IV regarding leadership staff floor ac-
cess, only designated staff approved by the
Speaker shall be granted the privilege of the
floor. The Speaker intends that this approval
be narrowly granted on a bipartisan basis to
staff from the majority and minority side
and only to those staff essential to floor ac-
tivities.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT
TO FORMER MEMBERS
The Speaker’s policy announced on Feb-
ruary 1, 2006, will continue to apply in the
116th Congress.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER, FEBRUARY 1,
2006
The SPEAKER. The House has adopted a
revision to the rule regarding the admission
to the floor and the rooms leading thereto.
Clause 4 of rule IV provides that a former
Member, Delegate or Resident Commissioner
or a former Parliamentarian of the House, or
a former elected officer of the House or a
former minority employee nominated as an
elected officer of the House shall not be enti-
tled to the privilege of admission to the Hall
of the House and the rooms extending there-
to if he or she is a registered lobbyist or an
agent of a foreign principal; has any direct
personal pecuniary interest in any legisla-
tive measure pending before the House, or re-
ported by a committee; or is in the employ of
or represents any party or organization for
the purpose of influencing, directly or indi-
rectly, the passage, defeat, or amendment of
any legislative proposal.
This restriction extends not only to the
House floor but adjacent rooms, the cloak-
rooms and the Speaker’s lobby.
Clause 4 of rule IV also allows the Speaker
to exempt ceremonial and educational func-
tions from the restrictions of this clause.
These restrictions shall not apply to attend-
ance at joint meetings or joint sessions,
Former Members’ Day proceedings, edu-
cational tours, and other occasions as the
Speaker may designate.
Members who have reason to know that a
person is on the floor inconsistent with
clause 4 of rule IV should notify the Ser-
geant-at-Arms promptly.
2. Introduction of Bills and Resolutions
The policy that the Chair announced on
January 3, 1983, with respect to the introduc-
tion and reference of bills and resolutions
will continue to apply in the 116th Congress.
The Chair has advised all officers and em-
ployees of the House who are involved in the
processing of bills that every bill, resolution,
memorial, petition or other material that is
placed in the hopper must bear the signature
of a Member. Where a bill or resolution is
jointly sponsored, the signature must be
that of the Member first named thereon. The
bill clerk is instructed to return to the Mem-
ber any bill which appears in the hopper
without an original signature. This proce-
dure was inaugurated in the 92d Congress. It
has worked well, and the Chair thinks that it
is essential to continue this practice to in-
sure the integrity of the process by which
legislation is introduced in the House.
The Chair has noted a need for increased
attention to detail regarding the addition of
cosponsors to measures to ensure accuracy.
To that end, Members are encouraged to use
the template provided by the Office of the
Clerk, which requests Members seeking to be
added as cosponors to include their printed
name, original signature, and state. Mem-
bers routinely include their original signa-
tures, states, and districts when voting by
card in the well, so the Chair is hopeful that
the inclusion of such information on a co-
sponsor form will be a familiar task.
3. Unanimous-Consent Requests for the Consid-
eration of Legislation
The policy the Chair announced on Janu-
ary 6, 1999, with respect to recognition for
unanimous-consent requests for the consid-
eration of certain legislative measures will
continue to apply in the 116th Congress. The
Speaker will continue to follow the guide-
lines recorded in section 956 of the House
Rules and Manual conferring recognition for
unanimous-consent requests for the consid-
eration of bills, resolutions, and other meas-
ures only when assured that the majority
and minority floor leadership and the rel-
evant committee chairs and ranking minor-
ity members have no objection. Consistent
with those guidelines and with the Chair’s
inherent power of recognition under clause 2
of rule XVII, the Chair, and any occupant of
the chair appointed as Speaker pro tempore
pursuant to clause 8 of rule I, will decline
recognition for the unanimous-consent re-
quests chronicled in section 956 without as-
surances that the request has been so
cleared. This denial of recognition by the
Chair will not reflect necessarily any per-
sonal opposition on the part of the Chair to
orderly consideration of the matter in ques-
tion, but will reflect the determination upon
the part of the Chair that orderly procedures
will be followed; that is, procedures involv-
ing consultation and agreement between
floor and committee leadership on both sides
of the aisle.
4. Recognition for One-Minute Speeches
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT
TO ONE-MINUTE SPEECHES
The Speaker’s policy announced on August
8, 1984, with respect to recognition for one-
minute speeches will apply during the 116th
Congress. The Chair will alternate recogni-
tion for one-minute speeches between major-
ity and minority Members, in the order in
which they seek recognition in the well
under present practice from the Chair’s right
to the Chair’s left, with possible exceptions
for Members of the leadership and Members
having business requests. The Chair, of
course, reserves the right to limit one-
minute speeches to a certain period of time
or to a special place in the program on any
given day, with notice to the leadership.
In addition, during the 116th Congress, the
Chair will continue the practice of not recog-
nizing Members for a one-minute speech
more than one time per legislative day.
5. Recognition for Special-Order Speeches
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT
TO SPECIAL-ORDER SPEECHES
The Speaker’s policy with regard to spe-
cial-order speeches announced on February
11, 1994, as clarified and reiterated by subse-
quent Speakers, will continue to apply in the
116th Congress, with the following modifica-
tions.
The Chair may recognize Members for spe-
cial-order speeches for up to 4 hours. Such
speeches may not extend beyond the 4-hour
limit without the permission of the Chair,
which may be granted only with advance
consultation between the leaderships and no-
tification to the House. However, the Chair
will not recognize for any special-order
speeches beyond 10 o’clock in the evening.
The 4-hour limitation will be divided be-
tween the majority and minority parties.
Each party is entitled to reserve its first
hour for respective leaderships or their des-
ignees. The second hour reserved to each
party will be divided into two 30-minute peri-
ods. Recognition for one-hour periods and for
30-minute periods will alternate initially and
subsequently between the parties each day.
The Chair wishes to clarify for Members that
any 60- or 30-minute period that is not
claimed at the appropriate time will be con-
sidered to have expired; this includes the
first 60-minute period of the day.
The allocation of time within each party’s
2-hour period (or shorter period if prorated
to end by 10 p.m.) will be determined by a
list submitted to the Chair by the respective
leaderships. Members may not sign up with
their leadership for any special-order speech-
es earlier than one week prior to the special
order. The Chair will not recognize a Member
for more than one special-order speech per
week, nor may a Member sign up for a sec-
ond special-order speech in the same week.
Additional guidelines may be established for
such sign-ups by the respective leaderships.

HOUSE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H200 January 3, 2019
Pursuant to clause 2(a) of rule V, the tele-
vision cameras will not pan the Chamber,
but a ‘‘crawl’’ indicating the conduct of
morning-hour debate or that the House has
completed its legislative business and is pro-
ceeding with special-order speeches will ap-
pear on the screen. The Chair may announce
other adaptations during this period.
The continuation of this format for rec-
ognition by the Speaker is without prejudice
to the Speaker’s ultimate power of recogni-
tion under clause 2 of rule XVII and includes
the ability to withdraw recognition for
longer special-order speeches should cir-
cumstances warrant.
6. Decorum in Debate
Although clause 5 of rule XVII prohibits
Members from wearing hats on the floor of
the House, the Speaker intends to continue
to apply discretion in enforcing this prohibi-
tion in the case of hats or other head cov-
erings worn for reasons of medical necessity.
In addition, the Chair’s announced policies
of January 7, 2003, January 4, 1995, and Janu-
ary 3, 1991, will apply in the 116th Congress.
It is essential that the dignity of the pro-
ceedings of the House be preserved, not only
to assure that the House conducts its busi-
ness in an orderly fashion but also to permit
Members to properly comprehend and par-
ticipate in the business of the House. To this
end, and in order to permit the Chair to un-
derstand and to correctly put the question
on the numerous requests that are made by
Members, the Chair requests that Members
and others who have the privileges of the
floor desist from audible conversation in the
Chamber while the business of the House is
being conducted. The Chair would encourage
all Members to review rule XVII to gain a
better understanding of the proper rules of
decorum expected of them, and especially: to
avoid ‘‘personalities’’ in debate with respect
to references to other Members, the Senate,
and the President; to address the Chair only
during, and not beyond, the time recognized,
and not to address the television or other
imagined audience; to refrain from passing
between the Chair and a Member speaking,
or directly in front of a Member speaking
from the well; to refrain from smoking in the
Chamber; to wear appropriate business attire
in the Chamber; and to generally display the
same degree of respect to the Chair and
other Members that every Member is due.
The Chair would like all Members to be on
notice that the Chair intends to strictly en-
force time limitations on debate. Further-
more, the Chair has the authority to imme-
diately interrupt Members in debate who
transgress rule XVII by failing to avoid ‘‘per-
sonalities’’ in debate with respect to ref-
erences to the Senate, the President, and
other Members, rather than wait for Mem-
bers to complete their remarks.
Finally, it is not in order to speak dis-
respectfully of the Speaker; and under the
precedents the sanctions for such violations
transcend the ordinary requirements for
timeliness of challenges. This separate treat-
ment is recorded in volume 2 of Hinds’ Prece-
dents, at section 1248 and was reiterated on
January 19, 1995.
7. Conduct of Votes by Electronic Device
The Speaker’s policy announced on Janu-
ary 4, 1995, with respect to the conduct of
electronic votes will continue in the 116th
Congress with modifications as follows.
As Members are aware, clause 2(a) of rule
XX provides that Members shall have not
less than 15 minutes in which to answer an
ordinary record vote or quorum call.
The rule obviously establishes 15 minutes
as a minimum. Still, with the cooperation of
the Members, a vote can easily be completed
in that time. The events of October 30, 1991,
stand out as proof of this point. On that oc-
casion, the House was considering a bill in
the Committee of the Whole under a special
rule that placed an overall time limit on the
amendment process, including the time con-
sumed by record votes. The Chair announced,
and then strictly enforced, a policy of clos-
ing electronic votes as soon as possible after
the guaranteed period of 15 minutes. Mem-
bers appreciated and cooperated with the
Chair’s enforcement of the policy on that oc-
casion.
The Chair desires that the example of Oc-
tober 30, 1991, be made the regular practice of
the House. To that end, the Chair enlists the
assistance of all Members in avoiding the un-
necessary loss of time in conducting the
business of the House. The Chair encourages
all Members to depart for the Chamber
promptly upon the appropriate bell and light
signal. As in recent Congresses, the cloak-
rooms should not forward to the Chair re-
quests to hold a vote by electronic device,
but should simply apprise inquiring Members
of the time remaining on the voting clock.
Members should not rely on signals relayed
from outside the Chamber to assume that
votes will be held open until they arrive in
the Chamber. Members will be given a rea-
sonable amount of time in which to accu-
rately record their votes, and the Chair will
endeavor to assess the presence of the mem-
bership and the expectation of further votes
prior to exercising the authority under
clause 9 of rule XX or clause 6(g) of rule
XVIII. The Speaker believes the best prac-
tice for presiding officers is to await the
Clerk’s certification that a vote tally is com-
plete and accurate. Members are further re-
minded, in accordance with the Speaker’s
statement of January 7, 2016, that the stand-
ard policy is to not terminate the vote when
a Member is in the well attempting to cast a
vote. Other efforts to hold the vote open are
not similarly protected.
8. Use of Handouts on House Floor
The Speaker’s policy announced on Sep-
tember 27, 1995, which was prompted by a
misuse of handouts on the House floor and
made at the bipartisan request of the Com-
mittee on Standards of Official Conduct, will
continue in the 116th Congress. All handouts
distributed on or adjacent to the House floor
by Members during House proceedings must
bear the name of the Member authorizing
their distribution. In addition, the content of
those materials must comport with stand-
ards of propriety applicable to words spoken
in debate or inserted in the Record. Failure
to comply with this admonition may con-
stitute a breach of decorum and may give
rise to a question of privilege.
The Chair would also remind Members
that, pursuant to clause 5 of rule IV, staff is
prohibited from engaging in efforts in the
Hall of the House or rooms leading thereto
to influence Members with regard to the leg-
islation being amended. Staff cannot dis-
tribute handouts.
In order to enhance the quality of debate
in the House, the Chair would ask Members
to minimize the use of handouts.
9. Use of Electronic Equipment on House Floor
The Speaker’s policy announced on Janu-
ary 27, 2000, as clarified on January 6, 2009,
and as modified by the change in clause 5 of
rule XVII in the 112th Congress, will con-
tinue in the 116th Congress with modifica-
tions as follows. All Members and staff are
reminded of the absolute prohibition con-
tained in clause 5 of rule XVII against the
use of mobile electronic devices that impair
decorum. Those devices include wireless tele-
phones and personal computers. The Chair
wishes to note that electronic tablet devices
do not constitute personal computers within
the meaning of this policy and thus may be
unobtrusively used in the Chamber. No de-
vice may be used for still photography or for
audio or video recording or for live broad-
casting.
The Chair requests all Members and staff
wishing to receive or make wireless tele-
phone calls to do so outside of the Chamber.
The Chair further requests that all Members
and staff refrain from wearing telephone
headsets in the Chamber and to deactivate
any audible ring of wireless phones before
entering the Chamber. To this end, the Chair
insists upon the cooperation of all Members
and staff and instructs the Sergeant-at-
Arms, pursuant to clause 3(a) of rule II and
clause 5 of rule XVII, to enforce this prohibi-
tion.
In light of the changes to rule II and rule
XVII in the 115th Congress, the Chair would
like to take this opportunity to educate all
Members and staff on how these changes will
be implemented. The Sergeant-at-Arms is
charged with enforcement of clause 3(g) rule
II, which prohibits the use of electronic de-
vices for still photography or for audio or
visual recording or broadcasting in con-
travention of clause 5 of rule XVII and the
policies just articulated. The Chair would
advise Members of the following policies of
the Sergeant-at-Arms surrounding the rules
change.
The Sergeant-at-Arms will enforce the pro-
hibition with respect to violations observed
first-hand on the House floor as well as vio-
lations that become apparent at a later time,
such as through publication online or broad-
cast on television.
In the case of violations observed on the
floor, the Sergeant-at-Arms will hand the of-
fending Member a card noting the violation,
and will follow up by sending the Member a
written letter. In the case of other viola-
tions, Members will receive a written letter
detailing the offending conduct.
The fine for a first offense is $500. The fine
for each subsequent offense is $2500. The Ser-
geant-at-Arms will endeavor to provide
Members a written warning prior to assess-
ing a fine for a first offense. Because of the
inherent difficulty of enforcing this prohibi-
tion during ceremonial events, the Sergeant-
at-Arms may choose not to cite minor viola-
tions occurring during such an event.
Pursuant to clause 3(g)(3) of rule II, in ad-
dition to notifying the Member, Delegate, or
Resident Commissioner concerned, the Ser-
geant-at-Arms will also notify the Speaker,
the Chief Administrative Officer, and the
Committee on Ethics of any fine imposed.
Upon receiving notification of a fine, a Mem-
ber, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner
may appeal the fine to the Committee on
Ethics within 30 calendar days or 5 legisla-
tive days, whichever is later.
The Sergeant-at-Arms and the Committee
on Ethics are each authorized to establish
policies and procedures for the implementa-
tion of these rules. The Chief Administrative
Officer is authorized to establish policies and
procedures for deducting any such fine from
a Member’s net salary. It is the desire of the
Chair that any such policies and procedures
be submitted for printing in the Congres-
sional Record.
Nothing in the House rules or this policy
deprives the House of its ability to address
breaches of decorum or other violations of
House rules that may give rise to questions
of the privileges of the House under rule IX.
The Chair appreciates the attention of all
Members to these efforts.
10. Use of Chamber
The Speaker’s policy announced on Janu-
ary 6, 2009, with respect to use of the Cham-
ber will continue in the 116th Congress.
The Chair will announce to the House the
policy of the Speaker concerning appropriate
comportment in the chamber when the
House is not in session.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H201
January 3, 2019
Under clause 3 of rule I, the Speaker is re-
sponsible to control the Hall of the House.
Under clause 1 of rule IV, the Hall of the
House is to be used only for the legislative
business of the House, for caucus and con-
ference meetings of its Members, and for
such ceremonies as the House might agree to
conduct there.
When the House stands adjourned, its
chamber remains on static display. It may
accommodate visitors in the gallery or on
the floor, subject to the needs of those who
operate, maintain, and secure the chamber
to go about their ordinary business. Because
outside ‘‘coverage’’ of the chamber is limited
to floor proceedings and is allowed only by
accredited journalists, when the chamber is
on static display no audio or video recording
or transmitting devices are allowed. The
long custom of disallowing even still photog-
raphy in the chamber is based at least in
part on the notion that an image having this
setting as its backdrop might be taken to
carry the imprimatur of the House.
The imprimatur of the House adheres to
the Journal of its proceedings, which is kept
pursuant to the Constitution. The impri-
matur of the House adheres to the Congres-
sional Record, which is kept as a substan-
tially verbatim transcript pursuant to clause
8 of rule XVII. The imprimatur of the House
adheres to the audio and visual trans-
missions and recordings that are made and
kept by the television system administered
by the Speaker pursuant to rule V. But the
imprimatur of the House may not be appro-
priated to other, ad hoc accounts or composi-
tions of events in its chamber.

NEW MEMBERS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as
we begin the 116th Congress, I am glad
to be welcoming back my friends and
returning colleagues to what I hope
will be a productive session. Before we
get to work, I would like to note the
arrival of eight new Members who were
just sworn in.
The Senate welcomes MARSHA BLACK-
BURN of Tennessee, MIKE BRAUN of Indi-
ana, KEVIN CRAMER of North Dakota,
JOSH HAWLEY of Missouri, MARTHA
MCSALLY of Arizona, MITT ROMNEY of
Utah, JACKY ROSEN of Nevada, and
KYRSTEN SINEMA of Arizona, and in the
coming days, Rick Scott of Florida will
join our ranks.
I would like to welcome each of our
incoming colleagues—as well as their
families—to the Senate. Today you are
forming the newest links in a historic
chain and continuing the rich tradi-
tions of this body in which we are so
fortunate to serve.
On a related note, I am pleased our
new colleagues and the entire Senate
will continue learning from the exam-
ple of one of the most loyal stewards of
our traditions, Senator CHUCK GRASS-
LEY, who has been elected today as our
new President pro tempore.
So congratulations to the senior Sen-
ator from Iowa on this tremendous ac-
complishment.
f
THE NEW CONGRESS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as
we begin this new Congress together,
one fact is abundantly clear—the
American people need Democrats and
Republicans to work together.
Today illustrates that very point.
Last November, voters expanded our
Republican majority in the Senate but
ensured that 60 votes will only be at-
tainable by working across the aisle,
and incoming Speaker PELOSI will be
leading a new Democratic majority
over in the House.
This is the landscape in which we
will be operating. Fortunately, the
record of the 115th Congress illustrates
just how much is possible when both
sides make bipartisan collaboration a
priority.
In the Senate, our good-faith efforts
yielded a historic tally of legislative

S8 January 3, 2019
accomplishments on behalf of the
American people. We passed landmark
legislation to help heal the wounds of
the opioid epidemic. We delivered
measures to help lower prescription
drug prices and expand access to safe
treatments. We reached a major agree-
ment to rebuild America’s military and
designed VA reforms that will help our
Nation better keep its solemn promises
to the brave men and women who have
served. We brought a bipartisan scalpel
to financial regulations so fewer of
Main Street’s local lenders will get
trapped in the maze of Wall Street’s
rule book. We reasserted a commit-
ment to regular order appropriations.
We laid the groundwork for rebuilding
American infrastructure. We delivered
certainty and predictability to farming
communities across our country.
So we know the Senate, with this Re-
publican majority, is fertile soil for big
bipartisan accomplishments. The ques-
tion is, Will the newly Democratic
House join in this good momentum or
bring it to a standstill? It is a clear
choice, and it will be clear to the
American people watching all this at
home: Good governance or political
performance art? The public interest or
political spite? Policymaking or Presi-
dential harassment?
The first test is already upon us. Just
yesterday, I was glad to join House and
Senate leaders of both parties in a
meeting with President Trump at the
White House to discuss border security
and outstanding appropriations.
This meeting included a briefing on
the urgent crisis at our southern bor-
der. The facts on the ground are truly
striking.
As the Border Patrol Chief testified
before the Judiciary Committee a few
weeks ago, the Border Patrol appre-
hended more than 800—800—gang mem-
bers just last year, a 50-percent in-
crease over the previous year. Meth-
amphetamine seizures are up 75 percent
since fiscal year 2015.
Importantly, we also know that in
each of our four CBP sectors where
physical barriers have been improved
or expanded, illegal traffic has dropped
by at least—now listen to this—90 per-
cent in these areas where there are
physical barriers, illegal traffic has
dropped by 90 percent.
These are the facts on which the en-
tire conversation must turn. Yet, as
yesterday marked the 12th day of this
ongoing partial government shutdown,
our Democratic colleagues seemed less
concerned with these facts than with
their unreasonable political standoff
with President Trump.
So for the benefit of all involved, let
me restate the terms of engagement; in
other words, where we are. We need a
bicameral, bipartisan compromise solu-
tion. We need an arrangement that can
check these three boxes: pass the
House, achieve the support of at least
60 Senators, and get a Presidential sig-
nature. This is not complicated. That
is how you make a law.
The legislation that House Demo-
crats reportedly plan to vote on later
today is, in my view, not a serious at-
tempt to check all three of those boxes.
In fact, it ignores the bipartisan con-
ference negotiations and progress made
on these spending bills over the last
month. So I would call it political the-
ater, not productive lawmaking.
I have made it clear on several occa-
sions—and let me say it again—the
Senate will not take up any proposal
that does not have a real chance of
passing this Chamber and getting a
Presidential signature. So let’s not
waste the time. Let’s not get off on the
wrong foot with House Democrats
using their platform to produce polit-
ical statements rather than serious so-
lutions. Let’s pick up where we left off
and dedicate this 116th Congress to the
spirit of bipartisan collaboration to
create more victories for the American
people.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
YOUNG). The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
HOEVEN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

WELCOMING MEMBERS OF THE
SENATE
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first
allow me to welcome all of the new
Members who were just sworn in for
the first time as U.S. Senators, as well
as my friends who were reelected to
this body. We are entrusted with an
awesome responsibility to conduct the
vital business of this country we all
love. We come at it from many perspec-
tives, backgrounds, and geographies,
but the hope is that we can come to-
gether and get some good things done.
I hope, in this new year and through-
out the new Congress, the Senate will
prove worthy of the responsibility and
faithfully discharge our duties to our
States, our country, the Constitution,
and, of course, the well-being of the
American people.
Now, sadly, as I address you, this new
Congress is under the shadow of a gov-
ernment shutdown. Only one person is
to blame for this predicament—Presi-
dent Trump. Democrats made several
offers to the President that would have
kept the government open over the hol-
iday break. We even agreed to Leader
MCCONNELL’s proposal to pass a clean
continuing resolution to avoid a shut-
down, and it passed the Senate unani-
mously; every single Democrat and
every single Republican was for it. All
indications were that President Trump
would sign it, but then, hounded by the
far right, particularly the radio and TV
commentators, President Trump threw
a temper tantrum at the eleventh hour,
and demanded more than $5 billion for
an ineffective border wall, knowing full
well that it lacked the votes in the
Senate.
After publicly rooting for a govern-
ment shutdown for months, President
Trump finally got his wish. Now, nine
Cabinet Departments and dozens of
other Agencies are shut down and hun-
dreds of thousands of Federal workers
are doing their jobs without pay. Food
safety inspectors are running out of re-
sources. Federal courts are running out
of money. National Parks are suffering.
In a few short months, the IRS will not
be able to issue tax refunds that are
vital to so many families.
Yesterday, the President invited con-
gressional leaders to the White House.
Speaker-designate PELOSI and I sought
to have a sensible discussion about how
to reopen the government. We proposed
two bills that separate the wall fight
from the government shutdown. Let
me repeat that. The two bills we pro-
posed separate the wall fight from the
government shutdown. You don’t have
to have one, even if you can’t resolve
the other.
We proposed two bills: first, a six-bill
minibus to provide appropriations for
every Cabinet Department except
Homeland Security and, second, a 30-
day continuing resolution for Home-
land Security.
The six bills are not Democratic
bills, as I heard some of the rightwing
commentators say. The six bills are the
same bills that Republicans, including
Leader MCCONNELL, supported in the
Senate Appropriations Committee. The
CR passed unanimously through the
Senate last year. Four of the six bills
came to the floor and passed the Sen-
ate 92 to 6, with the vast majority of
Democrats and Republicans being for
them.
These are not Democratic bills. They
were crafted in a bipartisan way by a
Republican-controlled Senate Appro-
priations Committee and a Republican-
controlled Senate. If these bills pass,
they would allow us to continue discus-
sion on border security without leaving
large portions of the government shut
down.
We obviously disagree about the best
way to secure the border. We believe
the wall is wrong on many counts. The
wall is ineffective—most experts agree
with that—and the wall is expensive.
When the wall was promised by
President Trump, he said it was a cam-
paign pledge he must keep. That was
not his campaign pledge. His campaign
pledge was to build a wall and have
Mexico pay for it, not American tax-
payers. So it is not a campaign pledge.
The President has no plan to deal
with eminent domain. There are hun-
dreds of landowners on the southern
border who will go to court and fight
every attempt by the Federal Govern-
ment to expropriate their land. That
will take years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S9
January 3, 2019
By the way, the Trump administra-
tion has not even spent the border se-
curity funding allocated by Congress
last year.
The wall is wrong. It is ineffective; it
is expensive; Mexico will not pay for it;
there is no plan to deal with eminent
domain; and they haven’t even spent
the border security funding allocated
last year.
One more point for so many Ameri-
cans: We do not want the wall to be a
symbol of America. We much prefer the
Statue of Liberty be that symbol. The
symbolism is bad for the country, for
our economy, for our security, and for
our ability to get along in the world.
Democrats certainly support strong,
effective border security: fencing,
drones, technology, roads, what the ex-
perts say will actually work—not a
wall. We totally disagree on that. But
even with that disagreement, I repeat,
there is no reason to keep unrelated
parts of the government shut down be-
cause of those disagreements.
If Leader MCCONNELL, tonight, would
put the bill that is passing the House
on the floor, it would pass. After all, it
was crafted by Republicans, especially
those on the Appropriations Com-
mittee. So they are not opposed to it.
Yesterday at our meeting, I asked
the President on multiple occasions to
give me one good reason he should keep
large portions of the government shut
down while we have a separate debate
about the border. He couldn’t name
one. He kept coming back and talking
about the border. I said: No, Mr. Presi-
dent, these six bills have nothing to do
with the border. Why can’t we pass
them? Why must we hold millions of
Americans who depend on the services
of these Agencies that are closed—hun-
dreds of thousands of workers who get
paid by these Agencies—why must we
hold them hostage? Why must a temper
tantrum determine how we vote and
what happens in this government? Ev-
eryone can shut down the government
on anything—any leader, any Presi-
dent. It is not the way to do things.
The President couldn’t name a single
reason that made any sense about why
he should keep the other Agencies
closed—not Homeland Security, but
the others, and that is the best indica-
tion of why there is a shutdown. Presi-
dent Trump is holding the government
hostage over his wall, using the well-
being of millions of Americans as hos-
tage in a futile attempt to get what he
wants: a concrete border wall.
Where do we go from here? Well, we
have a new Congress and several new
Senators were just sworn in. The House
of Representatives, of course, will
change control, and Democrats will see
a healthy majority. The new House ma-
jority is poised tonight to pass the two
bills we offered the President. Leader
MCCONNELL ought to take it up here on
the floor of the Senate.
Let me be clear about a few points.
The six-bill minibus is completely si-
lent on the issue of border security. It
would solely fund the eight Cabinet De-
partments not named Homeland Secu-
rity at levels agreed to by both parties
and signed off on by the overwhelming
majority of Republicans on both the
Appropriations Committee and in the
Senate. There is absolutely nothing in
those six bills that my Republican
friends oppose. Let me repeat: There is
nothing in those six bills that Senate
Republicans oppose. All but six voted
for the four of them that came to the
floor, and every single Republican on
the Appropriations Committee, includ-
ing Leader MCCONNELL, voted for them
in the Appropriations Committee.
When Leader MCCONNELL calls this
some Democratic proposal, he is abso-
lutely wrong. Leader MCCONNELL voted
for it; Leader MCCONNELL supported it
on both the floor and in the Appropria-
tions Committee. It is not a Demo-
cratic proposal. In fact, the House
Democrats went out of their way to
pass a proposal that Republicans sup-
ported, and Senators GRAHAM, MORAN,
LANKFORD, and MURKOWSKI voted for
those bills as chair of their Appropria-
tions Committees. They put them to-
gether.
Even if there are disagreements
about border security, why not pass the
six noncontroversial bipartisan bills?
That is the question I would ask every
one of my Republican colleagues. That
is the question the American people
are asking every one of my Republican
colleagues. Above all, they are asking
that of President Trump. What is the
rationale for keeping eight Cabinet De-
partments shuttered for an unrelated
dispute over the wall? There is none.
We can continue to debate the best
way to secure our border. We have dis-
agreements on those, but let us reopen
these Cabinet Departments and ensure
hundreds of thousands of Federal work-
ers receive their paychecks and, even
more importantly, that these Depart-
ments get back to work for the Amer-
ican people.
As I mentioned, the House will also
pass a 30-day continuing resolution for
the Department of Homeland Security.
Again, there is nothing in that bill
that Senate Republicans don’t support.
The Senate passed it unanimously be-
fore Christmas break. The only thing
that has changed between now and
then is that we will have a House
Speaker who will pass this bill, as well,
and once the House passes these two
bills, Leader MCCONNELL should put
them on the floor where I believe they
will receive strong bipartisan majori-
ties. It is going to be very hard for a
lot of Republicans to vote no on the
same bills they supported just a few
months ago.
The leader says that he is waiting for
White House approval. Unfortunately,
the White House is all over the map.
We don’t know where the White House
stands on any of these things. Yester-
day, President Trump publicly rejected
an offer made to Democrats a week ago
by his own Vice President. There is no
telling where the President will come
down on any given day. Surely, Leader
MCCONNELL knows—after passing a CR
through this Chamber, thinking it had
the President’s support—that if we rely
on the President alone, we can be shut
down for a long time. At this point, we
need to take the lead here in Congress
in the hope that we can show President
Trump the sweet light of reason.
We have given our Republican col-
leagues a way out of the shutdown
based on Republican-approved pro-
posals. All Leader MCCONNELL needs to
do to reopen the government is to
bring to the floor the legislation that
he and nearly every other Republican
Senator already support.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COR-
NYN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to
talk about what is happening in Con-
gress. We are in the 13th day of the
Trump shutdown—13 days that 9 of 15
Federal Departments and dozens of
Agencies have shut their doors; 13 days
in which hundreds of thousands of
Americans have been furloughed or are
working without pay; 13 days that
Americans have been denied govern-
ment services on which they rely and
for which they pay taxes.
The President is holding Federal
Government funding hostage in an at-
tempt to force American taxpayers to
pay for an ineffective and expensive
wall on the southern border that he
promised over and over again Mexico
would pay for. Everybody knows that is
not true. Mexico will not pay for Presi-
dent Trump’s wall. Unfortunately, the
American people are paying the price
of the Trump shutdown, and, frankly,
he does not seem to care. Let me give
some examples.
Since the shutdown began, our na-
tional parks—the treasure of this coun-
try—have been left largely unsuper-
vised. The welcome centers are closed.
Park Rangers have been furloughed.
There are few emergency or law en-
forcement personnel left to police the
parks or rescue injured guests. That af-
fects visitor safety, it reduces public
access, and it threatens national and
cultural resources in national parks in
every part of our country. We are al-
ready receiving reports of damage to
sensitive lands and national treas-
ures—campgrounds littered with trash,
overflowing toilets, locked restrooms.
Even where parks remain open, camp-
grounds and other sites are beginning
to close because of the obvious health
and safety reasons.
Aside from government, businesses
and gateway communities surrounding

our parks—taxpaying businesses—are
also paying the price of lost sales, rent-
als, and empty storefronts, as families
cancel their plans to visit because the
shutdown drags on and on and on.
Because of the Trump shutdown, the
U.S. Forest Service has curtailed forest
thinning and fire-prevention projects.
Just think of that. Within months of
when the Nation was reeling from and
dealing with a record-setting fire sea-
son, we cannot do the things that
might prevent these devastating fires—
we cannot get in there and work on
them.
Just a few days ago, the Farm Serv-
ice Agency shut their doors. That is
the Agency that supports farmers and
rural communities across the country.
We came together—Republicans and
Democrats—and passed a 5-year farm
bill. I was proud to be one of the con-
ferees of that farm bill. I saw both par-
ties work together. We passed it. It is
a complex and important bill, but
farmers and ranchers need information
from that bill right now.
Every farmer and rancher will tell
you they are planning for the growing
season: What can they plant? What
should they buy? What should they do?
They don’t know how the laws will af-
fect their operations heading into the
planting season. Why? Because no one
is in the office or staffing the phones,
answering these questions or signing
up producers for new programs. There
is nobody there. Farmers will also not
be able to apply for much needed loans
that they count on to get started in the
year and pay back as a result of their
labor during the season.
Many farmers, like those in my home
State of Vermont, face financial hard-
ship due to the dramatic drop in com-
modity prices brought on by President
Trump’s tariffs. They need these loans
to help pay their bills, stay afloat
through the winter and prepare for the
spring planting. With banks not willing
to lend to them and not knowing what
is going to happen, many rely on the
U.S. Department of Agriculture as
their lender of last resort. But the
doors are closed, and there is nobody
home.
While the President loudly pro-
claimed he would provide assistance
through the Market Facilitation Pro-
gram to help farmers mitigate the fi-
nancial losses caused by his tariffs, as
of December 28, there is no one there to
process any new applications for these
payments. The bottom line? The Presi-
dent put the tariffs in, but now they
are told to fend for themselves because
the President is holding the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and its safety nets
hostage to secure funding for his bor-
der wall. The Department of Agri-
culture has nothing to do with Presi-
dent Trump’s border wall. It could not
fund it if they wanted to. Yet virtually
every farmer of every kind in this
country is going to be affected by it.
In addition to government services
that have ground to a halt, an esti-
mated 450,000 employees are working,
but they are working without pay.
That includes 41,000 Federal law en-
forcement and correctional officers at
the Department of Justice—ATF
agents, FBI, U.S. marshals, and DEA
agents. They are not getting paid, but
their mortgages still come due. The
tuition payments for their children’s
education comes due. If they have
healthcare costs, that comes due. They
are told: You show up for work. Maybe
we will get around to paying you and
maybe we will not.
Then, you have 380,000 Federal em-
ployees who also have children, fami-
lies and bills who have been fur-
loughed. They have no guarantee that
they will receive back payment when
they return to work. Let me give you
an idea of who some of these people
are. They are 96 percent of our employ-
ees at NASA. I suppose they can sit at
home and watch China land their sat-
ellite on the back side of the Moon.
Who else does it include? It includes
80 percent of the National Park Serv-
ice, 60 percent of the Department of
Commerce, and 33 percent of the Forest
Service. In addition, many Federal
contractors have discontinued their
services, which leaves thousands of em-
ployees without work and without a
paycheck.
This doesn’t affect the President, but
many of our dedicated Federal employ-
ees work every day to serve our coun-
try, and they live paycheck to pay-
check: custodial workers, cafeteria
workers, telephone operators, contract
specialists, customer service represent-
atives. These are the people the tax-
payers can call when they have a ques-
tion, and now they get no answer. They
are people who have mortgages to pay.
They have families to take care of.
This financial disruption comes on the
heels of the holiday season, when so
many families’ budgets are tight, it is
even harder to fathom. It is even hard-
er to justify. In fact, I will say it can-
not be justified.
Most of these Federal employees who
are without a paycheck have abso-
lutely nothing to do with border secu-
rity. That is the worst part about it.
They are not the ones involved with
border security, but they are casualties
of President Trump’s single-minded ob-
session of walling off our southern bor-
der. The President has repeatedly said:
This is all about are border security.
Really? Really? Come on. Give me a
break. His actions caused the very De-
partment in charge of securing our bor-
ders to be cut off from all the funding.
Eighty-eight percent of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security employees
are working without pay. They have to
think about how they are going to pay
their mortgage, their bills. They are
working without pay. That includes
54,000 Customs and Border Patrol
agents who protect our southern border
and our northern borders. Many of
them are veterans.
As of January 1, roughly 42,000 hard-
working, dedicated members of our Na-
tion’s Coast Guard will be protecting
our country without pay. TSA officers
screened over 2 million passengers and
their bags per day through the holi-
days, but they are not being paid. I
talked to some when I flew back from
Vermont. It is hurting. One has
healthcare bills. Another has a mort-
gage. They don’t know how they are
going to pay it.
Last week, House Democrats put for-
ward a commonsense path to end the
Trump shutdown. They introduced a
minibus comprised of six bipartisan ap-
propriations bills and a continuing res-
olution for the Department of Home-
land Security to keep it up and run-
ning through February 8.
The House is going to vote on both
these bills this evening. I expect they
will pass. After all, just a few weeks
ago, the same bills passed this Repub-
lican-controlled Senate unanimously.
We know the votes are there to pass.
I urge my friend, the majority leader,
Senator MCCONNELL, and Senate Re-
publicans to take up these bills expedi-
tiously. The six-bill minibus is not con-
troversial. Senator SHELBY is chairman
of the Appropriations Committee, I am
vice chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, and we both voted for
them, as have virtually all members of
the Appropriations Committee. There
is wide bipartisan support in this
Chamber. In fact, four of the six bills
passed the Senate 96 to 6. The other
two reported out of the Appropriations
Committee were nearly unanimous
votes. Why? Because they are a product
of bipartisan compromise. They pro-
vide billions of dollars in new resources
to address critical needs of the Amer-
ican people and to protect the U.S. na-
tional security.
It is irresponsible for the President
to hold these six bills hostage in order
to compel taxpayers to pay for his
wall, a wall he falsely promised Mexico
would pay for. If he would stop holding
them hostage, we could pass these bills
and send them to the President for sig-
nature. That would get the vast major-
ity of the Federal Government back
open for the good of the American peo-
ple. We ought to do that.
It also makes sense to pass a con-
tinuing resolution for the Department
of Homeland Security through Feb-
ruary 8. We should not shut down the
very Agency responsible for securing
our borders over a fight for what is the
best way to secure our border.
I will tell you what is not the best
way, to furlough everybody, stop pay-
ing them, close down the government.
Does that make us secure? Of course, it
does not. Everyone agrees—Repub-
licans and Democrats alike—we need to
keep our borders safe and secure. Let’s
have smart border security, border se-
curity that works—new technologies
proven to work on the border and our
ports of entry, new air and marine as-
sets, and additional personnel where
needed. We do not need a 30-foot medie-
val wall. I visited that border. I know
from the professionals who are there

what they need. They need a lot of re-
sources, the very last of which would
be a wall.
Let’s recall, before the holidays, the
President said he would sign a con-
tinuing resolution through February 8.
We had a path forward. We all relied on
the President’s word. After 24 hours of
FOX News and rightwing pundits criti-
cizing him, the President’s ego was so
bruised he reversed course and broke
his word. Here we are, 13 days into a
Trump shutdown.
It has to end. We have a clear, sen-
sible, responsible path forward. I
strongly urge the Senate Republicans
to support and pass this bipartisan
compromise. After all, almost every
Republican and every Democrat has
voted for these bills. Let’s vote for
them again and tell the President we
will work on what is needed for border
security. We all agree on the need for
border security. Let’s work on what is
the best way forward, but let’s not
close down the Department of Agri-
culture. Let’s not close down all these
other Departments that American tax-
payers rely on.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COL-
LINS). The Senator from Texas is recog-

f
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the
first order of business for the 116th
Congress is to finish the business of the
115th Congress, just concluded. As we
all know, one of the most important re-
sponsibilities of Congress is to fund the
vital services provided by our govern-
ment and in so doing provide pay-
checks to the hard-working public
servants who keep the cogs of govern-
ment turning.
While, as the distinguished Senator
from Vermont recognized, we were suc-
cessful in a bipartisan way to pass 75
percent of those funding bills, we know
the remaining 25 percent is being held
hostage over the issue of border secu-
rity. That equates to hundreds of thou-
sands of Federal workers and their
families who don’t know how or if they
can make their rent this month or buy
groceries or keep the lights on. They
simply don’t know when that next pay-
check will be deposited in their bank
account or how long the standoff will
last. That is unfair, and it is unaccept-
able collateral damage.
It is our collective responsibility to
fund the remaining seven Departments
and Agencies and to do so soon. Unfor-
tunately, over the holidays, not much
progress seems to have been made.
Really, what it amounts to is a debate
over semantics: Is it a fence? Is it a
wall? Is it border security? What is it?
The semantic debate has led us to a
partial government shutdown, now 13
days in and without a clear end in
sight. We know Washington, DC, where
the blame game is a world-class sport,
where everybody is on the battlefield
pointing fingers of blame any way they
can.
Later, the House Democrats will con-
sider a wholly unserious proposal that
funds the remaining portions of gov-
ernment without a significant invest-
ment in border security. I believe that
is a nonstarter. They know it, and we
know it. The President won’t sign it,
and so the majority leader has said it
will not be considered here in the Sen-
ate.
My constituents, as well as the Pre-
siding Officer’s constituents in Maine
and Americans living in Tennessee, are
not interested in show votes; they want
real border security—something our
Democratic colleagues used to support
and have voted for time and again. But
the debate has somehow shifted from
‘‘How do we solve this problem?’’ to
‘‘Who is going to win?’’ No longer is it
a search for solutions; it is about em-
barrassing your political opponent and
scoring points.
Yesterday on CNN, Alexandra Pelosi,
the daughter of incoming Speaker
NANCY PELOSI, made a comment about
her mother’s leadership style. She said:
‘‘She’ll cut your head off and you don’t
even know that you are bleeding.’’
Kind of shocking comments coming
from a daughter. It is not something I
necessarily would consider a com-
pliment, but the left appears to believe
that it is a commendable trait, and
they are eager to hand her the Speak-
er’s gavel.
It seems the desire to cultivate a rep-
utation for ruthlessness—win at all
costs—has replaced an appetite to ac-
tually get things done. Rather than
working with those with whom we oc-
casionally disagree, Members are re-
sorting to guerilla warfare—almost lit-
erally the law of the jungle. This prac-
tice is not only unproductive, it pre-
vents us from securing the border and
getting those workers impacted by this
partial shutdown back to work.
Of course we know what it is going to
take. It is going to take a negotiated
agreement between the parties—be-
tween the Houses of Congress and the
President. It is a challenging task, but
it is not impossible. In fact, we have
done it often.
My friends, contrary to what you
have seen in the news or may read on
social media, bipartisanship is not an
antiquated or quaint idea, and you
don’t have to look very far back to see
how we have been able to make biparti-
sanship work for the benefit of the
American people. The 115th Congress
was marked by major bipartisan ac-
complishments.
Just 2 weeks ago, the President
signed legislation to overhaul our
criminal justice system. This bill was a
result of a lot of hard work and tough
negotiations between Democrats and
Republicans on both ends of the Cap-
itol, as well as the leadership at the
White House. Bipartisan work has al-
lowed us to pass bills to tackle the sub-
stance abuse epidemic in this country,
which claimed more than 70,000 lives
last year alone. It has allowed us to
fight human trafficking together and
to reduce gun violence and other vio-
lent crime. Together, we have sup-
ported America’s military and deliv-
ered reforms to veterans’ benefits and
provided a pay raise to our troops. We
reauthorized the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration, modernizing airport se-
curity for the air-traveling public. We
eliminated the gag clause to ensure
drug price transparency. Those are just
a few of the things we have done to-
gether in a bipartisan way.
Working with those you disagree
with isn’t something to be ashamed
of—it is actually how we turn good
ideas into good laws and in so doing,
govern.
I am glad to see him on the floor be-
cause I was going to mention the great
example from our friend from Ten-
nessee, Senator ALEXANDER, who wrote
an op-ed in the Washington Post today
about the importance of finding com-
mon ground. He gave an object lesson
of how working together on very poten-
tially polarizing legislation can be ac-
complished in a way that produces a
result from which the American people
benefit. Of course, that was a lesson he
said he learned from negotiating with
President Obama while working on the
Every Student Succeeds Act.
He wrote:
Why, as a Republican, did I agree to a
Democratic president’s request with which I
did not concur? Because I have read the Con-
stitution, and I understand that if the Presi-
dent doesn’t sign legislation, it does not be-
come law.
Well, regardless of which party con-
trols the Senate or the House or occu-
pies the White House, that remains a
constant. It is the distilled essence of
our constitutional system. Democrats
in the House should take our col-
league’s wise words to heart and return
to the negotiating table with the Presi-
dent.
I believe there are a lot more produc-
tive ways to spend our time in Con-
gress than ruthlessly attempting to an-
nihilate our political opponents—peo-
ple we disagree with. We can, we have,
and we should strive to do better. So it
is time to wash off the war paint. We
know how to solve problems when we
want to, and as we begin a new Con-
gress, I urge all of our colleagues, both
Republican and Democratic, to stop
trying to score political points and
start being productive and in so doing,
govern.
Madam President, I yield the floor.

ator from Tennessee.

I appreciate the comments of the dis-
tinguished senior Senator from Texas.
I am glad to know that at least one
person read my article in the Wash-

I think we should be blunt about this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S12 January 3, 2019
is never an excuse for even a partial
shutdown of the federal government.
Government shutdowns should be as off
limits in bargaining over the budget,
for example, as chemical weapons are
in warfare.
Shutting down the government is not
a demonstration of skill or courage; it
is a demonstration of incompetence, of
a failure by negotiators. It is embar-
rassing. And the American people
ought to hold us accountable for that
because we are sent here to get a re-
sult. It takes no particular skill or
courage to take a position on an issue.
If all one wants to do is take a posi-
tion, you don’t have to go through all
the trouble of being elected to the U.S.
Senate; you could just stay home and
get a soap box, or you could get a radio
show or a TV show. There are plenty of
ways to take a position in this country.
The real skill or courage belongs to
those who first take their principled
positions and then work together to
get a result. That is what we do here
day in and day out.
The senior Senator from Texas gave
some examples of that. One of my fa-
vorite examples is what happened this
past fall. There we were—if you watch
television—in the midst of the
Kavanaugh nomination hearing, about
which there were enormous differences
of opinion—producing, I might add, a
historic speech by the Senator from
Maine toward the end of it.
One might have thought, well, all
they are doing in Washington, DC, is
just throwing mud at each other or at
Judge Kavanaugh. Well, that was one
side of the Capitol. I suggest you look
at what happens here as a split-screen
television. That was on one side of the
Capitol in the fall, but look at what
was happening on the other side.
Seventy-two U.S. Senators—about
half of them Democrat, half of them
Republican—were working together on
a bill to address, as the senior Senator
from Texas mentioned, the single big-
gest public health crisis in this coun-
try, the opioid problem. We passed
that, and it became law. That was done
in October on one side of the screen.
We also passed a bill—Senator HATCH
was a leader in that, and I worked on it
as well—a once-in-a-generation change
in the copyright laws, which helps
make sure songwriters are paid fairly.
Maybe that is not important to you; it
is to thousands of songwriters in Nash-
ville and Memphis and maybe in Los
Angeles and New York and around the
country. That happened in October.
Also in the fall, the Senate passed
Appropriations bills—75 percent of the
money for funding the federal govern-
ment, which included record funding
for the fourth consecutive year for bio-
medical research, record funding for
the fourth consecutive year for our Na-
tional Laboratories, and record funding
for the fourth consecutive year for
supercomputing.
A lot of other things were done this
fall. That is the split-screen television.
So we are not defined, really, by the
fights we have or by the positions we
take; we are defined and admired or
not admired by whether we have the
courage and the skill to come to a re-
sult.
Let me tell my colleagues a story
that I told in that piece that was print-
ed in the Washington Post today. It
comes from the summer of 2015 and
might offer a suggestion for how to re-
solve this government shutdown. There
is no excuse for having it, but we are
stuck in one, and we need to get out of
it.
In the summer of 2015, President
Obama invited Senator PATTY MURRAY,
the Democratic Senator from Wash-
ington State, and me down to the
White House for a meeting with him in
the Oval Office. I am chairman of the
Senate’s Education Committee, and
Senator MURRAY is the ranking Demo-
cratic member. What the President
wanted to talk about was our work in
Congress on trying to fix the law called
No Child Left Behind.
If you think resolving an impasse on
border security is difficult, try dealing
with K–12 education policy. Try setting
Federal policy for 100,000 public schools
in this country. It is like 100,000 spec-
tators at a University of Tennessee
football game, all of whom are sure
they are expert coaches and know ex-
actly what to call on the next play.
They all had a little football when they
were kids, and so they know what play
to call. All of us have a little edu-
cation, and so we know how to fix the
schools. Add to that the opinion of
Governors, the opinion of teachers
unions, the issues of federalism, of civil
rights, of overtesting, and common
core. And we had a divided government
in 2015—a Democratic President,
Barack Obama, and a Republican-ma-
jority Congress. It was in that environ-
ment that we were trying to fix No
Child Left Behind.
The President asked Senator MURRAY
and me to come meet with him pri-
vately in the Oval Office. On that day,
the President said to me and to Sen-
ator MURRAY that there were three
things he wanted in the legislation be-
fore he could sign it. I told the Presi-
dent that if he would not oppose the
bill as it made its way through the
Congress, those three things would be
in the final bill or I wouldn’t bring it
to him.
On December 10, 2015, President
Obama signed that bill. It is called the
Every Student Succeeds Act. He called
it a Christmas miracle even though
there were plenty of provisions in it he
didn’t agree with. The three things he
mentioned were included—I promised
him that—but there were plenty of
other things he did not agree with.
‘‘You kept your word,’’ he told me.
‘‘You did too,’’ I said to the President.
That is how you get a result when
you have divided government and
strongly held opinions.
Why, as a Republican, did I agree to
a Democratic President’s requests with
which I did not concur? Because I have
read the U.S. Constitution. That is
why. And I understand that if the
President does not sign a bill, it does
not become a law. On the other hand, I
knew that the entire law was historic
in what it was doing. The Wall Street
Journal said that it was the greatest
devolution of power from Washington,
DC, to the States in a quarter of a cen-
tury. It repealed the common core
mandate, dismantled the national
school board, and restored local control
of schools.
We worked on it for a long time. We
listened to each other. We made a lot
of changes. We came up with a result
that 85 Members of the U.S. Senate
eventually were able to vote for and
that the National Governors Associa-
tion and both of the major teachers
unions could support. The result will
be that Federal education policy on K–
12 will be stable for years to come for
the teachers in those 100,000 public
schools and the school superintendents
and the parents. Nobody even sug-
gested in all of those negotiations
shutting down the government to get
his or her way. We all knew we were
elected to get a result if we could.
Let me tell you another short story.
The next year, we were working on
something called 21st Century Cures.
Same President—Obama. Same Con-
gress—Republican. Very complicated
issues. How do you get biomedical re-
search funded and through the Food
and Drug Administration in a way that
people approve of and would agree to?
That is much more complicated than
you would expect. I worked with Presi-
dent Obama, who wanted precision
medicine. That was in there. Vice
President Biden wanted a cancer moon-
shot. His son had died from cancer the
previous year. That was in there. Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, the majority leader,
said he wanted something on regenera-
tive medicine. That was in there.
Speaker RYAN said he wouldn’t approve
it unless it had funding in a particular
way, so we did it that way. Still we
were having a hard time with it. I re-
member calling Vice President Biden
at one point late in the year of 2016 and
saying: Joe, I am standing here, and I
have this all tied up with a ribbon
around it. It had all of what I just de-
scribed in there—precision medicine,
cancer moonshot, funding for bio-
medical research, and regenerative
medicine. I said: I feel like the butler
standing outside the door of the Oval
Office with an order on a silver platter,
and no one will open the door. The Vice
President said: If you want to feel like
a butler, try being the Vice President.
Well, he went to work, and that bill
was signed in December of 2016. Sen-
ator MCCONNELL said that it was the
most important legislation of the Con-
gress. That wasn’t because I took a po-
sition, and President Obama took a po-
sition, and the Vice President took a
position. It was because we worked to-
gether, understanding that we had to
agree to get a result.
So what is the lesson for today?
First, Democrats should recognize, as I

did with President Obama in 2015 on
fixing No Child Left Behind and in 2016
on 21st Century Cures and on other
issues, that when a President elected
by the people of the United States—
whatever you may think of him—has a
legitimate objective, you should bend
over backward to try to meet that ob-
jective if you want a result.
As for the President, in this case
President Trump, I would suggest that
he should be as specific and reliable as
President Obama was in 2015 when he
told me he needed three things in order
to sign a bill. When Congress passed a
bill with those three things in it, even
though it included some other things
the President didn’t like, he signed the
law.
Since President Trump has made it
clear that he will not sign any legisla-
tion to reopen the Federal Government
without some increase in funding for
border security, here are three options
for where we could go from here to get
out of this hole we have dug for our-
selves.
No. 1, go small. Give the President
the $1.6 billion he asked for in this
year’s budget request, which the bipar-
tisan Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee, which the Senator from Maine
and I serve, approved. Throw in an-
other $1 billion to improve border secu-
rity at ports of entry, which everyone
agrees we need.
Even better, go bigger. Pass the bill
that 54 Senators—I believe we are talk-
ing about the Collins-King bill—voted
on last February, which combined a so-
lution for children brought to the
United States illegally, the Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals or
DACA. The President said he was for
that. Then add $25 billion in appro-
priated funding for border security
over 10 years. That is not $5 billion or
$1.6 billion or $3 billion; that is $25 bil-
lion appropriated for border security,
which 46 Democrats voted for last Feb-
ruary. The bill failed only because of
last-minute White House opposition.
Even better, go really big. Begin this
new Congress by creating a legal immi-
gration system that secures our bor-
ders and defines the status of those al-
ready here. In 2013, 68 U.S. Senators,
including all 54 Democrats, voted for
such a bill, but the House refused to
take it up. That bill, which all 54
Democrats voted for, included over $40
billion and many other provisions to
secure our borders.
So there are three ways to turn this
lemon into lemonade, so to speak—
three ways to dig out of this hole we
have dug for ourselves. Instead of say-
ing that once we dig ourselves a hole,
we should keep digging forever, climb
out of it in a graceful way by solving a
big problem.
Someone asked me in the hall re-
cently: Well, why would President
Trump agree to such a thing?
Why would he not agree to such a
thing? I have said to the President on
more than one occasion that when
touring the White House, you can look
at the portraits of the Presidents. You
see President Nixon, and what do you
think? Nixon and China. You see Presi-
dent Reagan, and what do you think?
Reagan and the Soviet Union. But
Nixon was not always for a relation-
ship with Communist China; he was op-
posed to it. Reagan was the biggest
critic of the Soviet Union in our coun-
try. Yet the two of them took those
credentials, and they tackled a big
problem, and they made a historic con-
tribution to this country.
I believe President Trump could and
should do the same thing. We could go
small or we could go a little bigger,
and pass the Collins-King bill—or
something close to it—that we voted
for. I would like to see the President
say: OK, we have a new Congress; we
have divided government. I am the
President who can actually make this
happen. I believe the American people
would trust me if I said that we were
creating a comprehensive legal immi-
gration system.
Get us unstuck from this partial gov-
ernment shutdown, and go real big on
immigration. That could be President
Trump’s Nixon-to-China, Reagan-to-
the-Berlin-Wall moment in history.
I thank the Presiding Officer.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PORTMAN). The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
LANKFORD). Without objection, it is so

SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today
is a little like opening day here in the
U.S. Senate. We have seen some of our
colleagues—incumbents who were al-
ready elected—walk down this aisle, to
be sworn in, after winning 6-year
terms. We have also seen some new
Members come in from all around the
country who are from both parties.
Just like every opening day, there is a
certain sense of optimism in the air. I
just went to a number of receptions for
Democrats and Republicans alike, and
people are talking about the need for
us to work together.
We are also facing a new reality, and
that is we have divided government
now. Before, we had a Republican
House and Senate and a Republican
President. Now we have a Democratic-
led House to go along with the Repub-
lican Senate and a Republican White
House. We haven’t had a divided gov-
ernment for a little while; yet our jobs
don’t change at all as our job is to fig-
ure out how to work together to get
things done. Frankly, here in the U.S.
Senate, we need 60 votes for almost
anything, which requires a super-
majority, which has always been the
case. Really, there has been only one
way to accomplish things around here
on behalf of the people we represent,
which has been to figure out how to
find that common ground. It is time to
get back to doing that on some of these
big issues. I would suggest to you that
on issues like, maybe, healthcare and
immigration, we have had a gridlock
situation, where we just can’t seem to
figure out even how to get started.
I will say that in 2018, the year that
just passed, we did make progress in
some areas, and it is worth reflecting
on that and talking about how that
happened, because that would be the
model for the future.
We made progress on combating the
opioid epidemic that has gripped this
country, and it is the worst public
health crisis we have in this country
now. In October, President Trump
signed opioid legislation into law that
contains a number of different ways to
push back against this issue. In my
home State of Ohio, it is the No. 1
cause of death now. Nationally, it is
the No. 1 cause of death for those under
age 50. We had over 70,000 people die in
this country last year alone from
opioid overdoses. So the President
signed legislation into law that will
help.
One piece of legislation is called the
STOP Act. It is something that we
worked on for 3 years. In fact, it came
out of some work that we did on the
Permanent Subcommittee on Inves-
tigations. I and the Presiding Officer
here today are on the committee, and
we are able to work together—Repub-
licans and Democrats alike—and do
deep investigations into issues that
then result in good legislation. In this
case, we found out that more people
are dying of fentanyl overdoses—the
most deadly of all of the drugs now—of
synthetic opioids than of any other
drug.
We found out that it comes in
through the U.S. mail system, pri-
marily, and from China. We are really
doing virtually nothing to provide the
screening to try to keep some of this
poison out of our communities. So that
is now in place. Just a couple of weeks
ago, I also met with the Postmaster
General and with the head of Customs
and Border Protection—the two indi-
viduals who are the most responsible
for its implementation—to talk about
how we can more quickly implement
that legislation to save lives.
The bill also includes some other leg-
islation that we worked on for years.
One is to remove an arbitrary cap on
the ability of people to get treatment.
Some treatment centers were capped at
16 beds just because they took Med-
icaid funding. That made no sense.
There are some good treatment centers
out there that were turning people
away. These people are addicted. If
they don’t get into treatment, they are
going to continue to have their addic-
tions and continue to cause crimes and
continue to break up families and
cause all kinds of problems for our
criminal justice system. So that is a

positive part of what has happened
here.
We also passed legislation in that
package to help care for pregnant and
postpartum women who are addicted
and for their children and for babies
who are born with this neonatal absti-
nence syndrome—dependent on drugs,
essentially—and to help get them
through life.
Last year, we passed important legis-
lation that is already having an enor-
mous impact to push back on another
topic that we studied in the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations,
which I talked about earlier. That is
legislation that deals with the traf-
ficking of women and children. So
much of that has moved online. Our re-
search indicates that most of it was
happening, actually, on one website,
called backpage. We wrote legislation
that enabled the victims to go after
some of these websites if they had been
exploited but also to allow prosecutors,
including the prosecutors in your
States and your cities and your coun-
ties, to go after some of these groups
online that were knowingly trafficking
women and children.
As a result of that, we have made
huge progress. It took 3 years of inves-
tigation and legislating to get there,
but that legislation now, in its having
become law, according to the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Chil-
dren, has resulted in substantial de-
creases in the online sex trafficking of
women and children. Lives have been
saved. Those who were not able to pur-
sue God’s purpose in life are now able
to because no longer are they being
trafficked.
In addition, the permanent sub-
committee’s report helped the Depart-
ment of Justice indict this worst actor
in the online trafficking arena,
backpage, as well as its executives. We
were able to shut down the website al-
together because of that. So we have
made progress.
The year 2018 was also the first year
of the new Tax Code that has made
American workers and American com-
panies far more competitive. It is re-
sponsible, more than any other thing,
for the fact that we not only have more
jobs in this country and historically
low unemployment numbers now but
also higher wages. Over the past few
months, we have seen where we have
had, for the first time, really, in a dec-
ade and a half, rising wages relative to
inflation so that people who are work-
ing hard and playing by the rules are
feeling that they are getting ahead
again. A couple of months ago, there
was a 3-percent increase from the pre-
vious year. That is something you
want to see happen continually, and
this tax reform, because it encourages
investment in jobs and expansion, is
having that impact.
The year 2018 was also the year we
provided more funding for our brave
men and women in uniform who are
out there protecting us every day. Our
military was not able to do its job be-
cause we didn’t have adequate re-
sources. We were able to do that in 2018
on a bipartisan basis.
So there have been some examples of
bipartisanship that have made a big
difference. Again, we should look at
those and determine what happened
there. Why were we stuck on one issue;
yet, on others, we were able to make
progress? I would suggest to you that
there are four or five other issues that
are at the point at which they have
enough bipartisan support that we
should be able to get them done this
year.
I know people say: Well, we are get-
ting into the 2020 election. Folks, it is
only 2019. We are only a couple of days
into it. Let’s not talk about the 2020
election. Let’s not focus on what hap-
pens on the talk shows and what hap-
pens on the op-ed pages and what hap-
pens in terms of the red meat speeches
being thrown out from both sides. In-
stead, let’s focus on what we can do
this year, in 2019—there is no election
this year—to actually make progress
on some of these issues. Some of them
are ones that affect all of our constitu-
ents in very fundamental ways. Others,
perhaps, are not as significant.
Right now, we have an opportunity
to break this gridlock and to stop the
partial government shutdown and to
also make some reforms in the immi-
gration system as we do it.
The appropriations process for fund-
ing our Federal Government is stuck
right now. There are 7 bills out of 12
that have not been passed. Of those
seven, six have been agreed to by this
body and the other body. Republicans
and Democrats alike have voted for
them, so we should get them done.
As we try to figure out a way for-
ward, we should also be sure that we do
two things: Stop the partial govern-
ment shutdown—which makes no
sense, particularly for taxpayers,
which I will explain in a second—and
strengthen our border.
Of course we should strengthen the
border. There are a lot of bad things
happening on the border. One, of
course, is people coming across ille-
gally. That is something none of us
should want to see. We want to see a
legal process. I think it is true that
pretty much everybody in this Cham-
ber understands we have to have a se-
cure border, and there is not a secure
border now. Some of it requires new
fencing. Some of it requires other
kinds of barriers. Some of it requires
more technology and more people to
respond when somebody breaches a
fence or a wall. We all know that. We
know there has to be more funding pro-
vided there. We should be able to do
that.
At the same time, we should also re-
alize that with regard to government
shutdowns, as I said earlier, they really
don’t accomplish much because we al-
ways go back and repay the workers
who have not been working on behalf of
all of us. In these shutdowns, taxpayers
always end up having to pay more, not
less.
With regard to the shutdown right
now, I don’t think it is political lever-
age in particular because I think that
some of those who are more partisan
on the other side of the aisle are happy
to have it continue, thinking it is good
for them politically. Let’s take the pol-
itics out of it. Let’s stop shutdowns al-
together.
There is legislation that has been in-
troduced called End Government Shut-
downs. Actually, when the Presiding
Officer was in the House of Representa-
tives, he was one of the leaders on that
and still supports this idea. The notion
is, if you don’t finish an appropriations
bill or if a continuing resolution ex-
pires—which is short-term, temporary
funding instead of an appropriations
bill—instead of having a shutdown,
what you do is continue spending from
the previous year. Then slowly, over
time—1 percent after 120 days, another
1 percent after 90 days, and so on—you
reduce that funding to give the Appro-
priations Committee around here and
our leadership some incentive to come
to the table and resolve the issues.
I just don’t think shutdowns work. I
have never quite understood it. Again,
from a taxpayer’s perspective, I don’t
think it makes much sense.
We are going to reintroduce the End
Government Shutdowns bill again next
week. It has been bipartisan in the
past. I hope it will be bipartisan next
week when we reintroduce it. Let’s get
that done. At the same time, let’s fig-
ure out ways to have more security at
our borders. Everybody agrees with
that. I hope we can find a way to get to
some common ground.
When we got into this issue last year,
along with Senators THUNE and MORAN,
I introduced legislation that would pro-
vide $25 billion over a 5-year period to
support this plan for a more secure bor-
der, including the plan from the Trump
administration, while at the same time
providing legal certainty to those
young people who came to the United
States illegally as children through no
fault of their own. Some have called
these children, who are now young peo-
ple, part of the DACA Program. You
have heard that word, D-A-C-A, DACA.
These are people who came here as kids
without going through the proper
channels. They shouldn’t be punished
for that, so let’s codify the administra-
tive action that has been taken, and
let’s combine that with the funding. To
me, that seems to be one where Repub-
licans and Democrats could each find
some opportunity for a victory. The
win-win would then allow us to reopen
the government and to move ahead
with broader immigration reform, hav-
ing had a little bit of success on at
least one small part of the immigra-
tion issues we face. I think this is an
example where, if both sides can give a
little, we won’t have a shutdown any-
more, and we can move ahead on some
other legislation.
I want to talk about some of those
other priorities that we could easily

address this year because they are bi-
partisan. In some cases, they had al-
ready been worked on for years, and in
other cases, for months. Frankly, just
before we broke for the holidays, we
came close to passing some of those.
One is for us to reform the tax collec-
tion agency, the IRS. Everybody
should want to do this because, once
again, the IRS is not serving taxpayers
as they should. I say ‘‘once again’’ be-
cause about 20 years ago, Congress
took on this task and formed a com-
mission. Actually, I was co-chair of it
with Senator Bob Kerrey. We passed
legislation to improve the customer
service of the IRS but also to give
them more money for technology so
they could do a better job with regard
to enforcing the tax laws.
At that time, the IRS was in really
tough shape. They weren’t answering
the phone. When they did, they weren’t
providing right information. The Agen-
cy suffered from wasteful spending,
from low workforce morale, and from a
lack of leadership and strategic direc-
tion. Guess what. That is happening
again—all of those things.
We now have a new Commissioner
who has just been confirmed. I am very
hopeful he will make a difference
there, but he needs our help legisla-
tively—give him some tools to use.
This new Commissioner, along with his
new team, is eager to have those re-
forms. They think it is a prime oppor-
tunity to update what happens at the
IRS and to be sure it is serving tax-
payers better.
My hope is that calls will begin to be
answered again and that we will get
correct answers when we call to find an
answer to a tax law question. We have
now simplified the tax law in certain
ways. We have also made it more com-
plicated in other ways with this new
tax reform legislation, so there are a
lot of questions out there. Our legisla-
tion would be very helpful.
By the way, 20 years ago, we decided
to include an independent appeal of an
IRS decision. It is very important. To
me, it is sort of a fundamental right. If
the IRS is saying you are wrong about
something, you should have the ability
to appeal it and to have an independent
forum.
Over the last 10 years or so, the IRS
has kind of moved away from that. The
appeals have declined because the IRS
has chosen to settle a lot of cases in
tax court, costing taxpayers a lot more
money. Our legislation, which has been
bipartisan, will help to create a new,
independent appeals process. The Com-
missioner supports that. It is a way to
ensure we have, frankly, more faith
and confidence in the IRS, having that
independent appeal.
We also give more structure to what
is called the IRS Oversight Board. This
was established 20 years ago. It worked
for a while. It hasn’t worked for the
past 10 years. It is basically not in ex-
istence anymore. So we said: Let’s es-
tablish this very simply so that it fo-
cuses on long-term, strategic goals for
the Agency, so it doesn’t again fall
back into the situation it is in now,
with bad technology, bad customer
service, and so on, and let’s set up this
oversight board in the right way.
Senator BEN CARDIN and I have intro-
duced legislation called the Protecting
Taxpayers Act. We almost got it done
at the end of the year last year, just a
few weeks ago. My hope is that we can
get this legislation up and get it passed
very, very quickly. We have already
had hearings on it in the Senate Fi-
nance Subcommittee on Taxation and
IRS Oversight, which I chair. My hope
is that we can get that to a final vote
very soon.
Another opportunity we have is to
expand retirement savings. That is
something which is very important to
a lot of my constituents who are find-
ing themselves in a situation where
they thought they had saved enough,
but they hadn’t. People are living
longer, healthier lives, and unfortu-
nately the amount they have saved in
their IRA or their 401(k) or what they
have in their pension plan is not
enough for them to have a secure re-
tirement.
We have done this in the past. Again,
we have worked together in a bipar-
tisan way over the years to try to in-
crease what people can save for their
own retirement. In fact, Senator
CARDIN, a Democrat from Maryland,
and I have worked together in a bipar-
tisan way going back a couple of dec-
ades. We had three different bills that
expanded how much you could put
away in a 401(k) or an IRA and have
catchup contributions if you are over
50 and changing the rules to make it
easier for small businesses to provide
plans. Unfortunately, it is time to do
that again so that people can set more
aside for their golden years and have
more peace of mind in retirement.
The numbers are pretty interesting.
After our three pieces of legislation
back in 1997, 2001, and 2006, we did see
more savings. In fact, nationwide,
growth of 401(k)s and other defined
contribution plan savings, IRA savings,
expanded pretty dramatically. There
has been a 179-percent increase in
401(k)s in the last 17, 18 years and a 254-
percent increase in IRAs. So we have
shown that by passing legislation that
provides more opportunity for people
to save for their own retirement, more
money is being put in.
However, having had those successes
in moving retirement savings from
about $11 trillion in 2001 to $28 trillion
today, there is still a lot more to be
done. My generation, the baby boom
generation, just isn’t saving enough for
their retirement, and the same is true
with the succeeding generation. Young
people aren’t putting enough aside, and
we need to give them that incentive to
do more because, frankly, that is a
much more effective way for us to im-
prove their chances of having a secure
retirement, not depending solely on So-
cial Security, and also to help our
economy, because more savings is a
good thing for our private sector econ-
omy.
Even today, only just over half of the
employees who work in private compa-
nies have a company plan. I think they
should all have one. We should make it
so easy that every company says: You
know what, you come work for me, and
I am going to provide you with a 401(k).
Maybe it is a simple plan, which is
something we want to work on to try
to create a new, very simple plan for
small businesses because a lot of small
businesses don’t have the professionals,
the H.R. people—the human resources
people—to do it. That is part of what
we have in our legislation. We need to
do more to help part-time workers in
particular. We need to do more to en-
sure that the smallest businesses have
an opportunity to have savings plans.
Before the end of last year, just a
couple of weeks ago, we introduced this
legislation. It is called Portman-Cardin
2.0—the Retirement Security & Sav-
ings Act. It has more than 50 provi-
sions. It is a culmination of many
years of work with various stake-
holders to come up with stuff that
makes sense.
Among other things, it establishes
new automatic enrollment safe har-
bors. It does raise the catchup con-
tribution limits. It allows individuals
to make additional catchup contribu-
tions after age 60. It would also expand
the saver’s credit for low-income fami-
lies and make that refundable. To en-
sure that Americans don’t outlive their
savings, the bill exempts any savers
with less than $100,000 in aggregate sav-
ings from the currently required min-
imum distributions from their 401(k) or
IRA. Right now, at age 701⁄2, you have
to start taking it out. For many people
who are working into their seventies,
this makes no sense at all. You have
worked your whole life. You are still
working into your seventies, as my dad
was, and you are told: You have to
start taking money from your retire-
ment account, or we are going to pe-
nalize you. Our legislation says that if
you have less than $100,000 in savings,
you shouldn’t be subject to the min-
imum requirements at all. For others,
we raised it from 701⁄2 up to 75 years old
over time to ensure that those who are
in their seventies don’t start depleting
their retirement accounts when they
may well need them, as they are,
again, living longer and longer lives.
Let’s continue our work to focus on
helping people save for their own re-
tirement. That is something we can do
on a bipartisan basis.
We also have a little issue that is
growing dramatically with regard to
defined retirement plans, defined ben-
efit plans—not defined contribution
plans, like the 401(k)—and specifically
what are called multiemployer plans.
You may have heard about this, but if
you haven’t, you probably will if we
don’t do something because it looks
like, by the year 2025, the Federal in-
surance program called the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation will go

insolvent because of these plans not
being properly funded.
Some of these plans are very big.
There are about 60,000 people in the
State of Ohio who are in one of these
plans, including the Central States
plan. If it goes belly-up, it will result
in the PBGC—the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation—going belly-up.
That insolvency would then create
problems for all plans, including sin-
gle-employer plans, not just these mul-
tiemployer plans we are talking about.
We need a bipartisan solution for
that. We came close to it last year. We
had a joint select committee formed to
look at it. Again, that should be bipar-
tisan—really, nonpartisan. If we don’t
solve this problem, it is going to have
a big impact on our economy because
not only does the Federal guaranty
program go bankrupt, but a lot of busi-
nesses that rely on that are going to go
bankrupt as well.
Finally, to continue our progress in
combating the opioid epidemic, which
we talked about earlier, we need to
take the next step. There is new legis-
lation called the Comprehensive Addic-
tion and Recovery Act 2.0, referring to
the same legislation, the Comprehen-
sive Addiction and Recovery Act,
CARA, which was passed here in this
body 21⁄2 years ago. That legislation is
to do more in terms of treatment, re-
covery, and specifically prevention.
It also deals with this issue that we
don’t have effective drug-monitoring
programs back in our States. Often, if
someone gets a prescription for opioids,
they wouldn’t know whether that per-
son already had that prescription.
They also don’t know if somebody has
crossed the State line. In my State of
Ohio, people might cross over to Michi-
gan or Indiana or Kentucky or West
Virginia, as they do—all States that
have opioid problems, as well—and get
a prescription filled there, and we in
Ohio don’t know it is a doubling up of
prescriptions when they go to a phar-
macy in Ohio. We need to work better
to ensure that we have an interstate
system. That is in this legislation.
We also have a limitation on pre-
scriptions for acute pain. This is based
on the Centers for Disease Control—the
CDC—guidelines. They tell you that
after 3 days of taking opioids for acute
pain, it is far more likely that you are
going to become addicted to pain medi-
cation. Obviously, this is a huge prob-
lem that we want to stop. So much of
this opioid addiction—even the
fentanyl addiction we have now, the
synthetic opioids coming in—started
with prescription drugs. It often start-
ed with legally prescribed prescription
drugs.
Again, this says that for those who
are prescribed drugs after a surgery,
let’s say for acute pain—not chronic
pain, not cancer, but acute pain—there
should be a 3-day limit. This is based
on CDC research that has been done.
It is also based on the research being
done by the FDA about how pain medi-
cation works. They say opioid medica-
tion may be helpful for somebody that
has a serious pain issue after an oper-
ation, say, acute pain. But after the
first couple of days, it is much more
likely to be handled through something
less dangerous, like ibuprofen. So there
is not a need to have a continual use of
opioids. Getting a 3-day national limit
in place alone would have a huge im-
pact on overdoses going forward, be-
cause it starts with an addiction and
leads to the overdoses. For over 70,000
Americans last year, this led to not
just an overdose but to overdose
deaths—the No. 1 cause of death among
people under 50 in our country today. It
also requires hospitals and doctors to
not just use these prescription drug
monitoring programs but to share that
data to prevent people from cheating
the system and getting prescription
drugs they shouldn’t be getting.
Around the holidays, the New York
Times did an interesting three-part
study on the issue of addiction. I found
it very helpful and commend it to you.
It is about the science of addiction and
some simple information about how
these drugs essentially hijack your
brain. This is a 2-page foldout that was
in the New York Times just before
Christmas. It goes through the various
stages—from the gateway to opioids we
talked about earlier, often from pre-
scription drugs, tolerance and with-
drawal symptoms, addiction, treat-
ment, relapse, and recovery. If you
haven’t seen it, you can find it online.
I would recommend it. It is in very
simple language—talking to addicts,
talking to experts, and giving people a
simple sense of what happens here and
what we can do to address it.
What we can do is much better on the
prevention side—again, more informa-
tion out there on understanding how
dangerous these drugs are, but, second,
getting people who are already ad-
dicted into treatment. This is in every-
one’s interest, including our law en-
forcement officials, who are tired of ar-
resting the same people again and
again for the same crimes, usually
property crimes associated with paying
for their habit—the No. 1 cause of
crime in my State of Ohio. But it is
also incredibly important for our fami-
lies who are being broken apart and for
so many of our healthcare systems,
emergency rooms, and neonatal units
in hospitals which are overwhelmed
with these babies with neonatal absti-
nence syndrome. There is a huge cost
and impact of that on individuals, on
families, and on taxpayers.
It is something that is affecting em-
ployers in big ways now. When I look
at the numbers in terms of what is hap-
pening in our economy, the biggest
issue in terms of workforce is people
who are not in the workforce at all
anymore. That is at historically high
levels. They aren’t even applying for
jobs. Among men, it is probably at his-
toric levels. On men and women com-
bined, you would have to go back to
the late 1970s to see such low levels of
participation in the workforce, when
we had double-digit unemployment,
double-digit interest rates, and double-
digit inflation. We don’t want that
again. When you look at why these
people aren’t working, it is dramatic
how many of these people are addicted,
and opioids is driving these numbers at
a time when there should be many
more people engaging in the workforce.
The jobs are there. The jobs are open
and not being filled. Often, people can’t
pass the drug test if they are looking,
because of their opioid addiction. So it
is affecting us in every way, including
our economy and workforce.
To address these issues, this CARA
2.0 legislation will help, as will the leg-
islation we passed last year with re-
gard to the synthetic opioids and with
regard to providing more treatment for
people. If we keep up these efforts and
continue to pass legislation that ad-
dresses the specific problems out there,
I think this year, 2019, we will see the
tide turning. We will see fewer addic-
tions. We will see fewer deaths from
overdoses. We will see more families
not broken apart but coming back to-
gether. We will see our communities
begin to heal because we are beginning
to make progress. It is not showing up
in all the numbers yet, but I see it
back home with regard to individual
regions and cities and with regard to
communities doing an awesome job,
with volunteers coming together and
using some of the tools we have been
giving them to have a more effective
prevention campaign and also to get
people into treatment. Where that is
working, they are making a huge dif-
ference. So I am hopeful that in 2019, if
we can keep this up, on a bipartisan
basis, we will be able to see this
progress be manifested in our commu-
nities.
There is plenty more to be done this
year. I joined a bipartisan group of col-
leagues on the Senate floor just before
the holidays, calling on the Senate to
pass the Restore Our Parks Act, which
is to deal with the $12 billion mainte-
nance backlog at our national parks.
Things are falling apart—roads,
bridges, water systems—and it is a
shame because it is really a debt that
is owed. We aren’t keeping up because
our annual budget doesn’t provide
money for these so-called capital ex-
penses. Yet, if we don’t deal with them,
it becomes far more expensive. If the
roof isn’t fixed because it is too expen-
sive, what happens? You have the en-
tire building—as is happening at one of
our great parks in Ohio—which has to
be rebuilt at a huge cost to the tax-
payer. So there is an opportunity
here—again, on a bipartisan way—to
deal with this long overdue mainte-
nance at our national parks. The ad-
ministration supports it, our Energy
and Natural Resources Committee has
voted it out of committee with a
strong bipartisan vote. The House of
Representatives supports it on a bipar-
tisan basis. Let’s get it done.
There has also been talk of a major
infrastructure compromise. We need

that. Our roads and bridges are crum-
bling, generally, not just at our parks.
We need an infrastructure bill. Maybe
the parks bill will be the start of that.
We will see if that can be something
where we can find compromise.
Of course, we also have to make
progress on healthcare. The costs of
healthcare are out of control. I know
Senator ALEXANDER talked about this
earlier on the floor today, but there are
so many opportunities for us to im-
prove our healthcare system and the
cost and the quality of that system. It
is something that has been very dif-
ficult and very partisan. It has been
difficult for us to make any progress on
that, but I think we have to put our
partisan blinders away and say: How
can we come up with sensible solu-
tions? Some have talked about it today
on the floor. Senator COLLINS, who was
here earlier today as Presiding Officer,
has specific legislation to have these
high-risk pools in States—it has
worked in her State of Maine, and it
can work nationally—to be sure that
we are reducing the cost for everybody
for their premiums, deductibles, and
copays.
I think the American people are
looking for wins right now. I think it
would help our country to have some of
these wins. I think there are some
great examples I have presented today
of some pretty easy wins, of some low-
hanging fruit—whether it is dealing
with these issues that we are left with
here with the government shutdown,
making some small steps forward on
immigration reform right away, or
whether it is low-hanging fruit like the
reform of the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice, the retirement savings expansion,
so people can save more for retirement,
and this idea that we can begin to turn
the tide on the opioid epidemic, which
has gripped our country. It doesn’t
have to be a year of gridlock. It can be
a year of progress.
My hope is that on this opening day,
as Members are walking down the aisle
and are here with their families and
celebrating and the optimism of open-
ing day and thinking that hope springs
eternal, this can be a good season. This
can be a good year. This can be a year
where we focus on what is best for the
people we represent and focus on what
is best for our country. If we do that, I
think we will make a difference, and I
think we will look back and realize
that it doesn’t have to be this way.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND
NATIONAL SECURITY
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, as we
begin a new Congress, it is always an
exciting time. There are a lot of fami-
lies and friends here. Our Members and
colleagues were sworn in earlier today.
It represents a new beginning—obvi-
ously, a time when there is hope and
optimism that we can come together
and do some good things for the people
we represent in our respective States
and for our country. That is the way
we approach this new session of Con-
gress.
There is a lot I think we can do. We
can find some common ground and
work together. Obviously, we have to
deal with the issues of last year’s busi-
ness before we can start this business
of this new year.
Last year’s business is incomplete.
We are almost 2 weeks into a partial
government shutdown because Demo-
crats don’t want to fund increased se-
curity for the border. Border security
is a national security requirement.
Every Member of Congress, Democrat
or Republican, should take seriously
our responsibility to protect our Na-
tion by ensuring that our borders are
secure. At one time Democrats under-
stood that.
In 2006, the Democratic leader and
the ranking member of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee voted for legisla-
tion to authorize a border fence. They
were joined in that vote by then-Sen-
ators Biden, Clinton, and Obama. In
2013, every Senate Democrat supported
legislation requiring the completion of
a 700-mile fence along our southern
border. This legislation would have
provided $46 billion for border security
and $8 billion specifically for the wall.
Nearly every Senate Democrat sup-
ported $25 billion in border security
funding just last February—just re-
cently, less than 1 year ago. Yet today,
Democrats would rather keep part of
the government shut down than pro-
vide the money needed to secure our
borders. The question is, What has
changed?
Our national security situation cer-
tainly hasn’t changed. Our borders are
not sufficiently secure, and as we have
seen, they are a target for illegal
entry. Over the past year, illegal bor-
der crossing apprehensions have shot
up by more than 30 percent. The holes
in our border security leave us suscep-
tible to illegal entry by gang members,
human traffickers, drug dealers, terror-
ists, and weapons traffickers. The
Democrats are refusing to budge on
sorely needed border security funding.
Why? I think that is a fair question.
It is, I think, because Democrats are
reluctant to oppose the far-left wing of
their party, which increasingly seems
to be advancing this preposterous no-
tion that we really don’t need to secure
our borders at all. Every nation has to
secure its borders. A country without
borders really isn’t a country. Pre-
venting dangerous individuals and
goods from entering is an essential
part of every country’s security, and as
my Democratic colleagues have proved
in the past, they know this, which is
why they voted that way in previous
sessions of Congress, as recently as last
year.
I hope they will think better of this
government shutdown and decide that
their national security obligations are
more important than catering to the
far-left wing of their party. It is time
to fund our border security and to end
this shutdown. It simply requires sides
to come together to find that common
ground and to do what is in our coun-
try’s best interests and the best inter-
ests of the American people; that is, to
make sure that our country has a se-
cure border and that we discourage
people from coming here illegally and
encourage them to come through legal
means.
I had the opportunity a couple of
weeks ago in my State of South Da-
kota to welcome into our State and
country 99 new citizens from 33 coun-
tries around the world. They came here
the legal way. They went through the
process and followed our rules, followed
our laws. That is what we want to en-
courage more of.
What we don’t need more of are peo-
ple coming into this country illegally
and presenting the types of threats I
mentioned earlier—anytime we have
that many people, in a mass way, mi-
grating across our border. I hope and
sincerely believe that as a Congress, as
a Senate working with this President—
who has made this a big priority for his
administration—it is an important pri-
ority for our country and a require-
ment and obligation that I think we all
have as U.S. Senators, first and fore-
most, to protect our country and to
protect the American people. If we
don’t get that right, the rest is really
just conversation.
I hope the Democrats will come to
the conclusion that their statements in
the past and their votes in the past in
support of border security are the right
way to proceed and will continue in
that tradition we have had in the coun-
try in the past in which, on these im-
portant issues, both sides come to-
gether and work to find common
ground.
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO MICKEY MILLER
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this
month my friend Mickey Miller will re-
tire from Nolin Rural Electric Coopera-
tive Corporation, Nolin RECC, after 45
years at the organization, including
more than a quarter century as its
president and CEO. Mickey has dedi-
cated his career to providing reliable,
cost-effective energy services to Ken-
tuckians in nine counties with integ-
rity and innovation. I would like to
take a moment to reflect on his re-
markable career in our Common-
wealth.
From LaRue County, Mickey grad-
uated from the University of Kentucky
with a degree in agriculture economics
and marketing. During his time at
Nolin RECC, Mickey has championed a
great deal of growth and advancement.
In fact, the cooperative’s membership
has more than tripled, providing vital
services to Kentucky families and em-
ployers and fueling development in the
region.

S18 January 3, 2019
Mickey’s contributions extend be-
yond his work with Nolin RECC. As the
chairman of the Kentucky Council of
Cooperatives and the director of the
Kentucky Association of Electric Co-
operatives, Mickey has been a strong
advocate for affordable and reliable
electricity programs throughout the
Commonwealth. He also has served on
the board of the United Utility Supply
Cooperative, providing for the needs of
communities across 19 States. Pre-
viously, Mickey led energy coopera-
tives throughout the Nation as the
chairman of Touchstone Energy.
In addition to his many business suc-
cesses, Mickey has also committed
himself to the betterment of his com-
munity. As an executive board member
of the Lincoln Heritage Council of the
Boy Scouts of America, Mickey is dedi-
cated to helping prepare the next gen-
eration to excel. He also worked to en-
courage economic growth in his com-
munity through his involvement with
the Elizabethtown—Hardin County In-
dustrial Foundation.
I would like to particularly recognize
one part of Mickey’s work for his com-
munity: saluting our Nation’s vet-
erans. Supporting the Honor Flight
Kentucky program, Nolin RECC, under
Mickey’s leadership, along with other
Kentucky cooperatives, enabled 43
World War II, Korea, and Vietnam vet-
erans to travel to Washington, DC, last
year to see the memorials built to
honor their service. I am grateful for
the work of Honor Flight Kentucky,
which gives many veterans their only
chance to visit our Nation’s Capital,
and I applaud the efforts of community
leaders like Mickey for making these
trips a possibility for our heroes.
Given Mickey’s dedication to these
many causes and his passion for rural
communities, it is no wonder that he
has been honored with several awards
recognizing his service to many of
these organizations. From the Touch-
stone Energy Distinguished Service
Award to the Boy Scout Hardin County
Distinguished Citizen Award, Mickey is
widely praised for his professional ac-
complishments and his service to his
community.
Although I am sure everyone at
Nolin RECC is sorry to see him go, I
know they will join me in thanking
Mickey for his many years of dedicated
service to Kentucky’s rural commu-
nities. I wish him a relaxing retirement
with his wife of 46 years, Barbara, his
daughters, Jennifer and Carmen, and
his grandsons, Craig and Mason. I en-
courage my Senate colleagues to help
me congratulate Mickey Miller on a re-
markable career of service to Nolin
RECC.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO GAVIN GEE
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise
today to recognize Gavin Gee, director
of the Idaho Department of Finance,
who announced his retirement after
over four decades of distinguished serv-
ice to the State.
Gavin has led an impressive career in
the banking sector, dedicating the ma-
jority of his life to promoting access to
vigorous, healthy, and comprehensive
financial services for Idaho citizens. He
began his career at the Idaho Depart-
ment of Finance in 1977 and has served
as the department’s director since 1996
after a short stint as its acting director
in 1995. Impressively, in a post that re-
quires Gubernatorial appointment, as
well as the advice and consent of the
State senate, Gavin has served under
four different Governors.
Prior to being acting director, he
served the department in a number of
other roles, including as the depart-
ment’s deputy attorney general, securi-
ties bureau chief, and financial institu-
tions bureau chief. He also served as
chairman and a member of the State
Liaison Committee of the Federal Fi-
nancial Institutions Examination
Council between 1994 and 1999 and as
chairman and on the boards of direc-
tors of both the Conference of State
Bank Supervisors and the National As-
sociation of State Credit Union Super-
visors.
Throughout his career, Gavin has
fought to ensure the financial interests
of Idaho citizens are effectively served.
He has also championed policies and
enforced laws to protect Idaho’s citi-
zens from fraud, unsafe practices, and
unlawful conduct. He is a leading fig-
ure in community banking, widely re-
spected by those in the industry and
those with whom he works.
In addition to his service at the State
level, Gavin has contributed meaning-
fully to the national dialogue on finan-
cial services supervision and regula-
tion. He was instrumental in the devel-
opment of the Nationwide Mortgage Li-
censing System and Registry, improv-
ing supervision of the mortgage indus-
try and enhancing consumer protec-
tion. From 2006 to 2012, he served as
chairman of the CSBS/American Asso-
ciation of Residential Mortgage Regu-
lators State Regulatory Registry, the
board which oversees the development
and operation of the System. He has
worked closely with Congress on regu-
latory relief efforts, counseling law-
makers on the Financial Services Reg-
ulatory Relief Act of 2006 and then
again on the Economic Growth, Regu-
latory Relief and Consumer Protection
Act in 2018. On several occasions, Gavin
lent his expertise in testimony before
the Senate Banking Committee. We
have enjoyed a close working relation-
ship, and I am grateful for his willing-
ness to engage and educate lawmakers.
Gavin has been a real asset to the
State of Idaho and the Nation, and I
consider him a good friend. I appre-
ciate his lifetime of service and wish
him well in retirement.∑

INTRODUCTION OF POLICE
CAMERA ACT 1/3/19
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in support of the Police Creating Accountability
by Making Effective Recording Act, also
known as the Police CAMERA Act, a bill I in-
troduced today with several of my colleagues.
If enacted, this bill would establish a grant pro-
gram to assist state and local law enforcement
with the deployment of body-worn camera pro-
grams.
Safe communities require good police.
Good policing requires public trust.
Unfortunately, in far too many communities,
that trust has become strained.
In the wake of recent police shootings, our
nation is facing sobering questions about the
basic fairness of our criminal justice system.
We face sobering questions about race.
Over the past several years, the wider avail-
ability of video has shined a much-needed
light on police use of deadly force. Without
video of places like North Charleston, Staten
Island, Chicago, Cleveland, Baton Rouge,
Tulsa and Falcon Heights, Minnesota the
world might never know what occurred.
The more we see of these types of videos,
the more we are left to wonder about all the
incidents that were not recorded.
Had there been better video of the shooting
of Darrius Stewart in my home town of Mem-
phis, it might have helped to better inform the
grand jury that, sadly, refused to indict the po-
lice officer who was responsible.
Justice is supposed to be blind, but it is not
supposed to be blind to the facts.
Police body cameras can help provide evi-
dence and restore some much-needed trust.
They can protect both police and citizens
alike.
The vast majority of police are well mean-
ing, dedicated public servants, and we depend
upon them to keep us safe from criminals.
They have dangerous jobs, as we have seen
all too frequently.
But the fact remains some officers go be-
yond the law in a callous disregard for due
process. Their actions damage the public trust
that is essential for good police to be able to
serve and protect our communities.
Police body cameras, alone, won’t solve this
problem. But they are an important step in the
right direction.
I urge all members to help pass the Police
CAMERA Act quickly.

IN MEMORY OF MR. RALPH
WILLIAM HALL
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor a great soldier, dedicated
husband, loving father, and loyal friend to
many, Mr. Ralph William Hall. Sadly, Mr. Hall
passed away on December 18, 2018. His fu-
neral service will be held on January 5, 2019
at 11 am at St. Timothy Episcopal Church lo-
cated at 3601 Alabama Avenue SE, Wash-
ington, D.C. 20020.
Mr. Ralph William Hall was born on January
25, 1919, in Metcalf, Georgia to the union of
Adam and Maggie Franklin Hall. He was the
oldest of five children. At an early age, he
moved to Thomasville, Georgia where he lived
with his parents and maternal grandmother.
During this time, he learned to fish, hunt, and
perform farm chores. But, it was also during
this time that his unbreakable bond with God
was cemented. He joined St. Mark AME
Church and attended every Sunday. He also
attended Allen Normal School, a private Con-
gregational school where he learned self-dis-
cipline and bible study.
A diligent student, Ralph graduated from
Douglas High School, where he served as
Senior Class President. He went on to con-
tinue his education at Johnson C. Smith Uni-
versity in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he
earned a degree in Mathematics in 1941.
Ralph was drafted into the United States Army
while in college, but was allowed to complete
his degree requirements, then served faithfully
for five years. He was discharged in 1946. He
was initiated into the brotherhood of Omega
Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. and was a life member
for 80 years until his passing.
Following his discharge from the Army, his
life would change forever as he was joined in
holy matrimony with his college sweetheart,
Virginia (Ginny) Holder.
He moved his new family to Washington,
D.C. and embarked on a career with the Fed-
eral Government that lasted for 35 years. Dur-
ing this time, two children were born to this
union, Douglas and Angela.
Sadly, Ginny became ill and passed in
1962. Mr. Hall was then left with the awesome
task of being a single father. However, as with
other challenges in his life, he was more than
ready to meet this one. His strong and unwav-
ering faith in God led him to become a mem-
ber of the Jones United Methodist Church,
where he proudly served as Chairman of the
Trustee Board, where he led the completion of
the Education Building along with serving as
the Church School Superintendent.
Another major life changing event for him
occurred when he was introduced to Thelma
Johnson by a dear Army Buddy and his wife,
Milton and Evelyn Serailee. This led to their
marriage in 1965 and the new family moved to
Hillcrest area in Southeast Washington, D.C.
Ralph Hall continued his love for service to
humankind as a member of the Hillcrest Civic
Association and as PTA President at Anne
Beers Elementary School. In 1966, he and
Thelma joined St. Timothy’s Episcopal Church
where he served many roles to include: Lay
Reader, Diocensanis Delegate, Member of the
Men of St. Timothy’s (Most), and the Brother-
hood of St. Andrews. He truly dedicated his
life to the service of others. And was a con-
stant example of sincerity, loyalty, and devo-
tion to family.
Madam Speaker, my wife Vivian and I,
along with the 730,000 constituents of the
Second Congressional District of Georgia, sa-
lute and honor the life of Mr. Ralph William
Hall. I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join us in extending our deep-
est condolences to the Hall family during this
difficult time of bereavement. We pray that
that they will be consoled and comforted by an
abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days,
weeks and months ahead.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COMMIS-
SION TO STUDY REPARATION
PROPOSALS FOR AFRICAN-AMER-
ICAN ACT
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to re-introduce H.R. 40, the Commis-
sion to Study and Develop Reparation pro-
posals for African-Americans Act. This legisla-
tion was first introduced by retired Member of
Congress John Conyers of Michigan in 1989,
and was intended to examine the institution of
slavery in the colonies and the United States
from 1619 to the present, and further rec-
ommend appropriate remedies.
Since the initial introduction of this legisla-
tion, its proponents have made substantial
progress in elevating the discussion of repara-
tions and reparatory justice at the national
level and joining the mainstream international
debate on the issues. Though some have tried
to deflect the importance of these conversa-
tions by focusing on individual monetary com-
pensation, the real issue is whether and how
this nation can come to grips with the legacy
of slavery that still infects current society.
Through legislation, resolutions, news, and liti-
gation, we are moving closer to making more
strides in the movement toward reparations.
Today there are more people at the table—
more activists, more scholars, more CEO’s,
more state and local officials, and more Mem-
bers of Congress. However, despite this
progress and the election of the first American
President of African descent, the legacy of
slavery lingers heavily in this nation. While we
have focused on the social effects of slavery
and segregation, its continuing economic im-
plications remain largely ignored by main-
stream analysis. These economic issues are
the root cause of many critical issues in the
African-American community today, such as
education, healthcare and criminal justice pol-
icy, including policing practices. The call for
reparations represents a commitment to enter-
ing a constructive dialogue on the role of slav-
ery and racism in shaping present-day condi-
tions in our community and American society.
Over the last several years, we have had a
distinguished academic and activist panel from

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E2 January 3, 2019
the National African American Reparations
Commission dive into some of the most salient
points in the reparations discussion. I am sup-
porting this effort by continuing to hold the an-
nual reparations retrospective at the Annual
Legislative Conference of the Congressional
Black Caucus.
I believe that H.R. 40 is a crucial piece of
legislation because it goes beyond exploring
the economic implications of slavery and seg-
regation. It is a holistic bill in the sense that it
seeks to establish a commission to also exam-
ine the moral and social implications of slav-
ery. In short, the Commission aims to study
the impact of slavery and continuing discrimi-
nation against African-Americans, resulting di-
rectly and indirectly from slavery to segrega-
tion to the desegregation process and the
present day. The commission would also
make recommendations concerning any form
of apology and compensation to begin the
long delayed process of atonement for slav-
ery.
With the over criminalization and policing of
black bodies, a reoccurring issue in African-
American communities, I believe this con-
versation is both relevant and crucial to restor-
ing trust in governmental institutions in many
communities. As in years past, I welcome
open and constructive discourse on H.R. 40
and the creation of this commission in the
116th Congress. Though the times and cir-
cumstance may change, the principle problem
of slavery continues to weigh heavily on this
country. A federal commission can help us
reach into this dark past and bring us into a
brighter future.

INTRODUCTION OF THE POLICE
TRAINING AND INDEPENDENT
REVIEW ACT
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in support of the Police Training and Inde-
pendent Review Act, a bill I introduced today
with colleague LACY CLAY of Missouri.
If enacted, the Police Training and Inde-
pendent Review Act would help ensure the
independent investigation and prosecution of
law enforcement officers in cases involving
their use of deadly force. It would also help
ensure that law enforcement officers receive
appropriate training.
America received a wakeup call in Fer-
guson, Missouri. We received another in Stat-
en Island, New York.
We received yet another in Ohio, South
Carolina, Illinois, Minnesota, Louisiana and
Oklahoma.
Our nation faces sobering questions about
the basic fairness of our criminal justice sys-
tem. And we face sobering questions about
race. These questions simply cannot be ig-
nored.
For too many, for too long, justice has
seemed too lacking.
President Obama’s Commission on 21st
Century Policing suggested several common
sense reforms, including the use of inde-
pendent prosecutors for police-involved civilian
deaths, as well as additional training for law
enforcement officers.
Unfortunately, Congress has yet to act on
these recommendations.
We need to stop asking local prosecutors to
investigate the same law enforcement officers
with whom they work so closely, and whose
relationships they rely upon to perform their
daily responsibilities. Prosecutors also often
seek the support of their local police when
they run for reelection.
This is an inherent conflict of interest, and if
we are serious about restoring a sense of fair-
ness and justice, we must remove this conflict
immediately.
To be sure, the vast majority of prosecutors
and law enforcement officers are well mean-
ing, dedicated public servants, and we depend
upon them to keep us safe from criminals.
And they have dangerous jobs, as we have
seen all too frequently.
But the fact remains that some officers go
beyond the law in a callous disregard for due
process. When it comes to investigating, and
potentially prosecuting, these actions, there is
often a perception of unfairness, and that per-
ception poisons the public trust.
That is bad for law enforcement as well as
citizens, making their work more dangerous.
The Police Training and Independent Re-
view Act would give states an incentive to use
independent prosecutors when police use of
deadly force results in a civilian death. It
would also give states and incentive to provide
training to police to help them better under-
stand the racial and ethnic diversity of the
communities they serve, as well as how best
to work with individuals who are disabled or
mentally ill.
If states use independent prosecutors and
provide appropriate training, they would be-
come eligible for additional federal funding.
I urge my colleagues to help pass this legis-
lation quickly, and help restore some much
needed faith in our criminal justice system.
I want to thank my colleague, LACY CLAY for
his partnership on this bill. He is a tireless ad-
vocate on these issues, and I am honored to
work with him. I also want to thank Senator
TAMMY DUCKWORTH for her leadership on this
legislation, and look forward to her introducing
a Senate companion soon.

COMBATTING SEXUAL HARASS-
MENT IN SCIENCE ACT OF 2019
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today I am pleased to be joined by my good
friend, Ranking Member LUCAS, in introducing
the Combatting Sexual Harassment in Science
Act of 2019.
Over the last year, the #MeToo movement
emboldened countless women, many who had
remained silent for years, to share their expe-
riences. Their stories made it clear that the ex-
perience of sexual harassment is much too
common across all segments of our society. A
recent report by the National Academies of
Sciences revealed that sexual harassment is
pervasive in the scientific workplace—in lec-
ture halls, laboratories, observatories, and re-
mote field sites. The report also found that
sexual harassment stifles the advancement of
female scientists.
This bill establishes a research program at
the National Science Foundation to examine
the prevalence of and factors contributing to
sexual harassment in the scientific workforce.
Furthermore, this bill directs the Office of
Science and Technology Policy to issue uni-
form policy guidance to Federal science agen-
cies to ensure every agency has clear policies
and dedicated resources to prevent and re-
spond to incidents of sexual harassment at
academic institutions receiving federal re-
search funding. This legislation also creates
an interagency working group to improve co-
ordination and communication among agen-
cies in addressing sexual harassment by fed-
erally funded scientists.
Sexual harassment is driving some of our
brightest minds away from careers in research
at a time when we need them most. If we are
to tackle the scientific and technological chal-
lenges ahead of us, we must do more to en-
sure women are free to conduct their research
without being degraded, harassed, or abused
because of their gender. The Combatting Sex-
ual Harassment in Science Act of 2019 is an
important first step in that direction, and I hope
Members on both sides of the aisle will sup-
port this legislation.

REINTRODUCTION OF THE BUILD
AMERICA ACT
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce the Build America Act, leg-
islation that will provide $10 billion annually for
merit-based infrastructure grants across the
country. For years, House Democrats have
called for a dramatic investment in infrastruc-
ture, and for years, these call calls have gone
unanswered. I am hopeful that this will be the
year that we finally make the investments we
need. I am proud to offer my own legislation
today—not for a massive, all-encompassing
infrastructure package—but rather, for a com-
mon sense expansion of successful programs
based on need and merit that will ensure we
put money towards the greatest infrastructure
needs regardless of any additional package
passed in the House.
My legislation will significantly increase the
size and scope of two existing infrastructure
grant programs, the Capital Investment Grant
Program (CIG), also known as New Starts/
Small Starts, and the BUILD Grant Program,
formerly known as the Transportation Invest-
ment Generating Economic Recovery Grant
Program, or TIGER Grants. These programs
have been immensely successful in the past,
assisting rural and urban communities
prioritize their own needs. Each program re-
quires matching funds from those seeking as-
sistance, making them smart and effective
avenues for leveraging federal funding to
make a real impact across the country.
My bill takes these programs out of the an-
nual appropriations process. Instead, it estab-
lishes them as mandatory programs with per-
manent and expanded funding streams total-
ing more than $10 billion annually.
This expansion will be welcome news to the
thousands of communities like those I rep-
resent. Consider this, Madam Speaker: since

CORRECTION
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E3
January 3, 2019
2009, Congress has dedicated more than $5.1
billion for multiple rounds of TIGER funding. In
FY2015 alone, the program received $10.1 bil-
lion in applications. That’s twice the total
amount of funding over a 10 year period in
just a single fiscal year. The process is com-
petitive, and it allows the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) to reward applicants that
exceed eligibility criteria and demonstrate
commitments to their projects.
By increasing these funding levels and re-
moving the programs from the annual appro-
priations process, we will take the guesswork
and uncertainty out of the programs. This in
turn will allow communities around the country
to submit funding requests for projects of na-
tional, regional, or metropolitan-area signifi-
cance, including the construction and repair of
roads, bridges, and tunnels, the installation of
high speed internet, revitalization of drinking
water infrastructure, and the construction and
expansion of fixed-guideway public transpor-
tation systems, including subways, light rail,
commuter rail, and bus rapid transit (BRT).
Madam Speaker, we have talked about
prioritizing a large-scale infrastructure package
for years. Last Congress, Congressional
Democrats unveiled a trillion-dollar plan to
make these investments and create tens of
thousands of jobs. However, like so many
other proposals, it was rejected out of hand by
the Republican Majority. We need to get seri-
ous.
Every four years, the American Society of
Civil Engineers’ issues a ‘‘Report Card’’ for
America’s Infrastructure. The report depicts
the condition and performance of American in-
frastructure, assigning letter grades based on
the physical condition and needed investments
for improvement across 16 major infrastructure
categories. The most recent report card was
issued last two years ago. Among the national
rankings, transit systems were rated a D¥
and roads were rated a D.
Dams: D.
Drinking water: D.
Inland waterways: D.
Levees: D.
We need to move this process forward. I
urge my colleagues to consider my bill without
delay, so that our country can begin making
the investments it desperately needs.

INTRODUCTION OF THE STREAM-
LINED AND IMPROVED METHODS
AT POLLING LOCATIONS AND
EARLY VOTING ACT
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in support of the Streamlined and Improved
Methods at Polling Locations and Early Voting
Act, also known as the ‘‘SIMPLE’’ Voting Act
for short that I introduced today.
This is a scary time for voting rights. We are
witnessing an assault on voting rights the likes
of which our nation has not seen since the
passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The
President has alleged during the 2016 and
2018 election cycles, without evidence, that
there is widespread voter fraud in our country.
In the name of protecting Americans from
supposed in-person voter fraud—a fraud that
is virtually non-existent—states have been en-
acting voter ID laws. The real reason for these
laws, however, has been anything but election
integrity. It has been about partisan politics
and discrimination.
But don’t take my word for it. Take the
words of legislators like the then-Pennsylvania
House Majority Leader who boasted in 2012
that the state’s newly enacted voter ID law
would allow Mitt Romney to win his state.
While speaking about his legislature’s accom-
plishments, he said, ‘‘Voter ID, which is going
to allow Governor Romney to win the state of
Pennsylvania: done.’’
Or take the comments of a freshman Re-
publican Wisconsin state representative who,
while being interviewed ahead of the 2016
election, said, ‘‘And now we have photo ID,
and I think photo ID is going to make a little
bit of a difference as well.’’
Or take the word of the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the 4th Circuit which said that provi-
sions of a voter ID law in North Carolina ‘‘tar-
get African Americans with almost surgical
precision[.]’’ According to the court, the law
imposed cures for problems that did not exist,
and ‘‘thus the asserted justifications cannot
and do not conceal the State’s true motiva-
tion.’’
The right to vote is the cornerstone of our
democracy. It is sacred. Yet, sadly, we have
an ugly history in this nation of efforts to limit
people’s ability to access this constitutional
right.
We need to make it easier for people to
vote, not harder, and that is why I have intro-
duced this bill today.
If enacted, the SIMPLE Voting Act would re-
quire states to allow early voting for federal
elections for at least two weeks prior to elec-
tion day, and to the greatest extent possible
ensure that polling locations are within walking
distance of a stop on a public transportation
route.
It would also require that sufficient voting
systems, poll workers and other election re-
sources are provided, that wait times are fair
and equitable for all voters across a state, and
that no one be required to wait longer than
one hour to cast a ballot at a polling place.
None of this should be controversial. This is
all common sense, or at least should be, to
those who to want help more Americans to
vote.
I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. PAUL
STEWART
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of Paul Stewart as he is in-
ducted by the USA Hockey Association into
the USA Hockey Hall of Fame.
Mr. Stewart was born and raised in Dor-
chester, Massachusetts, where he got his first
pair of skates at age six, after borrowing his
sister’s figure skates too many times. He rose
to playing in the National Hockey League for
the Quebec Nordiques.
Transitioning from a career playing in the
NHL to paving the way for American referees,
Mr. Stewart became the first American to both
play and officiate in the National Hockey
League. Following in the footsteps of his fa-
ther and grandfather, he officiated his first
game on March 27, 1986 in his hometown
rink, the Boston Garden.
Players respected him, as he had a great
respect for the players. He set an example for
the future of NHL officiating and a new path-
way for future referees. A testament to his
strength and commitment came in the middle
of his career, when he beat cancer and was
back officiating within a year of his diagnosis.
Outside of the regular season, Mr. Stewart of-
ficiated 49 Stanley Cup playoff games and two
NHL All-Star games.
In 2003, Mr. Stewart became the first Amer-
ican born referee to officiate 1,000 NHL reg-
ular-season games. He finished out officiating
his 1,010th and final game right where it all
started, at home in Boston surrounded by fam-
ily and friends.
After his trailblazing career on the ice, Mr.
Stewart served as an ambassador for the
NHL’s Hockey Fights Cancer campaign. He
also went on to be the director of the Bill
Stewart Foundation, raising money for inner
city youth sports, and the ECAC director of of-
ficiating, now working to break down barriers
for women in the NHL. Following in the family
profession, his two sons, McCauley and Max-
well, are both officiating hockey.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Mr.
Paul Stewart for his trailblazing efforts that
have changed the future of the sport, and who
now joins his grandfather in the USA Hockey
Hall of Fame. I ask that my colleagues join me
in recognizing his hard work and dedication.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF RE-
TIRED MISSISSIPPI JUDGE JOHN
ANDREW HATCHER, JR.
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize the retirement of one
of Mississippi’s most devoted citizens and
public servants, the Honorable Judge John
Andrew Hatcher, Jr. Judge Hatcher, a native
of Sunflower, Mississippi, is retiring after a
long and distinguished career.
Upon graduation from Drew High School in
1966, Judge Hatcher continued his education
at Delta State University. After graduating in
1969, he attended the University of Mississippi
School of Law where he received his Juris
Doctorate. This began Judge Hatcher’s impec-
cable legal career.
Judge Hatcher began practicing law in
Booneville, Mississippi, in November 1973. He
also took up teaching as he taught a paralegal
program at Northeast Mississippi Community
College. This led to a passion advocating for
public service. Judge Hatcher served as the
vice chairman of the Mississippi Council on
Children from 1977 to 1979, the Housing Spe-
cialist with the Governor’s Office of Federal,
State and Local Programs, Division of Housing
Coordinator from 1978 to 1979 and the Direc-
tor of Yocona Area Council of Boy Scouts of
America from 1979 to 1980.
Judge Hatcher went on to serve as the

INTRODUCTION OF NATIONAL STA-
TISTICS ON DEADLY FORCE
TRANSPARENCY ACT
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, the fact that
after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson,
the Eric Garner killing in Staten Island, and so
many other, similar tragic events around the
country, we still don’t have reliable statistics
about when, where and against whom law en-
forcement uses deadly force is shameful.
Even former FBI Director James Comey has
said it is ‘‘ridiculous that [he] can’t tell you how
many people were shot by the police last
week, last month, last year.’’
If we are serious about addressing exces-
sive force, we need to know the full scope of
the problem. For example, how often is deadly
force used? Are minorities disproportionately
the victims? Could other, non-lethal measures
have been taken?
That is why today I am introducing the Na-
tional Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency
Act. It would require collection of this type of
information. Although a provision of the 1994
Crime Bill requires the Attorney General to
collect statistics on the use of excessive force,
there is no enforcement mechanism and the
federal government has been unable to gather
data from many local police departments.
Since excessive force can be difficult to de-
fine, this bill would be limited to just instances
where deadly force is used.
Specifically, this legislation would require
any law enforcement agency receiving federal
funds to provide data to the Department of
Justice on when each instance of deadly force
occurred, including the race and gender of
both the victim and the officer involved. It
would also require an explanation as to why
law enforcement felt deadly force was justified
and any non-lethal efforts that were taken be-
fore deadly force was used.
The Department of Justice would make this
data publicly available but would not disclose
any personally identifying information.
This is information the public should already
have. The fact we don’t is absurd. I urge my
colleagues to fix this problem and pass the
National Statistics on Deadly Force Trans-
parency Act without delay.

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR VALARIE
GANDY
HON. MARC A. VEASEY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, our men
and women in uniform sacrifice to keep our
nation strong and free. They are well-trained,
extraordinarily capable and are some of our
country’s best and brightest. Among their
ranks is Major Valarie Gandy, who I want to
help recognize today for her service to the
U.S. Army Reserve and Congress.
Major Valarie Gandy, from Sylacauga, Ala-
bama, was selected for the Army’s Congres-
sional Fellowship Program in 2015. She
served as a Defense Fellow in my office from
January to December 2016. I, along with my
staff, greatly benefitted from her expertise, as-
sistance, and advisement during the year-long
assignment. During that time, Major Gandy
became a valuable member of my team and
earned my confidence to serve as my Military
Legislative Assistant.
She served as an advisor on all matters re-
lating to defense, intelligence and veteran af-
fairs. She researched and drafted multiple
pieces of legislation introduced to Congress,
including a provision on equal survivor bene-
fits for Reserve and National Guard members
in the 2017 National Defense Authorization
Act.
After her time in my office, Major Gandy be-
came a legislative liaison for the Office of the
Chief of Army Reserve (OCAR) Legislative Af-
fairs Division, where she oversaw the military
personnel, civilian employee and medical port-
folios.
Major Gandy facilitated my visit to the Army
Reserve Center in Grand Prairie, Texas in
2018. Due to her outreach efforts and effective
communication, she became a heavily relied
upon resource for congressional offices. For
her congressional contributions and efforts,
she has been recognized by veterans and
military support organizations.
Our military personnel do not shoulder the
stress and sacrifice of military service alone,
and Major Gandy is no exception. Her hus-
band of 17-years, Raphael, sons, Ty and Alex,
and daughter, Blayze, have stood proudly by
her side, sacrificing time with their wife and
mother while she fulfilled her military commit-
ments. To them also, we offer a truly heartfelt
thank you.
I proudly recognize Major Valarie Gandy’s
years of service to our nation.
INTRODUCTION OF THE FRESH
START ACT
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the Fresh Start Act, a bill I introduced
today.
If enacted, it would allow certain individuals
who have been convicted of nonviolent of-
fenses, paid their debt to society, and are now
law-abiding members of the community to pe-
tition courts to have their nonviolent conviction
expunged from their records.
A criminal record, even for a minor, non-
violent offense, can pose as a barrier to em-
ployment, education and housing opportuni-
ties—the very things necessary to start one’s
life over.
This is not only bad for rehabilitated offend-
ers, it is bad for their families and for the com-
munities in which they live.
The Fresh Start Act would give nonviolent
offenders a chance to start over again, a
chance to become productive members of so-
ciety.
The bill allows offenders to apply for
expungement to the court where they were
sentenced and allows the United States Attor-
ney for that district to submit recommenda-
tions to the court. Applicants who are denied
could reapply once every two years. Once
seven years have elapsed since an offender
has completed their sentence, expungement
would be automatically granted. However, sex
offenders and those who commit crimes caus-
ing a loss of over $25,000 would not be eligi-
ble for automatic expungement.
Finally, the bill would also encourage states
to pass their own expungement laws for state
offenses. States that pass a substantially simi-
lar law would receive a 5 percent increase in
their Byrne Justice Assistance Grant funding
while those that do not would lose 5 percent
of their Byrne funds.
It is one thing to convict someone of a non-
violent crime. It is quite another to condemn
him to a de facto life sentence for it.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DEMOC-
RACY RESTORATION ACT OF 2019
HON. JERROLD NADLER
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to introduce the Democracy Restora-
tion Act of 2019. This legislation will serve to
clarify and, in some cases, expand the voting
rights of people with felony convictions, the
next logical step in restoring their full participa-
tion in civic life.
The United States remains one of the
world’s strictest nations when it comes to de-
nying the right to vote to citizens convicted of
crimes. An estimated 6.1 million citizens are
ineligible to vote in federal elections due to
their status as ex-offenders. More than four
and a half million of these disqualified voters
are not in prison, but are on probation, parole,
or have completed their sentence. Due to dif-
ferences in state laws and rates of criminal

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E5

punishment, states vary widely in the practice
of disenfranchisement, demonstrating a critical
federal interest for uniform standards.
Clarification of the law on restoration of ex-
offender voting rights is a critical next step in
criminal justice reform. In 2007, President
George W. Bush signed the Second Chance
Act into law, signaling a bipartisan awareness
of the importance of enacting policies that as-
sist in the reintegration of ex-offenders into
their communities. Recent public opinion re-
search has also shown that a significant ma-
jority of Americans favor voting rights for peo-
ple on probation or parole, who are currently
supervised in their communities, as well as for
individuals who have completed their sen-
tences. This legislation both captures the bi-
partisan spirit of the Bush administration and
is consistent with evolving public opinion on
rehabilitation of ex-offenders.
From a constitutional basis, the Democracy
Restoration Act is a narrowly crafted effort to
expand voting rights for people with felony
convictions, while protecting state prerogatives
to generally establish voting qualifications. The
legislation would only apply to persons who
are not in prison, and would only apply to fed-
eral elections. As such, our bill is fully con-
sistent with constitutional requirements estab-
lished by the Supreme Court in a series of de-
cisions upholding federal voting rights laws.
Since the initial introduction of this legisla-
tion, the Sentencing Project reports 27 states
have amended felony disenfranchisement poli-
cies in an effort to reduce their restrictiveness
and expand voter eligibility. These reforms
have resulted in an estimated more than
800,000 citizens regaining their voting rights.
Yet, despite these reforms, the overall rate of
ex-offender disenfranchisement has not
abated and continues to have a dispropor-
tionate impact on communities of color. Many
of the state reforms still rely on lengthy waiting
periods or clemency and several feature bur-
densome procedural hurdles that have proven
difficult to navigate for persons seeking to re-
store their voting rights. As a result, approxi-
mately 50 percent of the entire
disenfranchised population is clustered in 12
states, with Florida alone accounting for 48
percent of the post-sentence population.
Proponents of ex-offender disenfranchise-
ment have offered few justifications for con-
tinuing the practice. In fact, the strongest em-
pirical research suggests that prohibitions on
the right to vote undermine both our voting
system and the fundamental rights of people
with felony convictions. A series of studies
make clear that civic engagement is pivotal in
the transition from incarceration and discour-
aging repeat offenses. Disenfranchisement
laws only serve to isolate and alienate ex-of-
fenders, creating additional obstacles in their
attempt to successfully put the past behind
them by fully reintegrating into society. Unfor-
tunately that is only half the story.
The current patchwork of state laws has
created widespread confusion among election
officials throughout the country and served as
the justification for flawed voter purges. For
example, although people with misdemeanor
convictions never lose the right to vote in
Ohio, in 2008, 30 percent of election officials
in the state responded incorrectly or ex-
pressed uncertainty about whether individuals
with misdemeanor convictions could vote. A
similar survey by the Nebraska ACLU in ad-
vance of the 2016 general election determined
that about half of state election officials gave
out the wrong information about former felons
voting rights. Given the general confusion by
election officials on restoration of voting rights,
many ex-offenders are hesitant to even at-
tempt registration, depriving eligible voters of
their rights. Only federal law can conclusively
resolve the ambiguities in this area plaguing
our voting system.
In past Congresses, voting restoration legis-
lation has been supported by a broad coalition
of groups interested in voting and civil rights,
including the NAACP, ACLU, Human Rights
Watch, the Brennan Center for Justice, and
the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights,
among many others. This coalition has ex-
panded to include many law enforcement
groups including the American Probation and
Parole Association, the Association of Paroling
Authorities International, and the National
Black Police Association, among others, who
recognize that allowing people to vote after re-
lease from prison helps rebuild ties to the
community that motivate law-abiding behavior.
The denial of voting rights by many states to
ex-offenders represents a vestige from a time
when suffrage was denied to whole classes of
our population based on race, gender, religion,
national origin and property. I believe that our
nation fails not only people with felony convic-
tions by denying them the right to vote, but the
rest of our society that has struggled through-
out its history to ensure that its citizenry be
part of legitimate and inclusive elections. It is
long overdue that these restrictions be rel-
egated to unenlightened history.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND
LEGACY OF MR. PAUL ELIZONDO
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the life and legacy of
Mr. Paul Elizondo, who passed away on De-
cember 27, 2018. Mr. Elizondo was a fellow
San Antonio resident and public servant who
dedicated his life to others. He is survived by
his wife, Irene, 3 sons and 3 granddaughters.
He will be greatly missed.
Mr. Elizondo studied Music Education at St.
Mary’s University. In 1957, he joined the
United States Marine Corps and served 2
years. A skilled saxophone player, he carried
an appreciation for music throughout his life.
For 14 years, Mr. Elizondo taught music at the
San Antonio and Edgewood Independent
School Districts. He was Director of the Paul
Elizondo Orchestra for 50 years. His orchestra
was enjoyed by the community for many
years.
Mr. Elizondo was a meaningful force for
progress in our community. In 1978, Mr.
Elizondo was elected to the Texas House of
Representatives where he served two terms
and was a member of the House Committee
on State Affairs and the House Committee on
Public Education. In 1982, he was first elected
to the Bexar County Commissioners Court,
later being elected to serve an unprecedented
10th term as Commissioner for Precinct 2,
making him the longest serving member of the
five-person Commissioners Court.
Mr. Elizondo was known as a no-nonsnse
individual whose commitment to policy was
only matched by his strong sense of humor.
He led incremental health care and criminal
justice programs. He was strong advocate for
mental health services throughout the county.
He was instrumental in major infrastructure
and safety projects such as the Bexar County
flood control program. Mr. Elizondo’s presence
in the community extended beyond the Court.
Notably, he assisted in bringing critical devel-
opment to the Westside of San Antonio.
To many, Mr. Elizondo was considered a
mentor who dedicated over 30 years to public
service. His institutional recollection of many
county matters will be sorely missed. Bexar
County was well served by Commissioner
Paul Elizondo.
I am proud to have known this great indi-
vidual. The passing of Mr. Paul Elizondo has
been greatly felt throughout our community.
However, I am confident that his impact will
last for many years to come.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NEWBORN
ACT
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in support of the Nationally Enhancing the
Wellbeing of Babies through Outreach and
Research Now (NEWBORN) Act, a bill I intro-
duced today.
In 2016, Tennessee had almost 600 chil-
dren die before their first birthday, including
over 120 in Shelby County. Shelby County’s
infant mortality rate was 9.3 per 1,000 live
births, which was a 13 percent increase over
2015 and significantly higher than both Ten-
nessee’s rate of 7.4 percent and the national
rate of 5.9 percent.
In the United States, our infant mortality rate
is comparable to countries like Bosnia, Chile,
and Cuba, and an American child is 76 per-
cent more likely to die before their first birth-
day in America than in 19 other wealthy na-
tions, including Australia, Canada, France,
Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
Even more concerning is the racial and eth-
nic infant mortality disparities that continue to
exist. In 2016, the rates for infant mortality
was nearly double for African American infants
compared to white infants in Tennessee.
This is unacceptable. That’s why I am intro-
ducing the NEWBORN Act.
If enacted, the NEWBORN Act would create
infant mortality-focused pilot programs in the
highest-risk areas of the country.
The pilot programs would focus on address-
ing one or more of the top five reasons for in-
fant mortality: birth defects, preterm birth and
low birth weight, sudden infant death syn-
drome, maternal pregnancy complications, and
injuries to the infant.
The NEWBORN Act would specifically en-
courage the development of community-spe-
cific practices to promote pre-natal care and
community outreach and education.
The current infant mortality rates are tragic,
but good practices can improve health and
save lives.
I urge my colleagues to help pass this bill.

INTRODUCTION OF THE
WASHINGTON, D.C. ADMISSION ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to introduce the Washington, D.C. Admission
Act with 156 original cosponsors, a record
number. This is the most important bill I intro-
duce each Congress. District of Columbia resi-
dents have always been citizens of the United
States, ranking number one in federal taxes
per capita that support the federal govern-
ment, but are the only federal income tax-
paying Americans who do not have full and
equal citizenship rights. The denial of local
control of local matters and of equal represen-
tation in the Congress can be remedied only
by statehood.
Therefore, I am introducing the Washington,
D.C. Admission Act to create a state from es-
sentially the eight home-town wards of the
District. This 51st state, of course, would have
no jurisdiction over the federal enclave that
now consists of the Washington that Members
of Congress and visitors associate with the
capital of our country. The U.S. Capitol Com-
plex, the principal federal monuments, federal
buildings and grounds, the National Mall, the
White House, and other federal property here
would remain under federal jurisdiction. Our
bill provides that the State of Washington,
D.C. would be equal to the other 50 states in
all respects, as is always required, and that
the residents of Washington, D.C. would have
all the rights of citizenship, including two sen-
ators and, initially, one House member. The
District recognizes that it can enter the Union
only on an equal basis, and is prepared to do
so.
A substantially similar version of the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act was the first bill I
introduced after I was first sworn in as a Mem-
ber of Congress in the 102nd Congress in
1991. Our first try for statehood received sig-
nificant support in the House. In 1993, we got
the first and only vote on statehood for the
District, with nearly 60 percent of Democrats
and one Republican voting for the bill. The
Senate held a hearing on various approaches
to representation, but the committee of juris-
diction did not proceed further. In the 113th
Congress, our statehood bill got unprece-
dented momentum with the Senate’s first-ever
hearing on statehood, which was the first con-
gressional hearing held on statehood in more
than 20 years, since the House held its hear-
ing on statehood in 1993, and obtained a
record number of cosponsors in the House
and Senate, including then-Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid, as well as the other top
three Democratic leaders in the Senate. In ad-
dition, then-President Obama endorsed D.C.
statehood in a public forum before the state-
hood hearing was held. In the 115th Con-
gress, not only was there a record number of
original cosponsors in the House (116) and
Senate (18), but also a record number of co-
sponsors in the House (181) and Senate (30).
Statehood is the only solution for full and
equal citizenship rights for residents of the
District. To be content with less than state-
hood is to concede the equality of citizenship
that is the birthright of our residents as citi-
zens of the United States. That is a conces-
sion no American citizen has ever made, and
one that D.C. residents will not make as they
approach the 218th year in their fight for equal
treatment in their country. This bill reaffirms
our determination to obtain each and every
right enjoyed by citizens of the United States,
by becoming the 51st State in the Union.
Since the founding of the nation, District
residents have always carried all the obliga-
tions of citizenship, including serving in all of
the nation’s wars and payment of federal
taxes, all without voting representation on the
floor in either house of Congress or freedom
from congressional interference in purely local
matters.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.

IN MEMORY OF MRS. JOHNNIE LEE
BROWN COLLIER
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor a dedicated woman of
God, great wife, steadfast mother, and friend
of longstanding, Mrs. Johnnie Lee Brown Col-
lier. Sadly, Mrs. Collier passed away on De-
cember 27, 2018. Her funeral service will be
held on Thursday, January 3, 2019 at 11 am
at the Fourth Street Missionary Baptist Church
in Columbus, Georgia.
Mrs. Johnnie Lee Brown Collier was born on
October 22, 1926, in Columbus, Georgia to
the union of Cleola Daniel Brown and Daniel
Brown, Sr. She gave her life to Christ and was
baptized at an early age at Rosehill Memorial
Baptist Church. From that time on, God con-
tinued to be the center of her life until her
passing. She served as the Sunday School
Superintendent and Church Clerk at Rosehill
before moving her membership to the Fourth
Street Missionary Baptist Church in 1957. Her
first pastor at Fourth Street was the late Rev-
erend Henry Harris. Mrs. Collier paved the
way for others as she was the first Church
Secretary at Fourth Street. She was a natural
and gifted leader as she served in a variety of
leadership positions at Fourth Street to include
the Deacon’s Wives (she served as Chair-
person for two terms), Pi Com Community
Leader in Zebulon Community, Women’s Day
Speaker, 1961, Chairperson of Program and
Pastoral Relations Committee, and was the
Roast and Toast Honoree in 1996.
Mrs. Collier was the epitome of a great wife
and mother. She married the late Deacon
Samuel Lee Collier on April 26, 1950. God
blessed this union for 34 years until Deacon
Collier’s untimely death on May 27, 1984. Six
children were born to this union to include two
sets of twins out: Bernice Collier Collins, Ber-
nard Collier (deceased), Agnes Collier Averett,
Samuel Lee Collier, Jr., Michelle Collier
McLain, and Michael Collier. Fred Rogers
once said that, ‘‘It’s not so much what you
have in life that matters, It’s what we do with
what we have.’’ Mrs. Collier did a lot for others
with what she had. In addition to her own chil-
dren, she served as a mother figure to her sib-
lings and countless others she found in need
of guidance and a helping hand.
Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm
once said that, ‘‘Service is the rent that we
pay for the space that we occupy here on this
earth.’’ Mrs. Collier paid her rent and she paid
it well. She served in a variety of community
organizations to include: Electric City Chapter
482 of the Order of the Eastern Stars (Worthy
Matron), Spencer High Alumni (Class of
1943), and she was a Muscogee County
Board of Elections Voting Precinct Manager
and she traveled to various state conventions
to further her knowledge of the voting process.
She was also an entrepreneur and a photog-
rapher. Her professional career took her to the
Medical Center, the Area Mental Health Clinic,
and the Enrichment Services Program. Her
benevolence extended throughout the commu-
nity and she often used her influence and net-
working to help others to find gainful employ-
ment.
Madam Speaker, my wife Vivian and I,
along with the more than 730,000 constituents
of the Second Congressional District of Geor-
gia, salute and honor the life of Mrs. Johnnie
Lee Brown Collier. I ask my colleagues in the
House of Representatives to join us in extend-
ing our deepest condolences to Mrs. Collier’s
family during this time of bereavement. We
pray that they will be consoled and comforted
by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the
days, weeks and months ahead.

INTRODUCTION OF JOHN TANNER
FAIRNESS AND INDEPENDENCE
IN REDISTRICTING ACT
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the John Tanner Fairness and Inde-
pendence in Redistricting Act, a bill I intro-
duced today.
In most states, districts are drawn by the
state legislature, and as a result, whichever
party controls the state legislature ends up
drawing Congressional districts specifically de-
signed to maximize the number of Congres-
sional seats that party can win.
In other words, the elected officials choose
the voters, instead of the voters choosing the
elected officials.
If enacted, the John Tanner Fairness and
Independence in Redistricting Act would fix
this by requiring states to use bipartisan redis-
tricting commissions to draw maps. No single
party would get to control the process.
Historically, both parties have engaged in
gerrymandering to some extent or another.
But that does not make it right.
In a representative democracy, the people
need be able to freely and fairly choose their
elected representatives.
Unfortunately, that is not always happening.
This is not what the Founders envisioned.
They designed the House of Representatives
to be the Congressional chamber that most
accurately reflects the views of the people.
The failure of the House to more accurately
reflect the will of the electorate is a formula for
the electorate to lose faith in the institution. It
makes people cynical and discourages them
from participating.
We can do better.
A democracy is supposed to be marketplace
of ideas. The playing field is supposed to be
fair and competitive, not gerrymandered and
monopolized.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHIEF PETER
CARNES
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the retirement of Chief Peter
Carnes, the Chief of Police and Director of
Campus Safety at Stonehill College.
Chief Carnes has devoted his life to serving
and protecting the people and communities
across Massachusetts. He began his illus-
trious career with the Wenham Police Depart-
ment in 1973. Chief Carnes progressed
through the ranks, becoming Wenham’s chief
of police.
In 1995, Chief Carnes took on the task of
heading up Cape Cod’s third largest Police
Department as Yarmouth’s Chief of Police. He
brought considerable positive change to the
department during his time there. His citizen’s
police academy and Adopt-A-School programs
played an essential role in bringing together
the police department amd the community
through education. Beyond a career serving
others, Chief Carnes still calls Cape Cod
home, living in Yarmouth with his wife Karen
and their son.
Chief Carnes took up his current post as
Chief of Police and Director of Campus Safety
at Stonehill College in 2008. He has embraced
a proactive approach to safety and policing,
engaging with and learning from the commu-
nities he serves. Chief Carnes’ innovative ap-
proach to policing has continued to put him at
the forefront of his field.
Unrelenting in his commitment to advancing
the cause of policing and its principles, in ad-
dition to serving faithfully as Chief of Police at
the Wenham, Yarmouth, and Stonehill police
departments, Chief Carnes has led many of
Massachusetts’ most prodigious non-depart-
mental policing bodies. He served as the
President of the Massachusetts Chief’s of Po-
lice Association, The Essex County Chiefs of
Police Association and the Cape Cod Chiefs
Council. Chief Carnes’ preeminence has al-
lowed him to spread his community centered
brand of policing to departments across Mas-
sachusetts. He has repeatedly exemplified the
highest ideals of his profession throughout his
years of leadership.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Chief
Peter Carnes and his commitment to ensuring
the safety of our community. I ask that my col-
leagues join me in recognizing his hard work
and dedication as he celebrates his retire-
ment.

ENERGY AND WATER RESEARCH
INTEGRATION ACT OF 2019
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today I am introducing the Energy and Water
Research Integration Act of 2019.
I first want to thank my friend, Mr. LUCAS,
for joining me in introducing this legislation,
which calls attention to the critical link be-
tween energy and water and instructs the De-
partment of Energy to ensure due consider-
ation of water issues in its research, develop-
ment, and demonstration programs.
As we all know, especially those of us who
represent Texas, Oklahoma, and other south-
western and western states, water is a very
valuable and at times rare commodity now-
adays. We have experienced crippling
droughts in recent years, so it is vital that we
do as much as possible to use this commodity
wisely. However, not many people are aware
of the importance of water to energy genera-
tion and, similarly, the crucial role that energy
plays in the delivery of safe, sanitary water to
our constituents.
The Energy and Water Research Integration
Act is a proactive measure that takes into ac-
count recent studies produced by the Depart-
ment of Energy and the Electric Power Re-
search Institute, both of which have high-
lighted how closely connected energy produc-
tion and water usage are. This bill encourages
research into energy technologies that would
improve and minimize the use of water in en-
ergy production, and also establishes a mech-
anism for federal agencies to work with state
and local governments and other stakeholders
to advance our understanding of what is
known as the ‘‘energy-water nexus.’’ In addi-
tion, the bill requires a regularly updated stra-
tegic plan to guide these efforts. These provi-
sions are important, positive steps towards
using our limited resources in the most effi-
cient and effective way possible.
I would like to commend the Department of
Energy for taking substantive action on this
issue under the leadership of former Secretary
Moniz and more recently under Secretary
Perry. This bill will ensure that activities to ad-
dress the energy-water nexus remain a priority
within the Department, and provide additional
tools to better guide these efforts well into the
future.
The legislation Mr. LUCAS and I are intro-
ducing is a constructive, bipartisan measure
and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.
Working together, I hope that we can dem-
onstrate a strong, sustained commitment to re-
search and development in this vital area.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPAS-
SIONATE ACCESS, RESEARCH EX-
PANSION AND RESPECT STATES
(CARERS) ACT
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to introduce the Compassionate Access, Re-
search Expansion and Respect States Act,
also known as the CARERS Act. This bipar-
tisan bill would allow states to set their own
policies on medical marijuana, allow states to
import cannabidiol to treat patients with sei-
zures, give the Veterans Administration physi-
cians the ability to recommend medical mari-
juana to patients and improve opportunities for
research on marijuana.
The consensus on medical marijuana is al-
ready overwhelming and continues to build.
According to a Quinnipiac University poll, 93
percent of Americans believe people should
be allowed to use medically prescribed mari-
juana.
93 percent of Americans rarely agree on
anything.
In November, Missouri and Utah joined a
growing majority of states that have legalized
medical marijuana. Thirty-two states plus the
District of Columbia have approved medical
marijuana.
Yet, our federal laws continue to treat pa-
tients and the doctors and families who care
for them like criminals.
It is long overdue for our federal law to re-
flect the common sense views of 93 percent of
Americans and stop adding to the suffering of
those with horrible illnesses.
One such patient was my constituent, Chloe
Grauer. At 3 years old, Chloe suffered from a
rare neurological disease that caused her to
have 100 to 200 seizures a day. She tried
dozens of medications and underwent surgical
procedures but nothing stopped the seizures.
Her family tried desperately to treat her with
cannabidiol—also known as ‘‘Charlotte’s Web’’
or ‘‘CBD’’ for short—which has been shown to
treat certain diseases that cause seizures,
such as the disease from which Chloe suf-
fered. CBD is derived from cannabis plants,
and even though it contains just trace
amounts of the psychoactive ingredient in
marijuana—nowhere near enough to produce
a high—but it is currently illegal under federal
law. Even this tiny amount of the ingredient,
THC, was enough for the federal government
to keep a potentially life-saving drug away
from Chloe.
Chloe died without receiving CBD.
This should never have happened. We must
ensure that this never happens again.
Just as our children deserve to be treated
compassionately, so, too, do our veterans.
Federal law currently prohibits VA doctors
from prescribing medical marijuana when they
feel it is medically beneficial. Our veterans de-
serve the best medical advice from their doc-
tors, not arbitrary limits on what their doctors
can do to help them. Veterans are tough.
They can handle frank advice from their doc-
tors.
I want to thank my colleague DON YOUNG of
Alaska, for his partnership on this bill as well
as Senator CORY BOOKER and the bipartisan
coalition he is leading in the Senate on these
issues. I urge both the House and Senate to
pass this swiftly.

Columbia River In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Ac-
cess Sites along the Columbia River.
This legislation calls for the Bureau of lndian
Affairs (BIA) to conduct a much-needed as-
sessment of current conditions at the In-Lieu
and Treaty Fishing Access sites under BIA
ownership on both sides of the Columbia, in
coordination with the four Columbia River trea-
ty tribes: the Warm Springs, Umatilla, Nez
Perce, and Yakama Nation. It authorizes the
BIA to improve existing federal structures and
infrastructure, improve sanitation and safety
conditions, and increase access to electricity,
sewer, and water infrastructure. BIA may con-
tract with tribes and tribal organizations to
conduct this important work that will lay a crit-
ical foundation for the construction of perma-
nent tribal housing.
Congress must do more to help members of
these four tribes who reside here after being
displaced by decades ago by the construction
of the Columbia River Dams and who never
received the permanent replacement housing
that was promised to them by the federal gov-
ernment. Those tribes have a treaty-protected
right to fish along the river at their usual and
accustomed places that must be respected.
I will continue to work with federal partners
and tribal nations to see that the need for
more permanent housing is fulfilled and tribal
member’s treaty rights are respected. In the
meantime, Congress must improve the living
conditions for the affected treaty tribe mem-
bers, and we must pass this bill.

INTRODUCTION OF CONSTITU-
TIONAL AMENDMENT TO ELIMI-
NATE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
AND PROVIDE FOR THE DIRECT
ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT
AND VICE PRESIDENT
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in support of a constitutional amendment I in-
troduced today to eliminate the electoral col-
lege and provide for the direct election of our
nation’s President and Vice President.
As Founding Father Thomas Jefferson said,
‘‘I am not an advocate for frequent changes in
laws and constitutions, but laws and institu-
tions must go hand in hand with the progress
of the human mind. As that becomes more de-
veloped, more enlightened, as new discov-
eries are made, new truths discovered and
manners and opinions change, with the
change of circumstances, institutions must ad-
vance also to keep pace with the times. We
might well as require a man to wear still the
coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized
society to remain ever under the regimen of
their barbarous ancestors.’’
In 2016, for the second time in recent mem-
ory, and for the fifth time in our history, the na-
tional popular vote winner did not become
President because of the Electoral College.
This has happened twice to candidates from
Tennessee: Al Gore and Andrew Jackson.
The reason is because the Electoral Col-
lege, established to prevent an uninformed
citizenry from directly electing our nation’s
President, no longer fits our nation’s needs.
When the Founders established the Elec-
toral College, it was in an era of limited nation-
wide communication. The electoral structure
was premised on a theory that citizens would
have a better chance of knowing about elec-
tors from their home states than about presi-
dential candidates from out-of-state. Electors
were supposed to be people of good judgment
who were trusted with picking a qualified
President and Vice President on behalf of the
people. They held the responsibility of choos-
ing a President because it was believed that
the general public could not be properly in-
formed of the candidates and the values each
held.
That notion—that citizens should be pre-
vented from directly electing the President—is
antithetical to our understanding of democracy
today, and our electoral process has not
evolved to match our abilities to communicate,
collect information, and make informed deci-
sions about candidates. The development of
mass media and the internet has made infor-
mation about presidential candidates easily
accessible to U.S. citizens across the country
and around the world. The people no longer
need the buffer of the electoral college to be
knowledgeable about and decide who will be
president. Today, citizens have a far better
chance of knowing about out-of-state presi-
dential candidates than knowing about presi-
dential electors from their home states. Most
people do not even know who their electors
are.
While our ability to communicate has
evolved so has the Electoral College, but not
in a positive way. Electors are now little more
than rubber stamps who are chosen based on
their political parties and who represent the in-
terests of those political parties, rather than
representing the people. Most states legally
bind their electors to vote for whomever wins
that state’s popular vote, so electors can no
longer exercise individual judgment when se-
lecting a candidate.
In our country, ‘‘We the People,’’ are sup-
posed to determine who represents us in elec-
tive office. Yet, we use an anachronistic proc-
ess for choosing who will hold the highest of-
fices in the land.
It is time for us to fix this, and that is why
I have introduced this amendment today.
Since our nation first adopted our Constitu-
tion, ‘‘We the People,’’ have amended it re-
peatedly to expand the opportunity for citizens
to directly elect our leaders:
The 15th Amendment guarantees the right
of all citizens to vote, regardless of race.
The l9th Amendment guarantees the right of
all citizens to vote, regardless of gender.
The 26th Amendment guarantees the right
of all citizens 18 years of age and older to
vote.
And the 17th Amendment empowers citi-
zens to directly elect U.S. Senators.
We need to amend our Constitution to em-
power citizens to directly elect the President
and the Vice President of the United States.
Working together, I know we can make our
Constitution better reflect the ‘‘more perfect
Union’’ to which it aspires.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 110TH
BIRTHDAY OF IRENE MILLER
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of Mrs. Irene Miller she who
turned 110 years young on December 28,
2018.
Mrs. Miller has been a lifelong resident of
New Bedford, Massachusetts. When asked
about her growing up, she reminisced about
her favorite childhood activities, sliding down
Weld Street whenever it snowed and playing
hopscotch. She married her first boyfriend and
together they celebrated over fifty years of
marriage. They went on to have two children,
Paul and Marcia, and a continually growing
family. Mrs. Miller now lives with her grand-
son.
Born in 1908, Mrs. Miller has lived through
countless historical events, including eight of
the nine World Series victories of her beloved
Red Sox. In her free time, she loves to read
and is described by friends as an absolute joy
who brings happiness to everyone around her.
She is known as ‘‘everyone’s grandma,’’ treat-
ing all her friends like family, and for her witti-
ness, humor, and laughter.
To celebrate her 110th birthday, she wishes
for everyone to be happy, which is how she
lives each day. We could all benefit by learn-
ing from Mrs. Miller’s approach to life.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Irene
Miller for a lifetime spent making her commu-
nity a better place. I ask that my colleagues
join me in wishing her a happy birthday and
many more years of health and happiness.

Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize the retirement of
Judge Charlie Brett. Judge Brett, a native of
Lee County, Mississippi, is retiring after a long
and distinguished career.
Upon graduation from Kosciusko High
School, Judge Brett attended Mississippi State
University where he graduated in 1968. Fol-
lowing his graduation, Judge Brett answered
the call to serve his country and joined the
United States Army where he served from
1969 to 1971. He then attended the University
of Mississippi Law School where he earned
his Juris Doctorate. During Judge Brett’s time
at law school he received several honors and
served on the Moot Court Board.
This was the beginning of Judge Brett’s long
career. He served four years as the Pros-
ecutor for the City of Tupelo and fourteen
years as Lee County Prosecuting Attorney and
Youth Court Prosecutor. Judge Brett has

served sixteen plus years as County Court
Judge and Youth Court Judge and retired as
the longest serving County Court Judge in Lee
County, Mississippi.
Judge Brett also served six years on the
Mississippi Judicial Performance Commission
and has been the Secretary of the Mississippi
County Court and Youth Court Judges Con-
ference for twelve years.
Judge Brett’s love for his country and com-
munity is evident but falls short of his love for
his family. He is married to Vicky Brett and the
father of four daughters, Melanie, Jennifer,
Lindsay, and Kayty. He is also the grandfather
of seven grandchildren and the great grand-
father of three great grandchildren.
Judge Brett is also very involved in his com-
munity outside of the court room. He is a
member of the Community Development
Foundation, and avid hunter, sportsman and
target shooter and strongly supports many
youth and conservations groups including the
Boy Scouts, National Wild Turkey Federation,
Jakes Program, and the NRA.
Judge Brett has selflessly served the people
of Mississippi for more than thirty years. His
devotion to God, America and his fellow man
will always be remembered, and I wish him
and his family many years of happiness.

Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the life and memory of
Mr. Ellis Collins, Jr., affectionately known
among family and friends as ‘‘Toby.’’ Born on
July 2, 1973, to parents Emma J. Collins and
Ellis Collins, Sr., Toby lived a remarkable life
dedicated to his country and his education. He
enlisted in the United States Air Force at the
age of 18, receiving several accolades
throughout his service, including the Air Force
Training Ribbon, the National Defense Service
Medal, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award,
and the Air Force Good Conduct Medal. Upon
completing his military duties, he enrolled at
Southern University & A&M College in Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, and earned a bacca-
laureate degree in Computer Science. He con-
tinued his studies at Louisiana State University
and earned a Master’s of Business Adminis-
tration in December 2013. Toby’s service to
his country and commitment to bettering him-
self and those around him is an inspiration to
us all. He was a beloved friend, son, student,
and patriot. He will be dearly missed.
INTRODUCTION OF CONSTITU-
TIONAL AMENDMENT TO LIMIT
THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, January 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in support of a constitutional amendment I in-
troduced today with several of my colleagues
to prevent the President of the United States
from pardoning himself, members of his fam-
ily, members of his administration or members
of his presidential campaign.
The pardon power is supposed to be a safe-
ty valve against injustice. It is not supposed to
be a way for presidents to put themselves,
their families and members of their administra-
tion above the law.
Unless we change the Constitution, how-
ever, this is how it could be used.
There are already serious questions swirling
around the current President, his family and
members of his administration—including pos-
sible collusion with Russia during the 2016
presidential election, which is currently being
investigated by Special Counsel Robert
Mueller.
To ensure that everyone is treated equally
under the law, we need to amend the Con-
stitution to narrow the scope of the pardon
power.
I urge my colleagues to pass this amend-
ment without delay.
