CONGRATULATING DAVID MINGUS
ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM
MAYOR OF EAST PEORIA
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize David Mingus for his retirement
from the position of mayor in East Peoria, Illi-
nois. Mayor Mingus has served as the mayor
of East Peoria for 12 years.
Mayor Mingus’ retirement from this position
brings to an end a long chapter in his out-
standing career in public service. As a certified
counselor and social worker, Mayor Mingus
has used his knowledge and expertise to bet-
ter the East Peoria community. In addition to
serving as the city’s mayor, Mayor Mingus
spent three terms on the City Council and
served on the local School Board. Serving his
community has always been a passion of
Mayor Mingus’ ever since he earned a mas-
ter’s degree in counseling and human devel-
opment, and went on to begin a career in the
mental health field. He served as director of
Neighborhood House in Peoria, as well as
CEO of the Tazwood Mental Health Board. I
commend Mayor Mingus for all of his efforts to
better the community of East Peoria and wish
him well as he takes on new professional op-
portunities in his career.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
David Mingus that I am especially proud to
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District.
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally
congratulate David Mingus on his retirement
as mayor and thank him for his service to the
community.

HONORING TWENTY-TWO TEACH-
ERS OF THE GREATER BOCA
RATON AREA
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of the twenty-two outstanding teach-
ers in South Florida who have been awarded
the Teacher of the Year award from the Ro-
tary Club of Boca Raton Sunrise.
For the past 33 years, the Rotary Club of
Boca Raton Sunrise has offered this annual
distinction to one teacher at each of the twen-
ty-two schools in the greater Boca Raton area.
Each awardee is selected by the school’s prin-
cipal. These teachers have dedicated their
time to inspiring, empowering, and bettering
the next generation of youth in our community.
Their passion in this effort is truly worthy of
our recognition.
These twenty-two exemplary teachers have
made a profound impact on their students
through their caring, commitment, and profes-
sionalism. They are a cohort defined by integ-
rity, excellence, and the highest marks in all
they do. The City of Boca Raton is fortunate
to have such outstanding faculty.
Congratulations to Jennifer O’Sullivan,
James Wade, Theo Wiles, Mary Donnelly,
Sarah Call, Scott Johnson, Mary Cavaioi, Lau-
rel Cash, Mary Giddings, Sunshine Grunstein,
Kimberly Attias, Scott Fontaine, Susan
Kinderman, Richard Andreacchio, Bogdan
Paraschivoiu, Kathleen Kaminsky, Kevin
McEnroe, Joann Tatham, Anna Lombado,
Catrina D’Annunzio, Jennifer Napuli, and Me-
lissa Romero on being nominated for this
year’s teacher of the year award.
I am pleased to honor them, and I thank
them for their continued service.

RECOGNIZING COLONEL DELWYN
SEVERIO MERKERSON
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, our brave
men and women of the Armed Forces continu-
ously make sacrifices to keep our nation
strong and free. Among the ranks is Colonel
Delwyn Severio Merkerson, who I want to rec-
ognize today for his 30 years of service in the
United States Army and the United States
Army Reserve.
General Colin Powell once stated, ‘‘Success
is the result of perfection, hard work, learning
from failure, loyalty and persistence.’’ Colonel
Merkerson’s military service is a shining exam-
ple of success at its finest. He made numer-
ous substantial and lasting contributions to the
quality, effectiveness, and readiness of the
United States Army and the United States
Army Reserve at operational and strategic lev-
els.
Colonel Merkerson served in various posi-
tions over his 30-year career, as an artillery
officer, budget officer, Deputy J–1 during a de-
ployment in Afghanistan, Battalion Com-
mander, Deputy Director for Reserve Compo-
nent Policy, and finally as Deputy Chief of
Staff, G–1. Colonel Merkerson’s entire career
was characterized by strong leadership, reso-
lute mission-focus for achieving intrinsic excel-
lence, and a genuine commitment to the wel-
fare of soldiers, civilians, and families. He
served as a model to the many who served
with him and is nothing short of a trans-
formational leader.
The cost of freedom is always high. How-
ever, our military personnel do not shoulder
the stress and sacrifice of military service
alone. The backbone of their commitment lies
with their families. Colonel Merkerson’s wife
Noel, sons Delwyn Jr., Kolby, Kaden and Staff
Sergeant Daven Gates and daughters Raisha
and Private Deja McCree have stood proudly
by his side throughout the years. To them
also, we offer a warm and heartfelt thank you.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I ask
the House of Representatives to join me in
recognizing Colonel Delwyn Merkerson.
HONORING BETH KILLIAN FOR
HER SERVICE TO SYRACUSE
MEALS ON WHEELS
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Beth Killian’s dedicated involvement
with Meals on Wheels Syracuse. Throughout
her nine years with the organization, Ms. Kil-
lian has worked as both a volunteer and treas-
urer, playing an integral role in updating and
managing the organization’s records.
Meals on Wheels Syracuse is an important
part of our Central New York community, pro-
viding home delivery food service to seniors
throughout the region. Volunteers like Ms. Kil-
lian are the foundation of Meals on Wheels
Syracuse, and are a vital part of delivering
healthy meals, nutrition education, and re-
source assistance to the most vulnerable
members of our community.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
House to join me in honoring Beth Killian and
her philanthropic spirit. Through Ms. Killian’s
involvement with Meals on Wheels Syracuse,
senior citizens in Central New York have the
ability to continue living independent lives
while not having to worry about their next
meal. Ms. Killian’s service has contributed to a
better Central New York and it is volunteers
like her who strengthen communities around
the country.

LARRY KIKER
HON. FRANCIS ROONEY
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in honor of Lee County Commis-
sioner Larry Kiker, who passed away early
Tuesday, April 23 at Hope Hospice.
Mr. Kiker grew up in Clovis, New Mexico
and moved to Southwest Florida two decades
ago. After moving to Florida, he became a
charter boat captain and then owned and op-
erated a Fort Myers Beach realty company
with his beloved wife, Paula.
Larry was first elected to the county com-
mission in 2012—defeating a 24-year incum-
bent commissioner—and won re-election in
2016. Prior to his service as commissioner,
Mr. Kiker had a long career in managing cus-
tomer service at several high-tech companies,
and served as a Fort Myers Beach Town
Councilman and as mayor. Larry’s leadership
and team building skills were well recognized
by his peers and the citizens of Southwest
Florida.
Larry served our community with honor. We
are all grateful for his contributions and com-
mitment to our community. His passion, intel-
lect, and wit will be long remembered, and

HONORING THE 85TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE WORLD RECORD
WIND ON MOUNT WASHINGTON
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to acknowledge the 85th anniversary of the
world record wind. On April 12, 1934, civilian
scientists at the top of Mount Washington ob-
served wind speeds of 231 miles per hour. For
over 60 years, this stood as the fastest wind
gust ever recorded, and today it remains the
fastest surface wind speed ever observed by
humans.
New Hampshire’s way of life is rooted in our
natural surroundings, and few sites are as
closely associated with the Granite State as
Mount Washington. As a lifelong resident of
New Hampshire, I have always marveled at
the might of Mount Washington. At 6,288 feet,
it is the tallest peak in the Northeast. And
while there are certainly taller, snowier, and
even colder places on Earth, Mount Wash-
ington has mesmerized Granite Staters and
people around the world for decades because
of its ruggedness and sheer unpredictability.
While the world record wind is certainly no-
table in its own regard, it also serves as a tes-
tament to the dedication, hard work, and pub-
lic service of the Mount Washington Observ-
atory. Since 1932, the Mount Washington Ob-
servatory has not only monitored the weather
on top of the mountain but also served as a
critical educational and climate research re-
source.
The Mount Washington Observatory has pi-
oneered innovative forms of weather research
and wind tracking data for over 85 years.
Their pioneering curiosity has led to universal
intrigue about Mount Washington, and today,
people from all over the world, visit New
Hampshire for the opportunity to hike or drive
to its summit. The Observatory’s continuing
contribution to science and education are im-
measurable.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
congratulate the Mount Washington Observ-
atory on the anniversary of this
groundbreaking feat. I look forward to con-
tinuing the celebration when I hike Mount
Washington this summer. Once again, I thank
the Mount Washington Observatory for all that
they do to make the Granite State such a
wonderful place to live, learn, and hike.

CONGRATULATING PAUL RUMLER
ON WINNING THE QUAD-CITIES
MALE CHAMPION OF CHANGE
AWARD
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Paul Rumler for winning the
Quad-Cities Male Champion of Change Award
for his work as president and CEO of the
Quad-Cities Chamber of Commerce.
The Quad-Cities Athena Awards are given
to one woman and one man who are com-
mitted to gender diversity and empowering
women in leadership. Under Mr. Rumler’s
leadership, 13 women have been hired or pro-
moted within the Quad-Cities Chamber of
Commerce, which was one of his top goals in
the role. These efforts to make the organiza-
tion more inclusive and, as a whole, more rep-
resentative of our community. Mr. Rumler is
dedicated to his work in the Quad-Cities re-
gion and is an asset to the community where
he has fought for women’s aspirations and
goals. I commend Mr. Rumler for his work and
look forward to seeing his future accomplish-
ments.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
Paul Rumler that I am especially proud to
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District.
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally
congratulate Paul Rumler for winning the
Quad-Cities Male Champion of Change Award
and thank him for empowering women in our
community.

HONORING MR. CHARLES ‘‘CHUCK’’
CORJAY
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
ask the House of Representatives to join me
in celebrating the exemplary life of Mr. Charles
‘‘Chuck’’ Corjay.
Mr. Corjay was born in 1932 in Springfield,
MA to John and Helen Solenski as the young-
est of three sons. He served in the U.S. Air
Force for over seven years, including during
the Korean War. Mr. Corjay later dedicated his
life to helping others pursue an education. As
a lifetime member of the Armed Forces Com-
munications and Electronics Association he
was the first recipient of the NoVa AFCEAN of
the Year Award, now known as ‘‘The Corjay
Award’’, for raising over $10 million in STEM
scholarships and financial assistance for vet-
erans.
Mr. Corjay also forged a lifelong career in
Information Technology. As the Senior Vice
President of DoD Strategy with CACI Inter-
national Inc., he built successful relationships
at senior levels within the Department of De-
fense. In 2007, he was named to Federal
Computer Week’s Federal 100 list of IT lead-
ers.
Mr. Corjay passed away peacefully on
March 17, 2019 and is survived by his wife
Diane and his daughter Marcy. He was known
as a friend, mentor, and coach to all, and his
spirit and character are reflected in his vast
network of friends.
Madam Speaker, I extend my deep condo-
lences to Mr. Corjay’s family and friends and
ask that you join me in recognizing his life and
legacy.
COMMEMORATING THE ONE HUN-
DREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
GENEVA ROTARY CLUB
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the one hundredth anniversary
of the Geneva Rotary Club.
On May 12, 1919, twenty-five Genevans be-
came the charter members of the Geneva Ro-
tary Club. As they installed their first officers,
President Edward Dean, Vice President John
Farwell, and Secretary William Gracey, this
newly founded branch of Rotary International
made a commitment to service in their com-
munity.
The Rotary International motto is Service
Above Self and Geneva Rotary has embodied
that principle over one hundred years of rais-
ing money and supporting community service
projects. Their fundraisers such as Pancake
Suppers, the Poinsettia Sale, the Santa Train
Express, and the Service Above Self Dinner
have brought together the community in Gene-
va to support a variety of good causes. Over
the years their work has supported the likes of
Geneva General Hospital, the Boys and Girls
Club, United Way, the Community Dinner Pro-
gram, Happiness House, and the Geneva
Public Library.
Geneva Rotary has helped to ensure that
the spirit of service is alive and well in the city
of Geneva. Rotarians are active volunteers
and more than eighty men and women belong
to the club today.
One hundred years of service in the com-
munity is certainly a cause for celebration. I
congratulate the Geneva Rotary Club on this
impressive milestone and look forward to their
continued success in the years to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of
the Geneva Rotary Club.

Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today

congratulate her on receiving the League of
Women Voters of Broward County’s 2019 Ex-
cellence in Leadership Award. Barbara is well-
deserving of this recognition for her efforts to
reduce firearm deaths throughout Broward
County, Florida.
Barbara Markley is a practicing attorney and
gun safety advocate. She is the Co-Chair of
the Gun Safety Committee for the League of
Women Voters of Broward. Her innovative
Lock it Up! Gun Safety Program, created in
partnership with the Miami VA, has distributed
23,000 educational brochures and 11,200 gun
locks in Broward in just 6 months with the help
of 180 community partners. Her goal is to edu-
cate everyone about the dangers of unlocked
guns and to save lives.

REMARKS ON H.R. 1957, THE
TAXPAYER FIRST ACT OF 2019
HON. KATIE PORTER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, while there
are many beneficial provisions in H.R. 1957,
Section 1102 should be stripped from the leg-
islation. This section would prohibit the Inter-
nal Revenue Service (IRS) from ever estab-
lishing a free file system for taxpayers by codi-
fying an existing contract between the IRS and
private taxpayer preparation software compa-
nies (e.g. TurboTax, H&R Block, Intuit).
The National Consumer Law Center has
previously written an opposition letter on this
provision in the bill. Such a free filing system
could save American taxpayers billions of dol-
lars per year otherwise spent on taxpayer
preparation services.
While individuals earning less than $66,000
are currently eligible for free federal filing via
private software companies due to the con-
tract with the IRS, only 3 percent of such indi-
viduals take advantage of free filing, and mil-
lions more households outside the very mod-
est income limit could benefit from an IRS-built
system.
An IRS free file system could also have the
benefit of ending a current, predatory practice:
low-income taxpayers are upsold by taxpayer
preparation services into costly add-on prod-
ucts like refund anticipation loans, which are
essentially payday loans backed by future tax
refunds.
Finally, even if the IRS does not have the
capacity to build their own free file system,
H.R. 1957 would preclude renegotiation of the
current contract with private software devel-
opers in order to get better terms for tax-
payers in a future, Democratically-controlled
IRS.

IN RECOGNITION OF MS. MAMIE
HUGHES’ 90TH BIRTHDAY
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to honor a dynamic woman in my district.
On May 3, 2019, Mamie Currie Hughes will
celebrate her 90th birthday. While turning 90
is a major feat in itself, it’s what she has done
during these years that makes her so special.
Mamie Hughes has been a civil and women’s
rights champion in Kansas City since the
1950’s.
Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Ms. Hughes
graduated from Stanton High School at six-
teen years of age. At that young age, she left
Florida to attend Fisk University in Nashville,
Tennessee where she met her husband Leon-
ard Hughes, Jr. Upon graduation in 1949, the
couple married and moved to his hometown of
Kansas City, Missouri.
Ms. Hughes taught elementary school upon
arriving in Kansas City. By 1958, as a member
of Community Committee for Social Action,
she became part of a movement to abolish
discriminatory practices of the major depart-
ment stores in downtown Kansas City, Mis-
souri.
During the 1950’s and 60’s she continued to
fight segregation while also raising a family,
after giving birth to five children. Even so, her
commitment to her community never wavered.
From 1957 through 1975, Ms. Hughes served
with women of all races on the Panel of Amer-
ican Women, an organization that gave pres-
entations describing how discrimination, rac-
ism and bigotry affects lives. These commu-
nity discussions were often held in areas that
blacks and other minorities were not wel-
comed. In 1972, Ms. Hughes was the first
black woman elected to the Jackson County
legislature where she served two terms. Dur-
ing her time in the legislature, Ms. Hughes
was the Chair of the Mid-America Regional
Council (MARC) Board of Directors and its
Commission on Aging. While at MARC, she
assisted with the implementation of the 911
emergency assistance development and
worked on the establishment of the Meals on
Wheels program that provides food delivery
for senior citizens.
In 1978, my House colleague, Rep. JOHN
LEWIS, interviewed Ms. Hughes and rec-
ommended her to President Carter, who ap-
pointed her the Regional Administrator to AC-
TION/VISTA, the predecessor of AmeriCorps
VISTA and the United States government
agency that serves as the federal domestic
volunteer agency. The agency’s responsibil-
ities included the domestic volunteer programs
established under the Office of Economic Op-
portunity including the Foster Grandparents
programs and the Peace Corps. It also as-
sumed logistical support responsibilities for the
volunteer programs of the SBA’s Service
Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) and the
senior companion programs that later became
the Senior Corps.
After her federal service, Ms. Hughes’ be-
came President of the Black Economic Union
(BEU) of Greater Kansas City, one of the
country’s oldest community development cor-
porations. During her tenure at BEU, Ms.
Hughes’s efforts focused on the stabilization
and preservation of buildings with historic sig-
nificance. That work ultimately laid the founda-
tion for the Cleaver Plan, which resulted in
Kansas City’s Historic 18th and Vine Jazz Dis-
trict.
In 1986, Ms. Hughes resumed her govern-
mental service and became the City of Kansas
City, Missouri’s Ombudsman for the Bruce R.
Watkins (BRW) Roadway. Her responsibilities
included working on behalf of residents af-
fected by the construction of the BRW Road-
way. During her tenure with the city, Ms.
Hughes’ reputation as a fierce neighborhood
liaison grew because of her tireless dedication
to assisting those adversely affected.
Over her lifetime, Ms. Hughes has received
various awards and honors too numerous to
mention here. Most recently, however, she
was included in a special group honored by
former First Lady Laura Bush and inducted
into the University of Missouri at Kansas City’s
Starr Hall of Fame recognizing women who
have made the Kansas City community a bet-
ter place through impressive lifetime accom-
plishments.
In 2016, Ms. Hughes penned her autobiog-
raphy entitled Mamie Who? The Life and
Times of a Colored Woman, chronicling her
efforts against racism and championing wom-
en’s rights. For over 70 years she has fought
for equal rights for all and for the improvement
of Kansas City as a whole. Because of her in-
credible service to our community, I would like
to congratulate her on celebrating her 90th
birthday and thank her for making Kansas City
a better, more just place for all to live.

HONORING THE 17TH INTER-
NATIONAL FESTIVAL OF LAN-
GUAGE AND CULTURE
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
ask the House of Representatives to join me
in honoring the 17th International Festival of
Language and Culture (IFLC).
The International Festival of Language and
Culture has been bringing talented youth from
around the world together to express their cul-
tures in song, dance, and other artistic per-
formances since 2002. The first festival was
launched in Turkey, and since 2013 it has
been held in countries all over the world, in-
cluding Germany, Australia and Romania. The
IFLC has also hosted shows in the United
States since 2015, when IFLC became estab-
lished in Washington, D.C. and registered as
a U.S.-based nonprofit organization. The IFLC
is committed to contributing to world peace
and dialog by gathering young people from
around the world regardless of their race, reli-
gion or language to share music and dance
performances together.
This year, the IFLC will host a show and re-
ception in Washington, D.C. on April 29, 2019
with more than 80 participants from over 16
countries performing.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I ask
the House of Representatives to join me in
honoring this annual celebration and show-
case for diverse talent from across the world.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
ELIAS W. ‘‘CHUCK’’ HADDAD
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Chuck Haddad, who
passed away on Tuesday, April 16, 2019 at
the age of 85. The namesake of the Haddad
car dealerships in Bakersfield, California,
Chuck was an esteemed local businessman
and philanthropist and most importantly, a
friend to many in our community including my-
self.
Chuck’s life story is a true embodiment of
the American dream. Having grown up in Leb-
anon, he moved to the United States to attend

Wabash College in Indiana. However, as
Chuck soon found out, the Midwest gets a bit
colder than the Mediterranean climate where
he was raised. Fortunately, he found a suit-
able alternative in the great state of California,
where he moved shortly thereafter to attend
Stanford University in Palo Alto. It was here
that Chuck’s automobile career began when,
while shopping for a car of his own, the dealer
was so impressed with his bargaining skills
that he offered Chuck a salesman position on
the spot. Within a year he was the dealer-
ship’s General Manager. Chuck went on to
open his own dealership in East Los Angeles
in 1973, followed by Haddad Dodge in Bakers-
field, California in 1974. Chuck and his family
owned the Dodge dealership, Haddad Kia,
and have ownership stakes in Nissan of Ba-
kersfield, BMW of Bakersfield, and Bakersfield
Chrysler Jeep FIAT.
Outside of his dealerships, perhaps the pro-
fessional accomplishment Chuck was most
proud of was winning a landmark court case
against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In
Bakersfield Dodge Inc. v. The IRS, the 9th Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals ruled that car dealer-
ships have the right to allocate certain finan-
cial resources for tax purposes, benefitting
automotive dealers across the country. Any-
one that knew Chuck would be unsurprised to
hear how proud he was to have been able to
help others. In fact, Chuck helped countless
people in the Bakersfield area by his generous
contributions to charitable causes such as re-
search for juvenile diabetes, arthritis, heart
disease, cancer and leukemia. He also pro-
vided leadership and guidance on the Cali-
fornia State University Bakersfield’s business
advisory panel, the Greater Bakersfield Cham-
ber of Commerce, and the Kern County His-
panic Chamber of Commerce, just to name a
few.
But Chuck was most proud of the great love
story of him and his late wife, Inger. Together
as parents to James and Lisa, John and Mer-
edith, and Jeff and Tina, and grandparents to
Michael, Ryan, Allie and Ryan, Jacob, Joshua
and Maci, their lives were filled with many
memorable moments. As a husband, father,
grandfather and friend, we will always remem-
ber Chuck’s devotion to family. As a philan-
thropist, Chuck’s commitment to community
was evident through his many civic contribu-
tions as well, most notably through the Na-
tional Automobile Dealers Association.
Through the association, he was dedicated to
fostering relationships with our local, state and
federal elected officials recognizing the impor-
tance of effective leadership. Chuck held true
to his conservative principles as was evident
in his support of helping candidates who
shared these values pursue successful cam-
paigns. As a member of the Kern County Re-
publican Party, he received the 2016 Repub-
lican of the Year Award, where his tireless ef-
forts on behalf of a grateful party were recog-
nized.
The measure of a man’s life can be found
in his character, in his optimism, in his joy and
humor, in his courage and passion for what is
good and right and in his love for family,
neighbor and country. This was the life of
Chuck Haddad.
On behalf of the 23rd Congressional District
of California, we remember my friend, Chuck
Haddad, and extend our most heartfelt condo-
lences to the Haddad family.
HONORING THE LIFE OF CARL
MCGEE, JR.
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today, I rise
in recognition and celebration of the life of a
fellow Texan and decorated WWII Veteran,
Carl McGee, Jr. His commitment to his com-
munity, the Great State of Texas, and the
United States of America represents the best
of our country and I encourage all members to
join me in honoring this American hero’s life.
In December of 1941, as the world inched
ever closer to the Second World War, 18-year-
old Carl McGee, Jr. made the decision to en-
list and serve his country. He began training at
the Army Air Forces Technical School, at
Chanute Field III, and was later appointed to
the Air Corps Advanced Flying School in Lub-
bock, Texas.
Following his success in flight school, First
Lieutenant McGee received his wings on Jan-
uary 14, 1943 and subsequently moved to
California to join the 450th AAF Base Unit
Squadron-A at Hammer Field. As a C–47 pilot,
Lieutenant McGee operated in the Pacific The-
ater, including the Western Pacific, Southern
Philippines, New Guinea, and the Bismarck
Archipelago. By the remarkable young age of
20, Lieutenant McGee had participated in 50
flight missions where hostile contact was not
only probable, but expected.
In recognition of his service and dedication,
Lieutenant McGee was awarded the pres-
tigious Distinguished Flying Cross to com-
mend his efforts in safely transporting troops
and supplies through adverse weather, low al-
titudes, and dangerous mountain terrain. Upon
receiving this award, he became the youngest
member of the Distinguished Flying Cross So-
ciety. Lieutenant McGee was also awarded
the Air Medal, with three Oak Leaf Clusters,
as well as the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal,
with four bronze service stars, and the Amer-
ican Defense Service Medal. His many awards
and recognitions serve as important reminders
of the dedicated years he served our nation.
Lieutenant McGee then went on to begin his
professional career as a pilot for Pioneer Air-
lines, which later became Continental Airlines.
After many years of service to both our coun-
try and the aviation community, Lieutenant
McGee began his well-deserved retirement on
his 60th birthday in 1983. Lieutenant McGee
passed away on April 8, 2019, surrounded by
his friends and family, beloved by all who
knew him. He is preceded in death by his par-
ents, Carl and Florence McGee, and his son,
Patrick McGee. He is survived by his wife,
Cinda McGee; and his wonderful children,
Dennis McGee, Andrew McGee, and Michelle
Ciancio.
Today, it is my honor to celebrate the long
life of a decorated veteran, devoted father,
and extraordinary Texan. He is a member of
the Greatest Generation, and I know I speak
for the entire Eighth District of Texas when I
say: Thank you for all you have done for our
Country, you will be deeply missed.
HONORING COHUTTA, GEORGIA
HON. TOM GRAVES
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the town of Cohutta,
Georgia and commemorate the 50th anniver-
sary of its incorporation.
Though incorporated relatively recently,
Cohutta has a history that stretches back to
when Northwest Georgia was first settled.
Its name, Cohutta, comes from the Cher-
okee word for foggy weather, and it served as
the capital of the Cherokee nation from 1832
to 1838.
Boasting Red Clay State Historic Park,
Cohutta has truly embraced the rich history of
the Cherokee nation that first settled there, al-
lowing visitors to appreciate 630 acres of nat-
ural beauty and historical significance.
Like many towns in Georgia, Cohutta came
to be through the growth of the railroad, and
Norfolk Southern continues to link it with the
rest of the state.
Today, it boasts a population of over 600,
and the University of Georgia’s Cohutta Fish-
eries Center continues to provide research
and education opportunities for folks from
across Georgia and our nation.
As all of Georgia celebrates with Cohutta
this Saturday for a day of parades, BBQ, and
family fun, I offer the students of Cohutta Ele-
mentary a hearty ‘Go Dogs’ and congratulate
the town on the 50th anniversary of its incor-
poration.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ENSURING
SUCCESSFUL REENTRY ACT OF
2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, in
recognition of April as Second Chance Month,
I introduce the Ensuring Successful Reentry
Act of 2019, a bill to eliminate so-called ‘‘sub-
sistence fees.’’ Federal law currently requires
the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to im-
pose a subsistence fee on the income of of-
fenders living in residential reentry centers
(RRCs), supposedly to promote financial re-
sponsibility by requiring RRC residents to pay
a portion of their housing costs. The fee is
currently 25 percent. However, many offend-
ers living in RRCs often work minimum wage
jobs, so the loss of 25 percent of their pay-
checks is a significant hurdle to successful re-
entry, and it makes it extremely difficult for
them to save money for rent, pay child sup-
port, or fines and fees associated with their
conviction (such as restitution). Recently, BOP
eliminated the subsistence fee for offenders
on home confinement, who cost BOP almost
nothing for maintenance. Far from promoting
financial responsibility, subsistence fees actu-
ally prevent returning citizens from meeting
their financial obligations.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has al-
ready recognized how ‘‘counterproductive’’
subsistence fees are, both for offenders and
BOP. In a November 2016 memo, then-Dep-
uty Attorney General Sally Q. Yates noted that

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E487
April 25, 2019
BOP’s ‘‘process for collecting these subsist-
ence fees is costly and administratively bur-
densome for both RRC’s and [BOP],’’ and
called for DOJ to ‘‘develop a plan to limit the
use of counterproductive ‘subsistence’ fees
imposed on indigent residents.’’ BOP can al-
ready waive subsistence fees in certain situa-
tions for residents of RRCs, but only a change
in federal law can remove this unnecessary
barrier to reentry.
We should not be imposing additional bur-
dens on returning citizens, setting them up to
fail, especially those who are employed and
working toward independence from the crimi-
nal justice system. Jobs and affordable hous-
ing are crucial components in ensuring suc-
cessful reentry—charging subsistence fees is
antithetical to this goal. I urge my colleagues
to support this bill.

COMMEMORATING THE ONE HUN-
DREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
FINGER LAKES TOURISM ALLI-
ANCE
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the one hundredth anniversary
of the Finger Lakes Tourism Alliance.
On April 25, 1919, Finger Lakes Tourism Al-
liance’s founders came together in Auburn,
New York to organize a cooperative to pro-
mote tourism in the region. They sought to co-
operatively market the Finger Lakes region,
develop signage to direct tourists, and ensure
service stations were equipped to accommo-
date travelers. One hundred years later, the
Finger Lakes Tourism Alliance continues to
serve the Finger Lakes Region and is consid-
ered the oldest regional destination marketing
organization in the United States.
Spanning fourteen counties, the Finger
Lakes Region is home to more than four hun-
dred registered historic sites and landmarks,
one hundred thirty-five museums, eighty art
galleries, fourteen professional theatre compa-
nies, one hundred wineries, three hundred bed
and breakfasts, one thousand sixty-three wa-
terfalls and gorges, twenty-six state parks, two
thousand miles of hiking/biking trails and six
hundred fifty miles of shoreline. The Alliance
partners with attractions and tourism-related
businesses to showcase this beautiful and
unique area.
We recognize the importance of the Finger
Lakes Region to our local communities and
we support designating the region as a Na-
tional Heritage Area. The Finger Lakes Na-
tional Heritage Area Study Act passed the
House of Representatives with our support,
taking an important first step in achieving that
goal. We will continue to be a strong advocate
for the Finger Lakes Region.
One hundred years of promoting our local
communities is certainly a cause for celebra-
tion. I congratulate the Finger Lakes Tourism
Alliance on this impressive milestone and look
forward to their continued success in the years
to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of
the Finger Lakes Tourism Alliance.

HONORING DALE FREEMAN
HON. A. DREW FERGUSON IV
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the passing of Mr. Dale Free-
man. Mr. Dale Freeman was, simply put, the
best teacher I ever had at any level of edu-
cation. More than any other instructor, he
taught me how to think independently and cre-
atively. He taught me how to be disciplined in
the basic foundations of writing and critical
thinking. Having a solid foundation is essential
to creativity because it provides a place to re-
turn to after exploring new ideas. Mr. Freeman
truly loved learning and teaching. He cared
deeply about his students and made them bet-
ter equipped to handle the world around them.
In fact, his work with students has given them
the tools to shape the world around them. He
was a compassionate person and I am grate-
ful to have had him as an instructor. As we
mark his passing here today, I wish his family
healing in this season of loss.

HONORING MARTINEZ ADULT
EDUCATION
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Martinez
Adult Education on its 100th year of providing
comprehensive adult education programs to
our community.
Martinez Adult Education began in 1919
when local Shell refinery employees sought
evening classes to learn new skills and further
their education. Today, Martinez Adult Edu-
cation offers programs and classes on career
readiness, college transition, literacy, and edu-
cational enrichment. Martinez Adult Education
provides English as a Second Language and
citizenship courses, high school completion
opportunities, adult literacy resources, and
trainings for adults seeking career changes or
enhancements. Martinez Adult Education
works to serve the needs of each individual
that utilizes its services.
Martinez Adult Education serves more than
1,900 students annually and the English as a
Second Language program enrolls students
from 46 countries. It is the only adult edu-
cation school in California to offer Peace Offi-
cer Standards and Training modules. Addition-
ally, it serves as the Local Education Agency
for seven apprenticeship programs.
Martinez Adult Education is fully accredited
by the Schools Commission of the Western
Association of Schools and Colleges and has
formed partnerships with six other local adult
schools. Additionally, Martinez Adult Education
collaborates with Contra Costa Community
College and the County Office of Education.
Madam Speaker, Martinez Adult Education
strives to provide access to education, career
training, and other community resources to un-
derserved and diverse populations in our com-
munity. It is committed to providing community
members with the needed skills and education
to further their careers and thrive in other as-
pects of their lives. Therefore, it is fitting and
proper that we honor Martinez Adult Education
here today.

CONGRATULATING LA GRANDE
AMERICAN LEGION POST NO. 43
HON. GREG WALDEN
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate the La Grande American Le-
gion Post No. 43 on 100 years of service to
eastern Oregon, and for their continued sup-
port and leadership in my home state.
In Oregon, we understand how important it
is to support our veterans. The La Grande
Post No. 43 has been a steadfast partner in
this effort. With over 117 Posts and 17,000
fraternal members in Oregon—and over 2 mil-
lion affiliate members—the American Legion is
a strong advocate for the veteran community
in our great state of Oregon and across the
country.
The La Grande Post No. 43 has been a vital
part of the community during these last one
hundred years. They place American flags on
veterans’ graves on Memorial Day and orga-
nize and participate in local veterans’ parades.
They also lead donation efforts for local fire-
fighters’ organizations, make monthly visits to
veterans in retirement homes in our commu-
nity, mount up the Patriot Guard to attend fu-
nerals with aims-firing details, and volun-
teering thousands of hours at VA medical fa-
cilities.
A little over a year ago, I had breakfast with
a group of veterans—some of whom are
members of Post No. 43—that spend time
every week serving ice cream to disabled vet-
erans throughout La Grande and the sur-
rounding community. They call themselves the
‘‘Vets Ice Cream Patrol,’’ and the time and en-
ergy they spend with veterans every week is
a simple, but powerful, gesture of camaraderie
and service.
Over the past 100 years, the American Le-
gion has assisted over 700,000 veterans and
families across the nation in collecting their
benefits; honored our veterans and led memo-
rial tributes for fallen comrades; and volun-
teered thousands of hours at VA medical fa-
cilities. La Grande Post No. 43 has been a
valued part of that tradition.
Being a champion for our veterans is an en-
deavor that transcends party lines and is a
small expression of gratitude for all they have
done to protect our freedoms. The American
Legion has led the effort in this, with an em-
phasis on service to the local community and
volunteerism to improve the quality of life for
Oregon veterans.
In celebration and gratitude for all that they
do, I ask my colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating the La Grande American Legion
Post No. 43 on 100 years of unwavering serv-
ice to Oregon veterans.

BERS OF TROOP 146 FOR EARN-
ING THE EAGLE SCOUT RANK
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor four outstanding young
men, Ryan Calhoun, James Hicks, James
Hunt and Evan Welch of Troop 146 in
Braselton, Georgia, for attaining the rank of
Eagle Scout with the Boy Scouts of America.
Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy
Scout can attain, and only a small fraction of
Boy Scouts ever reach the rank. This achieve-
ment requires years upon years of tireless
work and dedication to develop the requisite
leadership, service and outdoor skills.
Each of these young men have earned their
Eagle Scout rank by completing hundreds of
hours of community service, earning merit
badges and completing a final Eagle Scout
project. For his final project, Ryan completed
a bird sanctuary at his local church which fea-
tured an inspiring biblical theme. James Hicks
built a bee habitat to educate his community
about the importance of supporting declining
bee populations. James Hunt repaired two pic-
nic tables and an entire bridge in the Georgia
State Arboretum to ensure the forest can con-
tinue meeting the safety needs of its visitors.
Evan Welch completed the landscaping and
construction of an entire picnic area which will
surely provide guests enjoyment for years to
come.
On behalf of the people of Northeast Geor-
gia, I want to congratulate these young men
for becoming Eagle Scouts. I am incredibly
proud of the many hours they have dedicated
to making a difference in their communities,
and I look forward to watching them continue
to serve as exceptional leaders.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF FRED
STARRH, SR.
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Fred Starrh, Sr., who
passed away on April 16, 2019 at the age of
89. Fred was a renowned farmer in Califor-
nia’s Central Valley whose career spanned
nearly seventy years. He was also a devoted
family man, philanthropist, follower of Jesus
Christ, and my dear friend.
Born to a family of cotton farmers at the
onset of the Great Depression and having
come of age during the Second World War,
the value of hard work and the importance of
serving one’s country were instilled in Fred at
a young age. In fact, Fred answered the call
to serve when his draft number was selected
during the Korean War. Stationed in Fort
Lewis in Washington State, it was there he
met his first loving wife of 54 years, Nancy
Johnson, who passed away in 2009. Fred
then fell in love with and married Linda.
Fred returned to his roots after the war,
managing the 35-acre family cotton farm in
Shafter, California, that his father founded in
1935. The operation quickly expanded and di-
versified under Fred’s guidance, with an addi-
tional location in Buttonwillow, California, and
the production of specialty crops, including
pistachios and almonds. Today, the Starrh
Family Farms operation spans over 9,000
acres.
Fred was also a staunch advocate for Kern
County and Central Valley farmers and the
farming industry generally. For instance, when
the U.S. Department of Agriculture closed a
research facility in Shafter, California, that was
doing critical research on a cotton disease,
Fred, through the San Joaquin Valley Quality
Cotton Growers Association, stepped up to the
plate and led the charge to keep the facility
open and in operation by partnering with Kern
County and the local community college.
Throughout his 68-year career, Fred also
advanced agricultural interests by serving on
countless boards and councils, and joining nu-
merous associations. Among these, Fred was
particularly proud to sit on the Kern County
Water Agency Board of Directors. In this ca-
pacity, Fred played a critical role and was a
key decision-maker advancing commonsense
water policies in Kern County and California.
For those of you who know California water
politics, things can get heated quickly, but
Fred, the consummate gentleman, could draw
on his vast experience and detailed knowl-
edge to find common ground to bring people
back to the table to get solutions—all without
raising his voice.
Fred also served on the Kern County Farm
Bureau’s Board of Directors, was a Director
for the California Farm Bureau Federation,
and was appointed to serve on the Cotton Ag-
ricultural Trade Advisory Committee and the
Cotton Marketing Committee by then-Sec-
retary of Agriculture Ed Madigan, where he
advised the Secretary and other officials at the
U.S. Department of Agriculture on the land-
mark 1990 Farm Bill. Fred further served his
beloved Central Valley community on the
board of the Kern High School District for 17
years, and was a founding member of the
Shafter Recreation District, where he both
supported and participated in local music and
arts programs.
Fred held unwavering faith in the goodness
of God. As a member of the Shafter Con-
gregational Church, Fred could always be
found singing in the choir with his family and
friends.
Fred is survived by his wife, Linda, his four
children, Fred Jr. and his wife Cris, Larry and
his wife Shana, Carol and her husband Jay,
and Anne and her husband Dale, his seven
grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, and an
entire family that loved him deeply. Fred
Starrh was truly a larger-than-life personality,
and when I would seek his counsel on any
issue big or small, he always had sage advice.
I am honored to have been able to call Fred
one of my close friends.
On behalf of Kern County and our friends
and neighbors throughout the 23rd Congres-
sional District of California, Judy and I extend
our deepest condolences to the Starrh family
as we remember and honor the life of Fred
Starrh, Sr.
CELEBRATING THE INTER-
NATIONAL FESTIVAL OF LAN-
GUAGE AND CULTURE
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in celebrating the International Festival of
Language and Culture (IFLC). For the past 16
years, the IFLC has been showcasing both
international diversity and the talent of our
youth through poetry, song and dance from
their cultures.
This year, Washington, D.C. is one of many
world capitals co-hosting the IFLC. More than
80 participants from over 16 countries are in-
vited to perform. This event brings together
young students, parents, teachers and volun-
teers to promote diversity. These talented stu-
dent-performers work tirelessly for several
months in anticipation of meeting American
audiences, including members of the U.S.
Congress.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating the students, parents,
teachers and volunteers of the International
Festival of Language and Culture for their ef-
forts.

RECOGNIZING SCHIMELPFENIG
MIDDLE SCHOOL
HON. VAN TAYLOR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, each year,
the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-
Grades Reform in conjunction with the Texas
Association of Secondary Schools Principals
designate the coveted title of ‘‘Texas School to
Watch’’ to a select groups of schools that
have consistently moved to fully meet the na-
tionally endorsed criteria for high-performing
middle schools.
These schools have demonstrated marked
progress in meeting all required criteria, in-
cluding measurable gains in the academic
achievement of their student population,
paired with a continual commitment to im-
provement.
Today, I proudly ask my colleagues in the
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Schimelpfenig Middle School of Plano,
Texas as one of thirty named ‘‘Texas Schools
to Watch.’’ Our state leaders selected
Schimelpfenig based on its academic excel-
lence, developmental responsiveness, social
equity, and organizational structure and proc-
esses. Coupled with their strong leadership,
Schimelpfenig Middle School is renowned for
its teachers who consistently collaborate to im-
prove programs while creating a positive
learning environment.
To Principal Dr. Brant Perry, the staff, stu-
dents, parents, and the Plano Independent
School District under the leadership of Super-
intendent Sara Bonser, I congratulate them on
being named a Texas School to Watch. I am
confident they will continue their dedicated ef-

COMMEMORATING THE 104TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN
GENOCIDE
HON. TJ COX
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to commemorate the 104th anniver-
sary of the Armenian genocide. April 24, 1915
marked the beginning of the Ottoman Turks’
systematic deportation and murder of over 1.5
million Christian Armenians, Greeks, and As-
syrians, marking the first genocide of the 20th
century.
To this day, however, neither the President
of the United States nor Congress have recog-
nized this tragedy as what it is: a genocide.
This does not do justice to the vibrant Arme-
nian-American community in the Central Val-
ley—a result of survivors settling anew after
being displaced. The families of the Central
Valley have not forgotten the pain of their an-
cestors and continue to advocate for justice
with passion and persistence. Today, I am
proud to be their voice and have joined my
colleagues in introducing a Resolution this
Congress, recognizing and memorializing the
Armenian Genocide.
The Armenian people are a great example
of what it means to move forward while re-
membering who they are and where they
come from. Recognizing what happened in
1915 as genocide is the first step towards rec-
onciling with the past, something that is long
overdue. We must reconsider our relationship
with Turkey and entities that deny the Arme-
nian genocide and uphold our American val-
ues by promoting justice and peace. It is our
responsibility to ensure our future generations
never forget this critical moment in history and
that we continue pushing for its official rec-
ognition.
Madam Speaker, I call upon my colleagues
to join me in condemning all crimes against
humanity in the past, present, and future. We
must learn from this atrocity and continue to
advocate for the protection of human rights for
the Armenian people, and for all.

TRIBUTE TO I.A.T.S.E. LOCAL 728
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the International Alliance of Theatrical
Stage Employees Local 728 upon its 80th an-
niversary.
Chartered in 1939, Local 728 has served
thousands of studio electrical lighting techni-
cians in the motion picture community. Today,
Local 728 provides its members with a myriad
of services such as legal, medical, and finan-
cial assistance. The union also works hard to
ensure its members receive the best retire-
ment benefits and disability insurance. With a
rich and long history, Local 728 has been in-
volved in both federal and state political action
on behalf of its members, including lobbying
efforts to keep jobs in California. Their advo-
cacy for worker-centered initiatives has
pushed California to be a leader in raising
wages and improving education for its work-
ers. Since its inception, Local 728 has grown
to represent over 2,700 studio electrical light-
ing technicians and has been a shining exam-
ple of what a strong labor union can achieve.
For eighty years, Local 728 has not only
supported backlot technicians with assisted
services but has also offered various occupa-
tional safety and job skills trainings to ensure
that members are always performing the in-
dustry-best practices. These include helpful re-
sources on Rigging for Wet Locations,
LXBeams Software Training, and assistance in
completing the Entertainment Technician Cer-
tification Program. Through these services,
Local 728 continues to demonstrate their
strong commitment to the well-being of its
members. Their efforts exemplify the ever-im-
portant values of civic engagement, respect
for the rights and safety of others, and to instill
hard work in all members.
It is my pleasure to honor I.A.T.S.E. Local
728 for eighty years of dedication and service
to the Los Angeles area’s studio electrical
lighting technicians. I ask all members to join
me in commending their efforts.

HONORING KEVIN BARR
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today with my colleague Con-
gressman JARED HUFFMAN to recognize Kevin
Barr as the recipient of the 2019 Viticulture
Award of Excellence. This award recognizes
grape growers who have made significant con-
tributions to our Sonoma County wine commu-
nity and Sonoma County overall.
Mr. Barr attended the University of Cali-
fornia, Davis where he earned a Bachelor of
Science in Agricultural Management with a
specialization in Viticulture and has since been
committed to sustainability and conservation.
Mr. Barr started his company, Redwood Em-
pire Vineyard Management (REVM), in 1983,
which sustainably develops farms and other
properties. Mr. Barr is committed to sustain-
able farming and conservation. REVM was the
first vineyard management company to be cer-
tified sustainable in California and has 22 cli-
ents that have been certified by the California
Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance.
Mr. Barr has been an active and involved
community member since he first moved to
Sonoma County in 1979. He is a current
board member and past chairman of the
Sonoma County Winegrape Commission
Board. His expertise played no small role in
the Commission certifying 100 percent of
Sonoma County’s vineyards as sustainable by
2019. Mr. Barr is also the current chairman of
the Santa Rosa Junior College Viticulture Ad-
visory Board and the Sonoma County Grape
Growers Foundation Board.
The 2019 Viticulture Award of Excellence is
not the first time Mr. Barr has been recognized
for his contributions and commitment to our
community. He received the Leadership in Ag-
riculture Award from the Santa Rosa Chamber
of Commerce in 2015, the Award of Excel-
lence for Sustainability in Farming in 2016,
and the Nick Frey Community Contribution
Award in 2018. Despite his well-deserved ac-
colades, Mr. Barr has remained humble and
dedicated to sustainable farming and our com-
munity.
Madam Speaker, Kevin Barr is a generous
person who works hard to keep our land
beautiful for generations to come and is com-
mitted to our community. Therefore, it is fitting
and proper that we honor him here today.

HONORING ISABEL WILKERSON
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, Isabel
Wilkerson is one of the most important docu-
mentarians of African-American history in the
United States.
Ms. Wilkerson devoted fifteen years to re-
searching and writing The Warmth of Other
Suns, one of the most important accounts of
the Great Migration. From the 1910s to 1970s,
millions of African-Americans left the seg-
regated South in search of prosperity else-
where. Drawing inspiration from the migration
of her own parents from the rural South to
Washington, D.C., Ms. Wilkerson set out to
document stories from six decades of the con-
tinuous exodus of African-Americans from the
South. By sharing the very important but
underreported story of the six million people
who were once enslaved and their descend-
ants who fled the South for a better life, Ms
Wilkerson has helped our nation better under-
stand the dynamics of our society.
The Warmth of Other Suns is only one of
Ms. Wilkerson’s great achievements. She has
been a trailblazing author for decades. In the
1990s, she was Chicago Bureau Chief for The
New York Times. In 1994, she became the
first African-American woman to win a Pulitzer
Prize for journalism. Her Pulitzer-winning sto-
ries centered on the Midwestern flood of 1993
and the reality of life for a ten-year-old boy
from the South Side of Chicago. Since then,
she has written and taught at the highest lev-
els in the United States.
Today, at Rutgers University in Newark, Ms.
Wilkerson is delivering the prestigious Tanner
Lecture on Human Values. Her work has en-
hanced our nation’s understanding of human
rights and human values. I proudly honor Ms.
Wilkerson for her achievements and continued
success.

HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Thursday, April 25, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, in
recognition of April being Second Chance
Month, I introduce the Fairness in Federal Bu-

eral Bureau of Prisons (BOP) inmates are re-

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E490 April 25, 2019
Under current BOP rules, inmates are re-
quired to ‘‘pay a fee for health services of
$2.00 per health care visit.’’ While $2.00 may
seem insignificant, when inmates earn only
twelve to forty cents per hour on their work as-
signments, $2.00 is substantial. That money
could better be used to pay for the cost of ne-
cessities. Moreover, while copays can discour-
age unnecessary appointments, we should be
encouraging inmates to seek medical care be-
fore conditions become worse and more ex-
pensive for taxpayers. Preventative care is
much less expensive for the federal govern-
ment than costly treatment that could have
been avoided by a simple doctor’s visit earlier
in the process. That is what medical science
advises for Americans as a health practice.
Under current BOP rules, if an inmate is
found responsible through the Disciplinary
Hearing Process of having caused another in-
mate’s injury that required a medical visit, the
offending inmate is required to pay the $2.00
copay for the injured inmate’s visit. That rule
would not change under my bill.
Removing this unnecessary copay would
allow inmates to see a doctor and receive the
medical treatment they need, and would likely
save the federal government money in the
long run.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.

CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVER-

OF SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY
HON. ANDY KIM
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Ko-
rean School of Southern New Jersey.
Since its founding in 1979, the Korean
School of Southern New Jersey (KSSNJ) has
been central to developing and strengthening
ties in the Korean American community in
New Jersey. The school focuses on teaching
Korean cultural heritage and sharing it with the
local community.
KSSNJ provides various performing arts and
culture classes, organizes community events,
facilitates student competitions and offers ex-
citing summer camp programs for their stu-
dents. Over the years, the school has received
numerous accolades for their outstanding work
supporting Korean American youth, cultural
heritage and classroom achievement.
I am honored to be the first Asian American
Member of Congress to serve the state of
New Jersey, and the only Korean American to
be currently serving in Congress. I am proud
of the work that KSSNJ has done to bring the
Korean American community together in
Southern New Jersey, and to help develop the
next generation of Korean American leaders. I
wish them continued success in the many
years to come.

Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Miles Cua, Satya
Holla, Mohammad Khalil, Kunaal Jha, Chris
Conway, and Coach Scott Wiley from the
Science Academy of South Texas. These fine
young men and women are competing in the
2019 National Science Bowl Finals in Wash-
ington, D.C. Sunday, April 28, 2019.
Created by the Department of Energy’s Of-
fice of Science in 1991, the National Science
Bowl is one of the largest and most pres-
tigious academic competitions in the United
States. Over the course of the National
Science Bowl’s history, more than 290,000
students have participated. Each year, this
competition encourages thousands of students
to expand their understanding of mathematics
and science and pursue careers in such fields.
Our Science Academy of South Texas team
have put in the grit, sweat equity, and hard
work to get here, and I wish them all the best
as they face some of the best high school
teams in the nation. I am confident that they
will continue on to pursue even greater feats
and that this competition will teach them a
great deal about themselves and their abilities
to persevere regardless of the obstacles
ahead.

these students and their families in the United
States Congress, and I know all my col-
leagues in the House will join me in congratu-

REINTRODUCTION OF 21ST CEN-
TURY CIVILIAN CONSERVATION
CORPS ACT OF 2019
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, in honor of
the recent celebration of Arbor Day, I rise to
reintroduce my bill, the 21st Century Civilian
Conservation Corps Act of 2019.
In drafting this bill, I was inspired by the
original Civilian Conservation Corps, first es-
tablished by President Franklin Roosevelt in
1933 as part of his New Deal. This effort put
3 million young people between the ages of
18 to 28 to work. They planted 3.5 billion
trees, established more than 800 new parks,
improved or constructed over 90,000 acres of
campgrounds; blazed hiking trails, assembled
bridges, built rustic cabins and hiking shelters,
and mitigated the devastating impact of the
Dust Bowl across the Great Plains.
America is facing significant environmental
crisis from deforestation, soil, air, and water
pollution, loss of biodiversity, waste disposal,
climate change, and a depleted ozone. Luck-
ily, Americans are once again connecting the
dots between clean water, clean land, clean
air, and thriving regional ecosystems and
economies.
With recent attacks on programs that help
our environment, we must remember we don’t
have to choose between protecting our envi-
ronment and natural treasures and creating
jobs. We can do both at the same time.
Just Ohio and Michigan, alone, need 20 mil-
lion new trees planted to make up for the dev-
astation that the emerald ash borer and Asian
longhorned beetle have done to our forest
populations.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill and
its goal of putting Americans to work across
our country. Its efforts will once again revive
America’s natural landscape and enrich the
lives of millions of enrollees in the stewardship
of our natural resources forward.

COMMEMORATING THE 500 YEARS
OF THE FIRST VOYAGE AROUND
THE WORLD
HON. JENNIFFER GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN
OF PUERTO RICO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto Rico.
Madam Speaker, as the Co-Chair of the bipar-
tisan Congressional Friends of Spain Caucus,
I’d like to commemorate the 500th anniversary
of the first circumnavigation of the globe. On
April 26, 2019, the Spanish tall ship Juan
Sebastián de Elcano will arrive in Boston,
Massachusetts after stops in the U.S. ports in-
cluding in my district of San Juan, Puerto
Rico, as it continues its voyage to commemo-
rate Commissioned in 1928, Elcano is a train-
ing ship for the Spanish Royal Navy. This
Quincentennial presents an opportunity to re-
flect on the beginnings of our current era of
globalization. This first circumnavigation took
place between 1519 and 1522 under the or-
ders of Emperor Charles I of Spain. Started by
the distinguished Portuguese captain, Ferdi-
nand Magellan, this periplus was completed
after his death mid-way through the trip by the
Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano, the ship’s
name sake.
The first circumnavigation is a milestone
that transformed and connected the world.
This sea voyage had profound and lasting sci-
entific repercussions by proving that the earth
was in fact not only round but spherical. It not
only enhanced the total sum of human knowl-
edge but also promoted transnational
interconnectivity, thereby laying the foundation
for today’s world, defined by economic, polit-
ical, and cultural globalization.
The visit by Elcano to the United States as
part of the commemoration of this transcen-
dental event in the history of mankind, pro-
vides a great opportunity, not only to reflect on
this feat, but for strengthening the already ro-
bust ties that bind Spain and the United
States.
Therefore, as we salute the arrival of the tall
ship Juan Sebastián de Elcano, let’s take a
moment to commemorate the beginning of the
current era of globalization, the legacy and
great achievements of expeditionary trail-
blazers like Magellan and Elcano, and the
longstanding relationship between the United
States and Spain.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH
ANNIVERSARY OF VFIS
HON. SCOTT PERRY
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, April 25, 2019
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize VFIS, a division of Glatfelter Insur-
ance Group, as it celebrates 50 years of dedi-
cated service to our Nation’s fire and emer-
gency services.
Formerly known as Volunteer Firemen’s In-
surance Services, VFIS was established by
the late Arthur J. Glatfelter of York, Pennsyl-
vania. A Veteran of World War II, Mr.
Glatfelter was a U.S. Marine who served in
the Pacific. The values the Corps instilled in
him to serve our Country guided Mr. Glatfelter
throughout his professional career in sup-
porting the men and women of our Nation’s
fire and emergency service.
In 1969, Mr. Glatfelter, a well-established in-
surance agent, recognized a need for special-
ized insurance coverage for firefighters—a
coverage based on their motivations, their as-
pirations, their needs and the risks they were
willing to assume to protect others. He de-
signed a portfolio of comprehensive insurance
coverages that took all of these factors into
account. Fifty years later, these specialized
coverages remain the cornerstone on which
VFIS has based its insurance program for the
fire service.
VFIS is now the leading insurance provider
for emergency services organizations in the
Nation. These organizations include fire de-
partments, ambulance services, rescue
squads, 911 dispatch centers and more. VFIS
also provides an array of consulting services
and training programs focused on the oper-
ations of these organizations. Aligned with the
VFIS insurance program, they are designed to
safeguard our firefighters in their duties.
The values that defined Mr. Glatfelter re-
main embedded in the VFIS culture. Current
VFIS staff and key agents have over 1,000
years of emergency services experiences, rep-
resenting a significant level of giving back to
their communities. Many VFIS senior execu-
tives are involved in organizations that support
first responders—organizations such as the
Congressional Fire Services Institute, National
Fallen Firefighters Foundation, National Volun-
teer Fire Council, the National EMS Manage-
ment Foundation and the International Asso-
ciation of Fire Chiefs’ Foundation.
On April 27, 2019, VFIS will conduct a 50th
Anniversary gathering to celebrate this signifi-
cant milestone. The high standard of protec-
tion and service that VFIS has provided in
supporting our Nation’s fire and emergency
services for 50 years is a milestone worthy of
national recognition. In 1969, Mr. Glatfelter
pursued an idea to develop the best insurance
program possible to protect our nation’s fire
and emergency service providers. Fifty years
later, VFIS is the number one provider of in-
surance and risk management services to fire
and emergency service organizations in the
U.S. I hereby recognize VFIS for its 50 years
of dedication and commitment to serving those
who serve and protect our communities and
thank Arthur J. Glatfelter for his vision and
leadership in developing the VFIS Program.
Congratulations to VFIS on celebrating 50
years of dedicated service.
