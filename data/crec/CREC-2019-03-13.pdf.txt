CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF H.
LEON COMER, SR.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in celebration of the life of H.
Leon Comer, Sr., who passed away at
the age of 91 on Tuesday, March 5, 2019.
He was a man born of humble means
who never lost sight of where he came
from.
He was the son of the late John Stoll
Comer, Sr., and Annie Lee Roach
Comer, where he was one of seven sib-
lings. He was born in Rock Hill, South
Carolina, where he attended Oak Ridge
Elementary School and later served in
the United States Merchant Marines.
He was married to Francis Watkins
Comer for 64 years and had two chil-
dren, Brenda Comer Sutton and Leon
‘‘Chip’’ Comer, Jr.
Leon Comer believed in the value of
hard work and, after working as a man-
ager of a beer distributor in the greater
Rock Hill market for 12 years, he
founded Comer Distributing in 1971,
with only five employees, distributing
250,000 cases of beer, with only three
routes.
The original building, consisting of
only 5,000 square feet, was located on
Pendleton Street, and later expanded
to 17,000 square feet to a much larger
site on Carmel Road.
Comer Distributing expanded into
the greater Columbia market in 2012
and, 1 year later, added another 11,200
square feet of space. The company
opened in a two-story office building in
2018, along with an expanded ware-
house. The company has grown to 70
employees, providing 1.5 million cases
of a variety of brand-name beverages
each year.
Leon retired in 1990; however, over
the course of his lifetime, he served on
many boards, clubs, and commissions,
including the Rock Hill Economic De-
velopment Board; York County Natural
Gas Authority; York Masonic Lodge
#385; Hejaz Shriners; Winthrop Eagle
Club, where he was a founding member;
Ducks Unlimited; the South Carolina
Beer Wholesalers Association, serving
twice as chairman of the board; the
Waterfowl Association; the American
Legion; Frank Roach Post #34; the USC
Gamecock Club; and many more orga-
nizations and local groups.
Leon and his wife, Frances, were
longtime members of St. John’s United
Methodist Church, where he was very
active for many years. The lives that
have been positively affected by the
giving and donations to Christian
causes, such as the men’s shelters and
the Boys and Girls Clubs, will be re-
membered for years to come.
The company is now being run by his
son, Chip Comer, and the legacy of his
father can be summed up by the words
of Chip when he said the following:
‘‘My father is the epitome of what I
would always want to be, as he taught
me so many life lessons growing up.’’
Leon Comer left an indelible imprint
on the many lives that he touched, and
he will be remembered as a man who
epitomized the meaning of ‘‘true serv-
ice above self’’ and was a man who
dedicated his life to serving his faith,
his family, and his country.
May God bless Leon Comer and his
family.

FIX THEM BEFORE WE FLY THEM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise; and I rise today because
I love my country and because I love
the people, and I love their lives and I
care about them. And because I love
them and I care about them, I call
upon the President of the United
States of America to ground the 737
MAX 8.
This plane is unfit to fly. We have
had two go down in the last 6 months.
Two down within 6 months is two too
many.
We cannot put profits above people,
Mr. President. This is an opportunity
for you to exert your executive power
in a positive way on behalf of people
who fly these planes.
It is not about the pilots; it is about
the planes. These planes are unfit to
fly, and we cannot put profits above
people, and they are to be grounded
until they are fit.

SCOUTING ORGANIZATIONS PRO-
VIDE VALUABLE EXPERIENCES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, Scouting organizations
are pivotal in the lives of so many
American youth, and this week there
has been much to celebrate. Yesterday,
the Girl Scouts of the USA marked its
107th birthday, and tonight the Boy
Scouts of America will conclude its an-
nual report to the Nation.
Girl Scouts help girls develop into
the future leaders of our economy, our
communities, our country, and the
world by encouraging them to dream
big and work hard to achieve their
goals. In fact, many Congresswomen
have been Girl Scouts, and we saw
some Congresswomen deliver speeches
on this floor yesterday in honor of the
Girl Scouts building girls of courage,
confidence, and character for 107 years.
Mr. Speaker, I know firsthand the
positive impact that Scouting can have
on the life of a young person. I have
been actively involved with the Boy
Scouts of America since I was 11 years
old.
On May 17, 1977, I became an Eagle
Scout myself, as a member of Boy
Scout Troop 52 in Walker Township,
Pennsylvania. Over the years, I have
proudly held various leadership roles
with Boy Scout troops in Pennsyl-
vania, including two separate stints as
Scoutmaster for Troop 353 and presi-
dent of the Juniata Valley Boy Scout
Council. One of my greatest honors was
to witness 29 young men achieve the
rank of Eagle Scout during my tenure
as Scoutmaster.
Many Eagle Scouts will gather to-
night in the Capitol to conclude the an-
nual Report to the Nation delegation
trip. I am proud to be a part of the Ea-
gles on the Hill reception, and I look
forward to hearing from the Scouts.
Members of Congress and I will speak
about how Scouting positively im-
pacted our lives. And after the speech-
es, the Scouts will have a chance to
discuss their experience in Scouting as
a whole, as well as their time in the
Report to the Nation delegation.
Report to the Nation is an annual
event meant to connect some of
Scouting’s best and brightest with gov-
ernment officials and elected rep-
resentatives. Each year, 6 to 10 rep-
resentatives of the Boy Scouts meet
with senior government officials, in-
cluding the President and key congres-
sional leaders, with the goal of pro-
viding an update of what Scouts have
achieved over the past year. This also
allows members of the Federal Govern-
ment an opportunity to meet some of
the Nation’s brightest young Scouts.
The delegation spends between a week
and 10 days in Washington, D.C., con-
ducting meetings and touring the city.
The Report to the Nation delegation
stems from the congressional charter
of the Boy Scouts of America, dating
back to June 15, 1916, and represents
millions of Boy Scouts.
Mr. Speaker, I know that the Boy
Scouts of America and the Girl Scouts
of the USA both contribute to the spir-
it of this Nation and play an essential
role in educating our youth. These or-
ganizations build character; they help
young people become actively engaged
in their communities; and they pro-
mote serving others in ways big and
small. And that is something we can
all respect and admire.
f
A COMMUNITY IN PERIL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, today I
rise with great urgency to sound an
alarm because we have a community in
peril.
The Liberian community in Min-
nesota and around the Nation is deal-
ing with a crisis of our very own mak-
ing. When the DED, Deferred Enforced
Departure, program expires on March
31, thousands of our Liberian friends
and neighbors will be at risk of losing
their jobs and their homes and being
deported back to a nation that they no
longer know.
Thousands of Liberians settled in the
United States in the 1990s and early
2000s when their country was dev-
astated by civil wars. My friend Louise
Stevens was one of them. She was a
woman with a dream of a good life who
worked hard to get an education and
worked hard to get a good job; and be-
cause of a civil war she had nothing to
do with, she had the courage and brav-
ery to flee her home and start over in
America.
She slept on a mattress in a friend’s
living room for over a year. She and
her kids shared two rooms for another
year. And when President Clinton in-
troduced the DED program in 1999, she
was finally able to work without fear
of being deported.
She went to Boston Scientific and,
with her education and work ethic, was
able to get a good job and start a ca-
reer that spanned 18 years. Now, she is
over 60 years old, and she could lose ev-
erything once again.
‘‘The world took everything from
me,’’ she told us. ‘‘Now I have a home;
I have a job; I have a hospital to go to;
I have friends; and Minnesota is my
home. America is my home. I can’t
wrap my head around a piece of paper
telling me we don’t care; you can’t live
here anymore.’’
Another of my Liberian constituents,
Michael, told us that ‘‘I am almost 50.
My friends in Liberia are either dead or
living outside of the country. If I am
sent back, I will have accomplished
nothing. My whole life is here, and this
is my home.’’
Another, Abdi Mohamed, who is
afraid of losing his brother: ‘‘I cannot
begin to imagine the nightmare this
will create in my community,’’ he said.
‘‘I am not ready to let my bond with
my brother go. We love to go shopping
at the Mall of America. Dave and Bust-
ers is so much fun together. I am not
ready for this.’’
Mr. Speaker, we can do something
about this. We can stop the nightmare
from becoming a reality. We can legis-
late a fix.
It is time to act. This is what we are
here to do: to put people before politics
and make a real difference in our com-
munities.
Our Liberian neighbors are friends;
they are workers; and they are tax-
payers. They have played by the rules;
they have worked exceptionally hard;
and they have thrived in good jobs. If
we lose them, we will be losing our
workforce; we will be losing our com-
munity; and we will be losing our fam-
ily.
We have 18 days to act, 18 days to do
something to make sure that our Libe-
rian community will never have to
spend another sleepless night won-
dering if the world will take everything
away from them once again.

THANKING OUR FARMER
COOPERATIVES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, in
many parts of my district and all
across Kansas, farmer cooperatives are
the foundation of a modernized and
productive agriculture industry. For
decades, co-ops have been farmers’ pri-
mary business partner, supplier, and
grain buyer. Memberships have been
passed down from one generation to an-
other, and relationships have been life-
long.
Today, our farmer co-ops are as
strong and as important as ever. In the
far reaches of my district, the co-ops
provide feed, fertilizer, and fuel to
farmers.
As times and needs have changed, so
too have our co-ops. From online plat-
forms for account statements and pur-
chasing to precision technology that
reduces fertilizer inputs and improves
soil productivity, innovation has been
necessary and vital to the co-ops’ suc-
cess.
Kansas farmer co-ops are responsible
for more than 4,600 jobs and $1.1 billion
in total economic impact, statewide.
These member-owned organizations
have been and will continue to be vital
to the continued growth and success of
the agriculture industry.
Farmers are facing steep headwinds,
and organizations like the co-ops are
important in helping producers navi-
gate through uncertainty in the indus-
try.
We often take the time to thank our
farmers, but it is also important we
thank the hardworking men and

women of our farmer co-ops for the val-
uable time and expertise they put into
supporting our farmers and our agri-
culture industry.
CELEBRATING NATIONAL AG DAY
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in celebration of National Ag
Day, a celebration of our Nation’s old-
est and most important industry and
the hardworking men and women who
put food on our table, clothes on our
back, and fuel in our cars.
The number of people in agriculture
today is but a fraction of what it was
100 years ago, but the impact of today’s
agriculture industry is unprecedented.
Today’s farmer feeds about 165 people,
and agriculture remains this country’s
number one export.
In Kansas, agriculture accounts for
nearly half the State’s economy, and,
in my district, that number is more
than 60 percent. For many rural com-
munities, farming and ranching is the
sole economic driver.
Kansas is the national leader in agri-
culture, ranking first in the production
of grain sorghum, second in the produc-
tion of wheat, third for cattle, and
fourth in the production of sunflowers.
In fact, Kansas is second in the Nation
for the total number of acres farmed.
b 1015
Winters like the one we are currently
experiencing at home have highlighted
the time and dedication farmers and
ranchers have to their land and ani-
mals. In Kansas, farmers with live-
stock are working around the clock to
ensure the animals are healthy, warm,
and well fed. That means enduring sub-
zero windchills, blizzard-like condi-
tions, and middle-of-the-night checks.
While agriculture has become a tar-
get of environmentalists who want to
discontinue life as we know it in Kan-
sas, I am here today to testify to the
great work farmers and ranchers have
done to protect and improve our air,
land, and water. Farmers are the origi-
nal conservationists, and continue to
find ways to do more with less, while
protecting our most valuable natural
resources.
National Ag Day is our opportunity
to celebrate farmers and ranchers,
highlight the impact they have on our
communities and country, and remem-
ber the thousands of products made
possible by their hard work.
Back home, it is a day to introduce
thousands of grade school kids to the
agriculture industry with fun things
like how to milk a cow, gathering eggs,
and even flying drones.
I encourage Members to join me
today in celebration of National Agri-
culture Day and take time to thank a
farmer.
f
HONORING JOHN KILZER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today I
learned that John Kilzer, a friend, an
important figure in Memphis and in
the music community, passed away.
John Kilzer was 62 years old. He was
born in Jackson, Tennessee, up the
road from Memphis, but he lived most
of his life in Memphis.
He was the epitome of what Memphis
is about. A lot of times people in Mem-
phis call us grit and grinders, and the
city is the city of grit and grind. It
comes from the basketball team, the
Grizzlies.
John’s life was Memphis and John’s
life was grit and grind. He was a high
school All-American basketball player
who went to the University of Mem-
phis, then Memphis State, and played
basketball. Didn’t play it that well, but
he played it. He was on the team; a
good outside shooter and a scrapper.
He got interested in other things and
he had some demons with him too.
Those demons came along maybe from
his father, who was an alcoholic, and it
caused John to have problems with
abuse of drugs and alcohol as well. It
interfered with his basketball career,
interfered with his music life, but he
never let it keep him down. He came
back. He came back every chance he
could.
He came back as a musician who was
signed by David Geffen, had two al-
bums by Geffen, one song that made
the top ten, and songs recorded by
Maria Muldaur, Rosanne Cash, and oth-
ers.
He became a minister and he had a
series of ministries in St. John’s
United Methodist Church in Memphis.
It was called Recovery Ministry, where
he had other musicians come and join
him, and they performed for folks who
were having trouble with addiction,
gave them a concert every Friday and
helped them on the road to recovery.
He never forgot people, especially lit-
tle people. He made a big difference.
For a man from Jackson, Tennessee,
who was a tall guy who played basket-
ball, to become a musician and become
a minister and a writer: quite a life.
He was influenced by Reverend
James Lawson, a hero of the civil
rights movement, whose simple pres-
ence at a Calvary Church Lenten serv-
ice influenced John to get back into
ministry.
He had a ministry degree and a Ph.D.
in ministry as well that he got in Lon-
don, England.
He was influenced in music—which
he dabbled with but wasn’t very good—
by Teenie Hodges, a guitarist for Al
Green. He came over to see the basket-
ball team and saw a guitar in John’s
room. He took up with John and taught
him the finer points of music, song-
writing, and guitar playing, and John
did good at that, but what John did
best was helping his fellow human
being.
He never gave up. He always saw
hope and opportunity. And he thought
in universal terms.
So when I read about my friend,
John, dying, the first thing I did was go
around to try to find his CD in my
condo. Most of my CDs are in Memphis,
about 1,000 to 1, but I looked around
and couldn’t find John’s CD. It must be
in Memphis.
So I thought, maybe I can talk to my
friend Alexa, see if Alexa can help me.
I said, ‘‘Alexa, play me some John
Kilzer.’’ And Amazon Music had John
Kilzer, about eight or nine songs in
there, including a song he wrote with
Kirk Whalum, a great saxophonist and
a legend in Memphis and in the music
scene, called ‘‘Until We’re All Free’’.
We are not all free until we are all free.
It is a great song.
So if you have a chance, if you have
got Alexa as a friend, ask her to play
you some John Kilzer. It is good music.

CONGRESS MUST MEET ITS
CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today with a heavy heart as another in-
dividual has lost her life on U.S. High-
way 12 in my home State of Minnesota,
in fact, right in my neighborhood.
U.S. Highway 12 is the road we drive
to get to and from our hometown of
Delano, Minnesota. This is one of the
most dangerous stretches of road in
our State. The highway has actually
been called the ‘‘Corridor of Death.’’
On March 2, 2019, Marleena Anna
Dieterich, an 18-year-old from Delano,
Minnesota, lost her life in another
crash on this highway.
Marleena was a student at Delano
High School, a member of our home-
town, and a young life with so much
promise. We lost her far too soon.
Today I rise to remember the life of
Marleena, to remember that she was an
honor student, a black belt in
Taekwondo, and was planning to major
in biomedical sciences and minor in
premed. Her life held endless promise.
This accident, like so many on U.S.
Highway 12, was tragic and senseless.
Over the years, some improvements
have been made to portions of U.S.
Highway 12, but until massive improve-
ments are made to the most dangerous
stretch of this highway, tragic acci-
dents will continue to occur.
Since the beginning of 2019, just 2
months, 14 crashes have already oc-
curred on that stretch of the highway
leading into Delano in Minnesota’s
Sixth Congressional District. More
must be done, and quickly.
While we are committed to working
with the Minnesota Department of
Transportation and the Highway 12
Safety Coalition to ensure that Min-
nesotans can travel safely and securely
on this road, I am inviting our Trans-
portation Secretary Chao to visit us
and see firsthand some of our most des-
perate transportation needs in Min-
nesota.

cate and direct Federal funds to build,

CONGRATULATIONS TO THE MINNESOTA
WHITECAPS
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, this
March, during the National Hockey
League’s Gender Equality Month, I
want to congratulate the Minnesota
Whitecaps for making it to the Na-
tional Women’s Hockey League play-
offs.
Not everyone can play professional
sports, but everyone can participate at
some level. Sports are a great training
ground for life. Lessons in sportsman-
ship, teamwork, how to handle adver-
sity are all important to the develop-
ment of productive, contributing citi-
zens in a civil society.
Professional women athletes play a
large role in the development of girls
hockey in communities across the
country, but especially the Minnesota
hockey community.
We are lucky to have inspiring play-
ers turn coaches that mentor the next
generation of female hockey players
and great Americans.
I know the entire Minnesota hockey
world is proud of the Whitecaps.
Congratulations on your success, and
good luck in the playoffs.
HEALTHPARTNERS RECOGNIZED FOR SERVING
THE UNDERSERVED
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize HealthPartners for
receiving the 2019 CMS Health Equity
Award from the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services.
This award recognizes organizations
that demonstrate an exceptional com-
mitment to serving the most under-
served individuals among us.
HealthPartners has locations
throughout Minnesota’s Sixth Congres-
sional District, which I am honored to
represent in this Congress.
HealthPartners is committed to
eliminating healthcare disparities for
those with language, cultural, and
other barriers.
I am pleased to congratulate this
outstanding company for receiving this
well-deserved award.
I hope other healthcare providers will
take note of the small changes that
can make a big difference in elimi-
nating bias in the distribution of
healthcare services.
f
SUPPORTING STATE AND LOCAL
TAX DEDUCTION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New York (Mr. ZELDIN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, tax day is
approaching on April 15, and I again
rise to state my support for the State
and local tax deduction.
There were many positive aspects to
the tax bill that I voted against.
I support reducing the corporate tax
rate, but it should not have been done
by increasing personal taxes on any
hardworking middle-income Long Is-
lander in my district.
The $10,000 cap that was made to the
SALT deduction was a punch in the gut
to middle-class taxpayers in my dis-
trict.
There were positive aspects, as I said,
of the tax bill: expanding the medical
expense deduction, preserving edu-
cation and student deductions, dou-
bling the child tax credit, the AMT
changes.
And as I stated, changing the cor-
porate tax rate helps make the United
States more competitive globally, to
improve our business climate, to help
create more jobs, but it should not be
done by raising taxes on the personal
income side.
I have been working closely with col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to ad-
dress this issue. I have been working
with Democratic Representative JOSH
GOTTHEIMER of New Jersey. I cosponsor
legislation between PETER KING, a Re-
publican, and TOM SUOZZI, a Democrat,
H.R. 257. NITA LOWEY introduced a bill
that I cosponsor, H.R. 188.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my col-
leagues in this Chamber to work to-
gether to address this important issue,
because it is important to deliver tax
relief to all Americans.
Now, I do have an important mes-
sage, though, to the Governor of New
York, the mayor of New York City,
those who are running State and local
governments in States like mine. The
reason why our State and local tax de-
duction was as high as it was is be-
cause our State and local taxes are as
high as they are.
So everybody needs to look in the
mirror and figure out what we can do
to do our part, because all levels of
government need to deliver tax relief.
My home State of New York has
some of the highest taxes in the entire
country. It is ranked as the second
worst State in the entire Nation to do
business. You couple that with the loss
of the SALT deduction, and it has only
sped up the amount of businesses and
individuals who are choosing to leave
our State.
It was very upsetting to see an effort
by elected officials, some here in Con-
gress, others in the State legislature to
push away 25,000 good-paying Amazon
jobs that would have been coming to
Long Island City.
Now, we all must do our part. The
State and local tax deduction has been
around in some way since, you could
say, Abraham Lincoln’s administra-
tion. He used the State and local tax
deduction to help keep this union to-
gether and fight the Civil War.
It was a tough debate a little over a
year ago now when the tax law was
passed through both Chambers and
signed by the President, but next
month, as April 15 approaches and peo-
ple have to pay their taxes, they are
going to be seeing less in their return,
many will be seeing less in their return
where I am from. Some will be getting
more, and that is great.
I didn’t oppose this bill because all of
my constituents were going to see a
tax increase. It was that too many
were going to see a tax increase.
Now, all, when they are getting their
tax return need to understand that
throughout the year, money was added
to their paycheck because of a change
in the way that taxes were calculated
with withholdings through the year. So
that is something else to factor in
when trying to figure out the impact of
the tax bill. Again, some people will be
seeing less that they owe, others will
be seeing more.
In this Chamber, in the halls of the
New York State capitol, in the halls of
State capitols everywhere, in city
halls, in county and town governments
all throughout America, we all need to
do our part to deliver tax relief.
b 1030
Because at all levels of government,
really, it is not a revenue issue that
has been leading to the situation that
we face as a country and in our local
governments. It has been an expendi-
ture issue.
Whether you could save a dollar, a
million dollars, a billion dollars, wher-
ever you can find money to save, we
need to get better at how we tax and
spend the people’s money. We need to
spend it as if it is our own.
Mr. Speaker, there is a message here
to my colleagues in this Chamber. I
ask for their support of this legisla-
tion, multiple bills that have been in-
troduced. I make that plea to the Sen-
ate, to the administration, and also to
all those representatives of State and
local governments responsible for the
fact that the reason our deduction was
as high as it was, was because our
State and local taxes were as high as
they were. But we need to do our part
here in this Chamber.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FORMER
CONGRESSMAN RALPH HALL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. OLSON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, on March 7
of this year, 6 days ago, we lost our col-
league Ralph Hall.
Ralph’s journey among us here in
Congress and our world started on May
3, 1923, in a town called Fate, Texas.
Never in American history has a town
of birth been more appropriate for a
man than Fate, Texas. Ralph’s life was
all about fate, great faith, and God.
As fate would have it, Ralph left Fate
and moved to Rockwall when he was 3
years old. He started working there at
a local convenience store.
As fate would have it, guess who
showed up? Bonnie and Clyde, the noto-
rious killers on a rampage throughout
Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, that part
of our country. They gave Ralph a 25-
cent tip—a quarter—big money in
those days. He was so excited, he
showed his boss the quarter and no-
ticed a newspaper lying there on the

floor. Whose picture was on the front of
that paper? Bonnie and Clyde.
He told his boss, ‘‘They just came
here. They are in Rockwall. That is
their car.’’ His boss called the local
sheriff. Ralph couldn’t hear the con-
versation, but the sheriff said some-
thing to the effect of, ‘‘Thanks for call-
ing about Bonnie and Clyde. I’ve got
two stray dogs I’ve got to catch. Once
I get those dogs, I’m going after Bonnie
and Clyde.’’
After the surprise attack on Pearl
Harbor, Ralph joined our Navy to fly
naval aircraft. He went to Pensacola,
Florida, for his first training.
As fate would have it, he met a Hall
of Fame baseball player, Ted Williams
of the Boston Red Sox, the last man to
hit over .400 in a season. Knowing he
had Ted on his baseball team, Ralph
found a young Army sergeant and said:
‘‘Hey, son, I want to bet you my whole
paycheck on a baseball game, Navy
versus Army.’’
The day of the game, Ralph knocked
on Ted’s door. Ted answered with a
fishing pole and some gear to go fish-
ing. Ralph said, ‘‘You have to play
baseball and beat Army.’’ Ted said, ‘‘I
came here to learn to fly, defend Amer-
ica, and then fish.’’ Ralph held the
game up so Ted could go AWOL, absent
without leave, and go fishing.
Of course, that night, Ralph had to
go home to his queen, his beloved Mary
Ellen, and tell her, ‘‘Honey, I have just
lost my entire paycheck betting on a
baseball game with the Army.’’
Ralph got out of flight school and
went to war. He flew the F6F Hellcat
on aircraft carriers. Now, I was a naval
aviator, and I have to tell you, those
guys were crazy, crazy, crazy coura-
geous. Right now, if you land on an air-
craft carrier, you have what is called
the meatball. This ball gives you
course and glide slope. In those days,
they had guys with paddles.
Ralph said his proudest achievement
in naval aviation during the war was to
make sure on his record book that his
takeoffs were the same number as his
landings.
As fate would have it, once again,
Ralph came home to Rockwall, Texas,
to become a lawyer. The local county
judge retired, so there was a vacancy.
People said, ‘‘Ralph, you should run
our county. File for election.’’ Ralph
didn’t want to play politics. That
wasn’t his business. But driving home,
he said, ‘‘You know what? I will just
apply, maybe be there for just a couple
months and go back home to my law-
yer job.’’ He filed 1 minute before the
deadline that year, 1 minute.
He was driving home. The local radio
was booming: ‘‘Ralph Hall, running for
county judge.’’ Guess who was outside
his home, waiting with an angered look
on her face? His queen, Mary Ellen.
That fate got Ralph going into public
service and got Ralph here on Capitol
Hill.
As fate would have it, when America
goes back to the Moon sometime in the
next couple years, they are going to do
that because of Ralph Hall.
God bless Ralph Hall. As our dear
friend Gene Cernan said: May you al-
ways have fair winds and following
seas. You shot for your Moon. You are
still among the stars.
God bless Ralph Hall.
f
NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, as a third-
generation farmer from California’s
San Joaquin Valley, I wish everyone a
happy National Agriculture Day, some-
thing that we do throughout our coun-
try.
I am proud, obviously, to represent
the heart of California’s San Joaquin
Valley. But our agricultural produc-
tiveness throughout the country, be-
ginning with the very origins of the
history of the United States, has truly
been one of the tremendous assets that
we have had.
We are home to the most productive
agricultural land in the world, not only
throughout the country, but in Cali-
fornia. Our farmers, our dairymen and
-women, our ranchers, and our live-
stock folks feed the country. I have
often said that our food security, that
dinner that we have on our dinner
table every night, is a part of Amer-
ica’s national food security.
As a senior member of the House Ag-
riculture Committee, I am proud that
we delivered a comprehensive farm bill
last year. Now it is part of our job to
ensure that we implement that farm
bill as a safety net for agriculture
throughout the country. But it is also
a safety net for those who are working
poor, those who are, unfortunately, re-
cipients of food assistance programs
and the school lunch and the school
breakfast programs. So the farm bill
does a great deal to help all Americans.
This year, the Agriculture Com-
mittee will work to ensure that those
promises we made in the farm bill will
be implemented in the way we in-
tended. The subcommittee that I chair,
the Subcommittee on Livestock and
Foreign Agriculture, will be at the van-
guard of that effort.
Today, on National Agriculture Day,
let us thank those who grow America’s
food and fiber and put it on America’s
dinner table every night. I am talking
about the farmers, the dairymen and
-women, and the farmworkers, who,
through their hard work and the fruits
of their labor, make this all come to-
gether.
VISAS FOR CITIZENS OF PORTUGAL
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, soon, the
Portuguese Caucus will be reintro-
ducing legislation that is important for
not only the United States, but for our
ally Portugal. We will be introducing
bipartisan legislation that will allow
citizens of Portugal to be eligible for
what is called the E–1 treaty trader
visa and the E–2 treaty investors visa.
Portugal is one of the United States’
oldest allies and a close economic part-
ner. The United States became Por-
tugal’s largest trading partner outside
the European Union in 2015. Bilateral
trade reached $4.2 billion in 2015, a 30
percent increase from 5 years ago.
However, because Portugal did not
have a bilateral investor treaty with
the United States before joining the
European Union, they are one of only
five European Union countries whose
citizens are not eligible for the E–1 and
E–2 visas.
This is long overdue. It is good for
the United States; it is good for Por-
tugal; and it is good for increased eco-
nomic activity between both countries.
It is bipartisan. Hopefully, this year,
we will be successful in implementing
these E–1 and E–2 treaty investor visas.
70TH ANNIVERSARY OF NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ORGANIZATION
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, this year
marks the 70th anniversary of the
founding of NATO, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
We helped create NATO, the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, not only
to protect our European allies, but to
protect our interests. For 70 years, it
has done just that, a remarkable suc-
cess.
Next month, in April, we have in-
vited the Secretary General of NATO
to come address a bipartisan joint ses-
sion of Congress to take assessment of
and to commend our NATO partners,
along with the United States, for a job
well done.
How do you say a job well done? Well,
after World War II, over the last 70
years, this is the longest peacetime pe-
riod in Europe in 1,000 years. Think
about that. The last 70 years has been
the longest peacetime period in Europe
in more than 1,000 years.
NATO has been one of the corner-
stones that has created that peace divi-
dend, being an absolute and critical
barrier against the aggression of the
Soviet Union and other totalitarian
states, being there for the fall of the
Iron Curtain. NATO’s relevance today
is just as important as it was then.

Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, our

Pennsylvania, help make our commu-

am proud to recognize one such busi-
ness, McCaffrey’s Food Markets, which
was recently named Business of the

McCaffrey’s Food Markets and the
McCaffrey family are both noted for
their generosity to our community and
are noted supporters of the American
Red Cross, St. Mary’s Medical Center,
the American Cancer Society, and the
9/11 Garden of Reflection, among many
other organizations and memorials.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud McCaffrey’s
Food Markets, the McCaffrey family,
and all their amazing employees for
their investment in our community
and their entrepreneurship.
I also thank Bill Sheffer and Beverly
Dimler of the Newtown Business Asso-
ciation for all their leadership in our
community.
RECOGNIZING BUCKS COUNTY ASSOCIATION FOR
THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a nonprofit or-
ganization in Bucks County, Pennsyl-
vania, that is seeking to assist college
students as they enter the workforce.
The Bucks County Association for the
Blind and Visually Impaired, based in
Newtown, recently teamed up with
Bucks County Community College to
collect attire for college students.
Mr. Speaker, a critical component to
ensuring the success of recent college
graduates, and those who will be grad-
uating in the future, is making sure
that they are equipped with the re-
sources they need to succeed. I applaud
the work of the Bucks County Associa-
tion for the Blind and Visually Im-
paired, especially the organization’s
executive director, Anne Marie Hyer,
for her service.
I also thank Bucks County Commu-
nity College for its collaboration with
this dynamic organization and so many
others in our community.
HONORING JOHN POPRIK
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it
is with a heavy heart that I rise today
to honor the life and memory of a very,
very special member of the Bucks
County community, John Poprik,
whom we recently lost.
Born in Philadelphia, John attended
Father Judge High School and Drexel
University, where he graduated in 1970
with a degree in accounting. He was a
respected business executive, having
served as the CFO of Better Material
Corp. before becoming the CFO of
Sommer Maid Creamery.
John was truly dedicated to making
our community a better place through
public service. He served on the North-
ampton Bucks County Water and
Sewer Authority, the Bucks County
Drug and Alcohol Commission, and
Pennsylvania’s Office of Unemploy-
ment Compensation Board of Review.
More than anything, John was a
dedicated family man. He spent some
of his most treasured moments with
his five grandchildren, his wife, Pat,
and his children.
I extend my deepest condolences to
his beloved wife of 50 years, my dear
friend Pat Poprik, and their sons, Brad
and Matt. May John, a good and decent
and honorable man, enjoy his eternal
reward for a life well-lived.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. WALTZ) for 5 minutes.
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, each year
in the month of March, our Nation
takes time to celebrate Women’s His-
tory Month and to recognize the impor-
tant role women have played in our
personal, local, national, and world his-
tory.
We have made progress elevating
women throughout our society, but it
is not enough. There is still more work
to be done here at home and around the
world.
Women play a critical role in the his-
tory of every American.
As the son of a single mother who
worked multiple jobs while putting
herself through night school, I owe ev-
erything I am to this strong, inde-
pendent, American woman. She and
millions of other women like her
blazed the trail for me, for today’s
young women, and, particularly, for
my 15-year-old daughter, Anderson.
I am proud to be raising a young
woman at a time where we have seen
tremendous gains for women in our Na-
tion.
I am proud to serve alongside a his-
toric 102 women here in this Congress,
the 116th Congress, including trail-
blazers like MARTHA MCSALLY, the first
female fighter pilot in Congress, and
numerous other Republican colleagues
in the House who were the first women
to represent their districts: Represent-
atives like LIZ CHENEY and ELISE
STEFANIK, who are working diligently
to ensure more female candidates have
the resources they need to compete in
our election system, and countless oth-
ers who inspire me.
As these national role models con-
tinue to be important, it is also critical
to recognize the important role local
heroes and local women have in our
communities and our Nation, including
many from my own district in Florida.
That is why each week this month I
will be honoring local women who have
had or are having an important impact
in our community, women like:
Alice Scott Abbott, a Flagler County
resident of the early 1900s who worked
with the national women’s suffrage
movement and, following the ratifica-
tion of the 19th Amendment, fervently
employed her fellow Flagler County
women to register and participate in
the 1920 November election;
Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, who
founded the Volusia County School
that would later become Bethune-
Cookman University. She was a na-
tional leader on issues related to civil
rights, to education, to women and
young people until her death in 1955.
Mr. Speaker, as these local heroes ex-
emplify, women and their contribu-
tions are critical to our success as a
nation, but I also believe their strength
is an essential part of our national se-
curity.
As a Green Beret who operated all
over the world, I know firsthand where
women thrive in business, where they
thrive in civil society, in politics, and
in government, extremism does not.
Where women thrive, extremism fails.
As an Afghan elder once told me dur-
ing one of my combat tours, he shared
with me his secret weapon in defeating
the Taliban. It wasn’t a weapon or a
missile or some type of other secret de-
vice. It was his teenage daughters,
whom he had sent to India to be edu-
cated. He looked at me and said: This
is our secret weapon to defeat extre-
mism.
And I will quote for you, Mr. Speak-
er, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning
young girl who was shot in the face for
attending school, Malala Yousafzai.
She said: ‘‘Extremists have shown what
frightens them most: a girl with a
book.’’
So this Women’s History Month must
serve as a reminder that as a nation we
have a responsibility to empower
women who participate in every aspect
of our society—not only for the better-
ment of America, but also as an exam-
ple for the world.
So thank you to the women of my
district, our Nation, and the world who
worked to make their communities a
better place for us all.
DAYTONA BIKE WEEK
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, This week
is Daytona Bike Week, where my dis-
trict welcomes nearly 300,000 avid mo-
torcyclists for our community’s 78th
annual celebration of liberty, freedom,
and two-wheeled, motorized muscle. No
other event comes close to matching
our combination of bikes, Florida
beaches, sun, and fun.
It all started in January 1937, on a
3.2-mile race course running along the
world’s most famous beach—Daytona
Beach. Riders first headed south on the
paved roadway of Route A1A, turned
left onto the beach, then raced north
on the sand until turning back onto the
pavement at a spot now marked by a
favorite local restaurant named
Racing’s North Turn. Then, the riders
did it again and again and again for 200
miles.
This was the birth of the famed Day-
tona 200 motorcycle race and the Bike
Week that now surrounds it. Since
then, only World War II has inter-
rupted these annual festivities. Today,
the Daytona 200 headlines Bike Week
as a spectacular finale in the famed
Daytona International Speedway.
Don’t miss the week’s other high-
adrenaline racing, too. The American
Flat Track series opens its season this
week, and the Daytona Supercross is
back again, bigger and better than
ever.
If you are unsure of where to start,
try the brand-new official Bike Week
Welcome Center, located in One Day-
tona.

REJECT THE PRESIDENT’S
BUDGET
(Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Trump’s budget landed with a
thud on the backs of working Ameri-
cans this week.
Its message is quite simple: this ad-
ministration will reward wealth with
one hand and target working families
with another.
To this President, avoiding the es-
tate tax for wealthy heirs is an entitle-
ment, but the healthcare of everyday
Americans is expendable.
To this President, carried interest on
passive income is a worthy tax benefit
for executives, while a livable min-
imum wage for a working parent is a
burden we cannot afford.
To this President, a lengthy record of
felony convictions won’t deny your tax
credit for a private jet, but a convic-
tion for misdemeanor drug possession
could cost you the roof over your head.
A budget that puts Americans first
doesn’t deem millions of Americans un-
worthy.
A budget that puts Americans first
doesn’t starve them of housing, of
healthcare, and of food because their
President counts stock market gains as
more important than our common hu-
manity.
But putting Americans first has
never been the fundamental policy of
this administration. It has always been
to draw a bright line between the
wealthy and the striving.
I stand to reject this budget.
f
HONORING THE LIFE OF MAYOR
BETTY WALKER
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor Mayor Betty Walker of
Chiefland, Florida, who passed away on
Monday, February 25.
Mayor Walker served the citizens of
Chiefland as an elected city commis-
sioner for over 15 years and as mayor
and vice mayor for 11 of those years.
Betty Walker was the first African
American female elected official for
the city of Chiefland. She was a great
leader. She loved her community im-
mensely. She advocated for the police
and fire departments and the mainte-
nance departments as well.
Mayor Walker had recently retired
after spending almost 40 years helping
adults with intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities.
She truly loved the people of
Chiefland. She was passionate about
parks and recreation and always had a
vision for her city.
Mayor Walker leaves behind a rich
legacy that not many can match.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in hon-
oring a life well lived and a community
leader who will be missed by many,
Mayor Betty Walker of Chiefland.
YEMEN
(Ms. GABBARD asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, today
in Yemen, there are millions of Yemeni
people who are on the brink of death
from famine and disease, lack of access
to food and water, basic medicine and
healthcare.
Thousands of Yemeni civilians have
died in this genocidal war being waged
by Saudi Arabia with support from the
United States. They have been living
under the looming threat of death at a
moment’s notice.
This must end. Not another day can
go by with U.S. support for this geno-
cidal war.
Saudi Arabia is not our ally. They
spend billions of dollars spreading the
Wahhabi-Salafist ideology that fuels
terrorist organizations like ISIS and
al-Qaida. They take the weapons that
they get from the United States and
provide them to al-Qaida.
Enough is enough.
Mr. Speaker, today, the Senate is
taking an important vote, and I urge
my colleagues in the Senate to hear
the pleas of the Yemeni people who are
begging for their lives. Vote today to
end the unconstitutional U.S. support
for Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war in
Yemen.

HONORING FRED HILSENRATH
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise in honor of the life and legacy of a
friend and Holocaust survivor, Fred
Hilsenrath, who recently passed away
at the age of 90.
Fred was only 4 years old when Ad-
olph Hitler took over as chancellor of
Germany.
After spending years in concentra-
tion camps throughout Romania, fac-
ing death, witnessing some of the most
heinous and grotesque atrocities the
world has seen, Fred and his family
were finally rescued by a Jewish Rus-
sian soldier.
With his new-found freedom, Fred
moved to the United States to finish
his education in electrical engineering.
After meeting his wife, Eleanor, Fred
moved first to San Francisco and, fi-
nally, to retire in Fairfield Bay, Ar-
kansas. Here, he wanted that slower
pace of life.
In his later years, Fred advocated to
young people, ‘‘Find your passion early
and pursue it, even if adversity comes
your way.’’
He was a role model and friend to
many across the State of Arkansas,
and I extend my condolences, respect,
and affection to his friends, family, and
loved ones.

Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
am here to represent the residents of
Arizona’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict. I work for them.
Our constituents sent us here to
practice good government and to fight
for their values and interests, so I am
upset with the President’s recent budg-
et request.
A budget is an expression of our val-
ues, and this budget further proves how
out of touch Donald Trump is with real
American families.
This budget ransacks Medicaid,
Medicare, and affordable healthcare. It
makes it harder for Americans to have
access to quality healthcare.
This budget abandons hungry fami-
lies who are struggling to make ends
meet. It fails farmers and rural com-
munities. It pushes affordable college
further out of reach, making it harder
for students to attend college. And this
budget demands billions for a wasteful,
ineffective wall.
We need to have a budget that
prioritizes working families and not
large corporations.
We need to invest more in our edu-
cation system and invest more in our
young people, not less.
What the President has laid out does
not accomplish the goals or values of
American families, and I reject this
budget.

RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE
FORGOTTEN AND LEFT BEHIND
(Mr. COX of California asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in support of the Equality
Act.
Too often in our policy debates, it is
our rural communities that are forgot-
ten and left behind. And for LGBTQ
people living in rural America, this is
no different.
If you want to live and work and
raise your family in rural America, you
should be able to have that choice, but
it is unfortunately the case today that
rural LGBTQ families are denied op-
portunities in housing, employment,
and healthcare access.
While in California we have com-
prehensive laws to protect LGBTQ peo-
ple and protect them against discrimi-
nation, this is not the case everywhere.
That is why we need bills like the
Equality Act.
This bill would take important steps
to protect every LGBTQ family from
discrimination in housing, employ-
ment, and financing.
It will help ensure that every family
that chooses to live in rural America
can fully participate in our society free
from fear of discrimination simply be-
cause of who they are or who they love.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is recognized
for 1 hour.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL),
pending which I yield myself such time
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, on
Monday, the Rules Committee met and
reported a rule, House Resolution 208,
providing for the consideration of H.
Con. Res. 24, a resolution expressing
the sense of Congress that the report of
Special Counsel Mueller should be
made available to the public and to
Congress.
The rule provides for consideration of
the legislation under a closed rule.
The rule self-executes two amend-
ments to simply clarify that the reso-
lution is calling for the release of the
special counsel’s findings in addition to
any report.
b 1215
It provides 1 hour of debate equally
divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee.
Finally, the rule provides standard
recess procedures for the period of
March 15 through March 22.
Mr. Speaker, when the Justice De-
partment named the special counsel for
the Russia investigation, acting Attor-
ney General Rod Rosenstein said: ‘‘A
special counsel is necessary in order for
the American people to have full con-
fidence in the outcome. Our Nation is
grounded on the rule of law, and the
public must be assured that govern-
ment officials administer the law fair-
ly.’’
This investigation has been about
following the facts wherever they may
lead, getting to the truth of Russia’s
involvement in the 2016 election, and
ensuring government is transparent
and accountable to the American pub-
lic.
This does not predetermine the out-
come of that investigation. It simply
expresses that the report of the special
counsel should be made available to
Congress and to the American people.
The public, including my constitu-
ents in California—our constituents in
California, Mr. Speaker—want to know
what happened. Nearly 9 in 10 Ameri-
cans in both parties say the investiga-
tion should produce a full public report
on their findings. Not only do the
American people want to know, but
they deserve to know. Congress needs
to preserve their ability to know.
Our election system is an integral
part of what makes us the beacon of
Western democracy. Any and all at-
tempts to undermine this system is an
attack on our country’s values and
cannot be taken lightly.
This is a serious investigation with
consequences for our elections, democ-
racy, government, and the future of
this country and democracy itself.
There is no one with more intimate
knowledge of Russia’s involvement in
our election than the special counsel.
To date, this investigation has re-
sulted in 34 people and three companies
being criminally charged; nearly 200
charges filed; seven guilty pleas; one
conviction following a jury trial; and
the investigation, while costing $25
million, has recovered approximately
$48 million in assets from tax evasion.
Mr. Speaker, eight Federal and con-
gressional intelligence and national se-
curity groups believe Russia interfered

March 13, 2019
in our election, with the Central Intel-
ligence Agency, the National Security
Agency, the FBI, and the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence con-
cluding that Vladimir Putin personally
‘‘ordered an influence campaign in 2016
aimed at the U.S. Presidential elec-
tion’’ to ‘‘undermine public faith in the
democratic process.’’
The last time our country had a spe-
cial counsel operating under the same
rules as this probe was in 1993 to inves-
tigate the Waco siege and allegations
of government wrongdoing. Prosecu-
tors posted their final report directly
on the internet with hundreds of pages
of exhibits and timelines. The Amer-
ican people must receive the same
transparency when this report is re-
leased.
I encourage my friends across the
aisle to support the release of this re-
port. We have commitments to support
it from three House Republican lead-
ers, including the minority leader, the
minority whip, and the Republican
Conference chair. I hope all my col-
leagues across the aisle will join us in
this vote to ensure that we are on the
record that we will share one of the
most important investigations of our
time within these halls and with all of
America.
This is happening on our watch, and
it is our job to be faithful to our oath
to defend and uphold democracy. As
Justice Brandeis famously said, ‘‘Sun-
light is said to be the best of disinfect-
ants.’’
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume,
and I thank my friend from California
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes.
Mr. Speaker, when I see someone of
your stature come to the chair, I
think: We must be down here to debate
some serious American public policy.
We must be down here to change the
law in ways that can only happen once
in a generation when people come to-
gether to make things happen.
I don’t know what they told you
when you came to the chair this morn-
ing, but let me be the first to tell you
that is not at all why we are here
today. What we are here to say today is
important, that the American people
have a vested interest in confidence in
our democracy. That is a value shared
from the furthest side of the left to the
furthest side of the right. But the reso-
lution we have here before us today is
just a restatement of current law.
Sometimes I think, Mr. Speaker,
that we undermine faith in the democ-
racy when we try to pretend that divi-
sion exists where division does not,
where we try to pretend that we are
doing great things when, in fact, we are
not.
This is an opportunity today to speak
with a voice in Congress that says the
special counsel should release the re-
port. But let me be clear, because we
sometimes do more harm than good,
that is going to be the headline:
‘‘House Votes for Special Counsel to
Release Report.’’ That is not actually
what the resolution says, and I want to
guide you.
If you have a copy, Mr. Speaker, you
can go back through it. It is not going
to be on page 1. It is not going to be on
pages 2, 3, 4, or 5. The real substance of
the resolution is back on the bottom of
page 5, early on page 6. It says, ‘‘to the
extent permitted by law.’’
As you know from your legal back-
ground, Mr. Speaker, the law does not
allow the special counsel to release so
many things. Grand jury testimony,
for example, nowhere in the country is
grand jury testimony disclosed. Those
facts are gathered, but that is never
disclosed. Intelligence sources and
methods, that is never disclosed, nor
would anybody on the other side of the
aisle suggest that it should be.
That is why, in the resolution drafted
by the Democratic chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee, it says specifically
that these things need not be released
because it is prohibited by law. I only
make that point, Mr. Speaker, because
sometimes the headlines are all we
read when they come through on our
Twitter feed. Sometimes we believe the
headline tells the whole story.
I want to make it clear that there is
unanimity in this Chamber that trans-
parency is valuable in our Republic.
But it is also true that this is a nation
of laws. The reason the special counsel
exists is because we are a nation of
laws, and the substance of the special
counsel’s report is going to be governed
by those laws. To the extent allowable
by law, our Attorney General has al-
ready said he wants to make the entire
thing available.
I don’t know how you want to char-
acterize the resolution today, Mr.
Speaker, whether you want to charac-
terize it as an insistence of the House
on how the administration should be-
have or just a big attaboy to our new
Attorney General to say: You are doing
a great job, and we are behind you 100
percent in what you have already
promised the American people you
were going to do.
However you characterize that reso-
lution—we heard it in the Rules Com-
mittee, as my friend from California
suggested—it is coming to the floor
today under a closed rule. So if any-
body has any additional changes they
want to make, those changes will not
be permitted. This is a take-it-or-
leave-it resolution from the Rules
Committee today.
But as a restatement of current law,
it is quite clear. Again, you have to go
all the way to the back of the resolu-
tion to find those 10 lines of substance.
But when you get there, you will find
these are already things the Attorney
General has agreed to, and all Ameri-
cans should be pleased about that out-
come.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, let me join with my
friend from Georgia in noting how im-
portant it is that you are presiding, my
good friend, with lots of history be-
tween the two of us in our political life
in California and our education, I
might add to the Jesuits.
I want to say to my good friend, I
look at this as one of those opportuni-
ties where we may not get a headline.
Unfortunately, too many of the head-
lines talk about how divisive it is here.
Certainly, there is a lot of that.
But when I go home and do town-
halls—and I do a lot of them in north-
ern California—when this question
comes up about polarization, I talk
about all the times we do work to-
gether that don’t get out, certainly, in
the headlines, because that is not what
sells advertising, apparently. I think
this is one of those moments that we
aspire to that, that we actually aspire
that somebody picks up on this; that
all of us, in these extraordinary cir-
cumstances, are being faithful to our
oath; that we make sure that the
things that may have happened, that
apparently did happen, that the public
needs confidence in us.
When we look every day, including
today, at the affronts and the attacks
on so many institutions in America,
and this institution having had chal-
lenges, this might be one of those op-
portunities, at least for us, to say: We
agree. We may have differences of opin-
ion about who did what, but we have
faith.
For me, I think history will say that
this special counsel is one of those
providential Americans. With his back-
ground, with his determination to be-
lieve in fidelity and truth, we were
lucky to have this person at this point
in time.
I put my faith in this institution. I
put faith in the special counsel. In this
instance, I hear from you, my friend
from Georgia, that we are going to put
our faith in this institution and one
another, that we can show the Amer-
ican people that this is, indeed, more
important than party, and it is more
important than any of our individual
political careers.
I did want to mention, Mr. Speaker,
that this is a sense of Congress and
that this is not the first time we have
brought a resolution like this to the
floor. In fact, just last week, we
brought a resolution to the floor to
send a message to the American people
that Congress is united in condemning
anti-Semitism and bigotry in all its
forms. There are people who criticized
us for bringing that and thought that
it was unnecessary, but we brought
that to the floor.
A majority of Republicans joined
Democrats, an overwhelming majority,
in voting for it. Leader MCCARTHY
called it a resolution to make a state-
ment. Whip SCALISE said, regarding the
resolution, ‘‘We must all take a strong

stand against hatred and bigotry wher-
ever we see it, and I am glad this reso-
lution makes’’ sense.
We agree with our colleagues on the
other side of the aisle that passing
these types of resolutions can make a
strong statement. Although they may
seem to some as unnecessary, these
statements on these kinds of important
issues, I believe, are very necessary for
this institution to make, particularly
when they are bipartisan.
Today, we are letting Attorney Gen-
eral Barr and everyone else know that
we are all united behind one common
principle, which I believe he agreed to
in his confirmation hearings, which the
Member from Georgia alluded to. That
complete transparency, consistent with
law, is vital to the success of our de-
mocracy. The American people deserve
to have access to this report.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
7 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. BURGESS), a senior member on the
Rules Committee and a subcommittee
ranking member on the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in opposi-
tion to the rule providing for consider-
ation of H. Con. Res. 24 to release the
special counsel’s investigation report,
a report that, I may note, has not yet
been issued.
The resolution we are considering
here today will not change the law; it
will not increase transparency; and it
will provide no new benefit to the
American people. Quite simply, this
resolution merely states current law.
This resolution simply restates current
Department of Justice protocol.
We had a Member here in this House
who was also a physician and who was
a member of the other party, former
Congressman McDermott of Wash-
ington State. I remember one time Re-
publicans offered a sense of Congress
resolution that had something to do
with taxes. The gentleman took to the
floor of the House and said, if you want
to do something about taxes, do some-
thing about taxes, but a sense of Con-
gress resolution, why you might as
well be sending a get-well card to the
IRS.
That is the force with which we are
exercising our congressional time
today. Speaker PELOSI and the Demo-
cratic leadership have decided to use
valuable legislative time to consider a
resolution that changes nothing and
does not serve the American people.
In the time that we have spent debat-
ing this resolution, we could have been
discussing more serious matters before
this body. Let’s just run through a few
of them.
The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors
Protection Act has been brought to the
floor 17 times, yet the current Demo-
cratic leadership refuses to bring up
this legislation for a vote. I might re-
mind the body that this bill is not
about abortion but saving the lives of
children who are, in fact, born alive.
b 1230
You know, I don’t make it a habit of
watching ‘‘60 Minutes’’ on television,
but last Sunday night, ‘‘60 Minutes’’
had a news story on the dramatic ad-
vances in the treatment and perhaps—
perhaps—inching towards a cure for
sickle cell disease.
Sickle cell disease is a painful condi-
tion I witnessed many times as a resi-
dent at Parkland Hospital back in the
1970s.
For years, sickle cell received very
little attention. Now, I am happy to
say in the last Congress, under the
leadership of DANNY DAVIS of Illinois,
our subcommittee worked on and
passed his bill dealing with sickle cell.
It finally was passed by the Senate in
October of last year, and it was signed
into law by the President last Decem-
ber.
As a consequence, the push for sickle
cell research has continued. The 21st
Century Cures Act, which this Con-
gress worked on at the end of the pre-
vious administration, certainly can be
given some credit for that. But, I have
to tell you, it was dramatic to have the
Director of the NIH interviewed on ‘‘60
Minutes’’ talking about a cure for sick-
le cell.
So our work that we do here is im-
portant. It does impact the lives of real
people, and I think that is just one dra-
matic example.
Well, another example was the first
tax reform, 31 years, that was signed
into law last year, and here we are a
month out from tax day. We could use
this time to strengthen the progress we
made on the tax reform that was
passed last year.
In the last Congress, we helped Amer-
ican people keep more of their hard-
earned money. We should be working
to continue that momentum, perhaps
make those tax cuts permanent for the
middle class.
We could be discussing the Demo-
crats’ government-run, bureaucratic,
top-down healthcare plan that would
strip hardworking Americans of their
private health insurance and offer less
coverage at more expense to American
taxpayers, but we are not.
Today, we could be talking about
patent abuse entities, so-called patent
trolls, particularly troublesome in the
eastern district of Texas, where most
of those cases are litigated.
The House could be considering the
Troll Act, legislation that I have intro-
duced for three terms of Congress to
limit patent assertion entities and pro-
tect Americans’ intellectual property.
We could be using this time to dis-
cuss our Nation’s critical need for bor-
der security to protect the American
people and defend our borders.
In February of 2019, the shortest
month of the year, only 28 days, more
than 75,000 people that we know of
crossed the border without legal sta-
tus, in excess of a 100 percent increase
from the same period last year. People
argue whether that is an emergency. I
believe that it is, but we could be talk-
ing about that.
In a week in which more than 150 lost
their lives, we could be using this time
to discuss aviation safety and does
Congress need to do anything further
to ensure the continued safety of the
American traveling public.
So time and again, we found that
Members on the other side of the dais
are far more interested in discrediting
the President than working on policy
that will help the American people,
this President who, in the first 2 years
and 2 months of this administration,
has probably been more productive
than any Presidency in the last 50
years.
And, finally, Mr. Speaker, we could
be using this time to address the false
and misleading comments that a mem-
ber of the Judiciary Committee made
about the Department of Health and
Human Services.
Last month, a Member of this House
grossly mischaracterized the work
being done by the Department of
Health and Human Services to care for
unaccompanied alien children by stat-
ing that the Office of Refugee Resettle-
ment created ‘‘an environment of sys-
temic sexual assaults by Health and
Human Services staff on unaccom-
panied alien children.’’
Mr. Speaker, that accusation is false,
and it was made without that Member
ever having visited an ORR facility.
Those comments are a discredit to the
effort by dedicated personnel of the Of-
fice of Refugee Resettlement, those
employees who deal with a problem
that dates back to the Obama adminis-
tration when the Office of Refugee Re-
settlement was unprepared for the
task.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
BEYER). The time of the gentleman has
expired.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas.
Mr. BURGESS. If Democrats don’t
like the work that the Office of Ref-
ugee Settlement is doing, you are in
the majority. You have the ability to
introduce legislation and pass legisla-
tion to do something different.
Instead of standing here today dis-
cussing this superfluous resolution, the
Democrats could be using this time to
change a law that they clearly don’t
like.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
a letter from the agency’s Administra-
tion for Children and Families regard-
ing this issue.
ADMINISTRATION FOR
CHILDREN & FAMILIES,
Washington, DC, February 28, 2019.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE DEUTCH: At the Feb-

HHS staff, then by staff HHS oversees.’’ (em-
phasis added). However, this is unsupported
by the data you provided and none of the al-
legations involve HHS employees. By
mischaracterizing the data during a tele-
vised hearing, you impugned the integrity of
hundreds of federal civil servants who, like
Commander White, work tirelessly to ensure
the well-being of the nearly 50,000 unaccom-
panied alien children who they have been
charged by federal law to protect annually.
On behalf of these dedicated employees of
HHS assigned to the UAC program, we re-
quest that you apologize to these career civil
servants for your untoward and unfounded
comments. Acknowledging that you were
wrong is the moral, decent and right thing to
do.
Child safety is our top priority in man-
aging the UAC program. All but one of our
care facilities are licensed by the author-
izing state residential child care agency, and
operate under intense state and federal over-
sight. Because ORR care facilities diligently
track all allegations of a wide range of sexu-
ally inappropriate conduct, ranging from
name calling or use of vulgar language to
more serious claims, the data given to Con-
gress by our agency reflects allegations
much broader than just ‘sexual abuse’ (as de-
fined in 34 U.S.C. § 20341 and in ORR regula-
tions at 45 C.F.R. § 411.6), to also include ‘sex-
ual harassment’ (as defined in ORR regula-
tions at 45 C.F.R. § 411.6) and ‘inappropriate
sexual behavior’ (a catch-all category for
sexual behaviors that do not rise to the level
of sexual abuse or sexual harassment).
The total number of sexual conduct allega-
tions reported to ORR decreased in FY2017
(1,069 total) but otherwise has generally re-
mained relatively stable each year (FY2015:
1,000 total, FY2016: 1,226 total, FY2018
(through July): 1,261 total). The vast major-
ity of the allegations reported to ORR are
‘inappropriate sexual behaviors’ involving
solely UAC, and not staff or any other
adults. Facilities can often resolve these al-
legations by, for example, counseling the mi-
nors about more appropriate behaviors.
More serious allegations rising to the level
of ‘sexual abuse’ are reported to both ORR
and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Of
these, the vast majority involve ‘UAC-on-
UAC’ allegations; the distinct minority in-
volve adults. In FY2015, 279 allegations of
sexual abuse were reported. Of these, 8.6% (24
instances) involved allegations of facility-
staff-on-minor sexual abuse. These metrics
fluctuated in subsequent years but remained
relatively consistent. In FY2016, ORR and
DOJ received 348 allegations of sexual abuse,
and 16.1% (56 instances) involved facility-
staff-on-minor allegations; in FY2017, ORR
and DOJ received 264 allegations of sexual
abuse, and 18.6% involved facility-staff-on-
minor allegations (49 instances); in FY2018
(through July), ORR and DOJ received 412 al-
legations of sexual abuse, and 11.9% involved
facility-staff-on-minor allegations (49 in-
stances). Thus, the total number of incidents
of alleged ‘sexual abuse’ involving facility-
staff-on-minor misconduct across a four-year
period spanning the previous administration
and this administration was 178 out of ap-
proximately 182,806 children under UAC care
or about 0.10% of all children placed in ORR
custody during that period. None of the alle-
gations involved ORR or other HHS federal
staff. These allegations were all fully inves-
tigated and remedial action was taken where
appropriate.
Your office staff requests an additional
briefing from ORR program officials on these
allegations. ORR will be happy to meet with
you once you correct the hearing record and
provide an apology to the dedicated men and
women working tirelessly to protect and im-
prove the lives of unaccompanied alien chil-
dren in our care.
Sincerely,
JONATHAN H. HAYES,
Acting Director,
Office of Refugee Resettlement.
Mr. BURGESS. So here is the bottom
line: House Democrats do not like the
President of the United States, and we
know that.
Less than 3 months into the 116th
Congress, the Democrats have shown
that they will work against President
Trump to the detriment of the Amer-
ican people.
We are here in the United States
House of Representatives to serve the
American people, and the legislation
we are considering here today will not
do that.
President Trump has urged us at the
State of the Union, asked all the Mem-
bers present, to reject the politics of
revenge, resistance, and retribution
and embrace the boundless potential of
cooperation, compromise, and the com-
mon good. I also believe this is pos-
sible, and I recommend we get on with
the task.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LOFGREN), the dis-
tinguished chair of the Committee on
House Administration.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of this resolution today.
We have a responsibility to the
American people to uphold the Con-
stitution and rule of law, and we also
have an obligation, as a separate and
equal branch of government, to act as
a check on the executive branch.
Without access to necessary informa-
tion, we can’t fulfill our constitu-
tionally prescribed duties. We must
have not only this report, but the evi-
dence collected to support the report.
If the President has nothing to hide,
then he would also support this resolu-
tion by tweet or verbal approval.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a co-
sponsor of this legislation. It is very
important for our country.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Committee
on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on
Antitrust, Commercial and Adminis-
trative Law.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
in strong support of this resolution.
Special Counsel Mueller’s investiga-
tion has resulted in 199 criminal
charges against 39 people and entities.
Seven people have pleaded guilty, and
five people have been sentenced to pris-
on.
This investigation has been con-
ducted on behalf of the American peo-
ple, and they are entitled to know the
results of this investigation.
This investigation was begun to safe-
guard our democracy, and the Amer-
ican people deserve to know the results
of this investigation; and yet President
Trump has repeatedly sought to attack
and discredit the investigation, label-
ing it a witch hunt and even contem-
plating firing the special counsel.
The President’s pick for Attorney
General, Bill Barr, has also made it
clear during his confirmation hearing
that he will only follow DOJ’s policies
that are convenient for the President.
Therefore, it is up to Congress to make
sure that documents related to the spe-
cial counsel’s investigation are pre-
served and published.
That is why I introduced the Special
Counsel Transparency Act, with Con-
gressman DOGGETT, to require the pub-
lication of the special counsel’s report.
No one person should decide what the
public gets to see. The American people
have a right to come to their own con-
clusions and to know that justice was
served.
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor
of the American people. Allow them to
see the results of the investigation con-
ducted on their behalf. Bring trans-
parency to this process. Support this
resolution and signal a willingness to
respect the right of the American peo-
ple to see the consequences and the re-
sults of this important investigation
which, again, was begun to safeguard
our democracy.
This shouldn’t be a Republican or
Democratic issue. Mr. Speaker, I hope
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle will join us in our effort to pre-
serve our democracy.
I thank, again, the gentleman for
yielding.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my friend
from Rhode Island before he leaves the
floor: The bill that he introduced, was
that also a House resolution or was
that an H.R. to insist on the revealing?
Mr. CICILLINE. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this
legislation that I introduced is an H.R.
But if the point of the gentleman’s
question is is that a more effective way
to do it, I would welcome support on
my resolution. I haven’t been as suc-
cessful getting my Republican col-
leagues to join us.
We are hoping that this resolution is
a way for him to find his way toward
transparency, democracy, and spirit of
bipartisanship and letting the Amer-
ican people know the results of the in-
vestigation.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman from Rhode Island
introducing the bill.
And I think that is an important dis-
tinction, Mr. Speaker, and that is what
you have heard, largely. You heard it
in the Rules Committee; you have
heard it down here on the floor, that:
Listen, there are lots of things that we
could be doing here, and if we wanted
to pass a law that insisted that the en-
tire report was released—those parts
that are prohibited from being released
under current law and those parts that
are intended to be released under cur-
rent law—we could do that. That is just
not what we are doing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2694 March 13, 2019
What we are doing is saying: Hey, do
you know what current law is? Follow
current law. Follow current law. We,
the House of Representatives, have
thought about it, and in our delibera-
tive wisdom, we are prepared to an-
nounce that we believe current law
should be followed—Signed, U.S. House
of Representatives.
There are those who would have you
believe this is something more than
that. It is not. There is nothing wrong
with what we are doing today except
that it is not a particularly valuable
use of time.
When I opened, Mr. Speaker, you
were not in the chair, but I mentioned
that I think we do great damage to
trust in our Republic when we seek di-
vision instead of highlighting our
unity. To suggest that we are down
here doing something to protect our
Republic from its inevitable demise is
just ridiculous. No such thing is hap-
pening here on the floor today. All that
is happening on the floor today is say-
ing that we, the duly-elected Members
of the U.S. House of Representatives,
believe U.S. law should be followed.
Mr. Speaker, I agree, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, in
response to my friend from Georgia, I
want to agree—and maybe we disagree
a little bit.
I do think this is important. I think
it is the unusual circumstance, and a
lot of things that we have no direct
control over have brought us to this
circumstance.
Social media and the use of social
media in our elections is relatively
new, coming from the Bay area where
so much of the genesis happened.
So I think it is important, and I do
think there is lacking—and hyperbole
is something that sometimes doesn’t
happen in this Chamber, but I think it
is not a hyperbole to say that the U.S.
House of Representatives, hopefully,
unanimously says that the law should
be followed to its letter.
So I think we agree, and I don’t want
to look for a way to disagree.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH).
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what is in
the Mueller report and neither do you.
The American people don’t know what
is in the Mueller report, but they want
to know. And I want to know, as you
do, and why not?
Mr. Speaker, 81 percent of the Amer-
ican people polled say they want to
know, and that includes 79 percent of
the Republicans. That is good news.
Because what we do know, without
knowing the details of the Mueller re-
port, is that really bad stuff happened
in the last election. Some of it was in
a campaign, and some of it was in a
foreign country that is our severe ad-
versary; and I speak, of course, of
Vladimir Putin’s Russia.
But the bad stuff: a former campaign
foreign policy adviser indicted and con-
victed, Mr. Papadopoulos; a former
campaign manager on his way to jail,
Mr. Manafort; a former campaign aide
and Manafort’s long-time junior busi-
ness partner indicted; a former foreign
policy national security adviser plead-
ed guilty, Mr. Flynn.
This is the high level of a campaign
where crimes are not just being dis-
cussed; there have been convictions
and guilty pleas. What is behind all of
that? We need to know.
And, incidentally, Mr. Speaker, the
American people are footing the bill
for this—about $25 million, as far as we
can tell. They have got a right to
know.
But, in addition to whatever hap-
pened in the campaign, really bad stuff
happened in Russia. We know from our
own intelligence agencies that Russia
made a concerted effort and a deter-
mined effort and a well-financed effort
to interfere in our election.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentleman from Vermont.
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, outside in-
terference goes to the heart of our de-
mocracy. The most important chal-
lenge for our country is that we, the
citizens of this country, make the deci-
sion on who is our President, who are
our Senators, and who are our Rep-
resentatives.
We have to get to the bottom of what
Russia did and how they did it so that
we can take steps to make certain that
that does not happen in the future. It is
the American people who decide who is
their leader.
Release the Mueller report.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I am looking for some-
thing to disagree with my friend from
Vermont about. I don’t disagree with
him about anything at all. I thought
that was a very thoughtful presen-
tation.
The only thing I would point out is
the reason that he doesn’t know what
is in the Mueller report and the Amer-
ican people don’t know what is in the
Mueller report, is because as of today,
there is no Mueller report. That is the
only reason we don’t know what is in
it. It hasn’t been released yet.
I don’t mean released to the public. I
mean, Mueller hasn’t written it and
handed it to the Attorney General yet,
and so we don’t know. When that hap-
pens, let me tell you what the Attor-
ney General has said, Mr. Speaker. The
Attorney General has committed to
being transparent with Congress and
the public consistent with the rules
and the law. I don’t think we would ask
anything different of him.
The Attorney General has committed
to providing as much information as he
can consistent with current regula-
tions. I don’t think we would ask any-
thing different of him than that, and,
certainly, this resolution does not ask
anything different of him other than
that.
He says that his objective and goal is
to get as much information as he can
to the public. That is exactly what this
resolution asks for; exactly what he
has already committed to. And he says,
‘‘I feel like I’m in a position in life
where I can do the right thing and not
really care about the consequences. I
can be truly independent.’’
Well, that doesn’t just mean truly
independent from pressure put on him
from the White House. It also means
truly independent from statements of
opinion sent to him by the U.S. House.
He is going to do the right thing, as al-
lowed by the law and resolutions. If he
doesn’t, this House can act and try to
push a different outcome.
Just understand that that is not
what this resolution does today. It is
simply a statement of fact. To my
friend from California, there are those
Members of Congress that sometimes
they speak and you just want to get
out your sharp stick, Mr. Speaker, and
poke them a little bit harder. They
don’t calm you down. They rile you up.
My friend from California is one of
those folks whose thoughtful words al-
ways recenter me and remind me what
we have together.
He is right about the hyperbole, and
I don’t want to mischaracterize this
resolution. It does do one thing that is
not available in current law today, and
that is, that it makes the official posi-
tion of the United States House known.
I have always presumed that the Attor-
ney General would follow the law. This
resolution says we expect the Attorney
General to follow the law.
It is not that it does nothing. It is
just that it does something so very lit-
tle, perhaps our time would be better
spent elsewhere, but I support the un-
derlying premise.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
want to thank my friend for pointing
out that I am not a poker, that I might
actually be trying to be thoughtful.
Maybe it is because I was once reg-
istered as a Republican. I don’t regu-
larly admit that sometimes, at least
not in my district.
But I do think this conversation is
important on multiple levels, and I ap-
preciate the fact that the gentleman is
here to present his side of the aisle’s
position.
I think there is a danger here for us
to resume to our corners, and this is an
instance where I really think it is im-
portant—and, hopefully, it is news-
worthy—to the media and to the gen-
eral public that we are coming to this
moment. Although it is a resolution, I
still think it is significant without in-
dulging in hyperbole.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERL-
MUTTER), my friend and a distinguished
member of the Rules Committee.

and I thank the gentleman from Geor-
gia. I have not heard you two be so
agreeable. Disagreeable is what usually
you are, but so agreeable, and the rea-
son there is agreement here is, we all
want to see what is in this report.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of the rule and the underlying resolu-
tion, and I would like to remind every-
body about what the Mueller investiga-
tion is about. Russia interfered in the
2016 U.S. Presidential election with, in
my opinion, the goal of helping Donald
Trump be elected.
This is a fact confirmed by the U.S.
intelligence community, as well as by
the House and Senate Intelligence
Committees. This should concern every
American, Republican, Democrat, or
Independent.
In response to this unprecedented at-
tack on our elections, Robert Mueller
was appointed to serve as special coun-
sel for the Justice Department to fol-
low the facts wherever they may lead,
whether they implicate people or exon-
erate people. We need to know pre-
cisely what happened, understand who
was involved, how it was accomplished,
and, ultimately, hold those responsible
for this attack on our election account-
able under our laws. This investigation
will also ensure we better protect our
elections in the future.
Now, we have had 2 convictions of
Mr. Manafort, 7 guilty pleas, 34 people
and 3 companies indicted as part of the
Mueller investigation. Six of the people
indicted were part of President
Trump’s inner circle with the cam-
paign and business. So it is important
for us to understand precisely what is
in the report.
I appreciate the fact that the Rules
Committee unanimously supported this
particular rule and the underlying res-
olution, and I say to my friend from
Georgia, you are right. The law is what
it is and that it says the report should
be withheld until fully written and pre-
pared. And then if Mr. BARR does what
he says he was going to do, it will be
made available to all of us.
We are emphasizing that point be-
cause Americans should know precisely
what happened and where this inves-
tigation has led. I thank my friend
from California for bringing this rule.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I tell
my friend, I do not have any speakers
remaining at this point, so I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Let me thank the gentleman from
California and congratulate him on his
new distinguished post on the Rules
Committee. My good friend who I have
seen quite frequently over the years at
the Rules Committee and I have known
of his consistent concern with the rule
of law and truly appreciate his com-
ments today as it relates to the rule of
law.
I would like my comments to be
strictly on that question and really the
American people of whom each and
every one of us come here to represent.
I don’t want to recount in detail, but
I do want to make mention that we
know that the Intelligence Committee
in January 2017 concluded—and that is
the intelligence community con-
cluded—in a report that Russian Presi-
dent Putin ordered and influenced the
campaign of 2016 on the Presidential
election. We all know recently there
were attempts to influence the 2018
election.
We won’t dwell on that. We won’t
dwell on the fact that there are discus-
sions and review in the special coun-
sel’s work dealing with collusion or the
questions dealing with the campaign of
the present President and Russia.
I believe that the real point of this is
to answer the questions of the Amer-
ican people. If we say that the purpose
of appointing the special counsel to
oversee the investigation is to ensure
that the American public would have
full confidence in the integrity of the
investigation, regardless of what it
says, I am here to say, regardless of
what the Mueller report will say—and
we know that there will be comments
made by the general public, leaders of
Congress, and that is their right as
Americans—we want to reinforce the
fact that the DOJ regulations them-
selves say that investigation results
should be made fully extended to the
American public in the public interest,
and that the results of that report
should be made available to the Amer-
ican people.
Obviously, being concerned about
persons that are mentioned with no
relevance whatsoever, as a lawyer, I
would want to make sure such protec-
tions occur. But it is true that Special
Counsel Mueller previously served in
the Department of Justice as a pros-
ecutor, and director of the FBI in the
Republican and Democrat administra-
tions where he built a reputation of
competence, fairness, and nonpartisan-
ship.
With that in mind, we thank him for
the work he has done that has shown a
number of guilty pleas and other re-
sponses.
But the main point is the American
people need to know that their govern-
ment adheres to the rule of law, and
the integrity of the Constitution. All
we are asking today is to reflect in a
sense of Congress that you, the Amer-
ican people, that my colleagues in this
House and the Senate should have the
right to see the full report.
I ask for support of the underlying
bill, and I ask us to do it in a bipar-
tisan way.
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the
Committee on Judiciary, which has oversight
of the Department of Justice, and as a senior
member of the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity, which has oversight over our election se-
curity infrastructure, I rise in strong support of
H. Con. Res. 24.
Mr. Speaker, I take no glee in standing
here.
In fact, there are many parts of the last 22
months, since the day that Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI
Director Robert Mueller to be Special Counsel,
where I have been concerned for the state of
our democracy.
And I know, from my travels back to the
18th Congressional District of Texas, around
our Nation, and to nations involved, that many
Americans are concerned about our democ-
racy.
Since well before the 2016 election, Ameri-
cans have been concerned about how Russia
was manipulating our election and the extent
to which that crime was aided and abetted by
associates of the Trump Campaign.
American intelligence officials have been
keenly aware of this threat to the democracy
posed by Russia’s active measures campaign
to sabotage the election and secure the Amer-
ican presidency for its preferred candidate, the
current occupant of the Oval Office.
Shortly after the President took office,
James Comey, the former director of the FBI
testified to the House Intelligence Committee
in a public congressional hearing that there
was an active FBI investigation into Russia’s
interference and the extent to which Russia
and was aided and abetted by agents of the
Trump Campaign.
Shortly after the hearing, the President fired
James Comey as FBI Director and went on
broadcast television and cited the looming
Russia investigation as his reason for doing
so.
The next day in the Oval Office, the Presi-
dent of the United States met with the Russian
Ambassador and other officials from the Krem-
lin and told them that he had gotten rid of ‘‘nut
job’’ Comey and had gotten the Russian in-
vestigation off his back.
Mere days later, the Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral, Rod Rosenstein appointed legendary FBI
Director and Department of Justice prosecutor
Robert Mueller as Special Counsel to inves-
tigate whether Russia interfered in our election
and whether that effort was aided and abetted
by members of the Trump Campaign.
Since that time, the investigation has se-
cured numerous indictments, convictions or
guilty pleas from the: President’s campaign
manager, his deputy campaign manager, his
campaign’s foreign policy advisor, his former
personal attorney, his longtime confidante, and
many others, including Russian agents.
The president has attempted to dismiss
these crimes and other charges brought—like
obstruction of justice, perjury, making false
statements, etc.—as ‘‘process crimes,’’ when
in actuality they are crimes designed to safe-
guard the integrity of the criminal justice sys-
tem and the rule of law.
But these are merely the headlines, when
we look closer at just what we have learned
from the Russia investigation, we have a road-
map on how to manipulate the electoral proc-
ess in the world’s oldest democracy.
We know that the Russians manipulated our
social media systems.
They did this by turning our social media
platforms like Twitter and Facebook, into
rowdy and unwieldy debates that turned Amer-
icans against one another.
They did this by creating fake online social
media accounts and populated them on social
media platforms.
After infiltrating the social media accounts of
real Americans, these fake accounts sought to
sow discord in these online communities by
purposely exacerbating divisions within our

Nation and creating new ones—all with the in-
tent of pitting Americans against one another.
While they were distorting the social media
landscape, they were also selectively dissemi-
nating emails stolen from the Democratic Na-
tional Committee and the campaign of Hillary
Clinton with the purpose of timing the dissemi-
nation to maximize political damage on Sec-
retary Clinton’s campaign.
Based on the statements from the Trump
Campaign, we also know that it was actively
trying to suppress the votes of groups tradi-
tionally aligned with the Democratic party, in-
cluding women, African Americans and young
voters.
We now know, due to information uncov-
ered during the pendency of the Special
Counsel’s investigation, Russians affiliated
with the highest ranks of the Kremlin were at
Trump Tower during the middle of the 2016
election.
We know that then-candidate Trump asked
Russia, ‘‘Russia, if you’re releasing, I hope
you will find Hillary’s stolen emails.’’
In May 2017, Special Counsel Mueller was
appointed with the task of getting to the bot-
tom of this.
The American people deserve answers to
know how their last presidential election was a
crime scene so that we may learn to ensure
that the next one is also not a crime scene.
And, the American people have every rea-
son to have confidence in the report produced
by the Special Counsel.
The Special Counsel is a decorated Amer-
ican hero and public servant. He has served
as the FBI director for presidents of both par-
ties.
He has served as a line prosecutor, a
United States Attorney and a leader within the
Justice Department.
Despite protestations by the President, this
is not a witch hunt—it has yielded the public
indictments of 34 individuals and 3 companies,
7 guilty pleas, and 1 conviction.
The American people are watching.
The most recent public opinion poll shows
that a super majority of Americans—a full 68
percent—wants the Mueller Report made pub-
lic.
The Mueller Report is one unparalleled way
in which Americans can learn this information
with confidence.
And, finally, we must tackle a serious issue
that is being discussed among elected officials
and the Justice Department.
Over the past two years, we have been told
that it is Justice Department regulations that a
sitting President cannot be indicted. I will note
that this principle has not been tested in court.
That regulation was implemented during the
Watergate investigation, under the theory that
the President cannot be subjected to criminal
process.
But, assuming arguendo that this regulation
is correct, and the President cannot be sub-
jected to criminal process and therefore can-
not and should not be indicted, it is a logical
fallacy to say that because he cannot be in-
dicted by virtue of his office, and because it is
Justice Department regulation not to reveal in-
formation about unindicted parties and individ-
uals, the Justice Department cannot reveal
any information of potential wrongdoing by the
President and not reveal any information to
the body that possesses the constitutional re-
sponsibility for holding this president account-
able.
For these reasons, I rise in strong support
of H. Con. Res. 24, and urge my colleagues
to support it and urge passage so the Amer-
ican people can learn how the 2016 election
became a crime scene.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I hope folks pay atten-
tion to some of those things that have
brought folks together today, and I
hope folks pay attention to some of
those things that haven’t brought us
together today.
We have talked about whether there
has been overstatement and hyperbole,
whether it comes from that end of
Pennsylvania Avenue or this end of
Pennsylvania Avenue. None of us are
advantaged by that. It breeds more dis-
trust in the American public, and
breeds more distrust in this institu-
tion.
We have talked about who is to
blame within the administration. Of
course, there is news today of Paul
Manafort’s sentence, not for anything
related to the election, but for things
related to his private business prac-
tices. There will be efforts to conflate
those two investigations. Those are
two different investigations, and I
think the American people are dis-
advantaged if they are led to believe
that those sentences are related to the
election of the President of the United
States.
But what you have heard is a lot of
unanimity, as you would expect, that
we are a Nation of laws and the rule of
law should be followed, and trans-
parency should be our touchstone, and
the American People, the boss of each
and every one of us, whether we work
on that end of Pennsylvania Avenue or
this end of Pennsylvania Avenue, have
a right to know what their tax dollars
have paid for and what their govern-
ment is up to.
I find that very encouraging that we
have that sense of agreement here
today, Mr. Speaker. What is noticeably
absent in this resolution is the dra-
matic overreach that I think has char-
acterized most of the work we have
done so far in 2019. Things that could
have been partnership issues have been
pushed further and further out to the
edge of the political continuum that
they became partisan issues.
This resolution does not make those
mistakes of the past, and to my friend
from California’s point, these things
are done incrementally. Trust is built
incrementally; relationships grow in-
crementally; and success happens in-
crementally.
It is my great hope, Mr. Speaker,
that those things that unite us, trans-
parency, rule of law, trust in and of the
American people will begin today to
flourish in ways, perhaps, those com-
mon themes have not thus far. And
both parties play a role in that dis-
appointing outcome. But success has to
begin on one day, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps
success begins today.
I serve on the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee. There is no
such thing as a Republican road or a
Democratic bridge. There is no such
thing as sitting in traffic on a Demo-
cratic highway or missing your child’s
soccer game because of malfunctions
on a Republican road. We are all in this
together.
b 1300
I do not plan to offer a previous ques-
tion today, Mr. Speaker, because this
isn’t one of those issues that dramati-
cally divides us. My friend suggested in
the Rules Committee we passed this
out in, I think, our first voice vote of
the year out of the Rules Committee,
and I intend to do exactly that today.
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend
from California for yielding the time
and leading the debate today, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, again, it is a pleasure to
see you up there. And to my friend
from Georgia, in his long, illustrious
public career, I want to thank him for
his comity here today.
I can’t help but think so many Amer-
icans now and people who are filled
with adrenaline and hyperbole talk
about what a difficult time this is, and
I wouldn’t underestimate the chal-
lenges ahead of us; but, arguably, a
more difficult time, I was thinking of
Mr. Lincoln’s comments about appeal-
ing to the better angels of our nature,
and perhaps this is a turning point.
Certainly we will be tested, and we
will fail on occasion, but to my friend,
for whatever time both of us have left
here, I would like to personally say to
the degree we can find things that are
of interest to your district and my dis-
trict, they are of interest to the United
States, and I would love to work with
the gentleman to find those things.
Lastly, I just can’t help but comment
on my observation about providential
Americans in history. I was reading
about Mr. Mueller and his comments
when he was FBI Director in the con-
text of his amazing life and career as a
combat veteran, a Bronze Star winner
in the Marine Corps in Vietnam. I
think of my own father who was a de-
voted Marine Corps combat veteran
who is buried in Arlington. My dad and
all marines, although I was not one,
liked to always recite ‘‘Semper
Fidelis.’’
The special counsel, in his comments
when he was FBI Director, assures me
that the work he does in ways that I
find profound, talked about fidelity as
he talked to his agents, that the fidel-
ity to this Constitution, to this coun-
try, and to the truth will find us true
to the path that we want to take and
to success as we look for the better an-
gels of our nature.
Mr. Speaker, this is a simple vote but
an important vote. We need to get to
the bottom of what happened and put
faith in the special counsel’s findings
and put faith in the American public
and the people that they can devise
their own truth when we give them this
investigation’s report.

Mr. Speaker, you either believe the
public and Congress should see the re-
port or you don’t. Fortunately, it looks
like we are agreed that they should. We
owe it to our constituents, the Amer-
ican people, and future generations to
do the right thing always, but today, I
think, in particular, to support the re-
lease of this report.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the rule and a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the pre-
vious question.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

ACKNOWLEDGING LACK OF TRANS-
PARENCY IN FINANCIAL TRANS-
ACTIONS POSES A THREAT TO
NATIONAL SECURITY
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 206) acknowledging that
the lack of sunlight and transparency
in financial transactions and corporate
formation poses a threat to our na-
tional security and our economy’s se-
curity and supporting efforts to close
related loopholes, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 206
Whereas money laundering and other fi-
nancial crimes are serious threats to our na-
tional and economic security;
Whereas the United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime has reported ‘‘The esti-
mated amount of money laundered globally
in one year is 2 - 5% of global GDP, or $800
billion - $2 trillion in current US dollars’’;
Whereas the scale, efficiency, and com-
plexity of the U.S. financial system make it
a prime target for those who seek to conceal,
launder, and move the proceeds of illicit ac-
tivity;
Whereas money launderers, terrorist fin-
anciers, corrupt individuals and organiza-
tions, and their facilitators have proven to
adapt quickly in order to avoid detection;
Whereas given the global nature of money
laundering and terrorist financing, and the
increasing interrelatedness within the finan-
cial system, a secure national and multilat-
eral framework is essential to the integrity
of the U.S. financial system;
Whereas extensive collaboration among fi-
nancial regulators, the Department of the
Treasury, law enforcement, and the private
sector is required to curtail the illicit flow of
money throughout the United States;
Whereas despite how extensive and effec-
tive these efforts are in the United States,
there is still substantial room for improve-
ment;
Whereas financial compliance, reporting,
investigation, and collaboration, as well as
courageous whistleblowers and investigative
reporting have had significant impact in
shining sunlight on the people and institu-
tions behind dark money and markets;
Whereas in 2016, the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF), the international standards
setting body, evaluated the United States’
anti-money laundering/combating the fi-
nancing of terrorism measures and deter-
mined the United States has significant gaps
in its framework;
Whereas in 2016, the FATF found that in
the United States, ‘‘Minimal measures are
imposed on designated non-financial busi-
nesses and professions (DNFBPs), other than
casinos and dealers in precious metals and
stones’’;
Whereas in 2016, the FATF recommended,
‘‘The U.S. should conduct a vulnerability
analysis of the minimally covered DNFBP
sectors to address the higher risks to which
these sectors are exposed, and consider what
measures could be introduced to address
them’’;
Whereas dealers in arts and antiquities are
not, by definition, covered ‘‘financial insti-
tutions’’ required to comply with the Bank
Secrecy Act;
Whereas Federal authorities have cau-
tioned that art collectors and dealers to be
particularly careful trading Near Eastern an-
tiquities, warning that artifacts plundered
by terrorist organizations such as the Is-
lamic State of Iraq and the Levant are enter-
ing the marketplace;
Whereas, according to the Antiquities Coa-
lition, ‘‘because the United States is the
largest destination for archaeological and
ethnological objects from around the world,
the discovery of recently looted and traf-
ficked artifacts in our country not only
makes Americans and our institutions acces-
sories to crimes, but also threatens our rela-
tions with other countries’’;
Whereas the real-estate industry, both
commercial and residential, is exempt from
having to develop and implement a four-pil-
lar anti-money laundering program pursuant
to the Bank Secrecy Act;
Whereas it was asserted in a 2018 Con-
ference Report by the Terrorism,
Transnational Crime and Corruption Center
at the Schar School of Policy and Govern-
ment of George Mason University, money
laundering in real estate (MLRE) has dam-
aging effects on local economies by nega-
tively impacting property prices and dis-
locating residents;
Whereas in 2017, in response to evidence
about significant money laundering through
real estate in the United States, the Finan-
cial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
issued Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs)
requiring limited beneficial ownership dis-
closure in certain transactions involving
high-end luxury real estate and ‘‘found that
about 30 percent of the transactions covered
by the GTOs involve a beneficial owner or
purchaser representative that is also the
subject of a previous suspicious activity re-
port’’;
Whereas the influx of illicit money, includ-
ing from Russian oligarchs, has flowed large-
ly unimpeded into the United States through
these anonymous shell companies and into
U.S. investments, including luxury high-end
real estate;
Whereas the United States has not fulfilled
the recommended steps to address the
money-laundering loopholes that the FATF
has identified with DNFBP sectors;
Whereas high-profile enforcement actions
against some of the largest and most sophis-
ticated financial institutions raise troubling
questions about the effectiveness of U.S. do-
mestic anti-money laundering and counter-
terrorism financing regulatory, compliance,
and enforcement efforts;
Whereas there are financial institutions
and individuals employed therein which con-
tinue to engage in egregious violations of the
Bank Secrecy Act and enter into deferred
prosecution agreements and non-prosecution
agreements rather than facing convictions
and sentences corresponding to the severity
of their violations;
Whereas effective anti-money laundering
programs must emphasize sound corporate
governance, including business-line account-
ability and clear lines of legal responsibility
for individuals; and
Whereas anti-money laundering examina-
tions in recent years at times failed to recog-
nize the cumulative effect of the violations
they cited, instead narrowly focusing their
attention on individual banking units, thus
permitting national banks to avoid and
delay correcting problems, which allowed
massive problems to occur before serious en-
forcement actions were taken: Now, there-
fore, be it
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives—
(1) acknowledges that the lack of sunlight
and transparency in financial transactions
poses a threat to our national security and
our economy’s security;
(2) supports efforts to close loopholes that
allow corruption, terrorism, and money
laundering to infiltrate our country’s finan-
cial system;
(3) encourages transparency to detect,
deter, and interdict individuals, entities, and
networks engaged in money laundering and
other financial crimes;
(4) urges financial institutions to comply
with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money
laundering laws and regulations; and
(5) affirms that financial institutions and
individuals should be held accountable for
money laundering and terror financing
crimes and violations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2698 March 13, 2019
money laundering loopholes and prob-
lems that continue to plague the Amer-
ican financial system.
I am pleased to bring this resolution
to the floor in recognition of Sunshine
Week. As part of Sunshine Week, the
Financial Services Committee is shin-
ing a bright light on money laundering
and discussing ways to strengthen our
country’s anti-money laundering and
counterterrorism finance efforts.
Criminals like drug traffickers,
human traffickers, fraudsters,
kleptocrats, rogue governments, and
other corrupt individuals and organiza-
tions know our financial system well
and work hard to find ways to cir-
cumvent our anti-money laundering
laws.
Congress has enacted numerous laws
to improve the transparency of finan-
cial transactions that touch institu-
tions in the United States and those on
each end of a financial transaction. We
have created reporting mechanisms,
strengthened law enforcement and in-
telligence capacities, and promoted re-
sponsible, privacy-protecting informa-
tion regimes to ensure that both the
industry and the government have the
tools needed to rid the economy of
these illicit funds. However, there are
still glaring problems and loopholes in
our system that Congress must ad-
dress.
The resolution that I have introduced
highlights two significant loopholes
that remain: the lack of transparency
in, number one, the arts and antiq-
uities industry and, number two, the
real estate industry.
First, we know that ethnic and cul-
tural artifacts are stolen and traded to
garner funds for bad actors. According
to the Antiquities Coalition: ‘‘The
United States is the largest destination
for archeological and ethnological ob-
jects from around the world.’’ We
know, too, that terror groups like ISIS
have looted and sold these treasures to
fund their operations, which the head
of UNESCO, the United Nations’ cul-
tural heritage agency, said was worth
millions of dollars and conducted on an
‘‘industrial scale.’’ However, today,
dealers in arts and antiquities are ex-
empt from the Bank Secrecy Act, cre-
ating a huge loophole for bad actors to
launder funds.
Second, the significance of the real
estate loophole in the United States
was acknowledged in 2017 by the Finan-
cial Crimes Enforcement Network,
FinCEN, when it issued Geographic
Targeting Orders, GTOs, requiring lim-
ited ownership information to be dis-
closed and reported in some high-end
real estate transactions. In fact,
FinCEN has noted that ‘‘about 30 per-
cent of the transactions covered by the
GTOs involve a beneficial owner or pur-
chaser representative that is also the
subject of a previous suspicious activ-
ity report.’’
The movement of illicit funds
throughout the global financial system
raises numerous questions regarding
the actors who are involved in these
money laundering schemes and where
the money is going. This is precisely
why the Financial Services Committee
is investigating the questionable fi-
nancing provided to President Trump
and The Trump Organization by banks
like Deutsche Bank to finance its real
estate properties. The committee is
also concerned that Trump-branded
and managed condo buildings, for ex-
ample, have taken millions from sus-
pect Russians or individuals from
former Soviet states through cash
transactions, some well above the mar-
ket value and many through shell com-
panies.
Congress must close these loopholes,
and financial institutions, including
the biggest banks, also must do their
part and fully comply with our BSA/
AML laws. Although most do, we can
continue to see not only failures in
compliance, but also egregious acts
where money laundering and terror fi-
nance are facilitated.
Further, many of our largest finan-
cial institutions have facilitated
money laundering through our U.S. fi-
nancial system from abroad. One
scheme was carried out in Deutsche
Bank’s Moscow and London branches
using mirror trading, in which corrupt
traders in Russia managed to move $10
billion in illicit funds out of Russia by
buying blue chip stocks in rubles and
selling them for U.S. dollars in London.
Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $630
million for allowing this mirror trad-
ing scheme to take place.
Another scheme involved Danske
Bank, wherein $230 billion in suspicious
funds moved from Russia and other
former Soviet states through one of
Danske Bank’s small Estonian
branches to several U.S. financial insti-
tutions.
We also know that real estate is fre-
quently used to launder dirty money.
Bad actors like Russian oligarchs and
kleptocrats often use anonymous shell
companies and all-cash schemes to buy
and sell commercial and residential
real estate to hide and clean their
money.
Today, these all-cash schemes are ex-
empt from the Bank Secrecy Act. This
must stop. In passing this resolution
today, we also remind our colleagues in
the banking industry of their respon-
sibilities.
In closing, Mr. Speaker, this resolu-
tion has benefited from the comments
of the ranking member of the Finan-
cial Services Committee, Mr.
MCHENRY, and other members of the
committee, and I thank them for their
thoughtful consideration of this resolu-
tion.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this resolution that
recognizes the need to close these loop-
holes and to urge financial institutions
to comply with the law.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman
WATERS of the House Financial Serv-
ices Committee for offering this resolu-
tion.
I rise in support of this resolution,
and I look forward to working with the
gentlewoman from California to incor-
porate its basic principles into future
legislation produced by our committee
to tackle the illicit drug trade, inter-
national financing that moves around
the globe that is illicit in nature, as
well as combating human trafficking
and using the financial system to traf-
fic in human beings, which I think is
absolutely abhorrent.
This resolution reflects the Financial
Services Committee’s longstanding em-
phasis that we have on protecting our
national security and ensuring the in-
tegrity of the financial system. The
size and scope of that system, along
with the preeminent role of the U.S.
dollar in global trade, requires us to re-
main vigilant against illicit finance,
money laundering, and other signifi-
cant threats.
Already this Congress, the House has
passed several of our committee’s bills
designed to identify new risks in illicit
finance and to strengthen our banks’
cooperation with law enforcement au-
thorities. We are also looking forward
to addressing a more comprehensive re-
form of processes under the Bank Se-
crecy Act in order to crack down on
money laundering much more effec-
tively.
We believe technology can be a great
driver of those reforms and more effi-
ciently and effectively enforce those
laws. We are working together to
achieve that bipartisan outcome and
update to that very important piece of
legislation. This, I think, represents a
down payment, rhetorically, on that
interest that we have of combating il-
licit finance wherever it may be.
I hope that we can continue to en-
gage in a meaningful way in that bipar-
tisan dialogue to achieve reforms to
the Bank Secrecy Act, with the under-
standing it is important to safeguard
our national security, while upholding
a financial system that is open, trans-
parent, and efficient and that is, in
many ways, the envy of the rest of the
world, without unduly burdening busi-
nesses in a manner that ends up turn-
ing away legitimate trade and com-
merce. Striking that balance is obvi-
ously that fine art that this Congress
seeks to do, and we hope to do that
well coming out of our committee.
Now, Republicans and Democrats
should also be able to agree that these
laws and regulations require us to
strike a balance. That has to be a stat-
ed objective, and I am hopeful that the
chairwoman will continue to work with
us based on that principle. I am en-
couraged by that opportunity on the
Bank Secrecy Act and Illicit Finance
for us to tackle those items.
I thank the chairwoman for spon-
soring this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I
ask my colleagues to support it, and I
reserve the balance of my time.

b 1315
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), who is a senior
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee.
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr.
Speaker, this is a very important and
timely resolution because, in recent
years, the lack of sunlight and trans-
parency in financial transactions and
corporate formation has brought us to
the forefront of the very dangerous role
that dark money plays in our financial
system.
Money laundering; loopholes in mar-
kets like real estate, the arts, and an-
tiquities can be taken advantage of by
criminals who facilitate their nefarious
deeds. And, Mr. Speaker, according to
the Financial Action Task Force, real
estate alone accounted for one-third of
all the criminal assets confiscated
worldwide between 2011 and 2013, in
that 3-year period.
Even more concerning, Mr. Speaker,
is this: some of these transactions are
conducted by anonymous shell compa-
nies who are exploiting loopholes in
our financial system, creating a lack of
transparency for who really is the ben-
eficial owner of the assets.
This is very important, Mr. Speaker.
This critical resolution offered by my
colleague and chairwoman, Ms. MAXINE
WATERS, recognizes how important this
issue is not only to the stability of our
financial system but to the national se-
curity of our great Nation.
It urges that much more be done
with these loopholes and lets us shine a
bright light into the darkest corners of
our financial system.
That is why, Mr. Speaker, I rise to
encourage my colleagues to support
this resolution that will protect our fi-
nancial system from abuse and corrup-
tion. I am hopeful that it will be unani-
mous, with all of our colleagues sup-
porting this important resolution.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GOODEN), my colleague and a new
member of the House Financial Serv-
ices Committee, for the purposes of a
statement.
Mr. GOODEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of H. Res. 206, legisla-
tion that acknowledges the grave
threat that terrorist organizations and
international drug cartels pose to our
Nation’s financial system and eco-
nomic system.
Introduced in the Financial Services
Committee, this resolution reaffirms
that the House of Representatives sup-
ports efforts currently under way in
American and international financial
institutions to identify bad actors and
hold them accountable for their
crimes.
The stakes couldn’t be higher. Just
as financial transparency has already
helped us combat weapons of mass de-
struction, traffickers, corrupt foreign
actors, and terrorist financiers, it also
serves as a powerful weapon against or-
ganized criminal networks.
When criminals like El Chapo seek to
exploit a complex and interconnected
financial system, we must seek to un-
tangle and bring clarity.
As we enhance financial trans-
parency, we diminish a criminal’s abil-
ity to commit crimes. In fact, I would
consider this an important part of
President Trump’s efforts to secure our
borders from those who are actively
trying to infiltrate our country to fi-
nance drug trafficking and other crimi-
nal or terrorist activities.
Just as we need to build the wall at
our southern border to keep out drug
cartels and gangs, we need to be secur-
ing our economy from those who use
the United States to conceal, launder,
and move money generated from illegal
activity.
Given the global nature of money
laundering and terrorist financing, a
secure national and multilateral
framework is essential to the integrity
of our financial system here at home.
Simply put, we should be doing all
that we can to give financial institu-
tions the tools they need to catch
those who support the drug cartels that
infiltrate our southern border or ille-
gally engage in money laundering and
terrorism financing.
For those reasons, I support this res-
olution and would like to thank the
ranking member and Chairwoman
WATERS for the time this afternoon.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GREEN), the chair of the Sub-
committee on Oversight and Investiga-
tions on the Financial Services Com-
mittee.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
would like to join the chorus of persons
who are complimenting the chair-
woman for many jobs well done. This,
of course, is just another of the many
wonderful things that she is doing to
help people across the globe.
Mr. Speaker, I support H. Res. 206 be-
cause it addresses the launderability of
money at the foundation of crimi-
nality.
When it comes to arts and antiq-
uities, according to an Art Basel report
by UBS, the United States remains the
largest art market, valued at $26.6 bil-
lion, and it accounts for 42 percent of
the global total in 2017.
This means, of course, that the
United States is likely to be the larg-
est destination for stolen ethnic and
cultural arts—black market, black
market art, black market money. That
is why we have to find a way to prevent
the laundering of this money.
The United States of America should
not allow ourselves to be the financier
for those who perpetrate dastardly
deeds in many countries around the
world. An example might be Syria,
where you have terrorists who will
take stolen artifacts, find a way to put
them into commerce, and use that
money to support terrorist activities.
That is not what we are about. We
must find a way to close the loopholes
that allow persons in this country to
purchase these artifacts and allow that
money to get back to those who would
perform these dastardly deeds. I call
them dastards. That is with a ‘‘D,’’ das-
tards.
These dastards must be stopped. This
resolution is a great step in the right
direction to prevent the perpetration
and perpetuation of this activity.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. LYNCH), a longtime mem-
ber of the Financial Services Com-
mittee.
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for her leadership on this issue
and also for yielding me this time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of H. Res. 206, a resolution that ac-
knowledges the threat to our national
security posed by loopholes in our fi-
nancial transaction laws.
Today, our anti-money laundering
and antiterrorism finance laws are dan-
gerously outdated. Billions of dollars
in bribes are paid around the world
every year, and the amount of money
laundered globally is estimated to be 2
to 5 percent of global GDP. Far too
much of this cash flow comes through
the United States financial institu-
tions.
The international community agrees.
The Financial Action Task Force—the
global standard-setting body—has said
that we have significant gaps in our se-
curity laws.
By passing this resolution, Congress
can show it understands that illicit fi-
nancing networks are the root and
branch of any terrorist or criminal or-
ganization’s operations.
We can also show that we understand
by addressing those gaps and loopholes
in our laws. We can move toward a
safer society and a safer world.
Money laundering and other financial
crimes support human trafficking, ter-
rorism, and corruption around the
world. These crimes endanger Ameri-
cans every day, and we need to do
more.
I strongly urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to support H.
Res. 206. I want to thank the chair-
woman, again, for her kindness.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to note for the
House that the original draft of this
resolution that was put forward and
made public by committee Democrats
was not one that committee Repub-
licans had vetted. And, in that con-
versation, we had revised the text of
this resolution.
So, out there today is the original
text Chairwoman WATERS had offered.
She undertook, through her staff and
through my staff, and we worked out
the changes, so the language here is
something that should receive unani-
mous approval of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
In fact, it states some very impor-
tant things that we find important in

the House Financial Services Com-
mittee.
Now, if there is illicit financing and
our laws are not detecting it, that is a
problem, is it not? And we should ad-
dress that problem, however it mani-
fests itself.
And we have two examples here,
using artwork and using real estate;
but we also would use money in order
to possess that artwork, that real es-
tate. So we want to make sure that we
are getting at that money, that flow,
within our financial markets and get-
ting at that.
There is bipartisan agreement, and
the language here is not the original
language Chairwoman WATERS offered
and maybe, perhaps, the one that she
would want to pass. But, in her effort
at bipartisanship, she worked with
committee Republicans, changed the
resolution, and now before us we have
a new resolution.
This new resolution should meet the
approval of everyone in this House.
I want to state that very clearly.
This is not a Democrat product. Actu-
ally, it is because Chairwoman WATERS
did author it, but she was willing to
hear our feedback on the Republican
side. That is helpful.
What this would be is the fifth bill
that we have passed out of the House
Financial Services Committee that has
received bipartisan support. That is a
good sign. That is a good sign, in a bro-
ken Washington, that we can actually
do some sensible things.
And outlined here, this resolution
got out of, really, prescriptive posi-
tions that we are still negotiating on
on this idea of beneficial ownership,
which our colleague, Subcommittee
Chair MALONEY, has been working on
intensely, as have FRENCH HILL from
Arkansas and BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
from Missouri on the Republican side.
And they are still working through
the contents of that, and we are still
not in agreement. So we removed that
language, and I think that is a very
hopeful thing.
I didn’t really want to get into the
mechanics of how we came to this, but
I think it is important for the House to
note that that work has been done. Be-
fore us is a new resolution that should
be able to meet the support of the
House.
Mr. Speaker, I want to finish by say-
ing this, that Chairwoman WATERS said
she would work with us on this; she
worked with us on this. I am grateful
for that.
Recognizing that there are more
Democrats than Republicans in the
House, the gentlewoman could have
passed this resolution if she saw fit, on
a partisan basis, but she thought it was
important to actually have a bipar-
tisan outcome so we can have bipar-
tisan legislating following this.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I cannot
describe how pleased I am working
with Mr. MCHENRY and the way that he
has expressed to you in his presen-
tation how we have worked together,
and I thank him for that. I am very ap-
preciative of that, and I will continue
to work on those issues that the gen-
tleman alluded to.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.
CAROLYN B. MALONEY), the chair of the
Subcommittee on Investor Protection,
Entrepreneurship, and Capital Mar-
kets.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair-
woman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this
very important resolution.
For too long, criminals and terrorists
have used our financial system to laun-
der their dirty money and to hide all of
their assets.
This issue is incredibly important to
me because I have been working on leg-
islation to crack down on anonymous
shell companies for about 10 years, and
Chairwoman WATERS has always been a
strong supporter and is, in fact, an
original cosponsor of my legislation.
So I want to highlight one particular
passage from this resolution which
talks about the pilot program that
FinCEN conducted in 2016 where they
collected beneficial ownership informa-
tion in certain real estate transactions
in Manhattan and Miami.
The findings from the pilot program
were shocking. They found that about
30 percent of the transactions involved
a beneficial owner that had previously
been the subject of a suspicious activ-
ity report from a bank, which strongly
suggests that criminals and other bad
actors are using anonymous shell com-
panies to launder or hide money.
Requiring companies to disclose their
beneficial owners would provide trans-
parency to law enforcement. It would
also protect Americans from terrorism
financing by cracking down on the
ability of terrorists to get financing in
our country. And it would also help fi-
nancial institutions keep the bad ac-
tors out of the financial system.
That is why I have been working so
hard to pass my beneficial ownership
bill, and I look forward to continuing
to work in a bipartisan way with Rank-
ing Member MCHENRY and others to ad-
dress this important issue.
I must say that this issue was
brought to me by law enforcement, and
they told me they will be tracking
money that they think is terrorism fi-
nancing. They hit an LLC; they cannot
get any more information about who
owns this real estate or company in
our country. We have to stop that.
So I strongly urge support for the
chairwoman’s resolution, and I urge
my colleagues to support it as well and
to support the bipartisan beneficial
ownership bill which will shortly be on
the floor.
b 1330
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I want to reiterate that what my col-
league, Mrs. MALONEY, the chair of the
Subcommittee on Investor Protection,
Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets
outlined, outlined is an ongoing con-
versation we are having on her piece of
legislation around beneficial owner-
ship. We are still working through that
process. I think the talks have been
productive, but there is a lot of work
to do. There is not quite consensus yet
on how we achieve that right balance.
Notwithstanding that, you have to
look at the contents of the resolution
before us. I think this is, while not per-
fect—if I had drafted the resolution, I
would have also included the inter-
national drug trade and human traf-
ficking as two highly important areas
that need our attention and focus as
policymakers. But that is a sin of
omission rather than commission.
I would also target a broader set of
regimes. ISIS is targeted in this, and I
think that is strong. We have bipar-
tisan agreement that we have to fight
this terrorism network and evil ide-
ology that they have put upon the
world, and how they act out in this,
and we have to have a concerted effort,
as Americans, in a bipartisan way, to
fight them.
I would also add to that the regimes
in China, Russia, and North Korea as
other state actors that are doing really
horrible things in terms of cyber
threats, but also through money laun-
dering—not just a regime, but there
are a lot of regimes around the world.
So this is not a complete resolution,
but I think it is worthy of our support.
I think this is a first step in that
longer conversation about modernizing
the Bank Secrecy Act and making sure
that we are targeting illicit financing.
I ask my colleagues to vote for this
resolution, and I look forward to con-
tinuing the conversation with my
Democratic colleagues on more bipar-
tisan outcomes.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
I include in the RECORD the following
letter of general support for H. Res. 206

March 13, 2019
combat terrorist financing, money laun-
dering and other criminal activities. We
strongly agree with many of the points
raised in H. Res 206 as they pertain to the
collection of this information and we look
forward to working with the Committee on
Financial Services and the Subcommittee on
National Security, International Develop-
ment and Monetary Policy to address these
issues, in the months ahead.
For years, the FOP has supported the col-
lection of beneficial ownership information
and we’ve been proud to partner with Rep-
resentatives Carolyn B. Maloney (D–NY) and
Peter T. King (R–NY) on legislation entitled
the ‘‘Corporate Transparency Act ‘‘ A discus-
sion draft sharing that same title is being
considered by the committee today and the
FOP is once again prepared to support this
important legislation.
Transnational criminal organizations and
terrorist operations are using our banks, fi-
nancial institutions and other means to prof-
it from their illegal activity This is a well-
documented problem for our financial insti-
tutions and for law enforcement as we work
together to shut down these sophisticated
criminal enterprises.
Congress and this committee have played a
leadership role in identifying the problem
and working with law enforcement to de-
velop legislation like the ‘‘Corporation
Transparency Act.’’ In addition, this Admin-
istration also agrees with this approach—
last July U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Ste-
ven T. Mnuchin testified before this com-
mittee and stated that there is a real need to
‘‘have access to beneficial ownership infor-
mation for law enforcement and for com-
bating terrorist financing.’’
The Secretary’s remarks were very clear
that this is a pressing issue and the vulner-
ability of our financial institutions poses a
genuine threat to public safety and national
security. Under current laws, shell corpora-
tions may be used as front organizations by
criminals conducting illegal activity such as
money laundering, fraud, and tax evasion.
Legislation like the ‘‘Corporation Trans-
parency Act’’ and other measures identified
in H. Res. 206, propose to combat this misuse
of U.S. corporations by requiring the U.S.
Department of the Treasury, specifically the
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FinCEN), to collect beneficial ownership in-
formation for corporations and limited li-
ability companies formed under State laws
unless the State is already collecting this in-
formation. It is vital that such information,
once collected, be available to law enforce-
ment at every level—local, State, tribal and
Federal—upon a lawful request. The sharing
of this information will help speed the abil-
ity of law enforcement to investigate any
possible connection between these corpora-
tions and terrorist funding.
All too often, investigations will hit a dead
end when we encounter a company with hid-
den ownership. Just as robbers or burglars
wear masks to hide their faces and make
identifying them more difficult; the crimi-
nals we are chasing in these cases use shell
corporations as masks, concealing them-
selves while still profiting from their crimes.
When we are able to expose the link between
shell companies and drug trafficking, corrup-
tion, organized crime and terrorist finance,
law enforcement will be able to bring these
criminals to justice and make our citizens
and our nation safer.
We would also like to raise our concerns
about proposals that would increase the
monetary threshold for filing Currency
Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity
Reports, thereby reducing the information
law enforcement currently receives. It is not
clear what policy or public safety aim such a
change is intended to accomplish. Organized
criminal enterprises are already aware of the
current thresholds and often take steps to
avoid triggering these alerts and bringing
scrutiny to their operations. Increasing
these thresholds may negatively impact law
enforcement and investigations into money
laundering and other financial crimes.
On behalf of the more than 345,000 members
of the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to
thank this committee for its leadership on
this issue and most of all, for its willingness
to engage and work with the law enforce-
ment community on the collection of bene-
ficial ownership information. By working to-
gether, I believe we can make our financial
system and our nation safer from criminal
and terrorist organizations. If I can provide
any additional information on this matter,
please do not hesitate to contact me or my
Executive Director, Jim Pasco, in my Wash-
ington office.
Sincerely,
CHUCK CANTERBURY,
National President.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, as we
join together during this Sunshine
Week to highlight the importance of
transparency in our economy and our
national security, and the preservation
of our rule of law, we cannot ignore the
insidious harm that is being done by
institutions like Deutsche Bank,
Danske Bank, and others that facili-
tate money laundering and financial
crime.
Kleptocracy and corruption around
the world and here at home, as the
Trump family and its companies have
proven, can only thrive with the co-
operation or willful blindness from fi-
nancial institutions that move, hide,
and launder their ill-gotten money,
money that can come in and out of the
financial system through investments
in real estate, art, and other luxury
markets across America.
I hope my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle would agree that we need to
close loopholes that allow criminals
and terrorists to hide from sunlight
and scrutiny, and I urge the House to
support H. Res. 206, as amended.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
WATERS) that the House suspend the
rules and agree to the resolution, H.
Res. 206, as amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to.
The title of the resolution was
amended so as to read: ‘‘Acknowl-
edging that the lack of sunlight and
transparency in financial transactions
poses a threat to our national security
and our economy’s security and sup-
porting efforts to close related loop-
holes.’’.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

REMEMBERING LOUISE
SLAUGHTER
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, a year
ago this week, our country lost one of
its greatest legislators, Congress-
woman Louise Slaughter.
In her 33 years in Congress, Louise
Slaughter never backed down from a
righteous fight. Here is just one exam-
ple of Congresswoman Slaughter’s grit.
When she arrived in Congress, every
single clinical trial at the National In-
stitutes of Health was aimed at White
men, so Congresswoman Slaughter se-
cured the first $500 million of Federal
funding for breast cancer research.
My father and I both had the privi-
lege to serve alongside Congresswoman
Slaughter. We knew her as a fierce
champion for women and workers
throughout the country. There was
something disarming about her Ken-
tucky drawl that really made you feel
at home. She was a thoughtful leader
who could cut bad ideas down with her
wit and determination.
Every time I left her presence, I left
with a smile. Congresswoman Slaugh-
ter was truly one of the best human
beings I ever met in my life. Her life-
time of service to this Nation will be
celebrated by the American people for
decades.
f
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION
SURVIVORS PROTECTION
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, a
few minutes ago, I rose to call for a
vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act, which requires
any baby who survives an abortion to
receive the same medical care that any
baby born at the same age would re-
ceive. It requires the baby to then be
transported to a hospital.
As a doctor, I strongly believe that
every patient, especially these infants
born alive, should be given appropriate
medical care. This should not even be a
question.
New York recently celebrated pass-
ing a law that removes protections
from babies born alive after an abor-
tion attempt. Other States also fail to
protect abortion survivors.
Therefore, it is our duty, as Members
of Congress, to defend the God-given
right to life for every baby in this situ-
ation. It is our duty, as compassionate
human beings, to ensure that these
uniquely vulnerable babies receive the
care that they deserve.
It is past time to vote on H.R. 962.
f
REMEMBERING LOUISE
SLAUGHTER
(Ms. SHALALA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker,
today, I would like to speak about my
dear friend, Congresswoman Louise
Slaughter.
Louise was larger than life, a force of
nature, and a trailblazer for women.
She was an embodiment of her dis-
trict’s long history in the women’s
rights movement, going back to Susan
B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass.
She would have been so proud to see
the record number of women elected to
Congress this year. She would have
been an extraordinary mentor. She was
the best retail politician I have ever
known.
I have never served in this body with
Louise, but, as a Cabinet member, I
knew her well and joined her in her dis-
trict eight times and had numerous
phone calls over the years.

She held degrees in microbiology and
public health. Her knowledge of health
policy and her political smarts helped
her shepherd critical legislation.
Thanks to Louise, we have the Afford-
able Care Act, the Violence Against
Women Act, and the Genetic Informa-
tion Nondiscrimination Act, just to
name a few.
She was the first chairwoman of the
Rules Committee. I am proud to now
serve on this committee. It is Louise’s
spirit that keeps all of us going
through long Rules Committee meet-
ings. We should all aspire to be the per-
son she was, to tirelessly serve our con-
stituents, the Constitution, and this

HONORING JOHN POPRIK
(Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
it is with a heavy heart that I rise
today to honor the life and the memory
of a very special member of our Bucks
County community, John Poprik, who
our community recently lost.
Born in Philadelphia, John attended
Father Judge High School and Drexel
University, where he graduated in 1970
with a degree in accounting. He was a
respected business executive, having
served as the CFO of Better Material
Corp. before becoming the CFO of
Sommer Maid Creamery.
John was truly a dedicated man,
dedicated to making our community a
better place through public service. He
served on the Water and Sewer Author-
ity, the Bucks County Drug and Alco-
hol Commission, and the Pennsylvania
Unemployment Compensation Board of
Review.
More than anything, however, John
was a dedicated family man. He spent
some of his most treasured moments
with his five grandchildren.
Madam Speaker, I extend my deepest
condolences to his beloved wife of 50
years, my dear friend, Pat Poprik, and
their sons, Brad and Matt.
May John, a good, decent, and honor-
able man, enjoy the eternal reward for
a life he spent serving others.

REMEMBERING LOUISE
SLAUGHTER
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, 1 year
ago, this body and our Nation lost one
of its brightest lights with the passing
of an extraordinary congresswoman
and my dear friend, Louise Slaughter.
I first came to know Louise in the
early 1980s when we served together in
the New York State Assembly. We re-
mained close until her passing on
March 16, 2018. While I will always miss
her presence, her legacy lives on in
many, many ways.
It lives on in the renaming of the
STOCK Act, an effort that I was proud
to sponsor last Congress.
Louise’s legacy lives on in the
Fairport post office, renamed after
Louise and her husband, Bob, a fitting
tribute to a loving couple. I thank my
colleague, JOE MORELLE, for making
that happen.
Her legacy lives in the Rochester
train station, named after Louise after
years of her advocacy and determina-
tion to make it an improved destina-
tion and a special place of connection.
Most importantly, her legacy lives in
the freshman class of this United
States House of Representatives. Lou-
ise used to represent Seneca Falls and
was proud of the women’s rights move-
ment that had its strongest, deepest
roots in upstate New York.
This year, more than 100 women
serve in this body for the first time in
American history. Of course, if Louise
were here, she would surely remind us
that 100 is much less than half of 435
and that our work was far from over.
Madam Speaker, to my friend, Lou-
ise, our thoughts and prayers are with
her as we mark 1 year since her pass-
ing. Today, we celebrate an incredible
legacy, a legacy that is alive and burn-
ing bright with hope.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
AMERICAN LEGION
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate The American Legion on its
centennial anniversary.
On Friday, March 15, The American
Legion will celebrate 100 years since it
was formed in Paris, France, after
World War I. More than 1,000 people
gathered for The American Legion’s
first caucus at the American Club in
Paris on March 15, 1919.
Since then, The American Legion has
grown to be the Nation’s largest war-
time veterans service organization,
boasting more than 2 million members
and 13,000 posts across all 50 States, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,
France, Mexico, and the Philippines.
Its dedication to veterans, service-
members, and their families extends
from local community programs to
State and Federal policy initiatives,
including the establishment of the Vet-
erans Administration in 1930 and the
GI Bill in 1944. Hundreds of local Amer-
ican Legion programs and activities
strengthen the Nation one community
at a time.
Madam Speaker, I thank The Amer-
ican Legion for its service and wish its
members a happy 100th birthday this
Friday.

HONORING DONALD HERBERT
EATON, JR.
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker,
New York suffered a heartbreaking loss
with the passing of Donald Herbert
Eaton, Jr., a Harlem native, a Korean
war veteran, and an accomplished com-
munity activist.
His life was marked by selflessness
and perseverance, common threads
that guided him to serve his commu-
nity and his Nation.
He was raised in a tough environ-
ment. Discrimination was at its peak.
Yet, when his Nation called on him, he
went to war and served honorably as a
member of the 369th ‘‘Harlem
Hellfighters’’ Infantry Regiment.
Upon his return, Eaton’s long-
standing commitment to service led
him to spend 20 years leading efforts to
help those in need: veterans, seniors,
and the underprivileged.
Madam Speaker, may he rest in
peace and may God comfort his chil-
dren, Donald Eaton III and Geoffrey
Eaton, Sr., and his two grandchildren,
Geoffrey Eric Eaton, Jr., and Geoffrey
S. Eaton III.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, cele-
brated each March, Women’s History
Month serves as a time to honor and
recognize the momentous achievement
of women who have continued to shape
the United States today.
What began as a week-long celebra-
tion in 1981 is now a month-long cele-
bration starting in 1995.
This year, I am especially proud to
highlight a group of women making
history right now in Texas’ Third Con-
gressional District. Collin County,
Texas, has 11 State district courts with
11 presiding judges, and 7 county courts
at law with 7 presiding judges.
In 2017, an addition of a new judge
brought the total number of female
judges serving on district courts to six,
meaning that, for the first time in his-
tory, a majority of the court seats are
now held by women. But just this year,
with the election of another woman in
Texas’ 219th district court, there are
now seven women serving on the coun-
ty’s district benches. Making this ac-
complishment even more remarkable,
just 12 years ago, there was only one
female judge on the county’s benches.
While only 33 percent of the judges
throughout the United States are
women, Collin County is leading the
way with 64 percent of the district
court judge benches held by women
judges.
I salute Judge Corinne Mason, Judge
Angela Tucker, Judge Jennifer Edge-
worth, Judge Andrea Thompson, Judge
Cynthia Wheless, Judge Jill Willis,
Judge Piper McCraw, and Judge Emily
Miskel.

PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BUDGET
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, on
Monday, the Trump administration re-
leased what has to be the cruelest and
most irresponsible proposed budget in
our Nation’s 243-year history.
The Trump budget adds trillions of
dollars to our national debt. The
Trump budget cuts $1.5 trillion from
Medicaid, $845 billion from Medicare,
and $26 billion from Social Security.
Meanwhile, it cuts over 90 percent of
the funding for freshwater in the Great
Lakes Restoration Initiative.
We are not going to be able to com-
bat deadly algal blooms in Lake Erie.
We are not going to be able to contain
invasive species like the Asian carp.
We are not going to be able to restore
the Great Lakes and its environmental
integrity.
The President promised he would
never cut Social Security, Medicare, or
Medicaid, yet he has done exactly that.
His proposed budget adds trillions to
the national debt while also under-
mining the financial pillars of Medi-
care, Social Security, and Medicaid.
Madam Speaker, budgets are a reflec-
tion of our values, and President
Trump’s values are clearly with the 1
percent. He is out of step with the ma-
jority of the American people and,
surely, those living in northern Ohio.

REMEMBERING LOUISE
SLAUGHTER
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to join my colleagues in pay-
ing tribute to my dear friend and pred-
ecessor, Louise Slaughter.
As evidenced by the many laudatory
statements being made today, Louise’s
contributions to this institution were
immeasurable. Louise left a remark-
able legacy:
The only woman to chair the Rules
Committee;
A stalwart for women and children;
A leader who was instrumental in
passing landmark healthcare legisla-
tion.
But what I remember most about
Louise and what was at the heart of all
her accomplishments is how much she
cared for her friends and for her com-
munity.
Louise was my dear friend not only
on the best of days, like when she en-
couraged me to run for my first elec-
tive office or celebrated with me when
I was chosen to be the majority leader
of the New York State Assembly, but
also on the most difficult of days.
When my daughter Lauren passed
away, Louise was there that afternoon
spending hours at my house with our
family. That is just who she was.
She had one of the biggest hearts of
anyone I know. I am better for having
known her, and I know that our entire
country is better for her many years of
dedicated service.
May you rest in peace, Louise
Slaughter.

REMEMBERING LOUISE

(Ms. SPEIER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today with my colleagues to honor my
friend and colleague, Congresswoman
Louise Slaughter.
It is inconceivable to me that it has
been 1 year since the passing of this
force of nature. I am consoled by know-
ing that her legacy lives on in this
Chamber.
The brilliant former chair of the pow-
erful Rules Committee was sharp-
tongued, sharp-witted, and sharp-eyed.
Everyone who knew her was made
better by her presence.
Anyone who came up against her in
an argument knew they were facing a
steel backbone, but her disarming
sense of humor and southern drawl
were irresistible.
She even taught me how to speak
Southern. ‘‘Bless your sweet heart’’
doesn’t mean bless your sweet heart.
Congresswoman Slaughter knew fake
when she saw it and was not afraid to
call it out. She knew truth when she
saw it and stood strong in its defense.
It is in her honor that we must con-
tinue to fight for this democracy that
she never gave up on, and I hope that
we will consider naming the Rules
Committee room in her honor.
There are many people I like in our
Chamber; few, I truly love. I loved Lou-
ise Slaughter.

REMEMBERING LOUISE
SLAUGHTER
(Ms. MATSUI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, a year
ago we said good-bye to Louise Slaugh-
ter, our dear, dear, friend.
Louise Slaughter was a titan of Con-
gress. She was unforgettable.
When I first joined the Rules Com-
mittee after getting elected, I was im-
mediately drawn to Louise. Louise
took me under her wing. She even
made fun of people that I thought were
really wonderful, and she laughed be-
cause she knew we shared a joke.
Honestly, Louise was somebody who
even made the late hours in the Rules
Committee fun, too, with her wittiness
and her intellect and the fact that, be-
neath it all, she absolutely loved serv-
ing in this wonderful House.
Louise lived in perfect balance. She
was charming, yet intense; witty, yet
resolute.
After spending time with Louise, you
knew her heart was with the people of
western New York, and you knew she
wasn’t going to back down from her be-
liefs.
She loved her family. She loved her
district as if they were her family,
also. And we loved Louise because she
loved everyone and gave support.
We miss you, Louise.

(Mr. LEWIS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1

marks.)
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I first
met Louise Slaughter 32 years ago dur-
ing our freshman orientation. From
the first day, she stood out.
Louise was an unbelievable, kind,
beautiful person. She was a born leader
who was thoughtful, mindful, and she
didn’t take any stuff.
I loved Louise. She called me Brother
John, and I called her Sister Louise.
We miss Louise.
I can see her standing up on this
floor now speaking truth to power. She
never gave up; she never gave in; she
kept her faith; and she kept her eyes
on the prize.
Madam Speaker, I thank Louise for
her service, and I know she is with her
beloved Bob.

REMEMBERING LOUISE
SLAUGHTER
(Ms. MOORE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I am
so blessed to have known Louise
McIntosh Slaughter, and I am so
pleased to speak on her behalf today.
Louise was a legislator, with a cap-
ital L, and she lived up to the legacy of
the ladies of New York. She rep-
resented Seneca Falls, and not only be-
cause it was her district, but she rep-
resented it in terms of her sentiments.
She was the sponsor of the Violence
Against Women Act. She was the head
of the Pro-Choice Caucus. She focused
on medical research for women.
She was a thought leader. Consistent
with her training in chemistry, she
fought to decrease the amount of anti-
biotics, eliminate antibiotics in ani-
mals for consumption. She led on the
issues of getting rid of lead, and, also,
she really understood chemistry.
The first time she saw Bob Slaugh-
ter, she said, ‘‘I have just got to have
him,’’ and she went and got him.
She was a bridge to leadership. These
freshmen would have really, really en-
joyed being around the head of the
Rules Committee, their bridge to the
leadership.
And let me tell you, I loved her be-
cause she really knew how to make
people happy. Madam Speaker, she
gave me an orange purse because she
thought that orange was a happy color
and that I deserved to be surrounded by
it.

(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, it
is fitting that we are honoring Con-
gresswoman Slaughter during Women’s
History Month because her legacy is
planted firmly in the history books.
She wasn’t the daughter of wealth or
privilege, but she traveled from the
coalfields of Kentucky to become the
first woman ever to chair the House
Rules Committee.
Louise’s 30 years of service here em-
bodied what it means to be a public
servant: writing the STOCK Act and
the Genetic Information Non-
discrimination Act, shepherding
through the Affordable Care Act. I
could go on and on.
There was no special interest too in-
fluential for her to take on, no politi-
cian too powerful.
Many of us saw her determination
firsthand, whether we were with her on
an issue or especially if we were on the
opposite side. We are all better for it.
This Chamber and this country are bet-
ter for it.
I am proud to have worked alongside
her. I am glad that she will be joining
so many pioneering women in the Na-
tional Women’s Hall of Fame this year.
Madam Speaker, and on behalf of all
the Members of this Chamber and on
behalf of her staff, especially in the
Rules Committee, let me just say we
loved her, and we miss her a lot.

FIVE PILLARS OF WHAT WE
BELIEVE SAVES US
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
minority leader.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker,
what we are going to do right now is,
and we are going to hopefully only
take about a half an hour, actually
walk through sort of the continuing
theme of how at least our math—and
particularly in our office, we have been
trying to put together sort of a unified
theory of how do we deal with the re-
ality of what is happening in our coun-
try with our demographics. We are get-
ting older much faster, and our birth-
rate has fallen dramatically.
Repeatedly, we have come up here
with other boards that basically show,
over the next 30 years, the greatest
threat to our economy, to our society,
to our country’s priorities, is the fact
that our interest, Social Security,
Medicare, healthcare entitlement costs
consume everything. The rest of the
budget is functionally imbalanced.
I know this is uncomfortable because
it is one of those things that is hard for
us to talk about. It is not Republican
or Democratic. It is demographics. It is
math.
Part of that baseline, to understand
2008 to 2028, take those 20 years, 91 per-
cent of the spending increase here in
Washington, if you remove interest, 91
percent of the spending increase is—ac-
tually, I think it does include inter-
est—interest, Social Security,
healthcare entitlements.
We need to understand the basic
math. And now, how do you actually
deal with it?
How do you maximize economic
growth?
How do you maximize labor force
participation?
How do you encourage people, if we
built the incentives, to actually stay in
the labor force longer?
How do you actually embrace tech-
nology, particularly disruptive tech-
nology that crashes the prices and
makes our society healthier and more
efficient?
And then, how do we have an honest
conversation of those earned benefits
and build them so they have incentives
in there that, if you are fit and healthy
and happy, you are willing to stay in
the labor force longer? Are there cer-
tain spiffs and benefits we can design
into these?
So those are sort of our five pillars.
Today, we are going to do something
that is fun.
We just grabbed a handful of concepts
that are about technology, and the
tough part—when you start talking
about disruptive technology—it makes
you sort of giddy for what the future is
and the opportunities.
But there is this thing we call incum-
bency, particularly in economics—in-
cumbency: the incumbent business; the
incumbent medical provider; the in-
cumbent over here.
These technologies are going to be a
real challenge.
b 1430
The running joke in our office is how
many of us went to Blockbuster Video
last weekend. We sort of woke up one
night and all decided to go home and
hit a button called HBO Go, Netflix,
those things. We no longer stood in line
and got movie suggestions and went
home with a little shiny disc.
We are going to walk through, first,
some of the healthcare IT and why this
is so important. I want you to first
think about some of the technologies
that are starting to roll out.
If you got to take home or had in the
back of the office or we had on the
back of the floor here something that
looked like a gigantic kazoo that you
could blow into and it told you whether
you had the flu or whether you had a
bacterial infection and, instantly, it
could ping your medical records that
you are carrying around both on your
phone or in the cloud and instantly
order your antivirals and they were de-
livered to your house, did we just crash
parts of the price of healthcare? Of
course we did.
Did we just make a lot of incumbent
businesses? We are challenging part of
their business model because you used
this technology instead of going to the
urgent care center or going to the
emergency room or going to the hos-
pital or even going to the pharmacy.
But we have to be willing to think
about these things. These types of
technologies are rolling out all around
us.
An Israeli company—the picture over
in the far corner—actually has, and I
guess it is being certified all across Eu-
rope right now, a desktop blood test
that actually does a whole plethora of
different blood tests with just a few
drops. Remember, we talked about this
10 years ago. It turns out the tech-
nology now actually exists.
In a couple of blog posts, even the
concept of going into an autonomous
healthcare center—and we actually
have about 10 of these up in the Phoe-
nix area where you go in and sign up on
an iPad. You take a picture of your
driver’s license and a picture of your
insurance card.
You go into a booth alone. You put
your arm in this thing. It does blood
pressure and does a number of read-
ings. You pick up this particular tool,
and an avatar on the screen says: Can
you shine this down your throat? Can
you bend? Can you turn? Now do your
ears, your eyes. It actually does algo-
rithmic healthcare.
What if that few-drop blood test—ac-
tually, as a couple of blog posts talked
about, you put your hand on something
and it pricks your finger. It takes the
blood test right there, and before you
walk out the door, 5 minutes later, it is
giving you a full blood workup.
What did you just do using tech-
nology to disrupt parts of healthcare
costs?
These things are real. They are roll-
ing out right now. There are amazing
technologies in almost everything you
can think of. But we are going to have
to think about both the ecosystem and
the complications of how it is paid

for—are these things that Medicare,
Medicaid, and other insurers will pay
for?—and how we do it.
Also, the data. What happens in a so-
ciety where you are now going to be
walking around with certain
wearables?
You have the fancy watch that helps
you manage your hypertension, the
patch that does your blood oxygen, the
port that helps you actually manage
your blood sugar. There is lots of data
coming off of those wearables. We, in
our office, call them digiceuticals. How
does that all tie into the rest of the
ecosystem?
And that data, how do you actually
get that data so a doctor or the algo-
rithm can see, when you open your pill
bottle—because the pill bottle has a
sensor in it, we know when you took
your pill, and 15 minutes later we see
this on your EKG that is coming from
your watch, we see this reaction, can
that data become incredibly usable?
Can that data be blinded from your
own personal information and help all
of society get healthier because we
gained more data in those algorithms?
This is cutting edge, but it is not uto-
pianism. We actually have those things
right now today.
If you start to think about it, you
can actually go to Amazon, or I am
sure others online, and see that it ex-
ists today. For under a couple of thou-
sand dollars, you can buy a handheld
ultrasound. Think about that.
Apparently, there are other versions,
faster, better, even ones coming in the
future where the algorithm will actu-
ally read the ultrasound. You hold it
up on your iPhone, and as you are
using this handheld ultrasound to look
at the picture, the algorithm is also
going to help you interpret it.
What did an ultrasound system cost a
few years ago? You can buy this online
today. It exists, and we are doing ex-
periments with it right now in a VA, I
believe, just right here in Maryland.
Apparently, they are having terrific
outcomes because the doctor can walk
up and check something.
These technologies exist. How do we
start to have these technologies start
to disrupt the price of healthcare? Be-
cause to be absolutely intellectually
honest, if you actually look at the Af-
fordable Care Act, ObamaCare, or Re-
publican alternatives, we have spent a
couple of decades in this body having a
debate on who pays, not how to dis-
rupt.
With the ACA, we are going to have
government pay a lot more. Over here,
in our version, we are going to try to
create incentives to have individuals
actually get market competition.
They have been debates on paying.
We have almost never stepped up and
said: What are our barriers at the State
level? What are our barriers at the reg-
ulatory level? What are the barriers at
the HHS levels that actually prevent
the adoption of disruptive tech-
nologies?
These things do exist today. We need
to actually embrace the concept of
rapid disruptive adoption of these tech-
nologies because, remember our five
pillars, if we do not have a disruption
in the cost of healthcare as we are get-
ting older very quickly as a society, re-
member, in only 9 years, we have two
workers for every one person in retire-
ment.
In 9 years, if you pull interest out,
half the spending here coming out of
Washington, D.C., will be to those 65
and older, and it is, substantially,
healthcare.
We all carry around these
smartphones. Should our health
records be on those? Of course they
should be, because they should be port-
able with us because health data,
health records are going to become
something dramatically different than
the record that is sitting there at the
hospital. It is going to be living.
How many of you ever use something
like Waze or a crowdsource on your
phone? You are going to be having
these things on your body, or the pill
bottle that knows when you opened it.
That data should be living with you so
you are constantly managing.
There is a debate going on with those
folks who build these algorithms. The
fact that you had a surgery 7 years ago
that is sitting on your health record or
the health data that is coming off your
wearables from the last 48 hours, which
one is actually more valuable to your
healthcare? The living data has incred-
ible value in keeping you healthy. We
need to find a way to embrace this and
build this ecosystem.
This next one I put up, even though
there are a dozen, we are going to show
a couple of versions of this just for the
fun of it. Think about the debates we
are having here in Washington, D.C.,
and for those of us on the Ways and
Means Committee in regard to drug
pricing.
We need to fix many of the incen-
tives. We need to actually deal with
the fact that some of the games that
are played on patents and other
things—okay. That is an honest de-
bate. But understand, the data says
that half the pharmaceuticals that will
be picked up at pharmacies today or
delivered in the mail today, half of
them will either not be used or will not
be used properly.
Think about that just conceptually.
Half of the pharmaceuticals that will
be taken home today aren’t going to be
used properly. Is there a data solution?
We have everything from just the pill
bottle top that lets us know that you
opened it and when it opened and
would tag your healthcare record,
hopefully, be portable with you on your
phone so we know that you actually
took it, to actually, now, for those who
may be on the severely mentally ill
side who have certain maintenance
medications that are providing mir-
acles—they actually have a super small
tiny chip that is actually in the pill
itself that we can actually read that we
know you are digesting it, that we
know you took your meds.
Think about it. We need to embrace
these types of technologies, even down
to this type of pill dispenser for some-
one who may have a little more com-
plicated issue where they take some of
their pharmaceuticals either at mul-
tiple times during the day or they have
certain complications.
Here is one that was shown at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las
Vegas about 6 weeks ago. You put your
cup under it and it automatically dis-
penses at a certain time and tells us
what pharmaceuticals were delivered
to you. It is technology dealing with
the fact that we have documented that
half the pharmaceuticals aren’t prop-
erly used or used at all.
It turns out the data that will flow
off of these things actually will help
us. When you have a wisdom tooth
taken out, do you really need 30 pills or
do you need 3? It turns out, the data
from this may actually help us dra-
matically change the way we do pre-
scriptions in the first place.
So I am making the argument, it
turns out that data and technology are
also one of the solutions as we talk
about pharmaceutical pricing.
Now we are actually going to move
on to something else we, as a body—
and this is going to take my brothers
and sisters on the Democratic side and
Republican side. We need to have a
very, hopefully, math-based, honest
conversation about how we are going
to finance miracles that are coming,
and some of them are going to be here
before the end of this year.
We just put up this slide as part of
the thought experiment. In America,
we have about 8,000 Americans who
have hemophilia A. The price range, we
have actually found some documents
that say the blood clotting factors and
those things may be a half million dol-
lars a year to keep that American sta-
ble.
What happens this November or De-
cember—which we are actually very
hopeful is about to happen—when a sin-
gle shot cures hemophilia A? How do
we pay for it? What are we willing to
pay for it? How do you value that in so-
ciety? It is a single shot of a very small
population so it is not like the next
day there is going to be a competitor
drug in the pipeline like we had with
other drugs. In this case, it is a single-
shot cure.
But we actually know that over 50
percent of all of our healthcare expense
is to 5 percent of our brothers and sis-
ters who have chronic conditions. What
happens when we start having miracle
drugs like a genomic biological like
this that is curing diseases that are
part of our brothers and sisters, that 5
percent who actually have the chronic
conditions that consume over half of
our healthcare dollars?
We are actually, as an office, pro-
posing ideas of a type of healthcare
bond so you can actually finance the
adoption of the distribution of these
disruptive, revolutionary drugs and
then pay for it using some of what

would have been the future costs, pull
those forward so you get the disruption
of the future savings.
These individuals are out of that
chronic condition, but we are going to
have to have a very tricky conversa-
tion. How do you price it? What is the
value of a pharmaceutical that is func-
tionally a miracle that cures some-
thing like hemophilia A? How do you
price it? There is only going to be one
producer of it, would be my guess, be-
cause there is such a small population.
There are only 8,000 Americans with
hemophilia A. Is it worth $1.5 million
an injection?
There is actually a math way to get
there dealing with the reality of this is
a population that costs us a quarter of
a million dollars a year to keep them
healthy, and this is the life expectancy.
What was the research cost, because we
want these miracle drugs as part of our
society to help us have that disruption
as part of the holistic theory of tech-
nology, these new miracle drugs that
are coming, to disrupt the future
healthcare costs.
Now, I want you to take this concept
a bit further and spread it beyond
healthcare. Think of some of the crazy
debates we have actually had here on
the floor in regards to—forgive me—en-
vironment. I want to argue with you
that there is a technology disruption
that can make our environment clean-
er but we don’t actually hurt the econ-
omy. We can actually help it grow.
So here is my first thought experi-
ment. This has been a fixation of mine
for a few years here.
Think of the community you live in.
What if tomorrow, instead of today’s
current model—you want to open up a
paint shop or you want to open up a
bakery or this and that. You go out
and fill out forms. You send them down
to the local environmental regulator.
You may also file them with the State.
If you are doing certain types of vola-
tile organics, you may have to file with
the EPA. You are basically filling up
file cabinets. Do filled-up file cabinets
make the environment, the air quality
in your community cleaner?
b 1445
It is an honest concept because we
functionally have a 1938 regulatory
model of file—lots and lots of paper—
maybe even do quarterly audits, maybe
annual audits, fill out more paper, and
fill up file cabinets full of paper that
functionally a lawyer gets to come and
look at a couple years later.
Does that make the environment in
your community cleaner?
What would happen if you had a few
hundred or a few thousand people trav-
eling around in your community that
actually just had the little sensor trav-
eling with them that they were col-
lecting data on hydrocarbons, on vola-
tile organics, and on ozone, and you
could actually see the map of your
community? If all of a sudden you had
a hot spot over here because you find
out you have clowns painting cars in
the backyard of their house, you would
know about it instantly, and the envi-
ronmental regulator, instead of putting
paper in file cabinets, they would get
in, hopefully, their electric vehicle,
and go over and actually stop the
clowns from painting cars in their
backyard.
Which made the environment clean-
er?
The trade-off here is actually very el-
egant because I don’t need you to file
lots of paperwork. I don’t need you to
actually be doing quarterlies and annu-
als because if you screw up, we catch
you instantly.
What made the economy grow, what
reduced the bureaucratic burden in our
society, and what actually made our
communities healthier and cleaner?
It is just technology.
Mr. GAETZ. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I yield to the
gentleman from Florida.
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
With all due respect to the gen-
tleman from Arizona, he is very weird
in that he runs his congressional office
like a think tank where people con-
template the ways that technology can
improve healthcare and the environ-
ment in a nonpartisan way, because
these are not issues that have anything
to do with whether someone is a Re-
publican or a Democrat.
But so many of these ideas that the
gentleman and I have discussed for
years fail to make their way into the
most dynamic economy and market-
place in the world, which is the United
States of America.
So my question for the gentleman is:
How do we go from the innovative
space of great Americans coming up
with sensor technology to action in the
Congress or within our government
that is worthy of the great people we
serve?
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Will the gen-
tleman enter into a colloquy?
Mr. GAETZ. I will.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. The gentleman is
one of my buddies from Florida. He ac-
tually gets this, but he also knows I ac-
tually love the technology disruptions,
because none of us has figured out if it
is Republican or Democrat yet, which
actually makes it possible for us to do
it. Now, eventually, we will break it
into partisan because everything has
become weaponized and partisan
around this body.
But, right now, think of this: this is
a natural gas electric facility. It can
power 5,000 homes. It is up and running
outside Houston. It doesn’t have a
smokestack. All the ACO2, so all the
carbon is captured. They actually came
up with this brilliant technology that
the carbon actually flows through. My
understanding of the engineering is it
helps spin the turbines, and then the
excess carbon that is generated is safe
and sold.
We actually have a tax credit that we
adjusted that hopefully made it more
robust as we did tax reform that if you
want to take some of that carbon you
can put it in concrete, or a piece of
plastic, or do it for certain types of oil
recovery.
Mr. GAETZ. Was it a refundable tax
credit or was it an upfront credit?
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. It is actually a
tax credit according to the amount of
tonnage you produce of ACO2.
Mr. GAETZ. So it is a production tax
credit?
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Yes. But the
beauty of it is that model has said that
we have actually already created a
value on this carbon, and if you don’t
put it into the environment but actu-
ally use it for other things as a filler in
plastics, as a filler in concrete, in put-
ting it back in to the ground to en-
hance recovery, we are already doing
it. This technology isn’t utopianism, it
exists. It is already running.
How many times around here have
we talked about that we can actually
have a hydrocarbon generation without
a smokestack?
The technology exists. If we are
going to talk about a green agenda,
then we actually all need to sit down
and actually meet with the really
smart researchers and scientists and
actually understand the math and
science. That science is way ahead of
where our heads are.
The gentleman from Florida has
some amazing technologies coming out
of his State right now on everything
from biogeneration to the ways to
manage the environment.
Mr. GAETZ. I would ask the gen-
tleman, as we try to take these good
ideas that seem to not be emerging
from the Federal Government but from
several States and from local commu-
nities that are doing some of their own
great work, I feel at times like you
have got one party here that thinks
that Big Government is always the an-
swer, and you have another party who
thinks that big business is always the
answer, and at times these techno-
logical solutions come from neither.
They come from the creative class, the
innovative class.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. That is actually
a brilliant way to phrase it.
My continuing thought experiment,
and this is a little beyond where we
were going, but it makes the point,
visit Washington, D.C., or a bunch of
other locations now. They are not
going to give you a straw or they are
going to give you a paper straw.
The math is—and this actually, I be-
lieve, comes from the United Nations—
90 percent of all the plastic in the
ocean—and, look, it is a big deal. I am
looking at my data here, roughly 8 mil-
lion tons a year of plastic goes in to
the ocean. The gentleman is from a
coastal State—comes from 10 rivers,
eight of them in Asia, two of them in
Africa.
If you actually really cared about
plastic in the ocean, that 8 million
tons, we would actually take our envi-
ronmental policy, our trade policy, and

our foreign aid policy and say that we
are going to actually help these 10 riv-
ers that are responsible for 90 percent
of the plastic in the ocean and work on
those. But instead we do these feel-
good, absurd, theatrical things of ‘‘my
community isn’t going to do straws,
don’t we feel better that we did some-
thing for plastic in the ocean?’’
It had nothing to do with plastic in
the ocean. It is these 10 rivers. Let’s
grow up and stop the political theater.
Mr. GAETZ. So what is the get-out-
of-jail-free card so that we can liberate
ourselves from a policymaking climate
that seems to be more robust in virtue
signaling than in actually following
data?
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I knew you were
going to say virtue signaling.
This is a little bit sarcastic, and I
mean it to be slightly on the humor
side, one of the first things every Mem-
ber of Congress should put into their
budgets is the ownership of a calcu-
lator, because we functionally work in
a math-free zone where our feelings be-
come public policy instead of the base-
line data where we can actually have
an impact of making our society and
the world healthier and more economi-
cally prosperous. If you actually, genu-
inely cared about plastic in the ocean,
we have 10 rivers, 90 percent of the
plastic, we know exactly where they
are; focus there, instead of the absurd-
ity of the straw at your local whatever.
Mr. GAETZ. I appreciate the gen-
tleman mentioning our oceans. As
someone from a coastal State that
means a great deal to me.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Coming from Ari-
zona we have sort of this utopian view
that one day Arizona may become a
coastal State.
Mr. GAETZ. Based on the current
rate of climate change you may get
your wish.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Or an earth-
quake.
Mr. GAETZ. It doesn’t strike me as
an enviable outcome. I do thank the
gentleman again for yielding for this
discussion.
It is my sincere hope that this is a
discussion that we can have with Mem-
bers of Congress from urban districts,
rural districts, liberal Members, and
conservative Members, because as the
gentleman correctly points out, these
are actually solutions that do not lend
themselves to a partisan tilt.
I am sincerely hopeful that the gen-
tleman will continue to lead on this
subject, and I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. You are very
kind, and I thank you for the colloquy.
Look, many of us just want to solve
the problems. I have the best little girl
in the world sitting in the back right
now. She is 3 years old.
What does her future get to be like?
We have a demographic crisis. It is
just math. We are getting older very
quickly. If we don’t grow the economy,
if we don’t have lots of labor force par-
ticipation, and if we don’t use trade
and tax policy and innovation, we need
these things to grow.
But instead, Madam Speaker, if you
listen to the speeches that often end up
behind these microphones, it is an ab-
surdity that is partisan because we
care about power more than actually
doing those things that are so impor-
tant for our future of this society.
So I want to give you one last, ulti-
mate thought experiment. I am still
just stunned this article hasn’t gotten
more coverage around the country, but
it is going to require many of us to ac-
tually deal with some of our political
constituencies that have lots of folk-
lore built into their belief systems.
About 6 weeks ago, an article came
out. University of Illinois U.S. Agricul-
tural Research Service published a
paper saying—now, you all remember
your high school or your first botany
class or when you were actually learn-
ing about cell biology—there is actu-
ally a weird inefficiency in plant cells
on how they grab a carbon molecule or
oxygen molecule—we won’t geek out
too much—but they found a way
through a bit of genetic engineering to
make the cell wall superefficient.
They basically believe that they have
broken the Holy Grail that plants,
commodity crops—right now they did
it on tobacco plants, because the rea-
son they do research on tobacco plants
is we have known the genome of to-
bacco plants for quite a while now—40
percent increase in efficiency.
We have got to think this through.
Now, there is a really disruptive side of
that. Forty percent, tomorrow if you
could plant a corn seed or wheat or
something else, and it had 40 percent
more yield, what does that mean to
feeding the world 50 years from now?
Yay.
What does that mean to commodity
prices?
Scary.
But you need functionally now 40
percent less land, 40 percent less water,
40 percent less fuel, and we actually
have some data here from the IPCC
2014 report which is from the United
Nations that just a little under one-
quarter of all the human emissions,
functionally greenhouse gases, come
from agriculture.
If you do the math—think about
this—this 40 percent increase in yield
for agriculture would functionally
equal removing every car off the face
of the Earth.
Think about the conversations we
have here talking about the environ-
ment. Here is a miracle. And the re-
ality we know from other disruptions
in seeds that it can be rolled into soci-
ety very quickly as these new seed
stocks, except we are going to have to
deal with our brothers and sisters say-
ing: well, that is a genetically modified
seed.
Yes, but it has this amazing disrup-
tion in the world. If you truly care
about greenhouse gases, if that is your
fixation, just moving to this new dis-
ruptive technology that I hope is real,
I hope the research continues to dem-
onstrate a 40 percent production in-
crease, this here could be the fastest,
biggest disruption in greenhouse gases
in the world because you could actu-
ally adopt these seed crops within just
a few years.
That is an example of technology not
just bringing a small improvement or
even a disruption, in many ways it is a
major disruption, but you have to deal
with the politics of belief systems. It is
genetically modified, but it is not a ge-
netically modified seed stock to deal
with pests or this and that, they just
dealt with the inefficiency of the cell
wall. It is a miracle. If it is true, it is
a miracle. Think about it, though, but
understand the disruptions that are
going to roll through our society.
What happens to the value of agricul-
tural land?
What happens to the ability of na-
tions to ultimately feed themselves if
all of a sudden they had a 40 percent in-
crease in productivity?
But also what happens in our world if
I come to you right now, Madam
Speaker, and say that agriculture pro-
duces functionally, by my math, a bit
more than 21⁄2 times the amount of
emissions of every car on the Earth?
So this technology would be as if you
just removed every car off the Earth.
How come we don’t have these types
of conversations here on the floor?
It is because it doesn’t fit our polit-
ical folklore model of what has become
just a stunningly partisan gotcha
weaponized body.
As we go through our five pillars for
the future one more time, the reason
for the fixation on this, we have 74 mil-
lion of our brothers and sisters who are
baby boomers, the last baby boomer
hits 65 in 9 years, many of the things
we should have done we should have
done a decade or two decades ago, and
we didn’t have the political appetite.
We have to deal with the reality that
we have this population bubble that is
getting older and our birthrates have
substantially collapsed.
If we are going to keep our promises
to those folks who have worked their
entire lives who will be moving into
their benefit years, we have to think
disruptively. We have to be willing to
do everything from tax policy, trade
policy, and regulatory policy that we
have talked about here using tech-
nology, to labor force participation, en-
couraging people all up and down the
spectrum to actually enter the labor
force.
We have to be willing to talk about
redesigning some of the programs to
incentivize, if you wish to work, you
get to work. We are going to have to
actually also embrace the miracle of
these disruptive technologies and not
be scared of them.
But this body is going to also have to
deal with something that is very dif-
ficult for a political body, and that is a
lot of our friends are going to either
have to change their economic models
and a lot of our States are going to

have to change their regulatory models

robustness to actually keep our prom-
ises over the next 30 years.

MEDICARE FOR ALL ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) is recognized for
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on the
subject of the Special Order today.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan?
There was no objection.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I am
honored to co-chair this Special Order
for the Congressional Progressive Cau-
cus with my amazing colleague from
California, KATIE PORTER.
This is a privilege for me to be able
to work with so many of my colleagues
on the issues that they are very pas-
sionate about, from healthcare to envi-
ronmental justice to LGBTQ rights. It
has been an honor to lead this and to
be part of this.
Today, we are talking about an im-
portant, important issue to one of my
colleagues whom I have known for over
15 years as a community organizer and,
later, as an immigration rights attor-
ney working on civil rights issues. It is
an honor to introduce my colleague
from the State of Washington, the
leader on healthcare for all, our won-
derful, great colleague, Representative
PRAMILA JAYAPAL.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Ms.
JAYAPAL).
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, let
me say how pleased I am to be with Ms.
TLAIB today, leading the Special Order
hour, and, Madam Speaker, how
pleased I am to see you at the podium.
This is a fantastic group of individ-
uals who have joined us here in Con-
gress, and I couldn’t be prouder to
serve with both of you and with others
who are here as well.
The topic of this Special Order hour
is so important. It has been important
to me, of course, but also to Members
of Congress in general and to commu-
nities across the country, and that is
the topic of healthcare.
I wanted to break this down a little
bit, in terms of where we are on this
issue for people who are watching, be-
cause this is one of the beauties of the
Special Order hour, that we get to talk
about the issues that matter; we get to
explain things; and we get to put for-
ward our proposals and our ideas.
I am so proud to say that, on Feb-
ruary 27, I and my colleague, Rep-
resentative DEBBIE DINGELL, intro-
duced the Medicare for All Act of 2019,
and we had 107 original cosponsors.
Those are the folks who sign on right
as it is getting introduced.
Of course, a bill gets introduced, and
we always add people on after that. But
this is 107 original cosponsors for this
act that would build upon, improve,
and expand Medicare so that it covers
every single person in this country—
universal healthcare, the idea that
healthcare is a right and not a privi-
lege.
Let me start by saying that we
Democrats are absolutely united
around the need to shore up the Afford-
able Care Act. There is no question
that there is work to do immediately
on some of the things that were done
to take away access to those with pre-
existing conditions, to strip away the
benefits of the Affordable Care Act. We
are 100 percent united around con-
tinuing to do that.
However, we have to have a bold vi-
sion that addresses the healthcare cri-
sis in this country that leaves 30 mil-
lion people uninsured and 40 million
people underinsured, without access to
healthcare.
We have to understand, in doing that,
in the United States today, we spend,
depending on what estimate you look
at, about $32 trillion to $39 trillion on
healthcare costs over 10 years. That is
going up to about $50 trillion over the
next 10 years on healthcare. That is
about 181⁄2 percent of GDP.
If you look at every other major in-
dustrialized country in the world, what
you see is that they provide
healthcare, comprehensive care, to ev-
erybody in their country, and they do
it at about half the cost, or less, of
what the United States spends.
You might think that you could look
at costs of healthcare in this country
and you could say: Well, America has
the best healthcare system in the
world, and that is why we spend so
much. We have the best healthcare out-
comes.
Well, let’s talk about that for a sec-
ond. In the United States, we spend 181⁄2
percent of our GDP on healthcare
costs, yet we have the worst health
outcomes of any peer country in the
world.
Today in the United States, we have
the highest maternal mortality rate.
We know what that is; that is moms
dying in childbirth.
We have the highest infant mortality
rate. That is kids dying at young ages.
We have the lowest life expectancy
rate of any of our peer countries. In
fact, we are the only industrialized
country in the world where life expect-
ancy is going down and not up.
So we don’t even have good health
outcomes to show for our healthcare
system.
That is why Representative DINGELL
and I and our 105 additional cosponsors
of the bill, and Representative TLAIB
and many others who are part of this
effort, have introduced the improved
Medicare for All Act of 2019.
What this bill does is it offers, first of
all, comprehensive coverage to every-
one in the country. We say that that
includes primary care; it includes vi-
sion, dental, hearing; it includes men-
tal health and substance abuse; it in-
cludes long-term services and supports,
maternal healthcare, and more.
Everybody in the country will have
access to healthcare when you get sick,
not when you need an emergency room,
not when you simply can’t take your
illness anymore, but when you actually
get sick.
This bill is the first time that we will
actually have long-term care supports
and services included in this coverage.
This is very, very important because it
covers seniors, obviously, our elderly,
as they get toward the end of their life,
and it includes people with disabilities
who have, traditionally, been left out
of this entire sphere.
What we do is we say that, instead of
the current system where you have to
get so poor that you have to be on Med-
icaid—you have to have a low level of
income, be on Medicaid—if you want
long-term supports and services, and
the automatic default is institutional
care instead of home care, we flip that
on its head and we say you get to stay
at home with the people you love. You
get to be in your home as you are deal-
ing with these incredible challenges
that you may have.
Our bill says no premiums, copays,
and deductibles. We don’t want you to
have to think about that as you go to
the doctor.
This is very important, because you
will hear this is a government takeover
of healthcare. That is what opponents
of my bill are already trying to tell
you.
I want you to hear this really clear-
ly, if you are listening: We use the
same network of doctors and hospitals
that is already here.
In fact, I bet, if we had a roomful
here and I were to ask people how
many of you have been told, or have a
family member or a relative who has
been told, that you can’t go to a cer-
tain hospital or doctor because it is out
of network, or you only get a certain
coverage if you go, I bet everybody
would raise their hands. I see people
raising their hands right now. Good for
you. I feel like I have an audience here.
What our plan says is that you can go
to any doctor or hospital. The govern-
ment isn’t taking over those services.
It is not going to be a different govern-
ment service. It is just the same as
what you have right now.
The only thing that changes is, in-
stead of having to argue with five in-
surance companies—because maybe
you have Medicare and you have Medi-
care Advantage; maybe you don’t have
anything at all; maybe you have a
combination of things put together. In-
stead of having to argue with five in-
surance companies, you get to just say:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2710 March 13, 2019
This is a government insurance pro-
gram. This is covered by one insurance
program, a single payer.
If you have heard that statement,
that is what that means. This is the
way that almost every industrialized
country in the world does it.
I think that we have to think about
what the problem is here, why have we
not been able to do this. We have, in-
creasingly, seen our healthcare system,
unfortunately, being moved more and
more to a for-profit system that puts
those profits over patients.
If you look at, for example, the cost
of pharmaceutical drugs in our country
today, it is so much more expensive to
get insulin treatment or cancer treat-
ments or even an MRI in the United
States. I have clients and constituents
who drive to Canada, who go to other
places, because they can’t afford the
drugs here, and they can buy the exact
same thing across the border for sig-
nificantly cheaper.
We are having a crisis, Madam
Speaker, where people are going to bed
at night thinking about how they are
going to pay their rent and pay for
their cancer treatment, how they are
going to afford to get the insulin treat-
ments that they want. People are fore-
closing on homes.
In fact, two-thirds of all the bank-
ruptcies today in the United States are
due to medical issues, medical costs.
GoFundMe has become one of the most
popular insurance plans around, where
people are just banking on the good-
ness of people to take care of their
healthcare costs. That is simply not
acceptable.
If we want to take on this question of
universal healthcare coverage, which,
by the way, Teddy Roosevelt talked
about in 1910, Harry Truman in 1945,
President Johnson—this is not a rad-
ical idea. It is actually something that
has been tried and tested.
But here in the United States, the
idea that we could provide universal
healthcare for everybody, make sure
that people get the healthcare access
that they need, this is the time for it.
Seventy percent of the American peo-
ple actually agree with us. You might
hear that that support goes down if you
say some other things, but let’s be
really clear that the fearmongering out
there is driven by for-profit industries
that, unfortunately, have a lot to lose
if a plan like this were to pass, because
we would actually make sure that we
are not only providing universal cov-
erage but that we also have cost con-
tainment built into our system.
That is what my bill does. We build
in cost containment measures so that
we can actually bring down the overall
cost of healthcare in this country to
what is standard in other countries
around the world.
This is incredibly important to us,
and as we think about who gains and
who loses in this, I believe that it is ac-
tually a win-win for everybody who is
concerned about putting patients over
profits.
It is a win-win for doctors who have
been trained to take care of patients
but, instead, spend 25 to 30 percent of
their time dealing with insurance com-
panies and trying to do all the paper-
work that needs to be there, trying to
argue for a patient of theirs to be able
to get the care they need.
It is a win for hospitals that want to
make sure that they know what kind
of budgets they are going to have and
that they can work within that. We
have something built into our plan
called global budgeting, which is actu-
ally the standard in other countries
but is being tested in Maryland to
great effect, where hospitals get an
overall amount of money, and they get
a global budget. We have that built in
as well.
It is a win for patients. This is the
thing that is so important to empha-
size again and again.
Actually, before I get to the patients,
let me say it is also a win for our busi-
nesses, particularly our small- and me-
dium-sized businesses. I have a lot of
business owners who might disagree
with me on a few other issues, many of
them are across the aisle—they are Re-
publicans; they are independents. They
come up to me and they say: Rep-
resentative, I don’t agree with you on
this or this or this, but please, can you
get the Medicare for All bill passed, be-
cause we cannot, as small businesses
and even medium-sized businesses and,
by the way, even large-sized businesses,
deal with the growing cost of these in-
surance premiums that we are paying
that are really just going to line the
pockets of top CEOs.
The CEO of UnitedHealth took home
$82 million, even as people are not able
to afford treatments and are dying.
The other CEOs have taken in $52 mil-
lion, $29 million.
We have to make sure that the bal-
ance of something like healthcare,
which is an essential, I believe, a com-
mon good in this country, that we are
able to provide that to people.
There are lots of other places where
markets can work, but in this market-
place where you need to make sure
that healthcare is provided to every-
body regardless of whether you are rich
or poor, regardless of where you live,
regardless of the color of your skin,
this is where the government comes in
to try to help make sure that that is
actually possible.
This is a really important bill for us,
and I am absolutely honored to have so
many of my colleagues who are so
smart on these issues, not only in lib-
eral districts like mine but also in
frontline districts, places that were
held by Republicans for a very long
time.
My Democratic colleagues flipped
those districts, and they ran on this
issue. They ran on this issue, and they
won on this issue, because they know,
and their constituents know, that it is
time to take profit out of this system
and make sure that it once again gets
focused on the healthcare of people.
We also have an incredible coalition
of labor unions that have come on
board for the first time ever. Our
teachers are on board, our machinists,
our steelworkers. We have so many dif-
ferent unions that are on board this
time.
Our disability rights community is
on board.
Our women’s organizations are on
board, because for the first time, we
make sure that everybody gets the care
they need, whether they are a woman
or a man, and we make sure that peo-
ple have control over their reproduc-
tive choices.
We are absolutely thrilled about this.
I want to be clear about one thing, as
I turn this back over to my incredible
colleague from Michigan. This is not a
messaging bill. I want to be clear about
that.
For the first time in the House of
Representatives, this bill is over 120
pages long. It is a detailed analysis and
layout of exactly how this would work.
It ensures that everybody gets
healthcare. It keeps the existing sys-
tem of delivery that we have. We are
not changing the system of delivery.
It does not in any way say that insur-
ance companies can’t continue to oper-
ate. They just can’t provide the same
benefits that we are providing through
the government insurance plan. That is
actually the way Medicare works right
now.
b 1515
You can’t provide the same benefits
because we don’t want a two-tiered sys-
tem.
Now, if they want to provide benefits
outside of what we provide, they are
welcome to do so. That is how Medi-
care Advantage originally came in to
being. Medicare Advantage plans, the
benefits that are offered under those,
would be included in our plan, so we
wouldn’t need those plans. But insur-
ance companies are free to continue to
innovate as they need to; and we have
built in 1 percent of the cost of the bill
for the first 5 years actually goes to a
fund that ensures transition and appro-
priate support for workers in the insur-
ance industries who may actually end
up having to lose their jobs or to even-
tually transition into this new system
that we have.
We will, for the first time, thanks to
Speaker PELOSI’s support, and others’
support, we will have hearings on this
bill. And whether you agree or you dis-
agree with the premise, what I would
ask is that you understand how critical
it is to address and finally get to uni-
versal healthcare in this country.
This is a debate that should have
been had on the House floor and in our
committees a long time ago. We are fi-
nally going to have that with a number
of different committees; and I am look-
ing forward to continuing to help lead
with all of my colleagues on ensuring
that healthcare is a right and not a
privilege; that you don’t have to be
wealthy to get basic healthcare; and

that we improve the ultimate competi-
tiveness of our businesses, our families,
our communities, and the health, the
basic health, the right to live with dig-
nity and respect for all of our people.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, that
was incredible. And obviously, many of
us in the Congressional Progressive
Caucus have fully supported so much of
what Medicare for All stands for. I
thank the gentlewoman from Wash-
ington for her leadership and courage
for taking on such a bold move.
Madam Speaker, I am very honored
to be here representing the community
that raised me. I was raised in South-
west Detroit, in the 13th Congressional
District. Growing up in Southwest De-
troit, I actually thought that smell
was normal, all the pollution that I
kind of grew up in, all the truck traf-
fic. As I got older, I realized it wasn’t
normal. It wasn’t normal that so many
of my neighbors were getting cancer or
had respiratory issues. It wasn’t nor-
mal that one of five children have asth-
ma.
We have one of the highest—one of
the worst air qualities in the State of
Michigan in the 13th Congressional
District; and it is the third poorest
Congressional District in the country.
So the deadly consequences of being
uninsured is real for my constituents
at home; through no fault of their own,
but for the fact that they live in com-
munities that are polluted and commu-
nities that lack so much opportunity
to be able to thrive.
So this is an important issue, not
only to millions of Americans today,
but to my residents; this need for uni-
versal healthcare. It is a topic that
most, if not all of us in this Chamber
were sent here to work on. It is a topic
that is always on the minds of our resi-
dents every single day. It is a topic
that is literally a life or death situa-
tion, and an issue that has bankrupted
many of our families; an issue that we
should not be worried about in this
country.
We are the richest country on the
planet, but the United States is the
only industrialized country without
universal healthcare.
Fifty thousand residents in my dis-
trict are uninsured. This is why I am
thrilled and excited that over 100 of my
colleagues have signed on to sponsor
the Medicare for All Act.
More than 30 million Americans are
without access to healthcare right now
without insurance, with an additional
40 million who cannot afford co-pays
and the deductible.
Pharmaceutical companies make bil-
lions, Madam Speaker, in profits, while
working Americans are forced to go
through extraordinary measures to pay
for care.
Just the other day, I heard a mother
talk about losing her 6-year-old child,
her little girl, because she couldn’t af-
ford insulin. This is why we need some-
thing bold, courageous, trans-
formational, and that is supporting
Medicare for All.
We spend the highest amount per
capita in the world on healthcare. We
need a better system for our constitu-
ents. We need Medicare for All.
This system is one that many more
of my colleagues should get behind. It
provides a system where our constitu-
ents will know that they are secure
and getting healthcare that they need
today. This is a system that will take
away the worry of our constituents
who have constant, day-in, day-out
thinking about the cost of healthcare,
and whether or not their current insur-
ance even covers it.
It is really important to be clear
about Medicare for All. One, it includes
comprehensive coverage for primary
care, for hospital, outpatient services,
prescription drugs, reproductive health
services, newborn care, long-term care
services. This is so critical for my resi-
dents.
Constantly do I hear, day-in, day-out
of families that are taking care of their
parents and not having access to long-
term care coverage.
It supports mental health and sub-
stance abuse treatment, laboratory and
diagnostic services, and so much more.
Patients will have complete freedom
to choose their doctors. I am going to
say this again. Patients will have com-
plete freedom, under the Medicare for
All Act, to choose their doctors, hos-
pitals, and other providers that they
wish to see.
Long-term care, again, in support for
our older Americans, our neighbors,
and those with disabilities, will be cov-
ered.
Medicare for All will decrease the
costs by reducing inefficiency; pre-
venting healthcare corporations from
overcharging; and increasing trans-
parency in our system.
Medicare for All will also decrease
prescription drug costs by allowing
Medicare to finally negotiate our
prices.
The legislation also preserves
healthcare programs for our veterans
and our Native Americans.
Healthcare is a right, Madam Speak-
er, not a privilege for the wealthy.
And not only is this the most incred-
ible class, and not because I am part of
it, but it really is, it is the largest in-
coming class since Watergate but,
more importantly, it is the most di-
verse.
We not only ran because we wanted
to be first, or we wanted to be diverse,
we ran because we speak differently;
we serve differently; and we are much
more courageous than, I think, pre-
vious classes ever have been.
So, I am asking our colleagues to
please stand up and support Medicare
for All. Give it a chance. See the possi-
bility of finally being able to provide
for our constituents’ universal
healthcare.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
f
AND STILL I RISE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for the re-
mainder of the hour as the designee of
the majority leader.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise because I love my
country. And I rise tonight on the Re-
publican side of what we call the aisle.
I do so, Madam Speaker, because the
issue that I will call to the attention of
this august body is not an issue that I
consider a Republican issue. I don’t
consider it a Democratic issue. I con-
sider this an issue for the American
people, past, present, and the future.
This is an issue that has plagued our
country almost since its inception. It
is an issue that we have avoided with
intentionality, avoided because of dis-
comfort, avoided through the years.
But it is an issue that we have to ad-
dress.
So I rise tonight, Madam Speaker,
with love of country at heart on the
Republican side of the aisle. And I rise
to announce, as I have before, that we
have to take up the question of im-
peachment.
I rise, Madam Speaker, to say this
and to give some explanations. There
are many things that are being mis-
understood. I trust that I can bring
some degree of clarity to the issues
that are misunderstood.
And I know, Madam Speaker, as I
rise, and understand that this will
come to a vote in this House; I know
that it will be a tough vote for many
people. I understand. It will be a tough
vote for a multiplicity of reasons. It
will be a tough vote.
I know what tough votes are like, so
I understand. I have people in my com-
munity, one example, members of the
clergy that I have had to explain some
very tough votes to. I have some that
have, to this day, not agreed with the
tough votes that I have had to take.
Tough votes. I came here to take
tough votes. I came here to deal with
tough issues, the difficult. I came to do
what I believe should have been done
long before now; but the opportunity to
do it has presented itself since I arrived
in Congress, so I take on this chal-
lenge. And I understand that this will
be a tough vote.
Before I get to some of the nuances of
the explanation that I would like to
give, let me just tell you who I will be
voting for when I take this tough vote.
I will be voting for the slave mother
who had a baby ripped out of her arms,
taken to the auction block.
This is why I can relate to those
mothers on the border who had their
babies ripped out of their arms; and
still, many have not been returned to
their mothers, their fathers. I can re-
late because I understand the histor-
ical context. I will be voting for them.
Tough vote, but I will be voting for
the slave father who never got to see
his child because the mother and the
child were taken away, auctioned off,
sent to some distant plantation; never
allowed the opportunity to enjoy the
love that a father ought to with a

child. That is the historical context of
why I will be voting and what I will be
voting for.
I will also be voting for the elderly
mother who was of African ancestry,
who had to say ‘‘yes, ma’am’’ and ‘‘yes,
sir’’ to the 3-year-old children of the
master. At that time it would have
been called the boss, but it was the
master; had to say ‘‘yes, ma’am’’ and
‘‘yes, sir’’ to the children.
To the father, I will vote for the fa-
ther who was called ‘‘boy,’’ demeaned
in the presence of his son. I know. I saw
that happen to my father. I know about
that elderly mother. I saw it happen to
her, the elderly black mother. I will be
voting for them. They have come
through the years to get me here. I
won’t forget them.
I will be voting for the LGBTQ per-
son who was fired for showing up at
work and saying I married the love of
my life, who happens to be the same
sex as that person was. I am an ally of
the LGBTQ community.
I am going to vote for those persons
who have been discriminated against.
b 1530
I will be voting for those who lost
their lives in the Tree of Life syna-
gogue, lost their lives to bigotry, hate.
I will be voting for those who lost
their lives at the church in Charlotte.
I will be voting for the woman, who
was a peaceful protestor, who lost her
life in Charlottesville among the big-
ots, the KKK, the neo-Nazis, the
xenophobes, the homophobes. I will be
voting for her.
And here is why I will be voting for
all of them: because these Articles of
Impeachment will be about bigotry
emanating from the Presidency—in
policy, I might add, bigotry in policy.
There is clear and convincing evidence
that we have bigotry in policy. I will be
voting for the people who are the vic-
tims.
To those who would tell me this is
not something that the Congress ought
to entertain, here is what I would say.
I would say, if the Congress of the
United States of America could, in
1868, impeach President Andrew John-
son for speaking ill of Congress, this
Congress can impeach for bigotry in
policy.
It is just a question of whether 218
people, assuming all are present, will
vote for it. That is what it is. It is just
a question of whether we have the will
to do it. The way is before us.
Article II, Section 4, all of the noted
constitutional scholars—maybe there
is some exception; there probably is
one someplace—have concluded that
Article II, Section 4 not only allows a
President to be impeached for crimi-
nality, a President can also be im-
peached for misdeeds.
As a matter of fact, those who desire
to edify themselves can read Federalist
65, read the words of Hamilton and
Madison and Jay. Read their words.
Let them communicate with you
through the vista of time.
You will find, when you read their
writings, that they were prophetic in
their thoughts, that they understood
that there would be a time such as
this, and they have given us the recipe
for this time and the means by which
we can take corrective action.
When you read, you will find that,
without question, they indicate that
impeachment is not something that
will be done without some degree of
turmoil, that impeachment will be
something that will sometimes be
along party lines. Party lines occur
when impeachment is brought before
this august body.
By the way, I brought impeachment
twice before, so I am talking about
something that has occurred and some-
thing that will occur again.
So impeachment is something that
was anticipated. It is something that is
a remedy that is constitutional, and I
plan to bring that remedy before this
body so that we may take a stand.
Dr. King was a great man and some-
body I admire, and I talk about him
quite regularly. Dr. King reminded us
that the truest measure of the person
is not where you stand in times of com-
fort and convenience, but where you
stand in times of challenge and con-
troversy. When you have hard votes to
take, where do you stand?
I don’t believe bigotry should be a
talking point, something that we use
to get the base out at election time. We
go out and we talk about, oh, how bad
certain people are and we announce
that they are racist, that they are big-
ots. I don’t think it ought to be a talk-
ing point. I think it should be an ac-
tion item.
I am bringing the vote because it is
going to be an action item for Congress
at last. Again, it will be an action
item, not just a talking point. I am
going to put the moral imperative to
vote for all of these people that I called
to your attention and countless others
above political expediency.
Political expediency allows us to
push this issue to the next generation.
Political expediency has allowed us to
reach this point in our history where
bigotry is rearing its ugly head. It is no
longer covert, but it is now overt. We
have reached this point in our history.
So I refuse to except political expedi-
ency as a remedy.
Why not wait? Let’s defeat at the
polls as opposed to impeach here in the
House.
I don’t buy into that.
Now, there are many who would say
let’s wait on the Mueller report. The
Mueller report has nothing to do with
bigotry. It most likely has to do with
criminality associated with obstruc-
tion of justice, probably has something
to do with emoluments, could have
something to do with collusion, which
is a layperson’s way of saying con-
spiracy. It could have something to do
with all of these.
But I assure each and every person
who is within the sound of my voice by
whatever means, it will have nothing
to do with bigotry. So there is no need
to wait for the Mueller report because
the Mueller report won’t address big-
otry. Those who would rather impeach
for some other thing, then wait for the
Mueller report.
By the way, I don’t plan to get in the
way of the Mueller report, but I will
say this: The Framers of the Constitu-
tion never intended for the executive
branch to investigate itself, and that is
what is going on.
The Framers of the Constitution un-
derstood the implications of having the
executive branch investigate itself.
One such implication that we see now
is that the Mueller report may not be
presented to Congress. It is going to
the President before it gets to Con-
gress.
The Framers never intended for the
executive to investigate itself. That is
the responsibility of Congress. That is
why I brought Articles of Impeach-
ment.
Pardon me for using a personal pro-
noun. My mother taught me better.
That is why I brought Articles of Im-
peachment in a previous Congress when
we had Republicans in charge.
I am not going to be hypocritical and
conclude now that Democrats are in
charge, we don’t have the same duty,
responsibility, and obligation. I am not
that kind of guy. We are going to go on
record. It will be a hard vote, but we
are going to go on record.
Some would say: Well, how do you
get the proof of the bigotry?
Easy answer—it appears to be a
tough question. Easy answer: the same
way we got the proof that we brought
to the floor of the House for colleagues
who had resolutions that were to con-
demn for bigoted statements. Same
way, we get them from news sources.
We have plenty of empirical evidence
to show us by clear and convincing evi-
dence as a standard, or whatever stand-
ard the House uses, because there is no
standard codified in the law for the
House. But by whatever standard the
House should use, there is plenty of
empirical evidence to support bigotry
in policy emanating from the Presi-
dency, plenty of them: S- - - -hole coun-
tries; and then you go out, by the way,
where people of color happen to reside,
I might add, and you go out and de-
velop an immigration policy that ad-
versely impacts those people of color,
changing the law to adversely impact
them.
Bigotry in policy? Ha. I talked about
the babies at the border—people of
color, I might add—separating them.
We didn’t do that at Ellis Island. We
didn’t do that when 12 million people
came from Europe, Scandinavia. We
didn’t do that. We didn’t separate them
from their children. We didn’t have a
flotilla out there to stop them. We
didn’t try to build walls to keep them
out. They came.
The people who are at the border, by
the way, are exercising their rights
under the law that we promulgated,
that we, the United States of America,

put in place that says that they can
come up and ask for asylum.
By the way, I do not contend that all
who seek asylum should be granted
asylum. I do think that the process,
the law that we put in place, ought to
be honored. And if we don’t like the
law, then we should change the law.
There is plenty of opportunity to do so.
There has been plenty of opportunity
to do so. Change the law if you don’t
like the way we have decided to deal
with these issues.
There is plenty of evidence that in
the past we have accommodated per-
sons who were trying to flee harm’s
way, bringing their children with
them. When those persons were fleeing
Castro’s Cuba and traversed the shark-
infested waters of the Gulf of Mexico—
I say ‘‘shark-invested’’ because there
are so many people who are saying:
Well, we don’t want them to do this be-
cause they can be harmed along the
way.
We didn’t say that about the people
who were traversing the shark-infested
waters of the Gulf of Mexico. We cre-
ated a policy called wet foot, dry foot.
One foot on dry land, and you had a
pathway to citizenship. That was the
policy of the United States of America,
to accommodate.
I am not saying bring the world in. I
am saying follow the law. It seems to
me that is what we are all about. I be-
lieve in the law of the land that I live
in and that I love. And I love my coun-
try.
So I want to assure persons that we
will use the same standard of proof
that we have been using on previous
occasions.
Now, the next question: Impeach-
ment is like voting to go to war. Cast-
ing a vote to impeach is comparable to
casting a vote to go to war.
I visit the VA hospital annually,
Madam Speaker, and I take flags to
every veteran in that hospital. This
year, we took 600 flags, and we needed
more.
I would ask persons who believe that
this is comparable to casting a vote to
go to war, go to the place where you
can see the price of freedom. Go to the
place where you can see what the cost
is, where you will see that it is not in
silver and gold. Go to a VA hospital, a
VA hospital where you will see persons
who have lost an arm, lost a leg, no
longer have vision. Many of them leave
and don’t return the way they left.
Just go and see what the price of free-
dom is like.
They fight for our freedom. They are
willing to give their lives for our free-
dom. That is what a vote for war is all
about. Many don’t ever return. They
are the liberators. They accord us our
freedom by putting their lives on the
line, and it is that freedom that we
have that allows us to vote to impeach.
Voting for impeachment is not a vote
to go to war. You ask somebody who
has lost a leg in those hospitals, talk
to them. Oh, you may find one person
whom you can use and try to equate
that to the rest of the world, but I as-
sure you, those veterans don’t consider
impeachment comparable to voting to
go to war.
I would also add this: There are those
who believe that bigotry is something
that the Senate won’t take up.
If we use that line of logic, I
shouldn’t have gone to law school for
fear of failure.
If we use that line of logic, we
shouldn’t have sent H.R. 1 over to the
Senate, because it has been prognos-
ticated that the Senate won’t take it
up in any meaningful way.
b 1545
If we use that line of logic, there are
bills that we send to the Senate quite
regularly that we would not send be-
cause of a belief that the Senate won’t
take up these bills. So I don’t buy into
that logic. But I do believe that we
should give the Senate an opportunity
to do its job. It ought to have that op-
portunity.
Remember now, this is not about
Mueller, this is about bigotry ema-
nating from the Presidency. This is
about having the country, by and
through its representatives, go on
record in terms of where we stand in
this time of challenge and controversy
as it relates to bigotry emanating from
the Presidency.
Impeachment is something that we
all should respect because it is con-
stitutional. It is what the Constitution
permits. It is also what I believe I have
a duty to bring before the Congress. I
will do so.
I don’t guarantee more than one
vote, and that is my vote. There are
people who seem to think that if they
can convince me, that the people who
voted for it previously won’t be voting
for it this time. That the people who
voted for it previously, they have
changed their minds, they are going to
be against you. They are not against
me. I am not against them. I say to
them, vote your conscience. Stand
where your convictions are now.
But there are people who seem to
think that by convincing me that I will
be alone, that somehow this will cause
me not to act. My dear brothers and
sisters, how you have underestimated
me. My dear brothers and sisters, I
didn’t come here to go along so that I
could get along and move along. My
dear brothers and sisters, you have
grossly underestimated me.
If I stand alone and there is but one
vote cast, I assure you that one vote
will be cast and I will stand alone. I un-
derstand that in the eons to come, peo-
ple will look back on this time and
they will query what was wrong with
them. What was wrong with them? How
could they tolerate an unfit person
holding the highest office in the land?
How could they tolerate it? They will
want to know what was wrong with
them.
But I also know this. They will see
that there was at least one person who
stood on the ground of righteousness,
who put the moral imperative above
political expediency.
And I will know also that the world
will know where this country stands on
the issue of bigotry. I didn’t come here
to manage bigotry. That is what we do.
We always want to get back to bigotry
as usual after it rears its ugly head.
Let’s put that head down and get back
to bigotry as usual. Let it be covert,
but not overt.
My guess is some people have said to
the President: Mr. President, you can
do all of these things without dis-
playing your bigotry. They didn’t say
it that way, but they probably tried to
convince him. You don’t have to be
raw. Do it the way others have done it
and you will be appreciated.
I don’t want to get back to bigotry as
usual. I think we send a message to the
world when we impeach a President for
bigotry and policy, and that is what I
am talking about: bigotry and policy.
Not just his words—I don’t think that
we ought to have a bigot in office, but
not just his words—but for what his
words have been transformed into,
what they have metamorphosed into:
bigotry and policy.
I think that we would send a positive
message to the world in terms of where
we stand, and we would also send a
message to many of the people in this
country as to how much we care about
them, those who suffer from bigotry on
a daily basis. If you take out the head
bigot, you will send a message to the
bigots along the way at the lower end
of the ladder.
Now, about the people who are suf-
fering; they have elected us time and
time again, many of them, on the belief
that this time they are going to take
up racism. This time they are going to
take up homophobia, xenophobia,
Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and na-
tivism. This time they are going to
take up the issues that impact my life
on a daily basis. Yes, it is still here.
The glass ceiling exists because of big-
otry. There is a glass ceiling. Yes, it is
still here.
There are people who have jobs of
color and they have to train persons of
a different hue to take the job that
they have and become their supervisor.
It still happens. It is still occurring in
the United States of America. The
country I love, by the way.
You can love your country and want
to see it improve. That is what all of
these bills are about here. Everybody
that is filing a bill wants to improve
the country. That is all I want to do,
too. The unfortunate circumstance for
a good many people is I want to deal
with an issue that we have, for too
long, placed on the back burner of our
contemporary agenda. I am going to
place it on the front burner. There will
be a vote.
How do you know there will be a
vote? Well, the rules allow it. The rules
allow any Member of this august body
to come forward with a privileged reso-
lution.
Now, if you want to change the rules,
you can do so. Republicans didn’t do it

when they were in control of the
House. But you can do it. Let’s let his-
tory show that because one Democrat
wanted to bring articles of impeach-
ment, that a Democratic Party did
what a Republican Party did not do.
Let history reflect that. Change the
rules. You have to live with the his-
tory. I don’t. I am going to be on the
right side of the history.
Now, someone would say: But, Al,
you will be on the wrong side of poli-
tics. Do you know what? The people
that I know suffered, the people who
lived and died so that I could have this
opportunity, the people who found out
what a billy club hits like, found out
what a 90-pound German Shepherd
bites like, found out what a high pres-
sure water hose stings like, the people
who lost loved ones to a cause so that
I could have this opportunity, I don’t
know that they want me to be on the
right side of politics. I think they want
me to be on the right side of history.
But I also believe that they want me to
be on the right side of this moral issue
of our time, and that is whether we
will tolerate bigotry emanating from
the Presidency.
So to everyone, understand this is
not going to be about obstruction of
justice. I came to the floor and called
that to the attention of the country.
There is evidence to move forward on
obstruction of justice, but I choose not
to do so. It is not going to be about
conspiracy. There is evidence, but I
choose not to do so.
This is going to be about bigotry, and
it is going to be about where do you
stand? The truest measure of the per-
son is not where you stand in times of
comfort and convenience, but where do
you stand in times of challenge and
controversy? Where do you stand when
bigotry is the issue that you have to
vote on?
And to all of my colleagues, I want
you to know I love you. It doesn’t mat-
ter what side of the aisle you are on. I
respect you. And I only say to you,
vote your conscience. Decide what side
of bigotry, what side of history, what
side of righteousness you are going to
be on.
I know where I will stand. I will hold
my head up high, notwithstanding all
of the slings and arrows that are going
to come against me. They are coming.
They are going to demean me in every
way. My mother probably wouldn’t
know who I am when they are done
with me. I understand it.
Gandhi gave us the formula. First
they ignore you. These are the words of
Gandhi. Then they laugh at you. Then
after they have ignored you and they
have had a moment of laughter and
they see that you are not going away,
then they fight you. Then they demean
you. I understand.
So do what you may. Say what you
may. But I know, within me, that I am
doing the right thing.
I know that Gandhi is right. He said
that after they have ignored you, after
they have laughed and had their mo-
ment of pleasure about it, then they
fight you, but then, Gandhi reminded
us, then you win.
I am prepared to suffer through until
victory. I won’t give out. To quote my
good friend, Mr. LEWIS, who crossed the
Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sun-
day, ‘‘I won’t give up. I won’t give in.’’
I will do that which my ancestors call
upon me to do. I pray to God that this
House will vote its conscience. Vote
your convictions.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
O God, our righteous judge, the up-
right will behold your face. Lord, we
thank You for Your power that keeps
us from stumbling on life’s road.
Today, give our Senators the wisdom
to find in You their refuge and
strength. As they face complex chal-
lenges, may they flee to You for guid-
ance and fellowship. Lord, as they
make You the foundation of their hope
and joy, empower them to run life’s
race without weariness, knowing that
Your bountiful harvest of goodness is
certain.
We pray in Your merciful Name.
Amen.

EXECUTIVE SESSION
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report.
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Neomi J. Rao, of the District
of Columbia, to be United States Cir-
cuit Judge for the District of Columbia
Circuit.
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
yesterday the Senate confirmed a well-
qualified jurist chosen by President
Trump to serve on the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals. Paul Matey of New
Jersey will bring a wealth of experi-
ence to the bench, and I was proud to
support his nomination.
We also voted to advance the nomi-
nation of Neomi Rao to the DC Circuit.
This nominee is yet another of the
President’s excellent choices to serve
as a Federal judge.
Ms. Rao graduated with honors from
Yale and the University of Chicago
School of Law. Her record includes a
distinguished tenure in academia, pub-
lic and private sector legal experience,
as well as a clerkship on the U.S. Su-
preme Court.
Most importantly, in testimony be-
fore our colleagues on the Judiciary
Committee, she demonstrated a com-
mitment to maintaining the public
trust and upholding the rule of law. So
the committee favorably reported Ms.
Rao’s nomination, and soon the Senate
will have an opportunity to continue
fulfilling our advice and consent re-
sponsibilities by voting to confirm her
to the Federal bench.
We will also vote this afternoon on
the nomination of William Beach, who
has been waiting for over a year to
take his post as Commissioner of Labor
Statistics. Our colleagues on the HELP
Committee recommended Mr. Beach to
the floor in December of 2017. A full
year later, with no progress, he was re-
turned to the White House. Now he is
finally getting a floor vote. This point-
less obstruction needs to change, but I
am glad we can at least confirm Mr.
Beach this week.
YEMEN
Madam President, now, on another
matter, the Senate will soon vote on a
resolution under the War Powers Act. I
strongly oppose this unnecessary and
counterproductive resolution and urge
our colleagues to join me in opposing
it.
From the outset, let me say this. I
believe it is right for Senators to have
grave concerns over some aspects of
Saudi Arabia’s behavior, particularly
the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That
is not what this resolution is about,
however. In December, the Senate
voted on a resolution that addressed
this institution’s concerns about Saudi
Arabia.
If Senators continue to have con-
cerns about Saudi behavior, they
should raise them in hearings and di-
rectly with the administration and di-
rectly with Saudi officials, as I have
done, and they should allow a vote on
the confirmation of retired GEN John
Abizaid, whose nomination to be U.S.
Ambassador to Riyadh is being held up
once again by Democratic obstruction.
They should also allow a vote on the
nomination of David Schenker to be
Assistant Secretary of State for Near
Eastern Affairs. He has been held up
here for nearly a year. If we want to
solve problems in the Middle East
through diplomacy, we will need to
confirm diplomats.
Regarding Yemen, it is completely
understandable that Senators have
concerns over the war, the American
interests entangled in it, and its con-
sequences for Yemeni civilians. I think
there is bipartisan agreement, shared
by the administration, that our objec-
tive should be to end this horrible con-
flict, but this resolution doesn’t end
the conflict. It will not help Saudi pi-
lots avoid civilian casualties. It will

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1808 March 13, 2019
not enhance America’s diplomatic le-
verage. In fact, it will make it harder
to achieve those very objectives.
This is an inappropriate and counter-
productive measure. First, the admin-
istration has already ended—ended—
air-to-air refueling of coalition air-
craft. We only provide limited noncom-
bat support to the U.N.-recognized
Yemeni Government and to the Saudi-
led coalition. It certainly does not—
does not—constitute hostilities.
Second, there are real threats from
the Houthis in Yemen whom Iran, as
we all know, is backing. Missiles and
explosives are being aimed at civilians,
anti-ship missiles are being fired at
vessels in key shipping lanes of global
importance.
If one of those missiles kills a large
number of Saudi or Emirati civilians,
let alone Americans who live in Riyadh
or Dubai, say goodbye to any hope of a
negotiated end to this conflict. These
threats will not evaporate. They are
not going to go away if the United
States ends its limited support. So I
think of the American citizens who live
in the regions.
Third, our focus should be on ending
the war in Yemen responsibly. Pulling
the plug on support to our partners
only undermines the very leverage and
influence we need to help facilitate the
U.N.’s diplomatic efforts. The United
States will be in a better position to
encourage the Saudi-led coalition to
take diplomatic risks if our partners
trust that we appreciate the signifi-
cant, legitimate threats they face from
the Houthis.
Fourth, we face real threats from al-
Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. We
need cooperation from Yemen, the
UAE, and Saudi Arabia to defeat those
terrorists. So we should think twice
about undermining these very partners
whose cooperation we obviously need
for our own security.
Here is my bottom line. We should
not use this specific vote on a specific
policy decision as some proxy for all
the Senate’s broad feelings about for-
eign affairs. Concerns about Saudi
human rights issues should be directly
addressed with the administration and
with the Saudi officials. That is what I
have chosen to do. That is what I rec-
ommend others do.
As for Yemen, we need to ask what
action will actually serve our goal;
that is, working with partners to en-
courage a negotiated solution.
Withdrawing? Would withdrawing
our support facilitate efforts to end the
war, or just embolden the Houthis?
Would sending this signal enhance or
weaken our leverage over the Saudi-led
coalition? Would voting for this resolu-
tion strengthen the hand of the U.N.
Special Envoy, Martin Griffiths, or in
fact undermine his work? Would we
prefer that Saudi Arabia and the UAE
go to China and Russia for assistance
instead of the United States?
The answers to these questions is
pretty clear. We need to vote no on this
misguided resolution.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Madam President, now one final mat-
ter. Yesterday, I continued the discus-
sion we have been having about the
strange ideas that seem to have taken
ahold of Washington Democrats.
Ideas like the Democrat politician
protection act, a scheme to limit
America’s First Amendment right to
political speech and force taxpayers to
subsidize political campaigns, includ-
ing ones they disagree with. It did not
earn a single Republican vote in the
House, by the way. Thank goodness.
Ideas like Medicare for None, which
could spend more than $32 trillion to
hollow out seniors’ health benefits and
boot working families from their cho-
sen plans into a one-size-fits-all gov-
ernment scheme.
Even the soaring costs and massive
disruption that plan would cause
American families are dwarfed—
dwarfed—by the grandiose scheme they
are marketing as the Green New Deal.
By now, we are all familiar with the
major thrust of the proposal: powering
down the U.S. economy, and yet some-
how also creating government-directed
economic security for everyone—for
everyone—at the same time.
Naturally, accomplishing all this is
quite a tall order. According to the
Democrats’ resolution, it will require
overhauling every building in America
to meet strict new codes, overseen, of
course, by social planners here in
Washington. It would require banning
the production of American coal, oil,
and natural gas in 10 short years and
cracking down on transportation sys-
tems that produce any emissions,
which, as one hastily deleted back-
ground document made clear, is just a
polite way of saying Democrats want
to eventually ban anything with a
motor that runs on gasoline. They
want to ban anything with a motor
that runs on gasoline.
I thought ‘‘Abolish ICE’’ was bad
enough when Democrats were rallying
to close down all of Immigration and
Customs Enforcement, but now what
do we get? The far left also wants to
abolish the internal combustion en-
gine. I gather somewhere around that
time is when the miraculous, promised
universal job guarantee would kick in
as well. It is just a good, old-fashioned,
state-planned economy—garden-vari-
ety 21st-century socialism.
Our Democratic colleagues have
taken all the debunked philosophies of
the last 100 years, rolled them into one
giant package, and thrown a little
‘‘green’’ paint on them to make them
look new, but there is nothing re-
motely new about a proposal to cen-
tralize control over the economy and
raise taxes on the American people to
pay for it.
Margaret Thatcher famously said
that the trouble with socialist govern-
ments is ‘‘they always run out of other
people’s money.’’ How often have we
heard that? Well, this dangerous fan-
tasy would burn through the American
people’s money before it even got off
the launchpad.
The cost to the Treasury is just the
beginning. It is hard to put a price tag
on ripping away the jobs and liveli-
hoods of literally millions of Ameri-
cans. It is hard to put a price tag on
forcibly remodeling Americans’ homes
whether they want it or not and taking
away their cars whether they want
that or not. It certainly is difficult to
put a price tag on unilaterally dis-
arming the entire U.S. economy with
this kind of self-inflicted wound while
other nations, such as China, go roar-
ing by—roaring by.
By definition, global emissions are a
global problem. Even if we grant the
Democrats’ unproven claim that
cratering American industries and out-
lawing the energy sources that middle-
class families can afford would produce
the kinds of emissions changes they
are after, we need to remember that
the United States is only responsible
for about 15 percent of the world’s
greenhouse gas emissions—only 15 per-
cent of the global total.
According to the Department of En-
ergy, the United States cut our own en-
ergy-related carbon emissions by 14
percent from 2005 to 2017. So we cut
carbon emissions in this country sig-
nificantly from 2005 to 2017. Well, it is
appropriate to ask, what did the rest of
the world do? They kept soaring higher
and higher.
In the same period that the United
States cut our energy-related carbon
emissions by 14 percent, the Inter-
national Energy Agency found that
worldwide, energy-related carbon emis-
sions rose by 20 percent everywhere
else. China—the world’s largest carbon
emitter—increased its emissions dra-
matically over that period. So, believe
me, if Democrats succeeded at slowing
the U.S. economy and cutting our pros-
perity because they think it will save
the planet, China will not pull over by
the side of the road to keep us com-
pany; they will go roaring right by us.
The proposal we are talking about is,
frankly, delusional—absolutely delu-
sional. It is so unserious that it ought
to be beneath one of our two major po-
litical parties to line up behind it.
The Washington Post editorial
board—not exactly a bastion of con-
servatism—dismissed the notion that
‘‘the country could reach net-zero
greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030’’ as
‘‘an impossible goal.’’
In a clear sign of how rapidly Demo-
crats are racing to the far left, Presi-
dent Obama’s own Energy Secretary
said the same thing. He said: ‘‘I just
cannot see how we could possibly go to
zero carbon in the 10-year timeframe.’’
These Washington Democrats’
leftward sprint is leaving Obama ad-
ministration officials in the dust and
even parts of their own base. Listen to
what Democrats’ usual Big Labor allies
have to say about this socialist night-
mare. Union leaders with the AFL–CIO
say this proposal ‘‘could cause imme-
diate harm to millions of our members
and their families.’’ That is what the
AFL–CIO union leaders said. Imme-
diate harm to American workers,

American farmers, American families,

near enough reduction in global emis-
sions to show for it. It is a self-inflicted
wound for the low price, by one esti-
mate, of somewhere in the neighbor-

This is not based on logic or reason;
it is just based on the prevailing fash-

ORDER OF BUSINESS
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent that following the disposition
of the Beach nomination, the Senate
resume legislative session for a period
of morning business, with Senators
permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes
each, and that there be 30 minutes of
debate controlled by Senator ERNST or
her designee.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
tomorrow, the Senate will vote on a
resolution to terminate the President’s
emergency declaration—a declaration
that undermines our separation of pow-
ers in order to fund the President’s
wall with American taxpayer dollars,
despite Candidate Trump’s repeated
promises that Mexico would pay for it.
The resolution could not be any sim-
pler. All it says is this, one single sen-
tence: ‘‘Resolved by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assem-
bled, That, pursuant to section 202 of
the National Emergencies Act . . . the
national emergency declared by the
finding of the President on February
15, 2019, in Proclamation 9844 . . . is
hereby terminated.’’
That is it in the entirety. There are
no political games here. There is no
‘‘gotcha.’’ There is no discussion as to
whether we need a wall, whether there
is a crisis on the southern border. It
simply says that this is not an emer-
gency.
The vote tomorrow boils down to
something very simple for our Repub-
lican friends: Do you believe in the
Constitution and conservative prin-
ciples? There are all of these self-pro-
claimed conservatives. Well, the No. 1
tenet of conservatism is that no one,
particularly an Executive, a President,
should have too much power. That has
been what conservatives have stood for
through the centuries, and all of a sud-
den, because Donald Trump says he
wants to declare an emergency, are
people going to succumb?
The Founding Fathers would be roll-
ing in their graves. They would be roll-
ing in their graves for any President,
let alone this one who we know over-
reaches in terms of power and who we
know has no understanding of the ex-
quisite and delicate balance that
James Madison, George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson, and so many others
created in the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights.
Do our Republican friends stand for
conservative principles? Do they stand
for any principles at all, or do they just
take a loyalty pledge to President
Trump and meekly do whatever he
wants? It is that simple.
There are a lot of issues on which we
disagree. There are lots of times our
Republican friends bow to President
Trump, but there ought to be an excep-
tion. And if there ever were an excep-
tion, it should be this.
Many of my Republican colleagues
rightly stood up and told the President
not to take this action. Leader MCCON-
NELL himself said it was a bad idea, a
bad precedent, contravenes the power
of the purse, a dangerous step, an ero-
sion of congressional authority. And
they, our Republican friends, were
right. The President himself said he
‘‘didn’t need to do this.’’ That is not an
emergency.
Are we going to say that anytime a
President can’t get his or her way with
Congress, they can declare an emer-
gency and Congress will meekly shrug
its shoulders and walk by and bow in
obeisance to any President, Demo-
cratic or Republican? What a disgrace.
This is one of the true tests of our
Republican colleagues—one of the true
tests—because it has always been the
Democratic Party that has been for a
stronger Executive. Dwight Eisenhower
was worried about too much power
going to the President, and so was Ron-
ald Reagan. Where are our Republican
friends now? Has Donald Trump turned
this Republican Party and its conserv-
ative principles so inside out that we
can’t even get four votes to declare
that this isn’t an emergency, that we
can’t get 20 votes to say to the Presi-
dent that we will override this, because
this is far more important than any
view on the wall or the southern bor-
der, which we all know has been going
on for a long time. While the President
thinks it is an emergency, Congress
clearly didn’t. Even when Republicans
controlled the House and Senate, they
did nothing about the wall.
I have talked to a lot of my Repub-
lican colleagues. They know what this
is all about. Everyone here knows the
truth. The President did not declare an
emergency because there is one; he de-
clared an emergency because he lost in
Congress and wanted to go around it.
He has no principles in terms of con-
gressional balance of power. We know
that. We all know that. So to bow in
obeisance to him when we all know
what he is doing is so wrong—a low
moment for this Senate and its Repub-
lican friends.
When it comes to the Constitution,
you ought to stand up to fear and do
the right thing no matter who is in the
White House. My Republican friends
know the right thing to do. They
should not be afraid to do it.
Last I checked, we all took the same
oath of office. What did it say? ‘‘Uphold
the Constitution.’’
There are different views on the Con-
stitution, but I haven’t heard one con-
stitutional scholar—left, right, or cen-
ter—say that this upholding the Presi-
dent on this emergency is the right
thing to do in terms of the Constitu-
tion. I hope my Republican friends will
join us.
Now, it seems, from what I read in
the press reports this morning, that
some Senators are in search of a fig
leaf. They want to salve their con-
sciences. They know this is the wrong
thing to do.
They came up with this idea that will
change the emergency declaration for
future moments. Reports indicate that
a group of Republican Senators are
pushing legislation that would ignore
the President’s power grab but limit
future emergency declarations—what
bunk, what a fig leaf. That will not
pass.
To my friend, the Senator from Utah,
who I know does have constitutional
qualms, he is squirming. His legislation
will not pass.
Let me just read you what Leader
PELOSI said a few minutes ago. This is
from her statement:
Republican Senators are proposing new
legislation to allow the President to violate
the Constitution just this once in order to
give themselves cover. The House will not
take up this legislation to give President
Trump a pass.
Do you hear me, my colleagues—my
Republican colleagues? This will not
pass. This is not a salve. It is a very
transparent fig leaf. If you believe the
President is doing the wrong thing, if
you believe there shouldn’t be an emer-
gency, you don’t say: Well, in the Con-
gress we will introduce future legisla-
tion to change it, and, then, when the
President declares another emergency,
we will do new legislation to allow that
too.
Come on. This fig leaf is so easily
seen through, so easily blown aside
that it leaves the constitutional pre-
tensions of my Republican colleagues
naked. The fig leaf is gone. Don’t even
think that it will have anything to do
with what we are doing.
I hope my colleagues will stand
strong. What the Republicans want to
say with this fig leaf is, to paraphrase
St. Augustine, ‘‘Grant me the courage
to stand up to President Trump, but
not yet.’’
Next time and next time and next
time they will say the same thing.
Let’s do the right thing. Let’s tell
the President that he cannot use his
overreaching power to declare an emer-
gency when he couldn’t get Congress to

do what he wanted, and let’s not make
a joke of this by saying that there is
some legislation that will not pass in
the future that gives me the OK to vote
for this, to vote against this resolu-
tion. That fig leaf makes a mockery of
the whole Constitution and the whole
process.
BUDGET PROPOSAL
President Trump put out his budget
yesterday. It says ‘‘promises kept.’’
That is one of the biggest lies I have
ever seen because if you look at the
booklet, it is promises broken.
The President said he would never
cut Medicare and Medicaid. He slashes
them. It is an $845 billion cut to Medi-
care and $1.5 trillion cut to Medicaid.
The President says he believes in a
strong infrastructure bill. Promises
kept? This bill cuts transportation by
over 20 percent.
The President said that education is
the civil rights of this generation.
Promises kept? The President cuts edu-
cation dramatically.
On issue after issue after issue, the
President’s budget shows the real
President Trump and how far away he
is from the promises he makes to the
working people of America. Many of
them are catching on, many more will,
and this budget will be a way to show
who the President is.
Even worse—not ‘‘even worse,’’ but
compounding the injury—there are
huge giveaways to the wealthy, more
tax breaks for the wealthiest of Ameri-
cans. At a time when income distribu-
tion is getting more and more skewed
to the top, when so much of the wealth
of America and even the income of
America goes to the top few, to have a
budget that hurts the middle class,
that hurts those trying to struggle to
get to the middle class and makes it
even easier for the wealthy to garner
even more money—how out of touch is
this budget?
I repeat my challenge. Leader
MCCONNELL, this is your President.
You seem to go along with him. Put
this budget on the floor. Let’s see if
even a single Republican will vote for
it. I would like to ask every one of my
53 Republican colleagues: How many of
you will say, ‘‘I support this budget’’? I
bet not one—not one.
This budget is a slap on the face to
every American who has worked hard
every day, paid his or her taxes, ex-
pects Medicare in retirement, expects
some way to afford healthcare for re-
tirement.
President Trump’s budget is inhu-
mane. We Democrats will fight it and
fight these heartless cuts at every sin-
gle turn.
TARIFFS
Finally, on China, yesterday U.S.
Trade Representative Robert
Lighthizer told the Senate Finance
Committee that he could predict the
success of a trade agreement with
China, saying there are major issues
left to be resolved. I hope these major
issues are the sinew—the meat—of
what China does to us.
This is not an issue of soybeans or
imports or balance of trade, which is
getting worse, even with what Presi-
dent Trump did. This is an issue of Chi-
na’s stealing the greatness of the
American economy. This is an example
of China’s being able to cascade huge
amounts of products into America and
not letting us sell our products freely
there, or seldom, under such conditions
that it isn’t worth it, such as turning
our intellectual property and know-
how to China or to Chinese Govern-
ment-controlled companies.
Lighthizer is doing a good job, but I
worry that the President is more fo-
cused on getting a win than getting a
good deal. The President should be
proud that he stood up to North Korea
and walked away. He should do the
same thing here.
President Xi is not going to give him
much, and the President should have
the guts to walk away because China is
in a much weaker position, in part, be-
cause of the tariffs that the President
correctly imposed on China.
If the President walks away from a
weak deal, the odds are very high that
he will be able to come back to the
table with a much better deal because
China will have to relent. Stay strong.
Don’t cave. This is America’s whole fu-
ture at stake.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Hawaii.
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, two
weeks ago, the Senate broke a century
of precedent and confirmed a judge,
Eric Miller, to the Ninth Circuit over
the objection of both home State Sen-
ators.
Last week, the majority leader filed
cloture on two circuit court nominees,
Paul Matey for the Third Circuit and
Neomi Rao to replace Brett Kavanaugh
in the DC Circuit.
Yesterday, Paul Matey became the
second person in Senate history, after
Eric Miller, to be confirmed without
blue slips from both home State Sen-
ators. By eliminating the blue slip—a
century-old policy that requires mean-
ingful consultation between the Presi-
dent and home State Senators on judi-
cial nominations—Senate Republicans
have been able to speed through con-
firming partisan judges with strong
ideological perspectives and agendas.
Donald Trump appointed 30 circuit
court judges in his first 2 years in of-
fice. That is 17 percent of the Federal
appellate bench. By contrast, President
Obama appointed only 16 circuit court
judges in his first 2 years in office, and
President George Bush appointed 17.
Donald Trump and the majority lead-
er, with the help of the chair of the Ju-
diciary Committee, are breaking near-
ly every rule that stands in their way
to stack, at breakneck speed, the Fed-
eral courts with deeply partisan and
ideological judges.
And why are they doing this? They
are packing the courts to achieve,
through the courts, what they haven’t
been able to accomplish through legis-
lation or executive action—under-
mining Roe v. Wade, dismantling the
Affordable Care Act, eliminating pro-
tections for workers, women, minori-
ties, LGBTQ individuals, immigrants,
and the environment.
The courts, with non-Trump judges,
have been the constitutional guardrails
stopping the Trump administration’s
deeply questionable policies and deci-
sions, such as separating immigrant
children from their parents, summarily
ending DACA protections, and asking
whether census respondents are U.S.
citizens. All of these administration
decisions have been stopped, for now,
by Federal judges.
Trump’s judicial nominees have ex-
tensive records of advocating for right-
wing, ideologically-driven causes. In
fact, these records are the reasons they
are being nominated in the first place.
The nominees tell us to ignore their
records and trust them when they say
they will follow precedent and rule im-
partially, but after they are confirmed
as judges, they can ignore promises
made under oath during their con-
firmation hearing because they can.
Short of impeaching these judges,
there is nothing we can do about it—
great for them, not great for Ameri-
cans.
By the way, the average Trump judge
tends to be younger, less diverse, and
less experienced. They will be making
rules that affect our lives for decades.
This week we are considering yet an-
other Trump nominee, Neomi Rao, who
should make us seriously ask how far
the majority leader is willing to go to
let Donald Trump pack the courts with
extreme nominees and undermine the
independence and impartiality of the
Federal judiciary.
Neomi Rao is a nominee who has not
only expressed offensive and controver-
sial views in her twenties, but she has
also continued to make concerning
statements as a law professor. Her re-
cent actions as Donald Trump’s Admin-
istrator of the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, have
shown that her controversial state-
ments in her twenties cannot be ig-
nored as merely youthful indiscretions.
At the hearing, I asked her why, as a
law professor, she defended dwarf-toss-
ing by arguing that a ban on dwarf-
tossing ‘‘coerces individuals’’ to accept
a societal view of dignity that negates
the dignity of an individual’s choice to
be tossed.
Does she seriously believe that
dwarfs who are tossed do not share a
societal view of dignity that being
tossed is an affront to human dignity?
Ms. Rao asserted that she was only
talking about a particular case and not
taking a position one way or another
on these issues. It is hard to under-
stand what distinction she is making,
but describing a ban on dwarf-tossing
as not coercion is bizarre, especially
coming from someone who purports to
worry about the dignitary harm caused
by affirmative action or diversity in
education programs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1811
March 13, 2019
When I asked her about the strong
ideological perspectives reflected in
her writings and public statements, she
claimed that she ‘‘come[s] here to this
committee with no agenda and no ide-
ology and [she] would strive, if [she]
were confirmed, to follow the law in
every case.’’
Ms. Rao would have us ignore all of
her controversial statements and posi-
tions and simply trust her blanket as-
sertion that she has no agenda or ide-
ology. In this, she is like the other
Trump judicial nominees.
As a college student, Ms. Rao criti-
cized environmental student groups for
focusing on ‘‘three major environ-
mental boogymen, the greenhouse ef-
fect, the depleting ozone layer, and the
dangers of acid rain . . . though all
three theories have come under serious
scientific attack.’’
More than two decades later, Ms. Rao
demonstrated the same disregard for
environmental concerns as the Admin-
istrator of the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA. In this
position she has consistently used her
power and influence to strip away crit-
ical protections for clean air and clean
water. For example, Ms. Rao supported
efforts to replace the Clean Power
Plan, which would have reduced green-
house gas emissions with a rule that
would actually increase air pollution
and could lead to up to 1,400 additional
premature deaths.
Her claim that she would simply fol-
low precedent is also contradicted by
her statements and positions relating
to racial injustice. In her twenties,
while discussing the Yale Women’s
Center and what she called ‘‘cultural
awareness groups,’’ she argued that
‘‘[m]yths of sexual and racial oppres-
sion propogate [sic] themselves, create
hysteria and finally lead to the forma-
tion of some whining new group.’’
I just wonder, what are these whining
new groups that she refers to? Could it
be women who want to support pro-
grams that support women?
In 2015, as a law professor, she dispar-
agingly described the Supreme Court
case that reaffirmed the Fair Housing
Act’s protections against disparate im-
pact discrimination as a ‘‘rul[ing] by
talking points,’’ not law.
In Texas Department of Housing v.
Inclusive Communities Project, the Su-
preme Court recognized that the dis-
parate impact doctrine is an important
way ‘‘to counteract unconscious preju-
dices and disguised animus’’ based on a
policy’s discriminatory effects. Despite
the Supreme Court precedent, when
Ms. Rao became the OIRA Adminis-
trator, she began working to weaken
rules protecting against disparate im-
pact discrimination—upheld by the Su-
preme Court, by the way—particularly
in the area of housing.
Her writings and actions related to
sexual assault and rape are another
reason we should be hesitant to believe
her claim that she will merely follow
the law free of her strongly held ideo-
logical views. In her twenties, Ms. Rao
repeatedly wrote offensive statements
about date rape and sexual assault that
disparaged survivors. In writing about
date rape, she argued that if a woman
‘‘drinks to the point where she can no
longer choose, well, getting to that
point was part of her choice.’’
In criticizing the feminist movement,
she asserted she was ‘‘not arguing that
date rape victims ask for it’’ but then
argued that ‘‘when playing the modern
dating game, women have to under-
stand and accept the consequences of
their sexuality.’’
At her hearing and in a subsequent
letter to this Committee, Ms. Rao tried
to walk away from these offensive
writings, stating that she ‘‘regret[s]’’
some of them and believes ‘‘[v]ictims
should not be blamed.’’ But at the
hearing she continued to insist that
her prior controversial statements
were ‘‘only trying to make the com-
monsense observation about the rela-
tionship between drinking and becom-
ing a victim.’’ That is not how her
statements came across.
She seems to acknowledge that by
further claiming that if she were ad-
dressing campus sexual assault and
rape now, she ‘‘would have more empa-
thy and perspective.’’ That claim rings
hollow, as she only recently oversaw
the Trump administration’s proposed
title IX rule that would make it harder
for college sexual assault survivors to
come forward and obtain justice.
Among other things, the proposed
rule would require schools to conduct a
live hearing where the accused’s rep-
resentatives can cross-examine the sur-
vivor. It would also have the school use
a higher burden of proof for sexual mis-
conduct cases than for other mis-
conduct cases.
I will close by noting that Ms. Rao
previously criticized the Senate Judici-
ary Committee’s confirmation hearings
for judicial nominees. In writing about
the Supreme Court confirmation proc-
ess, she complained that nominees are
‘‘coached to choose from certain stock
answers,’’ such as ‘‘repeatedly
alleg[ing] fidelity to the law.’’
Back then she readily acknowledged
that ‘‘judges draw on a variety of tools
in interpreting the law, and that these
tools differ for judges based on their
constitutional values.’’ But now that
she has been nominated to become a
judge, she is the one giving the Judici-
ary Committee the formulaic ‘‘stock
answers’’ that she criticized.
Before she became a judicial nomi-
nee, she indicated that nominees
should not be confirmed ‘‘based on in-
cantations of the right formulas with-
out an examination of their actual be-
liefs.’’ We should hold her to her own
words.
An examination of Ms. Rao’s record
and actual beliefs show that the con-
troversial views she held in her
twenties are not so different from her
statements and actions as a legal pro-
fessional. That is why I will be voting
against Ms. Rao’s nomination, and I
strongly urge my colleagues to do the
same.
I yield the floor.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, desperate
to distract from the $93 trillion price
tag of their so-called Green New Deal,
the Democratic leadership here in the
Senate has been coming down to the
floor to claim that Republicans are ig-
noring climate change.
On February 14, the Democratic lead-
er came to the floor and said: ‘‘Since
Republicans took control of this Cham-
ber in 2015, they have not brought a
single Republican bill to meaningfully
reduce carbon emissions to the floor of
the Senate. Not one bill.’’ That is a
quote from the Democratic leader just
a month ago.
That would be news to me, and I
think it would be news to some Demo-
cratic Senators here, as well. On Janu-
ary 14 of this year, for example, the
President signed into law the Nuclear
Energy Innovation and Modernization
Act. That legislation, led by Repub-
lican Senator BARRASSO and cospon-
sored by both Republicans and Demo-
crats, paves the way for new advanced
nuclear technologies, which will help
further reduce carbon emissions.
Here is what the Democratic ranking
member of the Environment and Public
Works Committee had to say about
this bill:
Nuclear power serves as our nation’s larg-
est source of reliable, carbon-free energy,
which can help combat the negative impacts
of climate change and at the same time, fos-
ter economic opportunities for Americans.
. . . This is another important step in our
fight against climate change.
That is from the Democratic ranking
member of the Senate Environment
and Public Works Committee. Let me
repeat that. ‘‘This is another impor-
tant step in our fight against climate
change.’’ That is coming from a key
Democrat on a key committee that
deals with this issue. That is not a Re-
publican talking; that is the Demo-
cratic ranking member of the Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee.
Then, of course, there is the Fur-

S1812 March 13, 2019
became law in September. This legisla-
tion will help support the development
of advanced nuclear reactor designs,
which will increase America’s supply of
clean and reliable energy.
Here is what the junior Democratic
Senator from Rhode Island had to say
about this legislation:
Partnerships between the private sector
and our world-class scientists at national
labs will help bring new technologies forward
to compete against polluting forms of en-
ergy. . . . I am proud to have worked with
Senator CRAPO to get this bipartisan energy
legislation over the finish line.
Here is what the junior Democratic
Senator from New Jersey had to say:
Reducing our carbon emissions as quickly
as possible requires prioritizing the develop-
ment and commercialization of advanced nu-
clear reactors, which will be even safer and
more efficient than current reactors. Pas-
sage of this legislation will provide critical
support to startup companies here in the
United States that are investing billions of
dollars in these next generation reactor de-
signs.
Here is what the Democratic whip
himself had to say:
I was proud to join Senator CRAPO on this
bipartisan bill.
I could go on. I could talk about the
2018 farm bill, which, in the words of
Earth Justice, contains ‘‘a number of
provisions that incentivize more cli-
mate-friendly practices.’’ I serve on
that committee. I was involved in the
conservation title and the drafting of
that, including a number of provisions
in there. I could talk about the provi-
sion in the Bipartisan Budget Act of
2018 to ensure the completion of our
first two new nuclear reactors in a gen-
eration, which will prevent 10 million
tons of carbon dioxide emissions annu-
ally; or the extension of wind and solar
clean energy tax credits; or the bipar-
tisan America’s Water Infrastructure
Act, which will help advance hydro-
power projects—a significant source of
emission-free energy.
Suffice it to say that Republican
Senators have passed more than one
bill to protect our environment and
help America achieve a clean energy
future, and we are not stopping here.
So why all the misdirection on the part
of the Democrats? I am sure Democrats
think it is politically advantageous to
portray themselves as the only party
that is invested in clean energy.
Then, of course, Democrats are des-
perate to distract from the details of
the $93 trillion Green New Deal that
their Presidential candidates have em-
braced. That is right—I said $93 tril-
lion. One think tank has released the
first estimate of what the Green New
Deal will cost, and the answer is be-
tween $51 trillion and $93 trillion over
10 years. That is an incomprehensible
amount of money.
For comparison, the entire Federal
budget for 2019 is less than $5 trillion.
The 2017 gross domestic product for the
entire world, the entire planet, came to
$80.7 trillion—more than $10 trillion
less than Democrats are proposing to
spend on the Green New Deal. Ninety-
three trillion dollars is more than the
amount of money the U.S. Government
has spent in its entire history. Since
1789, when the Constitution went into
effect, the Federal Government has
spent a total of $83.2 trillion. That is
right—it has taken us 230 years to
spend the amount of money Democrats
want to spend in 10.
Even attempting to pay for the Green
New Deal would devastate working
families, who would be hit with incred-
ibly high new taxes. Let’s be very clear
about this. This is not a plan that can
be paid for by taxing the rich. Taxing
every family making more than
$200,000 a year at a 100-percent tax rate
for 10 years wouldn’t get Democrats
anywhere close to $93 trillion. Taxing
every family making more than
$100,000 a year at a 100-percent tax rate
for 10 years would still leave Demo-
crats short of $93 trillion.
Of course, the amount of money we
are talking about, as horrifying as it
is, is just one negative aspect of the
Green New Deal. Democrats’ Green
New Deal is a full-blown socialist fan-
tasy that would put the government in
charge of not just energy but
healthcare and all the other various as-
pects of the American economy.
One of the Green New Deal’s authors
posted and then deleted a document
from her website noting that the Green
New Deal would provide economic se-
curity for those unable or unwilling to
work. That is right—in the Democrats’
socialist fantasies, apparently the gov-
ernment will provide you with eco-
nomic security if you are unwilling to
work. Let’s hope there are enough will-
ing workers to fund those who are un-
willing to work. After all, that $93 tril-
lion has to come from somewhere.
It is no wonder that Democrats are
trying to change the subject when it
comes to the Green New Deal. They
don’t want to have to defend the spe-
cifics of their plan because their plan
is, frankly, indefensible.
If the Democrats would like to have
a serious discussion about energy, they
should repudiate the unfathomably ex-
pensive Green New Deal and join Re-
publicans in focusing on ways to secure
a clean energy future without dev-
astating the economy or bankrupting
working families.

TRIBUTE TO CHRISTIAN COOK
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise to
recognize a gentleman by the name of
Christian Cook.
Christian Cook has been a vital mem-
ber of the staff on the Senate’s Select
Committee on Intelligence for the last
8 years and has been my personal des-
ignee on the committee for the major-
ity of that time. Throughout Chris-
tian’s career, he has continuously put
his country above himself and has been
tirelessly dedicated to achieving excel-
lence in all areas of his work across the
national security spectrum.
His passion to serve first led him to
become a special agent for the U.S. Se-
cret Service, where he expertly con-
ducted investigations of violations of
Federal criminal law and threats
against the President and Vice Presi-
dent. He worked diligently to ensure
that the safety and security of the
President, the Vice President, and nu-
merous foreign heads of state were
without question. Christian also served
a pivotal role in the design, prepara-
tion and execution of the security plan
for the 2005 Presidential Inaugural Pa-
rade. Christian’s focus on supporting
national security efforts continued
when he transitioned to the private
sector.
While working with Booz Allen Ham-
ilton, he skillfully developed time-sen-
sitive and complex tactical solutions
for classified U.S. intelligence clients.
With The Cohen Group, Christian pro-
vided strategic insights that enabled
key clients to meet their evolving
global security needs. At the USIS, he
also seamlessly managed complex,
classified programs for the U.S. intel-
ligence community and for Federal law
enforcement Agencies, substantially
strengthening their counterterrorism
capabilities.
Christian subsequently joined the
Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence. It is hard to know where to
start to list his many accomplish-
ments. In the last 8 years, he has done
everything, and he has done it all to
his own exceedingly high standards. He
initially served with the audits team
and was intricately involved in the
committee’s oversight of the U.S. in-
telligence community’s 17 intelligence
Agencies. By conducting thorough re-
views of specific intelligence programs,
his expert knowledge and deep insight
enabled the committee to identify
items of concern and outline proposals
for their improvement.
It quickly became clear to me that
Christian had an unsurpassed capa-
bility to conduct intelligence oversight
but also a unique ability to analyze
complex challenges and identify solu-
tions. At that time, I personally se-
lected him to be my designee on the
committee. As my designee, he
expertly analyzed and advised me on
the myriad of threats across the intel-
ligence landscape.
He also flawlessly facilitated the de-
velopment, passage, and implementa-
tion of critical intelligence-related leg-
islation in this body.
Several of Christian’s colleagues
have had the privilege to work with
him for years. When asked what words
best describe Christian, numerous clear
themes resound, such as dedication, his
passion for our Nation and its security,

very high standards, devotion to mis-
sion, and for always ensuring that the
trains run on time.
Without fail, Christian is the person
all staff goes to for insight, for guid-
ance, and assistance with getting their
job done. His colleagues appreciate his
honesty, his integrity, and his ability
to disarm anyone with a laugh and a
warm word of appreciation.
When I became chairman of the Sen-
ate Select Committee on Intelligence,
Christian was my clear choice to serve
as my senior policy adviser and deputy
staff director. In these critical roles,
Christian expertly led the development
and implementation of the strategic di-
rection for the 15 Members of the U.S.
Senate who sit on this committee and
the committee staff. Regularly arriv-
ing at the office long before sunrise, he
directed the day-to-day planning and
execution of the committee’s key over-
sight functions, to include establishing
and managing the committee’s com-
plex open and closed hearing schedule,
facilitating the confirmation process
for numerous Presidential nominees,
and managing the ongoing interactions
between members of the committee
and the leaders of 17 intelligence Agen-
cies. He also adeptly coordinated the
collaboration with other congressional
committees and managed the daily ac-
tivities of the committee’s professional
staff and administrative staff.
Separately and concurrently, Chris-
tian also continued to serve as my in-
telligence and national security advi-
sor, providing keen insight and valu-
able advice on the full range of na-
tional security challenges. Throughout
my time as chairman of the com-
mittee, I have always known I could
count on Christian to provide me with
critical background and sage advice on
every issue, without fail, thanks in
part to his uncanny ability to call to
mind any facts he picked up in the last
8 years.
I note for the record the length of
this list of responsibilities reflects
Christian’s hard work, long hours, and
dedication. It also highlights the value
he brings to me and to the committee.
Christian has the foresight to antici-
pate problems, the instinct to pick the
right time to drive forward, and the su-
perior judgment to know the path right
ahead.
Christian’s tireless service was made
possible not just because of his own
dedication and character but because
he was confident in the love and sup-
port of his wife Christina and the ado-
ration of three young and precious
sons—Casson, Callen, and Caulder. For
their own sacrifice and for their will-
ingness to share Christian with the
committee, we are indebted to them.
I might say, on a personal note, at
times he could, on weekends or breaks,
be home with his three boys and his
wife, instead he has been on an air-
plane with me flying somewhere
around the world that nobody would
consider a vacation site—traveling
halfway around the world and back in
less than 31⁄2 days, and that was done
regularly. Now he will have an oppor-
tunity to get some normalcy to his life.
Christian’s unwavering support to me
has been impeccable. I am delighted to
have the opportunity to publicly thank
him and to note my personal apprecia-
tion for his dedication. He has earned
our deepest respect, our admiration,
and we will miss his devotion and his
friendship. His positive impact on U.S.
national security and his legacy within
the Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence will remain for years to come.
I know I join the other 14 members in
publicly saying to Christian that we
wish him great success in the next
chapter of life. We hope this one gives
him the opportunity to see his children
grow and to grow his relationship with
his wife.
I yield the floor.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the
news cycle is relentless here in Wash-
ington, DC, and between cable TV and
social media, it is pretty hard to re-
member what happened an hour or a
day or a week ago, but it is important
to talk about the context surrounding
today’s circumstances, and that is why
I wanted to come talk a little bit more
about what is happening on our south-
ern border.
Twelve hundred miles of Texas is
common border with Mexico, and we
are at ground zero when it comes to
what comes across the border and what
happens at the border. Frankly, it is a
lot more complicated than most people
seem to appreciate, at least by the way
they talk about it.
Not only is the border a source of
economic energy for our country, by
trade and legitimate travel, we know
our border communities themselves are
among the safest in the country. Their
crime statistics are basically equiva-
lent to that of any other comparable
city in any other part of the country,
but what happens across the border is a
very different story.
Some of the most dangerous cities in
Mexico are right there along the bor-
der, primarily because they are still
controlled by the cartels that operate
what are called plazas where they es-
sentially take tolls or shake down peo-
ple who are trying to come across for
whatever purpose it might be, whether
it is people coming across to find a job
in the United States or drug traffickers
or human traffickers—people selling
women and children for sex or human
servitude.
So it is a complicated scenario, to be
sure, but one thing I can tell you is,
there is a humanitarian crisis at the
border that was not manufactured by
the Trump administration. In fact, the
denial in which a lot of our Democratic
colleagues find themselves I think is
more related to the fact that President
Trump is the one currently identifying
it rather than the facts on the ground
because, in 2014, President Obama
called what was happening at the bor-
der a humanitarian crisis, and that did
not seem to be a controversial com-
ment at the time, but now that Presi-
dent Trump is calling this a crisis and
emergency, people, unfortunately,
can’t take off their partisan jersey, and
many call it a fake emergency or fake
crisis, which is demonstrably false.
Let’s go back to 2014. That year,
about 68,000 families were apprehended
at the southern border, an over-
whelming number. This, coupled with
an unprecedented surge of unaccom-
panied children, led President Obama,
as I mentioned, to call this a ‘‘growing
humanitarian and security crisis.’’
That was President Obama. He was
right, especially about the growing
part.
Let me just pause for a moment to
talk about why are we seeing children
and families coming across the border
as opposed to adult men.
We detained about 400,000 people
coming across the border last year, but
we are seeing more and more unaccom-
panied children and family units com-
ing across the border. The simple fact
is, the criminal organizations that ex-
ploit this vulnerability at our border
have figured out what our laws provide
for and where the gaps are, and they
realize, if an unaccompanied child or a
family unit comes across the border,
current law requires us to separate the
adult from the child—because we don’t
want to put a child in a jail or deten-
tion facility—and place them, through
Health and Human Services, with a
sponsor, ultimately, in the United
States.
Once they get a sponsor in the United
States, then it may be years, if ever,
before their asylum claim is actually
heard in front of an immigration judge.
The fact is, in the vast majority of cir-
cumstances, that asylum claim will be
granted—or I should say mooted by the
fact that people don’t show up months
and years later for their hearing in
front of the immigration judge but
simply melt into the great American
landscape.
In this case, the cartels win, and
American border security loses because
our Democratic colleagues simply
refuse to work with us to make com-
monsense fixes to this broken asylum
system which allows the cartels and
children and family units to essentially
exploit the vulnerabilities in our laws
and successfully make their way into
the country.
That is what they call a pull factor.
There are push factors because of the
violence occurring in countries in Cen-
tral America, but the pull factor is the
fact that if you try to come to the
United States as an unaccompanied

child or a family unit, you will likely
succeed. So it should be no surprise to
any of us that these numbers continue
to grow.
Back when President Obama talked
about this being a growing humani-
tarian and security crisis, there were
68,000 family units apprehended at the
border. In the last 5 months alone this
year, there have been more than 136,000
family units apprehended along the
southern border.
Historically, we witness the highest
numbers of apprehensions in the spring
and summer months, so I anticipate
things will not get better—they will
only get worse—in the months ahead.
My State and our border communities
are certainly feeling the brunt of these
growing numbers.
We also know, as the Border Patrol
has told us, that the cartels that move
illegal drugs into the United States fre-
quently try to flood the border with
migrants, these family units, in order
to distract law enforcement personnel
from the heroin or the methamphet-
amine or the synthetic opioids, mainly
fentanyl, that come across our border
and poison so many Americans.
We know that last year alone, more
than 70,000 Americans died of drug
overdoses. A substantial amount of
that was opioids, including the syn-
thetic fentanyl. Frequently, the pre-
cursors come from China through Mex-
ico and into the United States, and 90
percent of the heroin used in the
United States comes from Mexico. This
is a serious matter, and we should not
turn a blind eye to it.
Compared to this time last year, fam-
ily unit apprehensions have grown 200
percent in the Rio Grande Valley Sec-
tor. That is McAllen, TX, and that
area. They are up more than 490 per-
cent in the Del Rio Sector, and, most
staggering, in the El Paso Sector, fam-
ily unit apprehensions have increased
more than 1,600 percent.
For those who believe this is some-
how a fake emergency or not really a
crisis, I would ask them: If those num-
bers were doubled or tripled, would
they believe there is a crisis or an
emergency? I believe there is now, and
I believe those who deny that a crisis
exists are simply turning a blind eye to
it for, unfortunately, mainly partisan
purposes.
Despite what many on the left claim,
there is indeed a humanitarian crisis
on the border. In addition to the waves
of Central Americans arriving by the
thousands, we are also trying to stop
the flow of illegal narcotics, as I said,
and combat the disgusting practice of
human smuggling.
Last week, the Senate Judiciary
Committee heard from U.S. Customs
and Border Protection Commissioner
Kevin McAleenan, who leads the more
than 60,000 professionals working to
provide security and a safe place for
trade to come across our ports of
entry. Many of these employees of Cus-
toms and Border Protection call Texas
home and work alongside of State and
local law enforcement to protect us
and our neighbors from the dangerous
goods and, yes, persons trying to cross
the border illegally.
Of course, the C in CBP stands for
Customs, and they are also charged
with promoting the safe and efficient
movement of legitimate trade and
travel. In Texas, given our proximity
to the border, given our location, that
is a big task. Our State is the No. 1 ex-
porter in the country, with exports last
year totaling more than $315 billion.
That is exporting things that we grow,
livestock that we raise, and manufac-
tured goods that we make. We sell
those to Mexico, our biggest customer
far and away.
Folks who live and work along the
southern border are proud of the strong
bonds our country has with our south-
ern neighbor and the dynamic culture
in the region. Many have family on
both sides of the border, which makes
it an extraordinarily unique place in
our country. Thanks to the dedicated
Federal, State, and local law enforce-
ment officials, flourishing businesses,
and a vibrant community, the border
region is thriving.
I was on the telephone with one of
my constituents from McAllen, TX,
yesterday. He said: Our cities on the
border are safe. You would think, from
what you hear from the national dis-
cussion and debates in Washington,
that people have to wear body armor in
McAllen, TX.
I said: Well, part of the problem is
that people are confusing the dan-
gerous flow of goods and people across
the border with actual violence occur-
ring on the border.
Just to reiterate, our border commu-
nities on the U.S. side are some of the
safest in the country. On the other
side, for example, Juarez, which is on
the other side of the border from El
Paso, has historically been one of the
most dangerous places on the planet,
as well as Tamaulipas, which is the
Mexican State right opposite of
McAllen—again, a hot bed of cartel ac-
tivity and violence.
But U.S. cities, I would say, are rel-
atively safe, just like any other com-
parable city in the United States. So
people perhaps not knowing better or,
maybe, perhaps just trying to make a
better story out of the facts, and I
think conflate these ideas. But there is
no doubt that the drugs, the human
trafficking, and the masses of human-
ity coming across our border are cre-
ating a crisis at the border of a human-
itarian and security nature.
Of course, between the ports of
entry—and the ports of entry are where
the legitimate trade and travel come
across our international bridges—there
are vast swaths of land that are rel-
atively unpatrolled. The closest Border
Patrol agent could be miles away—
something human smugglers know and
they exploit. These aren’t good Sa-
maritans leading immigrants to a bet-
ter life. They are criminals who put
profit before people and have zero re-
gard for human life.
According to a 2017 study by Doctors
Without Borders, 68 percent of the mi-
grants reported being victims of vio-
lence during transit from Mexico or
through Mexico, and 31 percent of the
women surveyed had been sexually
abused during the journey. These are
the migrants who turn themselves over
to the tender mercies of these criminal
organizations. Sixty-eight percent have
been victims of violence, and 31 percent
of the women have been sexually as-
saulted. The journey these families
face on their way to the United States
is a harrowing one, and some of them
don’t make it. We have to continue
working to stop anyone even consid-
ering this journey from attempting it.
I still remember going to Falfurrias,
TX, which is away from the border but
is a Border Patrol checkpoint. What
happens is that the coyotes will bring
people across the border, put them in
stash houses in sickening and inhu-
mane conditions, and, then, when the
time is right, put them in a vehicle and
transit them up our highway system.
The Falfurrias checkpoint in Brooks
County is one of the ones that checks
people coming through on their way
into the mainland.
But what happens is that the smug-
glers will tell the migrants: Get out of
the car before the checkpoint. Here is a
milk carton or jug full of water.
Maybe they give them some candy
bars or the like, and say: We will see
you on the other side.
So many of the migrants—particu-
larly in the hottest part of the summer
in Texas—unfortunately, die making
that trip. I have been to Brooks County
and have seen some of the unidentified
bones and remains of migrants who
died trying to make that trip.
Of course, you can imagine coming
from Central America in the first
place. By the time they even get to
Falfurrias and Brooks County and the
checkpoint, many of them are already
suffering from exposure, including de-
hydration.
As you can imagine, during the time
I have been in the Senate, I have spent
a significant amount of time along the
border meeting with CBP personnel,
law enforcement officials, small busi-
nesses, landowners, community lead-
ers, and other citizens about the chal-
lenges they and we are facing and what
it is we might be able to do here in
Washington to help. What I have heard
repeatedly is that we need a three-
pronged approach.
I know we are primarily focused on
or obsessed with physical barriers, and
that is certainly a piece of it, but that
is only one of the three elements that
we need to deal with border security.
We need barriers in hard-to-control
areas. We need personnel. We need the
Border Patrol. And, yes, we need tech-
nology. Technology can be a force mul-
tiplier, we all know, to help the Border
Patrol identify drug smugglers or
human traffickers or coyotes bringing
human or economic migrants across.

what is necessarily best for another. So
this idea that we would build a phys-
ical barrier across the entire State is
just nonsense. That is not what the
President has proposed.
I remember that former Secretary of
Homeland Security John Kelly, later
the Chief of Staff, said: We are not pro-
posing to build a wall ‘‘from sea to
shining sea’’—because he knew what
we know, and that is that what works
best in one sector doesn’t work well in
another.
So we need to keep both the funding
and the flexibility to provide the most
needed resources that will work best.
That is not something we should be
trying to dictate or micromanage from
thousands of miles away. As I men-
tioned, the humanitarian crisis has
evolved significantly since 2014, and I
have no doubt that it will continue to
evolve in the coming years. We need to
continue the conversation with experts
on the ground and stakeholders on the
ground and make sure that we can
adapt as the threat evolves.
Based on feedback from my constitu-
ents in Texas, the funding bill we
passed last month included five specific
areas, including the Santa Ana Wildlife
Refuge and the National Butterfly Cen-
ter, where barriers cannot be con-
structed. It also included language
stating that DHS must consult with
local elected officials in certain coun-
ties and towns. I happen to believe that
kind of consultation can be very posi-
tive and can lead to a win-win situa-
tion.
I will mention just one location in
Hidalgo County, TX. They are right
there on the river, and they had to im-
prove the levees because they were
worried about the rains leading to
floods and the destruction that would
follow. In order to deal with improve-
ment of the levee system, they actu-
ally worked with the Border Patrol to
come up with what they called a levee
wall, which helped the Border Patrol
control the flow of migrants to places
where they could be accessed most eas-
ily, but it also provided the improve-
ment in the levee system that helped
the Rio Grande Valley, and, particu-
larly, Hidalgo County to develop those
counties without prohibitively high or
even nonexistent insurance coverage.
So that is an example of how, by con-
sulting with local stakeholders, we can
come up with win-win scenarios.
The border region’s future is bright,
thanks to the dedicated law enforce-
ment professionals, elected officials,
and business community leaders who
keep it safe and prosperous, but we
simply can’t turn a blind eye and ig-
nore the high level of illegal migration
and substances moving across our bor-
der. We can’t turn a blind eye to the
migrants being left for dead in the
ranchlands by human smugglers. We
can’t ignore the humanitarian crisis
that continues to grow at an expo-
nential rate.
The President’s emergency declara-
tion was his commitment to finally ad-
dress the problems that overwhelmed
our communities along the southern
border—both in 2014, when President
Obama identified it, and today. It is
our duty to deliver real results—not
only for the people of Texas but for our
friends to the south.
I have heard the concerns raised by
my constituents and colleagues about
the use of emergency powers in this
situation, and I share some of those
concerns. I still believe that the reg-
ular appropriations process should al-
ways be used, but, unfortunately, we
saw a refusal on the part of the Speak-
er of the House and others to engage in
bona fide negotiations on border secu-
rity funding, and that left the adminis-
tration with what it deemed to be an
inadequate source of revenue to do the
border security measures they felt they
needed in order to address the humani-
tarian crisis.
Rather than engaging with the Presi-
dent and debating whether the Presi-
dent has the authority to declare a na-
tional emergency for border security—
which he clearly does—I think our dis-
cussions should focus on the structure
of emergency powers laws moving for-
ward and whether Congress has dele-
gated too much power, not just to this
President but to any President under
these circumstances.
I think Brandeis University did a sur-
vey of all of the congressional grants of
emergency powers that Congress has
made over the last years and has iden-
tified 123 separate statutes which, if
the President declares a national emer-
gency, will allow the President to re-
program money that has been appro-
priated by Congress for various pur-
poses. I think that is a serious over-
delegation of authority by Congress to
the executive branch, which is why I
intend to cosponsor a bill introduced
by our colleague, Senator LEE from
Utah, to give Congress a stronger voice
in the processes under the National
Emergencies Act.
I am going to continue to come to
the floor to argue with my colleagues
about what we need in that unique part
of our country, which is the border re-
gion, not only to have a prosperous re-
gion in America but also to have a
safer America. It is not as simple,
frankly, as some people would have it
be, and it should not be the subject of
partisanship and game-playing, like we
have seen the debate over border secu-
rity under the President’s request be-
come.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire.
Ms. HASSAN. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent.
It is good to hear from my colleague
from Texas. I am here to talk about
two different issues, but I did just want
to say that I have had the pleasure and
honor of visiting Senator CORNYN’s
wonderful State. In fact, I was at the
border last spring. It is a beautiful
State that is full of hard-working and
welcoming people. Certainly, our men
and women on the frontlines at the
border are working incredibly hard and
have a lot of excellent ideas about how
to secure the border.
I do just want to make one point,
which is simply that in addressing a
humanitarian crisis at the border, we
shouldn’t create another one by sepa-
rating families at the border. To be
clear, there is nothing in our law that
requires families to be separated at the
border. We simply should not be harm-
ing children as we deal with this issue.
I would welcome Senator CORNYN to
our Homeland Security Committee,
where we have discussed the various
options that would keep us from hurt-
ing children in our care.
TITLE X
Mr. President, I am here today to
rise in opposition to the Trump admin-
istration’s domestic gag rule on the
title X program.
For more than 40 years, title X has
provided women and families with
comprehensive family planning and
preventive health services. Congress
created title X with a strong bipartisan
vote, with Members of both parties rec-
ognizing how vital the services it pro-
vides are. Since then, for those in rural
communities, for low-income women
and men, and for members of the
LGBTQ community, title X-supported
health centers have been a major
source of preventive care and reproduc-
tive health services, including cancer
screenings, birth control, HIV and STI
tests, and counseling services.
Title X helps communities and peo-
ple throughout my home State of New
Hampshire. Title X-funded centers de-
liver care to nearly 18,000 Granite
Staters annually, and title X-supported
Planned Parenthood centers serve 60
percent of those Granite Staters. In
some parts of my State, there are no
options other than a title X center, and
if other options exist, they don’t pro-
vide the same expertise and commit-
ment to reproductive healthcare serv-
ices that title X centers offer. Commu-
nity health centers around my State do
important work, but they have told me
that they will not be able to replace
the services lost if the administration
is successful in its efforts to target
Planned Parenthood.
The Trump administration’s gag rule
is simply dangerous. It would force pro-
viders to violate their professional and
ethical standards regarding their obli-
gation to give patients full and accu-
rate information about their
healthcare and would discriminate
against providers who refuse to curtail
truthful communication with their pa-
tients. This rule would cut investments
in family planning clinics, taking away
services that so many people depend
on, with a disproportionate effect on
low-income families and those who al-
ready struggle to access care. This ef-
fort is part of the shameless and bla-
tantly political attempts from this ad-
ministration to restrict access to
healthcare.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1816 March 13, 2019
By attacking providers, such as
Planned Parenthood, the Trump ad-
ministration is once again threatening
the health and economic well-being of
millions. Women in New Hampshire
and across the country deserve better.
They should have the right to make
their own choice about if or when to
start a family, and they should be able
to visit providers of their choice who
understand their healthcare needs and
will be truthful about their healthcare
options and realities. This title X gag
rule undermines all of that.
I am going to continue to stand up
for a woman’s constitutionally pro-
tected rights, and I will do everything
I can to fight back against these par-
tisan attempts from the Trump admin-
istration to undermine women’s repro-
ductive healthcare.
Thank you.
NOMINATION OF NEOMI J. RAO
Mr. President, I also want to take a
moment to express my opposition to a
nominee the Senate is considering
today for the DC Circuit Court of Ap-
peals—Neomi Rao.
Ms. Rao is up for a lifetime appoint-
ment on the DC Circuit, but her record
and previous statements make it clear
that she is unfit for this position.
Ms. Rao’s writings as a college stu-
dent are nothing short of outrageous.
Ms. Rao once described race as a ‘‘hot
money-making issue.’’ She has called
the fight for LGBTQ equality a ‘‘trendy
political movement.’’ She has criti-
cized the ‘‘dangerous feminist idealism
which teaches women that they are
equal.’’ Perhaps most disturbing are
Ms. Rao’s previous writings on campus
sexual assault and rape. Ms. Rao once
claimed that women shared the respon-
sibility for being raped, saying: ‘‘If she
drinks to the point where she can no
longer choose, well, getting to that
point was part of her choice.’’ She also
noted that ‘‘a good way to prevent po-
tential date rape is to stay reasonably
sober.’’
I know that Ms. Rao has said she re-
gretted these comments now that she
is up for this appointment, but that
cannot make up for the type of damage
that rhetoric like this has done. In
2019, survivors are still not listened to
and taken seriously, and dangerous
rhetoric and callous beliefs like these
have prevented women from coming
forward with their experiences of sex-
ual assault in the first place.
I cannot support a nominee who
made a decision to publish these types
of outrageous sentiments.
If Ms. Rao’s previous statements
aren’t already disqualifying, then her
record as a member of the Trump ad-
ministration certainly is.
As the head of the Office of Informa-
tion and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, Ms.
Rao signed off on a policy that would
allow the Environmental Protection
Agency to not use the best available
evidence when developing clean air and
clean water protections—a policy with
dangerous implications given the fact
that the Trump administration has ig-
nored science and fought to undermine
these protections. Ms. Rao signed off
on this policy even after publicly
pledging to meet in a Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs sub-
committee hearing that she would do
just the opposite.
Additionally, one of Ms. Rao’s first
efforts in the Trump administration
was approving an effort to eliminate
reporting requirements proposed by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission to identify wage discrimina-
tion with regard to race and gender.
Finally, Ms. Rao approved of the title
X gag rule, which, as I just discussed,
will harm the health and well-being of
people across the country.
It is clear that Ms. Rao is a partisan
nominee with a dangerous record.
By the way, she has never tried a
case—not in Federal court and not in
State court.
Given her past comments, her record
in the Trump administration, and her
complete lack of experience, it is clear
that she does not meet the standard
that a lifetime appointment to a vital
court requires. I will oppose her nomi-
nation today, and I urge my colleagues
to do the same thing.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I would
like to start by talking about one of
the best things we are known for in
Montana, and that is our great out-
doors, whether it be our national
parks, our iconic wildlife, hunting, or
fly fishing. Like all Montanans, I want
the peace of mind that I can continue
to enjoy these opportunities with my
kids and grandkids, just as my dad and
my grandpa did with me growing up in
Montana.
In Montana, we know how to foster
commonsense, locally driven conserva-
tion to protect our environment. I am
here to tell you today that there is
nothing common sense about the so-
called Green New Deal. In fact, the
Green New Deal is a representation of
everything that is wrong with Wash-
ington, DC. It is a radical, top-down
idea that disregards the impacts on
hard-working Montanans and Ameri-
cans across our country.
You see, in Montana, we rely on a di-
verse portfolio of energy and fuel
sources to help grow our economy, to
create good-paying jobs, and to pre-
serve our Montana way of life. In order
to live where you also like to play—
that is what we call Montana—you
need a good-paying job. Montana is
still a State where a mom or a dad, a
grandma or a grandpa, or an uncle or
an aunt can take a child down to
Walmart and buy an elk tag over the
counter and be at a trailhead to start
elk hunting within 30 minutes. We need
our ag production. We need clean coal.
We need sustainable timber production.
These are all part of our Montana way
of life. They are all important to the
great State heritage we have. This
Green New Deal would uproot all of
that.
This Green New Deal sounds more
like a socialist wish list than it does
some great, bold conservation plan.
Calling for an end to air travel, getting
rid of all of the cows, and ceasing all
production of coal would literally de-
stroy our State’s economy. The Green
New Deal flat out doesn’t work. Mon-
tana’s rural communities would be left
without any power or electricity. In
fact, just this month, we saw record
cold temperatures in Montana. I was
trying to fly back to Washington, DC,
a week ago Monday. When I got to our
airport there in Bozeman, it was
minus-40 degrees. We had to hold the
plane for nearly 3 hours because deic-
ing fluid only works at minus-25 and
warmer temperatures.
The data that we have now looked at
from during that cold snap shows that
it was coal-fired generation—in par-
ticular, our Colstrip powerplant—that
picked up the slack during those low
temperatures. It kept the heat on for
families across Montana.
Our wind turbines have difficulty
working in subzero temperatures, and
that is regardless of whether the wind
blows. One of the challenges in a State
like Montana is that when a high-pres-
sure system moves in, whether in the
wintertime or in the summertime—
let’s take the winter for example. When
high pressure moves in, oftentimes
that is associated with low tempera-
tures. That usually is when we have a
spike in requirements of energy con-
sumption needs on the grid. What hap-
pens when a high-pressure system
moves in is that the wind stops blow-
ing. There is a reason wind is referred
to as intermittent energy.
I am not opposed to the renewables. I
think it is wonderful that we have wind
energy in Montana. We have solar. We
have hydro. We have a great renewable
energy portfolio in Montana. But the
reality is that during the coldest days
of the winter, the wind doesn’t blow. In
fact, at minus-23 degrees and colder,
they have to shut off the wind turbines
because of the stress it presents to the
materials of the turbines.
In the summertime, when high-pres-
sure systems move in, the tempera-
tures spike on the high side, and the
wind stops blowing. At the same time,
we have peak load on the grid.
So the commonsense thing to do is to
focus on accelerating development of
clean coal technology and keeping a
balanced portfolio to make sure we
meet the spike demands, whether they
are in the summertime or in the win-
tertime.
While we should focus on accel-
erating investments to help renewables
like wind become more reliable, which
makes a lot of sense, we should con-
tinue to think about how to make re-
newables better.
The Green New Deal seems to think
we all live in a fantasyland. In fact, it
states how the United States has a dis-
proportionate contribution to global

greenhouse gas emissions. Reports
show that it is Asia, China, India, and
other Asian countries. They are the
countries that will drive energy con-
sumption 25 percent higher by 2040 and
with it, global gas emissions.
The Green New Deal doesn’t tell the
positive story right here at home that
the U.S.—and listen to this—is actu-
ally a world leader in technological en-
ergy innovation; that is we, the United
States, leads the world in reducing en-
ergy-related carbon emissions. In fact,
since 2007, our emissions have de-
creased about 14 percent. In fact, it is
more innovation, not more regulation,
that will further reduce global carbon
emissions.
Our world is a safer, more secure
place if we accelerate energy innova-
tion here at home, not cut the rug out
from under us and cede that leadership
to Asian countries. To top it all off,
under the Green New Deal, it is the
American people and it is Montanans,
the hard-working taxpayers, who are
going to pick up the bill.
Some estimates have found this rad-
ical proposal would cost hard-working
families over $600,000 per household
over the proposed timeframe of that
deal. That is about $65,000 every year.
After only 10 years of implementa-
tion, Montanans will be stuck with a
$93 trillion tab; roughly, $10 trillion
more than the combined GDP of every
nation on the planet in 2017. You see,
this Green New Deal has nothing to do
with conservation and the environ-
ment.
The people of Montana believe in
smart and efficient conservation. Lis-
ten, I am an avid backpacker. I am an
avid fly fisherman. I spend more time
in the wilderness than many. My wife
and I love to put backpacks on and get
back in the High Country and chase
golden trout, the elk, and cattle. I love
pristine environments. Montanans
share a similar passion for the out-
doors, but Montanans know we need
smart and efficient conservation, and
there is not one smart or efficient
thing about this proposal.
The Green New Deal is not a bold
step forward. It is tragically backward.
This is taking us back to Lewis and
Clark, but don’t take it from me. Take
it from the hard-working Montanans,
like our mine workers, like our pipe
fitters, like our labor unions, which
say:
We will not accept proposals that could
cause immediate harm to millions of our
members and their families. We will not
stand by and allow threats to our members’
jobs and their families’ standard of living go
unanswered.
That is why I am here today. We will
not let this Green New Deal proposal
go unanswered.
WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAMS
Mr. President, our Nation’s primary
welfare-to-work program is broken.
The Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families Program, also called TANF,
was created with bipartisan support in
1996. It was recently reauthorized tem-
porarily, but I believe we need to take
bold action to reform it for today’s
generation.
TANF recognizes that funding and
maintaining a job is the most effective
way for healthy, working-age parents
to go from government dependency to
self-sufficiency. It is not about hand-
outs. It is about giving a hand to those
who need help the most.
Now, the more liberal voices of the
times argue that TANF Programs
wouldn’t work. In fact, it was our
former colleague, Senator Daniel Pat-
rick Moynihan, who predicted that
TANF would result in ‘‘children sleep-
ing on grates, picked up in the morning
frozen.’’
The critics were wrong. They were
very wrong. TANF was a huge success.
After TANF became law, welfare case-
loads plummeted, child poverty de-
clined, and unemployment among low-
income, never married parents went
up.
Yet more than 20 years after the his-
toric 1996 reforms, Congress has ne-
glected to act on the loopholes that are
undercutting its fundamental work re-
quirements.
Today, very few States are meeting
the work participation rate required by
the law. In fact, my home State of
Montana is one of many that is falling
short. You see, the law calls for 50 per-
cent of welfare enrollees to be engaged
in work. In Montana, they are only
reaching about one-third.
Many States are also using TANF
dollars for purposes unrelated to work,
and we need to hold those States ac-
countable. That means more trans-
parency and accountability metrics.
As we have seen in President
Trump’s recent budget proposal, the
President agrees that stronger work re-
quirements must be a priority of this
Congress. We can take the next bold
step forward in reforming the TANF
system to close these loopholes and get
the American people back to work.
We are fortunate our economy con-
tinues to grow, and there are more op-
portunities being created. Just last
Congress, we passed tax relief for the
American people so working-class fam-
ilies got to keep more of what they
earned and small business owners could
afford to invest and grow in their busi-
ness, creating more jobs. Main Street
in America is thriving again.
As employers are rapidly looking to
hire, we need to close the gap and en-
sure those jobs are filled by Americans
who need them most. A strong, revital-
ized TANF Program is urgently needed
to close this jobs gap and empower
more Americans to find work.
We have a problem in this economy
now. In fact, there are too many jobs
available and not enough people to fill
the jobs. That is a wonderful challenge
to face. We have seen that now for 10
consecutive months. That is a great
problem to face now in our country,
but it is still a problem we need to
solve. That is why we will be joining
the U.S. House Ways and Means Com-
mittee this week to introduce the
JOBS Act to demand positive work
outcomes, rather than simply meeting
ineffective participation rules.
It engages with every work-eligible
individual to develop a plan that can
lead to a sustainable career. It holds
States accountable for their work out-
comes and bolsters transparency of
every State’s performance.
The JOBS Act doesn’t just demand
work. It enables work. It substantially
increases funding for vital childcare
services so parents can ensure their
child is cared for when they are trying
to provide for their families.
It provides struggling beneficiaries
with additional time to get the mental
health or substance abuse treatment
they need before they can hold a job.
It adds apprenticeships as a permis-
sible work activity, alongside job
training, getting more education, and
building job readiness skills. It targets
funds to truly needy families by cap-
ping participation to families with in-
comes below 200 percent of the Federal
poverty level.
The JOBS Act recognizes there is
dignity in work. A job, to most Ameri-
cans, is more than just a job. It is an
opportunity for mobility. It is a step
up toward realizing the American
dream. It is a track toward earning
higher wages and better benefits. It can
be a springboard to a meaningful ca-
reer, and more importantly, it is hope
for those who know hard times all too
well. The dignity work brings can pro-
vide this hope.
The JOBS Act equips and empowers
low-income families toward a better fu-
ture. I urge my colleagues, Republicans
and Democrats, to join me in taking
bold action by supporting this impor-
tant legislation to make our largest
welfare-to-work program actually work
again.
I yield the floor.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise today in opposition to the nomina-
tion of Neomi Rao to the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.
The DC Circuit is considered by
many to be the most powerful appel-
late court in the country. This is true
in large part because the DC Circuit
hears challenges to many actions
taken by the Federal Government, in-
cluding challenges to the adoption or
repeal of Federal regulations.
I believe it is particularly relevant
that Ms. Rao has a record of working
to dismantle key regulations that en-
sure the air we breathe is safe, that ad-
dress climate change, and that protect
American workers and consumers.
Ms. Rao has a troubling and aggres-
sive record as the head of the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs.
She has led efforts to weaken fuel econ-
omy, or CAFE standards, which I au-
thored with Senator Olympia Snowe
and which has been the law since 2007.
Before the administration proposed
freezing these standards, we were set to
achieve a fuel economy standard of 54
miles per gallon—MPG—by 2025.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1818 March 13, 2019
Ms. Rao has also led efforts to repeal
the Clean Power Plan. This repeal has
been estimated to result in up to 1,400
premature deaths annually by 2030, due
to an increase in particulate matter
from emissions that are linked to heart
and lung disease. Further, the repeal of
the Clean Power Plan is expected to
cause up to 48,000 new cases of serious
asthma and 15,000 new cases of upper
respiratory problems every year.
Ms. Rao was also instrumental in re-
versing the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission’s actions to address
pay discrimination. Specifically, Ms.
Rao eliminated reporting requirements
proposed by the EEOC that were de-
signed to identify wage discrimination
on the basis of gender or race. Just last
week, a Federal judge ruled that Ms.
Rao’s action was ‘‘arbitrary and capri-
cious,’’ which is significant because the
arbitrary and capricious standard is
high and hard to prove. The judge con-
cluded that Ms. Rao’s rationale for her
decision was ‘‘unsupported by any
analysis.’’
Ms. Rao also approved the recently
finalized title X ‘‘gag rule’’ on family
planning. Under this rule, any organi-
zation that merely refers patients to
an abortion provider is ineligible for
title X funding. This will result in
many women going without lifesaving
cancer screenings, and it will reduce
access to contraception.
I asked Ms. Rao about her work dis-
mantling these key regulations. In re-
sponse to me, she downplayed her re-
sponsibility, saying that her role was
simply to ‘‘coordinate regulatory pol-
icy.’’
But when answering the questions of
Republican Senators, Ms. Rao ex-
pressed pride in her work. Asked spe-
cifically about her ‘‘primary contribu-
tion to pushing forward with deregula-
tion,’’ Ms. Rao responded: ‘‘There are a
lot of regulations on the books that
don’t have the effects that were in-
tended . . . . And, you know, we’re
looking to pull back the things that
are no longer working.’’
However, to take just one example,
the CAFE standards have been work-
ing; they have already saved $65 billion
in fuel costs for American families and
prevented the emission of 250 million
metric tons of carbon dioxide. Unfortu-
nately, her words don’t match the ac-
tual actions under her leadership.
Moreover, I asked Ms. Rao if she
would commit to recusing herself from
any case involving regulations that she
worked on while serving in her current
position. She refused to make such a
commitment.
This is of great concern as other
nominees have understood the appear-
ance of bias and unequivocally made
such commitments.
For example, President Trump’s first
nominee to the DC Circuit, Greg
Katsas, said, ‘‘Under the governing
statute, I would have to recuse myself
from any case in which, while in the
Executive Branch, I had participated as
a counsel or advisor or expressed an
opinion on the merits.’’
In addition to her record of disman-
tling key regulations that protect the
environment, consumers, and worker
health and safety, Ms. Rao has taken a
number of extremely controversial po-
sitions in articles she has written. At
Ms. Rao’s hearing before the Judiciary
Committee, I noted that, while the
writings that received the most atten-
tion are from when she was in college,
several are relevant to the work she
has led in the Trump administration
and to cases she could hear if con-
firmed.
For instance, in addressing the issue
of date rape, Ms. Rao wrote that if a
woman ‘‘drinks to the point where she
can no longer choose, well, getting to
that point was part of her choice.’’
While she has since written a letter
expressing that she ‘‘lacked the per-
spective of how [her articles] might be
perceived by others,’’ her record dem-
onstrates that these views seem to per-
sist to today. Specifically, Ms. Rao has
been personally involved in repealing
protections for survivors of campus
sexual violence. Ms. Rao has acknowl-
edged that her office approved con-
troversial new rules on campus sexual
assault under title IX. Those rules
would discourage survivors from re-
porting their assaults, in part because
survivors would be subjected to cross-
examination by their attacker’s chosen
representative. It is safe to assume this
change in the guidance will be chal-
lenged in the DC Circuit.
In her writings, Ms. Rao also ques-
tioned the validity of climate change,
criticizing certain student groups for
promoting ‘‘a dangerous orthodoxy
that includes the unquestioning ac-
ceptance of controversial theories like
the greenhouse effect,’’ which she ar-
gued ‘‘have come under serious sci-
entific attack.’’
Again, at the hearing, she tried to
mitigate these writings saying, it was
her ‘‘understanding . . . that human
activity does contribute to climate
change.’’
However, during her tenure in the
Trump administration, she has led the
effort to overturn the very regulations
that combat human contributions to
climate change. For example, and as I
noted previously, she has overseen the
administration’s efforts to rescind the
Clean Power Plan and weaken fuel
economy standards.
I am also concerned about Ms. Rao’s
professional experience. She is not ad-
mitted to practice before the DC Cir-
cuit, the court to which she has been
nominated. She has never served as a
judge, and she has never even tried a
case.
In response to a question on the Judi-
ciary Committee’s questionnaire about
the 10 most significant litigated mat-
ters that she personally handled, Ms.
Rao listed only three, and two of these
were arbitration cases that she worked
on while serving as an attorney in the
United Kingdom.
Ms. Rao’s lack of litigation experi-
ence therefore raises an important
question as to her qualifications for
this seat and suggests that she was
nominated not because of her appellate
credentials, but because of her anti-
regulatory record.
I also have questions about commit-
ments Ms. Rao appears to have made
on reproductive rights. I don’t believe
we should have litmus tests for judicial
nominees, and I know many on the
other side agree with me on that. Just
in 2017, Senator MCCONNELL said, ‘‘I
don’t think there should be a litmus
test on judges no matter who the presi-
dent is.’’
Yet, on a recent radio program, Sen-
ator HAWLEY said that, before he could
vote for Ms. Rao, he wanted to ‘‘make
sure that Neomi Rao is pro-life. It’s as
simple as that.’’
Subsequently, Ms. Rao met with Sen-
ator HAWLEY in private and presum-
ably assured him that she would be
anti-choice. According to Senator
HAWLEY, Ms. Rao went further and
‘‘emphasized that substantive due proc-
ess finds no textual support in the Con-
stitution.’’
Rejecting the entire concept of sub-
stantive due process means that Ms.
Rao not only believes Roe v. Wade was
incorrectly decided, but also other
landmark cases, like Griswold v. Con-
necticut, which held that States can-
not restrict the use of contraception.
I am also concerned about her writ-
ten responses to our questions for the
record. She gave several responses that
were misleading at best.
Ms. Rao wrote that the center she
founded at George Mason University
‘‘did not receive any money from the
Koch Foundation.’’ She added that the
center ‘‘did not receive money from an
anonymous donor.’’
However, according to public records,
in 2016, George Mason University re-
ceived $10 million from the Koch Foun-
dation and $20 million from an anony-
mous donor. The grant agreements exe-
cuting these donations clearly state
that support for Ms. Rao’s center was
one of the conditions of these multi-
million dollar gifts and ‘‘Ms. Rao’s cen-
ter benefited from those contribu-
tions.’’
Additionally, Senator WHITEHOUSE
asked Ms. Rao if she had any contact
with the Federalist Society when con-
sidering potential faculty. Ms. Rao re-
sponded ‘‘no,’’ but clarified the Fed-
eralist Society occasionally made rec-
ommendations through its faculty divi-
sion.
What Ms. Rao failed to mention is
that she, herself, was a member of the
faculty division of the Federalist Soci-
ety for her entire time in academia.
Given this role, I don’t understand why
she would claim that she had no con-
tact with the Federalist Society when
considering faculty candidates.
In closing, my concerns about Ms.
Rao, from her writings to her work dis-
mantling regulations to her lack of
candor with the committee, are simply
too great for me to support her nomi-
nation to the DC Circuit. I will vote

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1819
March 13, 2019
against her confirmation, and I urge
my colleagues to do the same.
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise
to speak in opposition to the nomina-
tion of Neomi Rao to serve as a judge
on the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Ms. Rao is the latest in a string of
ultra-conservative judicial nominees
who will rubberstamp Donald Trump’s
far-right agenda. Her record portends a
threat to the rights of women and mi-
norities, to consumer protection stat-
utes and regulations, and to the secu-
rity of our financial institutions.
Moreover, Ms. Rao utterly lacks the
experience to serve on the court that
many view as second in importance
only to the U.S. Supreme Court. She
practiced for only 3 years as an asso-
ciate at a large law firm. None of her
practice was in Federal courts or State
courts, before administrative agencies,
or involved criminal proceedings.
These are disqualifying reasons on
their own, but I rise to speak about Ms.
Rao’s record on the environment, and
the contempt she has demonstrated for
fair, reasonable, and commonsense reg-
ulations that protect the health of our
communities and the safety of our air
and drinking water.
Ms. Rao currently serves in the Of-
fice of Management and Budget as Ad-
ministrator of the Office of Informa-
tion and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA. She
is commonly known as the Trump ad-
ministration’s ‘‘regulatory czar.’’ This
role has her in charge of implementing
the Trump administration’s anti-envi-
ronment, climate-change-denying, and
polluter-friendly agenda.
Ms. Rao has called climate change a
‘‘dangerous orthodoxy,’’ led the Trump
administration’s efforts to gut funda-
mental environmental protections, and
has misused the regulatory review
process for partisan political purposes.
The attacks on the environment that
Ms. Rao has launched from OIRA in-
clude rolling back national auto fuel
efficiency standards, challenging Cali-
fornia’s Clean Air Act waiver that al-
lowed it to set higher fuel efficiency
standards, removing safety rules for
fertilizer plants, and rolling back safe-
ty rules put in place for oil rigs after
the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster
in 2010.
During review of a proposed rollback
of the Methane and Waste Prevention
Rule, Ms. Rao’s office repeatedly pres-
sured the Environmental Protection
Agency, EPA, to adopt fossil fuel in-
dustry requests to significantly reduce
natural gas leak inspections. This
would have doubled the amount of
methane released into the atmosphere
and, according to the EPA’s own deter-
mination, conflicted with its legal obli-
gation to reduce emissions.
Ms. Rao’s office censored language
about the impact of climate change on
child health when reviewing a proposed
rollback of the Refrigerant Manage-
ment Program, a program that limited
the release of greenhouse gases thou-
sands of times more powerful that car-
bon dioxide.
Ms. Rao’s office approved a proposed
EPA rule to roll back public health
protections that reduce pollution from
wood-burning stoves, despite the EPA’s
own admission that the new rule would
cost nine times as much in harm to
public health as it would benefit the in-
dustry.
Ms. Rao has overseen the Trump ad-
ministration’s repeal of regulations to
address climate change, including a re-
peal of President Obama’s historic
Clean Power Plan that would have sig-
nificantly reduced greenhouse gas
emissions. By comparison, Ms. Rao has
approved a proposal to replace the
Clean Power Plan with a rule that
would lead to increases in carbon diox-
ide emissions, asthma attacks, and
even death from black carbon, mer-
cury, and other dangerous air emis-
sions from power plants.
It is bad enough that, with Donald
Trump, we have a climate-change de-
nier in the White House, and with An-
drew Wheeler, we have a coal industry
lobbyist running the EPA. We don’t
need a judge on the DC Circuit whose
record demonstrates that she is a sym-
pathetic ally to their anti-environment
agenda. I urge my colleagues to vote no
on the nomination of Neomi Rao to the
DC Circuit Court of Appeals.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PERDUE). The clerk will report the
nomination.
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of William Beach, of Kansas, to
be Commissioner of Labor Statistics,
Department of Labor, for a term of
four years.
NOMINATION OF WILLIAM BEACH
Mr. BLUNT. I want to talk a little
about the Green New Deal, but I can’t
pass up the opportunity to point out
that we are now starting 30 hours of de-
bate on the Director of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
It is outrageous. Everybody knows it
is outrageous. If you start the clock
right now, there will not be an hour of
debate—there might not be 10 minutes
of debate—on the Director of the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics, but what our
friends on the other side have done is
ensure that we can’t do any other busi-
ness during that 30 hours, and, at some
point, once it is too late to do anything
else this week, they may even waive
some of that time back.
This has to change. I certainly would
like to see Members on the other side
of the aisle work with us to make that
change. The bill I have reported out of
the Rules Committee that we have re-
ported out of our committee to change
this is given more verification every
single week, as we try to let the Presi-
dent put a government in place, as we
try to do our job of confirming judges
to judicial vacancies. That has to stop,
and I believe it is about to stop. I
would like to see some cooperation
from our friends on the other side so
we can move forward in the way the
Senate should move forward.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. President, the Senate has also
been talking about legislation called
the Green New Deal. A dozen of our
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
have put this legislation in place. When
you sponsor a piece of legislation, it
usually means you are for that piece of
legislation and think it needs to be de-
bated, and it sure does.
This is a huge piece of legislation.
Anything called the green anything
would mean you would think it would
be mostly about climate change or en-
vironmental things, but actually most
of it is about other things. I want to
talk for a few minutes about what it
says about healthcare.
It is estimated that one part of the
Green New Deal would cost $36 trillion
over the next 10 years. That is about
the same amount of money we would
spend for everything else over the next
10 years of the money we appropriate.
It is such a big number; it is hard to
imagine how you would even describe
it, but $36 billion would be 100 times
what it would cost to rebuild the entire
Interstate Highway System. If you can
imagine the entire Interstate Highway
System, and you wanted to build it all
over again—build it again, go in and
tear it up, and build it again—do that
100 times over the next 100 years or
however many years it would take,
that is $36 trillion. I might have even
said earlier $36 billion, but it is $36 tril-
lion, 100 times what it would cost to
build the entire Interstate Highway
System all over again.
It is an absolutely enormous figure,
but the government is accepting an ab-
solutely enormous new obligation, an
obligation that, just in terms of the
healthcare part of this bill, would
again be more than all the money we
would expect to spend over the next 7
years.
That would take us through fiscal
year 2025. Everything we would spend
on Social Security, everything we
would spend on Medicare, everything
we would spend on Medicaid, every-
thing we would spend on defense, on
education, on homeland security, on
interest on the debt, and everything
else would be less money than we
would spend in the first decade on
Medicare for All.
If you look at this legislation, it is
pretty obvious that Medicare for All
would, for a lot of reasons, be Medicare
for None. One is that big of a system
probably wouldn’t serve anybody very
well, if at all. Two is that Medicare
would be eliminated. It would just be
part of a big healthcare system. If you
are planning on benefiting from Medi-
care as we know it today, that will not
be there if this bill passed because ev-
erybody would have something that
would be theoretically like Medicare is
now, but there wouldn’t be Medicare;
there wouldn’t be Medicaid; there
wouldn’t be military TRICARE; there
wouldn’t be the Children’s Health In-
surance Program. None of the things
we have now would exist. They would
all become part of this big system of
Medicare for All.
In fact, it actually would eliminate
private health insurance. We are in
this debate way beyond the debate of
the days of when President Obama said
over and over again, if you like your
current healthcare insurance, you can
keep your current healthcare insur-
ance. Nobody even pretends with Medi-
care for All that would be the case. In
fact, this legislation specifically says:
‘‘It is unlawful for a private health in-
surer to sell health insurance coverage
that duplicates the benefits provided
under this Act.’’ You will have no
choice but to look at Medicare for All.
So when they say Medicare for All,
they really mean Medicare for All. The
other forms of healthcare coverage
would be gone.
One of our colleagues who is also run-
ning for President said: ‘‘Let’s elimi-
nate all of that.’’ ‘‘That’’ in the ques-
tion was private health insurance.
‘‘Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move
on.’’
Well, what moving on would look
like would be everybody, again, thrown
into one system. There would be a sin-
gle-payer, the Federal Government.
There would be a single system. You
could call it Medicare for All or any-
thing else you want to call it, but there
would be one place to go.
We are now spending about $6 trillion
over the next 10 years on Federal
healthcare systems. This would go
from $6 trillion to $36 trillion.
I could spend a lot of time talking
about, how could we afford that? What
would the taxes look like? The point is,
it is an outrageous proposal, particu-
larly for the millions and millions of
Americans who like the insurance they
have, who get insurance at work. It has
been a benefit in our country that
workers first started getting right
after World War II. It has been a ben-
efit at work that workers have never
paid taxes on. It has been a benefit at
work that an awful lot of people have
been well served by.
We need to fill in the gaps. We need
to create more options. We need to do
lots of things. This isn’t one of them.
When people lose their healthcare op-
tions, when people begin to have to
stand in line for healthcare like people
do in Canada, they are quickly per-
suaded that, whatever turn was made,
it was made in the wrong direction.
This would be a turn in the wrong di-
rection. It would be something the gov-
ernment can’t afford and individuals
and families will not want. It would be
something that people who have actu-
ally depended on Medicare being there
when they qualify for Medicare—and
people pay into it all their working
lives, just like they do into Social Se-
curity, except there is no cap, so many
people pay a lot more into that fund
than they do the Social Security
fund—but it would be gone. Medicare
for All would be Medicare for None.
I think there is a reason sponsors of
this bill aren’t eager to talk about a
lot of it and don’t even want to vote on
it. If I had sponsored it, I might not
want to vote on it either.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1821
March 13, 2019
by Jill Lepore. It is a history of the
United States. She is a really gifted
historian and writes quite a few things.
She has an article in the New Yorker
magazine about Eugene V. Debs, an
early Socialist in the 20th century who
ran for President. She is a skillful his-
torian, and she tells a story in ‘‘These
Truths’’ about how this Nation came to
be.
Of course, we emerged from a col-
ony—a colony of England, Great Brit-
ain—and then fought for our independ-
ence. One of the reasons we fought for
independence was to take the role of
Kings out of the lives of the people who
lived in what we call America and to
say we aren’t going to have Kings mak-
ing decisions for us here. We will make
our own decisions. Thank you. We will
call it a democracy, and the people will
rule.
At that point, we sat down and tried
to put it in writing. The first time we
put it in writing, it didn’t work out too
well. The Articles of Confederation
really didn’t unite our country and
move it in the direction that most peo-
ple wanted. So the constitutional con-
vention followed. The constitutional
convention in Philadelphia sat down
and wrote this document, the Constitu-
tion of the United States, and here we
are, over 200 years later, still living by
those words that were written over 200
years ago.
There were efforts to change and
amend it to reflect changes in Amer-
ica. The end of slavery, for example,
was one of the most significant, but, by
and large, the principles of this docu-
ment have guided us for a long time.
Article I, section 8 gives the Con-
gress—the Senate and the House—the
power to declare war. You think to
yourself: Well, it is certainly better for
the Congress to make that decision
than for a President to do it alone. Let-
ting a President do it without the peo-
ple being involved, or Congress, really
would be much like a King deciding
whether we would go forward as a na-
tion to be involved in a war.
This week, on the floor of the Senate,
we will test that provision in the Con-
stitution and see if the current Mem-
bers of the Senate believe that the Con-
stitution was right and that the Con-
gress should be declaring war.
My colleagues, BERNIE SANDERS,
well-known to most across America,
MIKE LEE, a conservative Republican
from Utah, and CHRIS MURPHY, a Dem-
ocrat from Connecticut, have decided
that we should have a test vote as to
the United States’ involvement in
Saudi Arabia’s bloody war in Yemen. I
am glad to be a cosponsor of that legis-
lation.
Regardless of who has been in the
White House during the time that I
have served in the House and the Sen-
ate, I have tried to consistently argue
that the American people, through
their elected Congress, must play a
constitutional role in declaring a war—
whether it was President Bush on the
Iraq war or President Obama on the
U.S. military intervention in Syria or
Libya.
I think the Constitution is very clear
and very wise in saying that the Amer-
ican people, before we ask their sons
and daughters to give up their lives in
a war, should have a say in these deci-
sions through their elected Members of
Congress.
What we are doing today is deeply
important. It occurs in the 18th year of
a war in Afghanistan that hardly any-
one could have imagined would be the
case. Did anyone here who voted, as I
did, 18 years ago—18 years ago, voting
in this Chamber—for the authorization
of the use of force in Afghanistan to go
after the perpetrators of 9/11 believe
that we were authorizing the longest
war in the history of the United States,
in Afghanistan—I am sure not a one—
or that this authorization would be
stretched by Presidents of both polit-
ical parties to approve U.S. military
action in other countries around the
world? It became a blanket authoriza-
tion that has been used time and again.
This brings me to the question before
us in the Senate today—the disastrous,
bloody war, led by the Saudi Arabians
in Yemen, which the United States is
supporting.
Has there been a vote in the Senate
for that? No. In the House? No. Does
anyone here remember authorizing any
U.S. military involvement in the war
in Yemen? Well, they certainly
couldn’t find a recorded vote to prove
it.
Did anyone who voted in 2001, as I
did, to go after the terrorists respon-
sible for 9/11, believe that this would
somehow include a Saudi-led quagmire
in Yemen?
This war in Yemen is being led by a
reckless young Saudi Crown Prince,
whom I believe had direct involvement
in the brutal murder of a journalist
and resident of the United States,
Jamal Khashoggi. It is highly unlikely
that anybody would have argued that
we gave permission for the U.S. Mili-
tary and taxpayers’ dollars to be spent
in support of this Saudi Arabian cause.
Not only was this war never author-
ized by elected representatives or the
American people, but it is a humani-
tarian disaster. An estimated 85,000
children have already died of malnutri-
tion. We have created a famine with
this war in Yemen. In a country of 28
million people, nearly half face death
through famine.
I have a photo here, which I have dis-
played once on the floor, but I can’t
bring myself to do it again. It is a
photo of a 7-year-old Yemeni girl, Amal
Hussain. It is a heartbreaking photo. It
appeared in the New York Times last
November. This little girl died shortly
thereafter. She starved to death. I just
can’t bring myself to display this photo
again.
Do you know what her mother said
after she died? It is what any mother
would say: ‘‘My heart is broken.’’
This is a reality of the war that the
United States supports in Yemen. We
have not debated it. We have not ap-
proved it. Yet taxpayers’ dollars make
certain that it continues day after day,
week after week, month after month,
and year after year.
Now, let’s take a look at Saudi Ara-
bia, which has asked us to join in this
effort in Yemen that is causing such a
humanitarian disaster. This is the
same Saudi Arabia—the nation that
conducted the cold-blooded murder of
Jamal Khashoggi, a nation that is de-
taining and torturing women’s rights
activists, including Loujain al-Hathoul
and Samar Badawi. This is a nation
that is detaining and torturing U.S.
citizen Dr. Walid Fitaihi. It is jailing
Saudi blogger Raif Badawi and his law-
yer, Waleed Abu al-Khair, on charges
that are ridiculous on their face.
Saudi Arabia is accused of recruiting
and using Sudanese children as soldiers
in the war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia con-
tinues to turn a blind eye to the export
of extremist teachings that have shown
up and caused great harm around the
world, most recently in Bosnia and
Kosovo.
There may be some who think this
war is justified. I am not one of them.
There may be some who think that be-
cause Iran is the enemy, we should be
engaged in this war. But, ultimately,
this war, this debate, and this vote are
not about the merits of any of the
things that I have raised. It is not
about a vindication of the Houthis,
whom the Iranians have sided with,
and their troubling role in this horrific
civil war. It is about whether we in the
Senate, who took an oath to uphold
and defend the Constitution, believe it.
If we don’t believe it, we will just ig-
nore it, let our military wage the war,
let the President look the other way,
and let this administration come up
with another excuse for Saudi Arabia
killing that journalist, and we will
keep sending our tax dollars in, which
prolong this terrible war.
I think the Constitution requires
more of us. If you truly believe in what
the President is asking us to do in
Yemen, if you truly want to stand with
Saudi Arabia at this moment in his-
tory, show the courage by voting that
way. That is all I am asking for.
Our Founding Fathers showed great
wisdom. They knew that the decision
to send someone’s son or daughter into
a war was not to be made by a King or

THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I
come to the floor to discuss the so-
called Green New Deal.
America needs every form of energy
in order to succeed, but the Democrats’
extreme Green New Deal would send
our strong, healthy, and growing econ-
omy over a liberal cliff. This radical
plan would eliminate fossil fuels by re-
quiring 100-percent renewable, carbon-
free fuels in just 10 years.
Clearly, we realize that the climate
is changing and that the global com-
munity has a collective duty to deal
with this and to address it. Renewables
like wind and solar are certainly a key
part of the solution, but still, in the
United States today, wind and solar
provide only 8 percent of our power.
Abundant, reliable, and affordable fos-
sil fuels, like coal and natural gas,
power about three out of five U.S.
homes and businesses. Excluding them
would harm our national security; it
would make us dependent on foreign
energy; it would destroy jobs; and it
would reduce our quality of life.
In a letter sent to the Green New
Deal’s sponsors, the AFL–CIO—the Na-
tion’s federation of labor unions that
represents about 121⁄2 million employ-
ees and 55 different unions—called the
plan a threat to U.S. workers. The let-
ter reads: ‘‘We will not accept pro-
posals that could cause immediate
harm to millions of our members and
their families.’’
Those at the AFL–CIO also say the
plan is not achievable or realistic, and
I agree with them. By themselves, re-
newables can’t keep the lights on, and
an all-renewable energy electric power
grid would collapse. This isn’t serious
environmental policy—it is a pipe
dream.
The Democrats have yet to provide a
cost estimate for the Green New Deal.
One analysis by the former Director of
the Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates it could cost up to $93 trillion—
with a ‘‘t.’’ That is more than the U.S.
Government has spent in our Nation’s
entire history—combined. We are $22
trillion in debt right now. So how are
we going to pay for it—by borrowing
more money we don’t have or by hiking
taxes?
The crushing burden is going to fall
the hardest on working families. To get
to this number, it would drain every
person’s checkbook in America, start-
ing with Warren Buffett and going all
the way down. The Green New Deal
would cost every American family as
much as $65,000 a year every year. That
is more than the average family makes
in America. In Wyoming, where the av-
erage family’s income is way above av-
erage, it would cost the family $61,000 a
year.
Despite the heavy toll it would take,
the Green New Deal would still fail to
significantly lower the Earth’s tem-
perature. Already, America leads the
world in reducing carbon emissions. In
2017, the U.S. produced just 13 percent
of the global emissions, and China and
India combined produced 33 percent.
Let’s take a look at this from a glob-
al standpoint. To me, it doesn’t make
any sense at all to destroy our com-
petitive economy and allow the biggest
polluters to continue to prioritize
growth at our expense. Backbreaking
tax increases and heavyhanded man-
dates are not the answer. The solution
is to promote free market innovation,
and the Republicans continue to ad-
vance several innovative strategies for
reducing emissions.
First, we are encouraging carbon cap-
ture, utilization, and sequestration
technologies. That means actually cap-
turing carbon and using it productively
for medical products, for construction
products.
There are things we can actually do.
Last year, we passed a bipartisan bill
in this body that was signed into law.
It is called the FUTURE Act, and it ex-
pands tax credits for capturing carbon.
The Clean Air Task Force calls it one
of the most important bills for reduc-
ing global warming pollution in the
last two decades.
Our carbon capture work continues
with the bipartisan USE IT Act, which
is going to help turn captured emis-
sions into valuable products.
The other thing we are promoting is
advanced nuclear power technologies.
Nuclear power has helped lower emis-
sions by providing most of America’s
carbon-free energy.
In late December, we passed the bi-
partisan Nuclear Energy Innovation
and Modernization Act. This law will
help innovators develop new-age nu-
clear reactors that are cheaper, better,
and more reliable.
We also have extended the nuclear
tax credit to speed completion of two
new nuclear reactors. We are going to
speed that completion—the first in a
generation. Together they will prevent
10 million tons of emissions every year.
Third, we are encouraging an in-
crease in the use of renewables. Repub-
licans have repeatedly passed tax in-
centives to promote clean energy.
These include tax credits for wind,
for solar panels, as well as incentives
for biodiesel and compressed natural
gas. The clean energy strategies that
Republicans have been working on in a
bipartisan way are working because
America leads the world in reducing
energy-related emissions.
Since 2007, U.S. emissions have been
down 14 percent. This progress is the
result of innovation. So let’s continue
to promote proven solutions. Let’s re-
ject the Democrats’ Green New Deal as
unreasonable, unworkable, and
unaffordable.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, last
week, I joined several of my colleagues
to highlight the unrealistic and unrea-
sonable and impractical ideas of the
Green New Deal—the staggering cost,
which is more than the Federal Gov-
ernment has spent in our history; the
misguided assumptions about what it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1823
March 13, 2019
would take to decarbonize the U.S.
economy on such an aggressive
timeline; and the sorts of social pro-
grams that fundamentally change the
United States, and, I would add, not in
a good way, in my opinion.
But the worst part that has been
talked about is a point I made last
week. This resolution, this green deal
resolution, dismisses or ignores the re-
alistic and pragmatic environmental
solutions that this Congress and past
Congresses have already been working
on.
I serve on the Environment and Pub-
lic Works Committee with Chairman
BARRASSO, who just spoke, and we have
been working together in many dif-
ferent areas to get the same sorts of
ends.
The supporters of the Green New
Deal actually claim Congress has done
nothing. Unfortunately, some in the
media and some others seem to be reit-
erating that same message.
As in so many policy arenas, the lat-
est shiny object distracts from the
great bipartisan work that is being
done in these Halls—work that some-
times just doesn’t get noticed—and
that is exactly what is happening here.
Well, today I would like to highlight
some of the practical, realistic, bipar-
tisan efforts that will put us on the
right path without killing jobs or over-
burdening Americans with government
spending and higher costs.
Just yesterday, President Trump
signed into law the bipartisan lands
package we passed in the Senate last
month, and it was an overwhelming
vote. As part of that legislation, we
permanently reauthorized the Land
and Water Conservation Fund, which is
a critical resource for protecting and
preserving some of our country’s most
beautiful public lands, including those
in my State of West Virginia.
Another example of the legislative
solutions that we have advanced is the
FUTURE Act, which I led with my
Democratic colleagues, former Senator
Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota
and Senator WHITEHOUSE from Rhode
Island, along with Chairman BARRASSO.
That legislation had a bipartisan group
of 25 cosponsors and the support of an
incredibly diverse and broad coalition
of supporters: environmental groups,
oil and gas companies, Governors from
around the country, and labor unions.
What cause could bring these diverse
stakeholders together? Carbon capture
utilization and storage—CCUS.
The FUTURE Act reauthorized and
improved the section 45Q tax credit for
CCUS, and it requires the certainty
that the carbon stays captured for good
and is used in real products for market
potential.
It is not about research and develop-
ment. There are other Federal pro-
grams that are reserved for that impor-
tant endeavor. It is about establishing
real incentives for the commercial de-
ployment of CCUS technologies and es-
tablishing a national market for car-
bon.
Only a market-based solution like
the FUTURE Act can lead to broad
adoption of CCUS. And CCUS is some-
thing that the International Panel on
Climate Change at the U.N. and several
other climate and scientific organiza-
tions say must be a part of the inter-
national solution to this global chal-
lenge.
The FUTURE Act also includes sup-
port for direct-air capture projects, and
that means not just from a power
source or some other manufacturing
source. It is actually capturing it in
the free air in the environment, which
can literally pull CO2 out of the atmos-
phere for storage or use in marketable
products. That can work to make new
industries carbon-negative and carbon-
neutral.
The United States can be a leader in
this space because the environment is a
global concern, and we can’t control
other countries’ industrial and envi-
ronmental policies, nor do we want
them controlling ours.
With CCUS and direct-air capture,
not only can we cut our emissions
while maintaining high-paying coal,
gas, oil, and manufacturing jobs, but
we can also capture emissions emitted
abroad and use them in value-added
products.
The FUTURE Act was passed as part
of the bipartisan Budget Act last Con-
gress, and we are already seeing new
projects being proposed to benefit from
this policy. Even more will be coming
forward as we build on this success,
and that is where the USE IT Act
comes in.
We introduced that legislation with
the same group of cosponsors with En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee Ranking Member CARPER step-
ping in for Senator Heitkamp. We have
a similar coalition of supporters across
industry, environmental groups, State
governments, and labor.
The USE IT Act will direct an inter-
agency council to review the guidelines
and create a playbook for permitting
CCUS projects and associated carbon
dioxide pipelines. This certainty from
Federal Agencies is essential so that
those seeking to utilize the 45Q tax
credit that I talked about previously in
the FUTURE Act can do so before it
expires.
I look forward to advancing this leg-
islation in Congress. We have already
had a hearing on it—a very great bipar-
tisan hearing on this—and I look for-
ward to furthering our achievements in
the CCUS space.
The FUTURE Act also includes seed
money for breakthrough innovations in
carbon capture. This expands on the
good work that is already being done in
CCUS research and development, pri-
marily through the funding of the Fos-
sil Energy Research and Development
Office.
Congress has invested more than $4
billion in CCUS through that program
alone, in addition to several other pro-
grams to make more efficient and envi-
ronmentally sound use of our fossil re-
sources. Some of these breakthroughs
are being developed at the National En-
ergy Technology Lab in Morgantown,
WV, in conjunction with outside part-
ners like West Virginia University.
I will continue to advocate for this
kind of robust funding for these sorts
of innovative energy programs, and I
will support improving energy effi-
ciency and ensuring that the United
States remains a leader in carbon-free
nuclear energy.
Doing the hard-nosed legislating and
coalition building to achieve these
goals is tough enough without all of
the noise around a Green New Deal. De-
spite this distraction, I am confident
we can continue to notch wins in this
arena. We have to because there is sim-
ply too much riding on it for our econ-
omy and for our environment.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida.
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
when it comes to bankrupting our
country, the Green New Deal puts all
other ideas to shame. It calls for re-
building or retrofitting every building
in America in the next 10 years, elimi-
nating all fossil fuels in 10 years, elimi-
nating nuclear power, and working to-
ward ending air travel. This Green New
Deal is not a serious policy idea; it is a
unicorn.
Democrats failed to grasp something
basic: Republicans and Independents
care about the environment. We want
clean air, we want clean water, and we
want to take care of our environment
and natural resources. At the same
time, we also care about our economy,
jobs for families in our States, and
making sure that everyone in our
country has the opportunity to suc-
ceed. We believe that taking care of
the planet and working to create a bet-
ter economy are objectives that can
and must be pursued at the exact same
time.
You can’t afford to take care of the
environment if you don’t have a strong
economy. The Green New Deal would
destroy our economy. To embrace this
Green New Deal plan is to be an enemy
of the American economy and the
American worker because when you
stop and think about it, the Green New
Deal is, in reality, the green job killer.
Some will say: Why bother picking
on this plan? It is not like it has any
chance of being enacted.
Here is the problem: A socialist from
New York City with a massive Twitter
following introduced this nonserious
plan, and every single major Democrat
running for President immediately em-
braced it. Let that sink in for a mo-
ment.
Climate change is real and requires
real solutions, but the Democratic
Party has accepted this economy-de-
stroying new deal as a new command-
ment to go alongside single-payer
healthcare and higher taxes on job cre-
ators.
For most Americans, this plan is a
declaration of war on the economy, our

way of life, and the standard of living
for working class families across our
great country.
What does this mean for Florida?
Well, it would mean the end of the
tourism industry; that is, 1.4 million
jobs, massive job loss, and unemploy-
ment.
As for me, I love and cherish the en-
vironment. It is what makes the great
State of Florida so great. What I don’t
love are naive plans that would destroy
Florida’s economy.
During my time as Governor of Flor-
ida, we made record investments in our
environment, and we were able to do
that only because Florida’s economy
was booming and we had the resources
to make these investments. The Green
New Deal would reverse every ounce of
progress we have made.
The most incredible part of the Green
New Deal plan is the statement that
they will provide ‘‘economic security
for all people of the United States.’’ No
government can ever do that. To argue
otherwise is a disservice to all hard-
working Americans and nothing more
than phony political posturing.
I look forward to a time when we
don’t have to argue about ridiculous
proposals being amplified in the media
and can actually focus on real solu-
tions to protect our environment and
build our economy.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana.
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise
today to speak about the so-called
Green New Deal and its impact on Indi-
ana’s agricultural community and our
Hoosier farmers.
As I said last week, this misguided
Green New Deal is unaffordable, unat-
tainable, and unrealistic. In fact, over
the next decade, this so-called deal
would cost up to $65,000 per American
household per year.
This proposal is a job killer, and it is
bad news for hard-working Hoosiers.
This is especially true for Hoosiers who
rely on our vital agriculture industry
for their incomes.
Allow me to run through a few num-
bers. In Indiana, agriculture supports
more than 107,000 Hoosier jobs. Agri-
culture also contributes an estimated
$30 billion to Indiana’s economy. Indi-
ana is the 10th largest farming state in
the Nation, and we are the 8th largest
ag export. Perhaps most importantly,
97 percent of Hoosier farms are family
owned or operated.
Agriculture is a main driver of our
State’s economy. It is often said that
Indiana feeds the world, and we take a
lot of pride in that. We need our ag
community to continue thriving. Yet
the sponsors of this Green New Deal
have spoken about cutting back on the
farming practices that employ Hoosiers
and put food on the table.
Imagine the crushing cost to Hoosier
farmers of changing out all farm equip-
ment for electric vehicles or the cost of
upgrading every single building on
every farm in Indiana. This is on top of
the sharp climb in energy prices that
we would see under the Green New
Deal. This bad deal would force the
cost of doing business to skyrocket for
Hoosier manufacturers and our farm-
ers, which would mean higher prices
for consumers and less money in the
pockets of hard-working Hoosiers.
Jim, a small business owner from
Muncie, wrote to my office recently.
He said: ‘‘Please stop the Green New
Deal in its tracks NOW.’’
I also heard from Patrick in Bloom-
ington, who said: ‘‘As a man who has
served my country in combat in Viet-
nam 50 years ago and someone who
loves my country deeply—I am very
concerned about the direction our na-
tion is heading.’’ Regarding the Green
New Deal, he added: ‘‘I hope you won’t
give this idea a second thought.’’
Dennis from Greenwood wrote: ‘‘My
wife and I are strongly against the
‘Green New Deal’. . . . We would rec-
ommend that you not support this
crazy idea.’’
Well, Dennis, I don’t intend to.
Susan from Lafayette wrote: ‘‘Please
hold strong and promote the values of
Indiana and many Americans. . . . ’’
The bottom line is this: Hoosiers
don’t want this harmful Green New
Deal. It sets unattainable goals that
are bad for Hoosier farmers. It is bad
for our economy, and it is bad for our
families.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont.
S.J. RES. 7
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me
begin by thanking Senator MIKE LEE
and Senator CHRIS MURPHY for their
hard work on this important resolu-
tion—work which, in fact, has gone on
now for several years.
Today is an extremely important
day. Today we in the Senate have the
opportunity to take a major step for-
ward in ending the horrific war in
Yemen and alleviating the terrible,
terrible suffering being experienced by
the people in one of the poorest coun-
tries on Earth.
Today, equally important, we can fi-
nally begin the process of reasserting
Congress’s responsibility over war-
making. As every schoolchild should
know, article I of the Constitution
clearly states that it is Congress, not
the President, that has the power to
declare war. In their great wisdom, the
Framers of our Constitution, the
Founders of this country, gave that
enormously important responsibility
to Congress because the Members of
the House and the Senate are closer
and more accountable to the people of
this country.
Tragically, however, over many
years, Congress has abdicated that re-
sponsibility to Democratic Presidents
and Republican Presidents. Today we
begin the process of reclaiming our
constitutional authority by ending
U.S. involvement in a war that has not
been authorized by Congress and is
clearly unconstitutional.
Last December, this body made his-
tory for the first time since the War
Powers Resolution was passed in 1973.
A majority of Senators—56 of us, in a
bipartisan way—used those powers
from the War Powers Act to end U.S.
involvement in a war.
Today we consider that exact same
resolution once again in the new Con-
gress. This time, however, unlike last
session, this resolution will be brought
to the House floor, and I strongly be-
lieve will be passed.
Let me say a brief word about the
war in Yemen.
In March of 2015, under the leadership
of Muhammad bin Salman, then Saudi
Defense Minister and now the Crown
Prince, a Saudi-led coalition inter-
vened in Yemen’s ongoing civil war. As
a result of that intervention, Yemen is
now experiencing the worst humani-
tarian disaster on the planet.
According to the United Nations,
Yemen is at risk of the most severe
famine in 100 years, with some 14 mil-
lion people facing the possibility of
starvation. In one of the poorest coun-
tries on Earth, as a result of this war,
according to the Save the Children or-
ganization, some 85,000 children in
Yemen have already starved to death
over the last several years—an un-
imaginable number, unimaginable suf-
fering and destruction. If this war con-
tinues, what the experts tell us is that
millions more will also face famine and
starvation.
Further, Yemen is currently experi-
encing the worst cholera outbreak in
the world, with as many as 10,000 new
cases each week, according to the
World Health Organization. This is a
disease spread by infected water that
causes severe diarrhea and dehydration
and will only accelerate the death rate.
The cholera outbreak has occurred be-
cause Saudi bombs have destroyed
Yemen’s water infrastructure and peo-
ple are no longer able to access clean
drinking water.
The fact is that the United States,
with little media attention, has been
Saudi Arabia’s partner in this horrific
war. We have been providing the bombs
that the Saudi-led coalition is using.
We have been refueling their planes be-
fore they drop those bombs, and we
have been assisting with intelligence.
In too many cases, our weapons are
being used to kill civilians. In August,
it was an American-made bomb that
obliterated a schoolbus full of young
boys, killing dozens and wounding
many more. A CNN report found evi-
dence that American weapons have
been used in a string of such deadly at-
tacks on civilians since the war began.
This past weekend—this past week-
end—at least 20 women and a child
were killed in a Saudi-led airstrike on
Yemen’s northwestern Province of
Hajjah, as they huddled in a house to
avoid nearby clashes. As is so often the
case in war, the innocent, the women
and the children, pay the price.
Late last year, I met with several
brave Yemeni human rights activists.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1825
March 13, 2019
They had come to Congress to urge us
to put a stop to this war. They told me
clearly: When Yemenis see ‘‘Made in
America’’ on the bombs that are kill-
ing them, it tells them that the United
States is responsible for this war. That
is the sad truth.
The bottom line is that the United
States should not be supporting a cata-
strophic war led by a despotic regime
with a dangerous and irresponsible for-
eign policy.
Some have suggested that Congress
moving to withdraw support for this
war would undermine the United Na-
tions’ efforts to reach a peace agree-
ment, but the opposite is true. It is the
promise of unconditional U.S. support
for the Saudis that undermines those
efforts.
We have evidence of this. Last De-
cember, as we were preparing to vote
on this same resolution, we received
news that U.N. Special Envoy Martin
Griffiths reached a breakthrough
agreement for a ceasefire in the port
city of Hodeidah. That ceasefire, which
is being maintained today, is enabling
food and increased humanitarian aid
into the country.
I have spoken to people at the high-
est level of those negotiations, who
have made it clear that our actions
here in the Senate played a significant
role in pushing Saudi Arabia toward an
agreement. That pressure must con-
tinue, and the resolution I hope we
pass today will do just that.
Our effort on this issue has clearly
made a positive impact, and I thank all
of the cosponsors of this resolution for
their efforts and all of the civil society
organizations—progressive and con-
servative organizations—that have
worked so hard to raise awareness of
this conflict and the constitutional im-
plications.
Above and beyond the humanitarian
crisis in Yemen, this war has been
harmful to our national security and
the security of the region. The admin-
istration defends our engagement in
Yemen by overstating Iranian support
for the Houthi rebels. Let me be clear.
Iran’s support for the Houthis is of se-
rious concern for all of us, but the
truth is that support there is far less
significant than the administration
claims. The fact is that the relation-
ship between Iran and the Houthis has
only been strengthened by this war.
The war is creating the very problem
the administration claims to want to
solve.
This war is also undermining the
broader effort against violent extrem-
ists. A 2016 State Department report
found that the conflict had helped al-
Qaida and the Islamic State’s Yemen
branch ‘‘deepen their inroads across
much of the country.’’ The head of the
International Rescue Committee,
former British Foreign Minister David
Miliband, said in a recent interview
that ‘‘the winners are the extremist
groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS.’’ Late
last year, the Wall Street Journal re-
ported that ‘‘nearly two years after
being driven from its stronghold in
Yemen, one of al Qaeda’s most dan-
gerous franchises has entrenched itself
in the country’s hinterlands as a dev-
astating war creates the conditions for
its comeback.’’
Here is something that should deeply
concern us all. At a time when we are
spending billions to fight terrorism all
over the world, a February CNN report
revealed that Saudi Arabia and its coa-
lition partners have transferred Amer-
ican-made weapons to al-Qaida-linked
fighters in Yemen. Does anyone here
think it makes sense that U.S. weapons
should be given to groups who have de-
clared war against the United States?
This war is both a humanitarian and
a strategic disaster.
Let us also not forget that this war is
being led by a despotic, undemocratic
regime in Saudi Arabia. The United
States of America—the most powerful
country on Earth—should not be led
into a regional war by our client states
that are trying to serve their own nar-
row and selfish interests.
It should not be Saudi Arabia that is
developing and implementing Amer-
ican foreign and military policy. Saudi
Arabia is a monarchy controlled by one
of the wealthiest families in the
world—the Saud family. In a 2017 re-
port by the Cato Institute, Saudi Ara-
bia was ranked 149th out of 159 coun-
tries for freedom and human rights. Is
this really the kind of country whose
foreign policy we should be supporting
with U.S. taxpayer dollars?
For decades, the Saudis have funded
schools, mosques, and preachers who
promote an extreme form of Islam
known as Wahhabism.
In Saudi Arabia today, women are
treated as third-class citizens. Women
still need the permission of a male
guardian to go to school or to get a job.
They have to follow a strict dress code
and can be stoned to death for adultery
or flogged for spending time in the
company of a man who is not their rel-
ative.
Last year, Saudi activist Loujain al-
Hathloul, a leader in the fight for wom-
en’s rights, was kidnapped from Abu
Dhabi and forced to return to the coun-
try. She is currently imprisoned, along
with many other human rights activ-
ists. Human Rights Watch reported
that imprisoned women activists have
been subjected to torture, including
electric shocks, and other forms of
physical and sexual assault.
The people of the entire world re-
ceived a very clear understanding of
the nature of the Saudi regime with
the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the
Saudi consulate in Turkey. All of the
evidence suggests that the Saudi
Crown Prince was directly responsible
for that murder. Is that really the kind
of regime whose leads we in the United
States should be following?
I believe the U.S. Congress has be-
come far too comfortable with military
interventions all over the world. We
have now been in Afghanistan for near-
ly 18 years—the longest war in Amer-
ican history. We also have troops in
many other countries around the
world. The time is long overdue for
Congress to reassert its constitutional
role in determining when and where
our country goes to war. This resolu-
tion provides that opportunity.
I hope this body will do exactly as it
did in December and, in a bipartisan
manner, pass this resolution. The hu-
manitarian catastrophe has only got-
ten worse in Yemen, and our interven-
tion there is every bit as unconstitu-
tional as it was when we passed this
resolution in December.
Let us bring this catastrophic war in
Yemen to an end. Let us focus our ef-
forts on a diplomatic resolution to end
that war. Let us provide the humani-
tarian aid needed to protect the hungry
and the sick in Yemen. In a historic
vote 45 years after the passage of the
War Powers Act, let us today reassert
Congress’s constitutional responsi-
bility in terms of war-making.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Connecticut.
Mr. MURPHY. Thank you very much,
Mr. President.
Once again, I am very pleased to join
my friend the Senator from Vermont
on the floor to press this body to take
seriously its constitutional responsi-
bility and its responsibility to ensure
that the United States doesn’t enter
into hostilities abroad other than in
those situations that are vitally nec-
essary to protect our national security
interests.
I am so proud to have worked with
Senator SANDERS, Senator LEE, and
many others here to build a truly bi-
partisan coalition that is going to do
something that, as Senator SANDERS
said, is historic.
I have been coming down to the Sen-
ate floor for 4 years now raising con-
cerns about U.S. participation in this
civil war. When the United States first
entered into an agreement with the
Saudis to help them in their bombing
campaign, very few people could prob-
ably locate Yemen on the map. Today,
it is the subject of national conversa-
tion. With passage in the Senate and
the House, regardless of what the
President chooses to do, the world now
knows that the United States is paying
attention to the world’s worst humani-
tarian disaster—a nightmare inside
Yemen that is taking the lives of tens
of thousands of people.
Sometimes humanitarian disasters
and famines are caused by natural
events, those that we cannot control—
droughts, for instance. This is a man-
made humanitarian catastrophe that
the United States has something to say
about, and we are going to say some-
thing about it in a matter of hours.
Let me just say a few things about
what will happen if we pass this resolu-
tion and it becomes law and what will
not happen if we pass this resolution
and it becomes law. I think Senator
SANDERS covered this, and we have cov-
ered this enough.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1826 March 13, 2019
The first thing that happens is that
we uphold the Constitution.
I get it. Declaring war is a lot tough-
er today than it was 40 years ago or 100
years ago. It is not as if there are big
armies that march against each other
across open fields. Very rarely is there
a nice peace treaty signed to wrap up
hostilities. Now we have shadowy and
more diffuse enemies who are harder to
define. We have wars that seem to
never end. But that doesn’t obviate
Congress’s responsibility to set param-
eters around war. Just because it is
harder to declare war today doesn’t
mean that we still don’t have the re-
sponsibility to do it.
Over and over again, we have
outsourced the decision on hostilities
to the President, whether it be Presi-
dent Obama or President Trump. In
large part, it is because we just don’t
want to be in this business any longer.
There is no doubt that when we are
helping Saudi Arabia drop bombs on
churches, on weddings, on cholera
treatment facilities, and on some le-
gitimate military targets, we are en-
gaged in a war, and we should declare
it here. That is the first thing that
happens.
The second thing that happens if we
pass this resolution and it becomes law
is that we wash our hands of the blood
associated with being a participant in
the creation of one the world’s worst
humanitarian catastrophes.
Never has the world seen a cholera
epidemic as big as this one, at least in
recorded history. There is no secret as
to why there is a cholera epidemic; it is
because the Saudis bombed the water
treatment facilities, so the water isn’t
clean any longer.
Whether or not the United States
knew about this or signed off on it, we
don’t know, but the fact is, we should
not be associated with a bombing cam-
paign that the U.N. tells us is likely a
gross violation of human rights.
Third, if we pass this resolution and
it becomes law, peace becomes more
likely.
We have evidence of why that is be-
cause when we passed this resolution in
the Senate at the end of last year, not
coincidentally, within days, a partial
ceasefire was announced in Hodeidah.
Why is that? The reason is twofold.
One, when the Saudis realize they don’t
have a blank check from the United
States any longer, they get more seri-
ous about peace. Two, the Houthis, who
are the other party to this conflict and
who don’t believe that the United
States is an honest broker or that any-
one will actually be serious about en-
forcing concessions they give, come to
the table because they see that the
United States and others that we sup-
port as part of the negotiations will ac-
tually be honest brokers and that we
are only willing to go so far with our
Saudi partners.
The fourth thing that happens, as
Senator SANDERS has mentioned, is
that we are able to send a message to
Saudi Arabia and specifically to the
Crown Prince that they need to change
their behavior if they want to maintain
this relationship.
Some people are going to vote
against this because they say it has
nothing to do with Jamal Khashoggi. It
does. Jamal Khashoggi’s name isn’t in
here. The names of the other American
residents who are currently being de-
tained by Saudi Arabia aren’t in here.
But make no mistake—Muhammad bin
Salman, who ordered this campaign of
political repression—his No. 1 foreign
policy priority is the perpetuation of
the war inside Yemen.
Given the violation of trust that has
occurred with the United States over
the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and
the coverup of it, it stands to reason
that we would rethink our association
with other priorities of the Crown
Prince’s if he blatantly lied to us about
his participation in the human rights
violation that has become the obses-
sion of this country and the world. The
two are connected. This will be seen as
a message to the Saudis that they need
to clean up their act.
What will not happen? Casualties will
not get worse. The Trump administra-
tion says: Well, if we are not part of
the coalition, it just means we can’t
stop civilians from being killed.
Well, forgive me, but it doesn’t seem
like we have been doing too good of a
job thus far if 85,000 children under the
age of 5 have died of starvation and dis-
ease and tens of thousands of civilians
have been caught in the crossfire. We
can’t get into classified information
here, but let’s just say there is a limit
to what the United States can do as
part of this coalition.
There is no evidence to suggest that
casualties will get worse. In fact, the
cover being lifted of U.S. endorsements
of this bombing campaign will make it
harder for the Saudis to take chances
because they know they don’t have the
United States to fall back on.
Second, the Saudis will not go some-
where else. This idea that if we just say
we are not going to participate in this
one single war with you, that the
Saudis will all of a sudden break rela-
tionships with the United States and
go buy their military equipment from
Russia, is belied by how this alliance
has worked for years. The complication
of the Saudis turning around and
choosing to go to another partner, if
that is how this works, that the nature
of our relationship is one in which the
United States can never ever refuse a
request from the Saudis to participate
in one of their military endeavors over-
seas, then that is not an alliance. An
alliance allows you to tell your partner
when you think they are wrong and
choose, unless you have a treaty obli-
gation of some sort, whether you en-
gage with them.
Lastly, as I mentioned, some people
say we will lose our political leverage;
that we will make it harder for nego-
tiations to happen. It is exactly the op-
posite, as evidenced by the fact that
when we were debating this resolution
last time, as people were telling us
that if we passed it we wouldn’t have
as much leverage in the negotiations,
successful negotiations were being con-
cluded in Stockholm.
This is a historic moment for the
Congress to step up and say that
enough is enough. We are made weaker
in the eyes of the world when we will-
ingly participate in war crimes and
when we allow for our partner to en-
gage in activity that leads to the
slaughter of innocents.
Never mind the conduct of a war in
which our true enemies, al-Qaida and
ISIS, are getting stronger and stronger
by the day. I hope we have the same bi-
partisan stamp of approval on this res-
olution today as we did last year, and
I hope it stands as a new day for the
Senate when we are more willing, on a
bipartisan basis, to do our concurrent
responsibility, along with the execu-
tive branch, to set the foreign policy of
this Nation.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I
rise to again support efforts to stop
U.S. direct military support for the
Saudi-led coalition efforts in Yemen.
I do not need to remind my col-
leagues what is at stake. Each time we
have considered this resolution, the
situation for Yemenis is even more
dire.
Now in its fourth year, this conflict
has put nearly 16 million people on the
brink of starvation, including 400,000
children who are severely malnour-
ished, displaced more than 3 million
people, and done nothing to increase
stability or prosperity for the people of
Yemen. In fact, the longer this conflict
goes on, the larger Iran’s foothold in
Yemen grows and the more entrenched
opposing political factions become.
In addition to the horrifying humani-
tarian crisis, we have also learned that
U.S. coalition partners may be trans-
ferring U.S.-origin weapons to known—
underline known—terrorist organiza-
tions. We have read alarming reports
about torture and abuse in prisons
throughout Yemen—both Houthi and
coalition controlled.
I will simply repeat what I have said
before. It is in the interest of the
United States to put as much political
pressure on the parties to end this con-
flict as we can. Yes, we have strategic
partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates, but we must
find a way forward to get those rela-
tionships on a path that truly serves
U.S. interests.
To be clear, the Houthis bear signifi-
cant responsibility in the deterioration
of the state of affairs in Yemen, and
that is without a doubt. We do not have
diplomatic relations with the Houthis,
and we certainly don’t sell them arms
or provide active military support.
This resolution is a good first step, but
what we really need is a comprehensive
approach to address our interests in
the gulf.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1827
March 13, 2019
Along with Senators YOUNG, REED,
GRAHAM, SHAHEEN, COLLINS, and MUR-
PHY, I introduced the comprehensive
Saudi Arabia Accountability and
Yemen Act. The bill calls for a suspen-
sion of offensive weapons sales to Saudi
Arabia, sanctions all persons respon-
sible for blocking humanitarian access
in Yemen or supporting the Houthis in
Yemen, and urges accountability for
all actors in Yemen guilty of war
crimes.
Finally, it also addresses some of the
most reckless Saudi actions by calling
for true accountability for those re-
sponsible for the murder of American
resident and journalist, Jamal
Khashoggi, and a report on human
rights in Saudi Arabia.
I support this resolution and encour-
age us to continue to debate. We must
evaluate our relationship with these
partners and find a path forward not
just in Yemen but indeed in the entire
gulf region that truly promotes Amer-
ican interests and American values.
Today is a day we can make a clear
and unequivocal statement that we do
not support this continuing conflict
and humanitarian disaster. There is a
consequence for acting in the way the
coalition has—in many cases, clearly,
irresponsibly, with the reckless loss of
human life. I hope we can continue to
work to go beyond that so we can deal
with the entire region’s challenges.
I look forward to whatever is the
agreement on amendments that may be
considered here. I personally would
like to see us get an up-or-down vote as
a resolution. I understand there may be
some amendments.
Depending upon what amendments
are made in order, I may seek a second-
degree amendment at the end of the
day. I am concerned that one of these
amendments that are contemplated
may be well-intentioned but also may
very well be used in such a way to ac-
tually undermine the very essence of
the underlying vote we are taking.
I will reserve my judgment until that
time on that, but in the interim, I urge
all of my colleagues to continue to sup-
port it, as they did in the last vote on
this question of this resolution.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the
quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand with
Senator SANDERS and with Senator
MURPHY as a cosponsor of the legisla-
tion before us, S.J. Res. 7, which would
remove U.S. Armed Forces from Saudi
Arabia’s war in Yemen.
There were 56 Senators who voted in
favor of this resolution just a few
months ago, in December, or at the end
of the last Congress. That vote was, of
course, a victory for the Constitution
and for the separation of powers, to say
nothing of prudence, of peace, and of
justice. The House of Representatives
passed its own version of this resolu-
tion earlier this year. Now it is back to
us. Now it is our turn. Now it is our job
to get this passed. We have the oppor-
tunity today to reassert Congress’s
constitutional role over declaring war
and over putting American blood and
treasure on the line.
In this particular case, the evidence
is clear that we ought not be involved
in this unconstitutional, unjustified,
and, ultimately, immoral war. The
Yemeni war has claimed the lives of
tens of thousands of people, including
those of countless innocent civilians. It
has created countless refugees, or-
phans, widows, and it has also dis-
placed countless families. The numbers
are nothing short of staggering.
Since 2015, more than 6,000 civilians
have died, and more than 10,000 have
been wounded. The majority of these
casualties—over 10,000 of them—has
been as the result of airstrikes led by
the Saudi-led coalition. In one attack
last year, the Saudis dropped a U.S.-
made bomb on a schoolbus that killed
40 young children on a school trip and
wounded another 30 children in addi-
tion to that.
Yemen is now facing rampant disease
and mass starvation. An estimated 15
million people do not have access to
clean water and sanitation, and 17 mil-
lion don’t have access to food. Photo-
graphs from Yemen depict malnour-
ished children who have every rib in
their tiny bodies exposed and jetting
out as manifestations of their starva-
tion. Over 85,000 children have died of
starvation since 2015.
In short, the situation in Yemen has
become the worst humanitarian crisis
in the world, and the United States has
been abating the horrors of this war.
Indeed, our country has actually made
the crisis worse by helping one side
bomb innocent civilians. I don’t say
that lightly. It is with great soberness
that I raise this very real and very se-
rious accusation.
So it begs the question: How did we
get entangled in this crisis to begin
with? How did we get involved? Why
and how and under what circumstances
did this become our war to fight?
In March of 2015, Saudi Arabia
launched a war against the Houthi
rebels. Shortly after the Houthis
ousted the Saudi-backed government
in the capital city of Sanaa, the Obama
administration—without consulting
Congress, of course—authorized U.S.
military forces to provide logistical
and intelligence support to the King-
dom of Saudi Arabia-led coalition
fighting that war. U.S. military sup-
port has continued ever since then, for
the last 4 years, including with midair
refueling, surveillance, reconnaissance
information, and target selection as-
sistance. In other words, we have been
supporting and, in fact, have been ac-
tively participating in the activities of
war. We are involved in this conflict as,
no less, cobelligerents.
Some of my colleagues have argued
to the contrary and have suggested
that we are somehow not involved in
this war in Yemen. Yet, if we are hon-
est with ourselves, we know that isn’t
true. We know that this argument falls
dead flat on its face. As Defense Sec-
retary Jim Mattis himself acknowl-
edged in December of 2017, just a little
over a year ago, our military has been
helping the Saudis with target selec-
tion assistance or with ‘‘making cer-
tain they hit the right thing.’’
In other words, we are helping a for-
eign power bomb its adversaries in
what is, undoubtedly, indisputably, a
war. Previously, we were helping them
even with midair refueling assistance—
that is, helping Saudi jets that were en
route to bombing missions and other
combat missions on the ground inside
of Yemen. If that doesn’t constitute di-
rect involvement in a war, I don’t
know what does.
Other opponents of our resolution
claim somehow that our involvement
in Yemen is constitutional, that it is
lawful under the War Powers Act of
1973. It is true that under the War Pow-
ers Act, the executive branch is au-
thorized to use Armed Forces in cases
of emergencies and in other certain,
rigid, well-established time con-
straints. Yet, you see, the conflict in
Yemen does not constitute a threat to
the safety of American citizens, and
our involvement has far surpassed any
emergency time allotted under the War
Powers Resolution.
The Houthis, while, perhaps, no
friends of the American people, make
up a regional rebel group that does not
itself threaten American national secu-
rity. In fact, the longer we fight
against it, the more we give reason to
it to hate America and to embrace the
opportunists who are our true enemies
in the region—those who make up the
regime in power in Iran. The more we
prolong the activities that destabilize
this region, the longer we harm our
own interests in terms of trade and
broader regional security.
The War Powers Act also states that
the assignment of U.S. Armed Forces
to coordinate and to participate in the
hostilities of a foreign power, of a for-
eign country, itself constitutes a con-
flict of war. Some have argued that we
have not been engaging in hostilities
and, therefore, somehow, have not vio-
lated the War Powers Act. This claim
falls flat in several respects.
First, the claim itself is categori-
cally untrue. As we heard before, we
are literally telling the Saudis what to
bomb, what to hit, and what and whom
to take out.
Second, these opponents are relying
on an old, 1976 memorandum that is in-
ternal to the executive branch and in-
ternal to the Department of Defense
itself that was written by a lawyer
within the Department of Defense.
Talk about the fox guarding the hen-
house. It defers to a Department of De-
fense lawyer’s memorandum from 1976
that uses an unreasonably,

S1828 March 13, 2019
unsustainably, indefensibly slim defini-
tion of the word ‘‘hostilities.’’ This def-
inition may or may not have been rel-
evant then. I don’t know. I was only 5
years old at the time it was written.
Yet we no longer live in a world in
which ‘‘war’’ means exclusively two
competing countries that are lined up
on opposite ends of the battlefield, in
two columns, and that are engaged in
direct exchanges of fire across the
same ground. That is not how war is
waged anymore.
War activities, of course, have
changed dramatically since 1976. Like
bell-bottoms and so many fads of that
era, this is a dynamic that has changed
today. Our war in today’s America in-
creasingly relies on high technology
and on high-technology solutions. Our
wars have involved cyber activity, re-
connaissance, surveillance, and high-
tech target selection. These, by the
way, are the precise activities that we
ourselves are undertaking in Yemen. It
is not just that we are involved some-
how on the sidelines. These activities
themselves constitute war.
Even aside from this overly narrow,
cramped, and indefensible definition of
the word ‘‘hostilities’’ and separate and
apart from the definition of the word
‘‘hostilities,’’ under the War Powers
Act, we ourselves do not have to tech-
nically be involved in hostilities in
order to trigger the responsibilities of
the Congress under the War Powers Act
in order to make sure that the legisla-
tive branch actually does its job to de-
clare war or to authorize the use of
military force under the War Powers
Act and under the Constitution. The
War Powers Act, in fact, is triggered so
long as we are sufficiently involved
with the armed forces of another na-
tion when those armed forces of an-
other nation are themselves involved
in hostilities, which they indisputably
are.
The Saudi-led coalition directing the
activities in the civil war in Yemen
against the Houthis is undeniably in-
volved in hostilities. We are undeni-
ably assisting the coalition in those
movements, in those activities, in
those acts of war. We, therefore, by def-
inition under the plain language of the
War Powers Act itself, are subjected to
the terms of the War Powers Act. The
Saudis are, without question, involved
in those hostilities. We can’t doubt
that. No one here can credibly claim to
the contrary.
Finally, some argue that this resolu-
tion might somehow harm or under-
mine or hurt our efforts to combat ter-
rorism in the region specifically with
regard to al-Qaida and ISIS. Impor-
tantly, however, this resolution explic-
itly states that the resolution would
not impede the military’s ability to
fight these terror groups. In fact, U.S.
involvement in Yemen has, arguably,
undermined the effort against al-
Qaida’s affiliates. The State Depart-
ment’s Country Reports on Terrorism
for 2016 found that the conflict between
the Saudi-led forces and Houthi insur-
gents has actually helped al-Qaida in
the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, as it
is often described, and ISIS’ Yemen
branch to ‘‘deepen their inroads across
much of the country.’’
It appears that our involvement in
Yemen accomplishes no good at all,
only harm—and significant harm at
that. Recent events are bringing that
into an even clearer light. In October,
there was the killing of Jamal
Khashoggi. Then, just the week before
last, news broke that the Saudis tor-
tured a man while he was detained
there in 2017. He had dual citizenship in
the United States and Saudi Arabia.
Shortly before that, a report also came
out that suggested that Saudi Arabia
had transferred American-made, Amer-
ican-manufactured weapons to al-
Qaida-linked fighters and to other mil-
itant groups. In other words, the
Saudis are likely using our own weap-
ons in violation of our own end-user
agreements with them, by the way, to
commit these atrocities of war. That is
not OK.
It is becoming clearer and clearer
that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is
not an ally that deserves our unwaver-
ing, unquestioning, unflinching sup-
port. It is not an ally that deserves our
support or our military intervention,
especially when our own security—the
safety of the American people—is not
on the line, and I haven’t heard anyone
in this body maintain otherwise.
Indeed, perhaps we ought not be sup-
porting this regime at all. At a bare
minimum, we ought not be deferring
unflinchingly to this regime, and we
ought not be fighting an unjust war on
its behalf half a world away, putting at
risk not only U.S. treasure but also,
potentially, U.S. blood and the blood of
countless innocent civilians who are in
the line of fire as a result of this. To
the contrary, to continue supporting
them in this war would be bad diplo-
macy and would undermine our very
credibility on the world stage.
Look, regardless of where you stand
on this war, these decisions matter,
and we ought to take them seriously.
In fact, each and every one of us has
sworn an oath to take things like this
seriously.
The Constitution puts the war-mak-
ing power—the power to declare war—
in the hands of Congress. There was a
good reason for this. It has everything
to do with the fact that Congress is the
branch of the Federal Government
most accountable to the people at the
most regular intervals, and our Found-
ing Fathers wisely understood that it
was dangerous to allow the powers of
government to accumulate in the
hands of the few or in the hands of one
person.
One of the reasons they put the war-
making power in the hands of Congress
is they wanted to make a strong break
away from the system that had evolved
in our old system of government, the
one involved in our old capital based in
London, where the chief executive him-
self had the power unilaterally to make
war.
This was a decided break from that
tradition. There were other traditions
that we continued, that we adopted.
Many of our rights, our liberties, our
processes in government were pat-
terned after the British model. This
one was not. It was deliberately the
choice of the Founding Fathers not to
continue with that tradition, and that
is why we and only we can declare war.
You see, it is not that we are flaw-
less. It is not that we are any smarter
than people in other branches. Quite to
the contrary, it has only to do—and ev-
erything to do—with the fact that we
are more accountable to the people at
more routine intervals.
When you put the power to declare
war or authorize the use of military
force in Congress, you guarantee that
this decision will be made carefully
and deliberately in full view of the
American people. Public debates have a
way of bringing the American people
into the discussion, into the delibera-
tion.
You see, there is no such thing as a
clean war. There is no such thing as a
war that is detached from moral peril,
from moral consequences, from grave
and heartbreaking results in which in-
nocent men, women, and children lose
their lives or are subjected to the worst
privations known to human beings.
It is for that very reason that we owe
it to those affected by war—not just
the brave men and women who fight for
us and protect us but for people all
over the world and for the good name
of the United States to be protected—
that as we publicly debate the moral
consequences of war, the grave impli-
cations that war has for our country
and others involved in the conflict are
the business of all of the American peo-
ple and should never be reserved for
one person.
We need to carefully weigh the risks
and merits of engaging in any conflict
in an open and in an honest manner. So
instead of placing this power in the
hands of a King or even just in the ex-
ecutive branch generally where it can
be used unilaterally to declare war, the
Founders placed it here in Congress,
knowing that we are more accountable
to the people than the other branches,
and the power would be less likely to
be abused here.
There is a lot at stake. There is a lot
at stake whenever the lives of Amer-
ican military personnel are placed on
the line and whenever the lives of inno-
cent men, women, and children are on
the line, too—precious lives, each of
immeasurable worth. These decisions
result in the shedding of blood, the
shedding of blood that will be on our
hands if we fail both to exercise our
constitutional prerogatives and to take
that very responsibility very seriously.
Over the last 80 years, we have trag-
ically seen what happens when the
muscle of the legislative branch begins
to atrophy as a result of the failure of
those who occupy these very seats to
exercise their legislative muscle. When
we fail to exercise that power that the

Constitution entrusts to us, entrusted
to us in that document to which each
of us has taken an oath, we imperil the
entire system and the safety of our
country. We also cheapen the moral
certainty with which our Armed Forces

DIRECTING THE REMOVAL OF
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES
FROM HOSTILITIES IN THE RE-
PUBLIC OF YEMEN THAT HAVE
NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED BY CON-
GRESS
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee be discharged from
further consideration of S.J. Res. 7 and
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of S.J. Res. 7. I fur-
ther ask that there be 2 hours of de-
bate, equally divided between the two
leaders or their designees, with 10 min-
utes of the Democratic time being re-
served for Senator MENENDEZ; further,
that the following amendments be
called up and reported by number, Paul
amendment No. 193, Inhofe amendment
No. 194, and Rubio amendment No. 195;
further, that no other first-degree
amendments be in order and no second-
degree amendments be in order prior to
a vote in relation to these amend-
ments; finally, that upon the use or
yielding back of that time, the Senate
vote in relation to the amendments in
the order listed and that following the
disposition of the amendments, the
joint resolution, as amended, if amend-
ed, be read a third time and the Senate
vote on passage of the joint resolution
as amended, if amended, with 2 min-
utes equally divided prior to each vote.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The clerk will report the resolution
by title.
The bill clerk read as follows:
A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 7) to direct
the removal of United States Armed Forces
from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen
that have not been authorized by Congress.
Thereupon, the committee was dis-
charged, and the Senate proceeded to
consider the resolution.
AMENDMENTS NOS. 193, 194, AND 195
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the amendments by
number.
The bill clerk read the amendments
as follows:
The Senator from Utah [Mr. LEE], for oth-
ers, proposes amendments numbered 193, 194,
and 195.
The amendments are as follows:
AMENDMENT NO. 193
(Purpose: To provide that nothing in the
joint resolution may be construed as au-
thorizing the use of military force)
At the end, add the following:
SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REGARDING NO
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILI-
TARY FORCE.
Consistent with section 8(a)(1) of the War
Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1547(a)(1)),
nothing in this joint resolution may be con-
strued as authorizing the use of military
force.
AMENDMENT NO. 194
(Purpose: To provide an exception for sup-
porting efforts to defend against ballistic
missile, cruise missile, and unmanned aer-
ial vehicle threats to civilian population
centers in coalition countries, including
locations where citizens and nationals of
the United States reside)
On page 5, line 7, insert after ‘‘associated
forces’’ the following: ‘‘or operations to sup-
port efforts to defend against ballistic mis-
sile, cruise missile, and unmanned aerial ve-
hicle threats to civilian population centers
in coalition countries, including locations
where citizens and nationals of the United
States reside’’.
AMENDMENT NO. 195
(Purpose: To provide a rule of construction
regarding intelligence sharing)
Insert after section 3 the following new
section:
SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REGARDING IN-
TELLIGENCE SHARING.
Nothing in this joint resolution may be
construed to influence or disrupt any intel-
ligence, counterintelligence, or investigative
activities relating to threats in or ema-
nating from Yemen conducted by, or in con-
junction with, the United States Govern-
ment involving—
(1) the collection of intelligence;
(2) the analysis of intelligence; or
(3) the sharing of intelligence between the
United States and any coalition partner if
the President determines such sharing is ap-
propriate and in the national security inter-
ests of the United States.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, just like
last year, I remain deeply concerned
about the humanitarian situation in
Yemen, as well as the erratic behavior
of Saudi Arabia’s leadership. We have
all suffered through that.
However, I oppose the resolution
brought forth by Senators LEE, MUR-
PHY, and SANDERS, which, if imple-
mented, would end all security co-
operation with our partners in Yemen
against the Houthis.
First of all, we are not engaged in
hostilities in Yemen against the
Houthis, and here is what we are doing
in Yemen: We are providing intel-
ligence support that helps construct
no-strike lists that enable humani-
tarian efforts and protect humani-
tarian aid workers.
Some of these workers are workers
we are very close to—our allies. Our in-
telligence support is also vital to as-
sisting our partners in defending them-
selves against the Iranian-supported
ballistic missile attacks.
It is important to emphasize that our
partners are the tip of the spear, not
us. Beyond this, our security coopera-
tion provides leverage that we have
used with the Saudi-led coalition to ad-
vance peace negotiations.
If we pull that support, here is what
we can expect: Israel loses, Iran wins,
and the humanitarian situation will
get worse. I think we all understand
that.
Our partners will be less capable to
confront the lethal ballistic missile
threat, and peace efforts will lose a
vital line of support. Moreover, if a bal-
listic missile hits a population center
and kills Americans because we, due to
the resolution, withheld intelligence, it
would be unforgiveable. That is why I
introduced an amendment to specifi-
cally protect our civilian population.
In closing, the vote is not about
whether we approve of Saudi Arabia’s
behavior; I don’t. It is about whether
we will use our leverage with the
Saudi-led coalition to ensure humani-
tarian access and promote peace, and,
more fundamentally, it is about wheth-
er we take seriously our responsibility
to keep Americans safe. That is really
what this is all about. It merely in-
cludes that we would eliminate the
threats to civilian population centers
in coalition countries, including loca-
tions where citizens and nationals of
the United States reside. I can’t imag-
ine anyone would be opposed to that.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the
quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to
support the joint resolution of dis-
approval and to urge my colleagues to
do so as well.
Let’s be clear, there is no national
security emergency at the south-
western border. The President and his
administration continue to mislead
Americans about what really is hap-
pening at the border in order to fulfill
a misguided campaign promise to build
a wall. After weeks of threats and toy-
ing with the idea of declaring a na-
tional emergency to circumvent Con-
gress, the President, in my view,
wrongly issued such a proclamation on
February 15 under the authority of the
National Emergencies Act.
This proclamation redirects military
construction funds provided by Con-
gress to the Department of Defense for
projects deemed important to the read-
iness, welfare, and missions of our
Armed Forces. This action is an ex-
treme overreach of Executive author-
ity. No President has ever declared a
national emergency to circumvent
Congress for a construction project he
failed to get approved through legisla-
tion.
In fact, this authority to use mili-
tary construction funds in an emer-
gency has only been used twice for
projects in the United States—first by
President George Herbert Walker Bush
during Operation Desert Shield and
then by President George W. Bush in
the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist at-
tacks—and those projects addressed

immediate and recognized needs of our
warfighters. While the administration
claims President Obama also used this
authority, the distinction is, he used it
for its true intent, to provide facilities
quickly in overseas locations for our
warfighters in combat zones. To say
those needs are the same as President
Trump’s campaign pledge to build a
wall is simply wrong and misleading.
The President tries to justify this
emergency as responding to a humani-
tarian crisis at the border, but the wall
is not an effective solution to that cri-
sis. What he ignores is the fact that the
House and Senate overwhelmingly ap-
proved $22.54 billion in border security
funding in the recent appropriations
bill to enhance physical barriers at
ports of entry, to hire additional law
enforcement personnel, to address the
humanitarian needs of migrants, and
to increase counternarcotics and
counterweapons detection technologies
used at the border. Moreover, I would
argue that to truly stop the influx of
migrants at our southern border, there
has to be a much more coordinated
international effort led by the Depart-
ment of State to address the conditions
in Central America that cause mi-
grants to leave their homes. Stopping
mass migration at the source is the
most effective and humane policy.
In its statement opposing the resolu-
tion before us today, the administra-
tion characterizes increasing numbers
of ‘‘family units, unaccompanied mi-
nors, and persons claiming a fear of re-
turn’’ as a national security threat and
a national emergency. Let us be clear.
These groups of people present no mili-
tary threat to our Nation. General
O’Shaughnessy, Commander of U.S.
Northern Command, confirmed this in
a hearing before the Senate Armed
Services Committee on February 26,
when he said: ‘‘The threats to our na-
tion from our southern border are not
military in nature.’’ So I have a hard
time understanding why the adminis-
tration thinks it is acceptable to use
Department of Defense dollars for a
wall that would provide little to no
value to the Department of Defense in
countering the very real military
threats our Nation does confront
across the globe.
Some have argued that the wall is a
necessary response to the opioid crisis
we are experiencing. There is no doubt
we have a serious substance abuse cri-
sis in this country. According to the
Centers for Disease Control, over 70,000
people died in 2017 of drug overdoses.
That means more people died that year
because of drug overdoses than due to
car crashes or gun violence. These
numbers are staggering, and no com-
munity is immune. Congress has
worked in a bipartisan manner to com-
bat this crisis, passing landmark legis-
lation and historic increases in fund-
ing, but the administration has failed
to live up to its commitments. A wall
will not fix this problem.
Indeed, while the administration
would have the American people be-
lieve these drugs are coming across the
southwestern border between ports of
entry—where they want to build this
wall—the facts from the Drug Enforce-
ment Agency’s 2018 National Drug
Threat Assessment reveal otherwise.
In the case of heroin, in their words,
‘‘The majority of flow is through [pri-
vately owned vehicles] entering the
United States at legal ports of entry.’’
This will not be stopped by building a
wall.
When it comes to fentanyl, according
to the National Drug Threat Assess-
ment, smaller quantities but of higher
purity are ‘‘transported into the
United States in parcel packages di-
rectly from China or from China
through Canada.’’ A wall on the south-
west border will not stop packages of
fentanyl coming through the mail from
China. Again, according to the DEA,
the fentanyl that is smuggled in from
Mexico is most commonly, in their
words, ‘‘concealed in [vehicles] . . .
through [southwest border ports of
entry]’’—not through the terrain where
the President wants to build a wall.
To underscore this point, just 2 days
ago, Customs and Border Patrol an-
nounced the seizure of the biggest ship-
ment of cocaine recovered at the ports
of New York and New Jersey in 25
years. About 1.6 tons of cocaine were
seized from a shipping container that
arrived at the port in Newark, NJ.
President Trump’s wall would not have
stopped this shipment.
Instead of addressing, for example,
the high-purity fentanyl and fentanyl
precursors coming from China or im-
proving law enforcement’s ability to
detect and seize drugs at the ports of
entry, this emergency declaration for a
wall will divert billions of dollars from
our troops and other national defense
priorities and will not make our coun-
try any safer. Canceling or delaying
military construction projects will
have damaging impacts to the military
services. These projects are intended to
improve deteriorating airfields and
piers, provide modern training and
maintenance facilities, rehabilitate an-
tiquated and hazardous hospitals and
schools, remediate environmental con-
tamination at former bases, and con-
tribute to alliance and partnership re-
sponsibilities around the globe.
Bypassing congressional intent that
these funds be used on vetted military
construction projects in order to build
a border wall Congress has rejected
time and again is an affront to our Na-
tion’s system of checks and balances.
It is also an abuse of the power of Con-
gress granted to the President to use in
times of true security emergencies or
in times of war to address the imme-
diate needs of our Armed Forces.
Furthermore, the administration
wants to use another authority, title 10
United States Code, section 284, which
allows the Department of Defense,
without requiring an emergency dec-
laration, to ‘‘provide support for the
counterdrug activities or activities to
counter transnational organized crime
of any other department or agency of
the Federal Government,’’ to include
the ‘‘[c]onstruction of roads and fences
and installation of lighting to block
drug smuggling corridors across inter-
national boundaries of the United
States.’’
This seems to be within the realm of
the President’s contemplation, but be-
cause there is only about $238 million
remaining in this counterdrug account,
the administration plans to reprogram
roughly $2.5 billion appropriated in
other DOD accounts into this
counterdrug account to use for the
wall. We know much of the funds being
transferred would not be used for their
original intent.
For example, the Army will have ex-
cess funding in military pay because it
will not meet anticipated end strength,
and fewer personnel opted into the new
blended retirement system than antici-
pated, which created savings. However,
instead of transferring these dollars to
higher priority defense needs, DOD will
have to use these amounts for the wall.
Ironically, the $238 million now re-
maining in the counterdrug accounts
will not be used for its original purpose
of providing critical intelligence, sur-
veillance, reconnaissance, and other
detection capabilities for drug interdic-
tion in the Caribbean, Central and
South America, and Asia. It will be
used to build a wall that will not solve
the Nation’s drug problems. We are lit-
erally taking money that is now being
used to help interdict the flow of drugs
through the Caribbean, in the Pacific,
et cetera, and will put it into the
ground in Mexico, where the drugs are
not passing through.
We also know DOD has immediate
and compelling needs of its own that
we should be addressing. The Air Force
and the Marines need billions of dollars
to clean up and rebuild Tyndall Air
Force Base and Camp Lejeune after
hurricanes devastated both installa-
tions last year. According to the Ma-
rines, it is about $3.5 billion to Camp
Lejeune, and—according to some num-
bers I have seen for Tyndall—it is
about $5 billion for Tyndall. Instead of
fixing Camp Lejeune and Tyndall Air
Force Base, the President is going to
take that $8 billion and put it into a
wall through the deserts of the South-
west.
What is more important to the na-
tional security of the United States
than rebuilding our major Marine
Corps facility on the Atlantic Coast
and rebuilding our major Air Force fa-
cility in the Florida Panhandle? I
think, clearly, we should invest in our
troops in the Marines and Air Force.
We know all of the services continue to
have readiness gaps in aircraft mainte-
nance, depot maintenance, and ship
overhauls. We know there continues to
be a shortage of childcare facilities in
certain locations, but these very real
needs in our military are put in jeop-
ardy because of the President’s obses-
sion with building a wall on the border.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1831
March 13, 2019
As I indicated, the President intends
to fill the 284 account by reprogram-
ming funds. Congress authorizes this
reprogramming process to allow the
Department of Defense to conduct a
certain amount of transfers of funds
between accounts for unforeseen prob-
lems. By tradition and custom, re-
programming is done with the specific
approval of the defense oversight com-
mittees, but this time, when DOD
transfers dollars to pay for the Presi-
dent’s wall, Congress will have no say.
The administration will only notify
Congress it is happening. Again, this is
another example of complete disregard
for the legislative branch’s role, as di-
rected by the Constitution, in approv-
ing and appropriating funds for the ac-
tivities of the executive branch.
Furthermore, the amount of funds
that can be reprogrammed in a year
has a $4 billion limit, and DOD will use
a significant portion of that $4 billion
to transfer money for the wall. This
means that billions of dollars of other
high-priority defense needs will not be
met this year, needs like ship mainte-
nance, unexpected fuel costs, vehicle
upgrades, and other equipment short-
falls we will see at the end of this year.
The Department of Defense is in a situ-
ation where they have ships that have
to be refueled, they have ships that
have to be overhauled, they have equip-
ment that must be prepared for the
readiness of the troops that they will
not have the money for because it has
been spent already, and they have ex-
hausted their reprogramming not serv-
ing the needs of the military but build-
ing a wall in the middle of the deserts
of the Southwest.
We need to address the real issues at
our southwest border. To do so, I will
continue to support effective border se-
curity measures, such as those in the
recently passed Homeland Security Ap-
propriations Act to invest in new tech-
nology and equipment, increase the
number of Customs and Border Protec-
tion agents, and make smart physical
improvements at ports of entry.
This law also included funding to in-
crease the number of immigration
judges to help reduce the backlog in
our immigration system, provide hu-
manitarian aid for Central American
countries, and address humanitarian
concerns at the border.
These efforts are important and ap-
propriate for the true nature of the sit-
uation, but I cannot support diverting
billions of dollars of money from the
needs of our men and women in uni-
form to fulfill a campaign promise.
Therefore, I will vote in support of the
resolution to terminate the President’s
inappropriate declaration.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

S.J. RES. 7
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I
wanted to come down here and partici-
pate in this debate. It is the second one
we have had in a couple of months on
the floor of the U.S. Senate regarding
this resolution with regard to U.S.
policies and participation in helping
Saudi Arabia—a difficult ally but nev-
ertheless a longstanding ally of the
United States—in its conflict with re-
gard to Yemen. There have been a
number of speeches, as there were last
time we debated this issue a few
months ago on the Senate floor.
I do want to call out my Senate col-
league from the great State of Utah,
Senator LEE, who has been down here
passionately arguing the issue of con-
stitutional authority that the Presi-
dent may or may not have with regard
to our U.S. military activities with re-
gard to the conflict in Yemen. Senator
LEE is a great constitutional scholar.
He is someone who cares deeply about
this issue, as do I. He is one of the lead-
ers in the Senate on this issue. That is
where he has been focused. That is why
I believe he is part of this resolution
that we are going to be voting on here
in a few minutes on the Senate floor.
I happen to disagree with him that
under the War Powers Act, the United
States of America doing air refueling
of Saudi aircraft—not above Yemen,
not above our conflict zone, but above
Saudi Arabia—would constitute hos-
tilities. I think that is too limiting a
view of that statutory prohibition in
the War Powers Act. I know Senator
LEE comes at this very honestly; I just
happen to respectfully disagree with
him.
I say to the Presiding Officer, as you
have been watching this debate, the
vast majority of my colleagues, all of
whom I have deep respect for—Senator
DURBIN, Senator SANDERS, Senator
MURPHY, and Senator MENENDEZ—have
all been on the floor the last hour or so
making the case that if we, the United
States, limit our involvement in this
war in Yemen, somehow it is going to
get better.
We all want the humanitarian crisis
in Yemen to end. We all want that. I
think all 100 U.S. Senators want that.
The arguments that have been made—
and by the way, they were made a cou-
ple of months ago. We debated this for
a week. Nearly every U.S. Senator
came down here on the floor. They
have just done it again. They said: The
Saudis are involved in this war in
Yemen, a civil war—they are—and the
involvement of the United States is ac-
tually increasing the humanitarian cri-
sis.
These are the arguments. I have been
listening. By the way, they were the
arguments a couple of months ago.
Senator after Senator after Senator
made that argument. Well, I just want-
ed to provide a counter-argument. I am
hoping my colleagues are listening be-
cause we should not pass this resolu-
tion. We should not pass this resolu-
tion.
One thing that all of these debates—
and I listened and I watched. Certainly,
we debated this a couple of months ago
for almost a whole week. Do you know
what word never came up from my col-
leagues in these debates—almost
never? The word ‘‘Iran.’’ Why is that
important? As the Presiding Officer
probably knows, the Houthis are actu-
ally backed by the Iranians. The Ira-
nians are the biggest state sponsor of
terrorism in the world. Right now, we
are having this debate all about the hu-
manitarian crisis in Yemen, which we
want to stop—we want to stop—but
this resolution would say: OK, one of
the best ways to stop it is we, the U.S.
Senate, are going to tell the U.S. mili-
tary that in terms of military assist-
ance regarding Yemen, they can’t work
at all anymore. We are not going to
allow that.
Somehow our lack of involvement is
going to, A, help end the war, and B,
help end the humanitarian crisis. That
is the argument. That is what we are
voting on right now. I happen to think
that argument is wrong. I think that,
but I am going to talk about some peo-
ple who have testified on this very
issue in the last couple of weeks who
have a lot of knowledge on this issue. I
am going to replay a little bit of what
they said because I think it is impor-
tant for other Senators to hear this.
Yes, we have a lot of experts, but I am
going to talk about some of the people
who have talked about this recently,
who I think have a little more exper-
tise on this issue than the vast major-
ity—I would say actually every Mem-
ber of this body, with all due respect.
Let me go back to this point. Right
now, as the Ayatollahs in Tehran
watch this debate, they are very
pleased. They are very pleased. Why?
Because nobody is talking about them.
Nobody is talking about them. Well, I
am going to talk about them.
First of all, with regard to what
started as a humanitarian crisis—
which has been going on for a long
time, but this war really kicked in
when Iranian-backed Houthi rebels
seized power in 2015. There is not a lot
of discussion about how this began, but
that is how it began. Tehran has been
trying to establish a Hezbollah-like en-
tity on the Arabian Peninsula in
Yemen, increasing capabilities to tar-
get cities in Saudi Arabia with ballistic
missiles supplied by Iran. This is all
part of Iran’s broader strategy in the
region to encircle our traditional al-
lies—Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Arab
States, and, of course, Israel—with
proxy fighters in Syria, Lebanon, and
Yemen. Yet nobody is talking about
Iran.
Let’s talk about the humanitarian
crisis in Yemen. U.S. humanitarian aid
has totaled almost $697 million in the
last 14 months. Yes, the Saudis could
do a much better job, but they have in-
vested over $1 billion in trying to end
the suffering.

Iran—the country that started this
war, the country that nobody on the
Senate floor is even talking about—has
not spent a dime to relieve the suf-
fering. Now, of course, they have sup-
plied weapons and ballistic missiles in
the tens of millions of dollars but noth-
ing to relieve the suffering.
(Mrs. BLACKBURN assumed the
Chair.)
There is something else here that I
wanted to reemphasize on the floor of
the Senate. The horrible death of Mr.
Khashoggi is something we have all
condemned. It is very important that
we do that. It is very important that
we get to the bottom of it. Again, there
has been a lot of discussion on that
death, and any death is a problem, but
let’s talk about some other deaths,
again, caused by the Iranians—a coun-
try we are not even talking about in
this debate.
In 2005, 2006, and 2007, they started
supplying Iraqi Shia militias with very
sophisticated, improvised explosive de-
vices that killed and wounded over
2,000 American soldiers—2,000 Amer-
ican soldiers.
Where is the outrage on that? How
come no one is talking about that
issue? Where are the editorials about
that issue—killing our servicemem-
bers?
The whole concept in which we have
to view this issue is through the lens of
the Iranian efforts to spread terrorism
and to push their malign interests, in-
cluding in Yemen. Yet, once again, it is
all about the Saudis, and no one is
talking about Iran. No one is talking
about Iran.
What has happened in the last couple
of days since we debated this issue 2
months ago? Well, we had an Armed
Services Committee hearing. It was
classified, but I am going to talk about
things that I asked some of the wit-
nesses—all of the witnesses with regard
to operations in Yemen and Saudi Ara-
bia—and the answers are clearly not
classified.
I asked: Will stopping U.S. support to
help the Saudis end the conflict in
Yemen? No. Would it prevent more ci-
vilian casualties? No. Would it give le-
verage to our negotiators and speed up
the peace process? No. Would it support
Israel’s interests in the region? No.
Would it support the U.S. interests in
the region? No. Would it help embolden
Iran with its regional malign goals?
Yes.
These are the experts in the U.S. in-
telligence community and the Pen-
tagon giving these answers. This is
about 3 or 4 weeks ago. They are ques-
tions that I was asking.
Let me give you another group of ex-
perts. Just last week, we had a hearing.
The Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee had a hearing for the nomina-
tions of our new Ambassador to Saudi
Arabia, General John Abizaid, and our
new Ambassador to Iraq, a career Am-
bassador, Ambassador Tueller, a career
Foreign Service officer. That Ambas-
sador had just spent the last several
years as Ambassador to Yemen.
I had the honor of introducing Gen-
eral Abizaid at his confirmation hear-
ing just last week. He was the U.S.
Central Command commander. By the
way, he was the U.S. CENTCOM com-
mander when this spread of these IEDs
killing American soldiers started and
began. I happen to have been a Marine
Corps major, a staff officer to General
Abizaid for 11⁄2 years during this time.
I had the honor of introducing him.
This is an individual who is a great
American, by the way, who spent his
life in the Middle East. He retired as a
four-star general, speaks Arabic, has a
master’s degree from Harvard on Mid-
dle East studies, and was an Olmsted
scholar at the University of Amman in
Jordan. He knows a lot about this issue
that we are debating, as does Ambas-
sador Tueller, who had just spent the
last several years as the U.S. Ambas-
sador in Yemen. He is a career Foreign
Service officer who is getting ready to
go to Iraq as our Ambassador.
We have a lot of expertise here, but,
with all due respect to my Senate col-
leagues, these gentlemen have spent
their lives in the region. I am just
going to quote from a couple of the
questions and answers that came from
General Abizaid and Ambassador
Tueller on what is going on in the re-
gion.
Here is an important one. Ambas-
sador Tueller was asked about the hu-
manitarian crisis in Yemen. Remem-
ber, this is the current Ambassador to
Yemen—a very, very knowledgeable ca-
reer political officer, a career Foreign
Service officer. He said: But almost 100
percent of the humanitarian catas-
trophe in Yemen has been caused by
the Iranian-backed Houthis that over-
threw the Yemeni Government, de-
stroyed the institutions of state, and
caused approximately a 40-percent de-
cline in the GDP of the country.
Let me say that again. This is the
current Ambassador to Yemen, who is
getting ready to be Ambassador to
Iraq. He was asked who was respon-
sible. Right now, if you listen to the
Members of the Senate, it is all the
Saudis, and the Iranians have nothing
to do with it.
Here is a guy who knows more than
anybody, with all due respect to the
people in this body, on Yemen: One of
the things I often feel badly about is
because we have a relationship with
Saudi Arabia, and understandably, hold
them to a higher account. We do focus
on the consequences of Saudi actions.
That is what is going on in this debate
right now. But almost 100 percent of
the humanitarian catastrophe in
Yemen has been caused by the Iranian-
backed Houthis that overthrew the
government in 2015, destroyed the in-
stitutions of state, and caused approxi-
mately a 40-percent decline in the GDP
of the country.
He continued: I see very, very little
reporting, for example, of the millions
and millions of mines that the Houthis
have planted around the country, that
in fact have caused more civilian cas-
ualties and continue to cause civilian
casualties going into the future. That
is a great concern, and I think the
American people need to be concerned
about the humanitarian issues caused
by the Iranian-backed Houthis.
This is last week in the Senate For-
eign Relations committee. Now, you
wouldn’t know it in this debate be-
cause everybody is saying the whole
problem is Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia is a problem. They are
an ally. They are a difficult ally. They
are a complicated ally. But one of the
experts in our country on this issue
says that almost 100 percent of this is
the Iranian-backed Houthis who caused
the humanitarian crisis.
Let me just make a couple of more
points. This is General Abizaid. I see
the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee is on the floor, and I hope
he will talk to this because this was in
front of his committee. Iran and its
proxies want us out of the region.
By the way, that is what this resolu-
tion would help us do. This is General
Abizaid last week: They see that their
agenda is served by having the United
States disengaged and out to not
counter their malign influence. I think
it is very important that we work to
ensure that the relationship with Saudi
Arabia allows us to continue our influ-
ence in the region. I think, as we con-
tinue to apply pressure to them, what I
hope is that we can create conditions
with some of the elements to begin to
abandon sort of the Houthi ideological
project, a project that because it is an
Iranian project really in Yemen will
never bring stability to Yemen.
Again, what is going on here is that
the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen
are causing the humanitarian crisis.
The Iranian regime wants us out of the
region, including in Yemen, and the
U.S. Senate is getting ready to vote on
a resolution that does just that.
Again, the Ayatollahs are watching
this debate, and they are very pleased.
They are very pleased with what is
happening.
Let’s hear one more final thing that
General Abizaid said, again, in this
hearing just last week—a man who un-
derstands so much more about what is
going on in the region than my col-
leagues here on the Senate floor: One
thing we can’t afford in Yemen, we
can’t afford to withdraw U.S. expertise
to the coalition about how to fight.
He is talking about the Saudis.
He continued: Does anyone think
that if we leave and take our assist-
ance with regard to the Saudis, that is
going to help the humanitarian situa-
tion in Yemen?
The question almost answers itself,
and here is General Abizaid, the former
CENTCOM commander, at the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee just last
week, saying that is not a good idea: If
we want them, the Saudis, to fight
right, we need to continue to give them
that expertise.
That is exactly the opposite of what
this Senate resolution is getting ready
to do.

March 13, 2019
He continued: As far as competence
in military operations conducted by
the Saudi coalition, I think they have
much work to do. We all agree with
that. It is very important for us to con-
tinue to talk to them about the tar-
geting system—we all agree with
that—and about the way that they go
about hitting the various targets, and
about the professionalization of their
forces, and when mistakes are made,
that they do like what we do, which is
to convene a board of officers, talk
about the mistakes, and then take cor-
rective action necessary to gain better
and better expertise.
This is still General Abizaid, just last
week: I am hopeful that there is a way
to move forward with regard to easing
humanitarian problems in Yemen, and
that it will continue. And if I am con-
firmed—which we all hope he will be
very soon—will tell the Saudi Govern-
ment they need to do that.
But the former commander of U.S.
Central Command—and I spent 11⁄2
years with him in the region, seeing
him in action every day—emphatically
stated that if we don’t work with the
Saudis in terms of military assistance,
it is going to get worse.
The current Ambassador to Yemen
testified last week that almost 100 per-
cent of the humanitarian crisis in
Yemen is caused by the Houthi rebels
backed by the Iranians. Yet, if you lis-
ten to the debate today and if you lis-
ten to the debate 3 months ago on the
floor of the Senate, almost nobody
even talks about Iran.
So given that the experts believe this
strongly, given that they have more
knowledge—and they are not political;
one is a career four-star general, and
one is a career Foreign Service offi-
cer—and given that they think this is a
really bad idea to vote for this resolu-
tion, I am not sure how it advances
American interests. I am not sure how
it advances humanitarian interests in
Yemen, which we all want to advance.
It certainly will not advance the peace
process, which we all want to move for-
ward.
The only entity in the Middle East
that will be cheering a resolution in
support of American withdrawal with
regard to the Saudis is the biggest
state sponsor of terrorism in the re-
gion, and that is Iran. That is not just
me saying it. That is literally some of
the most prominent experts in the
country who have spent their lives fo-
cused on these issues.
I urge my colleagues to vote no on
this resolution that we are going to
take up here very soon.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Idaho.
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, first of
all, I want to associate myself with
those clear, concise comments of my
friend and colleague from the great
State of Alaska. He is absolutely right
from not only a military standpoint
but also from the standpoint of getting
this resolved through a political reso-
lution.
We are going to consider the Senate
joint resolution today, and it is a joint
resolution that directs removal of U.S.
Armed Forces from hostility in the
Yemen conflict unless authorized by
Congress. The premise of this resolu-
tion is fundamentally flawed.
Let’s start here, though. Every single
one of us—all 100 of us—can agree what
a horrible situation this is and what a
horrible catastrophe this is in Yemen.
But this resolution sets a bad prece-
dent for using the War Powers Act to
express political disagreements with a
President under expedited Senate
rules.
I want to start by making it abso-
lutely clear what is and what is not
happening with respect to our current
U.S. engagement in Yemen.
First of all, this is what isn’t hap-
pening. What is not happening is the
injection of U.S. troops into active hos-
tilities in Yemen. We are not doing
that.
What we are doing, however, is most
important. We provide limited, non-
combat support, including intelligence
sharing, and the practices that mini-
mize civilian casualties to the Saudi-
led coalition. This support is advisory
in nature and helps defend the terri-
torial integrity of the region, which
faces a very real threat from the Ira-
nians and the Iranian-backed Houthis.
This point can’t be understated. The
United States conducts war operations
entirely differently from any other
country on the face of the Earth, and it
is done with a direct and involved
method of minimizing civilian casual-
ties. Our presence here assists the par-
ties in conducting operations to mini-
mize those civilian casualties, and it is
badly needed there because there are
tremendous civilian casualties.
Iran’s support for the Houthis, nota-
bly the transfer of missiles and other
weaponry, threatens to undermine our
partners’ territorial integrity. It im-
perils key shipping routes and puts
U.S. interests at risk, including the
thousands of U.S. personnel and citi-
zens currently within the range of Ira-
nian-made missile systems under the
control of the Houthis. That said, there
can be no argument that after 4 long
years of conflict, Yemen, a country
with a long history of socioeconomic
challenges is now in the grip of the
world’s worst humanitarian crisis at
this moment. An estimated 24 mil-
lion—80 percent of the Yemeni popu-
lation—are in need of some kind of as-
sistance and 15.9 million people—more
than half of the country’s population—
remain severely food insecure.
A resolution to this conflict must be
found, and make no mistake, many of
us on a bipartisan basis are working
regularly every day to do everything
within our power to restore peace in a
country that has been ravaged by years
of proxy war and fractious infighting.
But we all recognize that lasting peace
can be achieved only through a polit-
ical settlement brokered by the U.N.
The U.N.-led peace talks are our best
bet for achieving peace in Yemen, and
they appear to be at a critical juncture
at this moment.
In the past, we have helped advance
the negotiations by using the support
we provide to the coalition as leverage
over the parties to advance the negoti-
ating process. In the past, parties have
been reluctant to take on the negoti-
ating process, but in the place we are
in, we have the ability to leverage
them to get there.
As this body considers ways to drive
effective U.S. policy that helps end the
war and relieves humanitarian suf-
fering in Yemen, I urge Members to
bear in mind that the U.N. negotia-
tions are our best hope for achieving
peace. We must do everything in our
power to advance this cause, and ad-
vancing this cause does not mean turn-
ing our backs on the negotiations and
on what is going on there at this time.
We need to stay engaged with the lim-
ited engagement that we have had.
The peace envoys have come to this
body and have testified over and over
again, and they are telling us they
want deeper U.S. engagement. Voting
for this resolution sends a terrible mes-
sage of U.S. division and lack of re-
solve. We need to send a signal and re-
solve that we are committed to playing
an important role in pushing for a sus-
tainable political settlement. As I stat-
ed, turning our backs at this critical
moment is only going to empower
them, and it is going to send a message
to people that they don’t need to nego-
tiate right now and that they are actu-
ally making gains.
I urge my colleagues to vote against
this at this time and give peace a
chance through the negotiations.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I want to be
very clear about a couple of things. No.
1, the fact that the word ‘‘hostilities’’—
Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield
for a parliamentary inquiry?
Mr. LEE. Yes, sir.
Mr. INHOFE. It was my under-
standing that before the vote on my
amendment, I would be recognized
prior to the vote for 1 minute or so. Is
that correct?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first
vote is on the Paul amendment, but
there are 2 minutes of debate, equally
divided, prior to this vote.
The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I need to
make a few points, and I say these with
great respect for my distinguished col-
leagues on the other side of this issue,
with great respect for my colleagues,
the Senator from Alaska and the Sen-
ator from Idaho, from whom we just
heard.
I must nonetheless insist on a couple
of points being made. No. 1, this tor-
tured definition of the word ‘‘hos-
tilities’’ that we have heard over and
over and over again is itself, No. 1, ri-
diculous and, No. 2, utterly at odds

with and irrelevant under the War
Powers Act.
The War Powers Act itself, in title 50
of the United States Code, section
1547(c), states in pertinent part that
‘‘For purposes of this chapter, the term
‘introduction of United States Armed
Forces’ includes the assignment of
members of such armed forces to com-
mand, coordinate, participate in the
movement of, or accompany the reg-
ular or irregular military forces of any
foreign country or government when
such military forces are engaged, or
there exists an imminent threat that
such forces will be engaged, in hos-
tilities.’’
There is absolutely no question here
that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia-led
coalition is involved in hostilities. No
one doubts that. No one tries to dress
it up in ridiculous language amounting
to anything other than what it is,
which is a war. It is also beyond dis-
pute that our U.S. Armed Forces are,
in fact, involved in the commanding,
the coordinating, the participating in
the movement of and the accom-
panying of those forces, as they them-
selves are engaged in hostilities.
Therefore, the War Powers Act is itself
implicated, and that matters.
Why? Well, because in the absence of
an act of Congress authorizing this, it
is unconstitutional for us to send our
brave young men and women into
harm’s way. It is unconstitutional and
unlawful for us to be involved in a war,
and, make no mistake, we are involved
in a war.
Next, we hear a lot about Iran—Iran
this and Iran that. I get that. I get that
some people in this Chamber really
like war or at least really like this
war. I get that some people in this
Chamber really distrust the regime in
Iran, and of that latter group, I count
myself among them. The regime in
charge of Iran is not a friend of the
United States and is, in fact, an enemy.
I do not understand—for the life of
me, I cannot comprehend how the fact
that the Iranian regime is an enemy to
the United States in any way, shape, or
form authorizes an unconstitutional
war effort, an undeclared war by the
United States in a civil war half a
world away in Yemen. It makes no
sense. It is a complete non sequitur.
So, look, if somebody wants to bring a
resolution declaring war on Iran, let’s
have that conversation. If somebody
wants to use military force in Iran or
anywhere else in the world—in
Yemen—let’s have that conversation
too.
Remember a few years ago, when
President Obama decided he wanted us
to go to war in Syria. At the time he
made that point, Congress reconvened.
I believe it was during a summer re-
cess. Congress came back. We had a lot
of discussions. A lot of us received clas-
sified briefings in the SCIF, and, ulti-
mately, Congress concluded: Let’s not
do that. We didn’t authorize that, but
that is, in fact, for Congress to decide.
That is, in fact, Congress’s decision.
The fact that Iran or the regime of
Iran may be an enemy of the United
States does not justify our going to
war in a civil war against the Houthi
rebels in Yemen. To suggest otherwise
makes no sense and shouldn’t carry the
day here.
Third, experts—we hear a lot of talk
about ‘‘experts.’’ I don’t care whether
general this, that, or the other or civil-
ian this, that, or the other in the Pen-
tagon or elsewhere in the executive
branch of the government thinks that
our going to war in somebody else’s
civil war half a world away makes
sense. I really don’t care. They don’t
hold this office.
I care in the sense that I will listen
to them; I care in the sense that their
opinion might be informative to us as
we exercise our constitutional author-
ity to decide whether we should go to
war. But it is a complete non sequitur
to suggest that general this, that, or
the other or somebody or other at the
Pentagon who is an ‘‘expert’’ thinks
that we should be in that war or that
we should somehow be able to cir-
cumvent the Constitution and the law
in order to go to war.
Finally, with respect to the sugges-
tion that this would somehow hinder
our involvement in international hu-
manitarian aid, that is completely in-
correct. That is not at all what this
resolution does. This resolution
wouldn’t do that.
What this resolution does is very
simple. It says that short of the U.S.
Congress’s declaring war or authorizing
the use of military force in the civil
war in Yemen, half a world away, we
shouldn’t be there, and we should get
out. I strongly urge my colleagues to
support this resolution.
Thank you.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would
like to discuss the situation in Yemen
and express my continued support for
the resolution that is currently before
us.
The conflict in Yemen is approaching
its 4th year and has resulted in the
most severe humanitarian crisis in the
world. The human cost of this war is
truly hard to fathom. According to the
United Nations, approximately 20 mil-
lion people—or more than two-thirds of
Yemen’s population—have no reliable
source of food or access to medical
care; roughly 10 million Yemenis are
on the brink of famine; more than 3.3
million Yemenis have been displaced
from their homes; and credible reports
indicate that approximately 80,000 chil-
dren have died of starvation and an-
other 360,000 children suffer from se-
vere acute malnutrition.
The international community must
come together to demand an end to the
violence in Yemen and a sustainable
political agreement. I strongly support
the efforts of the U.N. Special Envoy
for Yemen Martin Griffiths, in partner-
ship with the United States and other
engaged nations, to expeditiously nego-
tiate an end to the conflict and bring
relief to the Yemeni people. The De-
cember 2018 Stockholm Agreement and
resulting ceasefire around the port of
Hudaydah was a critical confidence
building measure that will hopefully
provide a foundation for continued ne-
gotiations.
I commend my colleagues Senators
SANDERS, MURPHY, and LEE for their
steadfast efforts to keep focus on the
suffering of the Yemeni people. As the
events of the last 4 years have made
clear, there is no military solution to
this civil war.
I remain deeply concerned about the
significant number of civilian casual-
ties that have resulted from airstrikes
by the Saudi-led coalition. I strongly
supported the decision last fall to cease
U.S. aerial refueling support to the co-
alition, an outcome I long advocated
for. It is appropriate for the U.S. to
help the coalition avoid civilian cas-
ualties, but those efforts have not yet
yielded sufficient results. Secretary
Pompeo acknowledged this fact when
he told Congress in September that
‘‘Recent civilian casualty incidents in-
dicate insufficient implementation of
reforms and targeting processes’’ and
‘‘Investigations have not yielded ac-
countability measures’’ into the behav-
ior of coalition pilots flying missions
into Yemen. It is clear that the coali-
tion has not sufficiently minimized the
impact of the war on Yemeni civilians,
and more must be done. The U.S.
should use all available leverage to af-
fect better outcomes.
The resolution before us would make
clear that Congress does not support
the introduction of U.S. forces into
hostilities in Yemen absent an affirma-
tive authorization for the use of mili-
tary force. I believe that any U.S. as-
sistance to members of the Saudi-led
coalition should be explicitly limited
to the following objectives: enabling
counterterrorism operations against al
Qaeda and ISIS; defending the terri-
torial integrity of Saudi Arabia and
UAE, including against specific, immi-
nent ballistic missile and UAV threats;
preserving freedom of navigation in the
maritime environment around Yemen;
and enhancing the training and profes-
sionalism of their armed forces with a
primary focus on the adherence to the
Law of Armed Conflict and the preven-
tion of civilian casualties. With par-
ticular regard to defense against bal-
listic missile and UAV threats, the
United States cannot be in the position
of providing targeting information in
Yemen that would be misused by the
Saudi-led coalition either deliberately
or through carelessness.
Continued U.S. engagement is crit-
ical to helping to resolve the conflict
in Yemen, but any assistance to the
Saudi-led coalition should be provided
in accordance with the principles out-
lined above, activities which I do not
believe conflict with the War Powers
Resolution. From a policy perspective,
the provision of U.S. support that
could be used to enable offensive oper-
ations against the Houthis runs
counter to our objective of ending the

civil war and risks exacerbating the
suffering of the Yemeni people. Beyond
the humanitarian crisis, the conflict
continues to negatively impact the
strategic security interests of the
United States, Saudi Arabia, and UAE,
including by emboldening Iran and re-
lieving pressure on al Qaeda and ISIS.
It is time for this war to end, and Con-
gress should take every opportunity to
make its voice clear on this point.
ORDER OF BUSINESS
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that Senator MENENDEZ’s
time be reserved; that all other re-
maining time be yielded back; and that
the Senate begin voting on the amend-
ments, as under the previous order.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
AMENDMENT NO. 193
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There
will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-
ly divided, prior to the vote in relation
to the Paul amendment no. 193.
Who yields time?
Mr. LEE. I yield back time.
Mr. SANDERS. We yield back time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all
time yielded back?
The question is on agreeing to the
amendment.
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 194
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There
are now 2 minutes of debate, equally
divided, prior to the vote in relation to
the Inhofe amendment.
The Senator from Oklahoma.
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have
heard a lot of controversy about this. I
think the main thing for me at this
late hour in relation to use of force—
ours is not that type of activity there.
We are on the outside. We are pro-
viding intelligence. We are not the tip
of the spear. We are not the inductee in
that type of action.
I would just say that if they are suc-
cessful in their efforts, then the loser
would be Israel. Iran would be the win-
ner, and the humanitarian situation
would be worse. I think most of us un-
derstand that.
The amendment we are talking about
right now is merely an amendment
that would put us in a position where,
if a ballistic missile or cruise missile
or UAV hits a population center and
kills Americans, because we, due to the
resolution, withheld intelligence, it
would be unforgiveable. I think we all
understand that. American lives could
be lost.
That is why I introduced an amend-
ment to specifically protect civilian
populations. I am talking about not
just other countries but our civilian
population. We all know the exposure
is there, and this would take that expo-

MOTION TO TABLE
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont.
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I
strongly oppose this amendment.
This amendment provides an excep-
tion to this resolution in support of ef-
forts to defend against threats to civil-
ian population centers in coalition
countries, including locations where
citizens and nationals of the United
States reside. But the President al-
ready has authority to support the de-
fense of U.S. partners and U.S. citizens
residing in those countries, so it sim-
ply duplicates the authorities the
President already has.
In the best interpretation, this
amendment is unnecessary, but this
amendment could also very easily be
used by the administration as a loop-
hole that will allow the Department of
Defense to continue the unauthorized
activities that the sponsors of this res-
olution are attempting to halt.
This resolution is intended to end
U.S. support for the Saudi war against
the Houthis in Yemen, support that has
not been authorized by Congress as the
Constitution requires. Under the lan-
guage of this amendment, the adminis-
tration could continue to wage that
war under different pretenses.
The goal of this resolution is to get
the United States out of a war. Senator
INHOFE’s amendment creates a pretext
to keep the United States in that war.
I urge my colleagues to vote against
it, and I move to table the Inhofe
amendment and ask for the yeas and
nays.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a
sufficient second?
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.
The clerk will call the roll.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Congress has the sole power to declare
war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the
United States Constitution.
(2) Congress has not declared war with re-
spect to, or provided a specific statutory au-
thorization for, the conflict between mili-
tary forces led by Saudi Arabia, including
forces from the United Arab Emirates, Bah-
rain, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Sen-
egal, and Sudan (the Saudi-led coalition),

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1836 March 13, 2019
(3) Since March 2015, members of the
United States Armed Forces have been intro-
duced into hostilities between the Saudi-led
coalition and the Houthis, including pro-
viding to the Saudi-led coalition aerial tar-
geting assistance, intelligence sharing, and
mid-flight aerial refueling.
(4) The United States has established a
Joint Combined Planning Cell with Saudi
Arabia, in which members of the United
States Armed Forces assist in aerial tar-
geting and help to coordinate military and
intelligence activities.
(5) In December 2017, Secretary of Defense
James N. Mattis stated, ‘‘We have gone in to
be very—to be helpful where we can in iden-
tifying how you do target analysis and how
you make certain you hit the right thing.’’.
(6) The conflict between the Saudi-led coa-
lition and the Houthis constitutes, within
the meaning of section 4(a) of the War Pow-
ers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)), either hos-
tilities or a situation where imminent in-
volvement in hostilities is clearly indicated
by the circumstances into which United
States Armed Forces have been introduced.
(7) Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states that ‘‘at any
time that United States Armed Forces are
engaged in hostilities outside the territory
of the United States, its possessions and ter-
ritories without a declaration of war or spe-
cific statutory authorization, such forces
shall be removed by the President if the Con-
gress so directs’’.
(8) Section 8(c) of the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1547(c)) defines the introduc-
tion of United States Armed Forces to in-
clude ‘‘the assignment of members of such
armed forces to command, coordinate, par-
ticipate in the movement of, or accompany
the regular or irregular military forces of
any foreign country or government when
such military forces are engaged, or there
exists an imminent threat that such forces
will become engaged, in hostilities,’’ and ac-
tivities that the United States is conducting
in support of the Saudi-led coalition, includ-
ing aerial refueling and targeting assistance,
fall within this definition.
(9) Section 1013 of the Department of State
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985
(50 U.S.C. 1546a) provides that any joint reso-
lution or bill to require the removal of
United States Armed Forces engaged in hos-
tilities without a declaration of war or spe-
cific statutory authorization shall be consid-
ered in accordance with the expedited proce-
dures of section 601(b) of the International
Security and Arms Export Control Act of
1976 (Public Law 94–329; 90 Stat. 765).
(10) No specific statutory authorization for
the use of United States Armed Forces with
respect to the conflict between the Saudi-led
coalition and the Houthis in Yemen has been
enacted, and no provision of law explicitly
authorizes the provision of targeting assist-
ance or of midair refueling services to war-
planes of Saudi Arabia or the United Arab
Emirates that are engaged in such conflict.
SEC. 2. REMOVAL OF UNITED STATES ARMED
FORCES FROM HOSTILITIES IN THE
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN THAT HAVE
NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED BY CON-
GRESS.
Pursuant to section 1013 of the Department
of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984
and 1985 (50 U.S.C. 1546a) and in accordance
with the provisions of section 601(b) of the
International Security Assistance and Arms
Export Control Act of 1976 (Public Law 94–
329; 90 Stat. 765), Congress hereby directs the
President to remove United States Armed
Forces from hostilities in or affecting the
Republic of Yemen, except United States
Armed Forces engaged in operations directed
at al Qaeda or associated forces, by not later
than the date that is 30 days after the date
of the enactment of this joint resolution (un-
less the President requests and Congress au-
thorizes a later date), and unless and until a
declaration of war or specific authorization
for such use of United States Armed Forces
has been enacted. For purposes of this reso-
lution, in this section, the term ‘‘hostilities’’
includes in-flight refueling of non-United
States aircraft conducting missions as part
of the ongoing civil war in Yemen.
SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REGARDING
CONTINUED MILITARY OPERATIONS
AND COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL.
Nothing in this joint resolution shall be
construed to influence or disrupt any mili-
tary operations and cooperation with Israel.
SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REGARDING IN-
TELLIGENCE SHARING.
Nothing in this joint resolution may be
construed to influence or disrupt any intel-
ligence, counterintelligence, or investigative
activities relating to threats in or ema-
nating from Yemen conducted by, or in con-
junction with, the United States Govern-
ment involving—
(1) the collection of intelligence;
(2) the analysis of intelligence; or
(3) the sharing of intelligence between the
United States and any coalition partner if
the President determines such sharing is ap-
propriate and in the national security inter-
ests of the United States.
SEC. 5. REPORT ON RISKS POSED BY CEASING
SAUDI ARABIA SUPPORT OPER-
ATIONS.
Not later than 90 days after the date of the
enactment of this joint resolution, the Presi-
dent shall submit to Congress a report as-
sessing the risks posed to United States citi-
zens and the civilian population of Saudi
Arabia and the risk of regional humanitarian
crises if the United States were to cease sup-
port operations with respect to the conflict
between the Saudi-led coalition and the
Houthis in Yemen.
SEC. 6. REPORT ON INCREASED RISK OF TER-
RORIST ATTACKS TO UNITED
STATES ARMED FORCES ABROAD,
ALLIES, AND THE CONTINENTAL
UNITED STATES IF SAUDI ARABIA
CEASES YEMEN-RELATED INTEL-
LIGENCE SHARING WITH THE
UNITED STATES.
Not later than 90 days after the date of the
enactment of this joint resolution, the Presi-
dent shall submit to Congress a report as-
sessing the increased risk of terrorist at-
tacks on United States Armed Forces
abroad, allies, and to the continental United
States if the Government of Saudi Arabia
were to cease Yemen-related intelligence
sharing with the United States.
SEC. 7. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REGARDING NO
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILI-
TARY FORCE.
Consistent with section 8(a)(1) of the War
Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1547(a)(1)),
nothing in this joint resolution may be con-
strued as authorizing the use of military
force.

MORNING BUSINESS
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the Senate be

Senators permitted to speak therein
for up to 10 minutes each.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
MOBILE MAMMA
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on
behalf of my constituent, Christy
Teslow, I ask unanimous consent to
have printed in the RECORD informa-
tion about a program she founded to
help educate children of all ages about
the importance of being a good digital
citizen.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
Mobile Mamma is a non-profit organiza-
tion which was founded in 2017 in Cresco,
Iowa. We are 6 moms who are working pro-
fessionals that use a common-sense approach
to educate about the impact of technology.
We personally have children ranging in age
from kindergarten to college and wanted to
be better educated about using devices of
daily use, with the common goal to keep our
children safe and secure while being online.
From our own research, we felt compelled to
design a curriculum to share with students
and adults of all ages.
Statement of the Problem. Children today
are so self-reliant on their mobile devices
which in turn has caused a social disconnect
with society. Children are more concerned
with their ‘‘e-reputation’’ and not as much of
what their real-life reputation is. Parents
have an ethical and moral role to provide
children with online safety. The problem is,
children are not safe online and parents are
unaware of the detrimental dangers, harms,
and effects of social media.
Conceptual Framework. Clear and concise
communication about parents’ expectations
are especially important. Research has dem-
onstrated that teens, whose parents use ef-
fective monitoring practices, are less likely
to make poor decisions such as having sex at
a young age, smoking, using illegal drugs,
drinking alcohol, being physically aggres-
sive, or skipping school (Center for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2012). Teens who be-
lieve their parents disapprove of risky be-
haviors are less likely to participate in these
behaviors. Teens rely on their parents and
other adults in their daily lives for informa-
tion about online safety. In 2013, a study by
the Center for Disease Control and Preven-
tion titled ‘‘Adolescents, Technology, and
Reducing Risk for HIV, STDs, and Preg-
nancy’’, a participant stated ‘‘I multitask
every second I am online. At this very mo-
ment, I am watching TV, checking my email
every two minutes, reading a newsgroup
about who shot JFK, burning some music to
a CD, and writing this message’’ (a 17-year-
old male). According to Farrukh, Sadwick,
and Villasenor (2014), parents seek informa-
tion on how to best protect children online
through various channels. Parents utilize
general news media 38% of the time, other
parents 37%, and school teachers 29%.
Statement of the Purpose. The purpose of
the Be a B.E.A.R. program is to educate chil-
dren of all ages about the importance of
being a good digital citizen. The Be a
B.E.A.R. curriculum is designed to teach
children from kindergarten through high
school about what is acceptable to portray
on social media and what is not acceptable.
The intention of the Be a B.E.A.R. program
is not only designed for children but can be
applied to adults as well. The purpose of the
program is to gain a positive structured ap-
proach to handling online situations.
Significance of the Program. There is an
ethical and moral responsibility of schools
and adults that give these devices to chil-
dren, to properly educate themselves and
their children. With the rising mental health
crisis, not only in Iowa but across the Na-
tion, the devices of daily living (also known
as Smartphones, tablets, etc) are causing
these issues. Some of these issues include:
low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, sadness,
sleeplessness, and paranoia. Due to the men-
tal health concerns, if we can get this pro-
gram in schools it will help give a positive

use to technology by determining what a
good digital footprint and digital citizen are.
This program continues to educate both par-
ents and children about cybersecurity/safety,
the potential harms and dangers associated
with the evolving virtual environment, and
discusses in detail about the responsibility
needed by all ages when it comes to the con-
stant influx of technology in our children’s
lives. With the increasing suicide rates,
there is a direct correlation between human
trafficking, cyberbullying, and sexting that
are negatively impacting society.
DEFINITION OF TERMS
Good digital citizen: While online por-
traying yourself as a positive person and
using appropriate etiquette
Good digital footprint: Leaving positive
markers when using the internet and social
media sites
B.E.A.R.:
B = breathe, stop and take a breath before
reacting to a situation that may cause you
negative feelings
E = explain to the other person or parties
how the negative behaviors that are being
portrayed are impacting you personally
A = affirm actions, your choice is to walk
away, block the other party on social media,
and ignore
R = report the unwanted behavior to a
trusted adult such as parents, teachers, or
counselors.
Timeline. Currently, we are involved with
two Northeast Iowa School Districts. We are
using a 7-week program to educate the stu-
dents in the following grades kindergarten,
third, sixth, eighth, and eleventh about the
Be a B.E.A.R. program. Each student has
completed a pre-test about the different ob-
jectives that are covered in the core cur-
riculum. After completion of the program
there will be a post-test administered to de-
termine the learning curve of the students.
Currently, we do not have substantial re-
sults because of the initiation phase we are
in. After the completion of our 7-week pro-
gram we will have results to support our
statement of intent.
Conclusion. By implementing these steps
of the Be a B.E.A.R. program with children
and adults, we can bring positivity and edu-
cation while being safe online.
f
GUATEMALA
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the
past dozen years, the International
Commission against Impunity in Gua-
temala, with financial support from
the United States and other countries,
has worked in collaboration with Gua-
temala’s Public Ministry. That part-
nership has enabled courageous Guate-
malan prosecutors to investigate and
bring to trial cases they never could
have pursued without the international
‘‘shield’’ and assistance provided by
CICIG. It has also enabled courageous
constitutional court magistrates to de-
fend Guatemala’s weak judicial insti-
tutions. In a country where throughout
its history high-ranking public offi-
cials, including senior military offi-
cers, and corporate elites have enjoyed
near total impunity for corrupt acts
and violent crimes, the Guatemalan
people finally saw that justice is pos-
sible.
Not surprisingly, that collaboration
encountered fierce opposition from its
inception. The same high-ranking offi-
cials and elites who feared becoming
the targets of corruption investiga-
tions sought to curtail CICIG’s role.
Last year, that opposition culminated
in President Morales expelling the
CICIG commissioner and subsequently
announcing that the agreement estab-
lishing CICIG would be terminated, ef-
fective immediately. That announce-
ment was made, without warning, after
months of negotiations between Guate-
malan, UN, and U.S. officials on re-
forms requested by the Morales govern-
ment, which would have established
the position of Deputy Commissioner
as well as certain reporting and over-
sight requirements.
In response to that announcement, as
well as other worrisome trends in Gua-
temala, last week Senator CARDIN and
I, along with Representatives TORRES
and MCGOVERN, introduced legislation
in the Senate and House entitled the
‘‘Guatemala Rule of Law Account-
ability Act.’’ Its purpose is to respond
to the flagrant actions by the Morales
government to subvert the rule of law,
including its campaign against CICIG.
In fact, the Morales government
lacks authority to unilaterally curtail
an agreement with the United Nations,
a point that was made clear by the UN
Secretary General. CICIG’s mandate
continues in effect until September
2019, at which point it may or may not
be renewed. However, I am concerned
that there are some, including at the
UN, who believe CICIG should signifi-
cantly reduce its activities and, for all
intents and purposes, fade into the sun-
set. This would mean that, for the re-
maining 6 months of its current man-
date, CICIG personnel would no longer
attend trials or engage in further in-
vestigations. Essentially, CICIG would
discontinue its public activities and its
personnel would be limited to pre-
paring for the shutdown that would
presumably occur in September.
This is extremely worrisome for sev-
eral reasons. First, donors would be
paying to simply keep the lights on.
Second, CICIG would cease to function
half a year before the end of its man-
date. This would be an enormous waste
of time and resources that could be
used to continue pursuing important
cases and to ensure their proper hand-
off to the public ministry. Third, it
would send a terrible message to the
Guatemalan people, especially to the
families of the victims.
CICIG’s work under Commissioner
Ivan Velazquez has been important not
only for Guatemala, but for all of Cen-
tral America. There are still many
cases under investigation. Abandoning
these cases would be a grave mistake.
It would signal that the Morales gov-
ernment’s tactics of intimidation and
obstruction of justice paid off. It would
undermine future anticorruption ef-
forts in Guatemala, as well as send a
terrible message to anticorruption ef-
fort’s in Honduras and fledgling efforts
in El Salvador. The United Nations and
the international community have a
responsibility to do everything possible
to prevent this result.
On a related topic, the Guatemalan
Congress is about to debate, for the
third and final time, legislation to
grant amnesty to former military per-
sonnel who are charged with or con-
victed of war crimes and crimes
against humanity. If the amnesty leg-
islation is approved, those serving pris-
on sentences will reportedly be re-
leased within 24 hours. The Guate-
malan Congress has long had a reputa-
tion for being corrupt, and absolving
military officers who engaged in hei-
nous crimes is clearly a payoff to ob-
struct justice and undermine the rule
of law.
We remember that Guatemala was
ravaged by three decades of an internal
armed conflict that included crimes of
genocide. An estimated 200,000 people,
mostly rural Mayan villagers, were
killed, and, according to the United
Nations, more than 90 percent of those
killings were committed by the army.
The peace accords that ended that dis-
aster were never implemented, and for
decades, the victims of those crimes
were denied justice. Now the Guate-
malan Congress, with the support of
President Morales, is on the verge of
adding insult to injury by freeing the
few army officers who were sent to
prison. If that happens, the Guate-
malan Government will join other pa-
riah governments that fail to uphold
their most sacred obligation to provide
security and justice for their citizens.
f
SAUDI ARABIA
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has
been more than 5 months since jour-
nalist and American resident Jamal
Khashoggi was tortured and murdered
inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
More than 5 months since the Saudi
Government initially denied it had
anything to do with Mr. Khashoggi’s
disappearance and told the world, in a
calculated and quickly disproven lie,
that he left the consulate unharmed.
As the Saudi Government’s com-
plicity became clear, its explanations
became even more convoluted. We were
told to accept that the operation that
resulted in Mr. Khashoggi’s death was
an interrogation gone wrong, carried
out by rogue agents who somehow flew
to Istanbul, executed Mr. Khashoggi,
and worked with a local collaborator to
cover up the crime, all, despite their
ties to the highest levels of govern-
ment, without the knowledge of the
Crown Prince. Although Senators—Re-
publicans and Democrats—who have
been briefed on the matter found that
possibility preposterous, President
Trump and Secretary Pompeo seemed
ready to accept the Saudi Govern-
ment’s lies.
The truth is that, while there is a
mountain of information circulating in
the press that suggests the Crown
Prince was involved in the planning
and approval of the assassination of
Mr. Khashoggi, there are still many
unanswered questions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1838 March 13, 2019
We know the Saudi Government iden-
tified certain Saudi officials who alleg-
edly carried out this murder, but we do
not know how they were identified,
what these officials were asked, by
whom, and what they have said about
the crime, or why some of them were
brought to trial and others were not.
We know that the Trump administra-
tion sanctioned 17 Saudi officials, but
we have not been told to what extent
or why these individuals were targeted
for sanctions and others were not. We
know that there was a local collabo-
rator, but we have not been told his na-
tionality or identity, nor the where-
abouts of Mr. Khashoggi’s body, which
has not been returned to his family.
What do we know? We know that the
Saudi Government—the royal family—
is sticking to the latest version of its
story, absolving itself of any culpa-
bility. The Trump administration
maintains, despite many mixed signals,
that it is doing everything in its power
to ensure Mr. Khashoggi’s murderers
are held accountable for their actions.
If that is true, we would expect the
administration to be transparent and
to cooperate with the Congress.
But while I would like to be per-
suaded of their commitment to pur-
suing justice in this case, their efforts
to date have been anything but con-
vincing. On October 10, 2018, Senators
Corker, MENENDEZ, GRAHAM, and I,
along with a majority of the members
of the Foreign Relations Committee,
sent a letter to the President to trigger
a 120-day review and determination on
the imposition of sanctions pursuant to
the Global Magnitsky Human Rights
Accountability Act with respect to any
foreign person involved in the murder
of Mr. Khashoggi. The response of the
administration has been to ignore the
legal requirement to make that deter-
mination. This is only the latest at-
tempt by the administration to ob-
struct the Congress’s access to infor-
mation about this crime.
Rather than ignoring its legal obliga-
tions and keeping Congress in the dark,
the administration should be working
with Congress and the international
community, to expose the truth about
who gave the orders to kill Mr.
Khashoggi. If the administration has
nothing to hide, then they have noth-
ing to lose and everything to gain by
being part of the effort to see justice
done.
One way for the administration to
prove it is serious about accountability
is to fully cooperate with the UN Spe-
cial Rapporteur on extrajudicial, sum-
mary or arbitrary executions, who is
reviewing the evidence in the
Khashoggi case. The White House, the
State Department, and our intelligence
agencies should promptly provide her
with any relevant information in their
possession.
As I stated on February 3, 2019, if the
President continues to take actions
such as ignoring the clear mandate of
the Magnitsky Act or otherwise refuses
to cooperate with the investigations of
this murder, the White House will
share the blame for attempting to
cover up the crime and for helping
those responsible to evade justice.
The administration should also urge
the Saudi Government to guarantee a
fair and public trial for the men ac-
cused of being involved in the killing of
Mr. Khashoggi, that meets inter-
national standards of due process. A
trial that fails to disclose all of the
facts—a trial that is rushed and secre-
tive—will be seen as simply further ob-
struction of justice. Real account-
ability must occur in this case.
We know all too well that Mr.
Khashoggi’s murder is only one exam-
ple of the brutal way in which the
Saudi Government, led by the Crown
Prince, treats anyone it perceives as a
threat, which means anyone who dares
criticize the government or who advo-
cates for human rights.
Since May 2018, prominent women’s
rights advocates have been imprisoned
and tortured by the Saudi Government
or banned from traveling, without any
criminal charges being brought—
women like 25-year-old Loujain al-
Hathloul, who had a driver’s license
from the United Arab Emirates and ad-
vocated for the right of Saudi women
to drive, but was arrested in a sweeping
crackdown on women’s activists just
before the Saudi Government lifted the
ban on female drivers. Dr. Hatoon al-
Fassi, another women’s rights advocate
and a history professor, was arrested in
June 2018 and remains confined to this
day. While these women have not been
charged, their so-called crime is obvi-
ous: engaging in independent activism.
The royal family will do whatever it
takes to make clear that they alone
can create change in Saudi Arabia.
That is why, like these women, any-
one of influence, including average
citizens who advocate for reforms, is at
risk in Saudi Arabia. It is not only op-
position that the Crown Prince fears, it
is the appearance of capitulation to or-
dinary citizens that he seeks to avoid
by cracking down on those who are
merely advocating for reforms he him-
self claims to support. His repression
has touched every segment of society,
from journalists to women’s rights ad-
vocates to economists like Dr. Essam
al-Zamil, who was detained in Sep-
tember 2017, presumably due to his op-
position to the Crown Prince’s econom-
ics plan, and Mohammad Fahad al-
Qahtani, an economics professor and
human rights activist who was sen-
tenced in 2013 to 10 years in prison for
breaking allegiance with the royal
family and defaming the judiciary.
Sometimes the motivation behind
the Crown Prince’s actions is a com-
plete mystery. One egregious case is
that of Dr. Walid Fitaihi, a U.S. citizen
who earned his medical degree from
George Washington University and a
master’s degree in public health from
Harvard University. Dr. Fitaihi was
seized by Saudi authorities for un-
known reasons in November 2017. He
has reportedly been severely tortured,
and he remains in prison. In fact, be-
fore Mr. Khashoggi was murdered, he
wrote about Dr. Fitaihi’s detention on
social media to decry the arbitrary and
repressive trends developing under the
Crown Prince’s rule. Like Jamal
Khashoggi, there is not a shred of evi-
dence that Dr. Fitaihi is guilty of any-
thing. He should be released imme-
diately. I ask unanimous consent that
a copy of the March 4, 2019, editorial in
the Washington Post, entitled, ‘‘Saudi
Arabia is torturing a U.S. citizen.
When will Trump Act?’’ which high-
lights Mr. Fitaihi’s case, be printed in
the RECORD following my remarks.
These cases are only a fraction of the
known examples of the Crown Prince’s
repression. There are countless others
that don’t escape the royal family’s
tight control of information in the
country. This is the so-called reformer
we are told to put our trust in to help
lead Saudi Arabia into the future. As
others in this body have said, he is no
reformer; he is an impulsive, ruthless
gangster. It would be naive not to
think that the Crown Prince’s actions
will lead to greater public resentment
and instability in Saudi Arabia and
jeopardize our long-term interests in
the region. Contrary to the thinking of
the White House, no amount of arms
sales and no amount of oil can change
that reality.
I urge all Senators to join me in urg-
ing the White House and in supporting
legislative action as appropriate to
protect our national interests by en-
suring that United States relations
with Saudi Arabia are guided, first and
foremost, by our principles and, most
importantly, by our commitment to
the rule of law.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the Washington Post, Mar. 4, 2019]
SAUDI ARABIA IS TORTURING A U.S. CITIZEN.
WHEN WILL TRUMP ACT?
(By Editorial Board)
Before he was murdered inside a Saudi
Consulate in October, our colleague Jamal
Khashoggi questioned why Saudi Arabia had
detained a prominent doctor, Walid Fitaihi,
a dual Saudi-U.S. citizen seized in a Novem-
ber 2017 roundup of businessmen. The detain-
ees, in what was described as an anti-corrup-
tion drive, were held at the Ritz-Carlton
hotel in Riyadh. ‘‘What happened to us?’’
Khashoggi, himself a Saudi, asked on Twit-
ter. ‘‘How can a person like @Walidfitaihi
get arrested, and for what reason?’’ He
added, ‘‘With no interceding channels to pur-
sue & no Attorney General to answer ques-
tions & verify charges, of course everyone is
struck with awe and helplessness.’’
Today, Khashoggi is no longer able to ask
such impertinent questions. He was assas-
sinated in Istanbul by a hit squad that intel-
ligence reports say was dispatched by the
Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.
But Khashoggi’s question remains relevant.
Mr. Fitaihi, founder of a medical center in
Jeddah, is still a captive. It is not known
precisely why, and he has never been
charged, although the New York Times
quoted a friend saying he was being pres-
sured to give evidence against a relative.
He has been tortured during his captivity.
He was reportedly grabbed from his room at

the Ritz, slapped, blindfolded, stripped to his
underwear, bound to a chair, shocked with
electricity and whipped so severely that he
could not sleep on his back for days. The
Times said his lawyer has written to the
State Department that the doctor ‘‘is in fear
for his life, that he cannot take his situation
any longer, and that he desires all possible
help.’’ The Associated Press quoted the law-
yer as saying Mr. Fitaihi is now in a prison
hospital after suffering ‘‘an emotional break-
down.’’ Mr. Fitaihi earned his medical degree
from George Washington University and
holds a master’s degree in public health from
Harvard University.
On another front in Mohammed bin
Salman’s drive to crush critical voices,
Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor announced
charges Friday against a group of female ac-
tivists who campaigned to give women the
right to drive—a right that Mohammed bin
Salman conferred after they sought it. The
activists have been jailed for nearly a year,
during which Amnesty International says
they have been tortured and sexually abused.
They did nothing wrong and should be re-
leased unconditionally and immediately.
In the New York Times Magazine on Sun-
day, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, asked
about the crown prince’s role in the
Khashoggi murder, declared that the United
States would ‘‘hold everyone that we deter-
mine is responsible for this accountable in
an appropriate way, a way that reflects the
best of the United States of America.’’
A doctor with U.S. citizenship was tortured
and held without charge. Women who stood
for human dignity and equality were jailed
and tortured. A journalist was killed. Yet
President Trump and his administration—in-
cluding his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who
last week met with the crown prince—are
loath to act. That does not reflect the best of
the United States of America.

Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
I oppose amendment No. 193 to S.J.

INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I
wish to commemorate International
Women’s Day, which occurred this past
Friday, March 8, 2019. On this day each
year, we recognize and celebrate wom-
en’s incredible achievements and dou-
ble down on our commitment to ad-
vance gender equality and women’s em-
powerment, both at home and abroad.
The theme of International Women’s
Day this year is ‘‘Think equal, build
smart, innovate for change,’’ which
highlights the importance of finding
new ways to advance gender equality,
especially by utilizing technology. In
January of this year, President Trump
signed a bill Senator BOOZMAN and I
sponsored, the Women’s Entrepreneur-
ship and Economic Empowerment Act,
WEEE Act, into law. This important,
bipartisan legislation allows women
around the world, including those liv-
ing in poverty, to access critical tools
to start and grow their businesses. It
requires that 50 percent of U.S. Agency
for International Development’s micro,
small, and medium-sized enterprise re-
sources are targeted to activities that
reach the very poor, as well as enter-
prises women own, manage, and con-
trol. The WEEE Act empowers women
to invest in themselves, their families,
and their communities.
A McKinsey Global Institute report
estimates that achieving global gender
parity in economic activity could add
as much as $28 trillion to annual global
gross domestic product by 2025. The
WEEE Act will help women overcome
the critical barriers they face when
seeking economic opportunity and the
legislation will open doors for children,
families, and communities to benefit,
too.
This year’s theme of ‘‘Think equal,
build smart, innovate for change’’ also
provides the opportunity to celebrate
some of the incredible and life-chang-
ing innovations being launched around
the world. In Cambodia, for example,
CARE has developed a gamified mobile
app called ‘‘Chat!’’ to provide cost-ef-
fective and high-impact reproductive
health education to its young, female
population working in the garment in-
dustry. Cambodia has the largest youth
and adolescent population in Southeast
Asia; two-thirds of the population are
under the age of 29. Increasing numbers
of Cambodians, especially young
women, are migrating to urban areas
to support its garment industry.
According to CARE, 85 percent of
Cambodia’s garment factory workers
are women, who are vulnerable to
abuse and exploitation. According to
the United Nations’ research on
women, one in three women are likely
to face violence in her lifetime. There-
fore, applications like Chat! are crit-
ical to reach this population and pro-
vide reproductive health information
and services, helping these women
make informed and healthy choices
and prevent unplanned pregnancies.
While International Women’s Day
provides the opportunity to celebrate
such successes, it is also critically im-
portant to recognize the work that lies
ahead in the fight for gender equality,
and especially the challenges that fe-
male human rights defenders face in
this fight. A recent United Nations re-
port on human rights defenders de-
scribes increased resistance to the
work of female human rights defenders
at multiple levels, linked to the rise of
populism, fundamentalism, and violent
extremism around the world.
The report highlights the increasing
number of countries that are actively
restricting fundamental human rights,
including the freedoms of expression,
association, and assembly, and specifi-
cally notes the enforced disappearances
of female defenders in Saudi Arabia.
Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sadah,
for example, were arrested last summer
for advocating to lift the ban on female
drivers and end the guardianship sys-
tem that prevents women from legal
and social independence. Amal al-Harbi
was also arrested last summer for ad-
vocating for the release of her husband,
Fowzan al-Harbi, a human rights de-
fender. These female human rights de-
fenders remain detained to this day,
and several of these activists are due to
appear in Saudi court this week. With
no access to legal representation, I and
many of my colleagues fear that these
activists will be charged and tried for
crimes they did not commit, as a result
of engaging in peaceful activities to ad-
vance human rights in Saudi Arabia,
which are protected under inter-
national law.
The reduction in funding for women’s
rights in recent years is also an im-
mense challenge to future progress, a
challenge exasperated by the Trump
administration’s actions, particularly
in the realm of women’s health. The
Trump administration’s reinstatement
and expansion of the Mexico City pol-
icy, often referred to as the Global Gag
Rule, for example, has closed the door
on some of the most effective, life-
saving family planning programs by
disqualifying international organiza-
tions from receiving U.S. family plan-
ning assistance if any non-U.S. funds
are used to provide abortion services or
counseling. The implementation of this
expanded policy, as the aforementioned
UN report notes, has ‘‘threatened the
integration of health services and cre-
ated division in civil society around
the world.’’ As underscored by the ex-
ample of Chat!, we know that family
planning tools are critical to providing
the education, information, and serv-
ices that help prevent unplanned preg-
nancies and abortions.
As I have stated in the past, Amer-
ica’s global leadership begins with our
progress here in the United States.
This also extends into the realm of
gender equality. A critical challenge to
progress here at home is the fact that
our own Constitution does not already
guarantee women the same rights and
protections as men. The Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution guar-
antees ‘‘equal protection of the laws,’’
and the Supreme Court, so far, has held
that most sex or gender classifications
are subject to only ‘‘intermediate scru-
tiny’’ when analyzing laws that may
have a discriminatory impact. Ratifi-
cation of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment, ERA, by State legislatures
would provide the courts with clearer
guidance in holding gender or sex clas-
sifications to the ‘‘strict scrutiny’’
standard. That is why on January 25,
2019, Senator MURKOWSKI and I intro-
duced a resolution to immediately re-
move the ratification deadline and re-
open consideration of the ERA for rati-
fication by the States and finally guar-
antee full and equal protections to
women in the Constitution.
While we have much to celebrate on
this day, I want to take this oppor-
tunity to remind my colleagues in the
U.S. Senate that we must continue to
use our leadership positions to shine a
spotlight on human rights violations,
wherever they occur, and push for the

Gag Rule once and for all, and we must

powerment, so that we can pave the
path towards prosperity for genera-
tions to come.
f
CENTENNIAL OF THE
THERMOPOLIS CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President,
today I wish to celebrate the centen-
nial of the Thermopolis, WY, Chamber
of Commerce.
On March 23, the Thermopolis Cham-
ber of Commerce celebrates their 100th
anniversary at an annual banquet.
What was once called the old
Thermopolis Commercial Club incor-
porated in Hot Springs County as the
Thermopolis Chamber of Commerce on
February 4, 1919.
The future of the chamber was en-
trusted to elected directors: President
Guy J. Gay, Vice President C.C. Bea-
ver, and Directors Peter Sill, I.W.
Wright, Harris Woods, A.W. Harrigan,
and C.E. Stewart. Their guidance laid
the foundation for a chamber that con-
tinues to foster the growth of business
and sense of community in
Thermopolis.
In an article dated February 7, 1919,
the Thermopolis Independent Record
wrote of the intended mission of the
new chamber of commerce. ‘‘We wish
to create better business, better homes,
better government, a better commu-
nity and, in general, create a better
brotherhood of man. We ask only what
is fair. All who live here are the owners
of our community and our community
is our biggest asset.’’
This spirit has driven Wyoming’s
people, businesses, and communities
since its inception and will continue
for generations to come. To further ex-
pand the chamber’s embrace of commu-
nity, on November 13, 1987, the
Thermopolis Chamber of Commerce
passed a resolution to change its name
to the Thermopolis Hot Springs Cham-
ber of Commerce. This combined all of
Hot Spring County’s corner of the Big
Horn Basin into the chamber’s mission.
The citizens of Thermopolis and Hot
Springs County are blessed to live in a
beautiful environment. Located in
northern Wyoming and nestled on the
world’s largest mineral hot spring,
Thermopolis is bordered by the Hot
Springs State Park and the Wind River
Canyon. The Owl Creek Mountains lie
to the South while the Absaroka Range
is to the West. The hot springs have
been free to the public since purchase
of the land from Native Americans in
1896.
The construction of the railroad had
a major impact on the development of
Hot Springs County. In 1910, the Bur-
lington Railroad reached Thermopolis
from the north. In 1911, the Burlington
completed its line through Wind River
Canyon to the south. This gave the en-
tire Bighorn Basin much better connec-
tions with the rest of Wyoming. On
February 9, 1911, the legislature ap-
proved establishment of Hot Springs
County with Thermopolis as county
seat. County government was orga-
nized in January 1913. The Thermopolis
Chamber of Commerce was organized
just a few years later in an office on
South 5th Street.
For 100 years, the hard-working peo-
ple at the chamber welcomed visitors
to the area. One of today’s main at-
tractions is the rich prehistoric areas
of Hot Springs County. The Wyoming
Dinosaur Center offers a professional
paleontological experience for the
whole family. The center is an impres-
sive 16,000-square-foot complex. It in-
cludes a world-class museum, working
dig sites, and a modern preparation
laboratory. Interpretive dig site tours
allow visitors to walk the same ground
as ancient dinosaurs and watch as sci-
entists recover fossils from burial sites.
Hot Springs County as we know it
today is vastly different from 100 years
ago. It is this shared history between
today’s residents and those of the past
that creates a special bond. Under di-
rection and guidance from the chamber
board of directors, executive director
Meri Ann Rush and two office assist-
ants, Kailey Dvorak and Kymberlee
Oliver, continue the traditions of pro-
moting Wyoming’s people, businesses,
and communities, started by the cham-
ber 100 years ago. chamber board mem-
bers are president Deb Tudor, vice
president Pastor Sam Needham, treas-
urer Vivian Butchart, secretary Susan
Linko, past president Greg Willson,
Phillip Scheel, Barb Heinze, Robin
Griffin, Kerri Manig, Amanda
Kraushaar, Lana Nicodemus, Shelly
Burrows, and middle school representa-
tive Jackson Reed.
In honor of the centennial of the
Thermopolis Hot Springs County
Chamber of Commerce, I invite my col-
leagues to see this wonderful place in
person. Thermopolis is the hometown
of my wife Bobbi and her brother Mike.
Her parents, Bob and Jerry Brown, con-
tinue to live there today. Bob served
Thermopolis as the longtime post-
master, as well as in World War 2 and
the Korean war. Jerry owned a store
downtown.
It is a great privilege to recognize
this remarkable organization advanc-
ing Wyoming business and tourism.
Bobbi joins me in extending our con-
gratulations and gratitude to the
Thermopolis Hot Springs Chamber of
Commerce on their centennial celebra-
tion.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO GERALD KOTKOWSKI
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, when
Gerald Kotkowski of Hampton, NH,
was preparing for retirement, he knew
he would have more time on his hands
and wanted to find a way to give back
to his community. Inspired by his own
life experiences, Gerald chose to serve
as a volunteer driver to help people un-
dergoing cancer treatment, as well as
those who experience visual impair-
ments. Since he started working with
both Future in Sight and the American
Cancer Society, Gerald has provided
more than 400 rides to his fellow Gran-
ite Staters in need. For his incredible
volunteerism, I am proud to recognize
him as March 2019’s Granite Stater of
the Month.
Gerald began driving people under-
going cancer treatment after he heard
about the program from a coworker.
The cause, he said, touched him be-
cause of his own experiences; he and
his wife both have had cancer scares,
and their daughter was diagnosed with
leukemia as a child. While his daughter
has thankfully been cancer-free for
over two decades, he still remembers
the impact that the diagnosis had on
his family. Gerald also provides rides
to Granite Staters who experience vis-
ual impairments through Future in
Sight, inspired by a friend with low vi-
sion. Many of the people Gerald drives
are from rural parts of our State or
don’t have the support networks they
need while undergoing treatment and
are profoundly grateful for the simple
act.
In addition to providing rides, Gerald
is also active in supporting adult Gran-
ite Staters who experience disabilities.
Inspired in part by raising his own
daughter who experiences Down syn-
drome, every Monday, Gerald plays
basketball with adults who experience
disabilities through Friends in Action
NH, an organization dedicated to pro-
viding social and recreational activi-
ties to those who experience disabil-
ities. Gerald also serves on the board of
the organization.
For his selfless work to support those
who need care in his community and to
ensure that those who experience dis-
abilities are fully included, I am proud
to recognize Gerald as the March 2019
Granite Stater of the Month.∑

For his entire life, Frank has been a
committed and fearless advocate for
working people. Now, after four dec-
ades of service, he is entering a well-
deserved retirement.
Frank began his career with
AFSCME in 1967, when he joined Local
1358 as a worker in the Brookline
Water Department. He quickly rose
through the union ranks, and in 1971,
he was elected president of the local.
Frank scored two huge victories for his
members early in his career. In 1973, he
successfully took his local on strike

and received important longevity bene-
fits for its members. He then fought for
survivor health insurance benefits for
all Brookline’s municipal employees,
taking the fight to the voters and win-
ning on a ballot initiative.
Frank would build on these achieve-
ments as his career progressed, improv-
ing the lives of thousands of public em-
ployees throughout New England. He
secured numerous wage increases, ob-
tained more paid sick leave time, and
successfully negotiated the Agency Fee
in Maine. In 2012, Frank was appointed
as the executive director of Council 93
and as vice president to the AFSCME
International Executive Board, where
he has served since. It is a leadership
position befiting his service and dedi-
cation.
On April 1, 2019, Frank will retire as
AFSCME Council 93 executive director.
Throughout my and Frank’s years of
service, I have had the privilege of
working closely with him and am
lucky enough to call him my friend.
Frank is irreplaceable, but his suc-
cesses have left the council strong and
one of the most effective AFSCME af-

TRIBUTE TO BRANDY BUNKLEY
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I
recognize Brandy Bunkley, the Union
County Teacher of the Year from
Union County High School in Lake
Butler, FL.
Brandy has taught for 21 years and is
the career specialist at Union County
High School. Her dedication and sup-
port for students has been credited for
the increasing graduation rate at the
school.
Brandy believes that every voice has
value and that every student matters.
As a teacher, she works to ensure her
students are developing clear and posi-
tive career paths for themselves and
provides a caring and enthusiastic sup-
port system.
Throughout her time at Union Coun-
ty High School, she has put a high im-
portance on the value of students’
voices and as individuals by forming
strong teaching relationships with her
students. She has continuously proven
that being an educator is deeply rooted
in her core.
I extend my sincere thanks and grati-
tude to Brandy for her dedication to
her students and look forward to hear-
ing of her continued success in the
years to come.∑
f
TRIBUTE TO KAMILLE CHAPMAN
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I
am pleased to honor Kamille Chapman,
the Lake County Teacher of the Year
from Mount Dora Middle School in
Mount Dora, FL.
After receiving this award, Kamille
credited the relationships she builds
with her students as one of the reasons
for her success. She works with her
students to improve their lives and
considers improved academic results a
byproduct. When some students have
behavioral issues, she invites them to
have lunch with her instead of writing
a referral, believing this to be an in-
vestment in their well-being.
Kamille’s eighth grade geometry stu-
dents score 21 percent higher than any
other school in her district and they
outperform their ninth and 10th grade
peers. Ninety-three percent of her alge-
bra students pass their end of course
exam, an increase from the previous 50
percent passage rate 2 years ago. She
originally returned to Mount Dora
Middle School with the intention to re-
tire in 2016 after first leaving in 1996.
Instead, her students inspired her to
continue teaching after being sur-
rounded by positive influences that re-
minded her why she became a teacher.
Kamille earned her bachelor’s degree
in health education from the State
University of New York Cortland and
her master’s degree in education from
Florida State University. She has
taught over a 32-year span in Houston,
TX, and several schools throughout
Lake County. She also worked as a cur-
riculum specialist for math and science
for middle and high schools in the
county.
I express my sincere thanks and ap-
preciation to Kamille for all the fine
work she has done throughout her ca-
reer for her students and offer my best
wishes on her future endeavors.∑

TRIBUTE TO JUSTEN EARLY
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I
honor Justen Early, the Hernando
County Teacher of the Year from Na-
ture Coast Technical High School in
Brooksville, FL.
Justen’s desire to become a teacher
began when he first volunteered as a
football coach at Central High School.
He became invested in the success of
his players, both on the football field
and in the classroom. From this experi-
ence, he decided his next step would be
to enter the classroom.
As a teacher, Justen seeks to build a
camaraderie to make students feel
they are a part of a community. He fo-
cuses on his students learning dif-
ferences and encourages them to make
teaching suggestions.
Justen attended Florida A&M Uni-
versity and currently teaches tech-
nology support classes. He serves as
the co-offensive coordinator of the high
school’s football team. He has been
with the school since 2014 and is grate-
ful for his school’s administration for
providing him the opportunity to
teach. Justen credits his success to his
mother, grandmother, aunt, Mrs. Rose-
marie Poluchowicz of the language arts
department, and Coach Rudolph Story
for their mentorship.
I extend my sincere thanks and grati-
tude to Justen for his dedication in
helping his students succeed in life and
offer my best wishes for his continued
success in the coming years.∑
TRIBUTE TO DONELLE EVENSEN
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I
recognize Donelle Evensen, the Flagler
County Teacher of the Year from
Rymfire Elementary School in Palm
Coast, Fl.
After receiving this award, Donelle
said, ‘‘It makes me feel like I may have
accomplished what I’ve set out to do
and that’s increase student achieve-
ment and increase support for our
teachers and make them feel like they’
re valued and are appreciated for what
they do every day.’’ She tries each day
to plan different ways to inspire and
excite students and teachers at her
school.
Donelle previously spent 10 weeks
backpacking through nine European
countries with her husband. This expe-
rience served as a reminder of life back
home and how we treat those around us
and the true value of all lives. She has
brought this reflection to her class-
room to share with her students.
Donelle has been an educator for 13
years and currently is the literacy
coach for kindergarten through sixth

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. THUNE (for himself and
Mr. WYDEN):
S. 765. A bill to promote neutrality,
simplicity, and fairness in the taxation
of digital goods and digital services; to
the Committee on Finance.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 765
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Digital
Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of
2019’’.
SEC. 2. MULTIPLE AND DISCRIMINATORY TAXES
PROHIBITED.
(a) MULTIPLE TAXES.—No State or local ju-
risdiction shall impose multiple taxes on the
sale or use of a covered electronic good or
service.
(b) DISCRIMINATORY TAXES.—No State or
local jurisdiction shall impose discrimina-
tory taxes on the sale or use of a digital good
or a digital service.
SEC. 3. SOURCING LIMITATION.
Subject to section 6(a), taxes on the sale of
a covered electronic good or service may
only be imposed by a State or local jurisdic-
tion whose territorial limits encompass the
customer tax address.
SEC. 4. CUSTOMER TAX ADDRESS.
(a) SELLER OBLIGATION.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subsection
(e)(2), a seller shall be responsible for obtain-
ing and maintaining in the ordinary course
of business the customer tax address with re-
spect to the sale of a covered electronic good
or service, and shall be responsible for col-
lecting and remitting the correct amount of
tax for the State and local jurisdictions
whose territorial limits encompass the cus-
tomer tax address if the State or local juris-
diction has the authority to require such col-
lection and remittance by the seller.
(2) CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS.—When a cus-
tomer tax address is not a business location
of the seller under clause (i) of section
7(4)(A)—
(A) if the sale is a separate and discrete
transaction, then a seller shall use reason-
able efforts to obtain a customer tax address,
as such efforts are described in clauses (iii),
(iv), and (v) of section 7(4)(A), before resort-
ing to using a customer tax address as deter-
mined by clause (vi) of such section 7(4)(A);
and
(B) if the sale is not a separate and discrete
transaction, then a seller shall use reason-
able efforts to obtain a customer tax address,
as such efforts are described in clauses (ii),
(iii), (iv), and (v) of section 7(4)(A), before re-
sorting to using a customer tax address as
determined by clause (vi) of such section
7(4)(A).
(b) RELIANCE ON CUSTOMER-PROVIDED IN-
FORMATION.—A seller that relies in good
faith on information provided by a customer
to determine a customer tax address shall
not be held liable for any additional tax
based on a different determination of that
customer tax address by a State or local ju-
risdiction or court of competent jurisdiction,
unless and until binding notice is given as
provided in subsection (c).
(c) ADDRESS CORRECTION.—If a State or
local jurisdiction is authorized under State
law to administer a tax, and the jurisdiction
determines that the customer tax address de-
termined by a seller is not the customer tax
address that would have been determined
under section 7(4)(A) if the seller had the ad-
ditional information provided by the State
or local jurisdiction, then the jurisdiction
may give binding notice to the seller to cor-
rect the customer tax address on a prospec-
tive basis, effective not less than 45 days
after the date of such notice, if—
(1) when the determination is made by a
local jurisdiction, such local jurisdiction ob-
tains the consent of all affected local juris-
dictions within the State before giving such
notice of determination; and
(2) before the State or local jurisdiction
gives such notice of determination, the cus-
tomer is given an opportunity to dem-
onstrate in accordance with applicable State
or local tax administrative procedures that
the address used is the customer tax address.
(d) COORDINATION WITH SOURCING OF MO-
BILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—If—
(A) a covered electronic good or service is
sold to a customer by a home service pro-

transaction for purposes of this Act.

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself
and Ms. HARRIS):
S. 774. A bill to adjust the boundary
of the Santa Monica Mountains Na-
tional Recreation Area to include the
Rim of the Valley Corridor, and for
other purposes; to the Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
am pleased to introduce the ‘‘Rim of
the Valley Corridor Preservation Act.’’
This legislation would expand the
boundaries of the Santa Monica Moun-
tains National Recreation Area by
191,000 acres.
This legislation would provide sur-
rounding communities with much-
needed access to nature and open
space, while maintaining private prop-
erty rights and existing local land-use
authorities.
The proposed expansion is based upon
findings of the National Park Service
after a six-year special resource study
of the area.
This study was directed by Congress
in the Rim of the Valley Corridor
Study Act, passed in 2008.
The National Park Service’s rec-
ommendation takes into account over
2,000 comments received from the pub-
lic, elected officials, local organiza-
tions, and other stakeholders.
This bill would add an additional
191,000 acres, known as the Rim of the
Valley Unit, to the existing Santa
Monica Mountains National Recreation
area to provide members of the local
community with improved recreational
and educational opportunities.
The proposed expansion would also
better protect natural resources and
habitats, including valuable habitat for
endangered wildlife, such as the Cali-
fornia red-legged frog, mountain lions,
bobcats, foxes, badgers, coyotes, and
deer.
Notably, the ‘‘Rim of the Valley Cor-
ridor Preservation Act’’ would only
allow the Department of the Interior to
acquire non-Federal land within the
new boundaries through exchange, do-
nation, or purchase from willing sell-
ers.
I want to highlight that this legisla-
tion will not create any additional li-
ability or restrictions for private prop-
erty owners.
This legislation will significantly ex-
pand outdoor recreational opportuni-
ties for residents of Los Angeles Coun-
ty, one of the most densely populated
and park-poor areas in California.
In fact, 47% of Californians—that’s
six percent of the total U.S. popu-
lation—live within two hours of the
proposed expansion area. Enlarging the
Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area, at no cost to U.S.
taxpayers, will provide these commu-
nities with increased access to public
lands and boost the local economy.
This bill enjoys the support of more
than 50 local municipalities, commu-
nity groups, and elected officials. It is
the product of significant public en-
gagement in the legislative process.
I would like to thank my colleague,
Representative ADAM SCHIFF, for re-in-
troducing this legislation in the House.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues to pass the ‘‘Rim of the Val-
ley Corridor Preservation Act’’ as
quickly as possible.
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the
floor.

agreed to:
S. RES. 108
Whereas the passing of Walter Beamon
Jones, Jr. (in this preamble referred to as

a monumental loss to his wife, JoeAnne, and
their daughter, Ashley, as well as a deep loss

Whereas Walter B. Jones was born on Feb-
ruary 10, 1943, in Farmville, North Carolina,
to Walter B. Jones, Sr., and Doris Long;

Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham,
Virginia, and went on to Atlantic Christian
College, where he received his degree in his-
tory in 1966;
Whereas, also in 1966, Walter B. Jones mar-
ried his wife of more than 50 years, JoeAnne
Whitehurst, and they later welcomed their
only child, Ashley Elizabeth;
Whereas Walter B. Jones went on to serve
for 4 years in the North Carolina National
Guard, beginning his long career of serving
the people of North Carolina;

elected to represent the Third Congressional
District of North Carolina in the House of
Representatives of the United States, where
he served for 12 full terms;
Whereas, although Walter B. Jones began
his political career as a Democrat and later
switched to the Republican Party, he always
voted with his constituents of Eastern North
Carolina in mind, regardless of party posi-
tion;
Whereas Walter B. Jones worked tirelessly
on the Committee on Armed Services of the
House of Representatives to advocate for
members of the Armed Forces and their fam-
ilies;
Whereas Walter B. Jones was a staunch ad-
vocate for peace and began a letter-writing
campaign to the loved ones of the fallen sol-
diers in Iraq and Afghanistan, personally
sending more than 11,200 letters;
Whereas Walter B. Jones worked for 14
years to finally restore honor to and clear
the names of 2 deceased Marine pilots who
had been wrongly blamed for a military acci-
dent that took the lives of 17 other Marines;
Whereas the heritage of Eastern North
Carolina held an important place in the
heart of Walter B. Jones, moving him to pro-
tect the Shackleford Banks Wild Horses and
to work to extend protections to the Corolla
Wild Horses that have freely roamed the
beaches of North Carolina for centuries;
Whereas Walter B. Jones worked closely
with Government agencies in his district,
particularly the National Park Service, to
ensure his constituents and guests in the dis-
trict were able to enjoy the natural beauty
of the coastline of North Carolina;
Whereas Walter B. Jones had an out-
standing working relationship with the fish-
ermen and beach communities in the Third
Congressional District of North Carolina, al-
ways advocating on behalf of the marine in-
dustry and maintaining continuous engage-
ment on coastal issues;
Whereas, in 2004, Walter B. Jones was voted
by congressional staffers as the nicest Mem-
ber of Congress, a testament to his ever-gra-
cious and humble demeanor;
Whereas Walter B. Jones, always a man of
the people, built an outstanding record in
constituent services, ensuring every person
in his district would have access to him and
his office; and
Whereas Walter B. Jones is survived by his
wife of 53 years, JoeAnne, and daughter, Ash-
ley Elizabeth: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) honors the life, accomplishments, and
legacy of Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr.;
and
(2) extends its warmest sympathies to the
family, friends, and loved ones of Congress-

SEC. 6. REQUIREMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL
ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY ADDI-
TIONAL PROTOCOL AS CONDITION
OF ENTERING INTO CIVILIAN NU-
CLEAR COOPERATION AGREEMENT
WITH THE UNITED STATES PURSU-
ANT TO SECTION 123 OF THE ATOM-
IC ENERGY ACT OF 1954.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) In 1971, the International Atomic En-
ergy Agency (IAEA) established the Com-
prehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA),
which non-nuclear weapons states party to
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nu-
clear Weapons, signed at Washington July 1,
1968 (commonly known as the ‘‘NPT’’), are
obligated to bring into force to verify com-
pliance with their nonproliferation obliga-
tions under the treaty.
(2) In 1997, the International Atomic En-
ergy Agency (IAEA) established the model
Additional Protocol to CSAs, which grants
the IAEA expanded rights of access to infor-
mation and sites related to a state’s peaceful
nuclear program.
(3) The IAEA and international non-
proliferation community established the Ad-
ditional Protocol as a response to major
shocks to the nonproliferation regime, most
notably revelations that the IAEA’s existing
safeguards system had failed to detect the
Government of Iraq’s covert, undeclared nu-
clear program for non-peaceful purposes
prior to the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
(4) The Additional Protocol strengthens
the IAEA’s ability not only to verify the
non-diversion of declared nuclear material
but also to provide assurances as to the ab-
sence of undeclared nuclear material activi-
ties in a state by—
(A) applying IAEA safeguards to a state’s
entire nuclear program, including uranium
mining and milling sites, fuel fabrication,
enrichment, and nuclear waste sites, as well
as to any other location where nuclear is or
may be present;
(B) expanding the amount and type of in-
formation a state is obligated to report to
the IAEA regarding its nuclear program and
related activities;
(C) expanding the IAEA’s inspection access
at declared—and undeclared—locations to
verify the absence of undeclared material or
to resolve questions or inconsistencies in the
information a state has provided about its
nuclear activities; and
(D) specifying the IAEA’s right to use addi-
tional safeguards methods and equipment,
including environmental sampling at both
declared and undeclared sites.
(5) Universalizing the Additional Protocol
and establishing it as the international
standard for IAEA safeguards has been a bi-
partisan objective of United States non-
proliferation policy since the Additional
Protocol’s adoption.
(6) During the 2000 NPT Review Conference
at the United Nations, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright endorsed the ‘‘IAEA’s
new strengthened safeguards to deter and de-
tect cheating’’ and urged ‘‘all states to adopt
them’’.
(7) During the 2005 NPT Review Conference
at the United Nations, Assistant Secretary
of State for Arms Control Stephen G.
Rademaker stated that President George W.
Bush’s nonproliferation policy included
‘‘universalizing adherence to the Additional
Protocol and making it a condition of nu-
clear supply’’.
(8) During the 2015 NPT Review Con-
ference, Secretary of State John Kerry em-
phasized that the ‘‘United States is working
to bring the Additional Protocol into force
globally and to make it the global standard
for safeguards compliance’’.
(9) During the 2018 IAEA General Con-
ference, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry de-
livered a letter on behalf of President Donald
J. Trump, announcing that the United States
‘‘will continue promoting high standards of
safety, security, safeguards, and non-
proliferation, including an Additional Pro-
tocol as the international standard, and call
on other nations to do the same’’.
(10) At the same conference, Assistant Sec-
retary of State for International Security
and Nonproliferation Christopher Ashley
Ford stressed that the Additional Protocol
‘‘should be universalized, and all supplier
states should make adherence to the AP by
recipient states a condition for nuclear sup-
ply’’.
(11) As of December 2018, 134 states have
brought in force the Additional Protocol
with the IAEA while another 16 states have
signed the Additional Protocol but have yet
to bring it into force.
(12) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has not
brought into force an Additional Protocol. It
currently has a Small Quantities Protocol
(SQP) with the IAEA, a safeguards agree-
ment that suspends the application of many
provisions of a CSA for countries with mini-
mal nuclear material and activities on its
territory or under its jurisdiction.
(13) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has ex-
pressed its intent to build an extensive civil-
ian nuclear program, including two large-
scale nuclear power reactors and multiple
small modular reactors.
(14) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will no
longer be eligible for a SQP and will be obli-
gated to implement a CSA with the IAEA
without exemptions if it either has nuclear
material in quantities exceeding minimal
limits or constructs nuclear facilities on its
territory or under its jurisdiction, including
a nuclear reactor.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the Additional Protocol represents the
international safeguards standard;
(2) Saudi Arabia should, at a minimum,
bring into force an Additional Protocol with
the IAEA as a requirement under any nu-
clear cooperation agreement with the United
States made pursuant to section 123 of the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2153);
and
(3) any future civilian nuclear cooperation
agreement with other nations pursuant to
section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954
(42 U.S.C. 2153) should require that the pro-
posed recipient has in force an Additional
Protocol to its safeguards agreement with
the IAEA.
(c) REQUIREMENTS FOR CIVIL NUCLEAR CO-
OPERATION AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER NA-
TIONS.—Section 123a. of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2153(a)) is amended—
(1) in paragraph (8), by striking ‘‘; and’’ and
inserting a semicolon;
(2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period
at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and
(3) by inserting after paragraph (9) the fol-
lowing new paragraph:
‘‘(10) the cooperating party has in force an
Additional Protocol to its safeguards agree-
ment with the IAEA.’’.

RECOGNIZING STEPHAN KAMINSKY
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life Mr. Stephan
Kaminsky, an esteemed veteran, Veterans of
Foreign Wars (VFW) Post Commander and
community volunteer who passed away in
January at the age of 73.
Mr. Kaminsky served four years in the Navy
during the Vietnam War, where he was sta-
tioned on the USS Epperson DD719, a de-
stroyer.
After his service, Mr. Kaminsky remained
active with community veteran organizations
as a member of the Mundelein American Le-
gion No. 867 and Commander of the
Libertyville VFW Post 8741. He also served as
President of the USS Epperson DD–719 Asso-
ciation, participating in reunions of former
shipmates around the United States every two
years.
Within VFW, Mr. Kaminsky was particularly
active in the Buddy Poppy Donation Drive.
The poppy is the official flower of the VFW,
and represents the blood shed by American
service members. Mr. Kaminsky’s work to en-
sure the drive’s success benefitted local vet-
erans’ welfare in the Lake County area. He
was also a vital leader in the VFW ‘‘Patriots’
Pen’’ essay contest. He was also a member of
the Color Guard and Honor Guard and could
frequently be seen marching in community pa-
rades for events ranging from the high school
homecoming dance to the Fourth of July.
A graduate of the University of Illinois Chi-
cago, Mr. Kaminsky was Vice President of the
First American Bank of Elk Grove Village. He
was also an avid sports fan who enjoyed play-
ing volleyball and rooting for Notre Dame and
the White Sox.
I extend my sincere sympathies to his wife,
Elizabeth, and the many family and friends
who mourn his passing. It is my great honor
to recognize Mr. Stephan Kaminsky today and
celebrate his service to our nation and to the
veterans in our community.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Martin F. Quinn who will
receive the Achievement Award from the
Greater Pittston Friendly Sons of St. Patrick at
their annual St. Patrick’s Day dinner on Sun-
day, March 17, 2019. Martin is an active mem-
ber of the Greater Pittston Friendly Sons, and
he was named Man of the Year by the organi-
zation in 2010.
Martin Quinn is the son of the late Martin J.
Quinn and Margaret Mitchell Quinn. He was
born and raised in the Cork Lane section of
Pittston Township and graduated from Pittston
Central Catholic High School in 1955. Moti-
vated by the desire to serve his country, Mar-
tin served in the United States Army. Fol-
lowing an honorable discharge from the Army,
Martin transitioned to civilian life. Martin is a li-
censed electrician and served as the recording
secretary for the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, Local No. 1153. Prior to re-
turning to Northeastern Pennsylvania in 1973,
he worked in the trucking industry in New Jer-
sey and was vice president of the Teamsters
Union Local No. 701. He was employed by the
Lehigh Valley Railroad and ConRail, Inc. for
over thirty years, retiring as a Line Foreman in
1999.
Martin is an ardent supporter of education,
having served on the Pittston Area School
Board for 28 years. During his time on the
board, he was instrumental in the construction
of the Pittston Area Primary Center in
Hughestown. In recognition of his efforts, the
school was named in his honor in November
2016.
Martin is a steadfast community servant and
dedicates his time to many local clubs, civic
organizations, and community activities. He is
a charter member of the Wolfe Tone Luzerne
County Division 1 Ancient Order of Hibernians.
He is also a member of the Knights of Colum-
bus John F. Kennedy Council No. 372 and its

Lady of the Eucharist Parish.
Martin lives in Pittston with his wife Barbara.
They are proud parents and proud in-law par-
ents of Mitch and his wife Kim, Mike and his
wife Tara, and Brian and his wife Denise. And
they are equally proud grandparents of Zach,
Jake, Samantha, Katie, and Kearney.
It is an honor to recognize Martin F. Quinn
for a lifetime of community involvement and
service. I am grateful for the work he has
done on behalf of the people of the Greater
Pittston Area and wish him all the best on this
St. Patrick’s Day.

INTRODUCTION OF DIGITAL GOODS
AND SERVICES TAX FAIRNESS
ACT
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the Digital Goods and Services Tax
Fairness Act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill I in-
troduced earlier today along with my colleague
on the Judiciary Committee, Representative
JOHN RATCLIFFE from Texas, and in the Sen-
ate, Senators JOHN THUNE from South Dakota
and RON WYDEN from Oregon, to curb dis-
criminatory taxation of digital goods and serv-
ices.
We live in an increasingly digitized world.
Digital goods and services make consumption
of entertainment media more convenient and
have a lighter carbon footprint than their tan-
gible analogs such as e-books, movies, online
documents and much more. In addition, many
vital health, education, and computer systems
have turned to digital goods and services to
increase the reliability and efficiency of access
to important data.
The lack of a uniform framework for state
taxation of digital goods and services has led
to a patchwork of state tax laws that confuses
consumers and unnecessarily challenges the
digital economy. Consumers risk being taxed
by multiple jurisdictions for a single download.
For instance, three different states can cur-
rently tax the same purchase of a digital good
or service.
Discriminatory taxes also discourage the
new, innovative, emerging technologies and
products that American inventors continue to
develop.
The Digital Goods and Services Tax Fair-
ness Act would ensure that consumers are not
taxed at a higher rate for purchasing digital
goods than they are for purchasing tangible
goods by establishing a national framework to
determine which state has the right to decide
whether to tax a digital transaction. It would
also protect consumers from potential multiple
state taxes on a single digital purchase.
This is common sense legislation that is
necessary in our booming digital economy. I
urge both the House and the Senate to swiftly
pass this bill.

RECOGNIZING JIM ROBBINS
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Mr. Jim Robbins, a veteran
of the Marine Corps who honorably served our
country and his community, and who passed
away in January at the age of 90.
Upon graduating from Libertyville High
School in 1946, Mr. Robbins immediately en-
listed in the U.S. Marine Corps, serving in
China and Guam in the years following World
War II. During his service, Mr. Robbins was
stationed in Tangku, China and was one of
the Marines who defended the Hsin Ho Am-
munition Supply Depot against attack in April
1947.
After returning to the U.S. in 1950, he
served as Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW)
Post 8741’s commander for several years and
as the Post’s quartermaster for 32 years. He
was especially known for his work with young
people and recent veterans.
In addition, Mr. Robbins was the primary
leader in making the veterans’ monument in
Lakeside Cemetery in Libertyville a reality.
Every Memorial Day, Jim read off the names
of former Libertyville township residents who
had died in service to our nation at a commu-
nity observance ceremony. He viewed this as
a great honor and carefully wrote down their
names phonetically in a personal notebook to
ensure he properly pronounced the name of
each fallen hero.
In his professional life, Mr. Robbins was a
contract glazing salesman for 30 years. He
also worked with the Lake County Forest Pre-
serve for many years at the Fox River Pre-
serve. He leaves behind two children, five be-
loved grandchildren, and several nieces and
nephews.
It is my great honor and privilege to recog-
nize the life of Jim Robbins and thank him for
his service to our country and tireless work on
behalf of other veterans in our community.
RECOGNIZING RONALD E. POWELL
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to honor Ronald E. Powell for a
lifetime of vigorous and effective advocacy
protecting the rights of workers in my home
state of Illinois, and for working men and
women across the United States.
Ron’s service in the labor movement began
in 1961, when he was hired as a Field Rep-
resentative for the United Retail Workers
Union (URW). Thanks to his effectiveness as
an organizer, he rose quickly through the
ranks, becoming a Supervisor of Field Staff in
1968, and the Vice President and Director of
Field Operations in 1973.
In 1981, the URW, with a membership total-
ing 6,000 workers, affiliated with the United
Food and Commercial Workers Union and
formed Local 881 of the UFCW. (The name
‘‘Local 881’’ was chosen to commemorate the
date of its affiliation—August of 1981.)
Ron was elected president of Local 881 in
1983. Under his leadership, Local 881 has
grown to represent 34,000 workers and is one
of the largest affiliates in the UFCW family of
unions that represent over 1.3 million workers
across the world. While managing that growth,
Ron found time to shoulder other responsibil-
ities, including serving as Vice President on
the International Executive Board of UFCW,
Vice President of the state of Illinois AFL–CIO,
Chairman of the Illinois State Investment
Board, and as a member of the Illinois Work-
ers’ Compensation Medical Fee Advisory
Board, the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition
Authority Board, and the board of Blue Cross
Blue Shield of Illinois.
Ron’s distinguished resumé does not tell the
full story of his service to our community. He
has worked tirelessly to advocate for the men
and women who provide essential but often in-
visible services in a world increasingly indif-
ferent to their rights and needs. Countless
families are grateful to Ron and the efforts of
Local 881 for improved wages and safety con-
ditions in industries that include food service
and preparation, meat packing, groceries,
chemical manufacturing and retail. I know Ron
takes great pride in the part he played in the
recent enactment of the City of Chicago Paid
Sick Leave Ordinance, extending paid leave
protection for the first time to thousands of
workers (and UFCW members) who live in our
community.
Both personally and in furtherance of his
work for the UFCW, Ron has been civically
engaged, serving as a Trustee on the Village
Board of Mundelein, and as a delegate to the
Democratic National Convention. Over the
years Ron has supported countless can-
didates that were committed to protecting the
rights of working men and women, including a
young United States Senator named Barack
Obama who ultimately served two terms as
President of the United States.
Many charities owe thanks to Ron as well.
Under his stewardship, the Local 881 Chari-
table Foundation has been a strong supporter
of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Ron
also organized fundraising efforts for Jackson
Park Hospital in Chicago and the Little City
Foundation, which serves developmentally dis-
abled children and adults in the Chicagoland
area.
Ron is blessed with four ochildren—one of
whom, Steven, currently serves as President
of Local 881 and an International Vice Presi-
dent of the UFCW—and many children, grand-
children and great-grandchildren. He is held in
esteem by numerous organizers and union of-
ficials he has mentored over the course of his
career, and the thousands of workers whose
lives have been made better through his ef-
forts.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the 34,000
members of Local 881 of the UFCW, and the
millions of hard-working men and women of
the state of Illinois who owe so much to Ron
Powell, I offer my thanks for nearly 60 years
of dedicated and selfless service to our com-
munity. Although Ron may have retired from
his positions with the UFCW, I know he has
not retired from his commitment to service,
and on behalf of all Illinoisans and Americans
I wish him great success in his next chapter.

TWENTY YEARS OF REP-
RESENTING SOUTH DAKOTA AT
THE NATIONAL LEVEL
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON
OF SOUTH DAKOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam
Speaker, it will be the 20th time Spearfish
High School will represent South Dakota at
the national ‘‘We the People: The Citizen and
the Constitution’’ competition this spring.
The team won the state competition Thurs-
day at Black Hills State University.
‘‘It’s commendable that you guys do
this . . . . I think this will be a memorable ex-
perience for you,’’ Wes Brown, of the Vantage
Institute, a nonprofit organization that provides
education, training, and support for issues fac-
ing communities, said. He thanked the stu-
dents for their hard work, the judges for their
time, and everyone involved for making the
event possible.
The We the People program promotes civic
competence and responsibility for upper ele-
mentary and secondary students. The pro-
gram was created in 1987, directed by the
Center for Civic Education and funded by the
U.S. Department of Education under the Edu-
cation for Democracy Act.
During the competition, student units take
on simulated congressional hearing questions,
demonstrating their knowledge and under-
standing of the Constitution and Bill of Rights
and current constitutional issues. Each unit
prepares a four-minute statement to present to
the panel of judges acting as a congressional
committee, and they then answer follow-up
questions posed by the committee members.
The units are scored on understanding, Con-
stitutional application, reasoning, supporting
evidence, responsiveness, and participation.
The Spearfish team is made up of seniors
Lily Dennison, Gene Glover, Paxton Klug,
Rigel Roberdeau, Kenna Comer, Kennedy
Kaitfors, Rylee Niesent, Taylor Hersch, Justin
Steedley, Hannah Tysdal, Ana Buchholz,
Peter Marich, Morgan Roberts, Zach Tipton,
Sophia Caldwell, Nathan Davis, Thomas
Friedrich, Ella Neiman, Tim Doerges, Izzy
Drumm, Jay Sayler, and Chelsea Williams.

erts, and Tipton, were named the best unit for
the Spearfish team, and Friedrich was named
the Larson Best Speaker Award for the team.
Lead-Deadwood High School, taught by
Matthew Campbell, also competed. The team
is made up of students Chayton Bower, Carter
Nelson, Eric Schumacher, Kyler Farmer-

Morrison.
Unit 6a, made up of Bourgo, Pfeiffer-Munoz,
and Wilks, was named best unit, and Pfeiffer-
Munoz was named the Larson Best Speaker
Award for the team.
Brown encouraged everyone to spread the
word about the program. He said in the last
decade, the most teams that participated in
South Dakota were seven, versus the two
teams competing this year. He added that Wy-
oming has 18 teams competing to represent
the state.
‘‘Thanks so much for putting in the effort,’’
Brown said.
Spearfish High School will join approxi-
mately 1,200 students from 56 high school
classes from across the nation to compete in
the We the People National Finals April 26–29
at the National Conference Center in Wash-
ington, D.C.
‘‘I’m really proud of how hard the kids
worked,’’ Gainey said of the students. ‘‘They
put in—it’s not just class time—they meet out-
side of school, they meet at each other’s
houses, they go and interview professionals,
they talk to lawyers and public officials, to get
information for their presentations. It’s a class,
I think, that inspires a lot of devotion and com-
mitment to each other. I like it because it’s a
little bit like football or basketball in that you
could have the smartest kid in the state and
you still might not win because it’s a team ef-
fort.’’

RECOGNIZING FEMALE LEADERS
OF COLLIN COUNTY
HON. VAN TAYLOR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, celebrated
each March, ‘‘Women’s History Month’’ serves
as a time to honor and recognize the momen-
tous achievements of women who have and
continue to shape the United States today.
What began as a week-long celebration in
1981, has evolved into a month reserved to
celebrate female leaders across the nation.
Established annually by Presidential Procla-
mations since 1995, each March, we hear sto-
ries of incredible women who have broken
barriers, set records, and inspired us all from
coast to coast.
This year, I am especially proud to highlight
a group of women making history right in
Texas’ Third Congressional District.
Collin County, Texas contains eleven Dis-
trict Courts, with eleven presiding judges, and
seven County Courts at Law, with seven pre-
siding judges.
In 2017, the addition of new judges brought
the total number of female judges serving on
the District Courts to six, meaning, for the first
time in history, the majority of the court seats
were held by women. But, just this year, with
the election of another judge in Texas’ 219th
District Court, there are now seven women
serving on the county’s district benches.
Making the accomplishment even more re-
markable, just twelve years ago, there was
only one female judge on the county’s bench-
es.
While only 33 percent of judges throughout
the United States are women, Collin County is
leading the way for women in law and justice
careers with 64 percent of the district benches
served by female judges.
To our great female judges, Judge Corrine
Mason, Judge Angela Tucker, Judge Jennifer
Edgeworth, Judge Andrea Thompson, Judge
Cynthia Wheless, Judge Jill Willis, Judge
Piper McCraw, and Judge Emily Miskel, I
thank them for their service to our county, to
Texas, and as an inspiration to so many.
Madam Speaker, today, and every day, let
us honor those women setting course for the
next generation of American leaders.

IN RECOGNITION OF GLOBAL
RECYCLING DAY
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
draw my colleagues’ attention to Global Recy-
cling Day on March 18. Global Recycling Day
was created in 2018 to help recognize, and
celebrate, the importance recycling plays in
preserving our primary resources and securing
the future of our planet.
The creation of Global Recycling Day is
aimed at the promotion of a global and united
approach to recycling. The mission of Global
Recycling Day is to help world leaders under-
stand that recycling is too important not to be
a global issue, and to ask all citizens of the
world to think of recyclables in terms of what
they are: valuable resources, not waste. By
combining as many voices and efforts as pos-
sible on a single day, together we are raising
awareness of the urgent need to be more reli-
able recyclers and more conscientious con-
sumers.
There are six major natural resources on
the planet, Madam Speaker—water, air, coal,
oil, natural gas and minerals. I think
recyclables ought to be thought of as the
world’s Seventh Resource.
Recycling prevents more CO2 emissions
each year than those generated by the entire
aviation industry, while simultaneously reduc-
ing the need to extract the Earth’s finite virgin
natural resources. Without recycling, all our
used refrigerators, plastic bottles, packing
boxes, cars, cell phones and paper cups
would contribute to the growing waste moun-
tains, which are either incinerated or sent to
landfill—never to be used again.
In the United States alone, we recycle more
than 130 million metric tons of scrap materials
every year and employ more than 130,000
American workers. These valuable materials
go directly back into the manufacturing chain,
helping manufacturers be more energy effi-
cient.
Global Recycling Day 2019 will work to get
more young people engaged with the power of
the Seventh Resource through a variety of key
partnerships. The initiative will also work with
businesses and entrepreneurs globally to
share their innovation, concepts and ideas for
better recycling practices in the future.
As the House Recycling Caucus Co-Chair, I
am committed to helping foster economically
viable and sustainable recycling in the United
States to protect our environment, save en-
ergy and conserve natural resources for my
kid’s and their kid’s futures.
Recycling is the easiest way all of us can
make a positive difference in our planet’s fu-
ture while supporting our economy through the
creation of tens of thousands of jobs.
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask that my
colleagues join me in celebrating Global Recy-
cling Day by getting involved and, of course,
by recycling.

HONORING LAURA SKAER
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of
Laura Skaer, Executive Director of the Amer-
ican Exploration & Mining Association. Laura
is retiring this month, after serving as Execu-
tive Director of the AEMA for the last 22
years.
Laura’s work on behalf of the AEMA has led
this organization to become the largest mem-
bership-based mining industry trade associa-
tion in the United States. Laura’s career began
as a lawyer in Missouri, but eventually took
her through various positions in the natural re-
sources industry. Laura has played a vital role
in advocating for our natural resources indus-
try, and is well known for her effective work in
coordinating the efforts of the public and pri-
vate sectors.
Laura has also been widely acknowledged
for her efforts on behalf of the AEMA. Among
her many awards and accolades, Laura has
been named President of the Independent Pe-
troleum Association Mountain States, Regional
Vice President of the Independent Petroleum
Association of America, and a member of
Colorado’s Minerals, Energy and Geology Pol-
icy Advisory Board. Additionally, in 2004,
Laura received the U.S. Bureau of Land Man-
agement’s Sustainable Development Award
and has also received special recognition from
the U.S. Forest Service, Division of Minerals &
Geology Management.
I appreciate Laura’s work on behalf of the
AEMA and the positive example she provides
to the people of Eastern Washington. I wish
her the best in this next chapter of her life.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ENSURING
FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE
CENSUS ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Ensuring Full Participation in the
Census Act of 2019, which would prohibit the
U.S. Census Bureau from including questions
on the decennial census about citizenship, na-
tionality or immigration status.
This bill is essential because the Depart-
ment of Justice has written to the Bureau that
it ‘‘reinstate on the 2020 Census questionnaire
a question regarding citizenship.’’ From 1970
to 2000, this question was sent to only ap-
proximately 16 percent of the population dur-
ing any decennial census through the so-
called ‘‘long-form.’’ However, the long-form
system was dropped from the census and re-
placed with the current American Community
Survey (ACS). The ACS is sent to approxi-
mately 3 million people annually on a rota-
tional basis, instead of just with the decennial
census, and allows the Bureau to get the nec-
essary information on citizenship, without ask-
ing every respondent during the decennial
census. Asking questions about citizenship
status to every American through the decen-
nial census has not been done in almost 70
years because it would discourage people,
largely in minority communities, which are al-
ready undercounted in the census, from par-
ticipating in the census. The ACS was created
to make the decennial census simpler for
American citizens to complete, thus encour-
aging a higher and more accurate participant
rate, and to preserve privacy. Adding a ques-
tion back into the decennial census about citi-
zenship would defeat this purpose of the ACS.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E299
March 13, 2019
ACS is more than sufficient to determine citi-
zenship statistics within the U.S. We must en-
sure that all individuals are counted in the de-
cennial census, thereby providing accurate al-
location of federal funds and representation in
Congress, not reduce participation by already
undercounted minorities because they fear an-
swering questions that are already addressed
elsewhere.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
bill.

HONORING KEVIN TURPIN FOR RE-
CEIVING THE TIDEWATER CHAP-
TER HUMANITARIAN AWARD
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and recognize Kevin Turpin on receiving
the 2019 Humanitarian Award for the Tide-
water Chapter of the Virginia Center for Inclu-
sive Communities. This is an amazing accom-
plishment.
This award recognizes Kevin’s lifetime of
service and commitment to the promotion of
respect among people of diverse back-
grounds. As Executive Director of the Life En-
richment Center, he serves the local commu-
nity by providing tutors for children struggling
in school or at home. He has gathered over
250 volunteers to serve the children, and the
ministry continues to expand. The positive im-
pact will be seen for many generations.
Kevin’s dedication to strengthening bonds
among people of different racial, ethnic, and
religious backgrounds is truly inspiring. I am
proud to honor and recognize his leadership
and the role he plays in making our commu-
nity a better place. The Tidewater Region has
significantly benefited from his presence.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE AMERICAN LE-
GION
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to recognize the 100th anniversary
of The American Legion, the nation’s largest
wartime veterans’ service organization.
Through the years, The American Legion
has evolved from a group of World War I vet-
erans into one of the most influential nonprofit
groups in the United States. Today, member-
ship stands at over two million in more than
13,000 posts worldwide. The posts are orga-
nized into 55 departments: one each for the
50 states, along with the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, France, Mexico, and the Phil-
ippines.
The Legion is a nonpartisan, not-for-profit
organization, with a strong grassroots involve-
ment in politics and the legislative process.
The Legion’s success depends entirely on ac-
tive membership, participation, and vol-
unteerism. The organization belongs to the
people it serves and the communities in which
it thrives.
The Legion stands behind the issues most
important to our nation’s veterans, backed by
resolutions passed by volunteer leadership.
Legionnaires’ sense of obligation to their com-
munity, state, and nation drives their advocacy
for veterans and their needs.
On March 15, 1919, members of the Amer-
ican Expeditionary Force convened in Paris for
the first American Legion caucus. Congress
chartered the group that September. That No-
vember, delegates to The American Legion’s
first National Convention established the Le-
gion’s values of service to community, state,
and nation. Those values would form the Le-
gion’s four pillars upon which this great organi-
zation of men and women still stands: Vet-
erans Affairs & Rehabilitation, National Secu-
rity, Americanism, and Children & Youth.
These pillars remain in place to support vet-
erans, national security, patriotism, and the
children and youth of America, the future of
our great nation. Based on these pillars, the
Legion has built programs with an unparalleled
impact on American society during its first
century of service.
The Legion has influenced considerable so-
cial change in America and won substantial
victories for veterans, advocating for the es-
tablishment of the Veterans Administration, the
Department of Veterans Affairs, and the G.I.
Bill. The G.I. Bill helped make higher edu-
cation, home ownership, and future employ-
ment possible for veterans; it also provided an
opportunity for veterans to dispute the charac-
terization of military discharge, which had
been at the discretion of the commanding offi-
cer without an explanation. Eventually, this
policy led to the founding of the Board of Vet-
erans Appeals.
For decades, the Legion also fought to
strengthen the nation through a non-manda-
tory ‘‘Universal Military Training’’ so our coun-
try would be prepared in the event of war. Out
of this belief came the Reserve Forces Act of
1955, which launched the modern Reserve
component of our military, as well as the Na-
tional Guard.
The Legion has also produced or supported
many important programs for children and
youth. Some of these are well-known to many
Americans, including American Legion Base-
ball, one of the nation’s most successful ama-
teur athletic programs; Boys I Girls State and
Girls I Boys Nation; the National Oratorical
Contest; The American Legion Veterans &
Children Foundation; the Boy Scouts; and
scholarships. Around the country, the Legion
has also sponsored the Junior ROTC, youth
law enforcement academies, and a Junior
Shooting Sports program.
Since 1989, victims of disasters have re-
ceived tens of millions of dollars from the Le-
gion’s National Emergency Fund. The Legion
has also funded research to help veterans
who have suffered from post-traumatic stress
disorder, Gulf War Illness, burn pits, and other
service-connected problems and diseases. In
the 1980s, the Legion partnered with Colum-
bia University to prove Agent Orange killed
thousands of Vietnam War veterans, made
many more sick, and caused birth defects
among their children. Eventually, the Legion
sued the federal government so that affected
veterans and their families could get the nec-
essary care they needed and were owed.
These are just some of the accomplish-
ments and programs The American Legion
provides for our veterans and youth. Our
country would not be as strong as we are
today without the Legion’s advocacy, services,
and compassion for its fellow Americans dur-
ing times of war and times of peace.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating and thanking The Amer-
ican Legion for its 100 years of exemplary
leadership, dedicated service, and outstanding
commitment to ensuring our country remains
strong for generations to come.

RECOGNIZING APRYLE CRISWELL
JACKSON
HON. DARREN SOTO
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of
Women’s History Month, I want to recognize
Apryle Criswell Jackson, an educator for the
School District of Osceola County, Florida.
Apryle graduated Cum Laude from California
University of Pennsylvania with a double
major. She was one of a very few women in
the 1970s to participate in the coaching certifi-
cation program there.
Apryle has taught for 39 years. She started
in the Elizabeth Forward School District in
Pennsylvania and has spent the last 36 years
in Osceola County. She has always taught ‘‘at
risk students’’ in grades kindergarten through
Adult Ed.
Apryle has always been an advocate for
children. She has donated her time to various
athletic programs in Osceola County. Apryle
was one of the first coaches when
Buenaventura Lakes started their Little League
program. She has served on the board of di-
rectors for numerous organizations throughout
Osceola County. She is a First-Class Girl
Scout and recognized the need for a program
in Osceola County. Apryle worked diligently to
start the Friendship Service Unit for Girl
Scouts. She is also an advocate for children
with disabilities in the county. She encouraged
the music director at Harmony High School to
start a music program for special needs stu-
dents this school year.
Apryle has been active in the Osceola
County Education Association for over 35
years. She has been president for the last
eight years fighting for better working condi-
tions of all educators in Osceola County.
Under her leadership, OCEA has held numer-
ous events for children. They recently distrib-
uted over l0,000 books to students. In 2017,
following the tragedy of Hurricane Maria,
Apryle worked with local agencies to host an
event where evacuee students, and their fami-
lies from Puerto Rico, could get the assistance
they needed and distributed books to all chil-
dren in Spanish and English. Under her lead-
ership OCEA has developed numerous pro-
grams to support children in our community.
Apryle’s dedication to serving those in our
community is an inspiration to all. Apryle
Criswell Jackson, for that we honor you.

PRYLE, 2019 PENNSYLVANIA
TEACHER OF THE YEAR
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Marilyn Pryle, who was named
the 2019 Pennsylvania Teacher of the Year by
the Pennsylvania Department of Education at
their annual professional development con-
ference on December 10, 2018. Marilyn was
selected as the Teacher of the Year from a
competitive field of twelve finalists for her
dedication to students, unparalleled commit-
ment to her field, and her innovative methods
of pedagogy.
After receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree
from the University of Scranton, Marilyn began
her teaching career with the Jesuit Volunteer
Corps in Kathmandu, Nepal. In 1996, she re-
ceived her Master’s degree in education, also
from the University of Scranton. While teach-
ing in Braintree, Massachusetts, Marilyn
earned her Master of Fine Arts in creative writ-
ing from Emerson College. She is a National
Board Certified teacher in secondary English
and reading instruction and has experience
teaching at the middle school, high school,
and college levels.
In addition to extolling the virtues of lit-
erature and the art of writing to high school
students, Marilyn has devoted much of her ca-
reer to educating educators. She is steadfastly
dedicated to the field of teaching and has
challenged educators to ‘‘create an inspired
classroom.’’ She is also an advocate for the
indispensable place the humanities have in
our education system. Marilyn is the author of
seven books about teaching reading and writ-
ing, and she speaks regularly at local, state,
and national conferences. As Teacher of the
Year, she will continue to speak, educate, and
inspire both pre-service teachers and experi-
enced teachers at events and meetings across
Pennsylvania.
In addition to her work in the classroom and
many speaking engagements, Marilyn is an
ardent community volunteer and advocate. To-
gether with Catholic Social Services, she facili-
tates an English-as-a-second-language con-
versation group for refugees in the Scranton
area.
It is an honor to recognize Marilyn Pryle as
the 2019 Pennsylvania Teacher of the Year.
Her level of dedication to her students, her
profession, and her community has been re-
markable. Marilyn has always possessed an
unwavering zeal for teaching and a belief that,
with the right tutelage, any student can suc-
ceed, and that has produced wonderful re-
sults. May she continue to energize and in-
spire students and teachers alike for many
years to come.

TEXAS
HON. KENNY MARCHANT
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Scott Rhodes on his
well-earned retirement from the City of Grape-
vine, Texas Police Department after twenty-
nine years of dedicated service as a law en-
forcement officer.
Scott is a hardworking and highly respected

more, he has earned meritorious service bars

His legacy will leave a lasting mark on the City
of Grapevine and the Grapevine Police De-
partment for many years to come.
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to recog-

In particular, our U.S. Army recruiting center
ranks number one in the nation in enlistment
rate.
To that end I would like to recognize all the
work Major Taymes has done to prepare our
Army Reserve Soldiers for success by pro-
viding them with the necessary resources and
guidance, and for his efforts to instill pride and
professionalism in the units.
He has an extensive list of military awards
and decorations including the Bronze Star, two
Meritorious Service Medals, a Joint Service
Commendation Medal, and numerous other
awards. He is a graduate of the prestigious
Harvard University.
In honoring this outstanding officer today,
we also express our deep appreciation to all
who serve, including the many in uniform from
American Samoa serving with distinction all
over the world.
In American Samoa, we’ve come to appre-
ciate Major Taymes as one of our own, and

HONORING PATRICIA WAINGER
FOR RECEIVING THE TIDEWATER
CHAPTER HUMANITARIAN
AWARD
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and recognize Patricia Wainger on re-
ceiving the 2019 Humanitarian Award for the
Tidewater Chapter of the Virginia Center for
Inclusive Communities. This is an amazing ac-
complishment.
This award recognizes Patricia’s lifetime of
service and commitment to the promotion of
respect among people of diverse back-
grounds. As the founding director of Norfolk
Academy’s Learning Bridge, an academic en-
richment program, Patricia ensured that stu-
dents have the best tools and resources to ac-
complish their long-term goals and achieve
success in their future endeavors. Through her
work at the Park Place school, she continues
to empower children, their families, and their
communities in the urban neighborhoods of
Norfolk. Students with extra preparation for
college will be well-equipped to make our
community a better place.
In addition, Patricia’s dedication to strength-
ening bonds among people of different racial,
ethnic, and religious backgrounds is truly in-
spiring. I am proud to honor and recognize
Patricia’s leadership and the role she plays in
making our community a better place. The
Tidewater Region has significantly benefited

RECOGNIZING LOUJAIN AL-
HATHLOUL
HON. LOIS FRANKEL
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, I rise in
recognition of Loujain al-Hathloul, a Saudi
women’s rights activist and political prisoner
who stands trial today in Saudi Arabia. Loujain
has been imprisoned for her political activism,
including for women’s equality under the law.
She was arrested in May 2018, along with a
dozen other peaceful women’s rights advo-
cates. These activists have been held as pris-
oners, and have reportedly faced torture and
abuse, including sexual violence, beatings,
and electric shocks.
Loujain was arrested for her advocacy on
behalf of an end to the male guardianship sys-
tem and the ban on women driving. Fighting
for women’s rights is a fundamental American
value that we have long championed world-
wide. Today marks the first day of her sham
trial. She has been denied a lawyer and any
real form of defense against the Saudi govern-
ment. The United States cannot stand by and
watch while justice and democracy are de-
valued by our partners. We must hold the
Saudi government accountable for such
human rights violations.
That is why I introduced a bipartisan resolu-
tion condemning Saudi Arabia’s continued de-
tention and alleged abuse of women’s rights
activists. Saudi Arabia must release these ad-
vocates and end the discriminatory male
guardianship system that restricts women’s
decisions about their livelihood. Let this serve
as a reminder to the world that women’s rights
are human rights.

REMEMBERING GREG JAYNES
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to remember Greg Jaynes, an elegant writer
and reporter who began his professional writ-
ing career at The Commercial Appeal in Mem-
phis covering the assassination of the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. Mr. Jaynes died March
5 in New Orleans. After Memphis, Mr. Jaynes
joined The New York Times as a foreign cor-
respondent in East Africa, based in Nairobi.
He later worked for Time, Life and The Na-
tional Geographic and wrote two well-reviewed
memoirs, Sketches from a Dirt Road and
Come Hell On High Water: A Really Sullen
Memoir, the latter about a voyage from Britain
to Tahiti aboard a Russian freighter. Describ-
ing Jaynes, one reviewer called him ‘‘irascible
but sociable, tormented and laughable, a man
whose tough, cranky exterior conceals a warm
heart and a capacity for compassion . . . We
are richer for the grace of his pen and the
strength of his high good humor.’’ I knew Greg
as a thoughtful reader and writer and agree
with the reviewer. We met when I noticed him
walking down my street in Memphis and,
shortly thereafter, returning with a copy of The
New York Times; we were neighbors. Seeing
him walking back up the street with The New
York Times was a rather unusual sight and
prompted me to introduce myself, and we be-
came friends. He was an unusually prolific
reader and was always a font of knowledge
and information. I want to extend my condo-
lences to his son Todd Jaynes and his daugh-
ter, Whitney Ann Laidlaw, his extended family
and friends and his loyal readers.

HONORING CONGRESSWOMAN
SLAUGHTER
HON. BARBARA LEE
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker,
first, I would like to thank Congressman
MCGOVERN and Congressman TONKO for lead-
ing this effort in memory of our beloved friend
and colleague Congresswoman Louise
Slaughter.
Madam Speaker, it’s almost hard to believe
it’s been a year since the passing of my dear
friend and mentor, Louise. Her death was a
monumental loss for Congress, our country,
and the world. But I know we can all find sol-
ace in the amazing legacy she left for all of
us.
Louise stayed true to the communities that
believed in her. She loved the people of Roch-
ester fiercely and fought for them with every
breath.
Right after I was elected, Louise invited me
to come with her to attend the Seneca Falls
150th anniversary in her district. She didn’t
even know me that well, but she said ‘‘Honey,
I want to be your friend and I want you to see
my district.’’ I knew right then that Louise was
something special.
A trailblazer in every respect, she made his-
tory by becoming the first woman to chair the
powerful House Rules Committee. She would
work late into the night, staying engaged and
energized no matter how late the Committee
worked. She never stopped fighting for every-
day families, children, women, and commu-
nities of color.
What I miss the most about Louise was her
humor. She was just hilarious. Ask any Mem-
ber of Congress—Republican or Democrat—
and they’ll have a story about her cracking a
joke.
Louise’s legacy will live on in the millions of
lives that she has touched and enriched. And
she will live on in the halls of Congress, where
none of us will ever forget her passion, her
grace, or her infectious sense of humor.
We all miss Louise so much.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH—HAROLD
JACKSON
HON. KATHY CASTOR
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise to honor a third-generation servant leader
from my community of Tampa, Florida, Harold
A. Jackson, Jr. who was born at Tampa Negro
Hospital to the late Jacqueline Haynes Jack-
son and the late Harold A. Jackson, Sr. Jack-
son learned about service at a young age as
his father served in the U.S. Army during
World War II and returned to Tampa to be-
come one of our hometown’s pioneering Afri-
can American civil rights attorneys and led
local desegregation efforts. His mother was a
beloved educator and retired after 33 years as
an elementary school teacher in Tampa.
Mr. Jackson followed in his parents’ foot-
steps of service and dedicated his profes-
sional life to the health and well-being of our
community. In 1978, Mr. Jackson started a 30-
year plus career with the Hillsborough County
Parks, Recreation and Conservation Depart-
ment. He rose through the ranks to become a
Recreation Area Supervisor during a time of
tremendous growth and change for this coun-
ty. He planned, organized and directed the
overall operations of community-based recre-
ation programs, which are critical in promoting
healthy, prosperous and connected commu-
nities as well as building social equity and
support for working families. During his tenure
with Hillsborough County, he continued to
build on his legacy of community service. For
27 years, he served on the board of directors
for Tampa Family Health Centers, a federally
qualified health center. He was elected chair
and vice chair of the board of directors on
several occasions. During this time, Tampa
Family Health Centers grew from one clinic to
14 and greatly expanded access to com-
prehensive health care services for hundreds
of thousands of our neighbors, especially unin-
sured or underinsured individuals.
After retiring from the Hillsborough County
Parks, Recreation and Conservation Depart-
ment, Mr. Jackson began a leadership role for
Tampa Family Health Centers as Community
Relations Liaison. He truly extends himself to
help meet the needs of the medically under-
served, whoever and wherever they are. His
efforts while serving on my 14th Congres-
sional District of Florida Puerto Rico Recovery
and Assistance Task Force were nothing short
of extraordinary and very meaningful at a time
when displaced Puerto Rican families faced
significant challenges in re-establishing their
lives following the devastating landfall of Hurri-
cane Maria in 2017. Mr. Jackson ensured fam-
ilies who relocated to Tampa had access with-
out barriers to the services of Tampa Family
Health Centers, facilitating their medical ap-
pointments to cut down on wait times with
scheduling and transportation challenges.
He is a graduate of St. Peter Claver Catho-
lic School in Tampa, a 125-year old historically
black school that today proudly continues to
provide families and students excellence in
education. Mr. Jackson returned to St. Peter
Claver to serve on the school’s board of direc-
tors and in 1994, as president of the school’s
development council, he launched a $2 million
capital campaign to establish a state-of-the-art
learning environment. Mr. Jackson also grad-
uated from Tampa Catholic High School in
1974 and went on to complete his criminal jus-
tice degree from the University of Tampa.
Mr. Jackson strongly exhibits the unequivo-
cal mark of a servant leader, one who quietly
aspires and inspires leadership by consum-
mately doing good—going the extra mile. His
contributions to community initiatives are nu-
merous—helping to launch the University Area
Community Development Corporation, co-
founding a youth council in our community that
has now grown to be one of its largest and
serving as organizer for Tampa’s largest Vet-
erans Day Parade.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful
Tampa Bay community, I am proud to recog-
nize Mr. Harold A. Jackson, Jr. for his serv-
ant’s heart and carrying forth his family’s leg-
acy of community service across the Tampa
Bay Area.

IN RECOGNITION OF MARK
O’CONNOR
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Hillsborough Police Chief Mark O’Con-
nor upon the occasion of his retirement after
a total of 33 years in law enforcement, 32 of
those years with the Town of Hillsborough.
Chief O’Connor is an uncommon law enforce-
ment professional, and the residents of
Hillsborough have been extraordinarily lucky to
have his services for over three decades.
Hillsborough is a town of 11,500 persons
nestled in the hills of the San Francisco Penin-
sula. Mark O’Connor joined the police depart-
ment of this beautiful town in 1986 after serv-
ing for a year in the Santa Clara County Sher-
iff’s Office. He began as a Police Officer and
then served as Canine Officer, Motorcycle Of-
ficer, Field Training Officer, Police Corporal,
Press Information Officer, Patrol Sergeant, Ad-
ministrative Captain, Patrol Captain and, fi-
nally, as the Chief of Police. However, Mark is
a highly talented person, and for a while the
town also tapped him to be Public Works Di-
rector. Apparently, he enjoyed catching bur-
glars more than fixing broken sewer mains, so
that stint was relatively short-lived.
Chief O’Connor served on a committee of
the San Mateo County Police Chiefs’ and
Sheriffs Association working on technology
issues and was responsible for upgrading
Hillsborough’s department to take advantage
of computers in patrol cars, officer body cam-
eras, and Computer Aided Dispatch equip-
ment, among many innovations. During Mark’s
time in charge, Hillsborough residents were
protected by the latest technology available.
As an institutional source of ‘‘lessons
learned’’ for the department, Mark excels. For
example, he once pointed out that making it
easier to navigate a community isn’t nec-
essarily good for public safety. Among its
many features, Hillsborough is a hard place to
navigate at night without a lot of experience.
Many pizzas have gone cold in the hills of
Hillsborough. Burglars would also occasionally
get lost. They would then meander repeatedly
through the town seeking frantically to escape.
The police would notice, and the thieves
would become future candidates to make pub-
lic endorsements on behalf of the Google
Maps app for smart phones—after they were
released from jail and subject to any applica-
ble terms of probation. This story illustrates
Mark’s wisdom from years of on-the-ground
experience. He is a walking library of such les-
sons.
Mark O’Connor has many obvious skills. He
is respected by his staff because he is authen-
tic. He mentors others with ease. He is smart

and has what the military calls ‘‘command
presence.’’ My office works regularly with him
on security issues that impact my office and
the broader community. He is a rock-solid
source of advice, even outside his formal job
duties.
For example, in 2010, a 30-inch high pres-
sure natural gas transmission pipeline oper-
ated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company
exploded in San Bruno, north of Hillsborough,
killing eight persons and injuring dozens more.
Mark O’Connor is a master welder. Through
the months after the explosion, he lent his
judgments to my staff and to federal and state
officials as they sought the cause of the rup-
ture. He also noticed the vulnerability of
Hillsborough and other cities to a similar dis-
aster. In part because of his recommendations
to me and to others, new pipes have been in-
stalled. Thousands have been removed from
the path of possible harm, in part due to the
insights lent by Chief Mark O’Connor.
It is Chief O’Connor’s integrity, grit, and de-
termination to be of service to all law-abiding
residents that has been the secret to his suc-
cess. It’s hard to imagine a man with such an
active mind sitting still. Maybe, he’ll write a
book about his years in law enforcement.
Hillsborough is visited regularly by Presidents,
Ambassadors and other global leaders. Mark’s
career-based police thriller might be entitled, ‘‘I
Saw The President—But He Never Saw Me.’’
It’s likely that many citizens and luminaries
never saw Mark O’Connor, but we know that
he had their backs all along their way through
the community. This, in the end, is the highest
mark of police service in any town—no flash,
just skill and professionalism. That’s Mark
O’Connor, the retiring Chief of Police of
Hillsborough, California.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH—BETTY
REED
HON. KATHY CASTOR
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor beloved community leader,
Florida State Representative Betty Reed. She
was raised in Thomasville, Georgia, in a
close-knit family of hardworking sharecroppers
and with 12 other siblings Representative
Reed and her husband, James, moved to
Tampa after he was discharged from the mili-
tary to raise a family of their own.
Representative Reed was an active parent
while her children attended school, and her in-
volvement grew over time in the Parent
Teacher Student Association, then the
Hillsborough County Council of PTSA and all
the way to the Florida State PTA.
As her children became older, she was
prompted to complete her own high school di-
ploma by attending night and weekend class-
es. Her pursuits only grew over time—she
earned an associate’s degree from
Hillsborough Community College, then her
bachelor’s degree in behavioral science from
National Louis University.
Representative Reed’s commitment to ac-
cess to education grew as a financial aid as-
sistant for Education America (which eventu-
ally became Remington College) and then as
its director of financial aid. All the while, she
was active in her own community, becoming
president of the Lucy Dell Civic Association.
But advocating for her community didn’t stop
there. She was elected as a Florida State
Representative for the 59th District, a seat she
held until she was elected to represent the
61th District in 2012.
During her tenure as a Florida State Rep-
resentative, she passed meaningful legislation,
including the Black Health Practice Initiative
(BIHPI, pronounced ‘‘Bippy’’), which passed
both chambers of the Florida Legislature with-
out a single dissenting vote. With stark dispari-
ties between the infant mortality rates of dif-
ferent races—in some areas, the rate of black
infant mortality was more than four times the
rate for whites—the legislation funded state
grants to local Healthy Start coalitions that
served counties with significant disparities:
Hillsborough, Gadsden, Palm Beach, Orange,
Broward, Duval, Putnam and Miami-Dade. The
University of South Florida and Florida Agricul-
tural & Mechanical University were selected to
provide technical assistance and scientific
guidance. BIHPI produced positive outcomes
and was particularly meaningful due to the re-
lationships built in communities with the great-
est needs. She also championed and helped
to secure state funding to help open numerous
Tampa Family Health Centers and expand the
robust safety net of comprehensive health
services to medically underserved commu-
nities. Representative Reed passed legislation
to end shackling incarcerated pregnant women
during labor, delivery as well as postpartum,
and legislation to provide additional funds to
combat homelessness throughout the state of
Florida. In her final two years, she served as
the Democratic Ranking member of the Higher
Education Appropriations Subcommittee.
Representative Reed is a compassionate
leader, who immersed herself in the chal-
lenges of her neighbors, and that allowed her
to serve as a strong advocate. Madam Speak-
er, on behalf of a grateful Tampa Bay commu-
nity, I am proud to recognize Representative
Betty Reed for her drive for meaningful
progress on behalf of our children, students,
women, families and communities across the
State of Florida.

able to put a down payment on the first home
for each of their children, laying the foundation
for a prosperous future.

life dedicated to his family, his country, and
his constituents.
Congressman Hall first served his country
as a Navy pilot during World War II. After the
war ended, he served the people of the great
state of Texas for nearly half a century; 10
years as a Texas State Senator from the 9th
district and 34 years as a Member of the U.S.
House of Representatives from Texas’s 4th
district. He genuinely enjoyed public service,
and he was good at it.
Congressman Hall and I first met and be-
came friends in the Texas State legislature.
When I was elected to the House of Rep-
resentatives, he was the first to reach out and
offer his assistance. He helped me learn the
ins and outs of Washington. No matter the
party affiliation or political leaning, Congress-
man Hall was a man that could always be
counted on—and one who enjoyed a good
joke.
Congressman Hall made the difficult deci-
sion to switch party affiliation in 2004, a move
that irritated many Democrats. I fondly recall
reaching out to him to let him know he was
still loved despite his decision. He admitted to
being so happy to hear my message because
his wife was mad at him.
Congressman Hall was known throughout
the halls of Congress as an effective legis-
lator. He made strides in science and tech-
nology policy and was a reliable advocate for
the country’s space program during his time
as both Chairman and Ranking Member of the
House Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee.
Congressman Hall’s service on the Science
Committee was a significant milestone in his
service to our nation. In many ways, he was
able to transcend the extreme partisan climate
which exists in Washington today. From the
first time we met to that last time I visited him
at his home in Rockwall, he remained the
same caring, thoughtful, humorous, and hard-
working man.
Congressman Hall was preceded in death
by his wife, Mary Ellen Murphy Hall, sister
Rosemary Hall Scott, and brother Hugh Hall.
He is survived by his three sons; Hamp, Brett,
and Blakeley Hall, and many wonderful grand-
children.
Madam Speaker, I would like to extend my
sympathy to his family, many friends across
the country, and the people of his district. The
Texas community will miss him dearly.

IN RECOGNITION OF KATHY
LEROUX
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Katharine S. Leroux for almost three
decades of outstanding public service to the
town of Hillsborough, California, the last three
years as the first female city manager. Kathy
is a remarkable community leader and a force
to be reckoned with.
After leaving her career in the telecommuni-
cation industry, Kathy started her public serv-
ice career as a water rationing coordinator in
1990, in the midst of a severe drought. She
credits that job with deeply connecting her
with Hillsborough residents. When her second
child was born in 1991, she took some time
off to focus on her family and then returned to
the city in 1992 as an account clerk in the Fi-
nance Department. In 1995, she was pro-
moted to City Clerk in which role she updated
the city council agenda process and the mu-
nicipal code. She also attained her Certified
Municipal Clerk designation.
In 2003, Kathy was promoted to Assistant to
the City Manager and then two years later to
Assistant City Manager where her responsibil-
ities increased tremendously. She oversaw the
office she formerly held, City Clerk, and
Human Resources. She led labor negotiations,
developed annual operating budgets and
served as the Acting Director for the Building
and Planning Department and the Public
Works Department when there were vacan-
cies.
Working in and with all of these depart-
ments perfectly prepared Kathy to become
City Manager and to effectively run the town’s
business. In May 2015, she became Interim
City Manager and the following January City
Manager. She maintained Hillsborough’s fiscal
stability and General Fund reserves, navigated
State mandated water use reductions, devel-
oped a process for small wire development,
revamped the website, developed the Climate
Action Plan, expanded management
teambuilding and employment recognition, and
enhanced communication with residents—an
impressive list of accomplishments that has
benefitted the town and will continue to do so
long after her retirement.
Kathy says she was afforded amazing
growth opportunities by taking two life-chang-
ing educational programs. The first one was
Continuing Education for Public Officials which
she completed in Santa Barbara in the late
1990s. The second was the Senior Executives
in State and Local Government program at the
Harvard University Kennedy School which she
completed in 2007.
During her tenure, Kathy served on several
boards including The Cities Group, San Mateo
County Telecommunications Authority, and the
Association of Bay Area Governments. She
was also the Administrative Officer for the
Central County Fire Department.
Born in San Francisco, Kathy grew up in
South San Francisco and attended El Camino
High School. She took classes at San Diego
State University, Michigan State University,
Skyline College and the College of San Mateo
and then spent three years working in the pri-
vate sector for PacTel InfoSystems in San
Francisco.
Kathy and Bert, her husband of 32 years,
are devoted parents of Louie and Victoria. In
her well-deserved retirement, Kathy plans to
remodel her San Bruno house, adopt a dog,
take golf lessons and spend more time read-
ing, cooking and traveling.
Madam Speaker, I ask the members of the
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Katharine Leroux, an exemplary public
servant and dear friend, who leaves behind
big shoes to fill for the next City Manager of
Hillsborough. Her contributions to the town
over the last 28 years will be felt for years to
come.

Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize and honor the late Anne Shumadine
for receiving the 2019 Corporate VOLUNTEER
Excellence Award through Volunteer Hampton
Roads, in memoriam.
This award recognizes Anne’s lifetime of
hard work and service to the community. Her
dedication to her company and to her commu-
nity was truly inspiring. Anne founded a highly
competitive firm and led a group of advisors in
the service of ensuring that clients have their
financial needs met. Anne’s dedication to offer
the best financial strategic and philanthropic
planning stood out.
In addition to Anne’s dedication to her work,
she held multiple leadership roles in the
Hampton Roads community, including the
President of the Norfolk Day Nursery Associa-
tion, the President of the ACCESS College

made our community a better place.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH—JUEL
SMITH
HON. KATHY CASTOR
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the living legacy of Dr. Juel
Smith. Her story starts in Sapulpa, Oklahoma,
where she was born and graduated from
Sapulpa High School in 1960. She married
and became a mother of five children. Trag-
edy struck her and her family when her hus-
band suddenly passed away, and Dr. Smith
became a widow. She realized that pursuing
higher education was her best shot for her to
secure a better future for her family. Dr. Smith
persevered and earned her degree in elemen-
tary education in 1972 from Langston Univer-
sity, Oklahoma’s only historically Black col-
lege. Dr. Smith relocated to Tampa and re-
ceived her master’s degree and education
specialist degree with a thesis on ‘‘Women
Who Combine Career and Family,’’ a field of
study in which she was personally invested. In
1987, she received her doctorate in counselor
education from the University of South Florida
(USF).
Always fueled by her faith and persever-
ance, Dr. Smith has been driven to serve oth-
ers and find solutions. As a counselor at USF,
she started her life’s work helping and guiding
students, particularly African American stu-
dents who could not afford to continue their
education. She engaged Tampa’s African
American community to ‘‘give more, do more
and help more’’ to recruit and retain students.
She created the Institute on Black Life in 1986
and the Center for Africa and the Diaspora,
with a mission to bridge USF’s resources with
the needs of the Black community and Africa
as well as provide support for Black students
and faculty. The Institute on Black Life pro-
duced an annual Black family conference, the
campus Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday
celebrations each year and a weekly television
show titled ‘‘The Bridge.’’ The Institute also
sponsored nationally renowned guest speak-
ers and artists. As a partner with the Urban
League, they established an African American
advisory board and inner-city office to plan
strategies and share problems. Student en-
richment programs, scholarships, graduate fel-
lowships, faculty research, community service
and fundraising activities resulted. The African
center sponsored international faculty research
travel to Gabon that resulted in a USF and
International Center for Bantu Civilization col-
laboration. Dr. Smith’s effectiveness in com-
munity relations, organizing special campus
initiatives and philanthropic fundraising were
unmatched at other Florida colleges and uni-
versities.
In the early 2000s, motivated by research
regarding the desire of professional women to
support female students, Dr. Smith and USF
leaders launched a vision and plan to estab-
lish the USF Women in Leadership and Phi-
lanthropy program. Dr. Smith served as WLP’s
founding executive director. The initiative
raised an extraordinary amount of money in
the first 18 months to create scholarships and
programmatic initiatives for women faculty and
students. In addition, Dr. Smith became the
first African American woman to serve as
president of the Tampa Athena Society. She is
a trustee of the Community Foundation of
Tampa Bay, Inc. and a life member of Alpha
Kappa Alpha Sorority. In addition to her local
involvement, she served as international direc-
tor of The LINKS, Inc., building more than 50
schools in South Africa and Nigeria, and
served with President Jimmy Carter on the
International Habitat for Humanity Board.
Her beloved husband, Professor John
Smith, ensured her living legacy by estab-
lishing the Dr. Juel Hickman Shannon Smith
Endowed Scholarship. The scholarship is de-
signed to support full-time undergraduate stu-
dents pursuing a major in Africana studies or
elementary education.
Dr. Smith’s legacy of enhancing student,
faculty and community opportunities, pas-
sionate endeavors that are now part of USF’s
fabric, will live on through the students and
educators who have more opportunities due to
her leadership. Madam Speaker, on behalf of
a grateful Tampa Bay community, I am proud
to recognize Dr. Juel Smith for her lifelong ex-
emplary service to education, students,
women and leaders in education everywhere.

HONORING DREW UNGVARSKY FOR
RECEIVING THE 2019 HARVEY L.
LINDSAY, JR. CHANGEMAKER
AWARD
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, March 13, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and recognize Drew Ungvarsky for re-
ceiving the 2019 Harvey L. Lindsay, Jr.
Changemaker Award through Volunteer
Hampton Roads. This is an amazing accom-
plishment.
This award recognizes Drew’s many years
of hard work and innovative accomplishments.
His dedication transformed an idea into a
highly competitive company while simulta-
neously giving back to the Hampton Roads
community. I am inspired by Drew’s commit-
ment to support local businesses and char-
ities. By renting out his company’s work space
for ‘‘pop ups,’’ and requiring each ‘‘pop up’’ to
donate some of the proceeds to charity, he
demonstrates the true meaning of a change-
maker. Drew’s innovative and thoughtful busi-
ness ideas are not simply benefiting his com-
pany, but the entire Hampton Roads commu-
nity.
I want to thank Drew for his leadership in
the digital sphere and the role he plays in
making the community a better place. Hamp-
ton Roads has significantly benefited from his
leadership.
