SUPPORT COLLEGE
AFFORDABILITY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) for 5 minutes.
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in strong support of H.R. 4674,
the College Affordability Act. I am
proud to be an original cosponsor of
this comprehensive reauthorization of
the Higher Education Act.
The Federal role in education is cen-
tered on equity. When we promote and
realize equity in education, when we
expand and invest in educational op-
portunities, we can improve outcomes
for all students, at all levels.
President Johnson signed the first
Higher Education Act into law in 1965,
more than 50 years ago. The goal was
to make certain that no student is de-
nied a college education because of a
lack of resources. At that time, Presi-
dent Johnson said: ‘‘This act means the
path of knowledge is open to all that
have the determination to walk it.’’
We have made some progress over the
past 50-plus years. But for many stu-
dents, especially first-generation and
low-income students and many stu-
dents of color, they have the deter-
mination, but there are still too many
barriers for them to overcome.
I am glad this bill addresses those
barriers and includes several of my
longtime priorities, informed by con-
versations I have had with students,
community colleges, colleges, and uni-
versities across my home State of Or-
egon. These priorities include strength-
ening financial counseling for student
borrowers and modernizing the Federal
work-study program to direct re-
sources to students who need it most.
I have also heard from numerous stu-
dent loan borrowers in northwest Or-
egon who describe loan repayment as
anxiety-inducing, daunting, and over-
whelming, which is why I have in-
cluded language in the College Afford-
ability Act to help protect many bor-
rowers from default by getting and
keeping them in manageable, income-
driven repayment plans.
Also, unfortunately, I have heard
that housing and food insecurity are
prevalent for too many students across
this country. This bill includes lan-
guage I authored, along with my Edu-
cation and Labor Committee colleague
Representative TAKANO, to address the
issue of food insecurity by making sure
that students who are eligible for
SNAP are aware of their eligibility and
have the support they need to secure
those benefits.
The College Affordability Act also in-
creases Pell grant funding, supports
school-based childcare centers, pro-
vides stronger accountability measures
for institutions, creates an emergency
grant program for students who en-
counter unexpected financial barriers,
and makes urgently needed improve-
ments to the public service loan for-
giveness program.
I am proud of the work that the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee has done
in crafting the College Affordability
Act. I am grateful to Chairman SCOTT
for his leadership. I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this crucial legisla-
tion when it comes to the floor as we
continue our work to make college af-
fordable and equitable for everyone.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL RURAL
HEALTH DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
November 21 as National Rural Health
Day.
Nearly 60 million Americans call
rural America home. It is a great place
to live, to work, and to raise a family.
To ensure the vitality and vibrancy
of rural America, investments in infra-
structure, technology, and healthcare
are critical. Americans in every corner
of the Nation deserve access to reli-
able, quality healthcare, but rural
America faces its own unique health
challenges that need to be addressed.
Sadly, rural Americans are more
likely than those in urban areas to die
prematurely from heart disease, can-
cer, unintentional injury, chronic
lower respiratory disease, and stroke,
the Nation’s five leading causes of
death.
Rural America is no stranger to
healthcare struggles, including long

distances to the closest hospital, many
uninsured or underinsured residents,
and a larger number of aging residents
with chronic conditions.
Another issue is simply the lack of
doctors and providers. There are only
40 physicians for every 100,000 people in
rural America. This leads to unserved
patients and overworked medical pro-
fessionals.
One way to address these issues is
through telemedicine. Telemedicine
can reduce healthcare barriers, in-
crease access, and bolster convenience
for millions of Americans.
Telemedicine is critical in ensuring
increased access to care for Americans
who live many miles away from a hos-
pital or a doctor’s office. It can also
make a difference in the lives of lim-
ited-mobility Americans, like those
who may be elderly or living with dif-
ferent types of disabilities.
Another way to improve the health
of rural Americans who may be consid-
ered low-income is to address out-of-
pocket costs for Medicaid expenses.
Something that needs to be addressed
for seniors in not only rural America
but also across the country is the mis-
use of direct and indirect remunera-
tion, or DIR, and how it has impacted
the part D drug plans. Over the years,
DIR has become a catchall for phar-
macy fees, which has unfairly shifted
additional costs onto Medicaid pa-
tients.
While progress has been made with
the 2018 Medicare part D pricing rule,
there is still much more to be done.
That is why I cosponsored H.R. 1034,
the Phair Pricing Act. This bill di-
rectly addresses necessary reforms to
DIR fees by doing four key things.
First, the Phair Pricing Act will re-
quire all price concessions between a
pharmacy and a pharmacy benefits
manager be included at the point of
sale to decrease patient costs.
Second, the bill will realign market
incentives to ensure patients have ac-
cess to and receive the best possible
care.
Third, the Phair Pricing Act will di-
rect the Secretary of Health and
Human Services to establish a working
group of stakeholders to create quality
measures based on a pharmacy’s prac-
tice.
Lastly, the bill would ensure phar-
macy benefits managers disclose all
fees, price concessions, and programs
to the Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services.
Mr. Speaker, rural Americans de-
serve the best medical care available,
and we can improve options for them
and for all Americans through com-
monsense, bipartisan solutions like in-
vestments in telemedicine and legisla-
tion like the Phair Pricing Act.

STREAMLINING NATURAL
DISASTER RESPONSE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise because I love my coun-
try, and I rise today with a very special
message concerning some of the disas-
ters that confront us in this country.
I rise because, last night, this House
passed H.R. 3702. This was a piece of
legislation designed to deal with emer-
gency management after these disas-
ters. It is styled the Reforming Dis-
aster Recovery Act of 2019.
This is an important piece of legisla-
tion that passed, and because it has
passed the House, it is most appro-
priate that we do several things. The
first is to acknowledge the support
that it had in the House and give
thanks to those who have supported
the legislation. I have to thank all the
290 Members of this House who voted to
support this legislation—290 Members.
It was bipartisan.
Mrs. ANN WAGNER was the Repub-
lican lead on this bill, and she did great
work in bringing along the bipartisan
effort that was necessary to pass the
legislation—Mrs. ANN WAGNER, a co-
sponsor of the legislation to deal with
natural disasters.
I would also like to thank my chair-
woman of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, the Honorable MAXINE WATERS,
who fought fearlessly to help us get
this passed.
But I cannot do this without ac-
knowledging the ranking member, the
Honorable Mr. MCHENRY, who also
fought to get it passed. In fact, it
passed out of the committee unani-
mously because of WATERS and
MCHENRY, and because of the Honor-
able ANN WAGNER. It passed out of the
committee unanimously.
The bill came to the floor, and again,
290 of the Members of this Congress
voted for it. I salute all the persons
who helped to make this possible.
Just a quick word about the bill, and
5 minutes is not nearly enough to
thank all the people associated with it.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
a long list of persons, not the least of
which, of course, will be the staff.
Rep. Wagner, Chair Waters and Ranking
Member McHenry, Leaders Hoyer and
McCarthy, Democratic and Republican Staff,
Office of Inspector General, Department of
Housing and Urban Development; Secretary
of Housing and Urban Development Dr. Ben
Carson, Chair DeFazio and Ranking Member
Sam Graves, Chair Lowey and Ranking
Member Kay Granger, Houston Mayor Syl-
vester Turner, Harris County Judge Hidalgo,
Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis,
Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia.

Service.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
the staff really worked diligently and
tirelessly to get this bill passed as well.
But the bill itself, after natural dis-
asters in this country, we have been
relegated to starting a process to ac-
cord various areas in the country that
are impacted funding to help them re-
build, to help them restore order to
their lives.
In doing this, we have not codified
the methodology by which we would
perfect the assistance that is needed.
We never codified it. Twenty-six years
ago, HUD received the responsibility to
respond, but we didn’t give any codified
rules.
The HUD OIG indicated that there
was a necessity to codify some rules so
that we could respond in a timely man-
ner but, also, do it in an efficacious
manner such that we would not re-
invent the wheel each and every time,
which is what we have been doing, rein-
venting the wheel.
Well, this bill does that. It codifies
the whole process of dealing with man-
agement after a disaster.
FEMA deals with the emergency side
of it, in terms of an immediate re-
sponse, providing persons with some-
place to live, providing persons with
the necessities of life. But the long-
term response is what HUD deals with.
Under this long-term response legis-
lation that we passed yesterday, HUD
now can work with municipalities di-
rectly, in some cases. If a municipality
has demonstrated that it can handle
large sums of money, then funding can
go from the Congress to the munici-
pality, as opposed to some other agen-
cy within the State and then trickle
down to that municipality.
Houston, Texas, by way of example,
has demonstrated that it can handle
these large sums of money. They have
a great accounting department. Mayor
Turner is there, and he has done an
outstanding job.
With this kind of opportunity to get
direct funding, people will receive help
more efficaciously. They will receive it
immediately.
Also, in small areas of the country,
small cities, they will get a better un-
derstanding of how they can approach
this process and how they can get the
funding accorded them in a faster way.
The bill really is something that has
been needed, not only for the hurri-
canes and the flooding but also for the
tornadic activities, for the earthquakes
that will visit some parts of the coun-
try, and for the fires that we will have.
This legislation is meaningful, and I
will say more about it in the future.

MOVING IMPEACHMENT
GOALPOSTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BYRNE) for 5 minutes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8963
November 19, 2019
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, unfortu-
nately, I must rise again because, like
so many times before, the goalposts for
impeaching President Trump have
moved. At this rate, NANCY PELOSI
must be any field goal kicker’s worst
nightmare.
Since literally day one, it has been
abundantly clear that the far-left
members of a so-called squad have been
moving this Democratic majority clos-
er to impeaching the President. They
don’t care why or how. They don’t care
what evidence, real or imagined, is
used. They care only about the end re-
sult: impeaching President Trump so
that he will not win reelection.
As this radical faction gains domi-
nance in the Democratic Party, Speak-
er PELOSI has tried every justification
in the book to impeach this President.
We were told for years that we would
get to impeachment from the Mueller
report. They said just wait, wait till
the report. It is going to show Russian
collusion.
Well, 2 years and millions of dollars
down the drain, Mueller showed no col-
lusion.
b 1015
The Democrat narrative quickly
turned towards ‘‘obstruction of jus-
tice,’’ but that, too, fell flat.
But then, Mr. Speaker, the majority
got a new gift, the whistleblower.
Never mind he had no firsthand knowl-
edge of what he blew the whistle on;
never mind he is a partisan Democrat;
never mind he worked with ADAM
SCHIFF on his new allegations against
President Trump.
It was campaign finance violations.
Well, that didn’t work. So then it was
quid pro quo. For weeks, that is all the
majority talked about.
Not anymore. Apparently, Mr.
Speaker, some highly paid political
consultants warned Speaker PELOSI
that quid pro quo did not resonate with
the American people. So now it seems
they have moved on to another version
of impeachment that tested best in
their focus groups, the nefarious-
sounding ‘‘bribery.’’ It is bribery. That
is what we will impeach President
Trump on.
Well, Mr. Speaker, I think my friends
on the other side need to dust off their
law books because, unfortunately for
their latest impeachment fantasy, brib-
ery isn’t just some word. It is a real
crime with a real definition, and it is
one this majority cannot prove.
You see, bribery occurs when an indi-
vidual ‘‘corruptly’’ links receiving
something of value in exchange for an
official government action.
I say to the majority, show me how
asking Ukraine to look into the 2016
election and into the sketchy dealings
of Hunter Biden is acting corruptly.
Because I will tell you what: I will
show you evidence that Ukrainian offi-
cials were working to boost Secretary
Clinton, and I will show you evidence
that the Obama administration itself
was concerned about Hunter Biden’s
deals.
I think most Americans will say
maybe the President of the United
States should be looking into these
things. I think they will say we want
the President looking into possible cor-
ruption in our government and inter-
ference in our elections.
More importantly, I say to the ma-
jority, show me how President Trump
linked aid to these investigations.
Mr. Speaker, President Trump’s
phone call with Ukraine’s President
Zelensky—you know, the one that the
whistleblower blew the whistle on—it
is on the internet. Everyone can read
it, and I hope that they will, because
nowhere in that call did President
Trump ever link any aid to Ukraine in
exchange for anything. The President
did not one time—not one time—even
mention any kind of hold on the aid,
not once.
This is not bribery. This is not im-
peachable conduct. Yet here we are
trying to remove the President of the
United States, the leader of this coun-
try, the man chosen by the voters, over
these newest allegations.
Mr. Speaker, the American people
see past this charade. They know that
this is a partisan political scheme. And
at this point, I think most people who
are paying attention, those who
haven’t tuned out, know this is just the
latest effort by Democrats to throw
something at the wall and see it if
sticks.
President Trump has committed no
‘‘bribery, treason, or high crimes and
misdemeanors’’ the only offenses that
the Constitution says warrant im-
peachment.
I ask the majority, when do we stop
and get back to the business of the
American people?

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I am
proud to represent the Third Congres-
sional District of Ohio. Unfortunately,
my district, the State, and the Nation
are no stranger to senseless gun vio-
lence, lack of affordable housing, and
quality healthcare.
I rise today, again, to say enough is
enough.
I rise to mourn the 13,200 men,
women, and children who have been
victims of gun violence this year.
The time for only thoughts and pray-
ers is over. It is time for serious, hard-
hitting policy and change. I call on my
colleagues to support my legislation,
H.R. 287, the SAFER Now Act.
Safer America for Everyone Right
Now is comprehensive and pulls to-
gether the most forward-thinking poli-
cies in one package. It would, Mr.
Speaker, require background checks,
prohibit the sale of semiautomatic as-
sault weapons, make trafficking in
firearms a stand-alone criminal of-
fense, prohibit the possession of fire-
arms by a person who has been con-
victed of stalking, and bans bump
stocks.
Let’s pass this bill and the two gun
reform bills already waiting on Senate
action.
My first-ever floor speech, when
elected to Congress, was on gun vio-
lence. Since then, I sponsored and
helped sponsor and pass commonsense
gun laws, proudly received an F rating
from the NRA, participated in the 24-
hour gun reform sit-in, marched with
Moms Demand Action and stood with
Students Demand Action for gun re-
form, and more.
I am calling on the Governor of Ohio,
city mayors, State representatives,
city council, community leaders, and
others to demand action to make our
communities safer, get guns off the
street, train and put neighborhood po-
lice back in our communities, call
upon the soon-to-be new police chief of
Columbus to first patrol our inner-city
neighborhoods, know our community,
hold police officers accountable, and
support reducing gun violence—because
enough is enough.
LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, lack of
affordable housing is an issue.
The Columbus area is the most ex-
pensive region for housing in Ohio. A
person would have to work a minimum
wage of over $18 per hour to afford a
two-bedroom apartment. We are fight-
ing to only get a $15-per-hour minimum
wage.
I recently convened an Affordable
Housing Summit to discuss this crit-
ical issue with 36 stakeholders, toured
the district, and, in that evening, was
joined by some 400 constituents to have
a community conversation, hearing
firsthand from them about affordable
housing issues.
We know that young people and Afri-
can Americans are disproportionately
affected by this housing shortage. Too
many young people, too many seniors,
too many veterans, and too many fami-
lies are facing homelessness.
Columbus and our suburban areas are
continuing to grow. We need to ensure
that all of our residents can grow and
prosper.
Call to action: I recently passed a bill
for FHA first-time home buyers to get
a reduction on their mortgage insur-
ance for taking a financial literacy
course. It passed the House. Now let’s
call on the Senate to pass it.
We must increase the supply of equi-
table opportunities to access affordable
housing, call on the banks to design
CRA projects with their bank-owned
houses, raise bond financing, expand
abatement housing buyouts, increase
Federal funding, hire a housing czar in
my district, and support State housing
tax credits.
I will continue to work with stake-
holders to address this affordable hous-
ing crisis.
AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTHCARE

today, I rise for access to affordable
and quality healthcare for my con-
stituents and all Americans: Too many

constituents do not get the care they
need due to skyrocketing costs. Too
many seniors can’t afford their pre-
scriptions, and they are cutting their
pills in half to stretch their medicine.
Too many young people cannot afford
the insurance premiums to even get ac-
cess to a doctor.
At the beginning of this Congress, I
met with stakeholders in my district
to solicit their help. I will continue to
support the Affordable Care Act and
oppose Republicans’ attempts to dis-
mantle this critical legislation, be-
cause if Republicans had their way,
nearly 30 million Americans would lose
their healthcare—an unconscionable
and sobering statistic.
I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 3, the
Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
Mr. Speaker, I am fighting for the
people of the Third Congressional Dis-
trict of Ohio.

CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE JANE PAULEY
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate The Jane Pauley Com-
munity Health Center, with locations
across Indiana, on 10 years of helping
patients of all ages and backgrounds in
need of care.
Founded in 2009, these healthcare
centers continue to service commu-
nities across the Sixth District, pro-
viding affordable healthcare to Hoo-
siers. The Jane Pauley Community
Centers embody the spirit of humanity
and altruism by serving those in need,
regardless of the patients’ ability to
pay.
Congratulations on a decade of serv-
ice.
CONGRATULATING THE NEW CASTLE HIGH
SCHOOL WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL TEAM
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize the New Castle High School
women’s volleyball team for winning
the 2019 class 4A State volleyball
championship. This marks New Cas-
tle’s third year in a row on achieving
this tremendous victory.
The coaching staff and players’ hard
work have brought pride to the New
Castle community. Congratulations to
the Trojans, and a great job on the
three-peat.
CONGRATULATING THE GREENFIELD-CENTRAL
HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Greenfield-Central
High School marching band for win-
ning the class B Indiana State cham-
pionship.
I recently visited Greenfield-Central
High School and was able to meet some
of the band members and see their in-
credible facilities firsthand. The 160-
member Cougar Pride Marching Band
spent hours every day working toward
this goal, and it is an accomplishment
they are sure to remember for the rest
of their lives.
I congratulate the Cougars on their
awesome achievement.
CONGRATULATING BARBARA HINKLE
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize Barbara Hinkle of Conners-
ville for receiving the Archbishop Ed-
ward T. O’Meara Respect Life Award.
As a member of the St. Gabriel par-
ish, Barbara started the Compassionate
Visitors and Vigil Keepers Group,
which serves local nursing homes. Bar-
bara started the group to bring, as she
said, ‘‘joy and hope to the lonely and
peace and comfort to the dying.’’
I congratulate Barbara on her award
and thank her for her servant’s heart.
CONGRATULATING MUNCIE PUBLIC LIBRARY
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to express my appreciation for the
Muncie Public Library receiving the
Historic Preservation Education Grant.
The funds from Indiana Humanities,
in cooperation with the National En-
dowment for the Humanities, will be
used to help the library share its his-
tory and preservation needs with the
public.
Carnegie Library was the first li-
brary building in Muncie and one of the
first to be built in Indiana on a full do-
nation from Andrew Carnegie. This fa-
cility serves as an icon of history and
a modern workspace and receives my
full support in Congress.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
AMERICORPS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. BERA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise
to talk about one of the great service-
based programs in America, the
AmeriCorps program.
Since 1994, more than 1.1 million
Americans have served in AmeriCorps.
Today, more than 75,000 AmeriCorps
members serve each year at over 21,000
locations across the country, including
nonprofits, schools, public education
agencies, and community and faith-
based groups.
AmeriCorps members come from all
across this country. They are young
men and women looking to learn lead-
ership and give back to our country
and our communities.
They serve critical needs like fight-
ing poverty, sustaining national parks,
responding to and preparing for disas-
ters, and mentoring youth.
They mobilize and coordinate mil-
lions of volunteers to serve alongside
them, which promotes a lasting impact
on the volunteers and the communities
that they serve.
I was recently fortunate to speak at
the induction ceremony for the
AmeriCorps National Civilian Commu-
nity Corps, one of three AmeriCorps
programs. AmeriCorps NCCC members
are assigned to one of four regional
campuses, one being Sacramento, Cali-
fornia, the district I represent.
Before becoming AmeriCorps mem-
bers, the inductees have to take the
AmeriCorps member pledge; and, as I
read that pledge, I thought this is
something that we ought to think
about as Members of Congress.
Mr. Speaker, let me read that pledge
to you right now. It says:
I will get things done for America, to make
our people safer, smarter, and healthier.
I will bring Americans together to
strengthen our communities.
Faced with apathy, I will take action.
Faced with conflict, I will seek common
ground.
Faced with adversity, I will persevere.
I will carry this commitment with me this
year and beyond.
I am an AmeriCorps member, and I will get
things done.
Imagine, if these young Americans
can take that pledge, what if we just
changed that last line to ‘‘I am a Mem-
ber of Congress, and I will get things
done’’?
We can learn something from these
young people. Let’s come together as a
body. Let’s emulate what we are teach-
ing that next generation, and let’s get
things done, Congress.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL
ADOPTION AWARENESS MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize November as Na-
tional Adoption Awareness Month.
According to the Adoption Network,
one out of every 25 families in the
United States has an adopted child.
That means adoption has directly
touched the lives of one-third of the
U.S. population.
Yet, despite the widespread impact of
adoption, many more children still
need a loving home. The average child
waits for an adoptive family for more
than 3 years, and nearly 115,000 chil-
dren are waiting to find their forever
home. We can do better.
Many barriers prevent these children
from being placed in loving homes.
They include the high and often unpre-
dictable cost of adoption, and families
and birth mothers simply not having
enough information about the option of
adoption.
To reduce these barriers and help
support increased adoption placement,
I recently introduced the Improving
Adoption Outcomes and Affordability
Act. My legislation provides assistance
to State or local governments, public
and private adoption agencies, faith-
based organizations, and eligible non-
profits for the purpose of improving
adoption education, providing prebirth
counseling assistance to birth mothers
choosing adoption, and helping to
cover mental health or substance abuse
treatments to mothers struggling with
addiction and other personal chal-
lenges during pregnancy.
Not only will this increased edu-
cation and counseling improve the out-
come of the adoption for both birth

mothers and adopting families, but it
will also provide more pricing stability
to the overall fees that families pay
during an adoption. Adoptions often
cost tens of thousands of dollars, which
is a financial impediment to families
making this life-affirming choice. In-
jecting more price predictability into
the adoption system may be the help
that families need when making the
decision to adopt.
Last Congress, bipartisan legislation
that I introduced to reduce known bar-
riers for foster placement was signed
into law. This bill builds on that effort
to improve adoption outcomes, and we
all will remain committed to ensuring
that every child has the opportunity to
grow up in a safe and loving home.
RECOGNIZING ANN LETORT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker I rise
today to congratulate the faculty,
staff, and students of Ann LeTort Ele-
mentary School in the Penn Manor
School District on being recognized as
the 2019–2020 National Blue Ribbon
School.
Mr. Speaker, the National Blue Rib-
bon Schools program was founded near-
ly 40 years ago to recognize out-
standing public and private schools,
who are making a difference and exem-
plify excellence. LeTort Elementary
was recognized as an Exemplary
Achievement Gap Closing School.
I would like to thank Penn Manor su-
perintendent Dr. Michael Leichliter,
the Penn Manor School Board, and the
leadership and teachers at Ann LeTort
Elementary for working very hard for
this achievement. We know how a qual-
ity education prepares students for
success throughout the rest of their
lives.
Mr. Speaker, in their application for
recognition, school principal Mrs.
Carly McPherson notes that, ‘‘it is evi-
dent how individuals throughout the
community are vested in the education
of every LeTort student.’’
Mr. Speaker, I thank and congratu-
late that community for making a dif-
ference in the lives of their students
and for being recognized as a National
Blue Ribbon School.

RECOGNIZING ALABAMA’S 200TH
ANNIVERSARY OF STATEHOOD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Alabama (Mrs. ROBY) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to highlight an important time in Ala-
bama’s history.
I am proud to lead the efforts joined
by my colleagues from Alabama in in-
troducing a resolution today, which
honors the 200th anniversary of Ala-
bama’s statehood.
On December 14, 1819, Alabama was
incorporated into the Union as the 22nd
State. December 14, 2019, will mark 200
years since the historical day of our
State’s incorporation. This is a monu-
mental occasion in our State’s history,
and we are looking forward to joining
Alabamians in a year full of memo-
rable celebration and commemoration
of the bicentennial.
It is my greatest honor to represent
and serve the people of Alabama’s Sec-
ond Congressional District, which in-
cludes Montgomery, our State’s capital
city. Alabama is currently experi-
encing extreme economic development
and job growth across the State, which
makes this special time even more ex-
citing for us all.
I join my colleagues in recognizing
this milestone in our State’s history. I
am grateful to have the opportunity to
serve the people of Alabama as we cele-
brate the birthday and history of the
beloved State we all call home.

RESPONDING TO RAIL-BASED
INCIDENTS
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, last weekend, a train derailed
in Niagara Falls, New York, tossing
several cars filled with butane on their
side within yards of neighborhoods,
residences, and local restaurants.
The Niagara Falls Fire Department
and Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station
responded quickly and, fortunately,
this time, the emergency didn’t rise to
the level of placing the community in
great danger.
According to the United States De-
partment of Transportation, over 1,300
train derailments took place in 2018
alone, leaving no doubt that situations
like this will occur again.
That is why I have introduced, along
with Congresswoman HERRERA
BEUTLER, the Fire Department Proper
Response and Equipment Prioritization
Act. This bipartisan legislation ensures
that our brave first responders have ac-
cess to Federal grants that support the
specialized training and equipment
necessary to respond to rail-based inci-
dents, making the safety of our com-
munities a priority.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to address the critical need to
pass the USMCA, a trade agreement for
the 21st century. The USMCA would
expand our markets, add $63 billion to
the economy, and create 176,000 new
jobs, with thousands of those jobs com-
ing to Minnesota.
When I am back in Minnesota’s
Eighth Congressional District meeting
farmers, workers, and businessmen and
-women alike, I am often asked why
Congress has not yet passed the
USMCA, even though it was signed by
the President nearly a year ago. And
my answer is this: If we voted on the
USMCA today, it would pass the House
with strong bipartisan support.
Unfortunately, Democratic leader-
ship’s refusal to bring this critical
trade agreement to the House floor for
a vote continues, and uncertainty re-
mains for millions of Americans.
Pursuing partisan impeachment
rather than clinching bipartisan wins
for the American worker, is not what a
majority of the American people sent
us here to do. Enough is enough. I urge
Democratic leadership to stop playing
politics and join the rest of us in work-
ing for the American people.
The time to pass the USMCA is now.
f
LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUG
PRICES
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, the number
one issue that my constituents have
asked me to address is the price of
healthcare and, especially, the cost of
prescription drugs. It is long past time
for commonsense legislation to end the
ban on price negotiation for drugs for
our Nation’s Medicare patients.
This one action will hold Big Pharma
accountable and encourage more com-
petition. That is why the special inter-
ests have opposed H.R. 3, because it
forces them to lower their prices for
U.S. patients.
We can use the money saved to lower
premiums, cap out-of-pocket costs for
our Nation’s seniors, and invest in the
National Institutes of Health’s life-
saving research and innovation.
These are decisions that impact real
people. Take my constituent from
Rosemount. He has Crohn’s disease and
takes a medication called Canasa.
When he started taking the drug, it
was $100 for a 30-day supply. Over the
past 10 years, that has skyrocketed to
$1,500 a month. In Canada, that same
drug costs $75 a month.
It is time to stop talking and take
action.

JUVENILE DIABETES RESEARCH
FOUNDATION ONE WALK
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, on Saturday, I walked in the
Juvenile Diabetes Research Founda-
tion One Walk at Segra Park, home of
the famous Columbia Fireflies. I am
grateful to have been able to support
such an important cause and walk in
support of eradicating type 1 diabetes.
The money raised at the JDRF One
Walk in Columbia supports life-chang-
ing research that gives hope to those
impacted by type 1 diabetes. It is an
autoimmune disease that strikes sud-
denly and is serious and stressful to
families, challenging families across
our district.
Currently, there is nothing that can
be done to prevent type 1 diabetes and
there is no cure. JDRF is a leader in
funding diabetes research, motivated
by their vision of a world without type
1 diabetes. This organization works
tirelessly to improve the lives of those
affected by this disease by accelerating
life-changing breakthroughs to cure,
prevent, and treat diabetes.
I appreciate JDRF Palmetto Chapter
Development Director Beth McCrary
for her hard work and success in co-
ordinating the JDRF Walk in Columbia
and for her advocacy for ending type 1
diabetes.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT
THROUGH DECEMBER 20, 2019
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in strong support of the con-
tinuing resolution to fund our govern-
ment.
Unfortunately, it breaks my heart
that we have not been able to do our
job and reach a consensus on a budget,
but we will not be shutting down our
government. The bill ensures that the
Federal Government does not shut
down a week before Americans cele-
brate Thanksgiving with their families,
preventing countless Federal employ-
ees from being forced to work without
a paycheck.
For my home State of Michigan, this
continuing resolution repeals section
1438 of the FAST Act, which would re-
scind over $7 billion in highway fund-
ing from the States. This repeal would
protect over $300 million in critical
funding for Michigan, which is needed
for our highways.
I am also thrilled that the continuing
resolution provides a 3 percent pay in-
crease for our Nation’s servicemembers
who devote their lives to protecting
our Nation.
While the House and Senate use this
additional month to continue negoti-
ating complete fiscal year funding, I
urge the Senate to include House lan-
guage that would include increased
funding for maternal mortality, envi-
ronmental protection, and programs
that give women and families a better
chance.
f
DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVER-
TISING COSTS IN THE UNITED
STATES
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I would like to bring aware-
ness today to a challenge that most
Americans face every day with the
high cost of their prescribed medica-
tions.
Since 2010, the practicing cost of
drugs in the United States has risen by
close to 10 percent per year. As a physi-
cian, I see patients who forgo their
medications because they simply can-
not afford them.
In 1996, the United States’ use of di-
rect-to-consumer advertising began a
skyrocketing climb such that, today, 8
out of the top 10 pharmaceutical com-
panies in the U.S. spend more on adver-
tising than they do on research, per-
sonnel, or manufacturing. In fact, we
are only one of two countries in the
world that allow this practice, and this
is a major reason why we have the
highest cost of medications in the
world.
As a physician, I am often put in the
unenviable position of explaining to a
patient why the drug they see on TV is
not the right drug for them and why.
Patients ask their doctor about this
medication, only for them to receive
entirely different advice from their
physician who diagnoses their illness.
Yes, I am an ardent supporter of free
speech, yet I would ask the American
public: Is it worth it to you to pay up
to 25 percent more for your medica-
tions just to see them advertised on
television?
So rather than investing billions of
dollars in advertising, pharmaceutical
companies could be decreasing the cost
of medications or using that money for
cure research.
I ask for bipartisan support of this
measure.

LEGAL IMMIGRATION MAKES OUR
COUNTRY GREAT
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1

marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to showcase why legal immigration
makes our country great.
Earlier this month, I had the oppor-
tunity to give a keynote address at a
naturalization ceremony for new U.S.
citizens. I awarded 68 new Americans
with their citizenship certificates and
spoke with their families and their
loved ones. Being a part of that cere-
mony reinforced my patriotism and my
belief in our country.
We want the best and the brightest
from around the world to come to our

shores, and we want them to do it the
right way. That is part of the Amer-
ican story.
So let no one claim that being tough
on illegal immigration has to mean
that you in any way oppose immi-
grants. It is actually quite the oppo-
site. We want people to come to the
United States the American way, the
legal way, so they can pursue their
American Dream.

REMEMBERING THE GETTYSBURG
ADDRESS
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to remember
President Lincoln’s famous remarks in
Gettysburg, 156 years ago today.
In the Gettysburg Address, President
Lincoln expressed some of the most im-
portant American values in just 272
words. At the time, President Lincoln
said: ‘‘The world will little note, nor
long remember what we say here, but
it can never forget what they did
here.’’
Over the past 150 years, the world
still remembers the service of those
who fought in Gettysburg, including
my great-grandfather.
We continue to remember and to
cherish what President Lincoln said
there, and we remain resolved ‘‘that
government of the people, by the peo-
ple, for the people, shall not perish
from the Earth.’’
It is my privilege to represent Get-
tysburg, Pennsylvania, in the United
States House of Representatives and to
highlight our region’s significant role
in American history.

FOOD BANKS PLAY AN IMPOR-
TANT ROLE IN SUPPORTING
FAMILIES WHO NEED A HELPING
HAND
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, this weekend I had the
pleasure of joining volunteers of my
district at the Port Matilda Baptist
Church for the monthly CommonFood
distribution event.
CommonFood is an organization that
works to provide underserved and un-
deremployed elderly, single-parent
families, and low-income families in
western Centre County with nutritious
food.
CommonFood feeds approximately
140 to 150 families in the area. Each
month these families receive a box of
food valued at approximately $150 filled
with meat, produce, and nonperish-
ables.
Organizations like CommonFood and
our Nation’s food banks play an impor-
tant role in supporting families who
may need a helping hand. Through the
USDA’s Emergency Food Assistance
Program, States are provided with food
that is then distributed to local food
banks and soup kitchens. These organi-
zations then distribute quality ingredi-
ents to low-income households who are,
in turn, able to provide their families
with nutritious meals.
Organizations that provide emer-
gency food assistance play an impor-
tant role in the lives of low-income
families, and they deserve our support.
I am proud to support the farm bill
that provides that type of support.

CONGRATULATING LOYALSOCK
LANCERS MARCHING BAND
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, on behalf
of the people of Pennsylvania’s 12th
Congressional District, I congratulate
the Loyalsock Lancers Marching Band
on their recent State championship at
the 2019 Cavalcade of Bands.
The Lancers 2019 show entitled,
‘‘Heart of the Machine,’’ Tin Man’s
journey to finding his heart, has been
noted as leaving fans on their feet
cheering during halftime events at
football games and during their com-
petition season.
The Loyalsock Lancers Marching
Band has a rich history of success, win-
ning the 2017 Cavalcade of Bands, being
20-time Tournament of Bands Region 4
champions, and marching in the Na-
tional Outback Bowl parade. The band
is the only band in North America to
open for the performing group
DRUMLine Live.
Even given this rich history of
achievement, band director Ryan
Bulgarelli said that the 2019 Lancers
are possibly the best in school history.
Again, I congratulate the Loyalsock
Lancers Marching Band on their recent
State championship.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8968 November 19, 2019
reported a rule, House Resolution 708,
providing for consideration of the Sen-
ate amendment to H.R. 3055. One hour
of general debate has been provided,
controlled by the chair and ranking
minority member of the Committee on
Appropriations.
Mr. Speaker, funding the government
may seem like an arcane exercise to
some watching this debate today, but
it is the most basic responsibility any
Member of Congress has. And failure to
follow through could be devastating.
Remember what happened during the
Trump shutdown? The President and
Republican leaders who controlled the
Congress then caused the longest gov-
ernment shutdown in American his-
tory.
Hundreds of Federal workers were
forced to miss paychecks. The men and
women who keep our country safe
struggled to put food on the table.
Members of the Coast Guard, FBI
agents, Border Patrol officers, and TSA
agents waited in long lines at food
banks to provide for their families.
Millions of households were at risk of
experiencing a gap in their SNAP bene-
fits without a backup plan. And I could
go on and on.
These debates are not just some ab-
stract political exercise. They have
real-life consequences. And that is why
this majority passed bills to fund
roughly 96 percent of the Federal Gov-
ernment earlier this year, but Leader
MCCONNELL and Senate Republicans
couldn’t get their work done.
So today we find ourselves needing to
take action, once again, before funding
runs out later this week. And, once
again, this majority is not shirking its
responsibilities. We are taking the lead
through a bill that not only keeps the
lights on, it addresses the most critical
budget priorities we face.
In addition to funding the govern-
ment through December 20, the under-
lying measure also gives our military a
3.1 percent pay raise. It fully funds a
fair and accurate 2020 Census, and it
keeps critical public health programs
going for another month, so consumers
don’t see a gap in care. Families, busi-
nesses, and communities need this cer-
tainty while talks continue on a
longer-term deal.
Just as important as what is here,
Mr. Speaker, is what is not here. There
are no controversial policy provisions,
nothing designed to make Members run
to their partisan corners. This is sim-
ply about whether key programs re-
main authorized and funded, whether
members of our military are able to
avoid the pain of budget uncertainty,
and whether we guarantee an accurate
2020 Census.
You know, we fight about a lot of
issues on this floor, but this bill should
not be one of them. I know President
Trump’s disposition is to govern by
tweet. That is what helped bring on the
last Republican shutdown. I don’t
know if he has logged on in the last few
minutes and tried to throw a wrench
into the process, but I hope that re-
gardless of what he does or doesn’t say
in the next few days, Republicans will
join us in agreeing that we should not
be shutting the government down.
We should pass this bill. We should
allow appropriators to have more time
to negotiate and continue this process
in an orderly way. Make no mistake,
this majority will continue fighting
hard for our priorities. We are going to
keep defending vital programs, and we
will be providing a check on the Trump
administration. But we are going to
fight for what we believe in while
averting another costly shutdown be-
cause it is the right thing to do, and it
is the responsible thing to do.
I don’t expect that my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle are always
going to share our priorities, but I do
know that there are many in the
House, and I include my ranking mem-
ber who was also an appropriator in
that category, who is sincerely dedi-
cated to making sure we do our job to
making sure we fund our government,
to making sure that we achieve a rea-
sonable compromise, and to making
sure that we avoid another shutdown
that has such catastrophic effects.
So I urge all my colleagues to join
with us. Let’s allow more time for
talks to continue while saying enough
to government shutdowns.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank my good friend, the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Chairman MCGOV-
ERN) for yielding me the customary 30
minutes, and I yield myself such time
as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, we are here on a bill
that represents one of the most funda-
mental roles of the United States Con-
gress, and that is to fund the govern-
ment, and to keep it open.
This continuing resolution ensures
critical government funding will re-
main in place through December 20.
While short-term measures are never
ideal, this extension of funding is nec-
essary to ensure that the House and
the Senate can continue to negotiate
and reach agreement on a full-year ap-
propriation for fiscal year 2020.
As Members of Congress, we are obli-
gated each year to pass legislation that
funds the government and keeps it
open so that it can continue to provide
services that many of our constituents
are counting on. With today’s bill, we
ensure that the government remains
open until December 20, which will give
Congress time to reach an agreement
funding the entire government for the
rest of the fiscal year.
This continuing resolution not only
maintains government funding, but it
also rightly extends authorizations for
some key programs that otherwise
would expire, programs like commu-
nity health centers, a special diabetes
program, and the special diabetes pro-
gram for Native Americans. And we are
also adding an adjustment to raise pay
for our members of the armed services
by 3.1 percent.
Even though it is good news that we
are preventing a government shutdown
with this continuing resolution—as my
friend knows, I certainly plan to sup-
port it when it comes to the floor—to-
day’s measure sadly represents a
missed opportunity for the House of
Representatives. The fact that we are
here today on our second continuing
resolution of this fiscal year is a re-
minder that Congress is not getting its
work done, at least when it comes to
appropriations.
Last year, despite the fact that we
were in the midst of an election cycle,
Congress still managed to get appro-
priations bills covering 80 percent of
full-year spending passed into law by
the start of the fiscal year. Today, by
contrast, we have passed exactly zero
appropriations bills into law, despite
being almost 2 months into the fiscal
year.
This state of affairs is disappointing,
and while I recognize that this is cer-
tainly not entirely the fault of the
House of Representatives, we still have
yet to pass all 12 bills out of our own
House. The job won’t get any closer to
completion until we pass all 12 appro-
priations bills for this fiscal year. The
American people deserve no less from
us and our full attention on this press-
ing matter.
Again, I share my friend’s frustration
at this process, but I am actually
somewhat optimistic that in the next
30 days we can get that job done and
get out of this cycle of continuing reso-
lutions and actually have a fully func-
tional government with 12 appropria-
tions bills. Certainly, I intend to work
to achieve that aim. I know my friend
and my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle on the Appropriations Committee
will do that, and I sincerely hope we
can be successful.
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the
rule, but support for the underlying
bill, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we
don’t have any additional speakers on
our side, so we are ready to close any
time the gentleman is.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
I urge opposition to the rule. And
while I am encouraged that we are con-
sidering a continuing resolution to
keep the government open and oper-
ating until December 20, our work for
this fiscal year is not done. It is not
going to be done until we pass all 12 ap-
propriations bills into law.
While the House is focused on other
areas, we have neglected some of our
key responsibilities in both Chambers,
quite frankly, for funding the govern-
ment for fiscal year 2020. Our constitu-
ents demand that we get our job done.
So, Mr. Speaker, again, I reiterate
my commitment. I know the commit-
ment of my colleagues on the Appro-
priations Committee, on both sides of
the aisle, to work diligently to come to
an agreement so we can we can bring
before this body compromised legisla-
tion between a Republican Senate and

a Democratic House, legislation that
we can all, frankly, send to the Presi-
dent with a great deal of pride. This
underlying legislation gives us the
time to do that.
I thank my friend for cooperating,
and I look forward to working with
him on that measure, as well as the
eventual completion of the appropria-
tions process.
So, Mr. Speaker, while I oppose the
rule, I support the underlying bill, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
b 1230
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Let me begin my closing by again
thanking the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE) not only for his work
on the Rules Committee but also for
his work on the Appropriations Com-
mittee. I think he understands the im-
portance of making sure that we don’t
have any more government shutdowns,
but he also understands that in this
place, no matter who is in charge, you
don’t always get 100 percent of what
you want and that sometimes com-
promise is appropriate and necessary
to do the right thing.
Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman
knows, we on this side tried to accom-
modate the minority in terms of the
underlying measure, changing the un-
derlying measure at the minority’s re-
quest. Unfortunately, a Member on the
minority side objected, so we were not
able to do that, but I do have nothing
but the highest respect for the gen-
tleman, and I appreciate his words.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I know that some
of my friends on the other side of the
aisle would have drafted a different bill
if they were in charge. I want my col-
leagues to know that if I could wave a
magic wand and have my own way in
everything, I would, too.
For example, I would have removed
the 4-month extension of the PATRIOT
Act’s FISA provision from this bill. I
have voted against this program in the
past and for bipartisan reforms that
would strip the government of this un-
checked and, I believe, unconstitu-
tional spying power.
I may be the chairman of the Rules
Committee, but I don’t believe it
should be my way or the highway on
everything. I don’t believe in blowing
up a bipartisan, bicameral negotiation
just because I didn’t get my own way
on a particular provision.
But make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, I
hope that we have a standalone and ro-
bust debate on the FISA when the ex-
tension expires next year. As I said,
this is a 4-month extension that we are
talking about. Meaningful reforms, I
think, are long overdue.
Let me remind my colleagues what is
at stake today. 800,000 Americans had
their paychecks held hostage for 35
days during the President’s last shut-
down. Workers couldn’t pay their bills.
Communities lost access to health and
safety services. Our national security
was endangered. Our economy was
harmed. The nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office estimates that it
cost us billions of dollars for the Presi-
dent’s shutdown.
The choice before us today is whether
we are going to vote to cause a repeat
of that devastation or not. I think the
costs are too high, and I would like to
think my Republican friends have
learned their lesson.
Look, no one expects either side to
stop fighting for what they believe in,
but let’s do it while the lights are on.
There is really nothing terribly con-
troversial here. This is not a radical
proposal. It is about keeping the gov-
ernment funded through December 20,
giving the men and women of our mili-
tary a raise, fully funding the Census,
and encouraging Senator MCCONNELL
and Senate Republicans to finally get
their work done.
House appropriators, I would say in a
bipartisan way, did most of their work.
The Senate remains a problem on get-
ting a yearlong budget deal.
Quite frankly, if it were possible, the
Senate majority leader should be sued
for malpractice due to his inaction.
But we are where we are, and we should
all be able to agree on that. Mr. Speak-
er, I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this
rule and on the underlying bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time, and I move the previous
question on the resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO
BURUNDI—MESSAGE FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–81)
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message
from the President of the United
States; which was read and, together
with the accompanying papers, referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
and ordered to be printed:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the
situation in Burundi declared in Execu-
tive Order 13712 of November 22, 2015, is
to continue in effect beyond November
22, 2019.
The situation in Burundi, which has
been marked by killing and other vio-
lence against civilians, unrest, the in-
citement of violence, and significant
political repression, and which threat-
ens the peace, security, and stability of
Burundi and the region, continues to
pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. There-
fore, I have determined that it is nec-
essary to continue the national emer-
gency declared in Executive Order 13712
with respect to the situation in Bu-
rundi.

based assistance budget authority.

specified in subsection (d)(2)(A), any lien on the

nancing obtained by the owner shall be subordi-
nate to any FHA-insured mortgage lien trans-

quirements of subsection (d)(2), the owner or
mortgagor of the receiving project or projects
shall execute and record either a continuation

SEC. 212. Notwithstanding any other provision
of law, in fiscal year 2020, in managing and dis-
posing of any multifamily property that is

the Secretary shall maintain any rental assist-
ance payments under section 8 of the United
States Housing Act of 1937 and other programs

mines, in consultation with the tenants and the
local government, that such a multifamily prop-
erty owned or held by the Secretary is not fea-
sible for continued rental assistance payments

tating and operating the property and all avail-
able Federal, State, and local resources, includ-

fordability Act of 1997 (‘‘MAHRAA’’) (42 U.S.C.

shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that
project-based contracts remain in effect prior to
foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contrac-
tual abatement remedies to assist relocation of

consent of the affected tenants and use of other
available remedies, such as partial abatements

family property described under this section, the
contract and allowable rent levels on such prop-
erties shall be subject to the requirements under
section 524 of MAHRAA.
SEC. 213. Public housing agencies that own
and operate 400 or fewer public housing units
may elect to be exempt from any asset manage-

retary shall not impose any requirement or
guideline relating to asset management that re-
stricts or limits in any way the use of capital
funds for central office costs pursuant to section
9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2) of the United States Housing
Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)): Provided,
That a public housing agency may not use cap-
ital funds authorized under section 9(d) for ac-
tivities that are eligible under section 9(e) for as-
sistance with amounts from the operating fund
in excess of the amounts permitted under section
9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2).
SEC. 215. No official or employee of the De-
partment of Housing and Urban Development
shall be designated as an allotment holder un-
less the Office of the Chief Financial Officer has
determined that such allotment holder has im-
plemented an adequate system of funds control
and has received training in funds control pro-
cedures and directives. The Chief Financial Of-
ficer shall ensure that there is a trained allot-
ment holder for each HUD appropriation under
the accounts ‘‘Executive Offices’’, ‘‘Administra-
tive Support Offices’’, ‘‘Program Offices’’, ‘‘Gov-
ernment National Mortgage Association—Guar-
antees of Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan
Guarantee Program Account’’, and ‘‘Office of
Inspector General’’ within the Department of
Housing and Urban Development.
SEC. 216. The Secretary of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development shall, for fis-
cal year 2020, notify the public through the Fed-
eral Register and other means, as determined
appropriate, of the issuance of a notice of the
availability of assistance or notice of funding
availability (NOFA) for any program or discre-
tionary fund administered by the Secretary that
is to be competitively awarded. Notwithstanding

the Secretary may make the NOFA available
only on the Internet at the appropriate Govern-
ment web site or through other electronic media,
as determined by the Secretary.
SEC. 217. Payment of attorney fees in pro-
gram-related litigation shall be paid from the in-
dividual program office and Office of General
Counsel salaries and expenses appropriations.
The annual budget submission for the program
offices and the Office of General Counsel shall

fer up to 10 percent or $5,000,000, whichever is

any such office or account shall be increased or
decreased by more than 10 percent or $5,000,000,
whichever is less, without prior written ap-
proval of the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations: Provided further, That the Sec-
retary shall provide notification to such Com-
mittees 3 business days in advance of any such
transfers under this section up to 10 percent or
$5,000,000, whichever is less.

sistance payments shall maintain decent, safe,
and sanitary conditions, as determined by the
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
(in this section referred to as the ‘‘Secretary’’),
and comply with any standards under applica-
ble State or local laws, rules, ordinances, or reg-
ulations relating to the physical condition of

ance payment contract.

Standards (UPCS) score of 60 or less; or
(2) fails to certify in writing to the Secretary
within 3 days that all Exigent Health and Safe-
ty deficiencies identified by the inspector at the
project have been corrected.
Such requirements shall apply to insured and
noninsured projects with assistance attached to
the units under section 8 of the United States
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but do not
apply to such units assisted under section
8(o)(13) (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to public
housing units assisted with capital or operating
funds under section 9 of the United States Hous-
ing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g).
(c)(1) Within 15 days of the issuance of the
REAC inspection, the Secretary must provide
the owner with a Notice of Default with a speci-
fied timetable, determined by the Secretary, for
correcting all deficiencies. The Secretary must
also provide a copy of the Notice of Default to
the tenants, the local government, any mortga-
gees, and any contract administrator. If the
owner’s appeal results in a UPCS score of 60 or
above, the Secretary may withdraw the Notice
of Default.
(2) At the end of the time period for correcting

fault, if the owner fails to fully correct such de-
ficiencies, the Secretary may—
(A) require immediate replacement of project
management with a management agent ap-
proved by the Secretary;
(B) impose civil money penalties, which shall
be used solely for the purpose of supporting safe
and sanitary conditions at applicable properties,
as designated by the Secretary, with priority
given to the tenants of the property affected by
the penalty;
(C) abate the section 8 contract, including
partial abatement, as determined by the Sec-
retary, until all deficiencies have been corrected;

of the assistance contract as long as such re-
newal is offered;
(E) transfer the existing section 8 contract to
another project or projects and owner or own-
ers;
(F) pursue exclusionary sanctions, including
suspensions or debarments from Federal pro-
grams;
(G) seek judicial appointment of a receiver to
manage the property and cure all project defi-
ciencies or seek a judicial order of specific per-
formance requiring the owner to cure all project
deficiencies;
(H) work with the owner, lender, or other re-
lated party to stabilize the property in an at-
tempt to preserve the property through compli-
ance, transfer of ownership, or an infusion of
capital provided by a third-party that requires
time to effectuate; or
(I) take any other regulatory or contractual
remedies available as deemed necessary and ap-
propriate by the Secretary.
(d) The Secretary shall also take appropriate
steps to ensure that project-based contracts re-
main in effect, subject to the exercise of contrac-
tual abatement remedies to assist relocation of
tenants for major threats to health and safety
after written notice to the affected tenants. To
the extent the Secretary determines, in consulta-
tion with the tenants and the local government,
that the property is not feasible for continued
rental assistance payments under such section 8
or other programs, based on consideration of—
(1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating
the property and all available Federal, State,
and local resources, including rent adjustments
under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted
Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997
(‘‘MAHRAA’’); and
(2) environmental conditions that cannot be
remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Sec-
retary may contract for project-based rental as-
sistance payments with an owner or owners of
other existing housing properties, or provide
other rental assistance.
(e) The Secretary shall report quarterly on all
properties covered by this section that are as-
sessed through the Real Estate Assessment Cen-

less than 60 or have received an unsatisfactory
management and occupancy review within the
past 36 months. The report shall include—
(1) the enforcement actions being taken to ad-
dress such conditions, including imposition of
civil money penalties and termination of sub-
sidies, and identify properties that have such
conditions multiple times;
(2) actions that the Department of Housing
and Urban Development is taking to protect ten-
ants of such identified properties; and
(3) any administrative or legislative rec-
ommendations to further improve the living con-
ditions at properties covered under a housing
assistance payment contract.
This report shall be due to the Senate and
House Committees on Appropriations no later
than 30 days after the enactment of this Act,
and on the first business day of each Federal
fiscal year quarter thereafter while this section
remains in effect.

this Act, or any other Act, for purposes author-
ized under section 8 (only with respect to the
tenant-based rental assistance program) and
section 9 of the United States Housing Act of
1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.), may be used by any

designed to reduce evictions or expand access to

payment insurance.
SEC. 239. It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) more than 17,000,000 people live in manu-
factured homes and benefit from high-quality
affordable homes which provide stability;
(2) owners of manufactured homes have dis-
proportionately low-income households, and in
2013, the median annual household income for
living in manufactured housing was $28,400;
(3) approximately 75 percent of manufactured
home households earn less than $50,000 per
year;
(4) more than 10 percent of veterans in the
United States live in manufactured homes;
(5) in late 1990, manufactured housing rep-
resented 2⁄3 of the new affordable housing pro-
duced in the United States and remains a sig-
nificant source of unsubsidized affordable hous-
ing in the United States;
(6) in 2015, the average cost per square foot for
a new manufactured home was 48 dollars, less
than half of the cost per square foot for a new-
site built, structure-only home, which was $101;
(7) in 2009, 43 percent of all new homes that
sold for less than $150,000 were manufactured
homes;
(8) manufactured homes account for 23 per-
cent of new home sales under $200,000;
(9) more than 50,000 manufactured home com-
munities, also referred to as ‘‘mobile home
parks’’, exist throughout the United States;
(10) more than 2,900,000 manufactured homes
are placed in manufactured home communities;
(11) manufactured home communities provide
critical affordable housing, but receive very lit-
tle Federal, State, or local funds to subsidize the
cost of manufactured homes;
(12) manufactured home owners in such com-
munities may own the home, but they do not
own the land under the home, which leaves the
home owners vulnerable to rent increases, arbi-
trary rule enforcement, and in the case of a
manufactured home community owner con-
verting the land to some other use, community
closure;
(13) an eviction or closure of a manufactured
home community is very disruptive to a resident
who may be unable to pay the thousands of dol-
lars it takes to move the manufactured home or
find a new location for the manufactured home;
(14) in an effort to preserve a crucial source of
affordable housing within the past two decades,
a national network of housing providers has
helped residents purchase and own the land
under the manufactured home community, and
manage the manufactured home community;
(15) nationwide, there are more than 1,000 sta-
ble, permanent ownership cooperatives or non-
profit-owned developments in more than a dozen
States;
(16) members of manufactured home commu-
nities continue to own such homes individually,
own an equal share of the land beneath the en-
tire manufactured home community, participate
in the governing of the community, and elect a
board of directors who make major decisions
within the manufactured home community by a
democratic vote;
(17) in New Hampshire, more than 30 percent
of manufactured home communities are owned
by residents;
(18) resident-owned cooperatives and non-
profit owned communities have also flourished
in Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota;
(19) nationwide, only 2 percent of all manu-
factured home communities are resident or non-
profit-owned;
(20) when the owner of a manufactured home
community or his or her heirs sell the commu-
nity to the highest bidder, it can result in dis-
placement for dozens and sometimes hundreds of
families; and
(21) Congress should endeavor to protect resi-
dents of manufactured home communities by en-
couraging the owners of those properties to sell
them to nonprofit organizations or to the resi-
dents themselves to own cooperatively.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 708, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 1 hour
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on Appropriations.
The gentlewoman from New York
(Mrs. LOWEY) and the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will
control 30 minutes.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days within
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on the House amendment to the Senate
amendment to H.R. 3055.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
While the House did its work and
passed 12 appropriations bills through
committee and 10 appropriations bills
off the floor, delays in the Senate mean
the appropriations process is behind.
With just days until current stopgap
funding expires, we must pass a con-
tinuing resolution to keep the govern-
ment open and fund key priorities as
we negotiate subcommittee allocations
and then finalize individual appropria-
tion bills.
This legislation avoids controversial
policies and instead contains provi-
sions that reflect shared priorities, in-
cluding bipartisan language to fully
fund a fair and accurate 2020 decennial
Census, a 3.1 percent pay raise for our
military, and language to prevent a re-
scission of $7.6 billion in highway fund-
ing.
In addition to these provisions, the
CR includes a package of extenders
that will keep health programs critical
to American families up and running.
By extending these programs and gov-
ernment funding through December 20,
this CR will allow additional time to
negotiate and enact responsible long-
term funding for priorities that make
our country safer and stronger and give
working families a better chance at a
better life.
Mr. Speaker, even as we pass this CR
today, American families, businesses,
and communities need the certainty of
full-year funding. To complete the ap-
propriations process, we must first set-
tle allocations with the Senate Repub-
licans. Only by coming together in
good faith can we enact responsible
full-year spending bills that invest for
the people and give every American a
better chance at a better life.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
support of this legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9038 November 19, 2019
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
It is with a heavy heart that I rise
today in opposition to the continuing
resolution. As an appropriator, I don’t
want to support anything short of full-
year appropriations bills, especially
when it comes to funding for our na-
tional defense. Even so, in September, I
urged my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing for a temporary CR to avoid a gov-
ernment shutdown and give the Senate
time to complete their work.
At that time the budget deal had just
been signed into law, and the Senate
had not yet started consideration of
full appropriations measures for fiscal
year 2020. By voting for the last CR, I
argued at the time that we would pro-
vide enough time for appropriators in
the House and the Senate to complete
work on full-year appropriations bills.
Unfortunately, not only has that not
happened, there still has not even been
an agreement reached on spending lev-
els for those bills. No business in the
world could survive on temporary fund-
ing doled out on a month-to-month
basis. The uncertainty created by the
habit Congress finds itself in of re-
peated CRs and the continual threat of
a shutdown is crippling, especially for
our military.
Continuing resolutions limit the
military’s ability to operate, train, and
care for our servicemembers and their
families and continue the critical re-
search and development that is needed
to meet and defeat all threats. Con-
gress must not fail to meet its most
fundamental constitutional responsi-
bility to provide appropriations.
I call on my colleagues in both par-
ties in both Chambers of Congress to
immediately come together, put poli-
tics aside, and work together to reach
an agreement for a full-year appropria-
tions measure that the President can
sign.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
the balance of my time to the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) and I
ask unanimous consent that she be al-
lowed to control that time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
MORELLE). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentlewoman from New
York?
There was no objection.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), our majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
I want to thank Mrs. LOWEY and Ms.
GRANGER for their leadership on this
committee. I want them to know that
I appreciate their commitment to
doing the appropriations process the
way we are supposed to do it.
But this day is a recognition of fail-
ure, a failure to do our work as those
who adopted the Budget Committee re-
port in 1974, as those of us who have
served on the Appropriations Com-
mittee since 1983, 23 years active on the
Appropriations Committee, but still on
it but under a waiver.
This is an admission of failure. It is
a recognition of failure. It is a recogni-
tion that the Senate did not do its job.
It is a recognition that the White
House would not cooperate in getting
to 302(b) allocations.
I talked to Senator MCCONNELL in
January of this year. Leader MCCON-
NELL and I agreed that we wanted to
get the appropriations work done in a
fashion that it was intended to be done,
considering discretely and individually
appropriation bills, considering them
on the floor.
Now, frankly, we did not do that. We
did not do it for time’s sake, so that we
could do things in a timely fashion.
And we considered three omnibus bills,
minibuses as we called them, and we
sent them to the Senate prior to June
26 of this year, which gave the Senate
more time. They had all the time they
needed. And because the White House,
and, in particular, the acting chief of
staff, Mr. Mulvaney—who has been one
of the most negative people I have
dealt with in terms of fiscal responsi-
bility and doing the work of the House
on time, and the person who would say
‘‘amen’’ would be John Boehner. Paul
Ryan would be not too far behind.
But Mr. Mulvaney wanted to go to
sequester. That was his original play.
And when that didn’t fly some months
into the sequester gambit, he went to a
CR for the whole year.
b 1415
But then he found the Pentagon
rightfully was very concerned about
that proposal that would damage our
national security, so he continued to
delay. I don’t know whether the Presi-
dent was involved in it or not, frankly.
So we did not get to a 302(a) allocation.
For those, Mr. Speaker, watching all
this jargon that we are using, that
means how much discretionary money
we are going to spend in total. By the
way, our citizens, Mr. Speaker, ought
to know that it is only about one-third,
maybe a little less, that is discre-
tionary. The other is Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid, things of that na-
ture.
We needed to come to an agreement
on how much we were going to spend.
After all, we understand the President
has to sign the bills. But it was not the
committees that made that agreement.
It was not the Budget Committee that
was involved in that agreement. It was
Speaker PELOSI and Secretary Mnuchin
meeting together. The Senate wasn’t
really involved.
We got to a number, and that was
good, in July, which meant that the
Senate had another 2 months to pass
its bills, to come to an agreement.
They didn’t have to take our 302(b),
and they weren’t going to take it. They
would have taken it within the con-
straints of the Mnuchin-Pelosi agree-
ment or, more properly, the Pelosi-
Mnuchin agreement. But they still did
not enact a single appropriations bill.
Now, the floor is not filled. The gal-
leries are not filled, Mr. Speaker. This
is sort of inside baseball. But, very
frankly, there are only 12 bills that
need to pass. All the other bills can be
put off. It will have adverse effects, but
it will not shut down the people’s gov-
ernment. But if we don’t pass these 12
bills, it shuts down the people’s govern-
ment.
For the first time in the history of
the Congress, this Congress took over
with a government partially shut
down.
I am going to vote for this CR, but I
do not delude myself that this is a suc-
cessful pursuance of the appropriations
process. It is not. It is a failure. It is
not our failure. We did our work on
time.
The Republican whip, Mr. Speaker,
keeps telling me: Well, it was a par-
tisan exercise.
It may well have been a partisan ex-
ercise, but 10 bills went to the United
States Senate unattended, untouched,
unconsidered, and so we are here.
The alternative is shutting down gov-
ernment at midnight on December 21.
That is not an acceptable alternative.
I want to tell my friends, Mr. Speak-
er, and I want to say to those in this
Chamber, that I have great respect for
Ranking Member GRANGER, with whom
I have worked for longer perhaps than
either one of us want to say, but a long
time. I have respect for her commit-
ment to the appropriations process, her
commitment to regular order, and her
commitment to doing our work in the
fashion that the American people can
have confidence.
Mr. Speaker, I have confidence in
Mrs. LOWEY, the chair of the com-
mittee. I know that they are working
together and have the same objective.
That does not mean they agree on
every dollar, as to how it ought to be
allocated, but it does mean they think
it ought to be considered in the way
that it should be. This is not the way it
should be.
This is the way it is, and I am going
to vote for it. I urge my Members to
vote for it. But I will say, Mr. Speaker,
if I am upset today, if we don’t get our
work done, and I mean done, and you
talk about a CR on December 20, I will
not be happy. I don’t know what that
means, but I am going to have addi-
tional discussions with Senator
MCCONNELL, as I have had with the
chairman of the Appropriations Com-
mittee in the Senate and the ranking
member, Mr. LEAHY. I have talked to
both Mr. SHELBY and Mr. LEAHY. They
want to get this work done.
There is no reason on God’s green
Earth that we cannot do the appropria-
tions bills in the way that they ought
to be done, except we lack the will to
compromise. We lack the will to work
together. We lack the will to do the
American people’s business on time, ra-
tionally, and without creating a sense
that this institution cannot and does
not work.
I hope we use these days that are left
between today and December 20 in a

productive, effective way so that the
appropriations process can be con-
cluded on December 20 or before.
This probably is going to have no
constructive effect this day, but I hope
in the days to come that we will all
have such a sense of urgency that we
owe it to the country, to our people,
and to this institution to show the
American people we can make it work.
Let’s do it.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. WOMACK).
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
GRANGER) for yielding and for her lead-
ership.
I, too, am concerned about the direc-
tion we are heading in this continuing
resolution, but I have another reason,
Mr. Speaker. This CR includes a provi-
sion that has a significant budgetary
impact. I am frustrated that the
amendment I filed with the Rules Com-
mittee last night was not made in
order to address it.
My amendment would have offset $76
billion in mandatory spending in-
creases from repealing a rescission of
funds in the 2015 Fixing America’s Sur-
face Transportation Act, or FAST Act,
a transportation bill.
This provision, Mr. Speaker, would
have a significant impact on manda-
tory spending, which everybody in this
Chamber knows is driving the Nation’s
deficits and debt.
Let me be clear: The amendment
would have allowed for the highway
funding to take place but simply called
for it to be paid for.
Now, I don’t think that is asking too
much, to ask for increases in spending,
given the fact that we will have a tril-
lion-dollar deficit this year on top of
the $23 trillion debt, to just simply pay
for the excesses.
The House should have had an oppor-
tunity to consider whether to offset
the funding in a fiscally responsible
manner, in my opinion. I find it trou-
bling that we were not given that op-
portunity. That is one thing.
The manner in which the CR was as-
sembled doesn’t provide a great deal of
hope that we will enact a full-year de-
fense spending bill, which the military
so desperately needs right now. I share
the concerns of the distinguished ma-
jority leader.
Mr. Speaker, I am not optimistic
that we will conclude all of these other
funding bills before the expiration of
the next CR. The difference is going to
be that it is going to be the 20th of De-
cember. It is going to be right before
Christmas, and we will do whatever we
can to get out of town to go celebrate
the holidays.
The majority leader says if that hap-
pens, he will be mad. My recommenda-
tion to him is to prepare to be mad. I
know how this place works.
Mr. Speaker, is it not apparent to the
discerning people of America and spe-
cifically to the people in this Chamber
that this is a flawed and broken proc-
ess and that we need to fix it?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas.
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, we need
to fix it.
I spent last year with the distin-
guished chair of the Appropriations
Committee, Mrs. LOWEY, as co-chairs of
the Joint Select Committee on Budget
and Appropriations Process Reform.
We got really close on some good ideas
that would fundamentally change the
way we do our Article I responsibility,
but we left all that at the altar.
What more evidence do we need to
show that this process is flawed, that it
is broken and needs to be fixed?
I am frustrated. The American people
are frustrated.
Nobody paying attention to this
process conducts their business or their
personal finances the way this body
does, the legislative body of the most
incredible country ever known to hu-
mankind.
Yet the question today is: Will we
just kick the can down the road to
right before Christmas in hopes that
this Congress is going to have some
epiphany that we have to do the work
that we have been trying to do for the
last 7 weeks? We are 7 weeks into the
fiscal year.
Mr. Speaker, I had breakfast this
morning with the Secretary of the
Army, and here is what he said: Even-
tually, we will give you the money, our
men and women in uniform. The prob-
lem is that we can’t give you the time
back.
That time is running through the
clock, so I am frustrated.
I am prepared to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I am
prepared to continue to work as long as
it takes to make sure that we do our
work on time and not kick the can
down the road.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this
continuing resolution.
I listened carefully to what the gen-
tleman said just prior to my taking the
floor, and I wish that the other body
had done its work. We did ours. I am
pretty proud of our Members.
This bill ensures that the Federal
Government and its lights stay on,
that we pay our bills on time, and that
the people’s business continues while
negotiations on a full year’s spending
deal proceed.
While we are hopeful an agreement
can quickly be reached, I am really dis-
appointed that the Senate continues to
delay while so much is at stake. I real-
ly don’t understand the problem over
there.
For each day that we delay in pass-
ing a full-year appropriations bill, we
send a message of uncertainty that has
consequences for the business of the
American people. Be glad you are not a
contracting officer in one of the agen-
cies, certainly the Department of De-
fense, at this point.
For our subcommittee, my bill, the
Energy and Water Development, and
Related Agencies appropriations bill,
proposes key investments to the Army
Corps of Engineers, in our Nation’s
crumbling water infrastructure, and in
the energy innovation pipeline that is
so essential to sustaining life on Earth.
The United States must remain at the
forefront of energy innovation to ad-
dress climate change, so vital to people
across the globe.
This bill essentially offers a pathway,
and that is all it is, for our committees
to negotiate on a final bill that makes
these key investments and many oth-
ers across committees.
In addition to giving Congress the
space to finalize our bills, this con-
tinuing resolution makes key invest-
ments in the Census, and they make
those investments as soon as the bill
passes.
We must ensure a complete census
count. In fact, the country can’t wait
even 1 month to invest in this ramp-up
effort. Ads are out all across the coun-
try. The Census Bureau has to do its
job.
b 1430
And the Census will support reappor-
tionment and will impact everything
the Federal Government does, from
grant programs to redistricting.
I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation so the committees can
move toward full agreement. I urge
prayerful thoughts for our colleagues
over in the other body to do their work
so that we don’t have to use up the full
time before December 20 and we can ac-
tually pass the bills that are necessary
before that time.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) of
the Military Construction, Veterans
Affairs, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, who does such a fine job.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the distinguished
woman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant sup-
port of this continuing resolution,
which would keep the government open
until December 20, 2019.
As has been stated, but can’t be stat-
ed enough, the House has done its job.
We passed our appropriations bills ear-
lier this summer. Unfortunately, the
Senate failed to act in time, and now
we are kicking the can down the road
yet again with a second CR.
A CR is destructive for our Federal
agencies, but we need to keep the gov-
ernment open, obviously. Fortunately,
this CR has a few provisions that make
this bitter medicine more palatable.
It once again includes critical health
extenders for Medicare and Medicaid
programs and for other benefit pro-
grams like Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families.

Notably, the bill also restores nec-
essary funding for the Census Bureau
as it gears up for the 2020 Census, and
it includes a 3.1 percent pay raise for
our troops. As chairwoman of the Ap-
propriations Military Construction,
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
Subcommittee, I happily support this
necessary pay raise for our service-
members.
But let me make this clear: We can-
not responsibly govern by an endless
series of destructive continuing resolu-
tions. These Band-Aids keep the lights
on but serve as de facto spending cuts
for our Federal agencies, and they
handcuff short and longer term budget
and project planning.
Instead of locking ourselves into a
series of CRs, it is imperative that the
Senate work with us in good faith to
come to agreement on top-line funding
numbers, and do so without taking all
their marching orders from the White
House.
Passing CRs also abdicates our con-
gressional power of the purse. The Ap-
propriations Committee put a lot of
work and countless beneficial provi-
sions into our bills. We must not toss
all of that thoughtful work aside.
Mr. Speaker, I support passage of
this CR. Our businesses, families, and
local communities deserve and need
that budget certainty.
But I urge Congress to work out
amongst ourselves a concrete path for-
ward to fulfill our appropriations re-
sponsibilities and resume orderly fund-
ing of the government.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to vote for this con-
tinuing resolution, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, the
Continuing Resolution before us today not
only keeps our government open and oper-
ating until December 20, 2019—as we finalize
the 2020 budget—but it also extends authori-
ties for critical services such as the National
Flood Insurance Program, Community Health
Centers, and the National Health Service
Corps.
Of particular significance to thousands of 9/
11 survivors—and a giant step forward for jus-
tice—the CR also reforms the US Victims of
State Sponsored Terrorism (USVSST) Fund to
ensure that immediate family members—the
spouses and children of the victims of 9/11—
are, for the first time, given rightful access to
the judgements they have won in court against
the perpetrators of the attack on our Nation.
The USVSST was established by Congress
in December 2015 to compensate victims of
international state-sponsored terrorism. It is
funded entirely by criminal and civil penalties
collected by the US government from foreign
entities that violate U.S. sanctions—primarily
related to Iran. In addition to compensating
Americans who were held hostage during the
Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979–1981, the 2015
legislation also sought to award any persons
who have won legal judgments in a U.S. fed-
eral district court against a state sponsor of
terrorism arising from acts of international ter-
rorism.
Is there any more deserving group of vic-
tims of state sponsored acts of terrorism than
those who lost their parents or spouses on
September 11, 2001? I don’t think so.
Yet, remarkably through a misinterpretation
of the 2015 law by the fund’s Special Master,
the immediate family members—i.e. the de-
pendents—were barred from participating—
that’s unfair, unjust and unconscionable.
In 2017 and 2019, the fund granted awards
to the Iranian hostages, their relatives, victims
of U.S. embassy bombings and the Marine
barracks in Lebanon—and to more distant rel-
atives of those who were killed on 9/11. But
the spouses and children of 9/11 victims were
denied, barred and shown the door.
With the deadline for the 2020 round of
awards approaching, this past September I
hosted a town meeting in Wall Township, New
Jersey. Widely attended by spouses and chil-
dren from across the entire tri-state area, the
meeting exposed anew the struggles these
survivors continue to face, the sacrifices they
have endured, the efforts they have made to
hold state sponsors of terrorism accountable
for the deaths of their loved ones, and the
madness in the decision to bar them from the
USVSST.
The technical correction in the CR reflects a
bipartisan agreement, an equitable fix to the
USVSST that permits 9/11 spouses and chil-
dren to pursue their judgements in the fund
while continuing the participation of other vic-
tims as well.
None of this would have been possible if not
for the leadership and commitment of the vic-
tim’s spouses and children, people who con-
tinue to seek justice after the murders of their
loved ones. Many stepped forward, and those
known as the Jersey Girls—Kristen
Breitweiser, Mindy Kleinberg, Lorie Van
Auken, and Kathy Maher—have been tireless,
factual and well-informed in advocating for the
needed reforms.
Kathy Wisneiwski, a surviving widow, former
school vice principal, and member of my staff,
has been relentless especially in working on
behalf of the surviving children. And Angela
Mistrulli was tenacious in working with leaders
outside the tri-state area to help bring about
this needed reform.
With absolute clarity, Congress has now in-
structed the Justice Department to specifically
honor the judgements of these immediate 9/11
family members.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 708,
the previous question is ordered.
The question is on the motion by the
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.
LOWEY).

RECOGNIZING ALZHEIMER’S
AWARENESS MONTH
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize November as Alz-
heimer’s Awareness Month.
Alzheimer’s disease causes brain cells
to waste away slowly and die, causing
memory loss and, possibly, death. It is
a condition that affects 5.5 million
Americans and growing.
It was believed to be a disease of old
age, but diet, exercise, and lifestyle are
becoming larger factors.
It is a personal concern for me be-
cause I am a diabetic. I have a greater
chance of contracting it as I age.
But Alzheimer’s patients are not the
only ones who suffer. The disease takes
a terrible toll on loved ones as sufferers
demand constant care.
Madam Speaker, we need to devote
more resources to a disease that could
affect us all.
f
RECOGNIZING JOHN O. BROWN AS
TENNESSEE SECOND DISTRICT’S
VETERAN OF THE MONTH
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I
rise to recognize John O. Brown as the
Tennessee Second District’s November
2019 Veteran of the Month.
A Vietnam war veteran, Sergeant
Brown served in the U.S. Army for al-
most 13 years before medically retiring
in 1971.
John Brown was born on January 17,
1936, in the metropolis of Kettle Hol-
low, Tennessee. He graduated from
Horace Maynard High School in 1951,
joined the Army in 1958, and deployed
to Vietnam as part of the Ninth Infan-
try Division in 1966. During his 12
months in Vietnam, Brown rose to the
rank of sergeant first class before re-
turning stateside.
In 1969, Sergeant Brown received or-
ders to return to Vietnam. On June 20
of that year, he was wounded in action
and medically evacuated. The injury
resulted in the amputation of one of
his legs.
For his bravery and service through-
out his military career, Sergeant
Brown was awarded the Purple Heart,
the Silver Star, the Combat Infantry
Badge, the Bronze Star, and the Army
Commendation Medal.
Despite living with a service-related
disability, Sergeant Brown enthusiasti-
cally reentered civilian life. He earned
degrees from Tennessee State Regional
Vocational School and the Tennessee
Institute of Electronics. Upon his grad-
uation, he worked in sales for Sony and
then became JVC’s director of govern-
ment overseas sales. He retired after a
27-year career with JVC.
I am proud to recognize John O.
Brown as the Tennessee Second Dis-
trict’s November 2019 Veteran of the
Month.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9042 November 19, 2019
REPLACE NAFTA WITH USMCA
(Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam
Speaker, I rise to express my hope and
expectation that the Trump adminis-
tration and Congress will resolve the
few outstanding issues so that Con-
gress can take a strong bipartisan vote
to modernize NAFTA, our outdated
trade agreement with Canada and Mex-
ico, and replace it with USMCA, a bet-
ter agreement that will benefit Amer-
ica’s workers, farmers, businesses, and
families, while also fortifying our rela-
tionship with our two closest neigh-
bors.
As a member of the Ways and Means
Trade Subcommittee, I believe well-ne-
gotiated trade agreements can improve
our economy and our security, but I
also know poorly negotiated trade
pacts can hurt America’s workers and
make it harder to maintain broad-
based support for the concept of freer
and fairer trade.
USMCA fixes flaws in some NAFTA
chapters based on the lessons we have
learned since NAFTA was enacted in
1994. It also adds new chapters to re-
flect the reality that the world has un-
dergone major changes in the last 25
years.
I support the deliberative and pro-
ductive negotiations taking place be-
tween the administration and House
Democrats. I think both sides are
working in good faith with the shared
goal of getting the best possible agree-
ment over the finish line. Each side re-
alizes inaction is not an option because
NAFTA must be revised.
I also support bipartisan and bi-
cameral efforts by the Florida delega-
tion to protect our farmers who grow
seasonal produce from unfair competi-
tion.
When it comes to USMCA, it is im-
portant we move swiftly and with a
sense of urgency, but it is just as im-
portant that we get this right.
f
SUPPORT TRICARE FAIRNESS FOR
NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE
RETIREES
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
to highlight H.R. 5169, the TRICARE
Fairness for National Guard and Re-
serve Retirees Act that I introduced
with Representative GABBARD earlier
today.
This bipartisan bill aligns the eligi-
bility age for TRICARE Standard,
Extra, and Prime, which are the
healthcare programs for uniformed
servicemembers, retirees, and their
families, with the age at which Na-
tional Guard and Reserve personnel
begin receiving their retired pay.
We have heavily relied upon our Na-
tional Guard and Reserve personnel for
the past 20 years, and they have made
major contributions to our force struc-
ture for over 200 years.
Congress previously recognized their
sacrifices by lowering the age that
they can receive their retired pay
based on their Active Duty service, but
it is not fair that their eligibility for
traditional TRICARE was left at age
60. This has resulted in early retirees
often spending the vast majority, if not
all, of their pension on TRICARE pre-
miums until they reach 60.
This bill will help these servicemem-
bers transition into retirement as in-
tended when Congress reduced their re-
tirement age. I urge my colleagues to
support this important legislation.
f
FINALIZE USMCA
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker,
Canada and Mexico are two of the Com-
monwealth’s largest trading partners.
In 2018 alone, Virginia exported $4.3 bil-
lion worth of goods to our northern and
southern neighbors.
Last month, in Chesterfield County, I
sat down with local businesses, busi-
ness leaders, and members of the
Chamber of Commerce to talk about
how the USMCA could strengthen ex-
port opportunities and spur economic
growth for businesses in our area.
Cattlemen and dairies, farmers, and
producers across my central Virginia
district care deeply about the certainty
and stability afforded by a trade deal.
Amid ongoing USMCA discussions, my
constituents want and need the long-
term certainty of a trade deal between
our three countries.
I thank the congressional working
group for its productive efforts to ar-
rive at a deal that meets the needs of
our farmers, producers, small busi-
nesses, medium-sized businesses, and
American workers.
We need House negotiators and the
administration to come to a final
agreement. We need to get this done
and deliver trade stability for our con-
stituents back home in my central Vir-
ginia district and across the country.
f
PASS USMCA WITHOUT DELAY
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, my
colleague from Virginia, on the other
side of the aisle, just gave my speech.
The USMCA is a very important doc-
ument, a very important measure, that
we need to pass without delay. Our
trade with Mexico and Canada, our two
most important trade partners in the
world, needs to be secure so that we
can start doing more business with
them.
It will be great for much in agri-
culture, our dairies, forestry, auto
parts, and California wine to have the
stability of this. It will also show the
rest of the world that we are ready to
do business and negotiate better deals
with Japan, China, and others.
Let’s get this done. Let’s not have
the USMCA vote held up any longer or
have it become leverage for other
things.
I ask Speaker PELOSI to please bring
this to the floor because I think we can
get many votes on both sides of the
aisle and pass this right away.
f
b 1530
LET’S GET THE USMCA DONE
(Mr. MCADAMS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, for
weeks we have heard that action on the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement is
eminently doable. So why haven’t we
gotten it done?
It is time to put politics aside and to
come together for the future of our
countries and our people.
NAFTA went into effect in 1994. It
was due for modernization. By all rea-
sonable accounts, USMCA represents
progress for farms and ranchers, for
autoworkers, for medical device manu-
facturers, and others.
This is a multitrillion-dollar eco-
nomic relationship between the United
States and our two neighbors. It sup-
ports millions of American jobs. In
Utah alone, trade with Mexico and
Canada supports over 120,000 jobs, jobs
that pay the rent, that provide
healthcare, that send kids to college
and help Utahns save for retirement.
Over $418 million worth of agricultural
exports are sent from Utah to our
North American neighbors each year.
We were elected to move forward on
priorities that matter to people’s ev-
eryday lives. There is nothing more
fundamental for businesses, employees,
and communities than to have sta-
bility on the economic front.
Today, I am saying no more foot-
dragging; no more vague promises
about ‘‘soon.’’ It is time to deliver on
what we promised. Come to an agree-
ment. Bring USMCA to the House
floor, and let’s get it done.
f
TRANSGENDER REMEMBRANCE
DAY
(Mr. CISNEROS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in anticipation of
Transgender Remembrance Day, to
honor the memory of those who have
been lost to anti-transgender violence.
It is important that we recognize the
bravery of those individuals who have
chosen to live truthfully and openly
and embrace their gender identity with
the world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9043
November 19, 2019
We must raise up their names and re-
member those who have been lost to
senseless violence and hate. We must
shine a light on the injustice that has
affected this community.
I am proud to have a transgender
woman as part of my staff.
I would also like to recognize the
Shah family from my district. Priya
and Jaspret Shah are the parents of a
brave little transgender girl. Together,
they have advocated not only for their
daughter, but for the entire
transgender community. Priya has
come to the forefront of the Human
Rights Campaign’s national program to
make schools safe spaces for
transgender children.
We must continue to stand in soli-
darity with the Shah family, their
daughter, and the entire transgender
community and continue to work to-
ward equality and justice for all.
f
SECURE OUR NATION’S ECONOMY
(Mr. STANTON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of the ongoing ef-
forts to secure our Nation’s economy.
In Arizona, that means giving job cre-
ators, large and small, access to mar-
kets in Mexico and Canada.
Sadly, Arizona’s recent trade history
was shaped by State leaders who dam-
aged our relationship with Mexico with
divisive, self-defeating rhetoric and
policies, such as SB 1070. That hurt our
economy and cost us jobs.
So, as Phoenix mayor, I worked over-
time to rebuild those relationships,
leading 18 trade missions to Mexico and
Canada. Our business community
helped me make the case for increasing
trade, and we saw results.
Since 2012, while the Nation’s exports
grew 0.1 percent, Phoenix’s exports
grew 20 percent. In 2017, trade with
Mexico and Canada produced nearly $10
billion in exports statewide.
Simply put, trade with our North
American allies is essential to Arizo-
na’s economy. Now we have a real op-
portunity to improve these relation-
ships through the USMCA. A new trade
agreement, with improved labor stand-

(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given

Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
the NAACP has been at the forefront in
the fight for equal educational, social,
economic, and legal rights for African
American communities.
The Mainland-Pleasantville NAACP
branch, led by President Olivia
Caldwell, has continuously fought for
those things, and they recently held
their annual Freedom Fund Awards
Luncheon. The luncheon honored the
people who fought alongside the
NAACP and their efforts for equal
rights.
President of Atlantic Cape Commu-
nity College, Dr. Barbara Gaba, re-
ceived the education award for fur-
thering educational fulfillment in the
African American community.
I would like to thank Dr. Gaba,
President Caldwell, and the NAACP for
their resilience in the fight for equal-
ity that not only impacts the people of
south Jersey, but all Americans every-
where. We all have the same blood
flowing through our veins.
May God bless them.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF SENATOR JOHNNY ISAKSON
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-

gia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
minority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the topic of this Spe-
cial Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I have a lot to say.
My colleague, Mr. HICE, has a lot to do.
I am going to yield to Mr. HICE so that
he can speak briefly and go back to his
committee.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank my good friend for yielding
a quick moment.
There are few people in Washington,
D.C., and in America who have had the
impact of Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON.
And when we think of Senator ISAKSON,
no question, there are so many things
that come to our mind.
Senator, you are and you have been
an incredible statesman, a phenomenal
leader, in Georgia, here in the United
States Senate, and in our country, and
we just want to say thank you for all
that you have done for us.
I think, personally, when I first came
to Congress, you were one of the first
individuals to reach out to me and to
give advice and encouragement. And to
this day, every time I see you, you do
that, and you will never know how
much that means.
I just want to publicly state that
JOHNNY ISAKSON, Senator ISAKSON, is a
hero for people all across this country.
Your brilliant mind and your leader-
ship will always be here, and we say
thank you from the bottom of our
heart. May God bless you and your
family as you go into this next chap-
ter.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, today, my colleagues
and I rise to honor the legislative leg-
acy and the life of my good friend and
colleague and fellow Georgia Bulldog,
U.S. Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON.
For more than 20 years, Senator
ISAKSON has served the people of Geor-
gia in the United States Congress, tire-
lessly fighting for the people of Geor-
gia.
During his tenure, Senator ISAKSON
has been a bellwether for many in our
delegation, both as a Member of this
body and as a United States Senator. If
I have heard it once, I have heard it a
thousand times: Where’s JOHNNY on
this? What does JOHNNY think about
this? Have you spoken to JOHNNY on
this?
He has offered counsel that has been
learned through his 40 years of public
service that is invaluable to me and
many of us in the Georgia delegation
and throughout this Nation.
I have many personal stories about
JOHNNY, some of them appropriate for
the floor, some of them not. But my
first recollection of Senator ISAKSON
was a call that I made as a young teen-
ager when we had a mutual friend and
I needed a little help getting him
through the ballot process at the fra-
ternity house. Senator ISAKSON picked
up the phone and called and, a few min-
utes later, the president of the frater-
nity walked in and said: I am not quite
sure who spoke to Senator ISAKSON, but
this is the way the next vote’s going to
go.
And that was all it took.
I can’t tell you, over the last 20, or,
I am sorry, I should say 30-plus years,
how much you have meant to me and
my family. And when I am back home,
I constantly tell the people the respect
our delegation and all the Members of
the House and the Senate have for you.
You have brought forward a sense of bi-
partisanship in working across the
aisle for the good of all Georgians.
He has played a key role in building
and maintaining his reputation, and I
look forward to that special tradition
continuing in the coming legislative
sessions.
Public service is much more than
just the service of the Member; it is
also the service of the family.
Senator ISAKSON, your children, your
wonderful wife, Dianne, we extend our
thanks for their commitment to serve
Georgia and their support of our dele-
gation and fellow delegation members.
Their impact cannot be understated,
and we look forward to you enjoying
more time with Dianne and your entire
family as you enter your next chapter.
For decades, Senator ISAKSON and his
family have faithfully served our
State. His character, godliness, and

statesmanship will be greatly missed in
Washington, D.C.
His faithful service to the great State
of Georgia is second only to our be-
loved mascot, Uga. He is a giant among
men and dogs, dedicated and delib-
erate, and it has been an honor to work
alongside him fighting for the good
people of Georgia and the veterans of
the United States of America.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS).
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I want
to thank my beloved colleague and my
friend for yielding. I would like to
thank our colleague, Mr. AUSTIN
SCOTT, for organizing this Special
Order tribute to a great man, to a won-
derful human being.
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize
Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON, a son of At-
lanta, Georgia. Senator ISAKSON is a
special man. He is a good man. I want
to thank him for his years of service in
the Georgia State Legislature, in the
United States House of Representa-
tives, and, now, in the United States
Senate.
On February 25, 1999, I introduced
JOHNNY as the newest member of the
Georgia congressional delegation to
the House of Representatives. He came
to Congress as a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Georgia and a successful
businessman.
Before coming to Congress, he served
as a member of the Georgia Air Na-
tional Guard, the State house minority
leader, a State senator, and the chair
of the State board of education.
On that day, I said he brought a
wealth of knowledge with him. I ex-
plained to our colleagues that, in his
decades of public service in our home
State, JOHNNY developed a great rep-
utation as a bridge builder, a man who
has strong beliefs but was also willing
to work with others to get things done.
Very quickly, Members of the House
and Senate discovered how true this
was. The Senator does not make a lot
of noise, but he has the ability and the
capacity to speak truth to power.
When JOHNNY served in the House of
Representatives, we always found a
way to come together, and we contin-
ued that tradition when he was elected
to the Senate. Over the years, we
worked together on many, many
issues, like transportation, water,
housing, and veterans affairs. We al-
ways found a way to get along and to
do the good work the people deserved.
Time and time again, he stood with
us, he worked with us to uplift African
Americans in the State of Georgia, to
recognize individuals like Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., and Jackie Robinson,
native of Georgia. He did not just talk
the talk, he literally walked the walk.
Senator, you not only supported the
reauthorization of the Voting Rights
Act in 2006, but, a few years later, you
even co-led the congressional pilgrim-
age to Selma, Alabama. I want to say
thank you for all of your good and
great work.
Those of us who know you will agree
that you are always thoughtful and
mindful, a warm and welcoming gen-
tleman in the truest sense of the word.
For two decades, you, Senator, led a
team that could cross the aisle without
compromising their values. Whenever a
constituent came over from a meeting
with you and your staff, they felt heard
and respected.
b 1545
I hope you do not mind, but I would
like to share a moment that stands out
for me and will always stand out for
me as long as I live, to this very day.
One morning, before I was scheduled
to read the 13th Amendment on the
House floor, Senator ISAKSON asked me
to come and speak with his staff about
service and my own experiences. We
had an honest and thoughtful discus-
sion. It was one of the most meaning-
ful, memorable experiences of my years
in Congress. I carry it in my heart to
this very day, to this very moment,
what Senator ISAKSON said. I believe 20
years have passed since I stood on this
very floor to introduce Senator ISAK-
SON to Congress.
As JOHNNY returns to private life
with his beloved wife, Dianne, of 51
years and his wonderful, beautiful chil-
dren and grandchildren, I would like to
thank JOHNNY for his years of service.
I would like to thank JOHNNY for his
service to our State, our Nation. I wish
JOHNNY health and happiness.
I hope the Senator takes some time
to enjoy a beautiful and wonderful life
in the State of Georgia. Senator ISAK-
SON has been very good to the people of
the State of Georgia, and I am lucky
enough, and just blessed really, to call
him a friend and a brother. I thank him
so much.
Madam Speaker, it is almost difficult
to yield back the time when I speak of
this good and great leader from the
State of Georgia. I thank JOHNNY for
his service. I will come over and meet
you, brother.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I wish all of America
could be here to see that, two icons
from Georgia embracing. What a won-
derful sight that I think is representa-
tive of the days of the past and the
days to come and how we should work
together. Thank you both so much, not
just for what you did, but for who you
are.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. GRAVES).
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank Representative SCOTT
for yielding and for coordinating this
hour of tribute to a dear, dear friend
and how humbling it is to follow my
good friend, Representative LEWIS, who
swore me in just the same, JOHNNY,
just over 9 years ago, right here in this
same spot.
I know this would certainly take
more than an hour, and I know this is
a Georgia delegation moment, but,
Senator, I am certain that if the House
would allow that, Member after Mem-
ber from State after State would come
down here and pay you tribute, just the
same as we are today.
As Members, we get up each and
every day and we work hard to make
sure our constituents have a great
place to live and provide for their fami-
lies. And it is not often that we have
the opportunity to share about the im-
pact that a single person might have
made on our very own lives.
Today is one of those rare occasions
for me, and I get to do that today
through the recognition of one of Geor-
gia’s giants. And I am going to do this
today, Senator, take the opportunity
to share of our first interaction, my
first introduction, my introduction to
Senator ISAKSON.
It was November 6, 1990, and I was
just your average 20-year-old college
student. I was apolitical. I was just
looking for a free meal that night. I
was an idealist, very open-minded, and
I was invited that night by my room-
mate to attend a political gathering.
And my roommate just happened to be
the son of Freddie Stevenson, who is a
dear friend of ours, Senator.
And that was my very first political
event ever that I had attended, and it
happened to be the gubernatorial elec-
tion night celebration, or that is at
least what I anticipated that night. I
can remember that evening as if it
were yesterday, and I know the Sen-
ator can, as well, as can so many oth-
ers.
As a north Georgia country boy, I
didn’t grow up in wealth or politics. I
just worked hard every day just trying
to get through each and every day.
But that night I was impacted. There
was a lot of energy. There was excite-
ment in the room. And that is infec-
tious, I know it is, but that is not what
it was about that night. I was impacted
more so than anything by a single per-
son, a person I didn’t even know yet, a
person that I would soon get to know
very well, though.
You might suggest that I was im-
pressed by the Senator’s resume, his
history and what he had done. I mean,
after all, we glossed over what the Sen-
ator has accomplished, but he has
served in the Georgia Air National
Guard. The Senator has 14 years in the
Georgia House as a minority leader.
The Senator was co-chair of a Presi-
dential campaign, president of one of
the largest real estate companies in
the country, and, yes, as has been men-
tioned, he was a Georgia Bulldog. All of
that by 1990. That is impressive, but
that is not what captured me that
night.
I was totally unaware of all those
things. Nor could it have been his fu-
ture, because none of us knew, none of
us knew what might be yet. That was
so many years ago.
The fact that JOHNNY would one day
run and be elected to the State Senate,
that he would be a candidate for U.S.
Senate in 1996, he would head the State
School Board, be elected to the U.S.
House in 1999, sworn in by the great
JOHN LEWIS, and then 5 years later
elected to the United States Senate as
our senior Senator.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9045
November 19, 2019
There was something so much more,
JOHNNY. There was so much more than
that, Senator, that we had yet to
know. I mean, it was more than the
Senator’s resume. It was more than the
Senator’s title, and it was more than
what the Senator was going to accom-
plish that stirred me or that stirs any
individual.
It was on that night in 1990 where a
man I had never met with a name I cer-
tainly couldn’t pronounce with a his-
tory that I didn’t know or a future yet
untold, he caught my attention. My
first true interaction, my first impact
by a political figure in my life was that
night in 1990.
The results were not what the Sen-
ator had hoped for at the time or what
the Senator had worked for, and yet,
he was in a room of friends and sup-
porters and had to address them that
night.
Now, if you were an onlooker like
me, a 20-year-old college student, what
do you expect? You expect maybe there
is going to be bitterness, there is going
to be regret, there is going to be some
blaming, there is going to be some divi-
siveness. That certainly sounds famil-
iar, certainly today. But it was dif-
ferent.
Instead, JOHNNY ISAKSON, he took the
stage with grace, with respect, with
dignity, with vision and with a con-
fidence that I never expected in a per-
son. And whether the Senator knew it
that night at that time, he chose to
impact, and he chose to inspire. He
chose to inspire me.
I know the story is not unique to me.
I know it is not. There are 45 years of
stories like that. I just happened to be
one. He was paying forward before it
was even a thing to do. And now 29
years later I can stand before each of
you, I stand before you as one who
served in the Georgia House for 71⁄2
years and now in my 10th year here in
Congress and a future still yet untold.
I get to stand before the Senator and
say, ‘‘thank you.’’
I thank Senator ISAKSON. I thank
him for caring. I thank him for being
an example of what is needed so much
today. It is with deep gratitude that I
get to pay tribute in his farewell. To
the one who might have lost an elec-
tion in 1990 but won the trust of a 20-
year-old college student that night, a
true fighter for Georgia, a great states-
man, and a dear friend, thank you so
much, and may God bless the Senator
in the days ahead.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. I
yield to the gentleman from Georgia
(Mr. BISHOP), my friend and colleague.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
yielding, and I thank my colleagues for
this Special Order giving tribute to a
good and great man.
Winston Churchill once said, ‘‘You
make your living by what you get. You
make your life by what you give.’’ My
friend, JOHNNY ISAKSON, has given so
much to so many for so long. He has
truly made a life.
JOHNNY ISAKSON has been a true
statesman in his remarkable career as
a public servant for Georgians. I first
met JOHNNY in 1977 where we served to-
gether in the Georgia General Assem-
bly. We developed a friendship which
has endured through our work together
in the State House, the U.S. House of
Representatives, and during his service
as our U.S. Senator from Georgia.
Throughout his career, he has not
viewed issues from a partisan perspec-
tive, but for the good of all Americans.
JOHNNY served as a Republican in both
chambers of Georgia’s State legisla-
ture, but he was appointed by Georgia’s
Democratic Governor Zell Miller to be
the chairman of the Georgia State
Board of Education. His integrity, his
kindness are invaluable qualities in a
legislator and have no doubt been a de-
fining measure of his success.
I am honored to call JOHNNY my
friend. We will miss him in the delega-
tion. His loss will be felt deeply, but we
can all agree that he is very much de-
serving of a happy retirement spent
with his wife, Dianne, their children,
and grandchildren, and we wish you the
best, JOHNNY.
The poet said:
Isn’t it strange how princes and kings,
and clowns that caper in sawdust rings,
and common people, like you and me,
are builders for eternity?
Each is given a list of rules;
a shapeless mass; a bag of tools.
And each must make your life as flown,
a stumbling block, or a stepping stone.
The people of Georgia, the people of
our Nation, and, indeed, people all
across the world are so blessed that
you have used your life and your career
not as a stumbling block but as a step-
ping stone for a higher, better quality
of life for human kind. Thank you, and
God bless you.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Sen-
ator ISAKSON, as well, for his service to
our Nation’s veterans and his role as
chairman of the Senate Committee on
Veterans’ Affairs. He served our mili-
tary veterans faithfully for many,
many years.
I yield to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. COLLINS), my friend and col-
league, one of the men who serves us in
multiple capacities, both in the Air
Force and as a Member of Congress.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Thank you,
Mr. SCOTT, for yielding. To be here, to
hear just the accomplishments of Sen-
ator ISAKSON. He’s one of the people
that as you go along you find in life
that you have to know him by title or
you have to know him by last name, in
the State of Georgia when you say,
‘‘JOHNNY,’’ everybody knows who you
are talking about, especially when it
comes to our politics.
And for me to rattle off everything
that has already been said, it is breath-
taking what you have done and what
you have accomplished from business
to career, and those are the things that
are worthy of the page in your life.
But for many of us here, just as my
friends were saying earlier, the Senator
has a personal attachment to many of
us, whether he realizes it or not. For
those of us who come forward in public
service, you need role models and men-
tors, and you hear about those who
succeeded and failed and succeeded and
failed, which is something many of us
have to get used to, whether we want
to or not.
For me it is watching the Senator in
the times when probably he didn’t
know he was being watched. There
were times when I watched the Sen-
ator, as a young person in the State
House in Georgia going to a meeting
and they would recognize him and say,
you know, JOHNNY is here, would he
like to say a few words?
And for most of us, it is struggling
just to come up with a couple words
that actually sound good together,
much less sentences, but JOHNNY ISAK-
SON would stand up and for the next 5
minutes rattle off a speech that you
would have sworn had been honed for
years, and it touched the very soul of
everybody there.
b 1600
I was in awe. And I watched him do it
so many times. He listened. In this
business, that is pretty impressive.
That is why he got stuff done.
I remember, every time I would come
to him, there would be times when I
would be asking a question, and I
would go along, and he would listen
and answer the question. I went away
feeling better just by being with him.
I remember when I talked to him
right after he announced to us that he
was going to leave a big hole in our del-
egation. The first thing he said to me
when I picked up the phone, as he did
almost every time, was, ‘‘Doug, thank
you. You are doing a great job,’’ even
when I knew that probably wasn’t true.
When you understand, though, what
it takes to lift people up, you leave a
mark. You leave a special mark.
For those of us in politics who strug-
gled many times over the past few
years to go into groups that would call
us names and not like us even when
they supposedly were on our side, I
watched what he did. He would go into
those groups and sneak in the back
after the meeting started. They would
see him there. They would recognize
him, and he stood and spoke. He never
backed up. He never backed down. But
he made a lot of converts simply by
being there.
For those of us in public service, if he
showed me or showed anybody any-
thing, it is that being in the room,
being a participant, listening to people,
and caring about them, even if we dis-
agree with them, is the largest step we
can take to make sure that we have a
union that matters.
From me and my house, for a profes-
sion that many have taken on that
needs role models, we stand on his
shoulders. He is the giant in the room,
from our perspective of watching what
happens and how it happens.
When I got to Washington, DC, I
knew the one thing that I wanted to do

was actually pass legislation because I
had heard him say one time before:
Why do we come up here if we don’t get
anything done?
Madam Speaker, Johnny is far be-
yond the policy. He went to the heart
of people, and it will be missed in this
place. But it is alive now, and we turn
to him and that vision more than any-
thing.
Of course, as Senator ISAKSON knows,
I still represent part of Athens and
Clarke County. He is a Georgia grad-
uate, and as we say around those parts,
‘‘You are a damn good Dawg.’’
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. COLLINS
for his comments.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH),
my colleague.
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding. I am
so glad that we are gathered here today
to honor our colleague.
It is an honor to represent Georgia’s
Sixth District here in Congress, and it
is truly an honor to hold the seat that
Senator ISAKSON once held.
Senator ISAKSON has spent decades in
service to the State of Georgia and to
our great Nation. His legacy has left an
unforgettable mark on Georgia and the
United States Senate.
He is known in our community for
being a friendly neighbor and for being
a truly good man, and I am honored to
call him my friend. We share a passion,
a passion to make Georgia the best
place to live and to start a family. We
share a dedication to making America
a more perfect union.
I know that I have not been in the
Georgia delegation very long, but I
thank the gentleman for putting people
over party and for his commitment to
the best policy, which is not always
easy politics.
We live in an age where loyalty to
partisanship has too often come at the
expense of the American people, and we
live in an age where ‘‘compromise’’ has
become a dirty word. We live in an age
where the American people have be-
come disillusioned with the American
Government.
Senator ISAKSON has defied that age.
Senator ISAKSON has always been open
to that tough conversation, and he has
always been open to finding common-
sense solutions to forge uncommon
ground.
That is why I am so proud to follow
in his footsteps as the Representative
from Georgia’s Sixth Congressional
District. It is why I work so hard to
make sure that we are passing bipar-
tisan bills, bills that will help protect
the communities that we truly love.
Madam Speaker, I thank Senator
ISAKSON. I thank him so much for his
service to the people of Georgia and his
service to the freedom of our country.
Godspeed to my friend. God bless.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for her remarks.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL),
my friend and colleague.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
I am enjoying listening to the part-
nership conversation. I want to come
from a different perspective, though. I
want to talk about the partisanship
conversation.
When I was 6 years old and Senator
ISAKSON was elected as a Georgia House
member, it was 23 out of 180 members
of the house, as I recall. I don’t know
how many there were before he got
there, but being a Republican in Geor-
gia in 1976 was not a popular thing to
do.
I think about all the things that we
want to do together in this body. I
think about folks who say, ‘‘Oh, we
can’t do that. It is too hard. It is going
to take too long. Let’s do something
today, but let’s not focus on those
long-term goals.’’
You might think that when Ronald
Reagan was elected in 1980, that that
was a big jump in Georgia. As I recall,
there were still 23 members in the
Georgia House in 1980, 23 out of 180.
Somebody had to be the first one to
stand up.
We talk about partisanship in this in-
stitution, Madam Speaker, like it is a
bad thing. What I have always loved
about the Senator is that he has never
been embarrassed to be a Republican.
He knew what he believed, and he knew
why he believed it.
Now, the Senator might not like the
way someone else expresses their Re-
publican values, but he led with his
heart. He can sit right beside a Demo-
cratic hero like JOHN LEWIS, and I
can’t tell the difference when it comes
to Southern gentility, but he will never
be embarrassed to share who he is as a
Republican.
That is what it takes to grow from 23
members in a 180-member body into the
institution that TOM GRAVES had an
opportunity to serve and into the insti-
tution that so many of our colleagues
had a chance to serve.
We talk about bipartisanship as that
Holy Grail. It requires partisanship to
get there, and but for the example that
Senator ISAKSON set, we wouldn’t have
the Republican Party in Georgia, and
we wouldn’t have Isakson values in
that party.
I talked about partisanship, Madam
Speaker. I want to talk about people as
the second part of that.
I have always imagined the roughest
part about being a United States Sen-
ator is that one might lose that one-
on-one contact that one has had. In a
congressional district, we can get to
know people. We can be with them in
the community.
Senator ISAKSON’s entire career has
been about people. I watch him when
he walks into a room. Folks that I
ought to know who they are because I
have worked with them but I just can’t
remember, I see him go up and greet
them by name. Folks that have come
into the room from all different con-
gressional districts, he has a relation-
ship with them, maybe from back in
1976 when he was trying to grow the
party across the State, maybe from
back when he was leading the State
Board of Education, maybe from back
in the Sixth District, maybe from his
time as a United States Senator. He
has always put people first.
I see that in every speech he has
given in Gwinnett and Forsyth Coun-
ties. He will stand up and always thank
the staffers who are working for him.
It is his Academy Day that I enjoy
the most. That is my favorite time
that we spend together each year.
If people don’t know, Madam Speak-
er, the Isakson Academy Day is a
statewide event that brings all the
young men and women who love an op-
portunity—they could do anything
they want to with their life, but they
want to serve the United States of
America. They want to be the future
generation of leaders. Even as young as
seventh, eighth, and ninth grade, they
come to this event that Senator ISAK-
SON puts together.
Talk about all the lives that he has
changed here in this institution, don’t
even get started on the number of lives
he has changed as it relates to leader-
ship and opportunity to serve through
his Academy Day.
I think about him being a Repub-
lican’s Republican. I think about Reva
Jennings in Forsyth County. Senator
ISAKSON knows Reva. She is hard core.
For folks who don’t know, Madam
Speaker, Forsyth County is one of the
most conservative counties in the
State of Georgia—a conservative State,
a conservative county.
Reva Jennings has been building that
Republican Party up there for as long
as anyone can remember. We lost her
in an untimely way.
But while everybody loves us on our
way out the door, Senator ISAKSON
might remember a tough primary sea-
son or two where folks might come and
say: Johnny, why aren’t you more
angry about this? Why aren’t you doing
this?
As Republican primary seasons are,
we tend to eat our own. Reva Jennings,
the first time I met her, was fielding
one of those questions. Somebody came
up and said: We have to get somebody
to challenge that JOHNNY ISAKSON in
the next primary. He is soft, for a Re-
publican.
Now, we know Reva. She doesn’t have
any softness in her. She went right to
Senator ISAKSON’s steel backbone. She
went right after it. She took it to that
whole crowd of Republicans, saying:
You can poor-mouth anybody you want
to in this town, but you cannot poor-
mouth JOHNNY ISAKSON because he has
done more for the Republican Party
than anybody else in this State has,
and let me tell you how.
It is not hard to find detractors out
there these days. It is hard to build
those lifelong friendships that create
that gift of relationship that Senator
ISAKSON has offered so many.
He has offered it to me. I am grateful
to him for it. I wouldn’t be standing

here today but for the work he has
done over those years, and I thank Sen-
ator ISAKSON for that.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. SCOTT
for yielding.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), my
good friend and colleague.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank Representative SCOTT
for putting this together. Indeed, it is
something well deserved.
I rise today to recognize a great
Georgian and a great Senator.
I have been blessed in my life. I am
the grandson of a tobacco farmer and
the son of a paper mill worker, and
here I am, walking the Halls of Con-
gress.
In the short period of time that I
have had to serve here, I have wit-
nessed many great things. I got to lis-
ten to the Pope, something I never
thought I would have the opportunity
to do, one of the great religious leaders
in the world, right here in this room.
But when I think of what I saw just
a few minutes ago, when I saw not only
two great Georgians but two great
Americans, JOHN LEWIS and JOHNNY
ISAKSON, embrace, I pinch myself some-
times. How did this happen to me? How
did I get to witness all of these great
things in my life?
Madam Speaker, I thank both of
these gentlemen.
Madam Speaker, I thank especially
Senator ISAKSON. I have been fortunate
to call him a friend and a mentor for
many years. I have had many political
mentors in my life: Tom Triplett, Tom
Coleman, just to name a few, and JOHN-
NY ISAKSON.
I can remember hearing the story
from the then-minority leader of the
house of representatives in the Georgia
statehouse, when Senator ISAKSON
would tell the story of leading such a
small group that General Custer had
had better odds than he had at that
time.
b 1615
I will never forget that. It taught me
perseverance. It taught me to always
work hard and to continue on. I have
always looked at that and admired
that in you, and I appreciate it very
much.
Your dedication to our State and our
Nation has truly been unmatched. It is
something that I have admired
throughout all my time in public serv-
ice.
Senator ISAKSON, you are one of the
greatest Georgians to ever serve and
one of the only Georgians—in fact, the
only Georgian—to have ever served in
the Georgia State House, in the Geor-
gia State Senate, in the House of Rep-
resentatives, and the United States
Senate. I got three out of four. I don’t
know if I will ever make it across over
here, but if I do, I am going to catch
you because I have had the honor, as
well.
At each of those levels that you have
served, you have been successful in ad-
vancing policies for the betterment of
the State of Georgia and for the United
States of America. I think that is what
is so very important. Everywhere you
have been, every step of the way, it has
always been for the people, always been
for the betterment of our State and of
our Nation.
During a time in our political history
in which Americans seem to be increas-
ingly divided, I have always looked to
you. One of the most important
achievements I think that you have
made is to build bipartisanship, to
reach across the aisle, to come to-
gether.
I hear my staff tell the story of you
don’t hear about Senator ISAKSON
being involved in a big fight over in the
Senate, but, in the background, he is in
a knife fight and he is winning.
That is what we all aspire to do. We
all want to be known as statesmen. We
all want to be successful and win our
matches. But you are, and we don’t
even know about it most of the time.
For example, you have always been a
staunch supporter of our Nation’s vet-
erans. I think that is extremely impor-
tant for all of us to remember. You
were chair of the Veterans’ Affairs
Committee for so many years.
I have heard the stories of problems
at the VA and of Senator ISAKSON pick-
ing up the phone and calling the family
member and apologizing. Now, this is
the chair of the Senate Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee calling someone and
apologizing for them having a problem
at the VA center. Can you imagine?
But that is what we admire.
The overhaul to the VA Veterans
Choice Program, modernizing VA hos-
pitals in the MISSION Act, all of these
signed into law as a result of your ef-
forts.
Every year for over a decade, Senator
ISAKSON has held a barbecue in the
Russell Building to feed his colleagues
from both sides of the aisle.
Now at retirement at the end of this
year, the State of Georgia, the United
States of America, loses one of its
great political assets. I know you have
made the point that you are going to
sprint through the finish line, and that
is important.
I want to thank you, Senator, for
your service to our State. I want to
thank you for your service to our Na-
tion. I want to thank you for the exam-
ple that you have set for people like
me. Thank you for always being a step
above the political infighting in order
to do what you truly felt was best for
Georgians.
As you continue to do what is best
for your health, you and Dianne will
always be in my thoughts and prayers.
Thank you, Senator, for your service
to our country. God bless you.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to
how much time I have remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 18 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr.
LOUDERMILK), my friend and colleague.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker,
I thank Representative SCOTT for his
time here, and I thank him for orga-
nizing this.
This is a moment that I am sure all
of us are having mixed feelings. There
have been a lot of accolades given here
today to Senator ISAKSON, a lot of talk
about his accomplishments, which are
absolutely many.
What a lot of people don’t understand
about Georgia is we have legends.
There are legends from Georgia that, if
you go to any history book or you talk
to anybody, they will recognize those
names as Georgia.
James Oglethorpe is one of those, the
founder of Georgia. Sam Nunn, Zell
Miller, JOHN LEWIS, Dr. Martin Luther
King. Of course, everybody knows
Vince Dooley, the legendary coach of
the University of Georgia. Others, like
Tom Murphy, the longest serving
speaker of the house in the Nation,
who served in the Georgia State House,
that I know Senator ISAKSON served
with when he was in the State house.
I believe that JOHNNY ISAKSON is one
of those legends, as well. As was men-
tioned, he is the only Georgian in the
history of our State, in the history of
this Nation, to serve in both houses of
the State legislature and both Houses
of the United States legislature, an ac-
complishment no one else has ever
achieved.
Now, the one thing I know about Sen-
ator ISAKSON is the character of the
man, that he didn’t accomplish those
things because it was a personal goal;
it was because of his heart of service.
One thing that I have been able to
consistently and honestly say about
Senator ISAKSON is that he is a states-
man. That is something that seems to
be lost in the line of politics today,
those who are true statesmen.
There are some things about him and
things about statesmen that are com-
mon across the board. One is truthful-
ness. I can tell you that JOHNNY will
tell you the truth, even if it is some-
thing you don’t want to hear; but, yet,
he will tell you in a way that you will
appreciate, because he is doing it to up-
lift you and to make you better, not to
draw you down.
Faithfulness, he has been faithful to
his faith, his God, his family, his polit-
ical beliefs, his party, but, more impor-
tantly, this country and the institu-
tions that he has represented.
Another is trust, that is something
that is lacking in modern politics. But
I can tell you this: JOHNNY ISAKSON has
never ever told me something that I
ever questioned after that. If he told
you he was going to do something, it
was going to happen.
Loyalty is another area. He has al-
ways been loyal to those who are his
friends, for those he represents, for his
nation, and for his State.
Commitment, he is a very committed
person to those things which he be-
lieves in.

H9048 November 19, 2019
Civility is one of those that really is
lost today; but, as many have spoken
here today, he has not only reached
across the aisle, but he has reached
across the State to try to bring civility
back into politics.
And the last one, which I think is
most important to me, is friendship.
The mark of a statesman is all of
those, but mostly friendship.
I was in another Member of Congress’
office recently, and, Senator, there was
a poster. It made me laugh. There was
a poster on their wall that said: ‘‘If you
want a friend in Washington, get a
dog.’’ Well, I don’t think that Member
ever met JOHNNY ISAKSON, because he
is a friend not only to me; he is a friend
to Georgia. He is a friend to all of us.
He is a friend to the United States.
Senator, God bless you. Thank you
for your service to our State. Thank
you for your service to our Nation. You
will be missed.
I am so honored to be able to say I
am a friend of a legend from Georgia.
God bless you.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I would remind my
friend and colleague that Senator ISAK-
SON is a Dawg; he is a Georgia Bulldog.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN).
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank
Mr. SCOTT for organizing this time to
honor, as said here many times, a leg-
end. Of course, I never thought I would
be standing in front of two Georgia leg-
ends as I speak specifically about one.
But I do rise today to honor my great
mentor and friend, Senator JOHNNY
ISAKSON, along with greetings to
Dianne and your wonderful family.
I was there last Saturday to witness
your beloved Bulldogs beat my beloved
Auburn Tigers. Congratulations on
this. I just hope and pray that they will
go all the way for you. I think that
would be a great tribute.
JOHNNY has been a champion for the
State of Georgia for decades, a reflec-
tion of his many years of service, as
has been mentioned about all of the ac-
complishments, a life of political serv-
ice. And, also, a mention about his in-
fluence on education.
When I was first elected, I had not
been in politics before and I didn’t real-
ly know how to get things done up
here. But I, in my service on the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, was at-
tracted to a bill called the Every Stu-
dent Succeeds Act and worked fever-
ishly to get that bill passed in the
House by a margin of a mere five votes,
218–213.
Well, it just so happened that some-
time later, as we got together in Geor-
gia for lunch, JOHNNY was asking me
about that legislation. I told him, I
said we are going to return control to
the States; we are going to try to get
the Federal Government out of the
classroom so that our teachers can
have more time to teach. He quickly
became a champion in the Senate and
helped garner bipartisan support.
Now, this is the way things should
work. That bill, the Every Student
Succeeds Act, then passed the Senate
81–17 and went to a conference com-
mittee, all because of the influence of
this incredible man. When that version
then came back to the House, I am
standing right there looking at our
ranking member, and that bill passed
in this House 359–64.
I had never seen anything like that,
JOHNNY, and it is all owed to you, and
the impact on education is going to be
felt throughout this Nation. It is quite
a difference, and it shows the depths of
your influence in these Halls of Con-
gress.
And, of course, throughout your serv-
ice, you have demonstrated the true
meaning of servant leadership by al-
ways putting the needs and priorities
of Georgia first. In fact, the greatest
servant leader in history said: There is
no greater love than to give your life
for a friend. You have given a big part
your life to this country, and we are
thankful for it.
As someone who came from the busi-
ness world but had not served in public
office before, I am thankful for your
leadership. Georgia has been named the
best State to do business in for the last
7 years, and it is no coincidence that
you had a lot to do with it.
I know that I can always call on you
for sound advice and guidance. Even
though you are retiring this year, I
hope you know that we will still be
reaching out to you for advice. We will
deeply miss you and your impact, and
it will be missed for generations to
come.
There is no doubt that Georgia has
big shoes to fill, and I think our delega-
tion is up to the task, which is a testi-
mony to your leadership and an exam-
ple to me and my colleagues.
JOHNNY, please know that we will do
our best to make you proud and honor
your legacy. Robin and I wish you and
Dianne all the best during this next
chapter in your life.
God bless you and your family.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON),
my colleague, a fellow Bulldog and
Georgia Beta alumni.
Mr. FERGUSON. Senator ISAKSON—
that feels a little formal saying it.
JOHNNY, as a constituent, is how I
know you. I want to thank you so
much for your dedicated service to our
State.
As others have talked about their
first meeting with you, I remember
mine fondly. Not unlike my colleague,
Mr. GRAVES, it was at the University of
Georgia. I was a freshman, sitting on
the steps of a fraternity house, com-
pletely clueless about the world, not
having an understanding, self-absorbed.
I remember sitting on the steps as
you came—I had no idea who you
were—and you talked to us about a
brighter future. You talked to us about
what it meant to be a Georgian.
b 1630
I remember, when you left, thinking
two things from that moment, the first
is: That is maybe the nicest person
that I have ever heard from in my en-
tire life.
Secondly, I was pretty touched that
someone was looking out for my future
that didn’t even know me.
Over the years as I watched you and
began to follow you, I saw that play
out firsthand. I saw how important the
State of Georgia was to you, and what
made it important was the millions of
Georgians that you love and care
about; the ones that you don’t know;
the ones that you do know; and the
ones that are yet to come.
Your unwavering commitment to
make our State and this Nation a bet-
ter place for all of us is something that
can never be forgotten.
You have set a standard for being a
gentleman and a statesman that we
should all follow. It is pretty remark-
able that we, as the Georgia delega-
tion, are getting to sit here today and
not only speak to you, but our dear
colleague, JOHN LEWIS, as well. Because
many of those same things that we say
about you, we have to say about our
colleague, Mr. LEWIS.
There is a genuine love for our Geor-
gians, a sense of decency, a sense of op-
timism, the desire for a bright future.
All of those things come through, not
just in your words, but in your actions.
I want to thank you for your 40 years
of service to making our lives better. I
am not exactly sure what piece of leg-
islation you took up shortly after you
met me, and I had the chance to meet
you and heard from you on the steps of
a fraternity house in Athens, Georgia,
but I feel confident that whatever it
was, it made my life better many years
later. I thank the gentleman for that.
We ask that God continue to bless
you and Dianne and know that we owe
you a debt of gratitude that we will
never be able to repay. Thank you and
God bless you.
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Madam Speaker, in the last few min-
utes, I want to thank all of my col-
leagues who joined us this afternoon,
especially JOHN LEWIS, another icon
from Georgia.
Certainly, America and the world are
better off because of both of these men.
I think the strong bipartisan presence
here lends to the extraordinary impact
that Senator ISAKSON has had on our
delegation and the great respect that
we have for his service to our State and
our Nation.
Senator ISAKSON, I have been told
that I can’t call you JOHNNY on the
floor, but if I could, I would say: JOHN-
NY, we love you. Thank you for your
service to the great State of Georgia.
America and the world are better
places because of the service that you
have provided to our Nation and your
fellow man.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

f
NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE
MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from
New Mexico (Ms. HAALAND) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of
the majority leader.
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in honor of Native American
Heritage Month. And as part of this ac-
knowledgment, I wish to state that we
are on Indian land. The Nacotchtanks,
known for trading right here through-
out the Chesapeake area, were the
original inhabitants of the land we are
standing on right now.
I am a proud member of the Pueblo of
Laguna in the great State of New Mex-
ico. My mother raised me to be a Pueb-
lo woman, and as such, I have an obli-
gation to my people and the quest of
all Native American communities to
safeguard our cultures and traditions
and do all I can to ensure that our peo-
ple have a government that lives up to
its trust obligations.
Trust obligations were promises
made to all of our Tribes in exchange
for the tens of millions of acres of land
that became the United States of
America. As a child, I was taught to
value our open space, our land, our
water, and animals.
In spite of the tremendous hardships
my grandparents faced through their
experiences in living through the In-
dian boarding school era, the assimila-
tion era, and being at the forefront of
moving our people into the modern era,
I am here to advocate for the issues
and policies that will offer a clean
planet and opportunities now and for
future generations.
I am the product of generations of
people who planted and harvested since
time immemorial. My ancestors cared
for the land, respected our air and our
water, and passed down those respon-
sibilities to their future generations.
It is because of my people and the
first people on this continent that we
stand here today on this floor. In fact,
our Constitution was largely influ-
enced by the Iroquois Confederacy.
Tribes here on the East Coast had offi-
cial relationships with the crowned
heads of Europe.
When we talk about Native American
history, we must recognize that Native
American history is American history,
and throughout this history, our ances-
tors held fast to a belief that our peo-
ple would endure.
We are reminded of our resilience by
people like: Joy Harjo, from the
Muscogee Creek Nation, the first Na-
tive American poet laureate in our
country’s history, named just this
year.
Our colleague, SHARICE DAVIDS, my
sister, as one of the first Native Amer-
ican women elected to Congress in our
country’s history.
Ruth Anna Buffalo, is a citizen of the
Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation
from North Dakota, a State legislator
who is fighting to end the crisis of
missing and murdered indigenous
women and to make her State more eq-
uitable for its indigenous citizens.
Tommy Orange, a Cheyenne and
Arapaho award-winning writer from
Oakland.
Tatanka Means, a Navajo actor and
activist, and so many more.
This month is set aside to celebrate
the contributions that Native Ameri-
cans have made to our country and to
recognize that there is so much more
that the Federal Government must do
to ensure that Native nations have
every opportunity afforded to every
American, which includes healthcare,
education, public safety, housing, and
economic development.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER).
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I
thank Representative HAALAND, not
just for giving me some time to speak,
but for being such a terrific leader and
being such an important voice, both for
her district, and for people all over this
country.
She, along with SHARICE DAVIDS, are
two superstars of the freshman class
who have been just terrific in adding
their voices to this body.
I also want to recognize GWEN MOORE
who has just been a tremendous cham-
pion on behalf of Native Americans and
has been a real leader on issues like the
Violence Against Women Act and has
made a tremendous amount of progress
for Native Americans throughout this
country.
As was mentioned, November marks
Native American Heritage Month, a
time to honor the first Americans. I
am proud to represent 11 Tribes that
have called my region home since time
immemorial.
Each of these sovereign nations has
their own unique culture and tradition
and stories that add important threads
to the fabric of our Nation.
I think about some of the most ex-
traordinary moments that I have had
as a Representative:
Visiting with the Quinault Indian
Nation along with the U.S. Commission
on Civil Rights, and having conversa-
tions about some of the civil rights
challenges, not just facing the
Quinault Nation, but Native peoples
throughout this country.
Visiting the Makah Tribe during
Makah Days, and going on a hike with
the then-chairman of the Tribe, going
out to the northwestern tip of the con-
tinental United States. My daughter
was with us and she asked the Tribal
chair: ‘‘Is this the end of the world?’’
And he said, ‘‘We consider it the be-
ginning of the world.’’
Visiting the Quileute Tribe and par-
ticipating in their festival out in La
Push, which is one of the most beau-
tiful places on the planet.
Visiting with the Hoh Tribe and cele-
brating a water project that that Tribe
had led the way on and touring with
their Tribe and seeing some amazing
assets and also seeing some of the real
challenges that they have.
Just recently visiting the Chehalis
Tribe, seeing some of their enterprises
and seeing the value of the work that
they do, how much it contributes to
the local economy there, and how
much it means to their ability to pro-
vide services to their Tribal members.
Visiting the Lower Elwha Klallam
Tribe and visiting their ancestral lands
and seeing the dam removal project
that occurred there that is giving new
birth to the environment there in that
region.
Visiting with multiple generations of
the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe, vis-
iting their leaders and hearing about
the important role that fishing and
shellfish growing has meant for their

H9050 November 19, 2019
I could talk about others, the Tulalip
Tribe that recently hosted an impor-
tant conversation about protecting
Puget Sound and honoring Billy Frank
Jr.
Madam Speaker, the Snoqualmie
Tribe, from your district, visited with
me just today. That is a Tribe that is
very important in our region, and in
their ancestral homelands is where I
almost proposed to my wife before I
chickened out.
These communities have shown us
the importance of caring for iconic
natural resources like salmon and
shellfish that are found throughout the
Pacific Northwest and have fought to
protect our land and waters, not just
for themselves, but for future genera-
tions.
They have shown all of us the impor-
tance of honoring and respecting the
role of our elders, and never forgetting
the time-honored traditions that are
passed down.
They have defended our freedom by
putting on the uniform of the United
States military. They play a key role
in driving our local economies.
This month, Native American Herit-
age Month, reminds us that we have an
opportunity to build a foundation of
cooperation as partners to secure a
brighter future for Tribes, not just in
the Pacific Northwest, but all around
this country.
Unfortunately, the Federal Govern-
ment has failed to uphold the promises
made to these communities far too
often. So, today, as we mark Native
American Heritage Month, I want to
affirm my commitment, and I think all
of my colleagues want to affirm their
commitments, to ensuring that the
Federal Government honors its treaty
and trust obligations.
I am grateful that earlier today the
House Natural Resources Committee
held an oversight hearing on the recent
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report
called: ‘‘Broken Promises: Continuing
Federal Funding Shortfall for Native
Americans.’’
A couple of years back I called on the
Commission on Civil Rights to produce
this report, to give Congress a roadmap
for how to meet its treaty and trust ob-
ligations for Indian Country. I am
proud to see Congress taking concrete
steps to address the recommendations
outlined in this report.
The decisions we make today should
be with an eye toward how they will af-
fect our children seven generations
into the future. So I want to invite
those at home and my colleagues to
join us in celebrating the history and
culture of our Tribes and all Tribes
around this country.
Let’s recommit to working with our
Tribal partners to make a brighter fu-
ture for all.
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentlewoman from Wis-
consin (Ms. MOORE), my friend and col-
league.
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from New Mex-
ico for yielding.
I am so very pleased to join my col-
league, DEB HAALAND, as one of the
first Native American women—it is
about time—to join this body in cele-
brating Native American Heritage
Month.
It is fitting here in November, as we
think about Thanksgiving, to celebrate
Native American Heritage Month, con-
sidering the welcoming of foreigners to
this land first inhabited by the Native
peoples.
This month really allows us the op-
portunity to formally remember the
great contributions that Native Ameri-
cans have made, and they continue to
make to bridge our communities and to
improve our Nation.
All you have to do is walk right down
the street to the Smithsonian National
Museum of the American Indian to just
get a glimpse of the many ways that
Native Americans have contributed to
the fabric of our Nation, despite the
many hardships, the broken promises,
and trials they have faced.
b 1645
Indeed, as you walk through that mu-
seum, you will see the dozens and doz-
ens and dozens of documentation of the
treaties that have been executed and
violated in this country.
But the rich culture and heritage of
Native Americans have still come
through all of these hardships. They
have been an indelible and undeniable
impact on the American way of life. I
am reminded of that every single day
in my community.
In fact, I hail from Wisconsin, where
Earth Day was inaugurated by the late,
great Senator Gaylord Nelson because,
indeed, one of the things we have
learned in Wisconsin from our Native
community is to have stewardship over
our environment, one of the legacies of
the Native peoples.
My home State is proudly home to 11
federally recognized Native American
Tribes, and I am so proud of the many
contributions that these Tribes have
made to the cultural and economic
richness of my State. In fact, the city
of Milwaukee, which I represent, has a
name that is derived from some of the
Native brothers and sisters who inhab-
ited the region: the gathering place by
the water, the beautiful land, or the
pleasant land. In fact, the host com-
mittee from the Democratic National
Convention is called the Good Land
Committee.
These Tribes have helped refine and
strengthen our State. In my home city
of Milwaukee, the Forest County Pota-
watomi Foundation has not shied away
from helping to address some of the
most intractable problems facing our
communities, including high unem-
ployment, access to basic and higher
education, ensuring better access to
healthcare, and reducing health dis-
parities, among other things.
I am so inspired by the dedication of
the Forest County Potawatomi to in-
vest in Milwaukee and to give a help-
ing hand to those serving the most vul-
nerable in the broader community,
from young children to seniors in our
community.
In my life as an elected official, first
at the State level and now in Congress,
I have had so many wonderful friends
and allies in the Tribal community. As
a matter of fact, I grew up in a commu-
nity where I had many friends, and I
learned so many things from my Na-
tive friends.
I am extremely honored to now serve
in this body with the first Native
American women—what a difference
one session makes—who have been
elected to this body and to be able to
work across the aisle, even before they
arrived, with concerned colleagues
with Native backgrounds, such as Mr.
COLE and Mr. YOUNG, on legislation to
address the needs of Native Americans.
Madam Speaker, I want to take just
a few seconds, if the gentlewoman from
New Mexico will indulge me, to rein-
force my commitment to the first peo-
ples of this Nation. As they are citizens
of this Nation, I want to remind the
body that Native people are dual citi-
zens. Because of their treaty rights—
and it is in the Constitution—they are
sovereign nations, and we ought to
double down on our efforts of the Fed-
eral Government to fully live up to
these trust obligations.
Unfortunately, the history of our
country is not the same as our aspira-
tions. Our country’s policies toward
our Tribal communities is not a proud
one. It actually is quite horrifying,
which is why remembering, commemo-
rating, and celebrating our Native
brothers and sisters is so important, in
order to remember the great things but
also to remind us of where we have fall-
en short so that we learn from our past
and that our history never repeats
itself.
You have heard some of the things
that my sister DEB HAALAND has talked
about here. She talked about the abro-
gation of families and moving Native
American people into assimilation pro-
grams. Part of that legacy has come to
pass because we have not protected the
sanctity of our Tribal obligations, re-
spected sovereignty, and promoted the
political, economic, and social self-de-
termination for Native American com-
munities. This is of paramount impor-
tance if we are not to repeat the same
negative legacy.
As we celebrate this month, let us re-
dedicate ourselves to the numerous
bills and initiatives that can help make
a difference to our Native brothers and
sisters. Let this not be just some mo-
ment, some little 5 minute or Special
Order talking about how wonderful Na-
tive Americans are.
One of our key legislative priorities
this year is a strong reauthorization of
the Violence Against Women Act. For
too long, non-Native men could assault
Native American women with impu-
nity. The Violence Against Women Act
that passed the House earlier this year,
sitting over in the Senate graveyard,
would take more steps to end this

scourge by empowering Native law en-
forcement and Native courts to protect
Native American women and children
from domestic violence.
The need for affordable housing in In-
dian Country cannot be overstated.
Some of the poorest and most remote
communities in this country are Na-
tive American communities. Native
American elders and children are living
in deteriorated housing with mold and
structures that cannot protect them
against the harsh environment.
NAHASDA, the Native American
Housing Assistance and Self-Deter-
mination Act, provides Tribal govern-
ments the ability to provide safe and
affordable housing to Tribal commu-
nities that is consistent with their sta-
tus as sovereigns. We need to stop
punting and finally undertake a real
reauthorization to unlock the potential
of these programs to improve housing
for all Native Americans. I continue to
work with House and Senate colleagues
to find a path forward so we can finally
have this program reauthorized.
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentlewoman from Florida
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL).
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam
Speaker, each November, we take time
to reflect upon the lasting contribu-
tions of Native Americans in our coun-
try. The rich traditions and history of
indigenous peoples shaped our Nation’s
democracy and cultural fabric long be-
fore the writing of the Constitution.
Today, they continue to impact all
facets of American life and have en-
dured despite centuries of injustices.
We must remain mindful of our past
failures while moving forward to build
a peaceful, mutually sustainable rela-
tionship between our government and
Tribal nations.
At home, in Florida’s 26th Congres-
sional District, it is an immense privi-
lege to work with the Miccosukee
Tribe in Florida. The Miccosukee peo-
ple are dedicated to the protection of
their homeland, the Florida Ever-
glades, and have been a crucial partner
in the fight for clean water and the res-
toration of the natural flow of water
from the Kissimmee River to the Flor-
ida Bay.
I am proud to have the Miccosukee
Tribe in my district, and I am so grate-
ful for their vital participation in the
protection and the prosperity of south
Florida. As our country faces new chal-
lenges, we should strive to include in-
digenous voices in our national con-
versation.
This month, let’s commit to hon-
oring the legacy of Native nations and
celebrating the indispensable contribu-
tions of the first Americans.
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentleman from Hawaii
(Mr. CASE).
(Mr. CASE asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I deeply
appreciate my friend and colleague
from New Mexico leading this Special
Hour and yielding me time to join in
recognizing November as Native Amer-
ican Heritage Month, a time for us to
reflect on and celebrate the rich his-
tories and diverse cultures of our Na-
tion’s indigenous peoples.
It is said that cultural heritage is the
sum total of the unique ways of living
of a culture handed down from genera-
tion to generation, be they customs,
practices, places, objects, artistic ex-
pressions, language, and values, all
amounting to a distinct identity and
integrity as a people.
By that measure, most Americans
have some familiarity with the rich
cultural heritage of the indigenous peo-
ples of the continental United States
and Alaska. It is indeed gratifying to
listen to my colleagues speak of the
rich diversity within our continental
United States, from New Mexico to
Florida to Washington and Wisconsin.
As we celebrate the heritage, iden-
tity, and integrity of these great peo-
ples this month, I want to highlight
that of another indigenous peoples of
our country, the Native Hawaiians.
Because of Hawaii’s geographical dis-
tance from the U.S. mainland and our
unique history with the United States,
most Americans are not aware of the
almost 600,000 among us who identify,
in whole or in part, as Native Hawai-
ian. Some 50 percent still live in my
home State of Hawaii, and I am deeply
humbled to represent a native group
with such a deep and rich heritage all
its own.
Today’s Kanaka Maoli are descend-
ants of the original voyagers who made
the incredible journey from Kahiki, to-
day’s Tahiti and the Marquesas, some-
where around 1,500 years ago, a full
1,000 years before the universally rec-
ognized indigenous peoples of New Zea-
land, the Maori, arrived in Aotearoa.
By the arrival of the West through
Captain Cook in 1778, Native Hawaiians
had already long developed, practiced,
and handed down a truly unique cul-
tural heritage, from their own lan-
guage, dance, and music to customs
and practices, values, and religion.
They were truly their own people, in
every sense of the word.
However, like virtually all other in-
digenous peoples throughout our coun-
try and world, the Kanaka Maoli en-
dured cultural marginalization and dis-
crimination to the point that, by the
middle of the 20th century, their cul-
tural heritage was at risk for extinc-
tion, as has happened with most other
indigenous cultures throughout our
history.
Beginning in the mid-1960s, though, a
renewed interest in traditional Hawai-
ian arts and culture began to emerge,
driving deep cultural pride and resur-
gence. The ranks of prominent Native
Hawaiians include figures such as
George Na’ope, a kumu hula who, with
others, brought back the study and
practice of ancient hula. I had the
honor of presenting ‘‘Uncle George’’ as
a 2006 National Heritage Fellow here,
our Nation’s highest honor in folk and
traditional arts.
The Hawaiian language itself had vir-
tually disappeared after statehood. But
in 1982, a small group of Hawaiian lan-
guage educators came together and
formed the Punana Leo preschools,
which focused on nurturing a new gen-
eration of Native Hawaiian speakers
through education in the Native Ha-
waiian language, the Olelo. The first
school was established in 1984 in
Kekaha, Kauai. Today, there are many
such schools and thousands of Native
Hawaiian language speakers.
Another ancient practice prominent
in the Hawaii renaissance was the art
of Polynesian voyaging. Hundreds of
years had passed since the last voyage,
and the ancient ways of navigating had
been lost. But in 1975, the Polynesian
Voyaging Society built the Hokule’a, a
traditional outrigger canoe first cap-
tained by Elia Kawika David
Ku’ualoha, whose mission was to follow
in the footsteps of Native Hawaiians
and sail unaided across Polynesia.
Today’s voyaging canoes sail freely
across the Pacific and even around the
world in the ancient ways, an amazing
symbol of cultural recovery.
These kanaka are just a few of the
tens of thousands of Native Hawaiians
and others who simply decided that the
rich cultural heritage of the indigenous
peoples of Hawaii would not die but
would be carried forward into genera-
tions to come. Their stories, and the
story of all Native Hawaiians, should
not be left unrecognized by this Con-
gress, either today or in the laws of our
country focused on indigenous peoples.
I am honored to recognize them and
their special contributions and legacy
to our great country and to join all of
my colleagues who advocate so force-
fully for our indigenous peoples.
Madam Speaker, again, ‘‘mahalo nui
loa,’’ thank you very much, to the gen-
tlewoman from New Mexico for bring-
ing us together to celebrate Native
American Heritage Month. May all
Americans reflect on the diverse cul-
tural legacy gifted to all of us by all in-
digenous peoples of our Nation.
b 1700
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, this
Native American Heritage Month, let
us pay honor and respect to those who
came before us. Let us never forget the
genocide and racism that is so much of
our history. Let us all work together to
ensure that the future for the Native
Americans and Native Hawaiians in
our country is as promising as it is for
any American living here currently.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on the subject of my Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico?
There was no objection.
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.

HEALTHCARE COSTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker,
my wife accuses me of not being able to
speak without a chart, so now, when I
am home, I walk around with a chart
for my 4-year-old, trying to explain
what being a good girl is. So far, it is
not working.
We try to do this every week, but to-
night, I am going to try to put some
more details into last week’s presen-
tation.
The reason I have this first board up
is, once again, to show the math on the
single biggest threat, I believe, to our
country and to our society and the ab-
surdity that this body isn’t dealing
with it.
If you look at this chart, this is from
the Manhattan Institute. It is now sev-
eral months old. It is the 30-year win-
dow. I am going to try to make this all
make sense.
If you remove Social Security and
Medicare, we have $23 trillion in the
bank 30 years from now. If you pull So-
cial Security and Medicare into the
numbers, you see up on the top line,
you are $103 trillion in debt.
If you, then, normalize it for, I be-
lieve, inflation-adjusted dollars, con-
stant dollars, it is like $83 trillion in
debt. You are a couple hundred percent
of debt to GDP. You have blown up the
society.
Why can’t we just have an honest
conversation that our debt driver is de-
mographics? It is the healthcare por-
tion of the demographics. How do we
have a revolution here around the cost,
the availability of healthcare, instead
of the absurd conversation we have
around this place all the time where it
is about the financing?
Once again, let’s be honest, the ACA,
what many know as ObamaCare, was
substantially a financing mechanism,
who got subsidized, who had to pay.
Our Republican alternative was a fi-
nancing mechanism. It was about who
had to pay and who got subsidized in-
stead of what to pay. The what-to-pay
discussion is so difficult because you
really do challenge a lot of our vested
interests, a lot of our friends, a lot of
preconceptions.
Just as a quick thought experiment
to have this make sense, I think Re-
publicans and Democrats both sort of
like the idea of telemedicine. Okay,
great. But most of us end up thinking
of telemedicine as I am going to grab
my phone and talk to a nurse or a doc-
tor. You haven’t thought it through
that, the fact of the matter is, where
the technology is at today, you should
have one or two body sensors on, and
you should be talking to an avatar that
is reading your body sensors that is
doing an algorithm that can give you
incredibly accurate information. That
would crash the price of that telemedi-
cine.
But that is hard because that isn’t
the model that we all think of. We
don’t future-proof our thinking of un-
derstanding where the technology is
today. If we don’t do that, we don’t hit
the cost breakthroughs.
As you look at the math here, you
will start to see about two-thirds—ac-
tually, in some ways, it becomes three-
quarters if you work through some of
the math—of the next 30 years is Medi-
care. It is the unfunded liabilities in
Medicare of what we are going to spend
and what it would cost to finance it.
Remember, the next 5 years, just the
growth of Social Security, Medicare,
healthcare entitlements equals the en-
tire Defense Department. Every 10
years—that is two full Defense Depart-
ments—is just the growth.
The next 10 years, 91 percent of our
spending growth will be Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, and healthcare entitle-
ments. Is that Republican or Demo-
cratic? It is just demographics.
It is one of my great heartbreaks:
The Ways and Means Committee, about
3 weeks ago, moved a piece of legisla-
tion called H.R. 3—and I am going to
try to tie this in on why the mecha-
nism in that bill is so bad for the fu-
ture disruption in healthcare to crash
the price and make us all healthier.
The advertised headline is: H.R. 3 is
about reference pricing U.S. pharma-
ceuticals to the five key European
countries, and we will adopt their pric-
ing mechanism.
Do understand the revolution we are
on the cusp of. A few years ago, this
body, with a Democratic President and
a Republican Congress, passed some-
thing called the Cures Act. We created
new channels and other ways to fi-
nance some speedier approvals for the
drugs that are often referred to as bio-
logics.
We have the cure for hemophilia
here. We are going to talk about cystic
fibrosis and other miracles that are
here. Remember, 5 percent of our
brothers and sisters, the chronic popu-
lation—that 5 percent—is the majority
of our healthcare spending. If you want
to have a revolution in healthcare
costs, do the two things I keep pro-
posing over and over: adopt and legal-
ize technology that allows us to be
healthier. Legalize the data, the ability
for the thing you blow into that tells
you that you have the flu. Legalize it
so it can order your antivirals.
The technology disruption is there to
keep us healthy.
The other side is the revolution is
here to cure our just horrible, debili-
tating diseases, but they are really ex-
pensive because we are dealing with
very small populations and incredibly
expensive research.
The miracles are here, and God forbid
if H.R. 3 were to become the law, the
model itself. As you dig in and dig in
and dig in, you understand that many
of the things that would help us crash
the future price of healthcare get
ripped away from us because those cu-
rative, revolutionary biologics, small
molecules, even some of the synthetic
genome type pharmaceuticals, don’t
happen.
The logic is very simple, and we have
seen this before in U.S. pharmaceutical
manufacturing. If there is not the big
reward for the really big risks, you re-
move the really big risks and just basi-
cally take today’s pharmaceutical,
make small improvements, small ad-
justments, and that is what you mar-
ket. That is where we were 20 years
ago, even 10 years ago.
The disruption really has happened
just in the last few years because of
what we did here in this body by get-
ting the policy right and, also, tech-
nology.
Part of the thought experiment to
understand what those who support
H.R. 3—you have to understand what
you are voting for or what you are pur-
suing.
Over the weekend, I was reading
some of the mechanisms that are used
in Great Britain. There is a formula.
Let’s say you had a new pharma-
ceutical. It is being presented to the
folks who do the pricing in the Na-
tional Health Service in Great Britain.
How do they price it?
One of the key aspects of their for-
mula is very simple. It says if this were
to extend someone 1 year of healthy
life, what is that worth? In Great Brit-
ain, it is $38,000. If this pharmaceutical
costs $40,000 but were to give you 1
more year of healthy life, it doesn’t get
purchased.
We are going to import that formula?
Look, we need to do something with
pharmaceutical prices, but there are
things we can do on the financing side,
on the incentives of the capital that
goes in, the healthcare bond that I
have come over and over to this floor
and talked about as the way to finance
the really, really expensive disruptive
pharmaceuticals.
When we are doing a reference pric-
ing in this pharmaceutical, if it is in
Great Britain, it can be sold only if it
is under that $38,000 for being healthy
for a year. Is that really the reference
pricing mechanism we are all ready to
go for? It sounds great until you start
to understand what is underneath it.
Let’s walk through my incredible op-
timism of the technology cusp we are
on the side of but, also, how this body
is going to have to figure out how we
make these cures available.
You all saw the news, and I just put
up this board because it is something I
care a lot about, cystic fibrosis—only
about 30,000 Americans.
Some of the best efficacy drugs we
have right now only take care of about
6, maybe up to 20 percent of the popu-
lation. We have a breakthrough. We
have a huge breakthrough, but it is
going to be, at least the current model
right now—and it is a combination of
different drugs functionally built on
decades of research. But it is going to
be about $311,000 a year.
If you suffer with this disease, does
our society have a moral obligation to

you for you to have another healthy
year where we have functionally found
a discovery that helps basically sta-
bilize a disease where you functionally
drown in your own lungs? What is the
moral obligation? Are you going to test
that up against $38,000 for 1 more year
of good life? Because that is function-
ally what you are being asked to put
into the formula.
Instead, shouldn’t we be pushing for
the next revolution of saying how we
permanently cure these diseases so
that 5 percent of our population, which
is the majority of our healthcare
spending, we start to cure our brothers
and sisters?
One of the other very hopeful things
from last year is a pharmaceutical
combination that looks like it sta-
bilizes ALS. The drug looks like it is
going to be expensive. You may need
one, two, or three shots a year, but it
stabilizes you. The drug may be $100,000
for that shot. It turns out that is dra-
matically less expensive than someone
regressing with their ALS. I mean, if
you have to put it on a calculator, it
turns out this is a good investment. Do
we intend to deny this drug?
How about the research that is going
on in Arizona right now? Arizona State
University, the biggest university in
the country and my alma mater, has a
major project going on right now. I will
do my best to try to describe this the
way a couple of the researchers and
professors have described it to me.
We have all heard the CAR T therapy
right now, where you can take a cancer
you have and sort of see what titers—
how your body is reacting to it. We fig-
ured out, with the CAR T process, let’s
give your body the immunotherapy.
Let’s grow those cells and go attack
that cancer.
We figured out that we can cure lots
of types of cancer. There was even a
great article out a couple of weeks ago
on heart scar tissue. It turns out it is
more than cancer. We can do other
things. This is wonderful.
But someone really smart a few years
ago said, well, hold it. If we can build
an immunotherapy—forgive me if I am
mispronouncing it; I have had a lot of
coffee today—that goes after a cancer,
why wouldn’t we figure out lots of dif-
ferent types of cancers, look at human
body reaction, what the T cells say,
and build a vaccine that says, hey, it
turns out these 16, 17 immune re-
sponses to all of these different types
of cancer, we could turn your body on,
educate your body like a vaccine does,
that if one of those cancer types
popped up in your body, you already
have your body’s reaction ready to go
and attack it.
It is brilliant because we know it is
over here. We know we can do it on the
individual cancers. Why not now turn
it into a vaccine that covers dozens of
different types?
They are working on it. This is in-
credibly expensive, incredibly high
risk. The odds are it will not work. But
if it does, what does it do to the health
costs of this country?
Do we have a moral obligation to at
least not rip this opportunity away?
My fear is that bills like H.R. 3 do in-
credible violence to that future that is
incredibly optimistic.
This slide is almost impossible to
read, but this slide is about diabetes
and the Medicare population. You re-
member how the first slide we were
talking about that Medicare, in many
ways, its cost—remember, when you
pay your FICA tax, all we are col-
lecting in that, all your government is
collecting in that, is really the part A,
the hospital portion. The other parts
are general fund spending.
b 1715
Turns out that 30-year projection, we
found some data that was saying 30
percent of that looks like it is going to
be diabetes costs.
Could you imagine a cure for diabe-
tes?
Now, you have 1 and 2. We need to
deal with obesity. We also need to fin-
ish the research that would allow pan-
creatic cells to start producing insulin,
some way to reactivate the human
body to basically make its own insulin.
That revolution we actually think we
have going in a lab right now. It is in-
credibly expensive research, and mul-
tiple, multiple, multiple lines of this
research have failed. But that single
cure of diabetes would have the single
greatest fiscal impact on this country’s
future.
Think about it. If I come to you and
say: Hey, take a look. Just Medicare
and Social Security over the next 30
years, it is like $103 trillion of debt, of
borrowing and interest costs. If ad-
justed for current dollars, maybe it is
around $83 trillion. Three-quarters of
that, two-thirds of that, is just Medi-
care. If you cure diabetes, you reduce
that by a third.
That is an example of are we about to
destroy our own future for great polit-
ical theater today on a formula that
can’t work, and there are dozens of
ways to cheat, which I won’t even go
into today because I did that once be-
fore on the floor, walked through all
the different ways you can cheat on
H.R. 3.
This isn’t Republican; this isn’t Dem-
ocrat. It is just science. It is demo-
graphics. It is math.
Why can’t we come together, as a
body, and say we need the disruption of
technology over here to keep us
healthy, and the disruption of tech-
nology over here to cure—we need to
work out financing mechanisms and in-
centives to keep this going. And over
here, we need to change a lot of laws,
because a lot of this technology over
here is actually illegal.
One of the reasons I come to this
floor every week is we are trying to
convince our fellow Members and any-
one who is willing to listen: There is a
path that our country does not have to
fall off the debt cliff. There is a path
our country does not have to wake up
one day and have a debt crisis.
We have offered pieces of legislation,
everything from how to manage parts
of the debt, everything from long-term
bonds to something called trills, which
is like an equity interest in debt as a
way to provide some stability, some
robustness in the capital markets, all
the way to actually building a layered
policy that has everything from tax,
regulatory, immigration, trade policies
that maximize economic growth to in-
centives for individuals to be in the
labor force—we have done lots of pres-
entations on the floor of those—incen-
tives to change the rules around tech-
nology, and that is partially what we
are talking about today, incentives for
older workers to not instantly lose
benefits or not have their benefits de-
cline where there is a disincentive not
to work.
We need our brothers and sisters in
the labor force because this next chart
is really, really important. Remember,
this is only 1998 to 2028, and it is a lit-
tle hard at this angle.
But understand, if you and I were
here, 1998—it doesn’t feel like it is that
long ago. If you were to look at the
youngest quartiles, let’s say the 16 to
24s, it was 15.9 percent of our popu-
lation. In 8 years, 9 years, it is only
111⁄2 percent of our population.
Understand the demographic winds
we are driving into. And this is why so
many of the economists, before we did
the tax reform, came to us and said:
DAVID, we know we need to fix the cor-
porate Tax Code. President Obama has
talked about this his whole time here.
But you can’t grow that much. You
can’t produce healthy labor markets
because you are getting too old as a so-
ciety.
Well, it turns out that is wrong. It
turns out we are breaking almost all
the rules of all the economic textbooks
I grew up with. But this chart is crit-
ical to understand.
So, if you take a look at the top
quartile here, which is 55 years and
older—1998, it is not that long ago.
That was 12.4 percent of the popu-
lation. In 8 years, it is 25.2 percent of
the population.
Do you see a trend here? Because I
swear to you, it feels like Congress
didn’t know there were baby boomers
that were going to start turning 65.
I swear to you, if you think about
this place and the crazy debates we
have, the childish math that is brought
here, where people just make stuff up—
I am sorry. It is one of our running
jokes in our family that I went to Con-
gress, a place that doesn’t own a calcu-
lator.
This drives all our policy. This is
what drives the costs in Social Secu-
rity, Medicare. This is what drives our
debt.
There are things we can do to grow
the economy and provide, if we intend
to keep our promises, but my fear is
the immediate satiation of rage and
politics in this body blinds us to the
thing that is most important for all of
us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9054 November 19, 2019
So, once again, when we did tax re-
form, we were told the two fragilities
that were going to keep it from actu-
ally working. One was capital stock.
Well, it turns out all the economists
got that wrong. Turns out capital
stock, Americans saved a lot more of
the tax reform dollars than we ever
modeled for.
Turns out that the repatriation—you
saw the report, and this is from, I
think, a full quarter ago—$140 billion
more came in than we ever modeled.
And also, because we have such a
healthy economy, capital is coming in
from all over the world.
It turns out the United States is
awash in capital. We broke the formula
on capital stocks, so there is investable
capital to invest in people and their
ideas and the growth.
But the other fragility we ran into
that all the fancy economists were tell-
ing us is labor availability: DAVID, you
can’t get, really, over 61 percent labor
force participation next year. As a
matter of fact, our model predicts we
are going to start to fall under 60.
You have got to understand, we are
getting so old, and there are so many
problems with millennials and millen-
nial males. And let’s face it, we have to
deal with the realities of opioid and
other types of addiction in our society.
And they were right, except they
were wrong on the actual numbers. We
now have blown through 63—what was
it?—63.3 percent labor force participa-
tion in the last report.
I know this is geeky, but it is a big
deal. It is a demonstration that, if we
can grow, if we can encourage our
brothers and sisters to be in the labor
force—and it does mean this body
needs to change many of the rules to
make it easier and not a fiscal cliff on
someone’s benefits to go into the labor
force. We are going to have to adopt
the technology that scares and creates
disruption.
And the simple thought experiment I
will give you, Madam Speaker: Did you
go to Blockbuster Video last weekend?
Of course not. It is sort of silly, but it
is the same thing.
Doesn’t it feel like we all woke up
one night and, instead of going and get-
ting the little silver disk, we go home
and hit a button and we watch Netflix
or HBO Go, now Disney.
The fact of the matter is, in that
world, we allowed the disruptive tech-
nologies to become part of our lives.
We need to do that same thing. We
need to change many of the incentives
for older workers to be in the labor
force. And then the Holy Grail, which
will be very difficult, is: Do we need to
change some of the incentives within
the benefits themselves?
Remember, these are earned benefits.
We have a societal contract with those
who have become older.
Are there incentives and things we
can design into that to actually help
on the demographic actuarial curve?
There are, and we have actually talked
about those on this floor.
So this chart here is just a very sim-
ple one to talk about labor force par-
ticipation, and you have got to under-
stand there is a math miracle here.
Is it possible to have 164,000 people
enter a labor market when you are al-
ready down to 3.6 percent unemploy-
ment? I will tell you, lots of the econo-
mists would have said no. At that
point, you have hit full employment.
There are not even that many available
workers. What we are seeing is workers
who are not looking, so they are not in
that unemployment number, coming
back into the labor force.
That actually tells you we have this
thing called elasticity. It also means
the growth curve is still ahead of us. If
we can hit that curve and keep rising,
we can do amazing things.
And so, to the tie-in slide, I am try-
ing to make the point—I know this
slide is getting a little beaten on. I am
trying to make the point for anyone
who will listen, there is a path, but it
is not a path where you get to do one
or two shiny objects. We have to do all
the policies together because they
interlink.
What we do in tax reform has things
to do with labor participation. Labor
participation will have effects on your
immigration needs and moving to a
talent-based immigration system.
Well, it turns out those will actually
have effects on family formation. It all
ties together.
And this body, we are now in our 11th
month, and we have done nothing. We
have functionally done nothing of
value for this country. We should be
ashamed.
I have a 4-year-old daughter. The rea-
son I ran again, the reason I am going
to run again is I am going to find some
way that her future will be better than
mine. I will find some way to have our
brothers and sisters understand the
basic math, that there is a path.
But doing crazy, doing rage, doing
anger, doing just theater doesn’t get us
anywhere. There is a path, and it turns
out this stuff isn’t Republican or Dem-
ocrat. It is just good policy.
So, Madam Speaker, thank you for
tolerating me, and, Dear Lord, I hope
we are starting to make some progress
here.
I yield back the balance of my time.

Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2019 No. 185
Senate
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. To-
day’s opening prayer will be offered by
Msgr. Anthony J. Marcaccio, of St.
Pius X, from Greensboro, NC.
The guest Chaplain offered the fol-
lowing prayer:
Let us pray.
Blessed are You Lord, God of all cre-
ation. You are the giver of every good
gift, of life and liberty, of peace and
prosperity, of wisdom, understanding,
and right judgment.
We ask that in Your divine mercy,
You would bless our Republic and espe-
cially the work of our Senators, that
they may discern ‘‘all that is true, all
that is honorable, all that is right, all
that is excellent and worthy of praise’’
for our Nation.
In this moment, make us mindful of
all that has brought us together as a
country, and how it far surpasses that
which can divide us, so in all things de-
liberated and done here, we may be pre-
served as one Nation under God. Amen
and Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
FISCHER). The President Pro Tempore.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to address the
Senate for 1 minute as in morning busi-
ness.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD FOR
RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARDS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, a
whole bunch of us Midwest biofuel Sen-
ators sent a cover letter with our com-
ments to President Trump. Those com-
ments were in regard to the biofuel
rules that are out for public comment.
The President has been a supporter of
biofuels and the EPA shouldn’t under-
cut President Trump’s support of RFS.
I urge the EPA and Administrator
Wheeler to adjust the proposed supple-
mental rule to account for actual
waived gallons, using hard data from
past practices, to send an unambiguous
signal to the marketplace.
I am glad to have the opportunity to
comment, and I encourage all farmers,
biofuel producers, and anybody else in-
terested in supporting the RFS to
make their comments. Those com-
ments should be along the lines of what
was agreed to in the Oval Office on
September 12, which the EPA regula-
tions don’t reflect properly.
So tell the EPA that you want the
September 12 agreement agreed to. Go
to regulations.gov or to the Iowa Farm
Bureau or Iowa Corn websites before
the deadline on November 27 to tell the
EPA to stand behind the President’s
Oval Office agreement.
I yield the floor.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
my colleagues are well familiar with
my repeated calls for bipartisan
progress in funding the Federal Gov-
ernment. For more than 2 months, as
the appropriations process idled at par-
tisan roadblocks, I pointed out just
how straightforward this entire process
could have been. With the road map ne-
gotiated in July by the President and
the Speaker, and approved by each of
the congressional leaders, we had the
necessary commitments to move for-
ward in good faith and avoid partisan
riders that would stall the entire ef-
fort, but, of course, that didn’t happen.
But failing to secure funding for the
Federal Government before the end of
the year is not an option. Chairman
SHELBY continues to lead efforts to set-
tle on subcommittee allocations that
can earn bipartisan support. Today,
these efforts are ongoing, and with our
deadline to prevent a funding lapse rap-
idly approaching, I am encouraged that
the House will apparently be voting
today on a continuing resolution to
keep the Government funded until De-
cember 20, while talks continue. These
talks must continue because it is vital
that we work in good faith to fund im-
portant priorities for the coming year,
but what is needed in the near term is
to keep the Government open for the
next several weeks while this work
goes on.
This is not rocket science. The House
needs to send us the short-term fund-
ing bill which the Senate can pass and
which the President will sign. That is
the way to keep the government open
while our important discussions con-
tinue to make progress toward closing
out the appropriations process and get-
ting full-year bills to the floor.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on another matter, for weeks Repub-
licans have been trying to move for-
ward significant bipartisan legislation
for the American people. Senate Re-
publicans are trying to get our Demo-
cratic colleagues to let us consider de-
fense funding. House Republicans have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6632 November 19, 2019
Alas, our Democratic colleagues have
not been willing to budge on any of
those things. As a result, while the
Senate waits for the House to send us
short-term funding legislation, we will
spend our time on the personnel busi-
ness.
Yesterday, we advanced the nomina-
tion of Justice Robert Luck, of Florida,
to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Elev-
enth Circuit, with the support of a bi-
partisan majority.
Justice Luck brings an impressive
and well-rounded legal record, includ-
ing a clerkship on the Eleventh Cir-
cuit, service in the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice for the Southern District of Flor-
ida, and years spent ruling from the
State bench.
Today, we will also advance the nom-
ination of Justice Barbara Lagoa, of
Florida, also to serve on the Eleventh
Circuit Court of Appeals. A graduate of
Columbia University School of Law,
Justice Lagoa has spent years prac-
ticing law, serving as a Federal pros-
ecutor, and ruling from both the State
appellate bench and the Florida Su-
preme Court.
I look forward to confirming both of
these impressive nominees, along with
Adrian Zuckerman, the President’s
nominee to serve as our Nation’s Am-
bassador to Romania.
f
THE MIDDLE EAST
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on a final matter, I spoke yesterday
about the courageous people of Hong
Kong who are standing up to Beijing
and speaking up for their freedoms.
But Hongkongers are not alone in
bravely speaking up at this time. The
Middle East continues to be swept by
widespread and cross-sectarian dem-
onstrations.
In Lebanon, in Iraq, and in Iran, mil-
lions are demanding a better future,
greater justice, less corruption, and
more democracy from their govern-
ments. These protests expand three
countries. Each is unique, but one com-
mon thread connects them: Iran.
For years, Iran has systematically
sought to undermine the territorial in-
tegrity and manipulate the politics of
countries all across the Middle East.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in
Lebanon and Iraq, where Iranian prox-
ies have challenged the very sov-
ereignty of the state.
In Lebanon, Iran backs Hezbollah,
the terrorist group that has become a
dominant political player. Hezbollah
has become a state within a state. Its
weapons and fighters do not work to
defend the Lebanese state but to em-
broil it in Syria’s civil war and imperil
its security by threatening Israel with
precision rockets.
In Iraq, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps has spent years sponsoring
Shia militias and proxies that are more
loyal to Tehran than to Baghdad or to
the people of Iraq.
In both of these countries, Tehran
has used and promoted the use of force
to acquire power and to acquire influ-
ence. A few weeks ago, the leader of
Iran’s terrorist Quds Force reportedly
flew to Iraq for secret meetings to
guide Iraqi leaders through the pro-
tests there.
Here is what this Iranian thug told
the Iraqis: ‘‘We in Iran know how to
deal with protests.’’ Enough said.
Well, a violent crackdown on peace-
ful protesters is not going to resolve
anything. What Iraqi and Lebanese
leaders must do is stop listening to the
poisonous advice of Iranian tyrants,
who are losing their own grip on their
own people, and start addressing their
own citizens’ demands for transparency
and reform.
Iraq and Lebanon should give their
people what they want—less corrup-
tion, less malign foreign influence,
more opportunity, and the rule of law.
That is the path forward for Iraq and
Lebanon. Commit to prosperity and
pluralism at home, combat corruption
and injustice within all sects and con-
fessions, protect the sovereignty of
your country, pursue peace with your
neighbors, and enjoy support from the
United States as well.
I would note that in contrast to
Hezbollah’s thugs, Lebanon’s Armed
Forces by most accounts continue to
be one of Lebanon’s few institutions of
national unity. The LAF has respected
the rights of protesters, protected
them from violence, and sought to de-
escalate tensions on the street.
I know the U.S. military believes its
training and partnership with the LAF
is paying off, helping it to be a more
professional and responsible security
force.
So while these events transpire in
Iraq and Lebanon, the Iranian people
themselves are also engaging in their
own demonstrations. Iran used to be a
moderate, open, and prosperous soci-
ety. It could be again. Now tens of
thousands of Iranian people themselves
are raising their voices in righteous
anger at what has become of their liv-
ing conditions and their country. The
Iranian people are feeling the pain in-
flicted by the brutality, selfishness,
and extremism of their ruling class.
The regime seems to be doing all it
can to put a stop to this. Reports over
the weekend indicated an enormous,
unprecedented internet blackout aimed
at keeping Iranians in the dark and
suggests Iranian leaders are threat-
ening yet another violent crackdown
against their own citizens.
But Iran’s leaders know exactly what
must be done to alter the course of
their once-great country and unlock a
better future for its citizens. Iran needs
to stop pursuing nuclear weapons and
long-range missile capabilities, stop
supporting terror and cyber offensives,
stop causing bloodshed to weaken its
neighbors, and stop the horrific mis-
treatment of its own people.
There is an entire civilized world full
of diverse nations that get by just
fine—just fine—without engaging in
any of these rogue state activities. Iran
engages in all of them. Iranian leaders
will either listen to their own citizens
and start behaving like a normal na-
tion or they will be treated more and
more like the backward pariahs they
have become.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

HONG KONG
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
over the past few days and weeks, re-
ports about the democratic protests in
Hong Kong have grown more and more
troubling. The authorities in Hong
Kong have cracked down violently on
some of the protesters, firing hundreds
of rounds of tear gas at a local univer-
sity and even using lethal force in a
few tragic situations. As many have
observed, some of the pictures coming
out of Hong Kong are reminiscent of a
war zone.
Yesterday, the Chinese Communist
Party dealt another blow to Hong
Kong’s special status, criticizing the
ruling by the territory’s High Court
that reversed the Hong Kong Govern-
ment’s ban on masks. The Communist
Party declared that only the Chinese
legislature has the right to decide
whether Hong Kong’s laws are con-
sistent with the Hong Kong basic law
and that no other authority has the
right to make these judgments. That
assertion by the Chinese Communist
Party is a direct assault on Hong
Kong’s judicial independence. Make no
mistake about it, this Communist
Party is cruel and relentless in crack-
ing down on any dissent in every part
of China. What they are doing to the
Uighurs at the other end of the Chinese
country—far away from Hong Kong—is
just brutal and awful.
We in the United States stand in soli-
darity with the democratic protesters,
who have every right to assemble and
petition their government for the
rights of the citizens of Hong Kong.
The administration and the President
himself should voice their support for
the protesters in Hong Kong, which
would send an important message to
the Chinese Communist Party not to
get involved or in any way escalate the
situation. Secretary Pompeo’s call for
calm yesterday is weak tea—not close
to enough. Beyond the Presidential
statement, there are actions we can
take here in Congress because, frankly,
I have been very disappointed that the
President, in this dramatic situation

with Hong Kong, does not do what
Democratic or Republican Presidents
have done in the past in standing up
for human rights and democracy. He
has not done that. He doesn’t seem to
care. As we know, he seems more eager
to please dictators than to please those
who are fighting for democracy.
Congress can act. We have a bipar-
tisan bill in the Senate that has many
cosponsors, including the senior Sen-
ators from Florida and New Jersey and
from Maryland as well, that would re-
affirm our steadfast support for Hong
Kong’s autonomy, democracy, and re-
spect for human rights. It would amend
the Hong Kong Policy Act in order to
give us the tools to safeguard and pro-
tect Hong Kong’s democracy and au-
tonomy and hold accountable those re-
sponsible for the abuse of the human
rights of the people of Hong Kong.
There is no objection to this bill on
the Democratic side of the aisle. We be-
lieve the Senate should pass it. If there
are objections on the Republicans’ side,
let’s take a few days and work through
the bill on the floor. We haven’t done
much legislation. Here is a place at
which we can come together in a bipar-
tisan way. So, if there are no objec-
tions, great. Let’s pass it this after-
noon. I believe the Senator from Flor-
ida will make a unanimous consent re-
quest in that regard. If there are objec-
tions, I urge the Republican leader,
who has spoken out and defended the
protests, to take a few days. Let some-
one try to invoke cloture—it will fail
miserably—and let’s vote on this.
Then, maybe, the House will pass it.
That would be something, I think, that
would happen and with the President
as well.
In addition, the Senator from Or-
egon, along with some others, has a bill
that U.S. companies shouldn’t sell le-
thal types of equipment to the Hong
Kong police that have been used on the
protesters. I would hope we could find
a way to work that proposal into this
bill or, maybe, we could make a unani-
mous consent request alongside it.
Nonetheless, we should pass the bi-
partisan bill in the Senate, reconcile it
with similar legislation in the House,
and quickly send it to the President’s
desk. It would be the strongest action
Congress could take immediately to
demonstrate Americans’ support for
the protests in Hong Kong. It would
send a strong and clear message to the
ruling party in Beijing. It would make
a real difference.
The words on the floor the Repub-
lican leader mentioned yesterday were
good but were not sufficient. Again, I
urge him to move on this legislation, if
we can, by unanimous consent. If not,
let’s have a debate on the floor so the
handful of Senators who might try to
block it are thwarted, and the bill will
move forward.
f
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
this morning, during the House’s im-
peachment inquiry, the American peo-
ple will hear more important testi-
mony from LTC Alexander Vindman, of
the National Security Council, and
from Jennifer Williams, an adviser to
the Vice President.
Regrettably, some Republicans, in-
cluding one in this Chamber, have
tried, without evidence or substan-
tiation, to undermine, to call into
question, and to smear the credibility
of the witnesses, including of Lieuten-
ant Colonel Vindman—a Purple Heart
recipient who has spent his life in serv-
ice to our country. The attacks on the
witnesses are painful and wrong. They
are reminiscent of the actions of a bru-
tal country, not of the democratic Re-
public that we are.
I hope everyone will treat these wit-
nesses with respect and listen to their
testimony with an open mind. Whether
they agree or disagree with their testi-
mony, it is unbecoming of any Senator
to smear these patriots. The House has
a responsibility to seek the truth and
uncover all of the facts, and if it comes
to it, the Senate has a responsibility to
examine the evidence and render im-
partial judgment.
f
INFRASTRUCTURE
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, fi-
nally, on infrastructure, as the im-
peachment inquiry continues, the
Democrats in both Chambers continue
to do the work of the American people.
Just last week, my colleagues in the
House discussed a proposal for a very
significant investment in infrastruc-
ture. At the very beginning of the
Trump administration, the Senate
Democrats proposed a trillion-dollar
infrastructure plan that would create
15 million jobs.
At our meeting at the White House, I
mentioned this to President Trump and
asked him to join us in either sup-
porting our bill or in working to mod-
ify it in a way that he might be able to
support it. At the time, after promising
over and over again in his campaign
that he would pursue a major overhaul
of our Nation’s infrastructure, we had
hoped President Trump would have
worked with us on specific legislation.
Unfortunately and typically, after 3
years into the Trump administration,
instead of working with the Demo-
crats, President Trump has done next
to nothing. Earlier this year, the Presi-
dent walked out of a meeting on infra-
structure that was held between him,
Speaker PELOSI, me, and some other
Congressmen and Senators. We haven’t
heard from him on the issue since.
Meanwhile, Leader MCCONNELL has
turned the Senate into a legislative
graveyard and seems uninterested in
any bipartisan, bicameral legislation.
It is so typical of this administration—
of President Trump. He campaigns on
infrastructure and has commercials
running right now that say the Demo-
crats are not doing anything on infra-
structure when he is the one who is
doing nothing. He has an amazing
penchant for looking at his own faults
and then of pointing the finger at oth-
ers and saying those faults are theirs.
It is glaring on infrastructure.
The idea that the House impeach-
ment inquiry is some sort of distrac-
tion from other issues is plain wrong.
President Trump, we are doing noth-
ing here in the Senate. Come talk to us
about infrastructure, and we can get
something done.
The Democrats in the House and the
Democrats in the Senate are willing to
work with our Republican colleagues
right now. We have over 200 House-
passed bills we could consider here on
the floor and have plenty of bipartisan
Senate bills besides—from bills to
lower the cost of prescription drugs to
election security, to the Violence
Against Women Act. We would like to
work on a large infrastructure bill as
well. It is entirely up to President
Trump and Leader MCCONNELL to de-
cide if we are going to make progress
on a topic like infrastructure or if the
Senate, under MCCONNELL’s leadership,
will continue to be a graveyard for
commonsense ideas to help so many
millions of Americans.

DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS

most fundamental responsibility as
Members of Congress is to provide for

that is ensuring that our men and
women in uniform have the resources

they need to defend our country. That
means, of course, that we have to en-
sure that our military receives ade-
quate funding to meet today’s prior-
ities and to prepare for the threats of
tomorrow. It also means we need to en-
sure that our military receives timely
funding.
Our military doesn’t just need suffi-
cient funding to cover defense prior-
ities; it also needs to receive that
money on time, on a predictable sched-
ule. That means passing the Defense
appropriations bill before the end of
each fiscal year instead of forcing the
military to rely on temporary funding
measures that leave the military in
doubt about funding levels and unable
to start important new projects.
Right now, we are almost 2 full
months into the 2020 fiscal year. We
should have passed the Defense appro-
priations bill by the end of September,
but we didn’t because, unfortunately,
our Democratic colleagues were unable
to resist the chance to pick yet an-
other fight with the President. This
wasn’t supposed to happen. At the end
of the summer, the congressional lead-
ers of both parties and the President
reached an agreement on funding levels
for 2020 and 2021. The leaders also
agreed on a number of guidelines for
appropriations bills, including a ban on
poison pills intended to derail appro-
priations legislation. The idea behind
this agreement was to pave the way for
the timely passage of appropriations
bills and to prevent the kind of situa-
tion we are in right now—almost 2
months behind on passing defense and
other funding. Unfortunately, the
Democrats chose to renege on this
agreement.
The Senate Democrats are currently
holding up defense funding by insisting
on the type of poison pills they prom-
ised to forgo just a few months ago.
The leader has attempted to bring up
the Defense appropriations bill twice,
and both times the Senate Democrats
have filibustered the legislation. It is
deeply disappointing. I understand that
my Democratic colleagues are looking
for any opportunity to pick a fight
with the President, but funding for our
men and women in uniform should not
be subjected to the Democrats’ par-
tisan whims.
Thanks to the Democrats, right now,
our military is operating under a con-
tinuing resolution that leaves the mili-
tary short of the funding it needs for
the 2020 fiscal year. That has real con-
sequences. In addition to leaving the
military underfunded, a continuing res-
olution prevents the military from
starting key projects that will help to
ensure our men and women in uniform
will be prepared to meet the threats of
the future. The Pentagon can’t start
new procurement projects. New re-
search and development initiatives
that keep us a step ahead of our adver-
saries are put on hold. All told, under a
continuing resolution, the military’s
purchasing power is reduced by, rough-
ly, $5 billion each quarter.
To put that in perspective, that is
the equivalent of losing out on about 56
Joint Strike Fighter planes, depending
on the variant, every 3 months. That $5
billion the Pentagon is going without
is urgently needed funding for critical
military priorities. The longer the Pen-
tagon goes without this funding, the
greater the consequences for our mili-
tary preparedness.
Playing politics with our national de-
fense is unacceptable. We owe our men
and women in uniform timely, reliable,
and adequate defense funding, and we
owe every man, woman, and child in
the United States the same thing. The
safety of every person in this country
depends on the strength of our mili-
tary. I hope that at least some of my
Democratic colleagues will see their
way to joining the Republicans in get-
ting this year’s Defense appropriations
bill to the President’s desk. It is time
to get our men and women in uniform
the funding that they need and that
they deserve.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk

E-CIGARETTES
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Sep-
tember 11, President Donald Trump
held a press conference with the First
Lady in the Oval Office. He announced
that his administration would finally
be taking bold action to combat our
Nation’s youth vaping epidemic. The
epidemic is what the Food and Drug
Administration characterized as the
vaping that is going on in schools
across America today—not just high
schools, where 27 percent of the stu-
dents are currently vaping, but middle
schools and grade schools as well.
Seated next to the President on Sep-
tember 11 in the Oval Office was the
First Lady. On the other side was the
Secretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services, Alex Azar. Di-
rectly across from the President was
then-Acting Commissioner of the Food
and Drug Administration, Dr. Ned
Sharpless.
At the press conference, President
Trump stated:
We have a problem in this country . . . and
it is called ‘‘vaping’’—especially vaping as it
pertains to innocent children. . . . And we’re
going to have to do something about it.
Then Secretary Azar said:
An entire generation of children risk be-
coming addicted to nicotine. . . . So with the
President’s support, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration intends to finalize a guidance
document that would . . . require that all
flavors other than tobacco flavor would be
removed from the market.
This would include mint and menthol fla-
voring, as well as candy flavors, bubblegum
flavor, fruit flavor, and alcohol flavor.
Explaining why this action was nec-
essary, the Acting FDA Commissioner,
Dr. Sharpless, said:
Flavored e-cigarette products drive child-
hood use.
Secretary Azar and Acting Commis-
sioner Sharpless committed to final-
izing this guidance, in their own words,
within ‘‘a couple of weeks.’’ Yet here
we are more than 2 months later with
no e-cigarette flavor ban in place.
What is worse, now there are reports
that President Trump has decided to
reverse himself, to break the promise
he made to American families, as a di-
rect result of lobbying from big to-
bacco and big vape companies. We
know whom this President is hearing
from. He is hearing from JUUL, the
company primarily responsible for to-
day’s youth vaping epidemic. He is
hearing from Altria, the big tobacco
company that just bought a major
stake in JUUL. He is hearing from the
Vaping Technology Association, a lob-
bying organization that represents
vaping shops nationwide. It makes
sense that these companies would want
the President to reverse himself, to
break his word to American families,
because they make profits on the backs
of our kids, just like Big Tobacco did
for so many years.
Today, almost 30 percent of all high
school-aged children are vaping. That
is more than 5 million kids. Where did
they come up with these numbers?
From this administration’s report to
the American people. Four percent of
adults are vaping and up to 30 percent
of high school kids. When they show
these pictures of adults walking around
with buttons that say ‘‘We vape and we
vote,’’ it is a tiny sliver of America.
The kids should be wearing buttons
that say ‘‘We vape, and our health is at
risk.’’
Over the last 2 years of Donald
Trump’s Presidency, the number of
children vaping has increased by 135
percent. More than 1 in 4 high school
kids are using e-cigarettes, and more
than 1 in 10 middle school children are
following their example. Kids are using
these products because of the cool,
sleek designs of devices like JUUL and
because of the flavors designed to ap-
peal to just kids. Listen to them: cot-
ton candy, unicorn milk, cool mint,
mom’s sugar cookie, and, of course,
menthol.
According to the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, more than 80 percent of
children who vape started with fla-
vored e-cigarettes. Does anyone believe
that these vaping flavors are actually
intended for a 50-year-old chain smoker
looking to quit cigarettes—flavors like
Farley’s Gnarly Sauce, Bubble Purp by
Chubby Bubble, Blue Razz by Candy
King, and Cotton Candy by Zonk? Do
you honestly think a 50-year-old trying
to break a tobacco cigarette habit is
going to buy Cotton Candy by Zonk
flavoring?
Every single one of these products is
on the market today without review or
authorization from the Food and Drug

Administration. That is because under
President Trump, the FDA decided to
delay regulation of these products for
years. And while the FDA dithers, chil-
dren get addicted. As a result, it is the
Wild Wild West out there with respect
to unapproved, unregulated, dangerous,
and addictive vaping products, and it is
our kids who are paying the price.
Despite what Big Vape says, these
products are not safe. In recent
months, we have seen thousands of ill-
nesses and 42 deaths associated with
vaping, including four in Illinois.
Two weeks ago, a woman came up to
me and said: You don’t know me. I am
a nurse. And she gave me the name of
the hospital. She said: I just want to
tell you, I was there when that 22-year-
old man died last week from vaping. He
had been in our hospital for months
waiting for a lung transplant because
of the damage he had done to his lungs
by vaping. He couldn’t find a donor,
and he died.
There are other known dangers asso-
ciated with e-cigarettes and nicotine.
Nicotine is a toxic, highly addictive
substance that raises blood pressure
and spikes adrenaline, increasing the
risk of heart disease. Nicotine can have
short- and long-term negative health
impacts on the developing brain. Kids
who use e-cigarettes are more likely to
transition to tobacco cigarettes, and
those kill 480,000 Americans each year.
There is hardly a family in this coun-
try who hasn’t been touched by to-
bacco-related death and disease.
A Dartmouth study shows that e-cig-
arette use leads to 81 new smokers for
every 1 smoker who quits. Don’t buy
the pitch from JUUL that you ought to
be vaping so that you can get off of to-
bacco cigarettes. It is running just the
opposite—kids starting on vaping and
converting to tobacco cigarettes.
What do we know about e-cigarettes?
They are predominately used by our
children. Flavors play a major role in
hooking kids on nicotine. Nicotine use
harms the developing brain, and kids
who vape are more likely than their
peers to transition to tobacco ciga-
rettes.
Now let’s consider what we don’t
know about e-cigarettes. We don’t
know whether they are safe. We don’t
know whether they actually help adult
smokers quit. We often don’t know
what the ingredients are in those de-
vices.
E-cigarette flavors need to come off
the market unless or until they can
prove they have a public health ben-
efit—and good luck to that.
The President of the United States,
the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, and the head of the Food and
Drug Administration all told us on
September 11 that they were on the
side of kids and families and public
health, and they promised us they were
going to do something about it. Today,
I am sending the President a letter
asking him to keep his word, to ban e-
cigarette flavors, which threaten our
kids with a lifetime of nicotine addic-
tion, illness, and, sadly, even death.
Along with families nationwide, I am
hoping the President cares more about
children than he does about the lob-
bying pressure from big tobacco and
big vape companies. Just because they
can buy an ad on FOX TV does not
mean they are right.
For goodness’ sake, Mr. President,
stick with your promise of September
11. Protect our kids from this vaping
epidemic.
I ask unanimous consent that my let-
ter to the President be printed in the
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
U.S. SENATE,
Washington, DC, November 19, 2019.
Hon. DONALD J. TRUMP,
President of the United States,
The White House, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: As President of the
United States, you have a responsibility to
put the health and safety of our people—es-
pecially our nation’s children—above all
else. On September 11, 2019, you were poised
to do just that, announcing a long-overdue
plan from the Oval Office to quickly ban all
non-tobacco flavored e-cigarettes, including
flavors such as cotton candy, sugar cookie,
fruit medley, cool mint, and menthol. Sit-
ting alongside the First Lady, Health and
Human Services (HHS) Secretary, and then-
Acting Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
Commissioner, it had all the trappings of a
made-for-television event you seem to relish.
Along with all major public health, edu-
cation, and parent organizations, I praised
this move because e-cigarettes—and their ac-
companying kid-friendly fiavors—are revers-
ing decades of hard-fought progress our na-
tion has made in reducing youth smoking
rates. And now, along with all major public
health, education, and parent organizations,
I have watched in horror over the past two
months as you have seemingly caved to Big
Tobacco and Big Vape lobbying pressure,
breaking your promise to address our na-
tion’s youth vaping epidemic.
Here is what we know about e-cigarettes:
We know that, in the past two years of
your presidency, our nation has experienced
a 135 percent increase in youth use of e-ciga-
rettes.
We know that five million children are now
vaping, including more than one in four
high-school students and more than one in
ten middle-school students.
We know that nearly 30 percent of children
under the age of 18 are now vaping, compared
with less than 4 percent of adults.
We know that JUUL has fueled this youth
public health ‘‘epidemic,’’ as it has been de-
fined by every major federal health official
in your Administration.
We know that e-cigarette flavors—includ-
ing mint and menthol—are why children
first try and become addicted to e-cigarettes.
We know that more than 2,000 Americans
have recently been sickened as a result of
vaping. We also know that, to date, 42 people
have died—including four in my state.
We know that not a single e-cigarette
product available for purchase today is on
the market with authorization from the
FDA.
Finally, we know that your Administra-
tion has completely abdicated its duty to
protect the public health by repeatedly de-
laying and refusing to regulate any of these
dangerous and addictive products.
Here is what we do not know about e-ciga-
rettes:
We do not know the short- or long-term
health impacts of using these products, espe-
cially in children (though we do know that
use of nicotine in the developing brain has
many negative and long-term health con-
sequences).
We do not always know what ingredients—
beyond nicotine—are in e-cigarettes and the
accompanying flavors, nor do we know the
short- or long-term health impact of the use
of those ingredients. We do not if e-ciga-
rettes and flavors actually help adult smok-
ers quit cigarettes (though we do know that
e-cigarette use leads to 80 new smokers for
every one smoker who reports quitting).
We do not conclusively know why so many
people who vape are getting sick and dying.
We do not have answers to these questions
because the tobacco and vaping industries—
shrouded in secrecy and deception—have re-
fused to conduct the much-needed clinical
trials and studies, instead preferring to keep
the health consequences a secret. Perhaps
even more concerning is that your FDA—the
federal agency responsible for regulating to-
bacco products—has not required them to do
so.
More than two months ago, when you an-
nounced the impending e-cigarette flavor
ban, you stated, ‘‘We have a problem in our
country . . . It’s a problem nobody really
thought about too much a few years ago, and
it’s called ‘vaping’—especially vaping as it
pertains to innocent children . . . And we’re
going to have to do something about it . . .
We’re looking at very strong rules and regu-
lations.’’
You further stated, ‘‘Vaping has become a
very big business, as I understand it—like a
giant business in a very short period of time.
But we can’t allow people to get sick, and we
can’t have our youth be so affected.’’
During your September Oval Office press
conference with the First Lady, you made
big promises that you now appear to be
breaking. Children and families nationwide
are still hoping that you will reverse course
and quickly implement an e-cigarette flavor
ban that protects our next generation from a
lifetime of nicotine addiction, illness, and
death.
Sincerely,
RICHARD J. DURBIN,
U.S. Senator.
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thanks
to the Affordable Care Act, 20 million
Americans have health insurance, in-
cluding more than 1 million in my
State of Illinois. Why is it so impor-
tant? Let me tell you the story of
Stefanie from Oak Park, IL. Recently,
Stefanie wrote about her son, who has
a history of mental health and sub-
stance abuse issues. Because of the Af-
fordable Care Act, her son will be able
to stay on her health insurance plan
until he reaches the age of 26.
The Affordable Care Act also re-
quired that all health plans cover men-
tal health and addiction treatment. It
is hard to imagine that people were
selling health insurance in America
that did not cover mental health and
addiction.
Two Senators on the floor of the Sen-
ate—Paul Wellstone, who stood right
over there, and Pete Domenici, who
stood there—teamed up to require that
every health insurance plan in America
cover mental illness. It is so obvious. It
is an issue many families face. But
health insurance plans were excluding
it. Why did these two Senators who
were wildly different politically decide
they would team up for this? Paul

S6636 November 19, 2019
Wellstone had a brother and Senator
Domenici had a son who were strug-
gling with mental illness, and they
didn’t have protection in their health
insurance, so the Senators fought to
include it.
Thank goodness they did. Because of
that health law, insurance companies
cannot discriminate against Stefanie’s
son because of his medical history. Her
son just graduated college. She is
thankful he can stay on her company’s
policy until he gets a job, and she is
thankful her premiums are not higher
due to her son’s health needs. Stefanie
is afraid that if these protections go
away because of a court case that is
currently pending or the actions of the
Republican majority in this Senate,
her son will be uninsurable or face
enormous medical bills that he will be
unable to pay. Stefanie wrote to me,
and she said that if the Affordable Care
Act were to be eliminated, they are
‘‘contemplating leaving this country to
seek manageable health care.’’
Democrats are fighting to keep
healthcare protections for people like
Stefanie and her son. Because of the
Affordable Care Act, people with pre-
existing conditions can no longer be de-
nied coverage or charged higher pre-
miums. Is there anyone among us who
doesn’t know someone with a pre-
existing condition? I have one. This
protects 5 million people in Illinois
who have a preexisting condition.
Insurance companies are no longer
allowed to impose annual or lifetime
caps on benefits or to deny coverage for
mental health, substance abuse treat-
ment, prescription drugs, or hos-
pitalizations, and young people are al-
lowed to stay on their parents’ plan
until they reach age 26.
Despite the Republican and Trump
administration’s continued efforts to
repeal these protections both in Con-
gress and in the courts, health insur-
ance under the Affordable Care Act is
open for business. If you are interested
and want to know the policies avail-
able, healthcare.gov is the website to
visit.
Open enrollment for 2020 health plans
began on November 1 and ends on De-
cember 15. If you can, sign up. It is a
protection that you hope you will
never need, but if you need it, it is
good to have it.

RUSSIA
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, beginning
with Russia’s interference in our 2016
national elections, to the recent with-
drawal of U.S. troops from Syria,
President Trump has made multiple
statements and decisions that serve
only to benefit Vladimir Putin’s agen-
da to undermine democracy and expand
Russia’s influence around the world.
Taken together, these actions aren’t
just a threat to U.S. national security,
but they also undercut and diminish
some of the core tenets and values of
American democracy and global leader-
ship. The U.S. Senate, as part of a co-
equal branch of government, must rec-
ognize this threat and act as a body to
ensure our institutions at home and in-
terests abroad are protected. Thus far,
we have not lived up to this solemn re-
sponsibility.
Let me start with a seminal news ar-
ticle from the Washington Post, just
recently. White House reporter Anne
Gearan, in her October 15, 2019, article,
catalogs how the Trump administra-
tion has allowed Russia to assert domi-
nance globally. The headline reads:
‘‘Trump’s moves in Ukraine and Syria
have a common denominator: Both
help Russia.’’
Anne Gearan writes as follows, and I
will quote in pertinent part.
. . . President Trump has taken action
that has had the effect of helping the author-
itarian leader of Russia.
. . . [The President’s] actions in Syria and
Ukraine add to the list of policy moves and
public statements that have boosted Russia
during his presidency, whether that was
their central purpose or not, confounding
critics who have warned that he has taken
too soft a stance toward a nation led by a
strongman hostile to the United States.
Anne Gearan goes on to discuss how
President Trump’s withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Syria has allowed Russia
to assert a more dominant role in the
region. She also discusses how the
President’s intimidation of Ukraine’s
recently elected President Zelensky
has become the subject of a domestic
impeachment inquiry and distracted
from actual engagement and support to
Ukraine as it continues to grapple with
Russian aggression.
Anne Gearan also notes:
[President] Trump has publicly questioned
the usefulness of NATO—the post-World War
II military alliance established as a bulwark
against first the Soviet Union and now Rus-
sia—as well as the utility of the European
Union, a political and economic alliance
Putin would love to weaken.
This is all written by Anne Gearan.
These actions have led to a growing
consensus among the national security
community that the President is not
serving the national interest. Let me
move to a second part of this.
Sadly, President Trump’s recent ac-
tions with regard to Syria and Ukraine
are, unfortunately, not isolated. Presi-
dent Trump has been consistent in tak-
ing actions that favor Russia. As early
as April of 2016, then-candidate Donald
Trump vowed to pursue closer ties to
Russia if elected to the Presidency.
Even before he took office, by way of
Twitter and other platforms he was
signaling to Vladimir Putin his def-
erence to a Putin-driven U.S.-Russia
dynamic.
From there, the American people
have only learned more about the
Trump campaign’s ties to Russia and
Russia’s interference in the 2016 Presi-
dential election.
The intelligence community’s un-
classified report concluded:
We assess Russian President Vladimir
Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016
aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Rus-
sia’s goals were to undermine public faith in
the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Sec-
retary Clinton, and harm her electability
and potential presidency. We further assess
Putin and the Russian government developed
a clear preference for President-elect Trump.
The interference with our election
process by a hostile government was an
attack on our democracy and a threat
to our national security carried out by
Russian operatives at the direction of
Vladimir Putin himself.
Since Special Counsel Robert
Mueller’s appointment as special coun-
sel to investigate Russia’s attack, 34
indictments have been returned in con-
nection with the investigation, includ-
ing indictments against Russian indi-
viduals and Russian companies, as well
as former Trump campaign manager
Paul Manafort and deputy campaign
manager Rick Gates, who were charged
with ‘‘conspiracy against the United
States.’’ Special Counsel Mueller also
secured guilty pleas from other cam-
paign advisers, including George
Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn.
Despite this ample evidence of
wrongdoing, the President attempted
to impede the Russia probe at every
step of the way. The U.S. intelligence
community, the Senate Intelligence
Committee, and Robert Mueller and his
team of investigators have done a great
service to our Nation in investigating
the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia
and Russian interference in our elec-
tion. The findings further confirm that
President Trump not only benefitted
from Russian interference but, as Anne
Gearan wrote in the October 15 Wash-
ington Post story, President Trump
‘‘has also disputed, at times, the U.S.
intelligence community’s conclusion
that Russia interfered in the 2016 elec-
tion to boost his candidacy, and he
only reluctantly signed a bill imposing
sanctions on Russia for the trans-
gression after weeks of resisting the
measure, which he called, ‘seriously
flawed.’’’
Anne Gearan is referencing the Coun-
tering America’s Adversaries Through
Sanctions Act, known by the acronym
CAATSA, or C-A-A-T-S-A. That is leg-
islation that I supported, and it passed
both Houses of Congress with bipar-
tisan support to impose sanctions on
U.S. adversaries, including Russia, for
its incursions into Ukraine and Syria
and interference in our elections.
I believe it is likely that if CAATSA
did not clearly prohibit it, President
Trump would have removed preexisting
Russia sanctions by now.
So the evidence is clear. By inter-
fering in our national elections and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6637
November 19, 2019
elevating Donald Trump’s prospects for
success as a candidate, Vladimir Putin
was assuring that a personal ally would
be installed in the White House and
that that particular ally would clear
the way for Putin to advance his for-
eign policy goals around the world.
Let me move to a second—or, I
should say, a third—part of this. If it
isn’t bad enough that the President is
himself undermining our intelligence
community’s findings, he has deployed
Attorney General William Barr to try
and discredit those findings—those
findings by our intelligence commu-
nity with regard to interactions with
allies.
William Barr has been traveling the
world chasing conspiracy theories and
investigating President Trump’s com-
plaints about the origins of the govern-
ment’s investigation into Russian elec-
tion interference. Specifically, the At-
torney General is examining whether
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement
agencies acted properly when they ex-
amined possible ties between the
Trump campaign and Russia, which ul-
timately led to Special Counsel
Mueller’s investigation. We have
learned that this probe is now a crimi-
nal investigation, suggesting that it is
focused on the unfounded allegations
pushed by the President’s allies about
how the Russia probe was started.
Considering that Special Counsel
Mueller, the intelligence community,
and the bipartisan Senate Intelligence
Committee all confirmed in great de-
tail that Russia interfered in the 2016
election, it is entirely unclear what
legal or factual predicate Attorney
General Barr is even relying on to jus-
tify this criminal investigation into
the origins of the government’s inves-
tigation into Russia’s election inter-
ference.
Attorney General Barr is pursuing
these efforts, despite the fact that
Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte
stated that Italy’s intelligence services
played no role in the Russian inves-
tigation. It appears that Attorney Gen-
eral Barr is using the Justice Depart-
ment to chase unsubstantiated con-
spiracy theories that could benefit the
President politically and also under-
mine Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s
Russia investigation.
The Attorney General has also dem-
onstrated eagerness to prejudge his
own investigation by already telling
lawmakers in April that he believed
that ‘‘spying did occur’’ by the FBI on
the Trump campaign. So the President
has dispatched a top U.S. law enforce-
ment official around the world to pur-
sue a biased investigation into an ef-
fort to undermine our intelligence
agencies and to undermine the work of
a special counsel who was appointed by
the very same Justice Department that
Attorney General Barr leads, with the
primary goal—the primary goal—being
to clear Vladimir Putin’s government
of wrongdoing. It is hard to com-
prehend or adequately articulate how
disturbing that is.
Let me move to another part of the
evidence with regard to how the Presi-
dent deals with President Putin and his
government—the Helsinki summit.
President Trump’s dangerous deference
to Vladimir Putin was most evident at
the July 2018 summit in Helsinki.
Putin and President Trump had a 2-
hour one-on-one meeting, followed by
an unprecedented press conference.
President Trump appears to over-
whelmingly favor one-on-one, closed-
door, direct communications with
Putin on a regular basis. I have to ask
at least two questions, among many we
could ask. Question No. 1 is, What is he
hiding? No. 2 is, Why not have experi-
enced U.S. personnel present at such
bilateral meetings?
Even more disturbing were the Presi-
dent’s statements following the
Trump-Putin meeting. Here is a brief
summary of what happened at that
meeting:
President Trump praised Putin and
his leadership.
No. 2, he repeatedly sided with Putin
over our intelligence community, as-
serting that Russia did not, in fact,
interfere in the 2016 elections. The
President repeatedly siding with Putin
over our intelligence community was a
grave offense by the President that
made our Nation less safe—in my judg-
ment, for sure less safe. It was one of
the worst moments in any American
Presidency.
No. 3 in my brief summary of that
public meeting in Helsinki is that Mr.
Putin was silent the whole time when
this was happening.
President Trump’s rambling com-
ments over several minutes reflect not
only the President’s disturbing desire
to flatter and to show support for
Putin but also his complete failure—in
that instance, his complete failure—to
advance U.S. interests.
Let me move to the impeachment
that is underway regarding Ukraine.
The transcript of the now-infamous
July 25 phone call with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky that is
the subject of the current impeach-
ment inquiry also reflects the Presi-
dent’s failure to prioritize U.S. na-
tional security interests when it comes
to Russia.
Going back to Anne Gearan and the
Washington Post story of October 15 of
this year, she wrote: ‘‘During that call,
Trump did not mention longstanding
U.S. policy goals for Ukraine, including
standing up to Russian pressure, and he
may have tarred and weakened
Zelensky and his winning anti-corrup-
tion platform by dragging him into do-
mestic U.S. politics.’’
Such major omissions send a clear
signal to Putin that he could expand
his aggression in Ukraine beyond Cri-
mea and to the Ukrainian people and
also the message to the Ukrainian peo-
ple that Zelensky is not going to be the
strong leader with U.S. backing that
Ukraine needs at this time.
We have already seen the impact of
President Trump’s abandonment of
Ukraine amid this impeachment scan-
dal. In early October, President
Zelensky was effectively backed into a
corner to sign Ukraine on to the so-
called Steinmeier Formula, which sets
the path toward elections in the
Donbass region of eastern Ukraine and
eventual negotiations with Russia over
the future of Russian-occupied terri-
tories. He did this without achieving
previously imposed preconditions of
Russian troop withdrawal and security
for the elections.
Zelensky was effectively shamed into
pursuing this Steinmeier Formula
after President Trump urged him to ne-
gotiate with Putin—with Putin—sev-
eral times on camera during the United
Nations General Assembly meetings in
September. As Anne Gearan puts it,
‘‘The result: A country that was look-
ing for strong U.S. backing, amid wor-
ries that Russia could seek to move its
aggression beyond the annexation of
Crimea, has been left to wonder about
the Trump administration’s commit-
ment to its national interests.’’
Let me move to Syria. President
Trump’s latest moves in Syria only
further amplify the alarm over this
President’s affinity for Vladimir Putin.
In early October, President Trump
announced the abrupt withdrawal of
U.S. troops from Syria, clearing the
way for Turkey to pursue a military
operation against Kurdish allies of the
United States in northern Syria. Fol-
lowing an initial U.S.-brokered
ceasefire, Turkish and Russian authori-
ties have agreed to a more permanent
status, sharing control of Syria’s
northern border.
Turkish and Russian forces are not
only occupying Kurdish-held areas but
also further expanding Russia’s role in
Syria and committing war crimes
against Kurdish civilians, according to
the United Nations.
Russia has already occupied U.S.
military camps in the region, and
Turkish President Erdogan’s deepening
relationship with Vladimir Putin—as
evidenced by Turkey’s purchase of the
Russian S–400 missile system—only un-
dercuts U.S. influence in Syria, all but
guaranteeing that U.S. interests will
not be represented in a future Syrian
political settlement.
President Trump’s decision serves to
benefit Vladimir Putin. Prior to with-
drawal, the United States was Russia’s
only military equal in Syria, but Rus-
sia is now the primary and, according
to some analysts, the sole power
broker in Syria.
In the vacuum left by the United
States, Putin will be able to return
control of the country to Bashar al-
Assad, exercise increased control over
Turkey—a NATO ally—and return to
Russia’s Cold War-era dominance in
the Middle East.
As Georgetown University Russia
specialist Andrew Bennett put it,
‘‘[W]hat is clear is that Russia and the
[Bashar al-] Assad regime that it backs
have been the big winners in Trump’s
abrupt retreat. . . . Now, suddenly

Putin is back in the driver’s seat in
Syria, with leverage over all sides.’’
Mr. President, it is even worse than
that. Let me recount some recent news
with regard to actions by Vladimir
Putin.
President Trump’s transgression goes
beyond simply allowing Russia to fill a
vacuum. On October 13, just 2 days be-
fore Anne Gearan’s Washington Post
story, the New York Times reported
that ‘‘the Russian Air Force has re-
peatedly bombed hospitals in Syria in
order to crush the last pockets of re-
sistance to President Bashar al-Assad.’’
The Times published evidence in that
story that the Russians bombed four
Syrian hospitals in a 12-hour period in
May of this year. During the assault,
the Kafr Nabl Surgical Hospital in Idlib
Province was struck four times in 30
minutes. Let me say that again. A hos-
pital was struck four times in 30 min-
utes. Dozens of hospitals and clinics in
Idlib Province have been struck since,
and Syrian medical workers live in
constant fear of the next strike.
Russia continues to act with impu-
nity. Not only did it bomb another hos-
pital in Idlib last week, Russia is using
its sway at the United Nations Secu-
rity Council—where U.S. leadership has
diminished significantly under this ad-
ministration—to limit the scope and
the impact of a U.N. inquiry into these
bombings.
Such atrocities go beyond the pale of
violating the Geneva Conventions and
the laws of war; they demonstrate just
how ruthless Putin and his regime are
and the lengths they are willing to go
to assert Russia’s influence in the Mid-
dle East. The tragedy is, this adminis-
tration is allowing it to happen. Under
this administration, we have seen U.S.
leadership erode and multilateral insti-
tutions deteriorate to the point where
the U.N. is powerless to hold Russia ac-
countable for these atrocities.
I cannot emphasize enough that this
administration is not only failing the
American people with regard to our re-
lationship with Russia and national se-
curity interests, but it is also making
us less safe by allowing unspeakable
atrocities to occur against innocent ci-
vilians—all on our watch.
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. President, I will be brief because
I know I only have about 5 minutes be-
fore we have to move on, but I want to
turn to some brief comments about the
courageous public servants whom we
have watched and will continue to
watch testify before the House Intel-
ligence Committee both last week and
again this week in the impeachment
inquiry.
We have heard from George Kent,
Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador
Yovanovitch, and today, Lieutenant
Colonel Vindman and others, and my
remarks go out to do justice to all
those who will testify for their cour-
age. I want to make some brief com-
ments.
These individuals and so many others
are putting their careers and reputa-
tions on the line to testify publicly in
defense of U.S. national security,
moral leadership, and our democratic
institutions. It is outrageous—and that
is an understatement—that they have
been subjected to partisan attacks—
public servants who have sacrificed so
much for our Nation. In the case of the
diplomats, the diplomats have been at-
tacked without any support or defense
from Secretary of State Pompeo or
other senior Department of State offi-
cials.
We should all be inspired by these
and countless other public servants
who work to protect and serve the
United States every day. When I reflect
upon their service to our country and
their integrity, I am reminded of just
one line from ‘‘America the Beautiful:
‘‘O beautiful for patriot dream, That
sees beyond the years.’’ One of the
dreams of a patriot, of course, is to see
beyond our own circumstances, to
dream about a better future by uphold-
ing our institutions and by serving the
rule of law, our democracy, and our
Constitution.
I will skip over all of the information
we already know about the service of
these Ambassadors and just conclude
with some comments about what hap-
pened today.
Today, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman,
before questioning by the committee
Members, was going through his expe-
rience. I will go through it briefly: in-
fantry officer, foreign area officer spe-
cializing in European and Eurasian po-
litical military affairs, political mili-
tary affairs officer, serving on the Na-
tional Security Council, and serving
our country in combat and paying the
price of being wounded in combat.
At the end of his statement today,
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman talked
about his father. He said:
His courageous decision [to come to this
country] inspired a deep sense of gratitude in
my brothers and myself and instilled in us a
sense of duty and service. All three of us
served or are currently serving in the mili-
tary. Our collective military service is a spe-
cial part of our family’s story in America.
He went on to say:
I am grateful for my father’s brave act of
hope 40 years ago and for the privilege of
being an American citizen and public serv-
ant, where I can live free of fear for mine and
my family’s safety.
He contrasted that with what hap-
pens in Russia. I think it is a good re-
minder for all of us.
Let me conclude with these thoughts.
It is appalling to see individuals such
as Lieutenant Colonel Vindman who
dedicated their entire lives to the safe-
ty and security of the United States be
smeared by the President and by his
attack dogs who are more concerned
about tweets and FOX News headlines
than protecting our Nation’s domestic
foundations.
Nothing the President has said or
done in his nearly 3 years as President
convinces me he has any understanding
of public service. Looking beyond the
current impeachment inquiry, this ad-
ministration’s blatant disregard and
disrespect for career diplomats has had
a grave impact on the State Depart-
ment and our National Security Agen-
cy’s ability to recruit the next genera-
tion of talented, committed public
servants who promote U.S. interests
abroad.
I will not allow this administration’s
continuing assault on our diplomats to
undermine, devalue, or dishonor their
service or the service of future patriots
who choose to make a career of serving
and protecting our Nation.
The Ambassadors and officials who
testified last week, as well as today—
others, including Lieutenant Colonel
Vindman—have lived honorable and du-
tiful lives in service to the United
States of America. We owe them our
deepest gratitude and appreciation for
their integrity and commitment to
American values. These are real Amer-
ican heroes who, despite the Presi-
dent’s bullying and harassment, have
stood up in defense of our democratic
institutions and the values the Found-
ers fought for to guide our Nation.

have come to the floor to talk about
the wind production tax credit. This is
a subject that I’ve talked about before.
The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr.
TOOMEY, will, I believe, come soon to
talk on the same subject.
The wind production tax credit is so
generous with taxpayers’ money that
wind developers can actually give away
their electricity for free and still make
a profit. Let me say that again. I am
talking today about the wind produc-
tion tax credit, which is a tax sub-
sidy—taxpayer dollars—given to wind
developers, and it is so generous that
the developers can actually, in some
cases, give away their electricity for
free and still make a profit.
That wind production tax credit has
been extended 11 times. It has been on
the books for more than 25 years. This
was a tax credit that was supposed to
jump-start a new industry—that’s 25
years of jump-starting. Four years ago,
Congress agreed to end it. We thought
that was it. In doing so, Congress asked
taxpayers to provide another $24 bil-
lion, according to the Joint Committee
on Taxation, to extend the wind pro-
duction tax credit—$24 billion more in
subsidies for another 5 years and
gradually phase out the credit. That is
what we thought we did 4 years ago. We
would spend $24 billion more in ex-
change for phasing out and ending the
wind production tax credit. This is on
top of the nearly $10 billion taxpayers
paid between 2008 and 2015 and the bil-
lions more the taxpayers have paid
since the wind production tax credit
was created in 1992. That was supposed
to be the end of the wind production
tax credit 4 years ago. Remember, it

was supposed to jump-start a new in-
dustry. President Obama’s Energy Sec-
retary said years ago that wind is al-
ready a mature industry. That was dur-
ing the Obama administration.
Now some Members of Congress are
trying to break the agreement of 4
years ago to end the wind production
tax credit. Earlier this summer, the
House Ways and Means Committee re-
ported legislation that extends that
credit through the end of 2020. This
huge amount of money is not the only
thing wrong with that proposal.
First, the wind production tax credit
undercuts reliable electricity like nu-
clear power. This is called negative
pricing, which is when wind developers
have such a big subsidy that they can
give away their electricity and still
make money. If you are a wind devel-
oper, for every kilowatt hour of elec-
tricity one of these 40-story-high wind
structures produces, the taxpayers will
pay you up to 2.3 cents, which in some
markets is more than the cost of the
wholesale value of each kilowatt hour
of electricity. Negative pricing such as
this distorts the marketplace. It puts
at risk more reliable forms of energy
such as nuclear power, which produces
60 percent of all the carbon-free elec-
tricity in the United States. In con-
trast, wind produces about 19 percent
of all the carbon-free electricity in the
United States. I think it is important
to produce carbon-free electricity. I be-
lieve climate change is a problem and
that humans are a cause of the prob-
lem.
Why would we undercut the produc-
tion of nuclear power—which is 60 per-
cent of our carbon-free electricity—by
the negative pricing of this big, expen-
sive wind production tax credit? With
nuclear power available, expecting a
country the size of the United States
to operate on windmills is the energy
equivalent of going to war in sail
boats.
Second, in my view, windmills de-
stroy the environment rather than
save it. You could run these 40-story
structures from Georgia to Maine to
produce electricity, scarring the entire
eastern landscape or you could produce
the same amount of electricity with
eight nuclear power plants. If you did
run these giant structures from Geor-
gia to Maine, you would still need nat-
ural gas or nuclear power to produce
electricity when the wind is not blow-
ing, which is most of the time.
There is a much better way to spend
the dollars that are available for clean
energy. Instead of subsidizing wind de-
velopers, the United States could use
that money to double the nearly $6.6
billion that the Federal Government
spends on basic energy research to
make truly bold breakthroughs that
will help us provide cleaner, cheaper
energy and raise family incomes.
Earlier this year, I came to the Sen-
ate floor and called for a New Manhat-
tan Project for Clean Energy, a 5-year
project with 10 grand challenges that
will use American research and tech-
nology to put our country and the
world firmly on a path toward cleaner,
cheaper energy. Specifically, I encour-
aged funding breakthroughs in ad-
vanced nuclear reactors, natural gas,
carbon capture, better batteries,
greener buildings, electric vehicles,
cheaper solar, fusion, advanced com-
puting, and doubling energy research
funding. All of that is a better use of
funding than more funding for wind de-
velopers, which is so generous that in
some cases they can give away their
electricity and still make a profit. Let
wind energy go where we said it should
go in 2015; let it go unsubsidized into
the free market. That is where we
thought we sent it 4 years ago, and
that is where it should go.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want
to join my colleague from Tennessee in
explaining why we ought to allow this
deal to stand—the deal that was struck
some years ago to phase out these in-
credibly inefficient subsidies.
I thank my colleague from Tennessee
for his leadership on this issue. As you
know, this is a very large tax subsidy.
The government is already set to spend
about $67 billion in energy tax sub-
sidies just over the next 5 years, and
we should be very clear about this:
These subsidies lead to a lower stand-
ard of living. When we choose to take
an inefficient form of energy and throw
a lot of money at it, it just lowers the
standard of living. We have less re-
sources available for all the other
things we could be doing with that
money.
As my colleague from Tennessee
mentioned, the wind production tax
credit began in 1992 for the very
straightforward, simple reason that it
couldn’t compete. It is completely eco-
nomically uncompetitive. The idea is,
we will have this temporary subsidy to
enable the wind production to reach an
economy of scale, reach a maturity in
the industry that would allow it to
compete, and the consensus at the time
was that ought to be achieved by about
1999. After about 7 years of taxpayer
subsidies, the industry should be on its
feet, should be competitive, and there
would be technological improvements
and everything would be fine. That was
20 years ago. We have been subsidizing
it ever since.
We extended this program 11 times.
The wind component of all of our en-
ergy subsidies is about $25 billion over
a 5-year period, and they still can’t
compete. The reason it can’t compete
is because it is just extremely expen-
sive to build the electricity-generating
capacity if it is a windmill. It is much
more expensive than alternative forms
of energy. The cost of building wind ca-
pacity versus natural gas, for instance,
is pretty stark. It costs less than $1,000
per kilowatt of capacity for a natural
gas-fired powerplant. It costs over
$1,600 per kilowatt for wind production.
Obviously, after the production is
done, windmills don’t require ongoing
fuel. Amazingly enough, that savings is
not enough to ever recoup the huge
amount of capital you have to lay out
upfront to build this very, very expen-
sive technology. You don’t have to
take my word for it. Warren Buffett
had something to say about this. He
knows something about investments.
He knows something about economic
efficiency. Warren Buffett said:
We get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind
farms. That is the only reason to build them.
They don’t make sense without the tax cred-
it.
That is the reality we have. It is
compounded by the fact, of course, that
wind energy is inherently unreliable.
This will come as no surprise to my
colleagues. You don’t generate elec-
tricity from a windmill unless the wind
is blowing. Unfortunately, it is just a
fact of nature that wind generation
tends to peak in the middle of the
night and early morning hours when
our energy needs are at their lowest.
It is very hard to store electricity, so
we end up with this bizarre situation
that the Senator from Tennessee al-
luded to, where sometimes the wind
farms are generating tremendous
amounts of electricity, when no one
needs electricity, because there is a
wind storm in the middle of the night,
but because they are so heavily sub-
sidized by taxpayers, the wind farm
companies are willing to pay the elec-
tric grid operator to take their elec-
tricity. Normally, you sell your elec-
tricity. They actually will pay money
to have the electrical grid take their
electricity. This is extremely disrup-
tive for the conventional sources of
electricity, whether it is nuclear or gas
or coal, because they have to be there
all the time to adjust for the wild fluc-
tuations that come from wind-gen-
erated electricity. It is very hard for
them to have a vehicle business model
when occasionally the product they
produce has a negative value. It is just
bizarre.
I want to stress another element of
this, which is the original rationale.
The original rationale was that this
was a new industry. It was going to
need some help getting on its feet and
getting established, and after some pe-
riod of time, it would be able to com-
pete on its own. This is no longer even
remotely the case. In fact, there is a
tremendous amount of wind-generated
electricity in America because these
subsidies have been so big for so long.
In 1999, we had only 41⁄2 billion kilo-
watt hours of electricity generated
from wind. In 2018, we had 275 billion
kilowatt hours—a 6,000-percent in-
crease in two decades. It is now 7 per-
cent of all U.S. electricity generation
because these subsidies are so expen-
sive.
I think it was, in part, because of the
enormous growth of this industry and
the maturity of it—the decades-long
history—that Congress finally decided
back in 2015 that we would phase out
these subsidies. We wouldn’t do it im-
mediately, but we would phase them

out by 2019. So 20 years after the sub-
sidies were supposed to end, we are now
on a glide path to phasing this out and
having these taxpayer subsidies expire
at the end of this year.
At the time the Wind Energy Asso-
ciation looked at this in 2015, they
said: ‘‘Growth in the wind industry is
expected to remain strong when the
PTC is fully phased out.’’ PTC is the
production tax credit. That is what we
are talking about. Lo and behold, we
get to the end of 2019, or nearly so, and,
sure enough, some folks in Congress
are saying: Well, let’s not stick to that
deal. Let’s continue this subsidy even
longer. So we had a markup in the
Ways and Means Committee of the
other Chamber to add yet another
year’s extension to the wind tax credit
that will cost another $2 billion.
I just don’t think we should break
the deal that we had in 2015. This is an
inefficient use of taxpayers’ money.
This makes our economy less efficient.
This lowers our standard of living and
is disruptive to the ongoing base
sources of electricity that we need
across the country.
The last point I want to make is that
it is not as though we have an energy
shortage in this country. It is not as
though we are going to have to turn to
hostile foreign sources to get the en-
ergy to replace if we don’t continue
heavily subsidizing wind production.
The fact is we have staggering amounts
of natural gas—enough natural gas to
serve our electricity generation needs
for the indefinite future. In 2017, the
United States became a net exporter of
natural gas. It is a huge, growing
source of electricity generation that is
clean, that is reliable, and that is in-
credibly abundant. We came to the
right conclusion some years ago. Now
is our opportunity to stick to it.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRUZ). The Senator from Texas.
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, history
has taught us that the closer you get
to election day, the harder it gets to
pass legislation here in the Congress. It
is hard, anyway, by design. You have to
pass a bill through committees in the
House and in the Senate. Both bodies
have to pass a bill if they are different.
They have to reconcile those in a con-
ference committee. Then, you have to
negotiate with the White House in
order to get the President’s signature.
So, by design, it is hard to pass legisla-
tion, but it shouldn’t be this hard.
With less than a year to go before the
2020 election, we are racing against the
clock. We started this year with bipar-
tisan ambitions to address healthcare
costs, to bolster international trade,
and to get the appropriations process
back on track and avoid unnecessary
government shutdowns. Yet, some-
where along the way, politics hijacked
the process.
Our colleagues across the aisle de-
cided that no matter how critical legis-
lation may be, foiling President Trump
was even more important. They are so
outraged by the President and so con-
sumed by his every word and every
tweet that they have brought the work
of this body to a screeching halt in an
effort to remove him from office less
than a year before the next general
election. It seems they have no desire
whatsoever to pass legislation that
would benefit the American people, let
alone any urgency to get things mov-
ing. The only thing our Democratic
colleagues seem to care about is stop-
ping the President from getting any-
thing that could be construed as a win.
Over in the House, the Democrats
have put legislating on the back burner
and are spending their days trying to
nullify the results of the 2016 election.
They are slow-walking negotiations on
the National Defense Authorization
Act, which has passed every year with-
out fail since 1961. Their negotiations
with the administration over the
USMCA—that is the successor to
NAFTA, which helped to benefit the
employment of roughly 13 million
Americans—have kept farmers, ranch-
ers, and manufacturers in limbo for
months. Along with the necessary
funding to help to make up for the lack
of funds in the highway trust fund,
they have also complicated efforts to
get a long-term highway bill reauthor-
ization passed.
Despite the partisan frenzy in the
House, I have always believed the Sen-
ate should do its best to stay above the
fray, but the minority leader has prov-
en me wrong. In fact, last week, I came
to the floor to ask unanimous consent
to pass a bill that Senator RICHARD
BLUMENTHAL, of Connecticut, a Demo-
crat, and I, a Republican, introduced
together. Incredibly, this bill passed
unanimously out of the Committee on
the Judiciary.
Our legislation is designed to do what
all here in Washington say they want
to do, which is to reduce drug prices—
in this case, by stopping drug makers
from gaming the patent system. Our
bill strikes a delicate balance of pro-
tecting innovation, which is very, very
important—we must not lose sight of
that—while it increases competition,
and you know competition helps to
bring down prices. As an added bonus,
it would lower Federal spending by
more than a half a billion dollars over
10 years. That is not even talking
about what it would do in the non-
governmental sector for savings.
Senator BLUMENTHAL and I have done
what you are expected to do here in a
legislative body, which is to work hard
to build consensus and come up with a
bill that could gain bipartisan support.
By any measure, we have succeeded in
doing that, as it has a dozen bipartisan
cosponsors. As I mentioned, when this
legislation was reviewed by the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary—a committee
that, notably, can be pretty conten-
tious at times—the committee passed
it unanimously. Every Republican and
every Democrat voted for it.
I had hoped that would have been
some indication that this bill would
have quickly passed the full Senate
when brought to the Senate floor. Ap-
parently, the minority leader, the Sen-
ator from New York, had other plans in
mind, because when I, along with Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL, came to the floor
last week to try to get this legislation
passed, he objected—hence, the Schu-
mer graveyard.
On November 18, 2019, when referring
to S. 1416, regarding the lowering of
drug prices, Senator SCHUMER said:
‘‘Democrats are happy and eager to
work on those issues.’’
One thing I have learned around here
is that it is not just what people say
but what they do that counts, and he
objected to this virtually unanimously
supported bill, on a bipartisan basis, to
lower drug prices. He actually called it
a good bill. He said it was well-inten-
tioned, but he said there were other
ideas that had to be included before he
would lift his objection. So he doesn’t
have any objection to our bill. He un-
derstands it is a good bill but that it
may not be as comprehensive as he
would like.
Another thing I have learned in my
time in the Senate is that if you de-
mand everything and are not willing to
compromise, you are going to end up
with nothing. Apparently, that is what
the Democratic leader is happy with,
including for his constituents in New
York, by the way, who will have to pay
more money out-of-pocket as a result
of his objection to this commonsense
bill.
I would hope that he would talk to
his own Members who have cospon-
sored this bill. Most notably, the
Democratic whip, Senator DURBIN, of
Illinois, has cosponsored the bill as
well as Senator MURRAY, of Wash-
ington, who is the ranking member on
the Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions. They are both co-
sponsors of this bill that the Demo-
cratic leader objected to.
While all Senators have said they
want to address rising drug prices, Sen-
ator SCHUMER has the distinction of
being the only Senator to have actu-
ally blocked a bill that would do ex-
actly that. Why would he do that? He
claims—I think, mistakenly so—that
passing my bill would somehow render
the Senate incapable of passing any
other drug pricing legislation. That is,
obviously, ridiculous and untrue.
I happen to sit not only on the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary but on the
Committee on Finance. There is a sig-
nificant bipartisan Committee on Fi-
nance bill, together with the Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee’s bill, that has been produced by
Senator ALEXANDER and Senator MUR-
RAY. Both of those contain many good
ideas. I wish we had the time and the
bandwidth to debate and vote on those
on the Senate floor and in the House.
But for the fact that our House col-
leagues are so obsessed with impeach-
ment and seem incapable of doing any-
thing else, I think we could do that.
Of course, even though the Demo-
cratic leader himself is the reason this

bill did not pass last week, it hasn’t
stopped him from complaining about
the lack of progress on other legisla-
tion. Yesterday evening, for example,
he came to the floor and said: ‘‘Demo-
crats are happy and eager to work on
those issues.’’ I would suggest, when he
says they ‘‘are happy and eager to
work on those issues,’’ that it is just
happy talk, not our actually rolling up
our sleeves and working together to
get the work of the American people
done, which is the reason I thought we
were here.
The Democratic leader went on to
say that the Senate Democrats are
waiting with bated breath for the Re-
publican leader to put any of these
bills on the floor and for any Repub-
lican to speak out and demand they go
on the floor. Yet, when I asked for this
bill to be passed on the floor, it was not
a Republican who blocked it. It was the
same person who said he would be
happy and eager to work on those
issues. Again, what people say in Wash-
ington, DC, is not what they actually
do sometimes. I suggest it is important
to see what people do, not just listen to
what they say.
Sadly, this isn’t the only time the
Democratic leader has blocked
progress on bipartisan priorities. It is
just the latest. Here are some other
tombstones in the Schumer graveyard.
Over the summer, our colleagues on
the Committee on Appropriations had
the foresight to prepare for the funding
fight that we expected this fall. That
was a normal part of the process. They
negotiated a spending caps agreement
to make the appropriations process
much more straightforward in both
Chambers of Congress, and the House
and the Senate approved the terms. We
agreed to that top-line funding level
both for defense and nondefense spend-
ing. There was also a promise not to
derail the process with poison pills in
the form of policy riders. We got all of
it done with plenty of time to spare.
After we voted on that, there was
reason for hope and optimism in that,
somehow, we had made it much easier
for us to do the Nation’s business when
it had come to the spending bills. While
there was still a lot of work to do, we
thought this put us on a strong footing
to get funding bills passed before the
end of the fiscal year. Yet here we are
today, on November 19—a long time
from those votes in August—and we
still don’t have those spending bills
passed.
Our Democratic colleagues have, on
two instances, actually objected to
even debating the Defense appropria-
tions bill, which provides a pay raise
for our troops. They will not even talk
about it. They will not offer amend-
ments. They just blocked it. They just
stopped it dead in its tracks. You
would have thought everybody would
have learned not to play politics with
the appropriations bills. Our Demo-
cratic colleagues have held up govern-
ment funding due to a disagreement
that is equal to about 0.3 percent of the
discretionary spending budget, and
they are trying to reopen the very
budget agreement that they agreed to
last summer that has become law.
They blocked vital education fund-
ing, which would have provided more
than $71 billion to the Department of
Education. This spending bill would
bolster a number of the grant programs
that our students and our schools rely
on, and it would promote college access
and affordability to help more prospec-
tive college students. That same fund-
ing bill would have invested nearly $4
billion in our fight against the opioid
epidemic, supported workforce training
programs, and strengthened our na-
tionwide mental health system.
Could the majority leader put aside
politics just long enough to let this
funding bill, which would do so much
good, pass? Well, apparently not.
If you think that is bad, it just gets
worse. Our most fundamental responsi-
bility in Congress is to provide for the
common defense. Before we can worry
about anything else, we need the safety
and security that our military provides
to fight, if necessary, our Nation’s wars
and to defend our democracy. Actually,
the strength of our military is directly
related to our ability to live in peace
because when our adversaries see us as
tentative or weak or withdrawing or
unwilling to fund our military training
and readiness, they view that as a sign
of weakness, which itself can be a prov-
ocation, which, again, ignores our most
basic job as Members of the Congress.
There have always been disagree-
ments about exact dollar figures; we
are not talking about that. But the
top-line figures were agreed upon last
summer, so I thought we were ready to
fund our military on time.
Well, shame on me for being an opti-
mist or at least optimistic enough to
believe that people would keep their
commitments, keep their word, and we
would somehow head down this path to
funding the U.S. Government.
Here we are, with one continuing res-
olution expiring in 3 days’ time. I be-
lieve the House will vote on an addi-
tional continuing resolution that will
take us to December 20, and then the
Senate will have to do that just to
keep the lights on here in Washington,
DC—just to make sure that govern-
ment actually functions.
None of this is necessary, and all of it
is directly related to hyperpartisan
conflict, which we all understand, but
it simply is getting in the way of our
ability to do our business.
The one that strikes me as the most
indefensible, beyond the prescription
drug objection, is blocking funding for
our troops. We depend on an all-volun-
teer military, and obviously many of
our military members are not just sin-
gle; they have families who depend on
them and on the funding that Congress
provides. But our colleagues blocked it
two different times—again, voting
against the motion to proceed to the
bill which, in plain English, is just say-
ing that they didn’t even want to start
talking about or amending the under-
lying bill, which each Senator would
have the opportunity to do if they
would allow us to begin that process,
which they blocked.
Well, the Democratic leader loves to
talk about the legislative graveyard
here in the Senate. What he really
means is that he wants to control the
agenda, even in his seat as the minor-
ity leader. Well, he knows the rules of
the Senate don’t permit the minority
to control the agenda. That is why it is
so important that Senator MCCONNELL
is where he is and that Republicans
have a majority.
We are not saying that you have to
do it our way or the highway. We are
saying: Let’s engage in the legislative
process. Let’s take up legislation on
the floor of the Senate and let Senators
offer their amendments, their sugges-
tions, and then let’s vote on them. But
let’s not just stop things dead in their
tracks because of partisan politics or
because somebody doesn’t want some-
body who happens to be on the ballot
in 2020 to get a ‘‘win.’’ That is really
beneath the dignity of the Senate or
any Senator. It is less than what the
American people have a right to expect
of us.
I would ask the Democratic leader
again: Please don’t head down this
path by creating a graveyard of your
own for bipartisan legislation that
could and should become law. It is not
my way or the highway. We have to
work on this together, and we are will-
ing to do our part.
Let’s work on bills that strengthen
our military, lower drug prices, help
students, assist in the fight against the
opioid crisis, and so much, much more.
I think it is a shame that our Demo-
cratic colleagues seem to be unable to
compartmentalize their feelings about
the President from the urgent need for
them to do the jobs they were elected
to do here in the Congress. They have
been given countless opportunities to
engage with us on a bipartisan basis to
pass meaningful legislation that would
make the American people’s lives bet-
ter. Again, that is why I think we are
here, but they refuse to do anything
that could be construed as giving some-
body a victory because of political con-
siderations. While Senator SCHUMER
continues to kill bipartisan bill after
bipartisan bill—really, because of it—
the work of this Congress has become
paralyzed.
We are not going to give up, though.
We will keep fighting to ensure that
the American people are not the ulti-
mate victims of our Democratic col-
leagues’ war against this President—
again, less than a year before the elec-
tion. Why can’t they channel all of
their anger, all of their energy into the
election rather than invoking the im-
peachment process? This would be the
fourth time that has been initiated in
American history, and it has never
been successful in getting a Senate
conviction and a removal of any Presi-
dent in American history. Our Demo-
cratic colleagues know they are likely

headed to the same conclusion here,
but they nonetheless want to occupy
all of our time and all of our attention
on something that they know, ulti-
mately, will likely be futile, will be un-
successful, and in the meantime leave
the American people on the sideline
and not care or do anything that would

FCC AND C-BAND AUCTION
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I
want to spend a very few minutes
today to say thanks. I want to thank
Chairman Ajit Pai and his colleagues
at the Federal Communications Com-
mission. The Chairman announced yes-
terday that he was going to put 5G
technology and the American taxpayer
first by holding a public auction, as op-
posed to a private auction, of what we
call the C-band. It was a courageous de-
cision that he made against a lot of
pressure.
Allow me, for just a few minutes, to
explain why that is important. We have
all heard about 5G, which stands for
fifth generation. It is a brandnew wire-
less technology. It means incredibly
fast internet and cell phone calls. It
means the ability to deliver as much as
100 times more data through wireless
technology than we can do today.
We will notice it in our iPads; we will
notice it in our computers; but we will
notice it also in our cell phones.
As you know, a cell phone is really a
sophisticated walkie-talkie. I will use
the cell phone as an example to explain
5G. A cell phone is just a very sophisti-
cated, much more complicated walkie-
talkie. How does a walkie-talkie work?
How does a cell phone work? Radio
waves. The scientific term is ‘‘electro-
magnetic radiation.’’
A radio wave is just what it says, a
wave that goes from my cell phone,
say, to the President’s cell phone
through an antenna, a transmitter, and
a receiver. A radio wave and the air
through which it travels and the right
to send a radio wave is a sovereign
asset. It belongs to the American peo-
ple. The American people own that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6643
November 19, 2019
radio wave and the right to send it. Our
FCC gets to decide who gets to use
those radio waves and who has the
right to send those radio waves.
There is a particular type of radio
wave that is absolutely perfect for 5G.
It is between 180 megahertz and 300
megahertz. Why are these radio waves
so perfect for 5G? Well, because they
strike a balance. First, the radio waves
in that spectrum, as it is called, can go
a fairly long distance, and they can
carry huge amounts of data. That is
going to make driverless cars possible.
We have heard about those—the inter-
net of things. That is going to make re-
mote surgery possible, where a doctor
who is in one place physically and
through the internet, using a robot,
can perform surgery on someone 1,000
miles away. 5G going through these
special radio waves is going to make
all that possible. It is going to change
our lives.
Right now, those radio waves—I will
call them the C-band spectrum—as I
said, are owned by the American peo-
ple. They are being used by three sat-
ellite companies—two from Luxem-
bourg and one from Canada—and some
other companies. They are satellite
companies. They don’t own those radio
waves. They don’t even have a license
to use those radio waves. They didn’t
pay anything to get to use those radio
waves. The FCC said they could use
them. It is sort of like a month-to-
month lease or rental agreement where
you don’t have to pay any rent.
Some time ago, those three compa-
nies came to the FCC and said: Even
though we don’t own those radio waves
you allow us to use and even though
the American people own those radio
waves, which are perfect for 5G, we are
willing to give them up to use for 5G,
but here is what we want you to do.
The three foreign companies said: We
want you to give us those radio waves,
and then we will auction them off to
the telecommunications companies
that want to use the radio waves for
5G.
This was the kicker: The three for-
eign corporations said they want to
keep the money.
Investment bankers estimate that
through that auction being conducted
by those three foreign corporations, as
much as $60 billion would have been
generated. That is how much tele-
communications companies would pay
to get the license to use those radio
waves.
Some people encouraged the FCC to
do that. They said that we ought to do
it because these three foreign compa-
nies can do an auction faster than the
FCC can—even though the three for-
eign companies had never done an auc-
tion of spectrum and even though the
FCC has done over 100 public auctions
for other radio waves that the FCC has
auctioned off. In doing that, the fine
men and women at the FCC in charge
of these auctions—they have been
doing it for 25 years—have brought in
$123 billion for the American people.
That will build a lot of interstate, it
will educate a lot of kids, and it will
pay a lot of soldiers.
But our three friends—these foreign
satellite companies—still said: Even
though we have no experience, we can
do it faster. If you let the FCC do it, it
will take them 7 years.
Well, that just wasn’t accurate. I
have spoken to the people in charge of
doing auctions at the FCC. In fact, on
Thursday, they are going to appear be-
fore a subcommittee that I chair. We
are going to talk about it some more.
I don’t know where this figure of 7
years came from, but it is just not ac-
curate.
Nonetheless, the FCC came under—
there are swamp creatures in the gov-
ernment; we know that. Some of these
swamp creatures in and out of govern-
ment put an awful lot of pressure on
the FCC. These swamp creatures are
trying to help some of their friends in
the telecommunications business. One
of the foreign corporations spent about
half a million dollars lobbying. I am
not saying there is something wrong
with that. We all have the right to pe-
tition our government. But that is just
the fact. I don’t mean it in a pejorative
sense.
The FCC was under a lot of pressure,
but yesterday, the Chairman of the
FCC, Ajit Pai, looked at all this. He re-
sisted the pressure, and he announced
that we are going to have a public auc-
tion. We are going to let every tele-
communications company in America
that wants to bid on these valuable air
waves come forward and bid. We are
going to do an auction within a year
and probably less, not 7 years, and the
money that is going to be generated is
going to go to the owner of those radio
waves, not the foreign companies that,
through our benevolence, are now
using those radio waves. The money is
going to go to the American people.
I know what you are thinking. You
are thinking: Gosh, how was this ever
even an issue? This should have been a
no-brainer.
Well, that is part of what is wrong
with Washington, DC, in my judgment.
Sometimes—not always but some-
times—the American people aren’t put
first. But yesterday, Ajit Pai, our
Chairman at the FCC, put them first,
and I just wanted to stand up today
and tell him a genuine and heartfelt
thank-you.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant bill clerk called

Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I

PREVENT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS ACT
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President,
in the last 40 years, we have had 21 gov-
ernment shutdowns—21. Twenty-one
times, Congress and the President have
not been able to agree or the Senate
and the House have not been able to
agree. As a result of that, Federal
workers around the country have faced
the consequences of Members of Con-
gress not finding agreement.
Help me understand this. Twenty-one
times in 40 years, Federal workers who
get up every single day and serve the
American people and serve their neigh-
bors have faced the consequences of
furloughs because Members of Congress
could not come to a resolution. It is
not that it has gone unnoticed. For a
decade or more, there have been solu-
tions that have been proposed.
Ten years ago, I had a proposal in the
House—actually, ROB PORTMAN had a
great proposal in the Senate at the
same time to deal with government
shutdowns. Let’s say when we get to
the end of the fiscal year, we will just
have a continuing resolution, but then
we will cut spending every few months
to press Congress to get to their work.
The problem was, hardly anyone on the
other side agreed with that. We
couldn’t get any bipartisan support for
it. So my colleagues on the other side
of the aisle proposed that if we get to
the end of the fiscal year, we would
have a continuing resolution, and
every couple of months, the spending
would go up, and it would just continue
to go up and up and up until it was re-
solved. Well, they didn’t have anyone
on my side of the aisle saying ‘‘We are
going to put in a mechanism that just
increases spending over and over again
without congressional involvement,’’
so they got no bipartisan support.
An idea was floated to just cut the
pay of the Members of Congress. But it
really wasn’t cutting their pay; it was
taking their pay and putting it in an
escrow account and just kind of hold-
ing it for them, and then when every-
thing was resolved, they would get
their money back. So it really wasn’t a
reduction in pay; it was kind a shell
game—push those dollars off to an-
other side and get them all back later
just to make it look like you got a cut
in pay. But that hasn’t had wide sup-
port either. A lot of people have real
concerns about that because, quite
frankly, some Members of Congress are
very wealthy; some Members are not.
Some Members don’t notice their con-
gressional pay; some do. It is kind of a
disproportionate piece of leverage to
resolve this.
What is interesting is that all those
proposals acknowledged one simple
thing: This is a problem. It needs to be
resolved. Federal workers are facing
the consequences; Members of Congress
are not.
About 5 months ago, MAGGIE HASSAN
and I—this Chamber knows well the
Senator from New Hampshire. She and
I started working together on a non-
partisan—not just a bipartisan but a
nonpartisan—way to stop government
shutdowns. We have two very simple
proposals.
There are two problems here. We
need to stop Federal workers from get-
ting hurt when there is a shutdown and

make sure those families are not hurt.
The second thing is, we want to actu-
ally get to appropriations, not con-
tinuing resolutions.
When do you a continuing resolution
for any length of time, like what we
are in right now—we are in our eighth
week of a continuing resolution right
now. When you do one that long, it
hurts temporary workers who are Fed-
eral workers. They are laid off in the
process. Other folks are not. Many of
these agencies need those temporary
workers, and those temporary workers
are counting on that salary. It hurts
contracting because everything can’t
start in a continuing resolution. You
have to wait until there are real appro-
priations before new programs can
start. You can’t stop old programs. You
can’t do purchasing. It creates a tre-
mendous inefficiency in government.
Our simple idea was this: Let’s find a
way to protect Federal workers and get
to appropriations. The solution we
came up with is pretty straight-
forward. When we get to the end of the
fiscal year, which right now is October
1, if appropriations are not done, there
will be a continuing resolution that
kicks into effect to protect Federal
workers, but Members of Congress and
our staff and the White House Office of
Management and Budget—none of us
can travel. Members of Congress will be
in continuous session 7 days a week
until we get appropriations done. And
one more thing: We can’t move to any
issues other than appropriations. We
are locked into that box.
Basically, if our work is not done, we
all will have to stay until the work is
done. I have had folks say that is not
really a big consequence. A lot of folks
do that all over the country all the
time. If at the end of their workday
their work is not done, they have to
stay until they get it done. Small busi-
ness owners know that full well. It is
not like you can punch a clock. If the
work is not done in a small business,
you stay until it actually gets done.
Here is the thing. Go back to last De-
cember. When the shutdown started
last December and we got to an im-
passe here between the House, the Sen-
ate, and the White House, Members of
Congress and our staff all left and went
home. Federal workers across the
country all took a big, deep breath as
they walked into the holidays because
they were on furlough, but Members of
this body walked out. That should
never happen—never.
What Senator HASSAN and I are pro-
posing is very simple. The pressure
shouldn’t be on Federal workers. They
can’t vote to solve this. The pressure
should be on us.
For everyone in this body who says,
‘‘I don’t like that kind of artificial
pressure,’’ why don’t you feel what it is
like to be a Federal worker for a while
and those Federal employees? They
don’t like that pressure on them. So
let’s flip it. Let’s put the pressure on
us, where it should be, and get it off
the folks, where it should not be, and
let’s stay until we get our work done.
This idea is overly simplistic, but
what is interesting is, for the first time
in a decade, there is an idea that has
bipartisan support. We have multiple
Members of this body who are looking
at it, contemplating it, and then nod-
ding their heads, saying: I would rather
the pressure be on us than on the Fed-
eral workers and their families.
Let’s solve this. We shouldn’t have
government shutdowns. We should
have arguments over debt and deficit.
We should have arguments over the
budget. That is why people sent us
here—to solve how their money is
going to be spent most efficiently and
argue about issues on debt and deficit.
In the meantime, why in the world
would we want to hurt the very people
who serve their neighbors, those people
being the Federal employees around
the country? Let’s keep them out of it.
Let’s keep them still serving their
neighbors, and let’s keep the fight
right here where it needs to be. Let’s
argue this out until we get it resolved,
and let’s not quit until we resolve it. It
is a simple idea that Senator HASSAN
and I actually believe will work.
In the decades to come, people will
look back at the time when we used to
have government shutdowns and will
shake their heads and say: I can’t be-
lieve there was a period of time during
which the Federal government used to
shut down when they argued. Now we
stay until we get the issue settled.
It is a pretty straightforward idea,
and I hope that more of my colleagues
will join us in this absolute commit-
ment to solving this for future genera-
tions.

REMEMBERING KAY HAGAN
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I
want to spend a few minutes recog-
nizing our late colleague and my friend
Senator Kay Hagan.
Kay and I both came to the Senate in
2009. I had the privilege of working
with her on two committees—HELP
and Banking. As a former vice presi-
dent of the North Carolina National
Bank, she had a lot more to offer to
that committee than I had, and I tried
to learn from her whenever I could.
Kay and I both came to the Senate in
the middle of the worst recession since
the Great Depression. We were losing
700,000 jobs a month, and millions were
losing their homes. It was an incred-
ibly difficult moment for the country,
but it brought out all of Kay’s best
qualities.
Everyone knew that Kay faced some
of the toughest politics of any Member
of our caucus, but in those early days,
I saw her take vote after vote on some
of the hardest issues. She never
wavered. She voted for the Recovery
Act to save the economy when we were
in free fall. She voted for Dodd-Frank
to restore confidence and account-
ability to the financial sector, which
was something she knew quite a lot
about. She spoke out against amend-
ment No. 1 in North Carolina and for
marriage equality. She also cast a deci-
sive vote for the Affordable Care Act.
As a Democratic Senator from North
Carolina and as a freshman Senator,
none of those positions were easy to
take, but she knew they were the right
places to be for her State and for the
country. Because Kay did what she did,
millions of Americans kept jobs they
would have lost, and millions of Ameri-
cans gained quality, affordable health
insurance for the first time in their
lives. In her home State, the LGBT
community had a Senator in Wash-
ington who, for the first time in his-
tory, was willing to fight for their full
and equal rights.
One of our colleagues, the senior Sen-
ator from Tennessee, likes to say: If
you have come to Washington just to
hear yourself talk, just stay home and
get a job on the radio. It is not worth
the trouble of your coming all the way
here.
Kay didn’t come to Washington to
talk. She came to work and to lead.
Over her term, Kay was a fierce and
principled advocate for North Carolina.
As a member of the Committee on
Armed Services, she helped to prevent
cuts to tuition programs for veterans.
She sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair
Pay Act to help close the gender pay
gap across the country. She worked
across the aisle to promote conserva-
tion and outdoor recreation, which is
something we appreciate in my home
State of Colorado.
She was a lot less interested in the
empty politics of this town and a lot
more interested in making progress for
the people of North Carolina and for
our country. She was a voice of reason,
pragmatism, and humility in this body,
which sorely lacks all three. In other
words, Kay took her job seriously but
never herself, and no matter how dif-
ficult it might have been, she never
failed to put the people of North Caro-
lina ahead of the politics of the mo-
ment. It is why she earned deep respect
from both sides of the aisle, not only
for her work ethic but for her kindness,
her warmth, and her grace. There was
not a room in this complex, including
the one I am standing in right now,
that wasn’t brightened the moment
that Kay Hagan walked in.
To Chip, her husband, and to their
kids—Jeanette, Tilden, and Carrie—I
hope you know how proud we all are of
Kay. She represented the best qualities
of North Carolina. It is why her col-
leagues adored her. It is why her staff
loved her and revered her, and it is why
all of us who had the privilege of work-
ing with her in this body will miss her
terribly.
I yield the floor.

SATELLITE TELEVISION EXTENSION AND
LOCALISM ACT REAUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I
rise this afternoon because there is a
legislative deadline in front of this
body that we dare not miss. Even as I
speak, our colleagues in the House En-
ergy and Commerce Committee are
considering the Satellite Television
Extension and Localism Act Reauthor-
ization, or STELAR. For 30 years,
STELAR and previous versions of the
law have allowed people who live be-
yond the reach of a broadcast signal to
receive broadcast programming none-
theless.
Some Senators believe that in 2019,
STELAR has outlived its usefulness
and want it to expire, but other Sen-
ators want to extend some of these pro-
visions—at least in the short term—to
prevent consumers from losing these
broadcast signals; still others want to
use the STELAR reauthorization legis-
lation as a vehicle to implement other
reforms.
I have introduced new legislation,
the Satellite Television Access Reau-
thorization—or STAR—Act to move
this process forward. The existing
STELAR statute expires December 31.
So absent congressional action before
the end of the year, the provisions in-
cluded in STELAR that enable nearly
870,000 Americans to access broad-
casting TV signals will no longer be
the law of the land. These Americans
who depend on STELAR are mostly in
rural parts of this country, like my
home State of Mississippi. They in-
clude truckers, tailgaters, and RV driv-
ers, and they include Americans living
in very remote areas.
I say to my colleagues, now is the
time for Senators to make their posi-
tions clear. Over the course of this
year, I have been polling Members to
ascertain what this body wants. As
chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, I will act according to the
majority wishes, but time is running
short. Many people point to the fact
that the media landscape is changing.
There are more options for video con-
tent than ever before. New program-
ming is coming out every day that is
being streamed through new services.
Those are all great things.
As I said at a June Commerce Com-
mittee hearing, we are living in the
golden age of television. The Com-
merce Committee has been working to
close the digital divide between rural
and urban America to make sure all
families can access those choices and
all families can be a part of the golden
age, but there are still Americans with-
out Internet access and without broad-
cast signals. They deserve the ability
to view basic television services just
like everyone else.
Without the reauthorization of
STELAR, many Americans will not be
able to watch broadcast news or enjoy
access to programming that is avail-
able for the rest of the country. They
will be on the wrong side of the digital
divide, and there will be a wide cul-
tural divide, as they would be cut off
from the flow of programs and informa-
tion.
If Members of this body are of a mind
to move forward with some extension
of this statute, we will work with our
colleagues in the House. That may in-
clude improvements and enhancements
to STELAR that address good faith re-
quirements, level the playing field in
the marketplace, promote access to
programming, and ensure robust com-
petition, but we don’t have much time.
After this week, Senators will go
home for Thanksgiving. Many of those
across the country who benefit from
STELAR in our States will watch foot-
ball games and the Macy’s Thanks-
giving Day Parade, thanks to the
STELAR law. They will enjoy time
with their families, and I look forward
to doing the same, but when Congress
returns, there will be just 2 weeks—10
legislative days—to finalize any legis-
lation and send it to the President for
his signature.
In this body, taking no action is
easy. It comes naturally. But in this
case, no action equals the repeal of the
STELAR law in its entirety, and Mem-
bers should know that. They have 10
days to ensure 870,000 Americans will
be able to watch the same programs
next year that they are seeing this
year, or we can let STELAR expire and
take the risk of letting the chips fall
where they may.
To repeat, my colleagues should be
advised they need to make a voice that
is heard on whether the STELAR legis-
lation needs to be extended or expire.
Thank you, Madam President.
I yield the floor. I suggest the ab-
sence a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 2486
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise
today to urge immediate passage of the
bipartisan FUTURE Act, which is H.R.
2486, to restore critical funding for his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities, known by the acronym here in
Washington as HBCUs, as well as mi-
nority-serving institutions, so-called
MSIs.
The $255 million in funding that
HBCUs and MSIs rely on lapsed on Sep-
tember 30 of this year. Both the his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities and the minority-serving institu-
tions are underresourced and don’t
have the flexibility to operate in the
red in the hopes of potential reimburse-
ment later on.
Campuses are already feeling this im-
pact. Just 2 weeks after this program
expired, some campuses notified em-
ployees that their positions and pro-
grams may be terminated. We are talk-
ing about real people losing their jobs
and programs being cut that play a
critical role in graduating and retain-
ing students in the STEM field—
science, technology, engineering, and
math fields. All of this is impacting
students across the country. Presidents
of some of these institutions have told
us that planning has ‘‘all but stopped.’’
This funding lapse is urgent, and it
must be addressed now.
From the perspective of my home
State of Pennsylvania, we have two of
the oldest historically Black colleges
and universities—two of the oldest in
the whole country—Cheyney Univer-
sity, as well as Lincoln University,
and, in addition to that, a growing His-
panic-serving institution, in this case,
the Reading Area Community College.
We know that the investment made
by the FUTURE Act will support col-
lege completion and academic opportu-
nities at these and all historically
Black colleges and universities and mi-
nority-serving institutions across the
country. The FUTURE Act is fully paid
for. It would not add to the deficit. It
has strong bipartisan support in both
Chambers.
My colleagues in the majority are
holding this funding hostage in an ef-
fort to pass what I would argue is a
partisan bill. That is not just my argu-
ment or my opinion; some of my Re-
publican colleagues have said this is
the reason they are holding up this
critical legislation.
Instead of passing a bipartisan com-
prehensive reauthorization of our fu-
ture higher education law, which my
colleague Senator MURRAY is pushing
for, some Republicans want to force
Democrats to support a partisan bill.
Instead of working in a bipartisan
fashion to fix our current system so it
works better for students, families, and
teachers, they want us to support a so-
called micropackage, the Student Aid
Improvement Act. This act, in my
judgment and the judgment of others,
fails to address a number of critical
areas, including improved campus safe-
ty and access to higher education af-
fordability and accountability. Because
of that, it maintains the status quo.
Make no mistake, the Student Aid
Improvement Act is a partisan bill.
The bill fails to address the challenges
students are facing in obtaining a col-
lege degree—including childcare, hous-
ing, food and mental health, among
others—nor does it address the needs of
first-generation students, students of
color, and students with disabilities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6646 November 19, 2019
Let’s debate these issues. Let’s come
to the table to negotiate on a bipar-
tisan overhaul, but let’s not hold his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities and minority-serving institu-
tions hostage in the meantime. We can
get something done in the short run
that would be beneficial to these insti-
tutions.
We need to ensure that colleges and
universities have the resources to pro-
vide support to all students they serve,
including students with disabilities. A
couple of examples of some of my
bills—the Higher Education Mental
Health Act, which is supported by over
250 college and university presidents,
including 15 of the historically Black
colleges and universities—would help
institutions of higher education iden-
tify the resources and services needed
to support their students with mental
health needs.
A second bill of mine, the RISE Act,
would make it easier for colleges to
provide support to students with dis-
abilities by accepting student assess-
ments from high school and smoothing
the transition to higher education.
A third bill, my Expanding Disability
Access to Higher Education Act, would
increase the funding for TRIO Pro-
grams that serve first-generation stu-
dents with disabilities and make higher
education more accessible.
These bills would provide the re-
sources needed for students to be suc-
cessful as they pursue higher edu-
cation, but without a comprehensive
bill, the needs of these students will
continue to go unmet. Rather than
blocking vital resources from flowing
to our Nation’s historically Black col-
leges and universities, we should im-
mediately pass the FUTURE Act. This
would restore funding, while providing
us time to work on a comprehensive re-
authorization that addresses the needs
of all students.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that as in legislative session, the
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 212, H.R.
2486. I ask unanimous consent that the
Murray amendment at the desk be
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be
considered read a third time and
passed; and that the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
am reserving the right to object.
I have a better idea, which I am
going to offer to the Senate once again.
It is permanent funding for historically
Black colleges at the level of $255 mil-
lion a year. The distinguished Senator
from Pennsylvania has stated he
doesn’t want a piecemeal bill. He wants
a more comprehensive bill. I have of-
fered such a bill and introduced it in
the Senate. I will describe it in a few
moments when I ask unanimous con-
sent to pass it, and it will include not
a 2-year short-term fix based upon a
budget gimmick, which will have dif-
ficulty passing the Senate, but perma-
nent funding of historically Black col-
leges and minority-serving institu-
tions.
It will include simplification of the
FAFSA, the form that 8 million minor-
ity students fill out every year, which
in our State is the biggest obstacle to
minority students having an oppor-
tunity for higher education and a vari-
ety of other bipartisan proposals.
I am ready to pass a comprehensive
bill. I offered one before. It was blocked
by my Democratic friends. I am going
to offer it again in a minute, and we
will see if they agree to it, but I don’t
think we should pass a piecemeal bill.
I agree with the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania. I think we should be more com-
prehensive, and not only that, we
should do permanent funding of his-
torically Black colleges.
The last point I will make before I
object is that the U.S. Department of
Education has written all the presi-
dents of the historically Black and mi-
nority-serving institutions and said
there is sufficient funding in the Fed-
eral Government for the rest of the
year—fiscal year—until October 1 of
next year. So while we need to finish
our work, there is no crisis at the mo-
ment, so let’s do the job right.
I will offer, in just a moment, the
way to do that, which is permanent
funding of historically Black colleges
and minority-serving institutions. I ob-
ject.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2557
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, for
the convenience of the Senator from
Pennsylvania, I am going to offer my
unanimous consent agreement at the
beginning of my remarks, and then if
he wishes to stay, he can, but if he has
another place to go in his schedule, he
may do that.
Let me just say that the provision I
am going to—let me preface it in this
way. I know very well the value of his-
torically Black colleges. One of my fa-
vorite stories is the story that the late
author, Alex Haley, the author of
‘‘Roots’’ and ‘‘The Autobiography of
Malcolm X’’—I suppose the two best
selling books ever on the history of the
African American—used to tell about
his father, Simon P. Haley, who was
wasted as a child. That was the word
they used.
He was allowed to go to college, and
he went to North Carolina A&T where
he was ready to drop out. He came
back, got a summer job on a Pullman
train to Chicago, and a man talked to
him at night asking him for a glass of
warm milk. He got the glass of warm
milk and thought nothing more about
it. He went back to North Carolina
A&T, a historically Black college.
The principal called him in. He
thought he was in real trouble, as the
president of the college called him in.
Simon P. Haley thought he was in real
trouble. The President of the college
said that the man on the train had sent
enough money for Simon P. Haley to
graduate—to pay his tuition to grad-
uate from college.
So Alex Haley wrote for the Reader’s
Digest the story of the man on the
train who helped his father. That fa-
ther went to Cornell and became the
first Black graduate of Cornell’s agri-
cultural college. He came back to Lane
College, one of the six historically
Black colleges in Tennessee, where he
taught and raised a son, who is a law-
yer, later Ambassador to Gambia; two
daughters, one a teacher; he raised an-
other son, an architect; and then he
raised a son he thought wouldn’t
amount to anything who joined the
Coast Guard and ended up writing a
Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ‘‘Roots,’’
and ‘‘The Autobiography of Malcolm
X.’’
I know the value of Lane College,
Fisk University, Tennessee State Uni-
versity, Lemoyne-Owen College,
Meharry Medical College, and America
Baptist College, and I want to help
them. The request I am going to make
is that the Senate pass a small package
of bills that are sponsored by Demo-
crats and Republicans, 29 Senators—17
Democrats and 12 Republicans. The
first provision would be permanent
funding. That is $255 million every year
permanently for historically Black col-
leges and minority-serving institu-
tions. A second provision—I ask con-
sent to use this document on the Sen-
ate floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. ALEXANDER. That is the
FAFSA. This is the document that 20
million Americans fill out every year.
We know how to reduce it. It is the big-
gest impediment to minority students
going to college today. We are ready to
pass it. Eight million minority stu-
dents fill this out. The president of the
Southwest Community College from
Memphis tells me he loses 1,500 stu-
dents a semester because of the com-
plexity of that.
There are other provisions in this
package, which include the Portman-
Kaine provision for short-term Pell
grants sponsored by about 20 Senators,
many of them Democrats; the provi-
sion for Pell grants for prisoners who
are eligible for parole; an increase in
the number of Pell grants; an increase
in the amount of Pell grants. All of
that is in this package that I have of-
fered, but it starts with permanent
funding for historically black colleges.
Since there is time until October 1 of
next year, the Department of Edu-
cation has said that there is plenty of
Federal funding for all of those institu-
tions. There is no reason we can’t agree
to my package today, send it over to
the House of Representatives, send it
to the President, and let all of these in-
stitutions know they don’t have to
worry about funding permanently in-
stead of just for 2 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6647
November 19, 2019
So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous
consent that the Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of
S. 2557 and the Senate proceed to its
immediate consideration. I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, reserving
the right to object, I just want to make
a couple of comments by way of re-
sponse.
I really want to go back to what we
said earlier. There is no reason we
can’t at least get this piece of legisla-
tion done. I will say it again: These in-
stitutions are underresourced. They
don’t have the flexibility to operate in
the red in the hopes of potential reim-
bursement later on.
We are also told by the institutions
themselves that planning has ‘‘all but
stopped.’’ Campuses are feeling this
impact already. Just 2 weeks after this
program expired, some campuses in-
formed employees that their positions
and programs may be terminated. So I
would argue that the present cir-
cumstance is not acceptable.
I realize the chairman wants to pro-
ceed to other issues, and I respect that,
but when you consider what he is pro-
posing, there are some changes that
should be pointed out.
First of all, when considering the
proposal he has, in comparing what it
would do, for example, on the Second
Chance Pell proposal, that only con-
tains a limited repeal of the ban rather
than a full repeal of the ban. Any ref-
erence to the JOBS Act making short-
term programs eligible for Pell
grants—a bipartisan bill that was in-
troduced—excludes for-profit colleges.
In this micropackage that the chair-
man is proposing, the for-profit col-
leges are added back in.
No. 3, just by way of some examples,
in the Grassley-Smith bill on financial
aid award letters, some changes were
made to that on financial aid award
letters that weren’t contemplated by
the bill’s original authors.
Our legislation is fully paid for. It re-
invests up to $55 million in recovery
programs. For several reasons, by way
of contrast but also by way of what is
happening right now with regard to
these institutions—for those and other
reasons, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
know this Senate is a deliberative
body, but we have been working on
higher education for 5 years in our
committee, and suddenly, out of the
blue, comes a bill out of the House
which says that we have an emergency
in one provision of the Higher Edu-
cation Act; don’t take it through com-
mittee. That is the way we usually do
things.
The distinguished Senator from Lou-
isiana is a member of this committee,
and the Senator from Pennsylvania is a
valued member of the committee. We
have a pretty good reputation for
working together, despite our dif-
ferences, in fixing No Child Left Be-
hind, 21st Century Cures, opioid legis-
lation. Healthcare is a contentious
issue, but by a vote of 20 to 3, we
brought out a bill to lower healthcare
costs.
Yet the suggestion is that we take
this bill to the Senate floor without
any consideration by the committee.
That is not the way we usually do
things.
Let me reemphasize that the U.S. De-
partment of Education has told every
one of the historically Black colleges
and minority-serving institutions that
there is sufficient Federal funding be-
tween now and October 1 of next year.
There is no reason to cut anybody’s
pay and no reason to stop planning.
That is what the Federal Government
has told those institutions. That is
plenty of time for us to take a provi-
sion—such as the one I have proposed
or such as the one that the distin-
guished Senator from Pennsylvania has
proposed—through our committee and
recommend to the full Senate what we
ought to do.
Let’s not minimize what else there is
to do. I mean, we literally have been
working for 5 years on simplifying this
FAFSA. There are 8 million minority
students who fill it out every year. I
think we should be concerned about
the 300,000 students who attend histori-
cally Black colleges and universities.
Many of them fill this out. I am told by
the former Governor of Tennessee that
filling out this complicated form is the
single biggest impediment for low-in-
come students having an opportunity
to go to college because their families
think it is too complicated.
Well, we know what to do about this.
Senator BENNET, the Democratic Sen-
ator from Colorado, and I began work-
ing on this 5 years ago. Senator MUR-
RAY, the Democratic Senator from
Washington, and I recommended that
the Senate pass legislation getting rid
of 22 questions that were double report-
ing. You have to tell the IRS some
facts, and you have to tell the Depart-
ment of Education the same facts, and
then they come in the middle of the se-
mester and try to catch you having one
answer here and another answer there.
So at East Tennessee State University,
70 percent of the student body has their
Pell grant verified, and some of them
lose their Federal funding while they
check to see if the information they
had to give to two Federal agencies is
different. We passed the Senate with
that—Senator MURRAY and I did that
last year.
So why should we wait on this? I
don’t think we should wait on perma-
nent funding for historically Black col-
leges, but why hold this hostage to
that?
I am ready to move ahead on perma-
nent funding for historically Black col-
leges. I am ready to move ahead on
simplifying the FAFSA for 8 million
students who fill this out every year. I
am ready to move ahead on short-term
Pell grants. I have been working with
the Senator from Washington on this
and with other Members of the Senate.
I think we are moving to a consensus.
We have time to do this right. Let’s
take it through committee and send
back to the House of Representatives a
permanent solution.
I think it is very important that we
make clear to all of the presidents and
all of the students at historically
Black colleges and minority-serving in-
stitutions, No. 1, you have a year of
funding ahead of you; No. 2, you have a
proposal by the chairman of the Edu-
cation Committee that will perma-
nently fund what you are doing; and
No. 3, our Democratic friends are ask-
ing that the Senate pass short-term
funding that will create another fund-
ing cliff within a matter of months and
that is funded by a budget gimmick
that will never pass muster in the Sen-
ate. That is not going to happen.
So we need to work together as we
normally do and come to a conclusion
on the Higher Education Act, including
permanent funding of historically
Black colleges and minority institu-
tions. I am ready to keep doing that.
But I am also ready to encourage the
passage not only of the provisions that
I have introduced and that I asked for
permission to pass today, which the
Senator objected to, but other provi-
sions that might be included.
I think 5 years is long enough to
work on the Higher Education Act. I
am coming to the conclusion we have
time to do it, and I look forward to
saying to our six historically Black
colleges in Tennessee that the result of
our hard work and debate and discus-
sion has been permanent funding, so
you don’t have to worry about Federal
funding.
Mr. BURR. Mr. Chairman, will the
Senator yield?
Mr. ALEXANDER. I will yield.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina.
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank
the chairman for yielding, and I am
here as living proof that he is not the
Lone Ranger on this. The committee
has worked diligently. We may not be
as passionate as he is, but the com-
mittee has worked diligently to get
higher education done.
It is a farce to come in here and
think that we are going to pass a 2-
year House bill to fund historically
Black colleges. Nobody has more his-
torically Black colleges in their State
than I do. What they want—they want
predictability, permanent funding. The
chairman is willing to do that, but part
of the condition to do that is to sit
down and, now, quit talking and pass
higher education. Reduce the FAFSA
application to one page. Let these stu-
dents go out—and their parents—and
be able to fill this out and not miss an
education because they can’t go
through the laborious process.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6648 November 19, 2019
What the chairman has laid on the
table is reasonable. The committee has
talked about it for years. Now it is
time to act. It is not time to act on one
little piece of it for temporary funding.
It is time to provide permanent fund-
ing for that and to do the rest of higher
education.
As proud as I am of our being the
home of the majority of Black colleges
and universities, I also have about 70
other colleges and universities in
North Carolina, and they are the bene-
ficiaries of everything else that is in
this education bill.
Compromise is not about ‘‘Take what
I have’’ and not give anything else. We
have been trying to work, with the
chairman and the ranking member
working together, to find compromise
for 5 years. Many times the chairman
has come to me and said: I think we
can do it this year. Well, we have to
have willing partners on the other side
of the aisle. Today is a live example of
where it is either their way or no way.
I hope we can get back, and, before
we leave this year, we can get this
package passed. It is really simple:
Just commit to do what we all have sat
down and talked about for 5 years. If
there are minor changes that need to
be made, let’s make them in the next
day or two. But to say that we are
going to wait until next year and be
here a year from now when that time-
frame has run out, let me assure you, if
the chairman is not here to object to
this request, I will be here to object to
this request.
The time to talk is over. The time to
act is now.
I thank the chairman for yielding.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. CASEY. Just a couple of points
on where we are: There is no question
that, in my judgment, if you have more
time to consider these issues for a full
reauthorization, we could address some
of the shortcomings that have been
proposed already. I mentioned earlier
issues that are not addressed, such as
childcare, housing, food and mental
health, the needs of first-generation
students, needs of students of color,
and students with disabilities. We can
do that if we can get through this
short-term period. We are asking for
help only for a very limited timeframe
so that we can work through these
other issues.
The second point I would make is, I
can’t stand in the shoes of the leaders
of these institutions, but when they
tell us that they are in a difficult cir-
cumstance in the short run, I will take
their word for it. The word of the De-
partment of Education—just from my
point of view—doesn’t compare to what
these institutions are telling us. So I
think we should rely upon the rep-
resentations by the leaders of the insti-
tutions and act in a short-term fash-
ion, all the while committing ourselves
to have a longer process to fully ex-
plore and try to reach consensus on a
range of issues that come under the
broad purview of reauthorization.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. I want to thank
the Senator from Pennsylvania for
coming to the floor today on an issue I
know he cares about. I thank the Sen-
ator from North Carolina.
We are accustomed to working to-
gether. We are accustomed to getting
results, and I want to get a result on
this.
I agree with both Senators in this
sense: I think it is time to send a sig-
nal to historically Black colleges and
minority-serving institutions that they
don’t have to worry about funding for
the future. For the next year, the De-
partment of Education has told them:
You have the money for the next year.
It shouldn’t take us a year to finish our
work.
So I look forward to sitting down
with the Senator from North Carolina
and the Senator from Pennsylvania
and working out their differences on
the provisions that we have. We have
the basis for a very good higher edu-
cation bill—the permanent funding for
historically Black colleges, the sim-
plification of the FAFSA, which affects
20 million families every year. We have
broad bipartisan consensus on simpli-
fying how you pay back student loans.
There are nine different ways now. We
could reduce that to two. That affects
43 million families.
The short-term Pell grants make a
big difference.
So we have a number of provisions,
and I am working well, as I always do,
with the Senator from Washington,
Mrs. MURRAY. I would like to bring this
to a conclusion as rapidly as we can. I
think this debate has been useful to do
that. I look forward to continuing it.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President,
for this 259th climate speech, I am
going to return to the theme of corrup-
tion. Before diving into the how, let’s
start with the why because the scale
and the remorselessness of the scheme
of corruption the fossil fuel industry
has run is hard to comprehend without
understanding why.
Here is the why. The fossil fuel indus-
try reaps the biggest subsidy in the
history of the planet. I will say that
again. The fossil fuel industry reaps
the biggest subsidy in the history of
the planet. The IMF—International
Monetary Fund—estimates that the
global subsidy for fossil fuel is in the
trillions of dollars every year. That is
globally. In the United States alone,
the fossil fuel industry got a $650 bil-
lion—that is with a ‘‘b’’—subsidy in
2015, according to the most recent re-
port from the IMF. That is about $2,000
out of the pocket of every man,
woman, and child in the United States.
Here is that IMF report. Look it up.
Read it and weep.
Stop for a minute and understand
this subsidy. Some of it is favorable
tax deals and other direct subsidies
that pour public taxpayer money into
the pockets of this polluting industry.
In recent years, that has been esti-
mated at around $20 billion annually.
The vast bulk of this $650 billion is
something else. It is people getting
hurt. It is the cost of people suffering
economic harms. It is the cost of your
home burned in a wildfire or swept
away in a storm by rising seas. It is the
cost of farms withered from unprece-
dented droughts or crops drowned in
unprecedented flooding. It is the cost
of fisheries that are lost or moved
away as oceans warm and acidify. It is
the lost day of work with your kid in
the emergency room waiting out a cli-
mate-related asthma attack on the
ER’s nebulizer. It is the cost of tick-
borne and mosquito-borne illnesses
that didn’t used to be where you live.
It is the cost to dive tours of tourists
seeing dead, white, bleached coral reefs
instead of vibrant undersea gardens
and the cost to snowmobile moose
tours of going through mud instead of
snow and when you see moose, seeing
emaciated moose calves with thou-
sands of ticks slowly killing them. It is
the cost of American military deploy-
ments to conflicts caused by resource
scarcity or climate migration. It is the
cost of relocating Naval Station Nor-
folk when the community around it
floods out. It is the cost of Glacier
Park with no glacier. It is the cost of
trout streams with no trout. It is the
cost of millions of acres of healthy for-
ests killed off by pine beetle infesta-
tion. It is the cost to Phoenix of staff-
ing up emergency services when it is
not safe to work outside because it is
too hot and lost airline flights out of
the airport when the tarmac melts. It
is the myriad costs of basic operating
systems of the natural world gone hay-
wire because of climate change.
All this pain, all this loss, all this
suffering has a bloodless economic
name: externalities. Externalities are
the social costs that are imposed on
others by the use of a product. Pollu-
tion, of course, is the obvious example.
In economic theory, those social costs
should be baked into the price of a
product. That is why courts and com-
panies and countries around the world
apply a social cost of carbon calcula-
tion.
But destroying the basic operating
systems of the planet is a high-priced
externality—by the IMF report, $650
billion in 2015 just in the United
States. And because it is hard to cal-
culate a price for so much of this harm,
that is a lowball estimate. For in-
stance, we can estimate the loss to the
dive shop of the coral reef off the coast
dying, but is that really the full cost of
the dead reef? There is a lot more. So
the externality is probably well over
$650 billion.
By comparison, let’s look at the five
major oil companies’ earnings. The five
major oil companies earned somewhat
more than $80 billion in profits last
year all around the world, all right?

November 19, 2019
Global profits are $80 billion versus $650
billion in destruction and harm they
caused just in the United States. So
make those oil companies follow the
rules of market economics. Make them
put the cost of the harm of their prod-
uct into the price of their product—$80
billion versus $650 billion—and guess
what: Their business is in a $570-plus
billion hole. That is why the fossil fuel
industry is so corrupt. It knows it
needs to break the laws of market eco-
nomics in order to survive, and it
knows it needs political help to do
that.
Fortunately for the fossil fuel indus-
try, up against that $650 billion sub-
sidy, politicians come cheap. They
could put $650 million into politics
every single year, and it would earn
them a 1,000-to-1 return on that ex-
penditure protecting the $650 billion
subsidy.
So that is the why of fossil fuel cor-
ruption: It pays. It pays hugely. It is as
simple as that. They are corrupt be-
cause it pays.
Now let’s look at the how.
By the way, they have some expertise
in this area. These companies operate
in the most crooked countries in the
world, so they know how to work
crooked deals and politics. But what
happened here in the United States?
Well, I saw it happen. The big change
came when five Republican Supreme
Court Justices gave this industry and
other mega industries big new political
artillery. It came in the disgraceful
Citizens United decision that let un-
limited special interest money into our
elections.
I will tell you, there is no special in-
terest more unlimited than fossil fuel.
Fossil fuel front groups were all over
that Supreme Court case, by the way,
signaling to the five Republicans on
the Court what they wanted them to
do, and sure enough, they did it.
Of course, it does take some fun out
of spending unlimited money in poli-
tics if people can tell who you are. In
theory, we were supposed to know. To
get to the outcome the fossil fuel in-
dustry wanted, the five Republican
Justices had to pretend, as a legal mat-
ter, that all this political spending—all
this unlimited political spending they
were authorizing—was going to be
transparent, that we would know who
was behind it.
Well, that transparency was not
going to work very well for Exxon or
Koch Industries or Marathon Petro-
leum, so they cooked up all sorts of
schemes to hide behind. Tax-deductible
501(c)(4)s appeared that can hide their
donors. Trade groups like the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce got taken over
and co-opted. Disposable shell corpora-
tions turned up behind political dona-
tions. An enterprise called Donors
Trust was established, whose sole pur-
pose is to launder the identity of big
donors.
By the way—back to Citizens
United—those five Republican Justices
would have to be idiots not to see this
apparatus of phony front groups out
there mocking their assurances of
transparency—assurances that were at
the heart of the Citizens United deci-
sion—but those Justices have stu-
diously ignored this flagrantly obvious
flaw and have made zero effort to clean
up their unlimited-spending, dark-
money mess. I was taught as a kid that
you are supposed to clean up the
messes you made. That is not a mes-
sage that got through to the ‘‘Roberts
Five.’’
We have addressed this flotilla of
propped-up, dark-money front groups
in the Senate before. We call it the web
of denial. Academics who study these
groups have documented well over 100
of them in the last decade. That sounds
like a lot—100 front groups—but re-
member, there is $650 billion a year
riding on this. And it is a really big
help if you can pretend you are, say,
Americans for Peace and Puppies and
Prosperity instead of ExxonMobil or
the Kochs or Marathon Petroleum.
People tend to get the joke when the
ad says: Brought to you by
ExxonMobil.
So they have the motive and the
means to spend millions of political
dollars and to do so from hiding. How
much do they spend? Well, that is hard
to tell because the whole purpose is to
hide. Responsible watchdogs won’t
even venture a guess as to how much
dark money is sloshing through the po-
litical system, but total dark money
spending on Federal elections has been
at least $700 million since the Citizens
United decision, according to the Cen-
ter for Responsive Politics. The lion’s
share of that dark money is probably
from fossil fuels because, first, nobody
else has the same corrupt motive on
the scale of fossil fuel. Plus, when you
look at the spending, it is usually
groups who can be connected to fossil
fuel. And for most, the activity is cli-
mate denial and obstruction, so it is
fossil fuel work being done. So it is
pretty easy to conclude who is likely
behind all this.
For colleagues who weren’t here be-
fore 2010, let me tell you, things were
different then. In 2007, 2008, and 2009—
those were my first 3 years here—there
were lots of bipartisan climate bills
kicking around the Senate, real ones
that would have headed off the crisis
into which we are rocketing right now.
Heck, in 2008, the Republican nominee
for President ran on a strong climate
platform.
After the Citizens United decision in
January of 2010, all of that was snuffed
out. An oily curtain of denial fell
around the Republican Party as the
fossil fuel industry brought its new po-
litical weapons to bear. The before and
after comparison is as plain as day, and
it cost us a decade of inaction when
time was of the essence. It has been a
high cost except, of course, for the fos-
sil fuel industry, whose lying and deny-
ing, whose front groups and dark
money, whose political obstruction and
threats still remain fully dedicated to
protecting that $650 billion subsidy.
Do the math just for a second. At $650
billion a year, from January 2010 until
now, Citizens United let the fossil fuel
industry protect nearly $6 trillion in
subsidy—$6 trillion in losses to our
constituents, $6 trillion that this in-
dustry dodged in the laws of market ec-
onomics to foist on everyone else—and
you wonder why they worked so hard
to take over the courts.
The fossil fuels’ denial operation and
obstruction operation is likely the big-
gest and most corrupt scheme in
human history. I can’t think of one
that is worse, and it is still operating
today—right now—as I stand here and
speak. Its oily tides pollute our public
debate with deliberate falsehoods and
nonsense, grease our press to steer
away from this subject, slosh slimily
through the hallways of this very
building, and grip the Supreme Court
in a web of oily, dark money influence.
We have become like the people who
have lived in the shadows for so long
and have forgotten what sunlight, what
free debate, what laws based on facts
can look like.
The fossil fuel industry has polluted
our American democracy on as massive
a scale as it has polluted our atmos-
phere and oceans. For those in our his-
tory who gave up their lives—who died
in the service of our democracy—who
are looking down on us now, that pol-
lution of the democracy they died de-
fending must be a bitter spectacle.
As a boy, there was an ominous hymn
that we often sang in chapel about how
‘‘once to every man and nation comes
the moment to decide, in the strife of
Truth with Falsehood, for the good or
evil side.’’ ‘‘Truth,’’ the hymn went on,
is ‘‘forever on the scaffold, wrong for-
ever on the throne,’’ but ‘‘though the
cause of Evil prosper, yet ‘tis Truth
alone is strong.’’
Now is our moment to decide: Do we
finally bring down fossil fuels’ false
Babylon of corruption or, in the strife
of truth with falsehood, do we keep
protecting the evil side?
I yield the floor.

FREEDOM AROUND THE WORLD
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it
really has been quite a year here in
Washington for drawn-out policy bat-
tles. It is November, and we are still
fighting over defense spending, trade,
and the results of an election long
since decided in 2016.
A quick flip through this morning’s
world news sections serves as my daily
reminder that Americans really do
have so much for which to be thankful.
One might even feel inclined to say we
are really lucky to live here in the
United States. Yet I will tell you that
luck really doesn’t have a lot to do
with it. Our freedom was bought with
the blood of thousands who instigated
a revolution in spite of being outspent,
outmanned, and outgunned by the
global superpower of their time, and
thank goodness they had that fighting
spirit. That same absolute belief in the

right to self-determination went on to
fuel the abolitionists, the women’s suf-
fragists, and the civil rights warriors.
Their fearlessness inspires freedom
movements that we are seeing all
across the globe today.
Just a few months ago, heads turned
toward China as thousands of Hong
Kong people poured into the streets
and said no to Beijing’s stranglehold,
but just saying no wasn’t enough. Now
their neighborhoods and universities
have morphed into war zones, and Chi-
nese authorities have long since justi-
fied shooting live rounds of ammuni-
tion into the crowds.
Imagine the intensity of the fear it
takes to push a government to fire on
its own people when the entire world is
watching. Beijing is worried, but Bei-
jing will also not hesitate to use any
force it deems necessary to tighten its
grip on Hong Kong.
Now, here in the Senate, we are
working on a few pieces of legislation
to let the Chinese and the Hong Kong
Governments know that the United
States is watching. We have included a
bill that will prevent U.S. companies
from exporting crowd control supplies
to the Hong Kong Police Force. It is
important, though, for everyone to un-
derstand that the motivating factors
behind political oppression have noth-
ing to do with tear gas or with stun
guns. There is only so much that legis-
lation can do.
Governments in Iraq, Vietnam, Alge-
ria, and Lebanon are also hard at work
in doing whatever they can to prevent
their citizens from stepping out of line,
because they know what will happen if
their citizens are free to criticize the
state, and they are terrified of losing
power.
This month, the entire world looks
toward Central Europe to commemo-
rate the fall of the Berlin Wall. When
East Berliners first stepped into the
western half of their city, they re-
vealed to the rest of the world the hor-
rors of living under a political regime
that sustained itself by consuming the
autonomy of its subjects. History
serves as an enduring warning against
the dangers of the all-powerful state.
As we watch mass protests play out a
half a world away, many Americans
still see social chaos not as a symptom
of a disease but as a spontaneous ex-
pression of some nebulous desire to be
free. They don’t stop to recall what
sparked the first feelings of unease
long before the Molotov cocktails
started flying through the air.
This is why, here in the United
States, my colleagues in the majority
have forced many conversations on the
perils of degrading the foundations of
our Republic. We have debated ad nau-
seam the Constitution’s place in civil
and legal discourse, asking: Does it
provide a workable standard or is it
just an outdated piece of paper now
rendered illegitimate by the male
whiteness of its drafters? I think the
Presiding Officer knows my response.
We defend the Constitution and the
system of government it created be-
cause we know, from studying history
and from observing current events,
that freedom does not suddenly expire.
Freedom begins to wither the moment
those in power convince themselves
that a reprieve from uncomfortable
policy debates over speech, self-de-
fense, or the size of government will be
worth the risk of shelving the stand-
ards that protect individual liberty.
The current blase tolerance and, in
some cases, incomprehensible enthu-
siasm for socialism and other authori-
tarian philosophies is sending a strong
message to the rest of the world that
the standard for global freedom is up
for debate. If we acquiesce to the argu-
ment that America’s founding prin-
ciples have passed their expiration
date, we will have failed as a people
and as a world leader. That failure will
change the course of our history, and it
will be used as a weapon to quash dis-
sent elsewhere in the world.
I yield the floor.

f
HONG KONG HUMAN RIGHTS AND
DEMOCRACY ACT OF 2019
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, in a mo-
ment here, as my colleagues gather, we
hope to pass the Hong Kong Human
Rights and Democracy Act.
I first acknowledge all of the people
who worked so hard on it—our staffs,
obviously, and, in addition, Senators
CARDIN, RISCH, MENENDEZ, and over 50
cosponsors, many of whom will join us
here this evening. I also thank Leaders
MCCONNELL and SCHUMER for their sup-
port in helping us get here. I thank
Chairman CRAPO, who has helped us
make some important changes at the
end that will make the sanctions easier
to implement.
A lot of people have been watching
on the news the protests that have
been going on in Hong Kong and are
wondering as to, perhaps, the depths of
what it is all about.
When the United Kingdom handed
Hong Kong over to China, they signed
an agreement that is known as the
Joint Declaration. It basically guaran-
tees a high degree of autonomy and
freedom of the people of Hong Kong. As
a result of that agreement, the United
States has treated commerce and trade
with Hong Kong differently than it has
its commercial and trade activity with
the mainland of China. What has hap-
pened over the last few years is the
steady effort, on the part of Chinese
authorities, to erode that autonomy
and those freedoms.
The most recent protests really
began with a proposal to pass an extra-
dition law that would allow the Chi-
nese Government to basically have ar-
rested and extradite someone in Hong
Kong over to the mainland. There was
a huge pushback against that, and pro-
tests emerged as a result of it. Even
though the Government of Hong Kong
has pulled out from pursuing that law,
the protests have continued because
the people of Hong Kong have seen
what is coming. They see the steady ef-
fort to erode their autonomy and their
freedoms.
The response by the Hong Kong au-
thorities, with its having been under
tremendous pressure from Beijing, has
been that of violence and repression.
So far, over 5,000 people have been ar-
rested in Hong Kong. The youngest has
been 12 years of age. The oldest has
been 82. Hundreds more have been in-
jured by violence committed by police
authorities but also by street gangs—
criminals, thugs—who have been em-
powered and encouraged by the Chinese
authorities.
This effort by China to exert control
and remove autonomy continues
unabated. Here are some examples.
There was a law that was passed that
banned wearing masks, and a Hong
Kong court ruled that the ban was un-
constitutional. The so-called National
People’s Congress in Beijing today
ruled that Hong Kong courts have no
authority—no power—to review Hong
Kong Government legislation. Under
pressure from Beijing, the Government
of Hong Kong threatened to cancel the
November 24 elections—elections, by
the way, that China has been inter-
fering in. China has pushed to ban crit-
ics, like Joshua Wong, from running.
Seven candidates who are running have
been attacked by street gangs during
this campaign, and two candidates
have been arrested while campaigning.
And now for the latest move, China is
pushing the Hong Kong Government to
pass what they call the new national
security law—a law that would allow
them to arrest political critics and op-
ponents. If this passes, if that happens,
that is the very definition of control
and de facto proof of all loss of auton-
omy.
By the way, China is also pushing for
something very ominous. They call it
patriotic education. What China is
really pushing for in Hong Kong is
moving from ‘‘one country, two sys-
tems’’ to ‘‘one country, one system’’—
the Chinese system.
So the bill that we will bring up here
in a moment, with tremendous bipar-
tisan support, requires five quick
things that I will touch on.
First, its most important element is
that it requires the Secretary of State
to annually certify whether Hong Kong
warrants being treated differently than
China. If Hong Kong is no longer au-
tonomous—and that is the rationale
for different treatment—then, they
should no longer receive that treat-
ment.
It says that students in Hong Kong
shouldn’t be barred from entering the
United States or getting a visa to
study here, for example, because they
have been the subject of a politically
motivated arrest or detention.
It says that for the next 7 years, the
Secretary of Commerce is going to re-
port on whether export controls and
sanction laws are being enforced by the
Government of Hong Kong or whether

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6651

China is using Hong Kong as a back
door to evade export controls and sanc-
tions.
It says that if Hong Kong ultimately
returns and passes that extradition bill
that China wants, the President has to
present a plan to protect Americans
from this law.
Last but not least, it mandates that
the President identify and sanction for-
eigners the President determines,
based on credible information, who are
responsible for extraditions, for arbi-
trary detention, for torture, or for
forced confessions inside of Hong Kong
or any other human rights violations
in Hong Kong.
By the way, it would also allow
blocking the assets of these persons if
those assets are located here in the
United States.
So, in a moment here, as we continue
to gather, we are waiting the arrival of
companion legislation.
I yield the floor because I know we
have lot of important sponsors that are
here who want to speak on the subject.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms.
MCSALLY). The Senator from Idaho.
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, first of
all, this is an important step that we
are taking here. This is a matter that
we have been discussing for a long
time. There has been a lot of action on
it, and I want to thank Senator RUBIO
and Senator CARDIN, who are the lead
supporters of this bill and who have, on
behalf of the committee, done yeo-
man’s work getting it together and
getting the bipartisan compromise to
get the language here. Also, virtually
all members of the committee have had
fingerprints on this bill, and so in that
regard, I think it is going to pass quite
handily.
I want to thank the Banking staff,
particularly my colleague from Idaho,
Senator CRAPO, who, of course, has the
expertise—the Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs Committee—on these
kinds of things on sanctions. They
were very helpful in hammering out
the language that we needed for the
sanctions.
I want to thank the Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs Committee
staff, who were helpful.
I want to thank the staff of the For-
eign Relations Committee, who work
for us—both the minority staff, Sen-
ator MENENDEZ’s staff, and my staff,
the majority staff—for doing this and
all of the people who worked on this.
So thank you to all of you.
Since June, millions of people in
Hong Kong have taken to the streets
protesting the erosion of their rights
and freedoms.
Hong Kong was supposed to maintain
a high degree of autonomy after China
regained sovereignty over the territory
in 1997. This wasn’t just a verbal under-
standing. This was in the treaty that
China signed with Great Britain. How-
ever, since that time, China has gradu-
ally chipped away at Hong Kong’s au-
tonomy, and this is now becoming a
real problem.
China now refers to its treaty with
Great Britain as ‘‘a historical docu-
ment,’’ and says it is no longer bound
by its terms. This is just one of many
examples that show that the Chinese
Government has no respect for the rule
of law.
After two decades of broken commit-
ments, it is past time that we hold the
Chinese Communist Party accountable.
What it is doing in Hong Kong is just
wrong.
That is why I am proud to join Sen-
ator RUBIO and Senator CARDIN and all
the others who have had hands on this
bill in bringing the Hong Kong Human
Rights and Democracy Act to the Sen-
ate floor. This bill is the result of a
strong, strong bipartisan consensus
that we must act in support of the
Hong Kong people.
Thank you all for helping. We will
get to the unanimous consent here in a
little bit.
I yield the floor to Senator CARDIN.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let
me first thank Senator RUBIO for his
leadership on this issue and Senator
MENENDEZ and Senator RISCH for their
leadership in our committee and so
many others who have been involved,
because tonight we have a chance to
reaffirm our commitment for human
rights and democracy.
That is exactly what our legislation
does. It recognizes the fact that for 24
consecutive weeks, the people of Hong
Kong have been asking for their basic
democracy and freedom.
On Monday, it was reported—just
yesterday—that police fired 1,458
rounds of tear gas, 1,391 rubber bullets,
325 beanbag rounds, and 265 sponge gre-
nades—that is just yesterday—on
peaceful protesters.
They are asking nothing more than
to exercise the rights they were told
would be protected to express their
views and to be able to have democracy
in Hong Kong, which is the way it was
in the previous time.
Senator RUBIO and I introduced legis-
lation, and the chairman and ranking
member of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, Senator RISCH and Menendez,
joined us, and we passed this bipartisan
legislation on June 13. It reaffirms the
principles set forth in the United
States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992,
which supports democratization,
human rights, and the autonomy of
Hong Kong.
Now, Senator RUBIO already talked
about this, but this is a very important
thing. We gave Hong Kong a special
status in its relationship with the
United States that China does not
enjoy, and we gave them that special
status upon their protecting democ-
racy and human rights in Hong Kong.
That was the commitment.
If they don’t comply with that, this
special status should no longer be
available, and this legislation requires
that we get information on a regular
basis as to whether China is respecting
the rights that we put in our legisla-
tion in 1992, that they notify us on a
regular timeframe. That is an impor-
tant point, because if they don’t, we
shouldn’t give them that protected sta-
tus.
Secondly, it identifies persons who
suppress basic freedoms, similar to the
Magnitsky Act sanctions. Those that
are taking away the human rights of
the people of Hong Kong would be sub-
ject to the same type of visa restric-
tions to visit America and to use our
banking system. That makes a great
deal of sense, and we know that is pret-
ty effective.
So it is time that we back up our
words and our commitment to sup-
porting Hong Kong’s democratization,
human rights, and autonomy with ac-
tion. Let’s make sure the people of
Hong Kong know that the U.S. Con-
gress and the American people stand in
solidarity with them, as the Chinese
authorities, as we speak, are repressing
the legitimate rights of the people of
Hong Kong. We can stand with the peo-
ple of Hong Kong for democracy and
human rights by our actions this
evening.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I
rise in support of the motion that
shortly will be made by our colleague,
the Senator from Florida. I want to
congratulate Senator CARDIN and him
for their leadership in this regard. I ap-
preciate the chairman and myself hav-
ing joined them and moving this expe-
ditiously through the committee, and I
am looking forward to its critical pas-
sage on the floor. Time is of the es-
sence.
The people of Hong Kong are fighting
for their lives. Six months ago, mil-
lions of Hong Kong citizens took to the
streets to peacefully protest the ero-
sion of their democracy and their
rights. Now, half a year later, we find
mounting anger and unrest, with the
violence against students and pro-
testers—most dramatically, in the
crackdown on Hong Kong Polytechnic
University—only getting worse.
People are being shot. Universities
are being burned. The violence per-
petrated by the authorities in Hong
Kong and, by extension, Beijing are
turning the city into a battlefield.
This is not the Hong Kong that any
of us want to see. The special character
of Hong Kong is one of the world’s
great success stories. The vibrancy of
the people of Hong Kong, especially its
young people and the rising generation
of leaders standing up for democracy
and self-governance, should inspire all
of us.
We admire Hong Kong’s success as a
burgeoning economic powerhouse, and
we admire the vibrant and autonomous
civil society and civic life that has
flourished under the ‘‘one country, two
systems’’ principle.
Hong Kong is one of the remarkable
success stories of the Indo-Pacific—one

sionally and to treat its fellow citizens
with respect and restraint. We call for
Beijing and the Hong Kong authorities
to address the noble and legitimate as-
pirations of the people of Hong Kong.
In these turbulent times, the Con-
gress of the United States must lead
with our values. We must stand on the
side of freedom and human dignity, and
we must send a clear and uncompro-
mising statement that America stands
with the people of Hong Kong in their
quest to maintain their self-govern-
ance and autonomy, to safeguard their
human rights, to exercise their demo-
cratic freedom, and to determine their
own future.
The House of Representatives already
passed their version of this bill, and
the situation in Hong Kong grows more
tenuous by the day. That is why the
United States should and must act
today.
I look forward to the passage of this
bill without delay. Let us work to hold
China accountable for the erosion of
democracy in Hong Kong, and let us to-
gether send a message to the people of
Hong Kong that their cries for democ-
racy and freedom have been heard
through both Chambers of the U.S.
Congress, and that America stands
with them in their call for justice and
self-determination.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas.
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, the
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democ-
racy Act is really about promises—
making promises and keeping prom-
ises. Unfortunately, the Chinese Com-
munist Party has a long history of
making promises but not keeping
them.
You can ask a rice farmer from
Stuttgart. You can ask a software pro-
grammer from Fayetteville, a factory
worker from Fort Smith, or a Christian
missionary from Searcy.
In this case, China promised in 1984
that it would uphold the ‘‘one country,
two systems’’ approach to Hong Kong
when it took over in 1997, a promise to
preserve the freedoms that have made
Hong Kong distinctive—the freedom to
practice one’s religion as one sees fit,
to speak one’s mind, and to participate
in the political process.
But that is just another promise they
are on the verge of breaking. Appar-
ently, the ‘‘one country, two systems’’
approach can’t satisfy Beijing’s rapa-
cious appetite. They look at and covet
Hong Kong’s wealth, and they fear and
loathe its freedom, which stands in
shining contrast to the Orwellian op-
pression on the mainland. In fact, they
fear that mainland Chinese might look
across the bay and start to get ideas.
So the Chinese Communist Party has
been breaking its promises to Hong
Kong and to the world, waging a brutal
campaign to absorb Hong Kong into its
dystopian, high-tech dictatorship.
Hongkongers are bravely resisting in
the face of this kind of escalating vio-
lence. In recent days, Hong Kong secu-
rity forces have shot a protestor in the
stomach. They have trapped hundreds
of students in the university, using
rubber bullets and tear gas on them.
They have threatened them with mass
arrest.
Beijing’s propagandists have been
hinting that even harsher measures are
on the way.
An article in the party-controlled
China Daily argues that Beijing must
accelerate Hong Kong’s integration
with the mainland and then reeducate
Hongkongers, just like they are doing
on a mass scale to 1 million Uighurs in
concentration camps in Xinjiang.
I said this in the summer when the
protests started. Let me say it again.
It would be a grave mistake of historic
proportion—surpassing the massacre of
Tiananmen Square—if Beijing were to
impose martial law, occupy, or other-
wise crackdown on Hong Kong.
But the Hong Kong Human Rights
and Democracy Act is about more than
China making and breaking promises.
It is also about the United States fi-
nally enforcing China’s promises.
We have a shot to avert catastrophe,
protect the people of Hong Kong, and
to finally enforce Beijing promises or
hold them accountable for breaking
those promises.
Very soon, the Senate will pass this
legislation on a unanimous, bipartisan
basis to give you a sense of sentiment
in the Congress. This legislation re-
quires the Secretary of State to certify
Hong Kong’s autonomy from the main-
land each year. Otherwise, they will
lose the special privileges that U.S. law
currently grants to Hong Kong.
The bill will freeze the assets and
travel of officials who are responsible
for abducting Hongkongers, like jour-
nalists, booksellers who have been van-
ishing without a trace since 2017, and it
will ensure that pro-democracy pro-
testers cannot be denied visas to the
United States despite their specious ar-
rests. But if the Hong Kong Chinese
Communist Party will simply pull back
from the brink, if they will keep their
promises, if they will respect their one-
country, two-system approach, none of
this will happen.
So Beijing has a promise. Keep its
promises, or give Americans and the
world one more reason to treat China
like an outlaw regime.
Choose wisely, Mr. General Secretary
Xi.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I
want to thank my colleagues, Senators
RUBIO, CARDIN, MENENDEZ, and Rep-
resentative CHRIS SMITH for moving the
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democ-
racy Act in both Chambers, legislation
I was proud to cosponsor. With the sit-
uation deteriorating by the hour in
Hong Kong, the passage of legislation
could not be more timely. I urge my
colleagues in the House to take action
quickly without delay. This bill sends
an important message of bipartisan
support from the U.S. Congress for the
democratic aspirations of the broad
majority of the people of Hong Kong.
Some of you may realize that we,
just a few months ago, celebrated the
30th anniversary of the bloody crack-
down that ended the peaceful democ-
racy movement in Tiananmen Square.
Who among us can forget those riv-
eting weeks during which there was
real hope and possibility of China open-
ing its political system—the Goddess of
Democracy statue modeled after our
own Statue of Liberty—and, sadly, the
jarring image of the protestor that was
standing to try to block the onslaught
of a tank?
The crude propaganda and
disinformation used by Communist
hardliners to brainwash young military
conscripts to turn on their own people
was both heartbreaking and infuri-
ating. Remembering those days, we
must not sit by idly and quietly and
allow Hong Kong’s freedoms to be simi-
larly threatened.
I have been moved by the coura-
geousness of the pro-democracy
protestors in the face of increasingly
excessive use of force by the Hong
Kong police in one of the most vibrant
cities in the world. What exactly are
Hong Kong protesters fighting for—the
freedoms we in America take for grant-
ed every day—the freedom of assembly,
suffrage, speech, due process, and rule
of law. Rather than sitting down with
the protesters, Hong Kong authorities
have increasingly used excessive force
instead of engaging in constructive dia-
logue. Yet, ultimately, I believe the
Hong Kong Government and the pro-
testers are capable of finding a solu-
tion, and I hope they do.
Let me end by appealing to the lead-
ership in China to show the courage to
allow the continued prosperous demo-
cratic autonomy enjoyed by the people
of Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s continued
special status is the sign of strength
and confidence, not weakness.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida.
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to speak about the
greatest threat the United States faces
in the next century, the threat of Com-
munist China.
I have been saying, for months, Com-
munist China is not our friend. They
are stealing our technology; refusing to
open up their markets to foreign goods
as required by the WTO; militarizing
the South China Sea, even after prom-
ising President Obama they wouldn’t;
holding over 1 million Uighurs in pris-
on camps just for their religion; har-
vesting the organs of detainees against
their will; and Communist China is in-
tentionally pushing fentanyl into the
United States, killing Americans every
day.
Communist China continues to strip
the people of Hong Kong of their basic
rights. I was the first Senator to visit

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6653
November 19, 2019
Hong Kong since the protests started
nearly 6 months ago. I had the oppor-
tunity to meet with the protestors—
students, parents, and grandparents—
who are fighting to regain the freedom
they were once promised. I heard their
stories, horrible and frightening stories
of police brutality, threats against in-
dividuals and their families, and mys-
terious disappearances.
Six months in and no signs of Com-
munist China loosening their grip—
their efforts to crack down on the pro-
tests in Hong Kong reflect their com-
mitment to denying basic human
rights and snuffing out any opposition
to their totalitarian goals. We cannot
stay silent. General Secretary of the
Communist Party Xi is trying to be the
dominant world power. It is Hong Kong
now, then it will be Taiwan.
Communist China believes that, in
order for them to be stronger, other
freedom-loving countries must be
weaker. As Communist China becomes
more and more aggressive, we must ask
ourselves: Is this the next Tiananmen
Square? We all remember that famous
image. Times have changed, but one
thing stays the same: Wherever totali-
tarian regimes exist, there will be
brave freedom fighters who will stand
up against injustice and stand for
human rights. That is what we are see-
ing in Hong Kong today.
Beijing soldiers have been appearing
on the city streets, raising questions
about the army’s future role. Will Com-
munist China once again use its mili-
tary might to quash peaceful protests?
Will they once again stand against
those fighting for human rights and de-
mocracy? Will the United States stand
by and allow this to happen?
We are seeing Americans like Mi-
chael Bloomberg putting profits above
human rights and propping up the Chi-
nese Government by continuing to host
huge events in Communist China. It is
time for the world to stand and present
a unified front against Communist Chi-
na’s aggression, and that starts with
supporting the brave people of Hong
Kong.
We must do everything we can to
communicate our commitment to de-
mocracy, freedom, and human rights. I
am proud to stand in support of the
Hong Kong Freedom and Democracy
Act, which will give the United States
more authority to reevaluate Beijing’s
influence on Hong Kong. This bill
makes it clear that General Secretary
of the Communist Party Xi needs to
comply with what China agreed to in
1997. Communist China must give Hong
Kong its autonomy, or the United
States will continue to ramp up pres-
sure on Communist China.
We cannot underestimate this threat.
We must be vigilant. We must be ag-
gressive. America’s role of fighting for
freedom and liberty worldwide depends
on it. The future of our children and
grandchildren depends on it.
To the brave and resilient people of
Hong Kong, the United States is with
you. Your fight will not be in vain, and
it does not go unnoticed.
And to Communist China and Gen-
eral Secretary of the Communist Party
Xi, consider your next moves carefully.
The world is watching.
I won’t stop fighting until America’s
economic and political future—and the
freedom of nations across the globe—is
secure from the threat of China’s influ-
ence.
I want to thank Senator RUBIO and
Senator CARDIN and all Senators of the
U.S. for their support of this bill.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, just
two brief points this evening—the first
is that I am proud to join not only as
a supporter of this measure but as
original cosponsor, and I want to thank
the other Senators—Senator RUBIO, es-
pecially Senator CARDIN, and Senator
RISCH—for their leadership on this
issue, but I want to be clear that we
are here today in this Chamber, and
what we are doing is possible tonight
because of the bravery and the courage
of the protesters in Hong Kong.
Many of them are very young people
who are risking their very lives, taking
to the streets, standing for democracy,
standing for the promises that were
made to them by Beijing many years
ago and fighting for them now, putting
everything on the line. And I just want
to say to those protesters that you are
making a difference, that your lives
have made a difference, and to those
who even now are trapped inside PolyU
in this siege that the Hong Kong police
force has created—this humanitarian
crisis that the Hong Kong police force
has fostered—what you are doing is in-
spiring the world. What you are doing
has moved this body. What you are
doing is changing the world. Thank
you for your courage. Thank you for
your bravery. Thank you for believing
in your city, and thank you for believ-
ing in Hong Kong.
The other thing I would say is that,
while today is a good day in the strug-
gle to preserve the freedoms of this
city and the struggle against a totali-
tarian regime in Beijing, it is not the
last day. Although this step is an im-
portant step that this Chamber takes,
it is not the last step that this Nation
may need to take in order to hold
China to its commitments made in
1984, in order to protect the autonomy
and the liberty of the city of Hong
Kong because, make no mistake, we
are in for a long struggle with Com-
munist China. We are in for a long
struggle with Beijing. We know what
their ambitions are: to dominate Hong
Kong, to dominate Taiwan, to domi-
nate the region and, ultimately, to im-
pose their will on the entire inter-
national system. We are going to have
to stand against that for freedom, for
liberty, for our security and our pros-
perity.
So there is much to do. There is a
long road ahead of us, but today is a
good day, and I hope the people of Hong
Kong will see that the people of the
free world are awake, that they are
with you, and we are ready to stand to-
gether.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to thank Senator RUBIO
for the work that he has done on this a
few minutes earlier. Today, I spoke
about the cause of freedom and how we
are seeing people around the world
stand up for freedom—and, yes, indeed,
we see this in Hong Kong, and it does
inspire us. The message that we are
sending to Beijing is that, indeed, we
are watching and we are paying atten-
tion—and to the Hong Kong protesters,
for them to know that we are watching
what they are doing and that we are
standing with them.
It is important to note that China
has really earned its place atop the list
of the world’s most notorious human
rights violators, and over the past few
weeks, Hong Kong’s descent into chaos
and bloodshed has provided a much-
needed reminder of the horrors, the ab-
solute horrors of authoritarian rule.
There can be no change without ac-
countability, and Beijing needs to
know we are focused on that account-
ability, which is why, today, I am so
pleased to stand with these other Mem-
bers of this Chamber in support of the
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democ-
racy Act. The bill does demand ac-
countability, not only from Beijing but
also from us. It will require us to mon-
itor Hong Kong’s progress toward au-
tonomy and China’s behavior toward
Hong Kong people who choose to exer-
cise their internationally recognized
rights, those rights that we have spo-
ken of in this Chamber today.
The bill will help us identify the tac-
tics Beijing uses to capture Hong
Kong’s dissidents and then to trap
them on mainland China, and we will
also ensure that no peaceful protesters
are denied visas to the United States
because of the alleged crimes.
Now, I will tell you, the bill is a
great start, but the time and the work
that we put in it will be wasted unless
every single Member of this Chamber
makes a commitment to hold us ac-
countable, to hold China accountable. I
would encourage my colleagues to view
their support of this legislation as a
promise to these protesters in Hong
Kong, that their cries for help are not
going to go unanswered.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, today,
brave men and women, boys and girls,
are standing up and demanding that
the Chinese Communist Party protect
Hong Kong’s autonomy, protect free
speech, and defend human rights.
Despite these peaceful protests, the
Chinese Communist Party is fighting
back with brutality and violence. The
police brutality that we have seen and
the Chinese Communist Party’s larger
assault on the people of Hong Kong has

been shameful. Just this past weekend,
the Hong Kong police began attacking
young, innocent students who were
peacefully protesting that brutality.
They were attacked with tear gas and
rubber bullets.
These students’ college campus was
turned into a warzone, where no one
was safe. Today, we have the oppor-
tunity to tell the world, these blatant
human rights attacks and this cam-
paign to bully Hong Kong into submis-
sion are not OK and America won’t
stand for it.
Last month, I traveled to Hong Kong.
I met with many brave men and women
who were standing up. I met with the
dissidents, the pro-democracy pro-
testers who are speaking out for Hong
Kong’s autonomy and free speech and
basic human rights. Along with them, I
dressed in all black to express my soli-
darity with the peaceful protestors who
have taken to the streets.
Right now, in response to that pro-
test, tear gas, sponge grenades, rubber
bullets are being fired at university
campuses in Hong Kong. In Xinjiang
Province, millions of detained Uighurs
and other religious minorities are lan-
guishing in concentration camps, and
across China, Falun Gong practitioners
are captured and murdered so that the
Communist Party can harvest their or-
gans.
Freedom from this brutality and the
tyranny of the Chinese Communist
Party is the battle cry of the dissidents
in Hong Kong. What have they been
waving? American flags. What have
they been singing? The American Na-
tional Anthem—reciting quotations
from our Founding Fathers who risked
everything for freedom in America.
Madam President, I want to thank
Senators RUBIO, CARDIN, RISCH, MENEN-
DEZ, and all the members of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, both Re-
publicans and Democrats who have
joined together. This legislation the
Senate is preparing to pass, the Hong
Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act, is important legislation. It is bi-
partisan legislation. I urge the House
to take it up and pass it and pass it
promptly.
The people in Hong Kong are engaged
in an existential battle for liberty, and
they should know and they will know,
by our actions in just a few moments,
that the people of America stand with
Hong Kong.
I yield the floor.

Kong or in other countries is unacceptable;

(3) the Secretary of State should take any
activities described in paragraph (1) or (2)
into consideration when granting visas for

nalists from the People’s Republic of China

nizations.
SEC. 10. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COMMERCIAL
EXPORTS OF CROWD CONTROL
EQUIPMENT TO HONG KONG.
It is sense of Congress that the Depart-
ment of Commerce, in conjunction with
other relevant Federal departments and
agencies, should consider appropriate adjust-
ments to the current United States export
controls with respect to Hong Kong to pre-
vent the supply of crowd control and surveil-
lance equipment that could be used inappro-
priately in Hong Kong.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
sincerely thank my colleagues. This
has been a great bipartisan moment on
the floor of the Senate for a very im-
portant issue.
I particularly thank my colleagues
from Florida, Senator RUBIO; from
Maryland, Senator CARDIN; from New
Jersey, Senator MENENDEZ; and from
Idaho, Senator RISCH, as well as all the
others who had a hand in this work.
The Senate has just sent a resound-
ing message to the Chinese Communist
Party and President Xi that the United
States stands with the democratic
protestors in Hong Kong. The bipar-
tisan legislation, with the great help of
the chair and ranking members of the
Foreign Relations Committee, will
safeguard Hong Kong’s democracy and
autonomy and hold accountable those
responsible for any human rights
abuses in Hong Kong. The bipartisan
legislation that will soon be offered by
the Senators from Oregon and Texas
will make sure that U.S. companies
don’t sell riot equipment to Hong
Kong.
We have sent a message to President
Xi: Your suppression of freedom,
whether in Hong Kong, in northwest
China, or anywhere else, will not stand.
You cannot be a great leader and you
cannot be a great country when you op-
pose freedom, when you are so brutal
to the people of Hong Kong, young and
old, who are protesting, when you are
so brutal to the Uighurs in northwest
China, and when China is censored so
that Chinese people can’t get the truth.
History has shown that that always
fails, President Xi—always fails.
China has taken dramatic steps back-
ward in the curtailment of freedom.
As my colleagues well know, the pro-
tests in Hong Kong have now taken an
ominous turn. The Hong Kong police—
no doubt at the behest of the Com-
munist Party in Beijing—have under-
taken an increasingly violent crack-
down on student protesters. As the rul-
ing party in Beijing continues to flout
Hong Kong’s judicial independence
while perpetrating a brutal suppression
of minority groups from one end of
China to the other, Americans’ support
for the democratic rights of Hong Kong
citizenry is paramount.
To the people of China: We stand
with you in freedom.
To the kids in Hong Kong, the stu-
dents and the adults: We stand with
you.
To the Uighurs who simply want to
practice their religion: We stand with
you.
Freedom will prevail, and the Chi-
nese system will either change or fail.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
f
PROHIBITING THE COMMERCIAL
EXPORT OF COVERED MUNI-
TIONS ITEMS TO THE HONG
KONG POLICE FORCE
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, on
June 9, the streets of Hong Kong filled
with over 1 million individuals peace-
fully protesting what they saw as an
unjust law and attack on democracy. It
was an incredible visual of people
standing up for democracy and stand-
ing up for human rights.
Here we are 5 months later, and the
images are much different. You would
be forgiven if you saw them and
thought they were in a war zone. Hun-
dreds of student protesters barricaded
themselves in a Hong Kong university
surrounded by armored riot police,
pummeled by rubber bullets and tear
gas, fires raging, destruction, devasta-
tion, and smoke everywhere.
There have been 5 months of pro-
tests, rising anger, and tension. There
have been 5 months of police crack-
downs on peaceful protests, spurring
further protests and resistance, and
U.S.-made, U.S.-exported police equip-
ment being misused by the Hong Kong
police to violate the human rights of
protesters. So far, over 10,000 rounds of
tear gas have been fired into the
crowds of protesters.
We believe in free speech, freedom to
assemble, freedom to protest, not
state-sponsored oppression and vio-
lence. It is time to ban the export of
U.S.-made police equipment to Hong
Kong that is being used to abuse their
human rights. That is why I am so
pleased to introduce, in partnership
with my colleague from Texas, S. 2710,
which prohibits the export of muni-
tions and crowd-control equipment to
the Hong Kong Police Force.
Since the protests in June, over 1,700
Hong Kong residents have been injured
and over 5,000 have been arrested. Am-
nesty International verified incidents
involving the dangerous use of U.S.-
made pepper spray, batons used to beat
protesters, rubber bullets, and tear gas.
One young woman was clubbed from
behind with a police baton and contin-
ued to be beaten even after she was on
the ground with her arms zip-tied be-
hind her.
We have seen tear gas fired into con-
fined spaces, in violation of the U.N.
Basic Principles on the Use of Force
and Firearms. We have seen brutal po-
lice tactics that continued even when
women and men were held in captivity
or in custody. There has been report
after report of violent assaults taking
place inside police stations.
We cannot turn a blind eye. It is time
to stand with the people of Hong Kong
who are demanding a democratic fu-
ture and against the violent suppres-
sion of free speech.
The bill the Senator from Texas and
I have introduced lays out a series of
products that we will no longer export
to the Hong Kong Police Force: tear
gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, foam
and bean bag rounds, pepper balls,
water cannons, handcuffs, shackles,
stun guns, and tasers.
This bill is backed by many col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle. I say
a huge thank-you to Senator MARKEY,
Senator BLACKBURN, Senator LEAHY,
Senator SCOTT, Senator COONS, Senator
WICKER, Senator BLUMENTHAL, Senator
INHOFE, Senator GILLIBRAND, Senator
CARDIN, Senator WYDEN, Senator
BRAUN, Senator GARDNER, and Senator
VAN HOLLEN.
I am really proud to stand here in a
bipartisan representation tonight, to
stand with my colleagues who have in-
troduced the Hong Kong Human Rights
Democracy Act, and to stand together
in a bipartisan fashion to ban the ex-
port of these brutal crowd-control
strategies being misused in Hong Kong
by their police to abuse the protesters.
I turn to my colleague from Texas.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, for
months, the world has watched as the
brave citizens of Hong Kong have sus-
tained protests against China’s dec-
ades-long degradation of their civil lib-
erties.
The U.N. High Commissioner has
found credible evidence of the Hong
Kong Police Force using nonlethal
crowd-control weapons in ways that
violate international norms and stand-
ards. That is why I am proud to sup-
port the bipartisan PROTECT Hong
Kong Act, as described by our col-
league Senator MERKLEY.
The PROTECT Hong Kong Act would
direct the President to ban the
issuance of licenses for commercial ex-
port of riot-control weapons like tear
gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, stun
guns, and tasers to the Hong Kong Po-
lice Force. This ensures that the Hong
Kong pro-democracy protesters are not
subjected to police brutality using
products made in the United States of
America. I am also proud to support
the just-passed Hong Kong Human
Rights and Democracy Act.
I think the statement being made by
the passage of these two pieces of legis-
lation and the presence today of so
many of our colleagues on a bipartisan
basis standing with the people of Hong
Kong against this oppression by their
Communist overlords is very, very sig-
nificant.

States must send a clear message to

CAREER ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President,
when we in Congress are fortunate
enough to win our elections, we then
must take an oath of office. It is quite
simple and straightforward: ‘‘I do sol-
emnly swear that I will support and de-
fend the Constitution of the United
States against all enemies, foreign and
domestic; that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same; that I take
this obligation freely, without any
mental reservation or purpose of eva-
sion, and that I will well and faithfully
discharge the duties of the office on
which I am about to enter. So help me
God’’—defend the Constitution and
faithfully discharge the duties of this
sacred office. Notably, the oath does
not say defend the President over the
rule of law or our constitutional du-
ties.
And yet President Trump has made
crude and inexcusable attacks against
our professional diplomats and mili-
tary officials who bravely and patrioti-
cally tried to abide by this same oath
by upholding these values of honor and
the rule of law. Career professionals
testifying as part of the ongoing im-
peachment inquiry are facing partisan
attacks and even efforts that threaten
their lives and careers. President
Trump has made no secret of his long-
held suspicion of government workers,
which he and his allies have perpet-
ually accused of trying to bring down
his Presidency.
That former U.S. Ambassador to
Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told House
Members that she felt ‘‘threatened’’ by
our own President who called her ‘‘bad
news’’ is despicable. In fact, Trump
even attacked Yovanovitch on Twitter
last week during her powerful public
testimony before the House Intel-
ligence Committee.
There have also been countless base-
less attacks and insulting questions of
loyalty faced by witnesses such as LTC
Alexander Vindman. Vindman, who
was born in Kiev, immigrated to the
U.S. and spent 20 years as an Army of-
ficer, an officer who has shed blood for
our country, as recognized by his Pur-
ple Heart.
Twenty-five years ago, the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was another
longtime Army officer who was born
behind the Iron Curtain. GEN John
Shalikashvili was born in Poland and
moved to Peoria, IL, when he was 16.
Thank goodness he served our country
in a time where his career was not de-
railed by such degrading attacks.
I commend Defense Secretary Esper
for promising that Lieutenant Colonel
Vindman ‘‘shouldn’t have any fear of
retaliation,’’ which only begs the ques-
tion: Why can’t Secretary Pompeo
make the same promise for State De-
partment officials? U.S. diplomats and
military officials put their lives at risk
every day at embassies and conflict
zones around the world. To be attacked
by their own government—and at the
highest levels—defies belief and is be-
neath the offices they hold.
That President Trump and Repub-
licans deride and bully these American
patriots for telling the truth while Sec-
retary Pompeo sits silently on his
hands is simply beyond the pale. It is
the opposite of what we teach our chil-
dren. These career professionals—these

little.
f
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL WOMEN
VETERANS UNITED
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we
celebrated Veterans Day last Monday.
On the 11th day of the 11th month, we
pause to honor the courage and sac-
rifice of our Nation’s veterans. Millions
of Americans have served in uniform
over the years, many of whom return
home with visible and invisible wounds
alike, often to serve again in their
communities.
I had the privilege to meet with a
group of such dedicated veterans re-
cently at a meeting of the National
Women Veterans United in Chicago.
National Women Veterans United is
the only center in Illinois dedicated to
serving women servicemembers and
veterans. Run by women and for
women, I met with founder and presi-
dent, the formidable Rochelle Crump.
Rochelle served in the Army during the
Vietnam era and has a long history of
working with the VA at the Federal,
State, and local levels. Rochelle and
other members of her community in
Chicago noticed that women veterans
were falling through the cracks when it
came to accessing the benefits they
have earned, so they founded National
Women Veterans United in 2005 to help
fill the gap.
The VA reports that there are ap-
proximately 2 million women veterans
in America, reflecting 9 percent of the
total veteran population. By 2045, the
share of female veterans is projected to
double to 18 percent. Women are among
the fastest growing segments of the
veteran population; yet many women
veterans are either not aware of the
benefits afforded to them or they are
frustrated with the VA’s inability to
understand or address the unique needs
of women veterans. For example,
women veterans tend to be older. The
top reported health issues they face are
PTSD, TBI, hypertension, and cardio-
vascular disease, but many also require
services related to unique health needs
such as military sexual trauma and re-
productive health.
Now, the VA has made great strides
over the years to provide for women
veterans, but we must do more, espe-
cially when it comes to changing the
culture at the VA that has often been
a barrier to women seeking care at the
VA. Groups like National Women Vet-
erans United try to break down those
barriers. They have helped hundreds of
women veterans and their families,
providing assistance in navigating the
VA, holding healthcare screenings, and
offering a host of personal and profes-
sional development opportunities and
support groups. National Women Vet-
erans United also supported entire fam-
ilies, such as the Gold Star Robinson-
Wilson family. SGT Simone Robinson
of Robbins, IL, was 21 years old when
she died of wounds sustained while
serving in Afghanistan. At the time,
she had a 2-year-old daughter. National
Women Veterans United has helped
care for the family after the sergeant’s
death. Earlier this year, they named
their beautiful new center after her,
now the SGT Simone A. Robinson Mili-
tary Women Veteran’s Center.
I would like to recognize a few of the
other great women I had the oppor-
tunity to meet during my visit with
National Women Veterans United, in-
cluding two Korean war veterans: Wille
Merine Rouse and Miljan Akin—Rouse
also served again in Iraq, as did her
daughter Rene—Sharon Stokes-Parry,
who served in Iraq with the Marine
Corps; Diane Halle, a retired U.S, Army
master sergeant who later worked at
the Jesse Brown VA and with Team
Rubicon on disaster relief around the
world; Jeannie Adams, a Vietnam Air
Force veteran who serves as their
treasurer; Donna Cooper; Hazel Noble;
Valorie Harris—the list goes on.
I look forward to continuing to work
with National Women Veterans United.
These brave women stood guard for our
freedom in uniform, and now, they con-
tinue to stand in support of their com-
munity—and specifically as African
Americans, some of whom served dur-
ing times of racial segregation, they
faced challenges not only as women,
but as Black women. Now, they help
others who face challenges.
May we use their inspiration—and
the inspiration of all of our veterans—
to find our own ways to sacrifice for
the good of our Nation and our world.
f
THE MIDDLE EAST
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the
Washington Nationals’ upset victory in
the 2019 World Series reminded a good
friend of mine, Rabbi Michael Cohen of
Manchester, VT, of another unforeseen
win. Fifty years ago, the New York
Mets, led by star pitcher Tom Seaver,
and manager—former Brooklyn Dodg-
ers star Gil Hodges—shocked the base-
ball world by defeating the heavily fa-
vored Baltimore Orioles in the fall
classic.
Rabbi Cohen, who has led an exem-
plary life, taking action on major
issues including Mideast peace, anti-
semitism, and other difficult chal-
lenges, sees a common theme in these
two victories, 50 years apart. Life, as in
sports, offers all of us the opportunity
to achieve what at the outset seems in-
surmountable. Peace in the Middle
East is possible. We can end the
scourges of antisemitism, xenophobia,
and racism.
Rabbi Cohen’s words in an article
published in the Jerusalem Post on Oc-
tober 28, 2019, ‘‘Letter from America:
The ‘69 Mets and lessons for today’’ are
a powerful reminder of what we hu-
mans can achieve against the odds.
I ask unanimous consent that Rabbi
Cohen’s writing be printed in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[The Jerusalem Post]
(By Michael M. Cohen, October 28, 2019)
LETTER FROM AMERICA: THE ’69 METS AND
LESSONS FOR TODAY
The articles we read in The Jerusalem Post
and other news sources can be daunting,
leaving us with a feeling of hopelessness and
a debilitating sense that the conditions of
the world are only getting worse.
From the conflict between Israelis and
Palestinians, which seems intractable, to cli-
mate change, to endless strife in the Middle
East, to an assault on the institutions of,
and belief in, democracy, to the worldwide
rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and racism,
to name but a few, the odds appear against
us.
Fifty years ago the New York Mets began
the baseball season with 100 to 1 odds against
the scenario they would win the World Se-
ries. Before the 1969 season they had won a
total of 394 games and lost a staggering 737
games since they first started playing in
1962. A sense of gloom pervaded the team.
But in 1969 they would win 100 games, and
this year’s World Series marks the 50th anni-
versary of the final out in game five against
the favorite and imposing Baltimore Orioles
led by Frank Robinson and Boog Powell.
Baseball and other sports are not only
about wins and losses and statistics. On a
deeper level, sports are a metaphor for life
and a holder of lessons for life. The ’69 Mets
are no different for us today.
The 1969 Season did not begin with a stel-
lar start for the Mets. By the end of May
they were continuing to lose more than win,
with a record of 18–23.
I attended my first major league baseball
game on June 19, when the Mets beat the
Phillies in Philadelphia at the old Connie
Mack Stadium, 6–5. Member of the tribe Art
Shamsky went four for four, including two
home runs, and pitcher Tom Seaver stole
second base!
Three weeks later Seaver would pitch two
outs short of a perfect game against the Chi-
cago Cubs, as the Mets moved within 3 games
of the division-leading Cubs.
Change seemed at hand, but change is rare-
ly perfectly linear. By mid-August the Mets
had fallen 10 games behind the Cubs. But
then the Mets took all the accumulated and
invaluable lessons from the losses of those
previous seasons and applied them to win an
incredible 38 of their last 49 games, and win
the Eastern Division of the National League.
That is the thing about baseball. A good
batting average is .300, which means that
70% of the time a good player fails when he
is at bat. Players will tell you they take all
the lessons from their previous at bats every
time they are in the batter’s box, with most
of those lessons coming from failed experi-
ences.
In addition, baseball is the only sport
where the team on offense, the team at bat,
does not have the ball. Rather, the team on
defense pitches to you. That dynamic makes
the encounter more difficult, but batters
know those are the conditions they operate
within.
The Mets would go on to sweep baseball
legend Hank Aaron and the Atlanta Braves
in the National League playoff series and
then face the Baltimore Orioles in the World
Series. They would win the Series by tenac-
ity, hustle, a strong work ethic, smart base-
ball, and that factor out of our hands, ser-
endipity.
On the second pitch of the first game of the
World Series, Don Buford hit a home run off
Seaver, and the Orioles would go on to win

the game. After that game many felt that an
Orioles sweep of the Mets was a very good
possibility. The tenacious Mets had other
ideas, and went on to win the next four
games in a row to become the champions.
In game two, their oldest member, Ed
Charles, 38, came through, batting, and
helped end the game with a difficult and bril-
liant throw to Donn Clendenon at first base.
Game three was all about two magnificent
running catches by center fielder Tommie
Agee. The first, with two runners on base,
was caught in the webbing of his glove, the
white of the baseball protruding from the
glove, while the second diving catch was
made with the bases loaded.
Game four the Mets won because the cor-
rect call was not made. J.C. Martin bunted
in the bottom of the 10th inning and ran to
first base on the wrong side of the first base
line. Because of that, Oriole pitcher Pete
Richert’s throw hit Martin’s wrist and the
ball rolled to the ground, allowing Rod Gasp-
er to score the winning run. Martin should
have been called out, but he was not.
The final game was won by the Mets be-
cause of smart, creative and detailed think-
ing by Mets manager Gil Hodges. In the bot-
tom of the sixth inning, with the Mets trail-
ing 3–0, Dave McNally’s pitch to Cleon Jones
went low and ended up in the Mets dugout.
Umpire Lou DiMuro ruled the ball had not
hit Jones. Hodges then emerged with the
baseball showing a smudge of shoe polish on
it. Jones was then awarded first base, and
the next batter, Donn Clendenon, would hit a
two-run homer, and the Mets would go on to
win the game, 5–3.
The challenges we face can feel disheart-
ening. We may feel like the Mets before the
’69 season began, when the past suggested 100
to 1 odds against a different and better out-
come. But change did happen. Fifty years
later, that uplifting lesson should not be lost
on us.
We are also reminded of that lesson in the
Bible, where Moses’s last speech to the peo-
ple is a poem. We see in the life of Moses—
who 40 years earlier said to God, ‘‘I have
never been a man of words . . . I am slow of
speech and slow of tongue’’ (Exodus 4:10)—
someone who develops from a poor orator to
a master of prose and poetry.
That which appears to be insurmountable
may be difficult to overcome, but as Babe
Ruth said, ‘‘Never let the fear of striking out
keep you from playing the game.’’ The bat-
ter’s box awaits.

f
OCEAN PLASTIC POLLUTION
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the
world’s oceans serve as a crucial car-
bon sink, a home to hundreds of thou-
sands of known and countless unknown
species of marine life, an essential
source of protein for billions of people,
and a facilitator of billions of dollars
in tourism, fishing, shipping, and other
economic activity. Today, the oceans,
on which life on Earth depends, are
under serious threat.
Threats from climate change, habitat
destruction, illegal, unreported, and
unregulated fishing, and pollution—
plastic waste pollution in particular—
are accelerating and causing poten-
tially irreparable harm to this planet.
I spoke recently on the significant
health, environmental, and economic
impacts of the more than 300 billion
pounds of plastic waste circulating in
the oceans, and on funding in the Sen-
ate version of the fiscal year 2020 De-
partment of State and Foreign Oper-
ations appropriations bill to strength-
en U.S. efforts to address this pollu-
tion.
Today I will further discuss the scale
of the problem and actions that gov-
ernments, nongovernmental organiza-
tions (NGOs), private companies, and
other stakeholders can take to address
this challenge.
I want to share a few findings and
recommendations from a report re-
cently published by Ocean Conservancy
and the Trash Free Seas Alliance, a
global group of companies and NGOs
seeking to reduce and reinvent prod-
ucts and services that contribute to
ocean pollution.
Absent collective action, the report
depicts a bleak future—one involving
more than 550 billion pounds of plastic
waste in the oceans by 2025, clogging
our rivers and waterways, threatening
marine life and seabirds, endangering
human health, contaminating the food
supply, and triggering a significant de-
cline in economic benefits.
For perspective, the amount of plas-
tic entering the oceans each year is
equivalent to dumping a garbage truck
full of plastic into the ocean every
minute of every hour of every day.
That is 1,440 truckloads of plastic per
day, or more than half a million truck-
loads per year. And, of course, this does
not include the immense amounts of
chemical waste and other types of pol-
lution that enter the oceans every day.
As the report describes, rising ocean
plastic pollution is a direct result of
the increasing global production and
use of plastic, which totals more than
750 billion pounds per year, an esti-
mated 40 percent of which is single-use.
Waste management systems, particu-
larly in developing countries, are woe-
fully incapable of managing the grow-
ing quantity of plastic waste.
So the majority of plastic entering
the oceans was never collected as part
of a formal waste management system,
and without increased resources for
waste management programs and im-
provements to collection infrastruc-
ture, developing countries—and the
oceans—will continue to be inundated
with plastic waste.
There is no single solution. Instead,
the report outlines four priority areas
on which to focus our collective efforts:
financing the collection of plastic
waste; reducing the production and use
of single-use plastics; improving design
standards to address nonrecyclable or
difficult to recycle plastics; and in-
creasing the demand for post-consumer
plastics.
One option for increasing resources
to finance the collection of plastic
waste is by charging fees to companies
based on the amount of nonrecyclable
materials used in their products. Such
fees have the potential to generate up
to 75 percent of the resources needed to
support effective waste collection pro-
grams. And increasing the demand for
recycled products—one of the other pri-
ority lines of effort—reportedly has the
potential to reduce the resources need-
ed for such programs by more than 30
percent. Other options for tackling
plastic pollution include a ban on
microplastics, incentive programs for
recycling, preferential procurement
policies, and the use of refillable pack-
aging.
All of this is to say that steps can,
and must, be urgently taken. While
ocean plastic pollution may be a dev-
astating and growing challenge, it is
not an insurmountable one.
And as I have said before, while the
United States should significantly in-
crease our engagement and leadership
on this issue, we cannot solve this
problem alone. There is no greater uni-
fier than the oceans. Their protection
should be of the utmost importance to
governments, companies, and individ-
uals on every continent and in every
country.
f
TRIBUTE TO MAIDA TOWNSEND
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I
would like to take a moment to cele-
brate the achievements of Maida Town-
send, a Vermont State Representative
and now a decorated figure skater, who
recently took home the gold medal in
an international figure skating com-
petition in Lake Placid, NY. Marcelle
and I have known Maida for many
years, and we have always been im-
pressed with her dedication, artistry,
and selflessness. While we have come to
know Maida through her tireless work
for the State of Vermont, we have been
impressed, but not surprised, that she
brings the same dedication to figure
skating, a sport she picked up at the
age of 50.
Maida has served the State of
Vermont over the years through her
leadership as the president of the
Vermont branch of the National Edu-
cation Association, as a chair of the
Vermont Democratic Party, and in re-
cent years as a State representative for
South Burlington. Most noteworthy
though is Maida’s long career as a pub-
lic school teacher, a career in which
she has taught young Vermonters the
French language for well over 30 years.
Maida’s career of public service is ex-
emplary. I know that she will continue
to dedicate herself to Vermont for
many more years to come.
But just as inspiring as her long ca-
reer in public service is her pursuit of
a personal joy and passion, that of fig-
ure skating. Maida, proving it is never
too late to pursue a new joy, is as dedi-
cated to her sport as she is to her ca-
reer. Starting her days hours before
many of us see the sun rise, Maida hits
the ice before she hits the halls of the
State legislature. Maida is a friend, a
true Vermonter, and a true treasure.
Marcelle and I are proud to join her
loved ones in offering a hearty con-
gratulations to Maida Townsend on

this impressive win in one of her many

There being no objection, the mate-

STATE REP WINS GOLD IN INTERNATIONAL
COMPETITION
It was an introduction even Townsend—
Chittenden District 7–4 State representa-
tive—wasn’t expecting to hear. But sure
enough, it’s how she was presented to judges,
the audience and her fellow competitors at
the International Adult Figure Skating
Competition in Lake Placid, N.Y., on Oct.17.
‘‘I confess that it got my attention being
introduced as representing the United States
as opposed to representing my club, which is
what I am used to hearing,’’ Townsend said.
But represent the U.S. she did, as skaters
from around the globe filled the Olympic-size
rink. In her own category, Adult Ladies
Bronze V division—V designating competi-
tors born in 1951 or earlier—Townsend skated
against three other Americans and a Cana-
dian to earn the gold.
As she took to the ice, she noted the
judges’ position and prepared herself for the
music to begin. ‘‘Bumpin’ on Sunset,’’ a Jazz
song by Wes Montgomery, filled the arena. It
was a personal selection, as most of Town-
send’s program music is.
‘‘There is the adage, let the music take
you there,’’ she said. ‘‘It does; you have prac-
ticed so long, over and over again, this music
is part of a person and the music just carried
me.’’
As she left the ice and awaited her score,
Townsend felt great pride. She knew she had
skated well and met her requirements.
‘‘I’m my hardest critic,’’ she said, but
added, ‘‘I knew when I came off the ice that
I’d skated it really well.’’
But getting to victory was no small feat.
Townsend began preparing her program with
her coach, Martha Harding, in early summer.
The two worked an hour each day Tuesday
through Thursday, adding in Fridays the
month before internationals.
The program looked better each week,
until just before internationals.
‘‘For two solid weeks before this competi-
tion, nothing was working right, everything
was falling apart,’’ Townsend said. ‘‘I was
psyching myself out.’’
But getting on the ‘‘storied rink’’ at Lake
Placid—where countless ‘‘greats’’ like the
Russian duo, the Protopopovs, Sonja Henie
and Scott Hamilton have skated—made the
rough practices disappear.
‘‘I got on the ice to do the program and it
was like those two awful weeks never hap-
pened,’’ Townsend said. ‘‘I was in the zone
and it just felt so good.’’
What’s noteworthy about Townsend’s skat-
ing is that it only began 25 years ago, when
she was 50 years old.
Townsend was an avid fan of watching the
elite figure skaters on television.
‘‘I’d find myself just so drawn to it, and of-
tentimes I’d find it so beautiful I was there
crying watching the performances,’’ she said.
When an ad for group skating lessons
stared up at her from the pages of a news-
paper, Townsend knew the message was
meant for her.
Townsend wasn’t fearful about safety when
she hit the ice for the first time. Rather, she
said she was concerned about being the ‘‘tall-
est skater.’’ Figure skating is a sport that
typically attracts a less aged crowd, but
Townsend discovered age is but a number.
She practiced the basics in group lessons,
then found a coach to study under.
With Coach Julie MacDonald’s help, Town-
send honed her skills and grew tremen-
dously. Though Townsend was content to
continue lessons with MacDonald, her coach
saw a greater future for her.
‘‘At a given point in time, Julie [Mac-
Donald] informed me that she needed to kick
me out of the nest,’’ Townsend said. ‘‘I was
very comfortable with Julie and she sensed I
was too comfortable.’’ That’s when Town-
send paired with Harding.
‘‘Martha [Harding] was this really big deal
coach,’’ Townsend recalls. ‘‘I was really
scared, I remember saying to Julia, ’What if
she rejects me?’’’
But Townsend met all of Harding’s require-
ments and the duo has worked well together
ever since.
‘‘Julie knew what she was doing when she
kicked me out of the nest,’’ Townsend said.
‘‘Martha worked with me, understanding as
an older skater my goals are very different
from a kids’.’’
Harding and Townsend spend much of their
time working on ‘‘quality skating.’’ For
Townsend, that means dedicating effort to
flow, posture and working the edges of her
blades.
‘‘To me, skating is when your foot is on
the ice, as opposed to jump, jump, jump,
jump,’’ she said. ‘‘There’s the whole business
of interpreting the music ... if all you’re
doing is going back and forth jump, back and
forth jump, it’s not being one with the
music.’’
Don’t let that fool you, Townsend still gets
some air. In her early years with Harding,
she did all the single jumps—save for the
Axel. Today she does what jumps and spins
her body permits.
And one of her big requirements is looking
confident and competent on the ice. It’s not
uncommon for people who start skating in
their adulthood to be more cautious than
their youthful counterparts, according to
Townsend.
‘‘Adults are more cautious in skating, I
think, than kids are,’’ she said. ‘‘Kids don’t
have so far to fall, kids heal a lot faster than
adults and kids don’t have to go to work the
next day.’’
But Townsend challenges that. In fact,
she’s had judges assume she’s skated for
most of her life. And though Townsend is the
first to say she’s learned a great deal from
Harding, Harding says the feeling is mutual.
‘‘I’ve learned a lot from [Townsend] as far as
being disciplined,’’ Harding said.
Townsend’s disciplined nature keeps her
skating even when the Legislature is in ses-
sion. During the session, she’s up at 3:15 a.m.
to walk her dog and prepare for the day, then
she’s on the ice at 5:45 a.m. and en route to
the Capitol by 6:35 a.m. But skating is good
for both mind and body, Townsend said. Dur-
ing the session it’s a joyful event that can be
‘‘cleansing.’’
‘‘If I didn’t skate I think I’d be a much
older 75 than I am,’’ Townsend said.
That’s why Townsend would recommend
the sport to anyone who’s interested but per-
haps trepidatious to skate.
‘‘You’re not too old to do it. There’s no
reason to be defined by a number,’’ she said.
‘‘I really believe that. I intend to keep skat-
ing ’til my body tells me, ’Stop.’ So far my
body’s nowhere near telling me to stop.’’
f
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I im-
plore the Senate to take up legislation
addressing America’s gun violence epi-
demic. We must pass legislation requir-
ing universal and completed back-
ground checks for individuals seeking
to purchase a gun, to help insure that
guns do not fall into the wrong hands,
with deadly results.
Last week, on the morning of Novem-
ber 14, it was a normal Thursday at
Saugus High School in Santa Clarita,
CA. Just before second period, a 16-
year-old boy pulled a semiautomatic
pistol out of his backpack. In just 16
seconds, he shot five of his classmates,
killing two. A short time later, he
turned the gun on himself.
After hearing the gunshots, Katie
Holt, a teacher at Saugus High School,
rushed students into her classroom and
barricaded the door. One of the injured
girls made it into Holt’s classroom.
Thankfully and incredibly, Holt had a
gunshot wound kit in case of a school
shooting. The girl had been shot twice,
and Holt only had one kit. Holt dressed
the two wounds as best she could with
one kit, while a freshman student ap-
plied pressure. The injured girl sur-
vived.
Katie Holt’s preparedness and quick
action likely saved that young girl’s
life. As we commend her heroic ac-
tions, we have to ask ourselves: How
did we get to this point? How did we
get a place where American teachers
feel obligated to keep gunshot wound
kits in their classrooms?
We also mourn the tragic loss of life
in several other recent mass shootings.
On November 18, three people were
killed outside a Walmart in Duncan,
OK. Just this past weekend, on Novem-
ber 17 in Fresno, CA, 10 individuals
were shot and 4 were killed at a foot-
ball watch party. On October 31 in
Orina, CA, five individuals were killed
and four wounded at a Halloween block
party. And we all remember the hor-
rific spate of mass shootings this sum-
mer, including those in Texas, Ohio,
California, and Virginia, leading to
dozens killed.
In February 2019, the House passed
H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background
Checks Act, by a bipartisan vote of 240–
190. That month, the House also passed
H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background
Checks Act. Since that time, these
bills have languished in the Senate
where the Republican leader refuses to
allow Senate consideration.
By refusing to take up legislation to
require universal and completed back-
ground checks, the Senate is failing
the American people. We have a re-
sponsibility to pass commonsense gun
reform to end the senseless bloodshed.
We need gun reform now, not only to
address our country’s seemingly end-
less cycle of mass shootings, but we
need gun safety legislation now be-
cause our communities are ravaged by
daily gun violence that does not make
news headlines.
On average, about every 13 hours,
someone is killed with a gun in Mary-
land. On average, 656 Marylanders die
from fatal gunshot wounds every year.
Firearms are the first leading cause of

death among children and teens in
Maryland. African-American children
and teens in Maryland are five times as
likely as their White peers to die by
guns. In Maryland, African-Americans
are 16 times as likely to die by gun
homicide as White people.
In 2017, 53 percent of the guns recov-
ered from Maryland crime scenes came
from another State. Often, these guns
used in crimes in Maryland are from
States with more lenient gun control
laws.
American women are 21 times more
likely to be killed with a gun than
women in other high-income countries;
4.5 million women in the United States
have been threatened with a gun by
their current or previous intimate
partner. It has estimated that 900,000
American women have been shot or
shot at by their current or previous in-
timate partner. When there is a gun
present during a domestic violence sit-
uation, a woman’s risk of being killed
goes up 500 percent.
In Maryland, from 2013 to 2017, 48
women were fatally shot by an inti-
mate partner. African-American
women are 1.7 times more likely as
White women to be fatally shot by a
partner. These are women like Mary-
land resident, Timira Hopkins. Hop-
kins’ relationship with her boyfriend
was abusive, and he had made threats
before. One night in 2014, Hopkins’ boy-
friend delivered on his threats, shoot-
ing Hopkins five times before killing
himself. Incredibly, Hopkins survived,
but the right side of her face is para-
lyzed, and she is deaf in one ear. In
September of this year, Hopkins shared
her story on NPR in the hopes she can
help other survivors.
We need to do more for brave women
like Timira Hopkins. We need to join
her in the fight to protect people suf-
fering domestic violence. This body un-
derstands the dangerous potential con-
sequences of domestic violence per-
petrators owning guns. That is why, in
1996, we passed the Lautenberg amend-
ment, banning gun ownership for indi-
viduals convicted of misdemeanor do-
mestic violence. However, without uni-
versal background checks, we can’t ef-
fectively enforce this prohibition and
keep guns out of the hands of violent
abusers.
An estimated 22 percent of U.S. gun
owners purchased their most recent
firearm without a background check.
When background checks are not re-
quired, domestic abusers get ahold of
guns. In 2018, Sara Schmidt was mur-
dered by her husband, who should have
be prohibited from purchasing a fire-
arm because of a domestic violence fel-
ony. Schmidt’s husband purchased the
gun he used to murder Sara from an
online private seller, bypassing back-
ground check requirements.
Passing legislation to expand back-
ground checks to every gun sale, in-
cluding those conducted online, at gun
shows, and through private transfers,
should be the top priority in Congress.
Congress should also make sure that
background checks are fully completed
before a gun sale is finally approved.
There is no one answer which will fix
America’s gun violence epidemic. But
we can’t let the complexity of the prob-
lem paralyze us. We need to take steps
forward.
The American people deserve action.
They are demanding action. An over-
whelming majority of Americans—97
percent—support expanding back-
ground checks. Congress must listen to
the 97 percent of Americans and take
action. We cannot wait any longer.
While we wait, Americans are dying,
and communities are traumatized by
violence. We must do the right thing
and take up the House legislation re-
quiring universal and completed back-
ground checks for individuals seeking
to purchase a gun. The time for action
is now.

CONFIRMATION OF STEVEN J.
MENASHI
Mr. VAN VOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, last week, I voted against Steven
Menashi’s nomination to serve on the
Second Circuit, to the same seat once
held by Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall. Throughout his
legal career, Menashi has shown him-
self to be hostile to women’s rights,
communities of color, and LGBT Amer-
icans.
I am disappointed that my colleagues
have avoided passing important legis-
lation and have solely focused on con-
firming many extremist judges. The
Senate Republican leader has refused
to allow votes on a host of important
legislation, including bills to secure
our elections from foreign interference,
to strengthen background checks, and
to reduce the rate of gun violence in
our communities, and to provide a path
to citizenship for DACA and TPS re-
cipients. All of these bills deserve a
vote, but they are all languishing in
the Senate legislative graveyard.
Menashi has a record of bias and
while at the Department of Education,
has repeatedly supported policies that
hurt students and borrowers. Alongside
Secretary DeVos, Menashi, created an
illegal scheme to deny debt relief to de-
frauded students, including Maryland-
ers. Additionally, Menashi has worked
hand-in-hand with Trump senior advi-
sor Steven Miller to advance cruel poli-
cies that undermine American values.
The American people deserve better
from the U.S. Senate. We should not
have voted on and confirmed this nomi-
nee and instead should be working on
legislation to improve the lives and en-
sure the safety of our constituents.

TRIBUTE TO LARRY WOOTEN
Mr. BURR. Madam President, Sen-
ator THOM TILLIS and I would like to
recognize the distinguished service of a
great North Carolinian. After a 25-year
career with the North Carolina Farm
Bureau, Larry Wooten is stepping aside
as president at the end of this year.
President Wooten has been a steadfast
advocate for agriculture and rural
North Carolina.
Larry has worked tirelessly to ad-
vance initiatives that strengthen and
improve our State’s rural commu-
nities. He is an exemplary servant lead-
er that has always encouraged others
to ‘‘give back’’ to the organizations,
the communities, and the State that
have provided them with opportunities
for growth and advancement. He is a
founding member of the NC Rural Eco-
nomic Development Center where he
served on the board of directors and ex-
ecutive committee. He has also served
with distinction on the American Farm
Bureau Board of Directors, the NC
Board of Agriculture, the Agricultural
Consortium Board, and the Rural Pros-
perity Task Force. He has served as
chair of the American Farm Bureau
Foreign Trade Committee and on
USDA’s Agricultural Policy Advisory
Committee, APAC.
Most significant, however, is the im-
pact Wooten has had on North Carolina
agriculture. In his role as president, he
has been an effective voice for agri-
business and farmers—educating lead-
ers and lawmakers about the State’s
largest economic sector and helping
shape sound State and national policy
for its future. A lifelong farmer from
Pender County, North Carolina, Larry
knows firsthand the positive impact of
a sound agricultural education, re-
search, and extension of that research
onto his farm. Larry was a key
influencer in the inclusion of NC State
University’s Plant Sciences Building in
North Carolina’s Connect NC Bond Ref-
erendum, as well as supporting the uni-
versity’s efforts to create new paths for
more rural students to earn their NC
State degree. Wooten, through his lead-
ership of the Farm Bureau, has been a
tireless supporter of NC A&T State
University’s Small Farms Initiative.
All these efforts will create pathways
for North Carolinians to have an over-
sized positive impact on farming and
economic development in our state and
nation.
Larry Wooten is a remarkable leader
who put the wellbeing of our state and
its citizens above his own. It is through
the work of selfless leaders like Larry
that North Carolina has become a state
where the weak have an opportunity to
grow strong, and the strong can grow
great.

TRIBUTE TO THE HULMAN-

∑ Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I rise

Hulman-George family, to a newly
formed entity to be led by industry leg-
end Roger Penske. This announcement
marks the end of one glorious era, and
the start of another for so many Hoo-
siers and racing fans around the world
who recognize Indianapolis Motor
Speedway as the racing capital of the
world. Beloved as the famous track at
16th and Georgetown in Indianapolis is
today, it is nearly impossible to imag-
ine our capital city without it, which
was nearly the case.
Shortly after World War II, an era in
which the track sat dormant from 1941
through 1945 and fell almost into com-
plete disrepair, a businessman from
Terre Haute stepped up to purchase the
facility with the goal of continuing and
building upon the legacy of the already
famous Indianapolis 500. That business-
man, Anton ‘‘Tony’’ Hulman, Jr., saved
the speedway from either becoming a
housing development or a private auto-
mobile testing facility.
For the last 75 years, Indianapolis
Motor Speedway has been controlled by
Hulman & Company, an entity with a
deep portfolio but nothing as visible
and recognizable worldwide as the
famed racecourse. From the initial
days of owning the facility and pre-
paring it to run the 1946 race to the
celebration of centennial era and be-
yond, the Hulman-George family has
been the steadfast caretaker and pro-
moter of this iconic venue.
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway
has served as the front door to Indian-
apolis, the State of Indiana, and the
entire Midwest for those across the
world who travel each year to person-
ally watch the world’s largest single
day sporting event, the Indianapolis
500, which attracts approximately
350,000 spectators, the NASCAR Brick-
yard 400, and the IndyCar Grand Prix of
Indianapolis. The Speedway has also
recently hosted the Formula One
United States Grand Prix, Red Bull Air
Races, and even a Rolling Stones con-
cert. The economic impact of the Indi-
anapolis Motor Speedway to central In-
diana in the 75 years that the Hulman-
George family has owned the property
is incalculable. The personal impact
the speedway has had on tens of thou-
sands of families who use the facility
as an anchor for what becomes week-
end-long reunions is inspiring, as one
need not search far on Memorial Day
weekend in May to find a family who
has been attending the Indy 500 as a
group for as long as can be remem-
bered.
The facility which started as a test-
ing ground for Indiana’s growing auto-
motive industry in 1909 became a test-
ing ground of speed, endurance,
strength, and the will to win over the
last 110 years. Without the Hulman-
George family, that story would have
likely ended in the 1940s.
Madam President, I want to person-
ally thank the Hulman-George family
for their amazing commitment and
contributions to the State of Indiana
and the Unites States of America. Both
are better because of this family.∑
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RO-

LOUISIANA
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, the
Rotary Club of Lafayette will turn 100
years old in 2020. I would like to share
with you some of the accomplishments
of the club since its founding in 1920.
Early in their history, they underwrote
the election to fund the first public li-
brary, they helped to establish One
Acadiana and started the first Lafay-
ette Boy Scout troop. In addition to es-
tablishing Rotary Park in the 1980s,
they currently fund annual scholar-
ships for local students, coordinate
food drives for FoodNet, and support
Rotary’s mission to eradicate polio
worldwide, in addition to supporting
other local charities.
Congratulations to the Rotary Club
of Lafayette on this historic achieve-

TRIBUTE TO TINA QUIGLEY
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I come forward today to recog-
nize the chief executive officer of the
Regional Transportation Commission
of Southern Nevada, Tina Quigley,
who, after over 14 years of dedicated
service, announced her retirement this
year.
Tina Quigley has been a visionary
during her tenure at the Regional
Transportation Commission of South-
ern Nevada. Her forward thinking and
planning for the future has led the RTC
to be named one of the most efficient
transit providers in the Nation. Her
leadership has helped Southern Nevada
reap the benefits of an advanced trans-
portation system that has helped at-
tract tourists, residents, and new busi-
nesses.
Ms. Quigley has over 25 years of expe-
rience in transportation management.
She has consistently been on the lead-
ing edge of improving how residents,
workers, and visitors travel the Las
Vegas Valley. With a rapidly growing
population of 2.1 million residents and
more than 42 million annual visitors,
that is no small task. Her determina-
tion in pushing for technological ad-
vancements, forging partnerships, and
strategizing for the future have posi-
tioned the region for ongoing and sus-
tained economic growth.
Ms. Quigley is also a licensed pilot
and earned her bachelor of science de-
gree in aviation business and planning
from Embry Riddle Aeronautical Uni-
versity. She is a former manager of one
of the Nation’s busiest airports,
McCarran International Airport, and
has amassed an impressive number of
professional achievements throughout
her career.
The incredible work that Ms. Quigley
has done for Southern Nevada has not
gone unrecognized. She has earned nu-
merous awards for her leadership, inno-
vation, and vision. These awards in-
clude but are not limited to the Woman
of Distinction Award for Government
Services by the National Association of
Women Business Owners, the Carolyn
M. Sparks Founders Award from the
Nevada International Women’s Forum,
and the 2012 Women in Transportation
award from Metro Magazine.
Ms. Quigley has also remembered to
give back to her community and has
directed her energy, passion, and com-
mitment into bettering the Las Vegas
Valley. She serves on a multitude of
boards and committees in Southern Ne-
vada, including as chairperson of the
Desert Research Institute Foundation,
which supports the nonprofit environ-
mental science research branch of the
Nevada System of Higher Education.
Today, I celebrate the many con-
tributions of Tina Quigley to the city
of Las Vegas and to the Southern Ne-
vada community. Her service is as an
example to all of us who wish to inno-
vate, serve, and better our commu-
nities.∑

TRIBUTE TO JAY HILDEBRANDT
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I con-
gratulate Jay Hildebrandt, who is re-
tiring after more than four decades in
news reporting.
Jay has worked for KIFI’s Local
News 8 in Idaho Falls for the past 35
years. As an anchor for the weeknight
news, Jay is known for his calm, gentle
demeanor and steady role delivering
the news. Originally, from Milwaukee,
WI, Jay earned a degree in communica-
tions from Brigham Young University.
Before anchoring for our local news, he
anchored in Twin Falls and Fort
Wayne, IN. Thankfully, he then re-
turned to Idaho, where we have been
blessed with Jay’s reliable, professional
and compassionate reporting all these
years.
His positive influence can be felt
throughout our community. Jay has
made a difference in many lives
through his involvement in impactful
projects and community and statewide
efforts. In addition to anchoring the
weeknight news, Jay produced the
weekly ‘‘Wednesday’s Child’’ reports
for 28 years. Through this project, he
has helped elevate the stories of area
children in need of adoptive homes. He
also highlighted the hard work of re-
markable high school seniors in his
‘‘Distinguished Student’’ series. Addi-
tionally, Jay has served as an adjunct
instructor at Brigham Young Univer-
sity Idaho and helped lead important
efforts, including his service on the
Governor’s Children’s Trust Fund
Board, the Region VII Health and Wel-
fare Advisory Board, and the Safe
Place Advisory Board.
While most of us enjoyed Jay over
the years on the television, there are
those who have been able to work with
him personally. And without exception,
he is admired, emulated and respected
by his coworkers. One of those fortu-
nate individuals is my current chief of
staff in DC, Susan Hawkes Wheeler.

∑ Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I
rise today to pay tribute and to recog-

brating its 25th anniversary, the New
Jersey Community Development Cor-
poration, NJCDC. I wish to take a mo-
ment now to honor NJCDC for the im-
portant work it is doing in the State of
New Jersey and the accomplishments
it has achieved over the past 25 years.
The NJCDC provides hope for a re-
warding future through urban revital-
ization efforts, financial support, edu-
cation initiatives, and job creation.
The work done by NJCDC has directly
transformed the lives of many, espe-
cially in the city of Paterson.
In honor of the accomplishments of
this organization, I ask that a procla-
mation honoring the 25th anniversary
of the NJCDC be printed in the RECORD.
The material follows:
Whereas, the New Jersey Community
Development Corporation is a non-prof-
it community development and social
service agency based in the City of
Paterson, New Jersey;
Whereas, the New Jersey Community
Development Corporation and its dedi-
cated staff empowers individuals to
transform their lives and offers a vari-
ety of programs and services to assist
economically disadvantaged individ-
uals, at-risk youth, and people with
disabilities;
Whereas, the New Jersey Community
Development Corporation has contrib-
uted to the revitalization of the City of
Paterson and the Great Falls Historic
District, helping to ensure a vibrant fu-
ture for the City and its residents; and
Whereas, now as the New Jersey
Community Development Corporation
celebrates its 25th Anniversary, I con-
gratulate its staff and volunteers on
this milestone.
Therefore, in presenting this citation
to the New Jersey Community Devel-
opment Corporation, I, on behalf of the
People of the State of New Jersey here-
by congratulate the New Jersey Com-
munity Development Corporation and

RECOGNIZING HAMMER DOWN
RIVER EXCURSIONS
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, as a
member and former chairman of the
Senate Committee on Small Business
and Entrepreneurship, each month I
recognize and celebrate the American
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting
the success of a small business in my
home State of Idaho. However, in
honor of Veterans Day on November 11,
this month I will honor a veteran-
owned small business for each of the 10
days the Senate is in legislative ses-
sion. The personal sacrifices made by
America’s veterans have protected the
very freedoms and values that give
each of us and our children the ability
to achieve the American dream. The
skills veterans learn as members of the
military are invaluable and undoubt-
edly contribute to Idaho’s flourishing
veteran business community. I am
proud of the sacrifices veterans have
made to protect our country and that
they are choosing Idaho to call home
when they complete their service in
the military.
As your U.S. Senator from the great
State of Idaho, it is my pleasure to rec-
ognize Hammer Down River Excursions
in White Bird as the veteran-owned
Idaho Small Business of the Day for
November 19, 2019.
Hammer Down River Excursions is
owned and operated by U.S. Army vet-
eran Homer Brown. The business offers
guided tours, dinner cruises, and fish-
ing expeditions to showcase Idaho’s
rich, natural beauty in the heart of
Hells Canyon and the Salmon River.
Professional, experienced guides teach
guests how to fish Idaho’s steelhead,
trout, bass, and salmon.
Brown spent his youth fishing and
working along the Salmon River before
entering the Army. After completing
his time of service, Brown got his cap-
tain’s license so he could return to the
Salmon River to work as a jet boat
captain. Brown takes pride in sharing
Idaho’s beauty with his patrons.
Congratulations to Homer Brown and
all of the employees at Hammer Down
River Excursions for being selected as
the Veteran-owned Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the Day for November 19, 2019.
You make our great State proud, and I
look forward to your continued growth
and success.∑

REMEMBERING JIMMY KOIKOS
∑ Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I
rise today to honor the life of James
Bill ‘‘Jimmy’’ Koikos, beloved coowner
of Bessemer’s famous Bright Star res-
taurant. Jimmy passed away on No-
vember 16, 2019, at the age of 81. I had
the honor of knowing Jimmy, as I fre-
quented the Bright Star many times
during his 60 years of running the insti-
tution.
Jimmy was born and raised in Bes-
semer, AL, just miles from the res-
taurant. He attended Arlington School
and then Bessemer High School, where
he played high school football. Jimmy
then attended the University of Ala-
bama until 1959, when a visit from his
mother changed his plans. She in-
formed him of his uncle’s decision to
retire, prompting him to move home to
manage the Bright Star with his fa-
ther, Bill Koikos. Jimmy believed in
the restaurant, and he knew he wanted
to be a part of the Bright Star’s contin-
ued success.
Nine years later, Jimmy’s younger
brother, Nicky, joined him in man-
aging the restaurant. The two brothers
went on to work side-by-side as owner-
operators of the Bright Star until Jim-
my’s death. As his brother fondly re-
membered not long ago, ‘‘He’s the
heart and soul of the restaurant, and
it’s going to be hard to replace that.’’
I will always remember Jimmy for
his kindness and ability to make cus-
tomers feel at home when they visited
the Bright Star. He generously greeted
each person who entered the establish-
ment. He promised his father he would
take care of the restaurant, and that is
exactly what he did.
Because of the hard work of Jimmy
and others who spent their lives de-
voted to the Bright Star, it began to
draw national attention. In 2010, the
James Beard Foundation honored the
Bright Star with an America’s Classics
Award, distinguishing the restaurant
for its timeless appeal and quality food
that reflects the character of the com-
munity.
As a huge Alabama fan, Jimmy was
always ecstatic when the Bright Star
attracted Alabama football coaches
like Bear Bryant, Gene Stallings, and
Nick Saban. He would also frequent
Alabama football practices, bringing
along some of the famous icebox pies
for the coaches, players, and staff.
Jimmy even went as far as to ensure
that the Bright Star would be taken
care of when he was gone, asking a
younger relative, Andreas
Anastassakis, to move to Bessemer and
carry on the legacy of the Bright Star.
Anastassakis was honored.
Jimmy Koikos’s legacy will live on
through the people whose lives he
touched at the Bright Star, in the com-
munity and throughout the entire
State of Alabama. I offer my deepest
condolences to his brother Nick, his

very favorite places, the Bright Star.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE
REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CON-

EMERGENCY THAT WAS ORIGI-
NALLY DECLARED IN EXECU-
TIVE ORDER 13712 OF NOVEMBER
22, 2015, WITH RESPECT TO BU-

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message

States, together with an accompanying

mittee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the
situation in Burundi declared in Execu-
tive Order 13712 of November 22, 2015, is
to continue in effect beyond November
22, 2019.
The situation in Burundi, which has
been marked by killing and other vio-
lence against civilians, unrest, the in-
citement of violence, and significant
political repression, and which threat-
ens the peace, security, and stability of
Burundi and the region, continues to
pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. There-
fore, I have determined that it is nec-
essary to continue the national emer-
gency declared in Executive Order 13712
with respect to the situation in Bu-
rundi.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and
Ms. DUCKWORTH):
S. 2896. A bill to establish the Pull-
man National Historical Park in the
State of Illinois as a unit of the Na-
tional Park System, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 2896
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pullman Na-
tional Historical Park Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) in 1970, the Secretary of the Interior
designated the Pullman Historic District as
a National Historic Landmark District be-
cause of—
(A) the significance of the District to the
labor history, social history, architecture,
and urban planning of the United States; and
(B) the pivotal role of events in the Dis-
trict in creating the first national Labor Day
holiday in the world;
(2) between 1880 and 1884, George M. Pull-
man, owner of the Pullman Palace Car Com-
pany, built the Pullman community, which
was envisioned by Pullman as an industrial
town that would provide employees with—
(A) a model community; and
(B) suitable living conditions;
(3) the town developed by George M. Pull-
man, which consisted of over 1,000 buildings
and homes, was awarded ‘‘The World’s Most
Perfect Town’’ at the International Hygienic
and Pharmaceutical Exposition in 1896;
(4) the Pullman factory site is a true sym-
bol of the historic struggle in the United
States to achieve fair labor practices for the
working class, with the original factory serv-
ing as the catalyst for the first industry-
wide strike in the United States;
(5) in the midst of economic depression in
1894, to protest unsafe conditions and reduc-
tions in pay, Pullman factory workers initi-
ated a strike that—
(A) when taken up as a cause by the Amer-
ican Railway Union, crippled the entire rail
industry;
(B) continued even in the face of a Federal
injunction and a showdown between laborers
and Federal troops that turned violent and
deadly; and
(C) set a national example for the ability of
working people in the United States to
change the existing system in favor of more
just practices for protecting workers rights
and safety;
(6) following the deaths of a number of
workers at the hands of the United States
military and United States Marshals during
the 1894 strike, Congress unanimously voted
to approve rush legislation that created a
national Labor Day holiday, which was
signed into law by President Grover Cleve-
land 6 days after the end of the strike;
(7) the Pullman Palace Car Company also
played an important role in African-Amer-
ican and early civil rights history through
the legacy of the Pullman porters, many of
whom were ex-slaves and employed in a
heavily discriminatory environment imme-
diately following the Civil War;
(8) the Pullman porters, who served dili-
gently between the 1870s and the 1960s, have
been commended for—
(A) their level of service and attention to
detail; and
(B) their contributions to the development
of the African-American middle class;
(9) the information, ideas, and commerce
the Pullman porters carried across the coun-
try while traveling on trains helped to bring
education and wealth to African-American
communities throughout the United States;
(10) the positive role of the Pullman por-
ters in the historical image of the first-class
service that was made available on Pullman
cars is unmistakable;
(11) the Pullman community was the sem-
inal home to the Brotherhood of Sleeping
Car Porters, which—
(A) was founded by civil rights pioneer A.
Philip Randolph in 1925;
(B) was the first African-American labor
union with a collective bargaining agree-
ment;
(C) fought—
(i) against discrimination; and
(ii) in support of just labor practices; and
(D) helped lay the groundwork for what be-
came the great Civil Rights Movement of the
20th Century;
(12) the Pullman community is—
(A) a paramount illustration of the work of
architect Solon Spencer Beman;
(B) a well-preserved example of 19th Cen-
tury community planning, architecture, and
landscape design; and
(C) comprised of a number of historic
structures, including the Administration
Clock Tower Building, Hotel Florence,
Greenstone Church, Market Square, and hun-
dreds of units of rowhouses built for Pullman
workers;
(13) the preservation of the Pullman site
has been threatened by—
(A) plans for demolition in 1960; and
(B) a fire in 1998, which damaged the iconic
clock tower and the rear erecting shops;
(14) the diligent efforts of community orga-
nizations, foundations, nonprofit organiza-
tions, residents, the State, and units of local
government in the restoration and preserva-
tion of the District after the 1998 fire were
vital to the protection of the Pullman site;
(15) due to the historic and architectural
significance of the District, the District is
designated as—
(A) a registered National Historic Land-
mark District;
(B) an Illinois State Landmark; and
(C) a City of Chicago Landmark District;
and
(16) the preservation, enhancement, eco-
nomic, and tourism potential and manage-
ment of the important historic and architec-
tural resources of the Park requires coopera-
tion and partnerships from among local
property owners, the Federal Government,
the State, units of local government, the pri-
vate and nonprofit sectors, and the more
than 100 civic organizations that have ex-
pressed support for community preservation
through the establishment of the Pullman
National Historical Park.

SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
There are authorized to be appropriated
such sums as are necessary to carry out this
Act.
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and
Mrs. SHAHEEN):
S. 2901. A bill to establish within the
Office of the Secretary of Health and
Human Services a special task force on
ensuring Medicare beneficiary access
to innovative diabetes technologies
and services; to the Committee on Fi-
nance.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
today to introduce legislation with my
fellow co-chair of the Senate Diabetes
Caucus, Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN,
which would improve access to innova-
tive diabetes technologies. Our bill, the
Improving Medicare Beneficiary Access
to Innovative Diabetes Technologies
Act, would create a special task force
at the Department of Health and
Human Services to examine and ad-
dress barriers that seniors face in ac-
cessing the latest diabetes manage-
ment technologies.
Since I founded the bipartisan Senate
Diabetes Caucus in 1997 Federal fund-
ing for diabetes research has tripled
from $319 million to more than $1 bil-
lion last year, and these research dol-
lars are yielding results. This past
summer, the Aging Committee held a
hearing in conjunction with the Juve-
nile Diabetes Research Foundation’s
Children’s Congress titled ‘‘Redefining
Reality: How the Special Diabetes Pro-
gram is Changing the Lives of Ameri-
cans with Type 1 Diabetes.’’ We heard
compelling testimony from Dr. Griffin
P. Rodgers, Director of the National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases, and JDRF President
and CEO Dr. Aaron Kowalski on the
pipeline from private-public research
to commercially available products.
New diabetes technologies—such as
the artificial pancreas and implantable
continuous glucose monitoring sys-
tems—allow diabetes patients to better
manage and improve glycemic control,
assess needed therapy on a timely
basis, and adhere to treatment regi-
mens. These technological advances
make diabetes easier to manage. The
market arrival of cutting-edge diabetes
technologies, however, does not imme-
diately benefit patients if our nation’s
seniors are unable to afford them.
As Chairman of the Aging Com-
mittee, I have heard from numerous
seniors who, when transitioning from
employer-provided insurance to Medi-
care, were shocked to learn that the
technologies they have relied upon for
years to manage their diabetes are no
longer covered. For example, one Main-
er was unfortunately met with the re-
ality that Medicare’s coverage denial
of a particular sensor he needs for his
insulin pump means paying up to $8,000
out-of-pocket each year if he wants to
continue with his current treatment
regimen. He wrote, ‘‘Because I am now
65, I am denied care that was available
when I was 64.’’ He continued, ‘‘This
approach not only puts me at risk but
is quite likely not cost effective. While
the sensors are expensive, the cost of
ambulance calls and hospitalizations
. . . is certainly more.’’
I couldn’t agree more. To better sup-
port adoption of these technologies,
our bill would require HHS to create a
special task force on coverage and pay-
ment for innovative diabetes tech-
nologies that would bring all stake-
holders—from patients to device manu-
facturers to government officials who
are making coverage decisions—to the
same table. The Task Force would
identify and plan for changes in Medi-
care coverage and payment policies to
ensure that Medicare beneficiaries
have access to innovative diabetes
technologies that are currently avail-
able, as well as those that are in the
pipeline. The Task Force would also be
tasked with developing strategies for
supporting adoption of these tech-
nologies.
This effort builds on my past advo-
cacy with Senator SHAHEEN to improve
the day-to-day life of individuals with
diabetes by improving coverage of in-
novative diabetes technologies. In Jan-
uary 2017, in response to our bipartisan
effort, CMS first approved the use of
continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).
We also successfully urged CMS last
year to support the use of smartphone
apps in conjunction with CGMs. These
proven, lifesaving devices are relied
upon by people with diabetes to provide
them with real-time measurements of
their glucose levels. This information
is key to preventing costly—and some-
times deadly—diabetes complications.
While I am pleased our advocacy has
helped spur these policy changes, I re-
main frustrated with the pace at which
Medicare lags behind commercial in-
surers. Greater adoption of new diabe-
tes technologies can literally change
our country’s future with regard to ad-
dressing the explosive growth in the fi-
nancial and human tolls of diabetes.
Diabetes accounts for an exorbitant
one in three dollars in Medicare spend-
ing. It is paramount that we encourage
HHS to adopt a more cost-effective ap-
proach to treating this chronic disease
that affects more than 30 million
Americans.
The Improving Medicare Beneficiary
Access to Innovative Diabetes Tech-
nologies Act encourages a proactive ap-
proach to diabetes technology coverage
and payment, and I encourage my col-
leagues to support its adoption.
Thank you, Mr. President.

aptly, the ‘‘Equality State’’;
Whereas the official State motto of Wyo-
ming is ‘‘Equal Rights’’;
Whereas, at the founding of the United
States, the inherent right of women to vote
and participate in the political process was
inhibited;
Whereas the contributions of women to the
fight for the independence, founding, and rise
to prominence of the United States were ex-
tensive, vital to those objectives, and worthy
of recognition;
Whereas women, like all persons, have al-
ways inherently held the right to vote and
participate in government;

Territory was the first government to explic-
itly acknowledge and affirm the inherent
right of women to vote and to hold office;
Whereas the Wyoming Territory granted
women the right to vote more than 20 years
before Wyoming became the 44th State ad-
mitted to the Union;
Whereas, when Congress invited Wyoming
to join the Union and demanded that wom-
en’s suffrage be revoked, the Wyoming Legis-
lature said, ‘‘We will remain out of the
Union one hundred years rather than come
in without the women’’;

Gardner Swain became the first woman in
the world to cast a ballot after being granted

of Jackson, Wyoming, elected a city council
composed entirely of women, the first all-

Whereas the United States did not endorse
women’s suffrage until 1920, with the ratifi-
cation of the 19th Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States, 50 years after
Wyoming;
Whereas the decision of the people of Wyo-
ming to endorse women’s suffrage dem-
onstrates the foresight, bravery, individ-
ualism, and honesty of the citizens of Wyo-
ming and the staunch adherence of the citi-
zens of Wyoming to the storied ‘‘Code of the

lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to:
S. RES. 431
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (referred to in
this preamble as the ‘‘CDC’’)—
(1) 30,300,000 individuals in the United
States have diabetes; and
(2) an estimated 84,100,000 individuals in
the United States who are 18 years of age or
older have prediabetes;
Whereas diabetes is a serious chronic con-
dition that affects individuals of every age,
race, ethnicity, and income level;
Whereas the CDC reports that—
(1) Hispanic Americans, African Ameri-
cans, Asian Americans, and Native Ameri-
cans are disproportionately affected by dia-
betes and suffer from the disease at much
higher rates than the general population of
the United States; and
(2) 23.8 percent of individuals with diabetes
in the United States have not been diagnosed
with the disease;
Whereas, according to the CDC—
(1) an individual who is 20 years of age or
older is diagnosed with diabetes every 21 sec-
onds;
(2) the prevalence of diabetes in the United
States increased more than threefold be-
tween 1990 and 2015; and

or older, have diabetes;
Whereas the risk of developing diabetes at
some point in life is 40 percent for adults in
the United States;
Whereas, after accounting for the dif-
ference of the average age of each popu-
lation, data surveying adults in the United
States between 2013 and 2015 indicates that

SENATE RESOLUTION 432—DESIG-
NATING NOVEMBER 2019 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL COLLEGE APPLICATION
MONTH’’
Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. SCOTT of
South Carolina, Mr. CARPER, and Ms.
ERNST) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed
to:
S. RES. 432
Whereas equality of opportunity for all
people is one of the noblest aspirations of the
United States;
Whereas the National Center for Education
Statistics reports that the employment rate
for young adults with a bachelor’s degree
and the employment rate for young adults
whose highest credential is a high school di-
ploma differ by 14 percentage points;
Whereas a 2015 study by Georgetown Uni-
versity identified that the average lifetime
earnings gap between college graduates and
individuals with only a high school diploma
is $1,000,000;
Whereas the Pew Economic Mobility
Project finds that whether a child born in
the lowest income quintile obtains a 4-year
degree or higher credential is associated
with—
(1) an approximately 70 percent difference
in the probability of that child earning an
income outside the lowest income quintile;
and
(2) a threefold difference in the probability
of that child going on to earn an income in
the highest income quintile;
Whereas the Education Commission of the
States highlights that the number of non-
traditional students at colleges and univer-
sities is expected to rise 65 percent faster
than the number of traditional students dur-
ing the 15-year period ending in 2024;
Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics re-
ports that approximately 31 percent of high
school graduates in 2018 did not matriculate
to an institution of higher education the fol-
lowing fall semester, representing little
change in the college enrollment of new high
school graduates from the prior year;
Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics
also reports that the unemployment rate for
recent high school graduates not enrolled in
college in the fall semester of 2018 was 18.6
percent, significantly higher than the na-
tional unemployment rate;
Whereas many secondary students struggle
to identify and assess postsecondary options
due to a number of factors, including insuffi-
cient information on programmatic out-
comes and difficulties in accessing effective
or consistent counseling services and re-
sources;
Whereas the complexity of financial aid
systems and processes, rising college costs,
and a shortage of effective financial edu-
cation and literacy programs can serve as
additional deterrents or barriers for students
and families as they assess the viability of
higher education programs as a postsec-
ondary option;
Whereas the United States built a thriving
middle class in part by nurturing the poten-
tial for colleges and universities to provide
avenues to economic opportunity;
Whereas the data on the benefits of higher
education demonstrate that, in spite of ongo-
ing barriers to access and student success,
colleges and universities can still provide
pathways to economic opportunity; and
Whereas completion of the Free Applica-
tion for Federal Student Aid is one of the
best predictors of future college enrollment,
as high school seniors who complete the
form are 63 percent more likely to begin
postsecondary education: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates November 2019 as ‘‘National
College Application Month’’;
(2) encourages the people of the United
States to—
(A) evaluate options for pursuing higher
education;
(B) submit a Free Application for Federal
Student Aid to understand college financing
opportunities; and
(C) support every student, regardless of the
background or resources of the student, in
obtaining the skills and knowledge needed to
thrive;
(3) supports efforts to better assist low-in-
come and first generation students through-
out the financial aid and college application
process;
(4) urges public officials, educators, par-
ents, students, and communities in the
United States to observe National College
Application Month with appropriate activi-
ties and programs designed to encourage stu-
dents to consider, research, and apply to col-
lege and for financial aid; and
(5) commends teachers, counselors, men-
tors, and parents who support students
throughout the college application process,
as well as the organizations and institutions
partnering to eliminate barriers to higher
education.

Whereas Blue Star Mothers pack and ship
thousands of care packages every year to
members of the Armed Forces deployed over-

Whereas Blue Star Mothers promote the
values of the United States, demonstrate a
patriotic spirit, and advance a national sense
of pride and appreciation for the men and

TRIBUTE TO KODI LEE
HON. KEN CALVERT
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor and pay tribute to an individual from
Riverside County and the 42nd Congressional
District who has inspired people around the
country. On September 18, 2019, Kodi Lee
from Lake Elsinore, California was named as
the winner of the NBC talent show competition
‘‘America’s Got Talent.’’
Kodi’s voice is amazing. His life story is
even more extraordinary. Kodi was born le-
gally blind and diagnosed with autism when he
was four years old. Yet, when he was just two
years old, Kodi’s musical talents began to
shine after his father tapped out ‘‘Mary Had a
Little Lamb’’ on a toy piano and he imme-
diately played it back. At the age of three,
Kodi was already replicating tunes he heard
on a real piano. Throughout his childhood,
music became an essential form of therapy for
Kodi and provided a unique form of treatment
for his autism. It was determined that Kodi has
an audio photographic memory, in which he
can recall music he hears after just one listen.
Incredibly, Kodi started to perform publicly at
the age of six and has sung and played the
piano at over 200 charity events and in Korea,
China and Japan.
As a contestant in the America’s Got Talent
competition, Kodi drew instant attention in May
by singing the Donny Hathaway version of ‘‘A
Song For You.’’ Later in the competition, Kodi
earned a spot in the semi-finals with a memo-
rable rendition of Simon and Garfunkel’s
‘‘Bridge Over Troubled Water.’’ During the
competition’s finale, Kodi earned the top prize
thanks to an inspired performance of Freya
Riding’s ‘‘Lost Without You,’’ that drew a
standing ovation from both the fans and
judges.
It’s hard to think of anyone who has rep-
resented our region as well as Kodi Lee has
on an worldwide stage. To say Lake Elsinore
and Riverside County is proud of Kodi and all
that he has accomplished is a tremendous un-
derstatement. To conclude, Madam Speaker I
want to thank Kodi for inspiring us and con-
gratulate him on winning the America’s Got
Talent competition.

RECOGNIZING MASON STIMATZE
OF BOZEMAN
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Mason Stimatze of Bozeman
for his quick thinking and bravery that saved
his family.
In the early hours of a June morning, Mason
woke up to the sound of crackling and the
smell of smoke. He looked out his bedroom
door and saw fire. The flames in the hallway
blocked his path to his parents’ bedroom.
Mason ran outside and started banging on his
parents’ bedroom window. Mason’s father, Na-
than, and mother, Sabrina, woke up, broke the
window, and safely climbed outside.
Mason’s brother and sister, however, were
still in their home. Mason and his parents ran
to their bedroom window and got them out
safely.
Mason’s swift actions saved what is irre-
placeable—family. His father said if it wasn’t
for Mason alerting them quickly to the danger,
the story would have had a tragic ending.
For someone to have the presence of mind
to act calmly and swiftly in such a tense mo-
ment is remarkable. For a ten-year-old to do
it, is amazing. His family calls him a hero, and
I couldn’t agree more.
Madam Speaker, for saving his family’s life
through his bravery and quick thinking, I rec-
ognize Mason Stimatze for his Spirit of Mon-
tana.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
EDWARD CALLION, JR.
HON. TIM RYAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Edward Callion, Jr., 96, who
passed away on November 3, 2019.
Mr. Callion was a lifelong resident of my dis-
trict and owned and operated Callion’s Con-
struction Company for 50 years before retiring
in 2004. He attended Warren G. Harding High
School and went on to attend Youngstown
College, Sharon Brick Laying School, and
A.T.E.S. School of Drafting. Mr. Callion was
also a member of the Community Church of
God in Christ and was inducted in the Africa
American Achievers Hall of Fame. In his free
time Mr. Callion enjoyed boxing, traveling, and
watching sports.
Mr. Callion served our country during World
War II as a Technician 4th Grade, from the
3420th Quartermaster Trucking Company.
While serving proudly in both Normandy,
France and Central Europe, he received the
Victory Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Amer-
ican Theatre Service Medal, and EAME Serv-
ice Medal. In addition to these honors, Mr.
Callion also received 5 Bronze stars for his
service.
He is survived by a full and loving family in-
cluding his sons, Edward and Timothy Callion;
his daughter, Mrs. Edith Lindsay; his sisters,
Ms. Gladys Davenport and Ms. Leola Maxine
Morgan Frazier, and 3 step-children, 7 grand-
children, and 12 great grandchildren.
I admire his dedication to his work and his
commitment to family, and I am proud to have
had Mr. Callion as a member of my district.
My deepest condolences go out to the Callion
family, and all whose lives were touched by
Edward. He will live on in the hearts and
minds of all that knew him.

CELEBRATING THE 104TH BIRTH-
DAY OF EMERCITY CHAPITAL
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
honor of Ms. Emercity Chapital, a resident of
Detroit, Michigan, who will celebrate her one
hundred fourth birthday on November 29,
2019.
Emercity Chapital is a caring individual who
is an active member of the community. The
matriarch of her family, Ms. Chapital treasures
her time spent with family. She is the proud
parent to her grown children Leonard, Edith,
and Deborah, and loves her many grand-
children and great-grandchildren. Her compas-
sion and kindness towards others has had a
lasting impact on those around her. Her strong
family values are reflected in the life she
leads.
Ms. Chapital maintains an active life, which
can in part, be attributed for her longtime affin-
ity for playing bridge. She began playing orga-
nized bridge when she retired in 1978. She
has especially fond memories of playing the
game with early partners, co-worker Ann
Sweeting, Walter Forbers, and Jimmy Irvin.
Ms. Chapital was an energetic and tireless
player, never pausing for rest or substitution at
the local, sectional and national levels. Her
team achieved success winning seven con-
secutive Knock-Out Championships from 1983
to 1990. Each win propelled the team to a
higher level and the success continued as
they moved throughout the fields.
Ms. Chapital owes her longevity to her ac-
tive lifestyle and lively social life with keeping
her fit and healthy. She has always strived to
uphold her values. She also credits her daddy
with providing her wisdom for life. Sharing the
ritual with her dad from the age of ten onward,
she has a teaspoon of bourbon to start the
day. She feels blessed that she has never had
any major illness and enjoys command of her
faculties.
Please join me in wishing Ms. Emercity
Chapital the happiest of birthdays.

would prohibit the Department of Defense
from deploying strategic assets of the United
States in the Republic of Turkey.
Since the 1960s, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has had a nuclear shar-
ing policy whereby NATO members can host
U.S. nuclear weapons as part of a broader
NATO nuclear posture. Enacted during the
Cold War, this nuclear sharing policy was in-
tended to deter the posture of the Soviet
Union by involving non-nuclear NATO allies
alongside the United States, the United King-
dom, and France.
Turkey, a NATO ally, was once considered
a friend of the United States. In recent years,
however, it has strengthened its alliances with
Russia, Syria, and Iran. Notably, Turkey’s mili-
tary incursion into Syria that targeted U.S.
Kurdish allies and its purchase of advanced
Russian antiaircraft missile systems under-
mine U.S. national security. President
Erdogan’s domestic policies have also be-
come increasingly autocratic, as he has
cracked down on freedom of speech and polit-
ical freedoms. As Turkey develops stronger
relations with geopolitical adversaries to
NATO, it is time to reconsider any future de-
ployment of strategic assets.
Madam Speaker, this bill would prohibit
funds authorized to be appropriated or other-
wise made available for fiscal year 2020 or
any fiscal year thereafter for the Department
of Defense from being obligated or expended
for the future deployment of any strategic as-
sets of the United States in the Republic of
Turkey.
I thank my colleague, Representative Gus
Bilirakis, who is introducing this measure with
me, as well as my colleagues, Representa-
tives JACKIE SPEIER and DARREN SOTO, who
are original cosponsors. I urge my colleagues
in the House Armed Services Committee, and
the rest of my colleagues in the House of
Representatives, for their swift consideration
and support of this urgent and bipartisan legis-
lation.

HONORING THE PUBLIC SERVICE
OF BOBBY KUMAR KALOTEE
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize a constituent dedicated to a life
of service, Dr. Bobby Kumar Kalotee. Dr.
Kalotee has, for decades, worked tirelessly to
serve people in his community, both locally
and abroad.
Dr. Kalotee has lived the American dream.
Born to a poor family in India, Dr. Kalotee
came to America at the age of 21. After years
of hard work as a bus boy and shoe shiner,
Dr. Kalotee was able to save enough money
to start his own business and truly embrace
his entrepreneurial spirit.
Though successful in business, Dr. Kalotee
felt unfulfilled without performing service to
support those around him. For decades, Dr.
Kalotee has promoted health and science on
Long Island and has served on the Board of
Directors of the Nassau University Medical
Center and the Board of the New York Insti-
tute of Technology, where he received an hon-
orary doctorate in science in 2001. He also
was the Chairman of Spartan Health Science
University Saint Lucia, where he received a
doctorate in philosophy in 2016.
Dr. Kalotee is the International Chairman of
Friends for Good Health, a charitable organi-
zation with a mission to bring healthcare pro-
fessionals to places in need all over the world.
On a recent mission to El Salvador, he and
the Friends for Good Health team served over
5,000 people in 4 different cities. For all his
good work, Dr. Kalotee has been recognized
or received awards from over 300 organiza-
tions.
Dr. Kalotee is very active in politics in New
York. Dr. Kalotee was Chairman of Nassau
County Independence Party, Vice-Chairman of
New York State Independence Party and Na-
tional Executive Director of Independence
Party of America. Dr. Kalotee was National
Chairman of Reform Party from 2007 to 2010.
Dr. Kalotee’s commitment to serving others
is representative of the Indian-American com-
munity at large here in the United States.
Throughout my time in public office, I have
seen the Indian-American community in my
district pull together to raise up everyone
around them. In discussions with fellow Mem-
bers of Congress, such as my friends Raja
Krishnamoorthi from Illinois and Carolyn Malo-
ney from New York, we have marveled at the
true dedication of people like Dr. Kalotee to
make our country a better place for all, and I
count myself lucky to have such a man call
my district home.
Dr. Kalotee has been married to his wife for
over 30 years and has 5 children, all of whom
inherited the patriotism of their father.
I commend Dr. Bobby Kumar Kalotee for
everything he has accomplished and wish him
well in all his future endeavors.

COMMEMORATING THE CITY OF
LEBANON, TENNESSEE, ON ITS
BICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY
HON. JOHN W. ROSE
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the City of
Lebanon, Tennessee, in honor of its 200th an-
niversary. Lebanon is the county seat of Wil-
son County, located just east of Nashville.
Lebanon was formed in 1802 and officially
incorporated on November 23, 1819. The
city’s name derives from the area’s countless
Eastern Red Cedar trees, reminiscent of
Mount Lebanon’s famous cedar forests de-
scribed in the Bible.
With approximately 35,000 residents, Leb-
anon demonstrates what it means to be a
tight-knit community. This town was built on a
solid foundation of hard work and family val-
ues, and it has continued to show these un-
wavering attributes over the course of its 200-
year history.
Lebanon is home to a number of sites listed
in the National Register of Historic Places and
is a certified Tennessee Main Street program.
The Historic Public Square maintains its long-
standing charm with beloved sites like the
Capitol Theatre, while still serving as a hub for
industry and business through the Lebanon-
Wilson County Chamber of Commerce, lo-
cated in the heart of the Main Street District.
Countless successful businesses call Leb-
anon ‘‘home,’’ including the corporate head-
quarters of Cracker Barrel, America’s ‘‘Old
Country Store.’’ The city’s many local busi-
nesses benefit from the unique opportunities
afforded through Lebanon’s own Municipal Air-
port, which provides easy access for industry
and trade.
Lebanon is the longtime home of Cum-
berland University, founded in 1842. The four-
year private institution has an enrollment over
2,500 students and 110 academic programs.
The city of Lebanon is also home to Cedars
of Lebanon State Park. The park boasts 1,139
beautiful acres and welcomes visitors from
across the country to enjoy its eight miles of
hiking trails and 117 campsites.
Tennessee’s largest fair, the nationally-
known Wilson County Fair, is hosted in Leb-
anon at the James E. Ward Agriculture Cen-
ter. Families from across Tennessee—and the
entire country—journey to Lebanon to partici-
pate in the annual tradition.
The city is also the proud home of the Wil-
son County Veterans Museum and Plaza,
which forever memorializes those from Wilson
County who have served our great country. A
true treasure, the museum honors the service
of our veterans and preserves countless arti-
facts dating back to World War I.
I hope my House colleagues will join me in
celebrating this bicentennial achievement of
Lebanon, Tennessee. The town and its resi-
dents have continued to show the strong faith
and values of Tennessee since the days when
its first public square was built over the Town
Spring. I wish Lebanon and its citizens much
prosperity and happiness over the next 200
years and beyond.

TRIBUTE FOR NELSON RODRIGUEZ
HON. KAY GRANGER
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the legacy of a leading Fort
Worth Hispanic leader, Mr. Nelson Rodriguez.
Mr. Rodriguez was the founder and owner of
The Nelrod Company of Fort Worth and a
steadfast leader in the development of His-
panic chambers of commerce in Texas and
across the nation. He passed away last month
after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer.
Mr. Rodriguez began his entrepreneurial ca-
reer as a 10-year-old shoe shiner in south
Texas. He worked in the family grocery store
throughout his youth and returned to manage
the family business after completing his bach-
elor’s degree from the University of Texas at
Austin. He went on to run an award-winning
newspaper, as well as organize other entre-
preneurs to form the United States Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce where he became the
first chair and president at the young age of
just 27.
The next year, Nelson moved to Wash-
ington, D.C. following his appointment to serve
in the Reagan administration. During his ten-
ure in our government, he served as the
youngest Senior Executive at the Department
of Commerce, won the Secretarial Achieve-
ment Award at the Department of Transpor-
tation, and the Affordable Housing Award at
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development.

Nelson was a family man, a business man,
and a community man. He was a valuable pio-
neer who helped pave the way for minority
businesses in Fort Worth and across our
country. Nelson and his wife shared 45 years
of marriage together with their four sons, three
daughters, and four grandchildren. He will be
sorely missed by our great city of Fort Worth.

As one of my Legislative Assistants, Greg

nology and telecommunications staffer, and
primary Energy and Commerce Committee ad-
visor, he has also worked each and every day
serving my constituents in Louisiana’s First
Congressional District.
I am grateful to Greg for his years of service

HONORING THE LIFE OF THE LATE
CONGRESSMAN JEROME ‘‘BOB’’
TRAXLER
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise in re-
membrance of the late Representative Jerome
‘‘Bob’’ Traxler, who served honorably in this
House from 1974 to 1993. Bob was laid to
rest this past week. A proud son and rep-
resentative of the Thumb region of Michigan,
including Saginaw, and his hometown of Bay
City, please let me extend my deepest sym-
pathies to his devoted wife, Jean, his daughter
Sarah and son-in-law Christopher, his two
stepchildren Greg and Caroline, and to his
nine grandchildren.
Bob was born and raised in 1931 in
Kawkawlin, Michigan. He earned his under-
graduate degree from Michigan State Univer-
sity in 1953 and subsequently his law degree
from the Detroit College of Law in 1959. Ever
the public servant, he served in the U.S. Army
from 1953 to 1955. After his military service,
he began his law career as the assistant pros-
ecutor in Bay County from 1960 to 1962. He
demonstrated his skill and knowledge of the
law and soon thereafter was elected to the
Michigan House ofRepresentatives, where he
served from 1962 to 1974. During this tenure,
he served as the Majority Leader of the House
from 1965 to 1966. It was during this time he
began to pursue a bill that helped establish
the Michigan Lottery. And with this legislative
action, so came his nickname ‘‘Bingo Bob’’.
Bob was elected to the United States Con-
gress after winning a special election in April
of 1974. He arrived in Washington, D.C. in the
midst of the Watergate scandal that was shak-
ing the nation. I believe that as a witness to
such a troubling time in our republic; it re-
sulted in his development into a successful
Congressman. He recognized that the purpose
of Congress was to represent and help his fel-
low constituents, to echo their voices so the
concerns of all were heard throughout the
halls of Congress.
During his eighteen-year tenure in the
House of Representatives, Bob tirelessly
served the people in his district. He loved
interacting with them whenever he was home
to the point where it was not work for him. His
example is one from which all in Congress
could learn. He rose through the Committee
ranks, gaining respect from House Leadership
and colleagues, and eventually served on the
exclusive House Appropriations Committee as
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Veterans’
Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and
Independent Agencies. Through his work on
the Committee, he was able to advance
projects in his district such as the EPA re-
search vessel named the ‘‘Lake Guardian’’.
His wide ranging interests asserted that NASA
had a champion for the Hubble Telescope,
that veterans were cared for, that local com-
munities received back from the federal gov-
ernment their community development alloca-
tions, and that Michigan State agricultural in-
terests were defended in the Farm Bills. After
years of dutiful service, Bob retired in 1993.
As his colleague for ten years, I learned a
great deal from Bob. He took the time to illus-
trate what the position entailed and how very
important it was to remember who sent a
Member to Congress. He often reflected on
the power imbalance in U.S. society and
worked to give a greater voice for people of
ordinary means. After retirement, Rep. Traxler
went on to support his alma mater by serving
on the Michigan State University Board of
Trustees and the Mackinac Island Park Com-
mission. Though Bob was an MSU Spartan
and I, a Wisconsin Badger and Michigan Wol-
verine, he and I were dear colleagues and
more importantly, dear friends. He tutored me
in the intricacies of the appropriations process,
for which I shall always be grateful. Particu-
larly because our region has a tougher lift
when competing for federal attention.
I hope it is of some comfort to his loved
ones, and to the people that he represented,
that his being and indefatigable spirit are now
freed from Earth’s binds; may his soul rise
high and shower our precious world with
peace, justice, and good humor from sea to
shining sea.
With a heavy heart, golden memories, and
abiding appreciation, may I extend my deepest
gratitude for the life of Congressman Bob
Traxler of Bay City, Michigan, and to his family
and the people of Michigan he loved and
treasured so dearly, for sharing him with our
nation.

LONGEST-SERVING CALIFORNIA
ASSEMBLY CHIEF CLERK E.
DOTSON WILSON
HON. KAREN BASS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I would like to
recognize Mr. E. Dotson Wilson, retiring after
a 40-year career with the California State As-
sembly, the longest-serving Chief Clerk in the
history of that body.
Over his long career, Mr. Wilson has proven
his passion for service and for improving gov-
ernance. We all know that the smooth func-
tioning of the people’s elected representatives
depends on a well-trained staff operating at a
leadership level within the Capitol. Mr. Wilson
made it his mission to assure that, whatever
the political discussion, legislators had what
they needed to do their jobs. The fact that he
has been unanimously affirmed as Chief Clerk
for every Assembly session since his selection
for the post in 1992 is a testament to the es-
teem in which he has been held by the 482
different legislators who have served during
his 27-year tenure.
The Chief Clerk serves as the chief parlia-
mentarian of the 80-member California As-
sembly and is responsible for publishing the
official documents of the House; and keeping
all the bills, papers, and records of the pro-
ceedings of the Assembly. Mr. Wilson not only
produced legislative materials to assist Mem-
bers and legislative staff, but he created train-
ing videos, annotated guides and a book on
California’s Legislature. These materials are
invaluable both to new legislators and to ev-
eryone wishing to understand how their gov-
ernment works.
Prior to serving as the Chief Clerk, Mr. Wil-
son served under Assembly Speaker Willie L.
Brown Jr., first as an Assembly Fellow from
October 1979 to 1980, then as his Special As-
sistant. Speaker Brown nominated Mr. Wilson
to be Chief Clerk of the Assembly in 1992,
and he was reelected 14 times.
Mr. Wilson saw first-hand the impact of
housing discrimination and other injustices
growing up in the Bay Area city of Albany,
California. The trials he saw his family endure
propelled him to seek change, and resulted in
a lifetime of public service. Mr. Wilson has
worked on a wide range of legislative issues
over his long career, including housing, public
employees, retirement and labor. He took spe-
cial interest in supporting academic success
for California’s youth, including student ath-
letes.
Mr. Wilson exemplifies what it means to be
a public servant. I congratulate him on his
long service and his well-deserved retirement.
It was an honor to serve alongside Mr. Wilson
during my time in the Assembly.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1468 November 19, 2019
INTRODUCTION OF THE PRO-
TECTING CONSUMERS FROM
MARKET MANIPULATION ACT
HON. JESÚS G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCÍA
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I
am proud to introduce the Protecting Con-
sumers from Market Manipulation Act, which
guards against market manipulation in a range
of industries by strengthening the separation
of banking and commerce.
For decades, federal banking regulation has
established a separation between banking and
commerce. This longstanding doctrine—a fun-
damental underpinning of the Bank Holding
Company Act (BHCA)—is spurred by the be-
lief that banks should not use their leverage
as financial actors to game economic out-
comes. Under the doctrine, banks may facili-
tate business through the extension and un-
derwriting of loans, etc., but not through direct
production or sale of goods. Commercial enti-
ties were purposefully walled off from the defi-
nition of banking in order to avoid conflicts of
interests between the actors and operators of
markets.
Now is a crucial moment to strengthen the
separation between banking and commerce,
with tech giants like Facebook, Google, and
Uber moving swiftly into financial services. We
know we can’t trust big monopolies with our fi-
nancial information. The potential for collusion
and manipulation of outcomes is just too
great. This bill will keep tech companies and
other large non-financial companies from de-
riving more than 5 percent of their annual rev-
enue from banking activity.
This bill also shores up the banking/com-
merce separation by limiting commodities
ownership by commercial banks. When the
lines between banking and commerce are
blurred, monopolization and concentration are
usually the result. Working people suffer the
consequences, whether it’s Big Tech under-
mining small businesses or big banks gouging
consumers by manipulating the price of oil,
aluminum, and electricity. We must protect
consumers from big banks and big tech—and
separate banking and commerce.
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this bill.

HON. PETE OLSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, the Holy
Bible, the book of Mark, Chapter 12, Verse 30
says, ‘‘Love your God with all your heart and
with all your soul and with all your mind and
with all of your strength.’’ Those words sum up
Laura Chaffin, her life.
An accident last year in Uganda took her
voice and paralyzed her for a couple of trying
weeks. She was there with her husband Bryan
trying to put their family together. The Chaffin
family is beside me right now. There is Laura,
there is Bryan, and their three sons, Elijah,
David, and Jonah.
If you think Laura felt pity when she was
hurt, you are dead wrong. With a team of ex-
perts at TIRR at Memorial Hermann Hospital,
and with the love of family and the love of
Jesus Christ, she started talking and walking
and teaching at Alvin ISD and cooking for her
family. She became, again, a mom and a wife.

Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with

The Milestone Award is presented to a

Chamber and the entire Lehigh Valley. First
chartered in 1959 to serve the employees of
Western Electric in Allentown, Pennsylvania
as WeAllen Federal Credit Union, the First
Commonwealth Federal Credit Union cele-
brates 60 years of service to the people of
Eastern Pennsylvania this year. In the dec-

Lehigh Valley. Expanding their service to the
people of the Lehigh Valley, FCFCU has

HONORING ALEXANDER C.

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable

tin earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Polit-

as a prosecutor for Claiborne County as well
as an adjunct professor at his alma mater,
Alcorn State University.
In 2006, Mr. Martin received the Legal

the NAACP.
Aside from his career, Mr. Martin has been

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1469
November 19, 2019
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 90TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE DAUGHTERS
OF PENELOPE
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
along with many other colleagues on the Con-
gressional Hellenic Caucus to recognize and
honor the many great deeds of the Daughters
of Penelope on the organization’s 90th Anni-
versary.
The Daughters of Penelope is a preeminent
international women’s service association and
affiliate organization of the American Hellenic
Educational Progressive Association. It was
founded on November 16, 1929 in San Fran-
cisco, California. Today, it is a leading inter-
national organization of women of Hellenic de-
scent and Philhellenes that works to improve
the status and well-being of women and their
families and to empower women to make sig-
nificant contributions to their communities and
our country.
The mission of the Daughters of Penelope
is to promote the ideals of ancient Greece,
philanthropy, education, civic responsibility,
good citizenship, and family and individual ex-
cellence through community service and vol-
unteerism. Over its history, the Daughters of
Penelope has achieved remarkable accom-
plishments. The group has strengthened the
status of women in society, sheltered the el-
derly and victims of domestic violence, edu-
cated our youth, promoted Hellenic heritage,
and raised funds for medical research.
It is hard to ignore the positive impact the
Daughters of Penelope has had in commu-
nities throughout the United States—including
a strong presence in New Jersey’s 6th Con-
gressional District, where I am proud to rep-
resent two chapters, Aulis No. 195 in Asbury
Park and Tethys No. 229 in New Brunswick.
The Daughters of Penelope promotes aware-
ness and provides financial support for many
medical research and charitable organizations
such as the University of Miami Sylvester
Comprehensive Cancer Center (formerly the
Papanicolaou Cancer Center), cancer and
breast cancer research; Thalassemia
(Cooley’s Anemia),
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), Alz-
heimer’s Foundation, American Heart Associa-
tion, Muscular Dystrophy, and many others.
Once again, I offer my sincere congratula-
tions to the Daughters of Penelope for 90
years of incredible service to our country and
its strong promotion of U.S.-Greek and U.S.-
Cypriot relations. May its next 90 years be as
prayerful, fulfilling, and successful as the last.

RECOGNIZING U.S. NAVY
AIRCRAFT CARRIER MONTH
HON. VICKY HARTZLER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the month of November as
National U.S. Navy Aircraft Carrier Month.
Throughout the month, there are dozens of
events and activities all across our country
that highlight the critical role of these mighty
warships in the past, present, and future of
our national defense. I am proud to join in the
celebration of National U.S. Navy Aircraft Car-
rier Month to honor the value, accomplish-
ments, and contributions of U.S. Navy aircraft
carriers, their air wings, and most importantly
the men and women who serve aboard them.
The designation of November as the month
of the year for National U.S. Navy Aircraft Car-
rier month is certainly no accident. In fact, No-
vember is full of historic milestones in the
technological development of the modern nu-
clear-powered aircraft carrier and the contribu-
tions these ships have made to our country.
For example, naval aviation was born when
Eugene Ely launched from the deck of a U.S.
Navy ship in a Curtiss Model D aircraft on No-
vember 14, 1910, some 109 years ago this
month. There are other examples of key naval
aviation events occurring during the month of
November as well, such as the commissioning
of the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (the
USS Enterprise—CVN 65) in November 1961,
the christening of the USS Gerald R. Ford
(CVN 78) in November 2013, and the first ar-
rested landing of the 5th Generation F–35C
Lightning II aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Nimitz (CVN 68) in November 2014.
While not in the month of November, I am
nonetheless looking forward to the christening
of CVN 79 John F. Kennedy next month in
Virginia as the second ship of the Gerald R.
Ford-class of aircraft carriers begins her
march toward commissioning.
Madam Speaker, naval aviation and our
fleet of aircraft carriers have a rich tradition of
service to our nation. Like other components
of our national defense enterprise, aircraft car-
riers are produced by a nationwide team of
more than 2,000 small, mid-sized and large
businesses from 46 states, and 279 congres-
sional districts which contribute parts, serv-
ices, and support to the construction and
maintenance of U.S. Navy aircraft carriers. In
fact, over the past five years, this supply chain
has performed more than $4.1 billion worth of
work for the aircraft carrier program.
Missouri is certainly a key component of this
industrial base and I am proud to represent
my constituents in Missouri who love our
country and our Navy.
I am also proud that my state helps to
produce the F/A–18 Super Hornet in St.
Louis—an aircraft which our carrier air wings
are flying more than any other carrier-based
aircraft on the flight decks of our nation’s 11
aircraft carriers. The Super Hornet is an abso-
lutely integral component of today’s carrier air
wing, and the combination of the air wings and
aircraft carriers in our fleet is a bedrock of our
Navy’s ability to defend freedom, project
power, and protect our national security.
In closing, I am proud to support our Navy,
naval aviation, and the men and women that
serve our nation tirelessly across the nation
and around the world.

ate similar programs. The programs are an im-
portant way to express our appreciation and
gratitude for the significant contributions and
sacrifices made by our veterans.
The Operation Recognition Class of 2019

Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great admiration that I rise today to congratu-
late Blue Mountain Resort in Palmerton, Car-

pion Award.
The Chamber Champion Award is pre-
sented to a successful and esteemed busi-
ness or individual that operates with integrity
and that has been a long-time member and
premier supporter of the Chamber, its mission,
and its goals. Well known as a premier ski
and snowboard destination in Eastern Penn-
sylvania, Blue Mountain Resort began with a
vision and 300 acres of land purchased by
founder Ray Tuthill. Fifteen years later Blue
Mountain, first known as ‘‘Little Gap,’’ began
welcoming visitors to enjoy its first five trails.
Today, Blue Mountain Resort boasts 40 ski
trails, 16 lifts, and 34 tubing lanes, a full-serv-
ice mountain top restaurant, and welcomes
over 500,000 visitors each year. For its incred-
ible growth, success and commitment to the
betterment ofLehigh Valley, Blue Mountain is
truly deserving of this great honor.
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-

RECOGNIZING TATUM DAVID
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Tatum David, a freshman student
from Olney High School, who won the Illinois
Class 2A state cross country race on Novem-
ber 9. Tatum covered the three-mile course in
16 minutes and four seconds. Her blazingly
fast first mile of 5:03 subdued the field as she
established a sizeable lead. She ran the next
two miles in 5:26 and 5:35, respectively, win-
ning the crown in convincing fashion.
The fast first mile reflected the way Tatum
has run all season—go out fast, take a big
lead, exhaust the field, and win. It makes for
a very fast pace overall, and Tatum’ s time set
a Class 2A record.
What might be even more remarkable is
how new Tatum is to the sport. A freshman
with still untapped potential, she also placed
fourth at the Nike Midwest Regional race on
November 16, running against 298 other ath-
letes. Her next event will be on November 29
at the Foot Locker Cross Country Midwest Re-
gional.
Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure I
stand to recognize Tatum David for her suc-
cess, and I would like to extend my best wish-
es to her for a bright future.
HONORING MR. CHAD SHIFFLET
AND THE MOUNTAIN VIEW MID-
DLE SCHOOL ANGEL CLOSET
HON. SCOTT PERRY
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Chad Shifflet for his
exemplary service to the Cumberland Valley
School District as a Security Officer and as
the creator of the Mountain View Middle
School’s Angel Closet, which provides age
and environmentally-appropriate clothing for
children in need.
After a distinguished 23–year career in the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard, Mr. Shifflet
became a Security Officer with the Cum-
berland Valley School District in August. Dur-
ing his orientation with the school district, he
walked through all of its schools and learned
that many children there did not have the
clothing items that they needed in order to
learn and succeed.
When he took up his assignment to the
Mountain View Middle School, he located a
twelve-foot by twelve-foot room that he could
use to distribute clothes to students in need
and established an Angel Closet. Shifflet
partnered with a local consignment shop,
which donated clothing racks and hangers,
and a local drycleaner, which agreed to d1y
clean all winter coats. Local donors keep the
Angel Closet well-stocked with a range of
comfortable and appropriate clothing items
which are available for students who need
them. This has ensured that all Mountain View
Middle School students have access to clean,
comfortable clothing so that they can thrive at
school.
Shifflet’s Angel Closet makes sure that no
clothing donations go to waste, sending
clothes that are too big for middle school stu-
dents to the high school, clothes that are too
small to the elementary school, and clothes
that would not appeal to school-aged children
to the Salvation Army. He hopes to expand
the operation so that every school in the dis-
trict has an Angel Closet and eve1y child has
access to the clothes that they need to excel.
Mr. Shifftlet’s remarkable, lifelong record
ofservice to our Nation, the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, and the Cumberland Valley
community is an example to all. On behalf of
Pennsylvania’s Tenth Congressional District, I
commend and thank Mr. Shifflet and wish him
continued success in his service to the chil-
dren of Cumberland Valley School District.

RECOGNIZING CHAIRMAN OF THE
NATIONAL CHICKEN COUNCIL
CLINT RIVERS
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize a fellow Northeast
Georgian, Mr. Clint Rivers, for being installed
as 2019–2020 Chairman of the National
Chicken Council.
Mr. Rivers currently serves as President and
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Wayne
Farms, but his commitment to the poultry in-
dustry spans over three decades. He first
began his career with Golden West Foods in
Bedford, Virginia after earning his Animal
Science degree from Virginia Polytechnic Insti-
tute and State University. Before being named
President and CEO of Wayne Farms, he
served as Vice President and General Man-
ager of the Fresh Business Unit and was later
promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Prior to
those roles, Mr. Rivers spent 6 years as Presi-
dent of Foodservice and Supply Chain of
Perdue Farms, and 21 years at Pilgrim’s
Pride, where he held the titles of Chief Oper-
ating Officer, President, and Chief Executive
Officer.
After decades of commitment to the poultry
industry and the National Chicken Council, Mr.
Rivers has been chosen to succeed former
Chairman Mark Kaminsky. He was installed as
Chairman during the NCC’s 65th Annual Con-
ference in Washington, D.C., just last month.
On behalf of the Ninth District, I would like
to congratulate Mr. Clint Rivers on his
achievement and thank him for his commit-
ment to the poultry industry. I am confident the
National Chicken Council and the poultry in-
dustry as a whole will flourish under his lead-
ership.

HON. TOM MALINOWSKI
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Ridge High School’s in-
credible work on raising over 50 pounds of
food for the Food Bank Network of Somerset
County, NJ—part of the Trick or Treat so Kids
Can Eat program.
Despite being discontinued in 2018 by the
Educational Theatre Association, the students
and adults of the New Jersey Thespians State
board continued to believe that they must re-
main committed to fight hunger. Thus, New
Jersey Trick or Treat so Kids Can Eat was
born.
New Jersey Thespians is nationally recog-
nized as a Gold Honor Chapter of the Edu-
cational Theatre Association and recognized
as the state’s premier arts honor society. On
top of that, New Jersey has one of the fastest
growing Junior Thespian chapters in the coun-
try, continuing to only double in size every
year. I am proud to represent the remarkable
students at Ridge High School who are not
only Thespians, but are also staunch advo-
cates for fighting hunger in our local New Jer-
sey communities.

Born in Havana, Cuba, Major Doce spent
his childhood in Miami. He is a graduate of
Barry University. In 1984, he joined the Vir-
ginia Gardens Police Department. Five years

Major Doce has worked to serve and protect
the Miami Beach community in various capac-

CONGRATULATING LINDA MILLER
ON HER RETIREMENT
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and appreciation that I rise today
to honor Linda Miller of Tamaqua, who is retir-
ing after serving the good people of Pennsyl-
vania for 38 years in the House of Represent-
atives.
Mrs. Miller has left her mark on our great
Commonwealth as the longest-serving district
office employee in the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives. Mrs. Miller began as a staffer
in Rep. Klingaman’s office on January 16,
1981 and has since worked in other Rep-
resentatives’ offices including Rep. Dave
Argall, and most recently, Rep. Jerry Knowles.
She is a pillar of her community and has com-
mitted nearly two decades to supporting and
serving her friends, neighbors, and fellow citi-
zens. The fabric of our Pennsylvania commu-
nities is strengthened by the selflessness,
compassion, and integrity of our public serv-
ants like Mrs. Miller. She will surely be missed
by the constituents she served and those who
she served alongside.
Although she is culminating an impressive
and impactful career, I am confident that as
she begins this new chapter, she will continue
to be a positive influence and a dedicated
member of our great community.
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania’s Ninth
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to
join me in congratulating Mrs. Miller on her re-
tirement and thank her for her many years of
dedicated service to the Commonwealth of

CONGRATULATING THE YURCONIC
AGENCY ON RECEIPT OF THE
MILESTONE AWARD
HON. DANIEL MEUSER

Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great admiration that I rise today to congratu-
late the Yurconic Agency of Allentown, Penn-
sylvania on receiving the Milestone Award
from the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of
Commerce.
The Milestone Award is presented to a
member of the chamber that has reached a
significant landmark in business, a high point
of superior commitment to the community and
brings a notable measure of pride to the
Chamber and the entire Lehigh Valley. For 50
years, the Yurconic Agency has been an out-
standing insurance agency, serving the Lehigh
Valley. From vehicle registration to driver’s li-
cense services the Yurconic Agency has been
providing a wide array of insurance options to
the greater Lehigh Valley since 1969. The
high quality customer service the Yurconic
Agency has offered has made it a cornerstone
of communities throughout Eastern Pennsyl-
vania.
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-

on this great honor and thank them for their
50 year commitment to the betterment of our

CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE
RELEASE OF AUSTIN TICE
HON. JAMIE RASKIN
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to join my colleagues in calling for the imme-
diate release of award-winning journalist and
veteran Austin Tice. I thank the gentlelady
from the District of Columbia, ELEANOR
HOLMES NORTON, and the gentleman from
Texas, AL GREEN, for their moving words and
their unflagging efforts to secure Austin Tice’s
release.
Austin has been held captive in Syria for
over seven years. He traveled to Syria as a
freelance journalist to cover the war in May
2012. Few journalists were working in Syria at
this time, and his vital reporting and images
appeared in major news sources, including the
Washington Post, Agence France Presse, and
McClatchy Newspapers. Three months later,
he was detained at a check point south of Da-
mascus on his way to Lebanon.
Austin has been missing ever since. Five
weeks after he was taken captive, a 43-sec-
ond video titled ‘‘Austin Tice is Alive’’
emerged, showing a group of unidentified

armed men holding Austin. This was the last
information received from the captors.
Although Austin Tice has spent far too many
days, months, and years in captivity, crucially
the United States government believes Austin
is alive. The FBI is offering a one-million-dollar
reward for information leading directly to his
safe location and return. His parents, Debra
and Marc Tice, have been consistent beacons
of hope throughout Austin’s captivity, working
passionately for his release, and never losing
hope for their son’s safe return. Their love for
their son has had the power to mobilize a
large, bipartisan, bicameral group of Members
of Congress from all over the country. I was
proud to join my colleagues this September in
a letter to President Trump calling for him to
use the full weight of his national security
team to bring Austin home, and I renew that
call now.
Austin Tice has been separated from his
family, friends, and loved ones for far too long.
He has spent too many birthdays in captivity.
I join my colleagues in calling upon those who
are keeping him in Syria to let Austin Tice go.
Let him return safely to his family and his
country.

IN RECOGNITION OF IMAM HAAZIM
FAQUEEH RASHED
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Imam Haazim Faqueeh Rashed,
as his family and the Sacramento community
gather to remember him. Imam Rashed dedi-
cated his life to the advancement of all com-
munities, regardless of faith, in Sacramento. I
ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the
life and legacy of Imam Haazim Rashed.
Imam Haazim Faqueeh Rashed graduated
from Stanford University and attended Yale
University Law School. His professional career
began with progressing economic develop-
ment as a Director for the National Develop-
ment Council. He dedicated himself to the
education of various economic development
professionals and initiated the revitalization of
communities across the nation.
In 1972, Imam Haazim Faqueeh Rashed
converted to Islam and dedicated his life to his
faith and service. In 2003, Imam Rashed
moved to Sacramento and played a
foundational role in establishing Sacramento’s
Masjid As-Sabur and soon became its Imam.
In addition to leading his congregation, he was
involved in numerous organizations and dedi-
cated much of his time to the Sacramento’s
interfaith and community efforts through the
Council of Sacramento Valley Islamic Organi-
zations (COSVIO), Sacramento Area Con-
gregations Together (Sac-ACT) and served on
the Board of CAIR-Sacramento Valley/Central
California.
Imam Haazim Rashed worked tirelessly to
help those in need and was known for his jo-
vial uplifting character. He lifted the spirits of
others and gave his life to helping community
members. Imam Rashed was a devout hus-
band, loving father and doting grandfather. I
offer my deepest condolences to his wife of 46
years, Janice Davis Rashed, his children, ex-
tended family, and his community as Imam
Haazim Rashed has touched the lives of
many.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of
Imam Haazim Faqueeh Rashed, a man who
has dedicated his life to the advancement of
the American Muslim community and all com-
munities in Sacramento. As Imam Haazim
Faqueeh Rashed is being honored with the
2019 Lifetime Achievement Award by the
Council on American-Islamic Relations, I ask
all my colleagues to join me in honoring his
contributions to Sacramento and beyond.

HONORING THE WATER REPLEN-
ISHMENT DISTRICT OF SOUTH-
ERN CALIFORNIA
HON. LINDA T. SÁNCHEZ
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Ms. SÁNCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor one great agency in my district. On No-
vember 17, 2019, the Water Replenishment
District celebrated its 60th Anniversary.
The Water Replenishment District (WRD) is
a groundwater management agency that has
developed innovative projects and programs
for locally sourced, sustainable water to re-
plenish two of the most utilized urban ground-
water basins in the United States. WRD was
established in 1959 in response to unregu-
lated and unmanaged over-pumping of our
aquifers which caused many drinking water
wells to go dry.
Located in Lakewood, California, WRD is
the largest groundwater agency in the State of
California. The district’s service area covers a
420-square-mile region of southern Los Ange-
les County, the most populated county in the
United States. They provide half of the drink-
ing water for 43 cities and over 4 million peo-
ple. Due to WRD’s hard work, that water is
now completely locally sustainable.
These efforts include programs like Water
Independence Now (WIN) and new facilities
like the Albert Robles Center for Water Recy-
cling and Environmental Learning (ARC) in the
City of Pico Rivera. WRD has shown a dedi-
cation to sustainability and a commitment to
providing safe drinking water to residents in its
service area, which includes the majority of
the 38th Congressional District of California.
I am honored to represent districts like WRD
and look forward to what the next 60 years
have in store.

Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great admiration that I rise today to recognize
and congratulate Barbara Green of Lehighton,
Carbon County for being named the recipient
of the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of
Commerce’s Chamber Champion Award.
The Chamber Champion Award is pre-
sented to a successful and esteemed busi-
ness or individual that is well-known to oper-
ate with integrity and that has been a long-
time member and premier supporter of the
Chamber, its mission, and its goals. After
graduating from Lehigh University, Ms. Green
began her career with Ernst & Young where
she supervised audits on manufacturing, con-
struction, health care and insurance clients.
After serving in key management roles at a
variety of companies, Ms. Green began with
Blue Mountain Resort in 1993 as she served
as Controller for 5 years, implementing an in-
novate new ticketing system for the ski area.
After the passing of her father and founder of
Blue Mountain, Mr. Ray Tuthill, Ms. Green re-
turned to Blue Mountain in 2007 to serve in
her current role as President, where she over-
sees a full-year destination that attracts over
500,000 visitors each year. The fabric of our
Pennsylvania communities is made stronger
by the hard work and dedication that Ms.
Green has shown to our community through-
out her career.
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-

ment to our community.

WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP
DAY 2019

Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
speak in honor of Women’s Entrepreneurship
Day which is celebrated around the world
each year on November 19th.
Women are leaders, innovators, and entre-
preneurs that drive economic expansion and
advance communities around the world. Be-
tween 2018 and 2019, U.S. women of all
backgrounds started an average of 1,817 new
businesses per day, representing 42 percent
of all businesses. These businesses generate
$1.9 trillion and employs 9.4 million workers.
5.4 million businesses are owned by women
of color and 99 percent of women-owned busi-
nesses are small businesses. I applaud these
women entrepreneurs and their undeniable im-
pact.
I also applaud Wendy Diamond who has
personally spearheaded the Women’s Entre-
preneurship Day movement. Since her cam-
paign launched in 2013, her Women’s Entre-
preneurship Day organization has funded 500
Syrian refugee girls in Jordan so they could
attend high school, launched an initiative in
Oman to empower women and girls to vote
against arranged marriage, and partnered with
a Uruguayan university to offer scholarships to
young women. Women’s Entrepreneurship
Day is now celebrated in 144 countries and
110 universities and colleges internationally,
with numerous global ambassadors. The
Women’s Entrepreneurship Day mission is to
empower, celebrate, and support women in
business worldwide to alleviate poverty.
On Friday, November 15th, Ms. Diamond
hosted a Women’s Entrepreneurship Day
event in New York City at the United Nations
in order to empower, celebrate, and support
women and girls globally to alleviate poverty.
During this event, Ms. Diamond and her or-
ganization honored the following individuals

INTRODUCTION OF THE
BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS JURY
DUTY EXCLUSION ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to introduce the Breastfeeding Mothers Jury
Duty Exclusion Act of 2019. My bill would
allow breastfeeding mothers summoned for
jury service in federal court or in the Superior
Court of the District of Columbia to be ex-
cused from service for the period they are
breastfeeding an infant. This would be optional
for the mothers. Breastfeeding mothers would
be allowed to serve if they do not wish to take
the exemption. The benefits of breastfeeding
are well-documented, and breastfeeding moth-
ers should not be deterred from breastfeeding
because of a jury summons.
Under the National Capital Revitalization
and Self-Government Improvement Act of
1997 (Pub. L. 105–33), Congress took respon-
sibility for paying for the D.C. courts and other
state-like functions previously provided by
D.C. The D.C. courts, however, have always
been under the control of Congress, even
when they were funded by the District. The
Home Rule Act prohibits the District govern-
ment from enacting any law relating to Title 11
of the D.C. Code. Title 11 establishes the ex-
emptions from jury. Therefore, this bill is nec-
essary to provide this exclusion for both the
federal and D.C. courts.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

BARSTOW CITY COUNCILMEMBER
RICHARD HARPOLE RETIRES
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the retirement of Barstow City
Councilmember Richard Harpole, who de-
parted the dais on November 18, 2019.
Richard Harpole was born on October 8,
1958 in Illinois. He came to Barstow by way
of the United States Army, where he served at
nearby Fort Irwin as a military police investi-
gator. While stationed at Fort Irwin, he met his
wife Donna, and married her in 1984. After his
marriage, he was honorably discharged from
the Army and joined the Barstow Police De-
partment. During his time with the Barstow Po-
lice Department, Richard focused heavily on
combatting gangs and drug trafficking, and is
still a lifetime member of the California Nar-
cotic Officers Association. He retired from the
Barstow Police Department in 2008 as a lieu-
tenant.
After his retirement, Councilmember Harpole
stayed involved in his community. He served
on the board of the Barstow Area Chamber of
Commerce, the Boys & Girls Club of Barstow,
Mojave Valley Volunteer Hospice, and the
Barstow Humane Society. Councilmember
Harpole was elected to the Barstow City
Council in 2012 and won reelection in 2016.
Councilmember Richard Harpole has a his-
tory of serving his community throughout his
life, from his service in the United States Army
and Barstow Police Department to his civic
engagement across numerous boards of direc-
tors and culminating in his service as a Bar-
stow City Councilmember. I congratulate him
on a very well-deserved retirement and will
miss his presence in the City of Barstow.

HONORING IRENE BLESSING
HON. LARRY BUCSHON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 19, 2019
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Irene Blessing, who will be
celebrating her 100th birthday on November
23, 2019. Irene is the oldest living female vet-
eran in Vanderburgh County, having served as
an Army nurse in World War II.
Born the daughter of a World War I Navy
veteran, Irene felt the call to serve her country
after the United States was drawn into World
War II. After enlisting on May 26, 1943, she
made her way to the 228th Army Hospital in
Sherborne, England. Her most trying moments
in the hospital came in the wake of D-Day.
After being woken up by the deafening noise
of airplane engines overhead, Irene and the
rest of the hospital staff began receiving pa-
tients two days later. The incoming flow of pa-
tients was so steady that the hospital hardly
had time to do the laundry. Despite the stress-
ful circumstances, Irene served with distinction
and honor, providing quality care for wounded
Allied soldiers. She and her fellow nurses also
graciously treated wounded German pris-
oners-of-war. When asked retrospectively
about the hospital’s treatment of German sol-
diers, she said, ‘‘They were people, and we
had to do it.’’ After two years of service, Irene
was honorably discharged.
Irene’s dedicated service has inspired Hoo-
siers and fellow Midwesterners throughout her
life, especially her own family. Her two sons,
Arthur and Paul Midle, followed her footsteps
into the armed forces, serving in the Marine
Corps and the Air Force respectively.
Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure
today to recognize Irene on her great mile-
stone. On behalf of Indiana’s 8th District, I
