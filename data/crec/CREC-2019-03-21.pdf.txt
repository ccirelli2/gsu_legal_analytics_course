Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the life of Sue Merrill Crawford
Antle, the matriarch of the central coast of
California’s Antle family. Sue will be remem-
bered as a devoted mother and wife, talented
sewing artist, and active supporter of her com-
munity.
Sue Antle was born on February 23, 1936
in Watsonville, California. A native of the Cen-
tral Coast, Sue attended Watsonville High
School, where she met Bob Antle. The two
would eventually enjoy 58 years of marriage
together.
Sue and Bob would remain on the Central
Coast throughout their lives, establishing even
deeper roots in their community. As Bob man-
aged his family’s lettuce company, Sue tended
to the family home and raised their four chil-
dren. Sue could often be found in her home’s
sewing room, where she created beautiful and
precious keepsakes for her family, friends, and
community. These pieces included Christmas
stockings for her entire family and colorful
jackets frequently auctioned for charity.
Sue and Bob’s family on the Central Coast
continued to grow to include her children’s
spouses, grandchildren, great grandchildren,
and nieces and nephews. Sue’s beloved fam-
ily was a foundation for her life and a blessing
that guided her desire to give back to her
community. Sue co-chaired California State
University Monterey Bay’s Have a Heart fund-
raiser for student scholarships and, as an avid
booklover, took joy in reading to children
through the Monterey County Reads program
established by the Panetta Institute for Public
Policy. Sue was a passionate advocate for the
children of field workers and leaves a legacy
of fostering early childhood education and
supporting first-generation college students.
Sue will be remembered for unfailing kind-
ness and generosity. We, as a community,
celebrate her legacy and life well-lived.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join
me in honoring the life of Sue Merrill Crawford
Antle.

HONORING MICHAEL MIKULKA
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the distinguished career of Mi-
chael Mikulka, who is retiring after 43 years of
distinguished service at the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA), and after
serving as President of AFGE Local 704. Mike
was recently awarded ‘‘Man of the Year’’ hon-
ors by AFGE District 7 for his fight to save the
EPA Region 5 office and the jobs of the sci-
entists and engineers who protect the Mid-
west. He helped protect our environment and
fought for the rights of EPA workers over his
more than four decades of work at the EPA,
and I honor and thank him for his important
work.
Michael Mikulka started his career at the
Environmental Protection Agency in November
1976 in the Water Division at EPA’s Region 5
Chicago, Illinois Office, where he first helped
municipalities receive grants under the Clean
Water Act (CWA) to install wastewater treat-
ment plant systems. He then enforced the
Clean Water Act, taking charge of the Re-
gion’s CWA enforcement, bringing cases in
civil court for injunctive relief and penalties
against polluters who dumped toxins into our
lakes and streams. Mike then moved to the
EPA Region 5 Land and Chemicals Division,
where he was charged with cleaning up com-
plicated hazardous waste sites in communities
throughout the Midwest.
As part of his career at EPA, Mike received
numerous commendations, awards and med-
als attesting to his superior service to the re-
gion. Mike has been a Professional Engineer
for over 35 years and was recently elected a
life member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers, where he has been a member for
over 40 years.
Some of the significant projects Mike
worked on at EPA include:
Participating on an inter-agency task force
which developed the plan to clean up the
Combined Sewer Overflows in the Twin Cities;
Helping develop the Region 5 Combined
Sewer Overflow (CSO) control strategy, much
of which was later incorporated into the na-
tional CSO control strategy;
Leading an interagency task force to de-
velop a strategy to clean up the Grand Cal-
umet River, the most polluted river in the
Great Lakes region;
Bringing and resolving cases against those
polluting the Grand Calumet River, as Chief of
Clean Water Act (CWA) enforcement officer
for Illinois, Indiana and Minnesota;
While he was the EPA Region 5 head of
CWA enforcement, the region consistently led
the nation in environmental enforcement with
respect to numbers of cases, penalties col-
lected, and environmental benefit;
Helping EPA Region 5’s Resource Con-
servation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Branch
became the regional enforcement contact on
the RCRA hazardous waste air emissions
standards and conducted training nationwide
for EPA, states and industry;
Providing technical assistance to regional
staff to develop and prosecute cases against
fuel blenders and other treatment, storage and
disposal facilities who were not meeting the
RCRA air emissions standards;
Working on significant hazardous waste
cleanup projects across the Region, including
active and closed steel mills in northwest Indi-
ana and Ohio;
Cleaning up arsenic and other contamina-
tion from the Menominee River, resulting in an
ability to de-list the river as a Great Lakes
Area of Concern.
As a Member of Congress, I have person-
ally worked with Mike and have observed his
endless dedication to the environment and to
the hard-working employees of the EPA. Mike
will be remembered for his important work pro-
tecting the environment in the region, for his
leadership in AFGE Local 704, and for his
support of the EPA and its wonderful staff. He
will be missed.

IN HONOR OF THE 2018–2019 AAAA
STATE CHAMPIONS: THE CARVER
TIGERS GIRLS BASKETBALL
TEAM
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the undefeated 2018–
2019 AAAA Girls Basketball Georgia State
Champions, the George Washington Carver
High School Tigers of Columbus, Georgia.
The team commemorated this significant mile-
stone on Sunday, March 17, 2019, with a
celebratory parade followed by a celebration
of honor at the Columbus Civic Center.
On Friday, March 8, 2019, the Tigers won
the state championship game against the
Spalding Jaguars by a score of 56–44. This
historic victory marked the first championship
and undefeated season for the Tigers after
coming up short in three Final Fours and two
state championships. The team placed No. 1
in the MaxPreps AAAA Girls Basketball
rankings for Region 1 and have won all but
two of their previous 31 games this season by
double digits.
Their victory in this year’s AAAA state
championship follows years of frustration, hard
work, and determination bursting forth into an
unbelievable season of teamwork and athletic
excellence. The perseverance of these Tigers,
after coming so close the past two seasons,
including a 68–67 overtime loss to in-town
rival Columbus High in the 2017 finals, was
shown this year in their exciting victory. More-
over, the team completed this spectacular
season with an astonishing overall win-loss
record of 33–0.
I cannot put into words the tremendous
pride that the citizens of Columbus, and in-
deed the entire Second Congressional District,
have in being able to call this outstanding
team of athletes their own. They have accom-
plished an incredible feat, one that could not
have been possible without the tireless leader-
ship and encouragement from their head
coach, Anson Hundley and his staff, as well
as their families, classmates, and members of
the community who believed in them and their
ability to bring home a state championship
title.

my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more

HONORING MR. RAFAEL B. CRUZ
ON HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY
HON. KENNY MARCHANT
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor and recognize my constituent,
Mr. Rafael B. Cruz for his 80th birthday on
March 22nd. A man of strong faith and un-
compromising willpower, Rafael embodies the
meaning of persistence, and serves as a lead-
ing example of what the American Dream can
look like with enough hard work and an un-
wavering belief in the prospect of liberty.
Born in Cuba under the oppressive Batista
regime, Rafael experienced assault and im-
prisonment as a teenager for taking an active
stance against the injustices he witnessed. In
search of a better life, he left his home at the
age of eighteen to pursue a degree in higher
education, and arrived in Austin, Texas where
he studied Mathematics and Chemical Engi-
neering. While in school, he worked seven
days a week for fifty cents an hour until he ob-
tained his degree in 1961. In addition to his
obligations as a student, Rafael maintained
strong ties with his community in Cuba and
advocated against the abuses of the newly
empowered Castro forces.
A family man by the early 1960s, Rafael
balanced his new career in the energy indus-
try with raising two daughters and his son,
current Texas Senator, TED CRUZ. Rafael
moved to Houston with his family to work and
found a lasting home in the state Texas.
Today, he resides in my district, in the City of
Carrollton, where he is a pastor, a supportive
father and grandfather, and an exemplary
member of our community.
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to recog-
nize the inspiring life story of Rafael Cruz, who
has fought for freedom, family and faith for all
of his life, and whose contributions to our
country will continue to make a mark on the
character of our American spirit. I ask all of
my distinguished colleagues to join me in
wishing a very happy 80th birthday to Mr.
Rafael Cruz.

CONGRATULATING MR. MATTHEW
ANTHONY OF CARBON COUNTY
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate and congratulate Mr. Matthew An-
thony of Palmerton, Pennsylvania. Matthew
proudly represented Carbon County at the
North American Special Olympics in Las
Vegas, Nevada, and was named the Special
Olympics North American Unified Gold Med-
alist in bowling.
Matthew competes with his father, Chris-
topher, and they are the first Special Olympics
unified team from Carbon County, as well as
the first bowling team from our area to make
it to the national competition.
Matthew has been actively involved with the
Special Olympics since the Carbon County
delegation was established fourteen years ago
and has competed in a variety of different
sports in addition to bowling, including floor
hockey, track and field and bocce. Matthew is
a strong competitor and a positive voice for all
members of the vibrant Special Olympics com-
munity and the constituents of Pennsylvania’s
Ninth Congressional District.
In his free time, Matthew works at his family
business in Palmerton, plays video games,
and enjoys restoring his 1987 Oldsmobile
Custom Cruiser Wood Panel Station Wagon.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in
the U.S. House of Representatives join me in
congratulating Matthew for his many achieve-
ments and outstanding legacy of continued
sportsmanship and wish him continued suc-
cess in all his future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
REUEL WALTERS
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize World War II veteran Reuel Walters
for his service to the United States of America.
Reuel was born at home in Livingston,
Texas on January 16, 1925. A midwife at-
tended to his mother. One of six children, at
the age of eighteen, Reuel was drafted and
courageously answered the call to serve and
defend his country in the United States Army.
Reuel completed his basic training in San An-
tonio, Texas and deployed as a radio control
repairman.
From 1941 to 1945, Reuel served in the
Solomon Islands, Bougainville Island, Sipan
Island and Guam. He saw the Enola Gay be-
fore it dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.
Reuel was in Guam when he heard the an-
nouncement over a loudspeaker that the war
had ended.
After his time in the service, Reuel worked
as a lineman for thirty-six years at Houston
Line & Power. In 1985, he retired and moved
to Livingston, Texas.
Madam Speaker, it is because of the sac-
rifices made by men and women like Reuel
Walters that we are able to enjoy the free-
doms that we hold so dear. Let us not forget
this great generation. We thank Reuel for the
contributions he has made to preserve our lib-
erty.

IN HONOR OF EDWARD STEVER’S
100TH BIRTHDAY
HON. RICHARD HUDSON
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Mr. Edward Stever and wish him a
very happy 100th birthday.
The attack on Pearl Harbor was an event
that not only shaped the course of our country
but the lives of many Americans, including Mr.
Stever. After Pearl Harbor was attacked he
was one of the many Americans who felt com-
pelled to fight against the Japanese. He then
joined the Army Air Corps where he served
until 1946. During his career he completed
countless dangerous, yet vital, missions deliv-
ering bombs and fuel from India to China. He
showed endless bravery and courage in his
pursuit to serve our country halfway across
the world.
After completing active duty, Mr. Stever re-
turned to his wife and two children and worked
for IBM in Binghamton, New York until he was
transferred to Charlotte, North Carolina. In
2007, he moved to Fayetteville and unfortu-
nately lost his wife after 69 years of marriage.
Despite his loss he still felt compelled to serve
our country and he has been volunteering at
the U.S. Army Airborne and Special Oper-
ations Museum, since 2011. In fact, he has
dedicated over 2,400 hours to the Museum. I
know I speak for everyone when I say we are
so thankful for him and all of his service to our
country and community.
The U.S. Army Airborne and Special Oper-
ations Museum had a goal of collecting 100
birthday cards for Mr. Stever’s birthday. I am
honored to play a small part in recognizing
him and all he has accomplished over the last
100 years.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
thanking Mr. Edward Stever for his service
and wishing him a Happy 100th birthday.

THANKING CHIEF BILL JOHN
BAKER
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to thank Chief Bill John
Baker for his many years of service to the
Cherokee people and to his community. Chief
Baker’s service to the Cherokee Nation and
the state of Oklahoma has touched the lives of
many, whether acting in the capacity of Prin-
cipal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, as a Cher-
okee Tribal Councilor, as PTA President, as
President of the Tahlequah Chamber of Com-
merce, or as the coach of local youth sports
teams.
Personally, my wife Tammy and I can attest
to Chief Bill John Baker’s dedication to com-
munity by our mutual involvement in the Ron-
ald McDonald House Charities. When we first
moved to Muskogee Oklahoma, Tammy called
Chief Baker to bring his attention to the Cher-
okee Nation women’s use of the Ronald
McDonald House—roughly 1/3rd of the
House’s inhabitants are Cherokee citizens.
Without hesitation, Chief Baker stepped up to
the plate and asked—how much money does
Ronald McDonald House need?
Chief Baker’s accomplishments have been
heralded by his colleagues and neighbors
alike. The town of Okay is grateful for the Vet-
erans Monument project that Chief Baker
spearheaded. People recall the countless
times that he expedited housing assistance for
disabled and elderly Cherokee citizens. Chief

the extra first response vehicles that he
helped secure for the Fire Department and the
drivers education cars that he worked to pro-
vide for the local schools.
All these amazing things that Chief Bill John
Baker had a hand in, ultimately help raise
awareness of the Cherokee people and their
presence in Northeastern Oklahoma. I con-
gratulate Chief Baker on his retirement, as it
is well deserved.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
HENRY P. ‘‘CORKY’’ ANDERSON III
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Henry P. ‘‘Corky’’ An-
derson III who passed away on February 23,
2019 at the age of 76. A lifelong Tulare Coun-
ty resident, Corky, as he was affectionately
known, was a renowned trailblazer in the pis-
tachio industry.
Corky’s passion for farming began at age 13
when he spent his days hauling hay for near-
by farms, and as the years went on he mas-
tered his craft while working up and down the
Pacific coast throughout California and Or-
egon. Corky was also a problem solver. The
California pistachio industry has historically
suffered due to a soil-borne fungus known as
verticillium wilt that kills thousands of trees
each year before they are mature enough for
commercial production. Along with his busi-
ness partner Ken Puryear, Corky developed a
pistachio rootstock resistant to verticillium wilt.
This development was nothing short of revolu-
tionary, and California’s current status as the
largest pistachio producer in the world can
largely be attributed to his hard work.
But Corky was involved in much more than
just pistachios. Ever the family man, he, along
with his brother Doug Anderson and sister
Debi Mitchell, founded AMA Pistachio Farming
and AMA Properties where they grew every-
thing from sugarbeets to cotton, invested in a
gold mine in Oregon, and diversified into office
building in Las Vegas and Arizona.
Corky is survived by his wife of 30 years,
Betty Jean Anderson, and an entire family that
loved him dearly. He will be remembered for
his kindness, love of life, and passion for farm-
ing. I was fortunate enough to have known
Corky for many years. He was an exceptional
farmer and an even better friend. On behalf of
California’s 23rd Congressional District, I ex-
tend my deepest condolences to the Anderson
family, and all of those whose lives Corky
touched.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA COURTS VACANCY
REDUCTION ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Courts Va-
cancy Reduction Act. This bill would allow
local District of Columbia court nominees to be
seated after a 30-day congressional review
period unless a resolution of disapproval is en-
acted into law during that period. Currently,
nominees cannot be seated without affirmative
Senate approval. The congressional review
process for nominees would be the same one
used for legislation passed by the D.C. Coun-
cil. It is therefore a reliable process, long-rec-
ognized by Congress. My bill is prompted by
the unique requirement that judges for the
local D.C. courts be confirmed by the Senate,
where nominees for the federal courts, under-
standably, get the primary focus and priority.
There is currently a vacancy crisis facing the
District’s criminal and civil courts, and the D.C.
courts have raised serious concerns due to
longstanding vacancies.
Whether Democrats or Republicans control
the Senate, the local D.C. courts regularly
face vacancy crises, which harm the oper-
ations of the judicial system in the District.
Congress created the D.C. Judicial Nomina-
tion Commission (JNC) to recommend can-
didates, and Congress should generally defer
to its judgment. This bill is a compromise, use-
ful to all concerned, that retains a congres-
sional role while saving the Senate time by re-
moving the need for committee and floor ac-
tion and increasing the odds that D.C. will
have a full complement of local judges.
Currently, there are seven vacancies out of
62 authorized judges on the D.C. Superior
Court and two vacancies out of nine author-
ized judges on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Both pre- and post-home rule, the District
has never had control over the nomination and
approval of local D.C. judges. My bill would
not alter the role of the JNC or the President
in the nomination process. Under the Home
Rule Act, the JNC recommends to the Presi-
dent a list of three persons for each vacancy
on the Superior Court and Court of Appeals.
The President must nominate a candidate rec-
ommended by the JNC within 60 days to the
Senate for advice and consent. If the Presi-
dent fails to nominate such a person within 60
days, the JNC must nominate a recommended
person directly to the Senate for advice and
consent. The Senate has no obligation to pro-
vide its advice and consent. Under this bill,
once a name has been transmitted to Con-
gress, the nomination would be deemed ap-
proved unless a resolution of disapproval is
enacted into law during a 30-legislative-day re-
view period.
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant legislation.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
RICHARD WADE
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
salute, honor and thank World War II veteran
Richard Wade.
On February 5, 1924 Richard Wade, Jr. was
born on an icy cold day to Richard and Mary
Frances Wade. When he was only five weeks
old, Richard’s grandparents, David Kearney,
an Irish immigrant, and his wife, Illa, began to
raise him. Richard spent his childhood and
teen years in Portland, Maine.
In January of 1942, Richard enlisted in the
United States Navy. He trained in aviation
radio at Naval Air Station Banana River, now
called Patrick Air Force Base. He worked con-
voy coverage and submarine patrol and was a
part of the Helicopter Development Squadron.
While in service, he traveled to Brazil where
he was stationed for three and a half months.
Other assignments in Brazil took him to Aratu
and Natal. In Natal, Richard worked the radio
one night for so long that he became deaf and
did not regain his hearing for two days. Rich-
ard received the American Theater Ribbon,
World War II Victory Medal and Combat Air
crewman Insignia.
While stationed in Corpus Christi, Texas,
Richard received the news that the war had
ended. He remembers the historic occasion
and celebrating with his buddies. Richard
worked for thirty years at Missouri Pacific Rail-
road as a truck driver. He retired and settled
in Rye, Texas, and currently resides in Living-
ston, Texas.
We thank Richard Wade for responding to
the call to protect and defend this great nation.
His sacrifices exemplify why our nation re-
mains ‘‘the land of the free and the home of
the brave.’’

REMEMBERING THE LATE U.S.
ARMY CAPTAIN ANTOINE LEWIS
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I
rise to remember the late U.S. Army Captain
Antoine Lewis of Matteson, IL in the Second
Congressional District.
I was shocked and saddened to learn that
Captain Lewis was among the 157 people
killed in the tragic plane crash in Ethiopia on
March 10th.
This incredible young man had so much
more to give the world and constantly gave of
himself to others. He possessed an irrepress-
ible curiosity and a desire to make the world
a better place.
Captain Lewis was a man of passionate
commitment to his family, to the Matteson
community, to our country, and to his faith.
An honorable man, he represented the very
best of America whenever he served in uni-
form or wherever he traveled in the world.
Captain Lewis was a patriot who proudly
served his country. He had been stationed in
Afghanistan, South Korea and Canada. He
had an adventuresome and free spirit and was
filled with wonder and curiosity about other
people and cultures.
While he was raised in Matteson, he be-
longed to the world.
He, like many others, went to Africa to offer
hope and opportunity to others through mis-
sion work. As called to do by St. James, he
put his faith into actions and deeds that up-
lifted others and worked to build a better
world.
The entire Second District mourn this tre-
mendous loss to our community.
As we grieve with his family and friends, we
are comforted by the knowledge that he did
fulfill his desire to make the world a better
place—by the love he gave to every person
and mission that he encountered.

BURLINGTON COUNTY’S TEACH-
ER OF THE YEAR BY THE NEW
JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF EDU-
CATION
HON. ANDY KIM
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Ms. Melissa Antinoff, a devoted ed-
ucator who has helped shape the minds of
New Jersey’s youth throughout her 19 years
as a public school teacher. Ms. Antinoff was
recently named Burlington County’s Teacher
of the Year by the New Jersey Department of
Education for her tireless work as a 3rd grade
teacher at Ashbrook Elementary School.
Passionate from an early age about working
with and educating children, Ms. Antinoff has
developed a classroom environment that fos-
ters innovation, creativity, and self-confidence
within her students. Ms. Antinoff recognizes
the importance of reading to developing a
child’s sense of confidence and therefore
strongly encourages independent reading in
her classroom. She credits this practice with
instilling in her students greater self-esteem
and willingness to take risks in their other
areas of study. Ms. Antinoff’s colleagues
praise her for her ingenious ability to integrate
interdisciplinary elements, such as music, into
her classroom as well as her eagerness to
take risks in her instruction methods including
granting her students the independence to
work’ and learn collaboratively in small groups.
Ms. Antinoff is a prime example of the kind
of teacher who goes above and beyond to en-
sure that the well-being of the entire student,
including his or her emotional and mental
needs are attended to just as much as his or
her academic needs. Above all else, she
wants her students to have the confidence to
enjoy school and feel safe and secure there
so that they can learn and grow creatively. For
these reasons, I am proud to honor Ms.
Antinoff for her efforts and sincerely thank her
for the positive influence she has had on
countless students throughout her distin-
guished career.

RECOGNIZING BEN FERENCZ
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Mr. Ben Ferencz. Ben is the last
living Nuremberg prosecutor and is also cele-
brating his 100th Birthday.
Born in Transylvania in 1920, Ben immi-
grated to the United States and attended pub-
lic schools in New York. He won a scholarship
to Harvard Law School where he worked as a
research assistant for a professor writing a
book on war crimes. He received his degree
in 1943 and promptly joined the U.S. Army as
a private in the artillery. He was awarded five
battle stars for not being killed or wounded at
Normandy Beach and every major campaign
in Europe.
As the war was ending, he was transferred
to General Patton’s HQ to serve as a war
crimes investigator. He entered many Nazi
concentration camps as they were liberated
and the horrors he saw made an indelible im-
pression. When he returned home, he was re-
cruited by General Telford Taylor to return to
Germany to help in the additional war crimes
trials.
He was appointed Chief Prosecutor in what
was aptly described as the biggest murder trial
in history—the ‘‘Einsatzgreuppen case.’’ All 22
defendants, including six SS Generals, were
convicted of murdering over a million innocent
men, women, and children. Ben was 27 years
old and it was his first case.
Since then, Ben has dedicated much of his
life to seeking compensation for victims and
trying to prevent illegal war-making. He be-
came a self-appointed personal lobbyist for
peace, with countless lectures, publications,
and speeches at many universities and in
countries around the world.
Madam Speaker, today I am pleased to
honor Mr. Ben Ferencz and his service to his
country, his community, and the world. Happy
Birthday to Ben.

Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Dr. Robert Dann, a beloved fam-
ily man, a pillar of his community, and a
lauded veterinarian, in celebration of his re-
cent retirement. A 1979 graduate of the Uni-
versity of Illinois College of Veterinary Medi-
cine, Dr. Dann shortly thereafter became an
owner and director of Blum Animal Hospital, a
mainstay of Chicago’s Lakeview neighbor-
hood. Over the course of four decades, Dr.
Dann has served countless animals and their
owners from across the city, seeing firsthand
time and again the power for good that pets
can be. After transitioning from several roles
within the Hospital to spend more time with his
family, Dr. Dann has remained practicing until
today.
Ever since I was a kid visiting the Lincoln
Park Zoo for the first time, a love for animals
has been a through-line of my entire life.
Since coming to Congress, I’ve had the privi-
lege of defending endangered species and
working on key animal protection issues; how-
ever; I’ve never forgotten just how much joy
my family’s own furry friend, our dog Scout,
has brought us over the years.
Without caring and committed veterinarians
like Dr. Dann, millions of pet owners across
the country just like myself would not have the
same happy memories that I do. Dr. Dann’s
work has been repeatedly recognized, includ-
ing when he was named one of Chicago’s top
veterinarians. Beyond his contributions to the
city’s canine and feline populations, Dr. Dann
has remained engaged in his community, sit-
ting on the boards of two charitable founda-
tions. Through his decades-long commitment
to the veterinary medicine profession, and his
work to support others in his community, Dr.
Dann truly embodies the best of our neighbor-
hoods and our city.
I thoroughly congratulate Dr. Dann on his
forty-year career, on behalf of myself and the
thousands of animals he has cared for along
the way.

HONORING MS. DELINA
RODRIGUES OF CARBON COUNTY
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and honor Ms. Delina Rodrigues
of Carbon County, who represented the United
States at the Special Olympics World Games
in the United Arab Emirates. Delina took home
three medals from the games: a bronze medal
in the bench press competition and two gold
medals in the deadlift and overall lifting
events.
Delina’s success at the Special Olympics is
the result of her many years of hard work and
dedication to power lifting and track and field
events. Having competed in various sports for
Carbon County’s Special Olympics Organiza-
tion for fourteen years, she continues to ex-
hibit great mental strength, athletic skill, and
sportsmanship as she competes on the global
stage.
In addition to her outstanding athletic ac-
complishments, Delina is also a graduate of
Carbon County Technical Institute. She is a
great representation of the values we hold
dear in Pennsylvania’s Ninth District: courage,
enthusiasm, and perseverance.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
in the U.S. House of Representatives join me
in celebrating Delina’s remarkable achieve-
ments and wishing her continued success in
all her future endeavors and competitions.

CELEBRATING THE INVESTITURE
OF DR. LILY D. MCNAIR, 8TH
PRESIDENT OF TUSKEGEE UNI-
VERSITY
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the Inaugural Con-
vocation and Investiture of Dr. Lily D. McNair
as the 8th President of Tuskegee University
and the first woman to ever serve as Presi-
dent in the University’s storied 136-year his-
tory. Prior to her appointment at Tuskegee, Dr.
McNair served for nearly seven years as pro-
vost and senior vice academic for affairs at
Wagner College—a private college of 2,200
students located in Staten Island, New York.
Dr. McNair grew up in Browns Mills, New
Jersey and is the eldest of four children. She
is the daughter of a Japanese seamstress and
an African American veteran who worked as a
payroll clerk after serving in the Korean War.
Unlike many of her friends at other schools,
Dr. McNair was lucky to have a high school
guidance counselor who encouraged her, an
aspiring first-generation college student with
scarce financial resources, to apply to the Ivy
League university she had dreamed of attend-
ing since she was a little girl. Because of her
own experience, Dr. McNair believes in the
value of mentorship and has placed a special
emphasis on working with students and faculty
to advance their goals.
Dr. McNair was the first in her family to at-
tend college, and among the first African
American women to attend Princeton Univer-
sity just six years after the university began
admitting women. Dr. McNair earned her
bachelor’s degree in psychology in 1979, and
master and doctorate degrees in psychology
from the State University of New York at
Stony Brook.
Dr. McNair served as associate professor of
psychology and associate director of the Clin-
ical Psychology Doctoral Training Program at
The University of Georgia, where in 1999 she
was the first African American woman to ob-
tain tenure and promotion in the psychology
department. Dr. McNair’s career in higher edu-
cation also includes other appointments at the
State University of New York at New Paltz,
Vassar College and Spelman College. At
Spelman, Dr. McNair was responsible for culti-
vating the institution’s research capabilities,
worked to strengthen faculty involvement in re-
search and improve the efficiency of research
resources.
Dr. McNair’s upbringing in a working-class
family and her public school background deep-
ly influenced her philosophy on higher edu-
cation, as she has sought to elevate and open
doors of opportunity for minorities in aca-
demia. While at the University of Georgia, she
was actively involved in increasing the num-
bers of African American psychology graduate
students. Likewise, as the Provost and Vice
President for Academic Affairs at Wagner Col-
lege, Dr. McNair helped increase the diversity
of hired faculty by over 115 percent.
A clinical psychologist by training, Dr.
McNair’s research has focused on the devel-
opment and evaluation of community-based
interventions that target substance abuse and
early sexual behavior in African American
youth. Preliminary findings of her longitudinal
studies demonstrate the significant impact of
positive parenting practices on children’s out-
comes across a variety of domains.
In addition to her numerous academic ac-
complishments, Dr. McNair is a dedicated
mother to Randall and Marguerite Roberts,
and wife of Dr. George W. Roberts, a retired
senior administrator at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
On a personal note, I am proud to know Dr.
McNair as a fellow graduate of Princeton Uni-
versity. She is a devoted administrator, com-
mitted public servant, inspirational figure, tire-
less educator, loving wife and proud mother. I
know Dr. McNair will be an exemplary presi-
dent of this esteemed institution, bringing to
the position a keen intellect, strong advocacy
abilities, steadfast work ethic and deep faith in
God and the power of Mother Tuskegee. I
look forward to continuing to work with Dr.
McNair in her new position to bring more re-
sources and greater opportunities to Tuskegee
University. I gladly wish her well in her new
endeavors.
On behalf of the 7th Congressional District
and the State of Alabama, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the inaugura-
tion of Dr. Lily D. McNair as the 8th President
of Tuskegee University and as the first woman
to ever hold the position. I am honored to pay
tribute to Dr. McNair for her tireless service
and for the stellar and positive leadership she
will surely continue to provide for all those
who are a part of the Tuskegee University
family.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE NA-
TIONAL COMMUNITY DEVELOP-
MENT ASSOCIATION’S 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary
of the National Community Development As-
sociation (NCDA). Since its genesis in 1969,
the NCDA has been a pillar of support for cit-
ies and counties across the country, including
the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri.
The NCDA is a nonpartisan, national, non-
profit organization that was established to as-
sist cities across the nation in administering
the new U.S. Housing and Urban Develop-
ment funds and programs created through
President Johnson’s Model Cities Program. In
doing so, they rose to help address the great
disparities in housing options and opportuni-
ties that had created racial and socioeconomic
inequality in many of our great American cit-
ies.
The NCDA represents cities on a federal
level for programs such as the Community De-
velopment Block Grant Program (CDBG) and
HOME Investment Partnerships, among a
myriad of others. Specifically, the NCDA has
fought to improve local infrastructure and pro-
vide greater accessibility to safe, decent, and
affordable housing, as well as greater eco-
nomic opportunities. Through these initiatives,
the organization has expressed a commitment
to providing tangible services that will
strengthen both families and communities
across the country. Through the NCDA’s pres-
tigious John Sasso Award and Audrey Nelson
Award for Best Practices in Community Devel-
opment, they annually recognize and celebrate
significant contributions and solutions to af-
fordable and alternative housing projects
through federal grants.
Moreover, as an integral part of the NCDA
model, they respect diversity and inclusion in
leadership as a fundamental part of effective
leadership. Throughout their fifty years of serv-
ice, the organization sought to represent diver-
sified backgrounds and individualized exper-
tise. They continue to include a wide variety of
organizations and individual voices as we col-
lectively search for solutions to urban difficul-
ties and discover ways to implement greater
equity in housing as time moves forward.
These voices are brought to national attention
each year at the National Community Devel-
opment Week hosted by the NCDA. This an-
nual conference educates Members of Con-
gress on the achievements of federal pro-
grams like HOME and CDBG so that these
programs can continue to address a need for
affordable housing and community develop-
ment.
Today, NCDA membership has grown to in-
clude over 400 separate cities and counties.
The organizations and governments rep-
resented across that vast membership con-
tinue to carry out a centralized goal and pur-
pose. As they have been since day one, the
NCDA continues to serve as a united, national
institution to provide services and support for
local governments and policy makers as they
work on critical federal community develop-
ment and housing programs.
Madam Speaker, please join with Missouri’s
Fifth Congressional District in honoring the
National Community Development Association
for their remarkable achievements over the
span of fifty years across the nation and in our
own community. We stand to celebrate their
indelible mark on our society.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SARDUL
SINGH SIHOTA
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
along with my colleague, Mr. COX, to honor
the life of Sardul Singh Sihota, who passed
away on March 5, 2019 at the age of 77.
Throughout his life, Sardul was known for his
contribution to the agriculture industry, his in-
volvement with the Central Valley Sikh Amer-
ican community, and his role in establishing
the first Sikh Temple in Selma, California.
Sardul was born on May 15, 1941 in Bara
Pind, District Jalandhar, India to Assa Singh
and Amar Kaur Singh. Sardul immigrated to
Yuba City, California in 1961 to start a new
chapter in his life and create a prosperous
foundation for his family. Having been raised
on a farm in India, Sardul moved to Selma,
California, where he began to grow raisin
grapes and continue his family’s tradition of
farming. Two years later, Sardul bought his
first piece of property in Selma, which his fam-
ily continues to live on today.
As one of the first Sikh Indians to live in
Selma in the mid-1960s, Sardul had a desire
to help other families immigrate to the Central
Valley for a better life. He assisted many fami-
lies by sharing his knowledge about the immi-
gration process and acclimating to the life in
the U.S. As a result, Selma became the new
home to thousands of Sikh American families.
As the Sikh community continued to grow
and flourish, Sardul noticed the lack of tem-
ples close by where families could worship,
celebrate, and mourn. He worked with his
friends to build Selma’s first Sikh Temple in
1987.
Sardul is survived by his parents, his wife
Jitendra, two daughters, Gurdeep Hebert and
Harroop, and three sons, Paul, Simon, and
Navjot, along with a host of extended family
and friends.
Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure
that we ask our colleagues to join us in hon-
oring the life of Sardul Singh Sihota and the
great legacy that he leaves behind. Sardul will
be remembered by his community for his gen-
erosity, hard work, and commitment to his
friends and family. With all the relationships
that he has forged along his journey, his mem-
ory will be forever remembered.

IN HONOR OF THE 2018–2019 STATE
CLASS A PUBLIC-SCHOOL CHAM-
PIONS: THE MARION COUNTY
LADY EAGLES BASKETBALL
TEAM
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the 2018–2019 Geor-
gia State Class A Public-School Basketball
Champions, the Marion County Lady Eagles of
Buena Vista, Georgia. The team commemo-
rated this significant milestone on Thursday,
March 21, 2019, with a celebration of honor at
Marion County High School in Buena Vista,
Georgia.
On Wednesday, March 6, 2019, fans at the
Macon Coliseum observed as the Lady Eagles
won the state championship game against the
Calhoun County Cougars by a score of 50–38.
The Lady Eagles outrebounded their oppo-
nents (with a rebound total of 40–to–27) and
made 21 of 30 free throws. This victory
marked the end of an incredible year of hard
work. The team has been ranked No. 1 for the
entirety of the 2018–2019 season with an un-
believable 29–1 win-loss record. This cham-
pionship game also marks a remarkable
comeback for the Lady Eagles, who lost last
year’s game to the Greenville girls’ basketball
team by a score of 73–52.
The Lady Eagles’ victory in this year’s final
exemplifies years of tireless determination
which culminated into an inspiring season of
teamwork and athletic excellence, counting a
total of 1,910 points across 30 games. I am
thrilled to honor this team as they celebrate
the first girls’ basketball state championship in
the school’s history. The senior class has
been among the most successful ever, grad-
uating with a winning record of 92–24.
I cannot put into words the tremendous
pride that the citizens of Buena Vista, and in-
deed in the entire Second Congressional Dis-
trict, have in being able to call this outstanding
team of athletes their own. They have accom-
plished an amazing feat, one that could not
have been possible without the direction and
inspiration of their coach, Fran McPherson,
and her staff, as well as their families, class-
mates, and members of the community who
believed in them and their ability to bring
home a state championship title.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more
than 730,000 people of Georgia’s Second
Congressional District in congratulating and
honoring these hardworking young women
who have persevered, sacrificed, and
achieved the pinnacle of success in basket-
ball—the Georgia Class A State Champion-
ship title.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
MERDOLPH WALKER
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of World War II veteran, teacher,
professional football player and rancher, Mr.
Merdolph Walker.
Merdolph was born on a cold winter’s night
on January 16, 1923, in Soda, Texas. He was
born in a small wooden house as sleet and
snow fell outside. The midwife attending to his
mother had to walk a mile home that night
holding kindling for a light. The oldest of seven
children, Merdolph attended Soda Grammar
School, walking two miles to and from school
each day.
While attending college at Sam Houston
State University, Merdolph was drafted into
the Army, serving from 1942 to 1946 as a
combat engineer. Stationed in Guam during
World War II, he received orders in his first
week to search for land mines. Merdolph
spent his next six weeks on open waters un-
loading cargo boats. There were no beds on-
board, so he slept wherever he could find an
empty space. In one combat mission, gunfire
was exchanged. Later, for seven months,
Merdolph and other combat engineers would
spend twelve hours a day building the runway
used by the aircraft which dropped the atomic
bomb and ended World War II. By that time,
Merdolph was in Okinawa, Japan, where upon
hearing shots fired and shouting, he and a
buddy ran outside to learn the war had finally
ended.
After returning to the states, Merdolph re-
enrolled at Sam Houston College. He received
his master’s degree in administration, majored
in physical education and minored in industrial
arts. In 1948, he began a short career playing
professional football in Pittsburg before decid-
ing he could make more money teaching and
coaching. Merdolph taught and coached for
thirty-four years before retiring.
Madam Speaker, let us pause to honor this
patriot who has faithfully, and humbly served
our country, state and community.

Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today

a lengthy and illustrious career with the City of
Chicago and with Plumbers Local 130 UA.
Mr. Tierney was born in 1955 to his parents,
John (Jack), a former Union and City of Chi-
cago Hoisting Engineer/Crane Operator, and
Beverly Tierney. Mr. Tierney also has four sib-
lings, Jack (Cheri), Marilyn (Bill) Haugh, Patti
(Chuck) Addesso, and Brian.
Mr. Tierney began his career in 1975 as a
laborer in the City of Chicago’s Water Depart-
ment; in 1986, he was promoted to Foreman,
and just four years later, Mr. Tierney was
again promoted, this time to District Foreman
for the Department.
In 1995, Mr. Tierney became the Assistant
Superintendent of Water Distribution, where
he assisted the Superintendent in overseeing
construction for the entire district. In this role,
he had the opportunity to serve for six months
as interim Superintendent for the Department.
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Tierney officially took
over as the District Superintendent of Water
Distribution and Sewers for the City of Chi-
cago.
In 2012 with more than thirty-five years of
experience in his field, Mr. Tierney became
the Director of Political and Municipal Affairs
for Plumbers Local 130 UA, the same organi-
zation from which he earned his education in
plumbing twenty-eight years prior. In this posi-
tion, Mr. Tierney represented all Local 130
employees at the City, County and State lev-
els. He also negotiated all Local 130 contracts
for the City of Chicago and Cook County.
Mr. Tierney would be the first to tell you that
his family is his first priority; they are the loves
of his life. He has been married to his wife,
Kathy McManus, since 2003. Mr. Tierney has
two children; his daughter, Colleen Scarola,

HAPPY SESQUICENTENNIAL—CELE-
BRATING 150 YEARS OF THE
WEST POINT ASSOCIATION OF
GRADUATES
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
clude in the RECORD an article by Keith J.
Hamel honoring the 150th Anniversary of the
West Point Association of Graduates.
‘‘On May 22, 2019, the West Point Associa-
tion of Graduates will turn 150 years old.
Think about it—one hundred and fifty years!
When ‘‘the Association,’’ as it used to be
known, held its first organizational meeting
in the office of Dr. Horace Webster, Class of
1818, President of the College of the City of
New York, the light bulb had yet to be in-
vented; the telephone had not been patented;
the U.S. flag had only 37 stars; and the ma-
chine gun, dynamite, and the torpedo were
less than a decade old.
The year was 1869, an important year in
the history of West Point graduates. On
March 4 of that year, Ulysses S. Grant, Class
of 1843, became the 18th President of the
United States. Grant, of course, received na-
tional acclaim for commanding the Union
Army to victory during the U.S. Civil War,
accepting the surrender of Confederate
forces from another West Point graduate,
Robert E. Lee, Class of 1829. That recent con-
flict, roughly four years over by the time a
handful of graduates met in Webster’s office
one Saturday afternoon for that first meet-
ing, is often cited as the reason the ‘‘Asso-
ciation’’ was formed; that is, to heal the di-
vide between West Point graduates who
fought on opposing sides of the U.S. Civil
War. While it may be romanticized, such a
theory is plausible. After all, bridging
chasms seemed to be the spirit of the age in
1869. On May 2 of that year the ‘‘golden
spike’’ of the First Transcontinental Rail-
road was driven into the ground at Prom-
ontory Summit of Utah Territory, linking
America’s East Coast with its West Coast.
Later that year, on November 17, the Suez
Canal officially opened, finally completing a
centuries-old idea to create a waterway be-
tween the Mediterranean and the Indian
Ocean.
Yet when Robert Anderson, Class of 1825,
wrote to Sylvanus Thayer, Class of 1808, on
January 28, 1869 to propose the formation of
‘‘an association of the graduates of the Mili-
tary Academy,’’ he never mentioned the
Civil War as a raison d’être for this endeavor
(and Anderson was the officer in charge of
Fort Sumter when it was fired upon by P. G.
T. Beauregard, Class of 1838, to start that
war!) Instead, Anderson plainly told Thayer
he wanted to form an association ‘‘to see
what should be done to perfect and perpet-
uate this truly national Institution,’’ [West
Point] and, in his February 12, 1869 reply to
Anderson, Thayer agreed.
Three months later, 15 graduates gathered
in Webster’s office for the purposes of offi-
cially forming an ‘‘Association of the Grad-
uates of the U.S. Military Academy.’’ Nei-
ther the Civil War nor the ‘‘perpetuation’’ of
West Point was explicitly mentioned in the
minutes from that meeting. Instead, the
graduates present, including Anderson,
passed seven resolutions, the last pertaining
to the ‘‘fundamental principle that the char-
acteristic of this Association shall be.’’ Ac-
cording to the ‘‘Preliminary Meeting’’ min-
utes, Reverend Dr. Francis Vinton, Class of
1830, Assistant Minister of Trinity Church in
New York City, introduced a resolution that
the Association be ‘‘formed purely for the
promotion of social and fraternal inter-
course.’’ Vinton’s resolution became Article
II of the new Association’s Constitution:
‘‘The objects of this Association shall be to
cherish the memories of our Alma Mater,
and to promote the social intercourse and
fraternal fellowship of its graduates.’’
Does this end the debate regarding the pur-
pose of the Association of Graduates’ found-
ing? Not quite. Article IV of the Associa-
tion’s original Constitution complicates
matters. It states, ‘‘Political, or any other
discussions foreign to the purposes of the As-
sociation, as set forth in this Constitution,
or any proceedings of such a tendency, are
declared inimical to the purposes of this or-
ganization, and are prohibited.’’ Such an ar-
ticle calls attention to itself and seems to
support the notion that the recent U.S. Civil
War and its political aftermath might im-
pede the formation of an Association of West
Point Graduates. Furthermore, Article III,
paragraph 2, states, ‘‘The oldest graduate be-
longing to the Association shall be Presi-
dent; and in his absence the senior graduate
present shall preside at the meeting of the
Association.’’ This made Thayer the Associa-
tion’s ‘‘official’’ first president. Although
Thayer never attended a meeting of the As-
sociation of Graduates (and, interestingly,
his name does not appear on the roll of mem-
bers until 1872), this passage marries
Thayer’s legacy with the creation of the As-
sociation, including his desire to form such
an organization for the benefit of West
Point. Going forward, both implicit political
matters and the promotion of West Point
routinely enter into the dialogue regarding
the Association’s early history and business.
Take the Association’s first public act
after a committee of 13 graduates, chaired by
Webster, met on June 16, 1869 and drafted the
constitution and bylaws for the new Associa-
tion. Soon after, the committee mailed the
proposed constitution and bylaws to all grad-
uates; 128 joined (of more than 1,350 living
graduates), including three former Confed-
erate officers: Richard S. Ewell, Class of 1840;
James Longstreet, Class of 1842; and Nathan-
iel R. Chambliss, Class of May 1861. In fact,
Ewell sent a letter back with his dues stat-
ing, ‘‘I cannot think that any graduate of the
Academy would, unless blinded by preju-
dices, decline to aid the work of reuniting
. . . a bond broken asunder by civil discord
and war.’’ Conversely, Simon Bolivar
Buckner, Class of 1844, the first Confederate
general to surrender an Army to Union
forces, perhaps stinging from so-called ‘‘Rad-
ical Republicans’’ attempts to strip ex-rebels
of their right to vote and hold office in the
First Reconstruction Act (1867), wrote back
to the committee saying, ‘‘Fraternal fellow-
ship can exist only in the light of an ac-
knowledged equality, [which] is denounced
by the legislation of the central government
which extends its fostering care to our class
of graduates of our Alma Mater and at the
same time prescribes the other . . . an ac-
knowledgement of the inequality which ren-
ders agreeable social intercourse impos-
sible.’’ Buckner’s sentiment becomes an im-
portant theme taken up by committee mem-
ber Charles Davies, Class of 1815, in his ad-
dress to graduates at the Association’s first
reunion on June 17, 1870.
Forty-three graduates sat in the pews of
the West Point Chapel (now known as the
Old Cadet Chapel) to hear Davies’ address.
Although no Southern graduates attended
that first open meeting (more likely due to
the prohibitive cost of travel than to ideo-
logical allegiances), Davies used poetic lan-
guage in his speech to delicately and dip-
lomatically address the issue raised by
Buckner, that is the seeming rift between
graduates who fought on opposite sides of
the U.S. Civil War. ‘‘We come together as the
scattered members of a household after a
long separation—some full of years, some
full of honors,’’ said Davies, recalling the
metaphor of a ‘‘divided house’’ used by Presi-
dent Abraham Lincoln in a famous 1858
speech. Why would Davies use such lan-
guage? The answer is reunification. But,
digging deeper, it is not just a reunification
of graduates from the North and the South;
it is a reunification between West Point
graduates and the United States of America.
Just one sentence prior, Davies said, ‘‘We
come together under the old flag, dear to
every American heart, to recall and con-
template that springtime of life . . . .’’ In
this and his future reunion addresses, Davies
continually uses a ‘‘reunification with the
country’’ theme to tacitly unite graduates
from the North and from the South behind a
single purpose.
‘‘We meet to revive cherished memories
. . . and to renew, together, vows of per-
petual allegiance to our country,’’ Davies
said in the opening to his 1870 address. As
noted by George Pappas in his book To the
Point: The United States Military Academy
1802–1902, ‘‘The defection of southern cadets
and graduates, termed treason by many an-
tagonists, was used as a stepping-stone for
criticizing West Point in general and its
graduates in particular.’’ The Civil War
thrust West Point and its graduates, particu-
larly those who defected to fight for the Con-
federate cause, into the national spotlight,
and, as noted by Harry Williams in his arti-
cle ‘‘The Attack Upon West Point During the
Civil War,’’ ‘‘. . . the [Academy] faced and
weathered a series of dangerous attacks de-
signed to destroy its existence.’’
Those who gathered in those early re-
unions must have been aware that West
Point stood on precarious footing in the
years immediately following the Civil War,
as well as the distrust felt for Southern grad-
uates. In his address at the Second Annual
Reunion on June 17, 1871, Davies’ concluding
words seem to be as much for the graduates
as for a public he felt may still be wary of
the future political intentions of West Point
alumni ‘‘But above all, fellow graduates,’’
Davies said, ‘‘let us remember that the na-
tion which sustains and has spread its man-
tle over this institution, expects from every
graduate, at all times, and wheresoever he
may be, the full measure of his duty.’’ Then
in his last (and longest) address to grad-
uates, commemorating the centennial of the
Battle of Bunker Hill (1875), Davies made his
most overt gesture to reunification between
graduates from the North and South via re-
newed allegiance to the nation. He began by
reminding graduates of the resolution passed
at the annual meeting a year earlier to in-
vite graduates from ‘‘all sections of the
country’’ to the 1875 reunion. Seven of the
Association’s 12 former Confederate officer
members attended this reunion, the most
ever up to that point. ‘‘[W]e have come here
today, to bury within the circuit of these
mountains all recollections which can sepa-
rate us from each other, or from our common
country,’’ Davies said, ‘‘. . . and to say to
all, for each, and to each for all, that from
this auspicious day, all the graduates of this
Institution will recognize each other as
friends. Henceforth, and forever, we have one
flag—one country—one destiny.’’
Interestingly, before championing the pa-
triotism of West Point graduates, Davies

lauded the accomplishments of West Point
itself through its graduates. ‘‘We behold,
also, a great Institution,’’ he said in his 1875
address, ‘‘. . . scattering science and knowl-
edge over the nation,’’ which seems to pay
homage to Thayer and Anderson’s original
aim for the Association, ‘‘to see what should
be done to perfect and perpetuate this truly
national Institution.’’ Davies died in 1876,
and, according to David Pinder ’86, in his
paper ‘‘The Association of Graduates of the
U.S. Military Academy, 1869–1902: The Heal-
ing Years,’’ the leadership of the AOG passed
to George Cullum, Class of 1833. One of the
original 15 members of the Association,
Cullum became a member of AOG’s Execu-
tive Committee in 1871 and chaired this com-
mittee until his death in 1892. A year before
those 15 grads met in Webster’s office to
form the Association, Cullum published the
first edition of his three-volume Biographi-
cal Register of the Officers of the United
States Military Academy, which he de-
scribed in its preface as a record of West
Point graduates’ service to the nation so as
to give ‘‘world-renown to their Alma Mater.’’
In the preface to his third edition of the Reg-
ister, published in 1891, Cullum’s intent be-
came more explicit. There he wrote that he
hoped ‘‘this last legacy to Alma Mater and
her numerous sons may further prove the
usefulness of that noble national institu-
tion,’’ nearly echoing Thayer and Anderson’s
original aim for the Association. While re-
unification seemed to be Davies’ primary
ambition, championing the accomplishments
of graduates for the glory of West Point was
clearly the achievement for which Cullum
was known. In fact, at that first meeting in
1870, the first order of business after approv-
ing the constitution and by-laws was adopt-
ing a resolution that gave thanks to Cullum
‘‘for his truthful and admirable annals of the
Military Academy and its Graduates.’’
Cullum demonstrated his philosophy for
West Point and its graduates in the biog-
raphies he wrote for ‘‘Necrology,’’ that sec-
tion of the Association’s published annual
report identifying the graduates who had
died since the last meeting. In the 1871 An-
nual Reunion, the first to acknowledge the
author of each graduate’s biography, Cullum
is cited as having written five of them, the
first being for Ethan Allen Hitchcock, Class
of 1817. And while other authors devoted
paragraphs to the deceased, Cullum wrote
pages (Hitchcock’s biography is 10 pages
long). Cullum continued writing ‘‘Necrol-
ogy’’ biographies right up until his own
death, the last one for Montgomery C. Meigs,
Class of 1836, who died January 2, 1892.
Cullum himself died February 28 of that
year, and his own ‘‘Necrology’’ biography ap-
pears just six pages after Meigs’.
Cullum had started writing an extended bi-
ography of Thayer for the 1873 Annual Re-
union, but, according to a Secretary note in
that record, Cullum’s absence in Europe pre-
vented the completion of it in time for publi-
cation. Ten years later, Cullum likely incor-
porated portions of that biography into the
momentous address he delivered at the un-
veiling of the Thayer Statue on June 11, 1883,
touting Thayer’s impact on West Point and
the nation. Consider this passage: ‘‘With
each evolving year of Colonel Thayer’s
Superintendency, class after class was grad-
uated, adding to our army 570 officers, of
whom the nation may be justly proud, for in
that galaxy are many bright particular stars
which have given lustre to our arms, illumi-
nated the paths of science, brightened halls
of learning, and adorned various vocations of
usefulness.’’ Cullum was perpetuating the
national institution of West Point by dem-
onstrating the perfections of its honorific fa-
ther. But this is not all that Cullum did as
the Association’s de facto leader.
Cullum had been Chairman of the Thayer
Monument Committee, which was estab-
lished at the June 12, 1873 annual meeting,
and was instrumental in bringing Thayer’s
remains from his hometown of South Brain-
tree, Massachusetts to West Point. This ac-
complishment could be viewed as the Asso-
ciation’s first official act of external busi-
ness (a year earlier the Executive Committee
resolved to have the body of Joseph Swift,
Class of 1802, exhumed and re-interred at the
West Point Cemetery, but this ambition
never materialized). Thayer’s remains were
re-interred at West Point on November 8,
1877, but the monument intended to honor
his memory remained unfinished, as only
$1,225 of an anticipated $3,100 had been raised
from graduates. At the 10th Annual Reunion
on June 12, 1879, feeling that the plans to ob-
tain funds to build a stone memorial of
Thayer for placement on the Plain were ‘‘im-
practical,’’ Cullum proposed that a smaller
monument be built over Thayer’s grave.
However, in his address at that reunion,
Cullum’s classmate Francis H. Smith, Class
of 1833, the first Southern graduate to speak
before AOG members, implored graduates
not to forget the original monument plan,
saying, ‘‘He was a noble specimen of West
Point character, and I trust the scheme will
not be abandoned of putting, in enduring
marble or bronze, a colossal statue of Brvt.
Brig. Gen. Sylvanus Thayer, the father of
the U.S. Military Academy.’’
A year later, at the 11th Annual Reunion,
George Andrews, Class of 1851, Treasurer of
the Thayer Monument Fund, reported that
all but $160 of the funds needed for the monu-
ment remained uncollected. The project was
further delayed when the committee hired
the New England Granite Company ‘‘to exe-
cute a statue eight feet three inches high,
standing upon a well-proportioned pedestal
of eight feet, both of pure white granite,’’
and the cost jumped to $4,000. To raise
money to cover the escalating cost, Cullum
reportedly addressed ‘‘personal letters to
each living graduate who has a diploma
signed by General Thayer.’’ In his June 10,
1882 Thayer Monument Committee report to
AOG’s Executive Committee, Cullum noted
that the statue would be ready by winter,
‘‘in ample time to be erected before the Re-
union of this Association in June 1883’’ (it
was completed on June 9, 1883, which would
have been Thayer’s 98th birthday). At the
14th Annual Reunion on June 12, 1883,
Cullum furnished a final report on the
Thayer Monument to the Association, saying
the statue ‘‘is worthy of the great Super-
intendent, whose majestic port [sic] and in-
tellectual visage [it] so faithfully represents;
and it is worthy of this Association which
has preserved, amid so many difficulties, to
raise such a memorial to the ‘Father of the
Military Academy.’ ’’ Showing its apprecia-
tion for Cullum’s efforts to bring the Thayer
Monument to fruition, the Executive Com-
mittee unanimously passed a resolution that
thanked him for admirably performing his
duties.
A year after erecting Thayer Monument,
AOG moved on to its next order of major
business, another project that took years to
materialize and one that ultimately de-
pended greatly on Cullum. At the 15th An-
nual Reunion in 1884, John S. McCalmont,
Class of 1842, proposed that Congress should
be petitioned to make an appropriation for
the purposes of furnishing a hall for AOG use
at West Point, given that the Association
had received so many gifts of manuscripts,
portraits, books, letters, and more and had
no room to safely keep them or exhibit
them. The matter was tabled and reintro-
duced three years later at the 1887 meeting,
but members felt that the USMA Board of
Visitors would have better luck securing the
funds from Congress for building such a hall
than their resolution. ‘‘The Association of
Graduates cannot raise the necessary
money,’’ Charles Braden, Class of 1869, AOG’s
Secretary at that time, flatly stated. Then,
given the lack of reference to it in meeting
notes, the Executive Committee seems to
forget about this idea for a memorial hall for
half a decade, but Cullum did not forget.
Upon his death, Cullum bequeathed $250,000
to the U.S. government for the purposes of
erecting a such a hall at West Point.
According to a March 7, 1892 New York
Times article reporting on his will, Cullum’s
gift, ‘‘Follow[ed] an idea which he had for
some years entertained.’’ Part of that idea
likely involved Cullum’s 1891 proposal that
Executive Committee incorporate the Asso-
ciation under the laws of New York state.
The committee unanimously adopted
Cullum’s proposal and filed a certificate of
incorporation in November of that year. As
some have hypothesized, Cullum proposed
this idea because he had already made his es-
tate plans, and, rather than gift his consider-
able fortune to what might be characterized
as an informal fraternal club, he wanted to
leave it to an organization with legitimacy
and longevity. Furthermore, showing his
prescience, Cullum explicitly stated in his
will for the memorial hall to be built ‘‘at far-
thest within five years after my death’’ (per-
haps because he witnessed no movement on
an idea that originated in 1884!). Cullum’s be-
quest was formally accepted by an act of
Congress, and the architectural firm McKim,
Mead & White was appointed in 1894 to de-
sign the building. Construction began in 1896,
with the cornerstone being ceremoniously
laid on April 15, and construction was com-
pleted on December 21, 1898. After it was fur-
nished (Cullum also left $20,000 in his will for
this purpose), the hall was dedicated on June
12, 1900, the date of the 31st Annual Reunion.
According to a July 1900 article by Charles
Larned, Class of 1870, in Junior Munsey Mag-
azine, ‘‘This hall is distinctly a monument to
West Point and all that it stands for, given
by a son of the Academy to his brother alum-
ni and their well beloved mother; designed to
commemorate their deeds, to preserve their
names, and to bear witness to the enduring
work of the foremost military school of the
age.’’
Thirty-one years after its founding, the As-
sociation of the Graduates of the U.S. Mili-
tary Academy had 473 members on its rolls,
and those members now had a home at West
Point. In his will, Cullum indicated that it
was his desire that the gifted memorial hall
be used for ‘‘the Assemblage and Dinners of
the Association of Graduates of the United
States Military Academy, and, if prac-
ticable, I wish that lodging accommodations
should be provided in some part of it for the
members of that Association while attending
its annual reunions.’’ Furthermore, they now
had funds. Cullum’s will also provided $10,000
for ‘‘the current and necessary expenses’’ of
the Association. This is the genesis of what
is now known as the West Point Association
of Graduates’ ‘‘Long Gray Line Endow-
ment.’’ While Cullum was Chairman of
AOG’s Executive Committee, AOG’s balance
sheet consistently ran between $1,000–$1,500,
but, thanks to his gift, it grew by 300 percent
in one year.
At the turn of the 20th century the Asso-
ciation, now with a home and with funds,
started to focus on growth and account-
ability. This began with two notable changes
to the Association’s Constitution and By-
laws. First, in 1897, the Executive Committee
decided that an elected graduate, rather that
the oldest graduate, would serve as the Asso-
ciation’s President, and voted accordingly to
change Article III of the Constitution. They
nominated George Greene, Class of 1823, to

be President, and he was unanimously elect-
ed (ironically, Greene was also the oldest
graduate on the Association’s membership
roll). Then, at the 1900 Annual Reunion, the
Executive Committee voted to amend the
Bylaws so that initiation fees were reduced
from a one-time $10 payment to an initial $2
fee with an additional $1 paid each subse-
quent year for the next decade. The prorated
fee cycle spurred growth in new membership.
In 1898, only three graduates elected to pay
the prescribed $10 initiation fee; in 1902,
more than 70 paid the new $2 fee. New mem-
bership also fostered more graduate partici-
pation. In 1899, only seven members attended
the 30th annual reunion, but in 1902 report-
edly some 350 graduates returned to West
Point for the annual alumni reunion.
During the dedication of Cullum Hall,
Alexander S. Webb, Class of 1855, who was
present in Webster’s office at the original
May 22, 1869 meeting, looked back on that
historic day and gave a brief account of the
organization of the Association. No records
exist of his remarks, but it is easy to imag-
ine he would have said that the 15 graduates
who gathered to form an ‘‘Association of the
Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy’’
would be proud that, 31 years later, their
idea had figuratively and literally found a
home, that more and more graduates were
coming back to that home each year, and
that the Association was continuing to pro-
mote the social intercourse and fraternal fel-
lowship of USMA graduates.’’

HONORING MR. BILL SMITH ON
BEING NAMED OCEAN COUNTY’S
TEACHER OF THE YEAR BY THE
NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF
EDUCATION
HON. ANDY KIM
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Mr. Bill Smith, a dedicated and en-
thusiastic educator who has worked as a pub-
lic school teacher for the past 11 years and
was recently named Ocean County’s Teacher
of the Year by the New Jersey Department of
Education for his work as a Social Studies
teacher at Southern Regional Middle School.
Mr. Smith is a leader and a mentor in a
classroom that values teacher-student collabo-
ration, critical thinking, and character develop-
ment. A product of the New Jersey public
school system himself, his enthusiasm as an
educator stems from a lifelong love of history
and teaching. In his own words, Mr. Smith
tries to make history come to life in his class-
room in order to foster the same passion in
his pupils. This, combined with his keen ability
to build an exceptionally strong rapport with
his students creates a dynamic and engaging
classroom environment that has led to a nota-
ble score increase in interdisciplinary
summative assessments among his classes.
Recognizing the importance of a holistic edu-
cation, Mr. Smith works vigorously to collabo-
rate with the other teachers at Southern Re-
gional to develop interdisciplinary educational
opportunities.
A lifelong learner, Mr. Smith continuously
explores new educational opportunities for
himself as well. Combining his love of learning
with a passion for travel, he has journeyed
from Dallas where he studied President Ken-
nedy to Scotland to study the Enlightenment.
A testament to his educational efforts, Mr.
Smith has been published in academic, peer-
reviewed journals as well as awarded various
summer learning grants.
Perhaps the most telling testament to Mr.
Smith’s life and career, is the informal con-
versations with his students that reveal that
deep admiration for their teacher as well as a
genuine excitement for his class. Mr. Smith’s
work as an educator thus far serves as a
great example to teachers throughout the
country regarding the power of applying dy-
namic instruction and building strong, positive
relationships with students. I thank Mr. Smith
for his service to our nation’s young people
and congratulate him on his well-deserved
recognition as Ocean County Teacher of the
Year.

RECOGNIZING SHAUN LIVINGSTON
FOR HIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE
PEORIA COMMUNITY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Mr. Shaun Livingston for his will-
ingness to invest in the Peoria community
where he grew up. Mr. Livingston is a 31-year-
old point guard for the National Basketball As-
sociation’s Golden State Warriors.
Mr Livingston recently made a one-million-
dollar donation to his elementary school,
Concordia Lutheran School, in Peoria, Illinois.
The veteran point guard’s generosity will be
put towards expanding the school. Specifically,
the expansion will consist of a performance
stage for band and theater, a renovated gym,
new offices and locker rooms and a storm
shelter. As a former athlete, I understand the
amount of hard work and commitment it takes
to have a career as successful as Mr Living-
ston’s. I am grateful for his passion to give
back to the community and am confident his
selfless actions will help provide young stu-
dents with the opportunity to succeed. His
leadership demonstrates to kids everywhere
that they too can follow their ambitions and
reach their goals.
Dedicated leaders like Mr. Shaun Livingston
make me especially proud to serve Illinois’
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I
would like to again formally thank Mr. Shaun
Livingston on his investment in the Peoria
community, and commend him on his kind-
ness and generosity.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
DAVID DACKE
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
express sincere gratitude to World War II vet-
eran, husband, and father, Mr. David Dacke.
David was born on September 11, 1927 in
Houston, Texas. He met the love of his life
Letha at the age of six when his parents told
him he was to walk the new little girl on the
block to school for her first day. David took
her to class and showed her around, leading
years later to their marriage. David learned to
weld at the Parker Brother shipyard, a talent
he would use in the Navy.
At the age of eighteen, David courageously
answered the call to serve and defend his
country. While in the Navy, he served on the
USS Evans and swam in the beautiful blue
waters of the Bikini Atoll before it later was the
site of atomic bomb testing.
In 1947, David returned home from the
Navy. When he left home, Miss Letha was a
girl, but she had become a young lady by the
time he returned. The two sweethearts were
married on March 26, 1949. They had two
children, Darrell and Diana. This year David
and Letha will celebrate their 70th anniversary.
After the war, David worked as a welder
building barges in a ship yard. He also was in
the chicken business where he supplied eggs
to Houston schools and businesses. David re-
tired and moved to Livingston in 1993, where
he and Mrs. Letha still reside.
David Dacke has demonstrated his dedica-
tion to the United States of America. It is with
great admiration that I thank him for his self-
less service to our country.

On Wednesday, March 6, 2019, the Cou-
gars won the state championship game
against the Treutlen Vikings by a score of 69–
67. This historic victory marked an undefeated
season for the Cougars as well as their sec-
ond state championship. The team also placed
No. 1 in the MaxPreps Class A Basketball
rankings for Region 1 and for the state of
Georgia with a Region win-loss record of 19–
0.
Their victory in this year’s state champion-
ship follows years of frustration, hard work,
and determination bursting forth into an in-
credible season of teamwork and athletic ex-
cellence. The perseverance of these Cougars
was shown this year in their exciting victory.
Moreover, the team completed this spectac-
ular season with an astonishing overall win-
loss record of 32–0.
I cannot put into words the tremendous
pride that the citizens of Edison, and indeed
the entire Second Congressional District, have
in being able to call this outstanding team of

HONORING THE GENERAL BAPTIST
DEACONS ASSOCIATION
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing the Greater Baptist Dea-
cons Association (GBDA) for its outstanding
spiritual work in the District of Columbia.
The GBDA has been an instrumental part of
the faith community in the District for 100
years. The GBDA has supported spiritual de-
velopment through meaningful Bible study,
leadership training workshops, youth edu-
cation opportunities and other community en-
richment initiatives over the years. The GBDA
has promoted social, economic and civic jus-
tice for all citizens and religious institutions.
In 1919, the GBDA was formed to unite the
faith community across the Washington metro
area, to more effectively spread Christian
teachings and to provide quality community
programs. In 1939, the members of the GBDA
were instrumental in starting the National Bap-
tist Deacons Convention, bringing together
members of the spiritual community to better
serve and strengthen the fellowship of church-
es.
The GBDA was instrumental in expanding
spiritual leadership training across two dozen
states and territories, providing a mechanism
for spiritual leaders to share common experi-
ences and offer support to various commu-
nities. Together with regional elected leaders,
the GBDA helped raise awareness for national
and social issues over the years, which led to
changes in the nation’s conscience.
The GBDA members and leaders have
worked with various corporations and business
entities to address issues such as homeless-
ness, affordable housing and workers’ rights.
They have worked collaboratively with commu-
nity partners on programs supporting civic, so-
cial and community development.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in celebrating the Gen-
eral Baptist Deacon Association on its 100th
year of service to the District of Columbia.

HONORING STEWART RESNICK FOR
RECEIVING THE BAKERSFIELD

VIDUAL PHILANTHROPIST OF
THE YEAR AWARD
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor and recognize Mr. Stewart
Resnick as the recipient of the 2019 Bakers-
field College Foundation Individual Philan-
thropist of the Year Award.
Stewart is the chairman and president of
The Wonderful Company, a multi-billion dollar
global company known for its iconic brands
like Wonderful Pistachios, Wonderful Halos,
POM Wonderful, and FIJI Water, to name a
few.
The Wonderful Company empire began in
1978 when Stewart and his wife Lynda
Resnick purchased a parcel of California Cen-
tral Valley farmland. Since then, Stewart has
overseen all financial, legal, real estate, strat-
egy, human resources, and business oper-
ations for the company. Under his guidance,
Wonderful has become so successful that
every year, nearly half of all American house-
holds purchase their products.
The Wonderful Company has continuously
given back to the communities where its em-
ployees live and work—contributing an aver-
age of $50 million annually to community de-
velopment efforts, educational programs, and
a comprehensive employee health and

sionate about free market sustainability, and
has made significant investments in sustain-
ability research, including implementing ad-
vanced irrigation technologies, extensive solar
installations at Wonderful facilities, and uti-
lizing fuel cells to generate electricity without
combustion or air pollution. Additionally, Stew-
art founded the Resnick Sustainability Institute
at the California Institute of Technology
(Caltech), which focuses on innovative science

Even outside of The Wonderful Company,
Stewart’s philanthropy is far-reaching. Among
his generous contributions are The Milken In-
stitute’s Lynda and Stewart Resnick Center for
Public Health, the Stewart and Lynda Resnick
Neuropsychiatric Hospital at the UCLA School
of Medicine, the Resnick Program for Food
Law & Policy at the UCLA School of Law, and
the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Exhibition Pa-

Stewart’s generous philanthropic efforts
make him a well-deserving recipient for the

and I want to thank him for his many selfless
contributions to the communities and citizens
of the Central Valley.

RECOGNITION OF MAJOR SEAN M.
DONOHUE
HON. DENNY HECK
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. HECK. Madam Speaker, today I recog-
nize Major Sean M. Donohue of the United
States Army for his extraordinary dedication to
duty and service to our Nation. Major
Donohue will soon transition from his current
assignment as an Army Congressional Liaison
in the House of Representatives to serve as

tial Military Training at the US Army Training
and Doctrine Command. This unit is the larg-
est charged with training all initial entry Sol-
diers in the Army.
A native of Tacoma, WA, Sean began his
military career after graduating from the Uni-
versity of Puget Sound, enlisting after the 9/11
attacks as a medic in 2002. Sean was com-
missioned in 2009, completed his clinical train-
ing as a Physician Assistant at Fort Carson
and promptly deployed to Afghanistan as a
Battalion Surgeon with the 173rd Airborne Bri-
gade Combat Team. Since then, Sean has
served in numerous leadership and staff posi-
tions around the world. His wife is a dedicated
military spouse, Lexey, and they have three
boys: William, Jack and Maximus.
In 2017, Army Medicine selected Major
Donohue to serve as Legislative Liaison to
serve in the Army House Liaison Office. In his
role as a legislative liaison, Major Donohue
served as the primary liaison between Mem-
bers of the 115th and 116th Congresses, their
Staff, Legislative Committees, and the U.S.
Army. In this role, he planned, coordinated,
and accompanied Congressional and Staff
Delegations on numerous worldwide fact-find-
ing and investigative missions and built the re-
lationships and trust needed to increase the
trust and confidence the U.S. Congress has in
the U.S. Army.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize
the selfless service of Major Sean M.
Donohue and his family as they proceed to
the next chapter in his remarkable career as
they continue to serve our great Nation.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN
HENRY HAGGINS
HON. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of John Henry
Haggins, who passed away recently at 102
years of age.
John was born in Raleigh, NC on February
15, 1917 to Dorsey McAllister and William
Haggins. John grew up in Raleigh with seven
siblings and first moved to his eventual home,
Washington, D.C, in the 1930s, following his
older brothers to find work.
His natural skill and ingenuity led John to a
long and storied career in engineering and
construction. He worked with C.W. Freitag
Construction Co. and George Hyman (now
Clark) Construction Co., moving to cities in
West Virginia, South Carolina and New York
throughout that career. While his time in West
Virginia was spent doing some of the hardest
work of his professional life, it was well worth
the effort when he met his future wife, Lorene
Epps. The pair were married on September
14, 1945 after a long courtship and remained
together until John’s passing, raising four chil-
dren in the Northeast Washington, DC home
that John would later build by hand.
After more than 30 years of hard and dedi-
cated work, John retired from Clark Construc-
tion Co. as the Concrete Superintendent in
1987. He remained a member of the Opera-
tive Plasterers & Cement Masons, America’s
oldest building and construction trades inter-
national union.
Over the course of his 102 years, John and
Lorene built a large and loving family that will
continue to carry his legacy, including children
Shirley, Phyllis Joann, Cynthia Jean, Pamala
Francine, and John Anthony; five grand-
children; three great-grandchildren; and three
great-great-grandchildren.

CELEBRATION OF THE GI BILL’S
75TH ANNIVERSARY AND ITS AU-
THOR SENATOR ERNEST ‘‘MAC’’
MCFARLAND
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in celebration and honor for the 75th anniver-
sary of the GI Bill as well as the bill’s co-au-
thor, the late Arizona Senator Ernest ‘‘Mac’’
McFarland. Officially titled the ‘‘Servicemen’s
Readjustment Act of 1944,’’ the GI Bill pro-
vided a slew of benefits for veterans returning
from World War II. These new benefits were
available to every veteran who had been in
active duty for ninety days and they continue
to this day. The benefits bestowed onto our
veterans include low-cost mortgages, low-in-
terest loans, payments for tuition and living ex-
penses to attend university college of voca-
tional education and up to one year of unem-
ployment compensation. With this bill, we’ve
been able to offer a small token of our grati-
tude to those who put their lives on the line in
order to defend everything we hold dear. The
assistance cemented in the GI Bill is thanks,
in large part, to the former Majority Leader
from Arizona Ernest McFarland. Mac’s accom-
plishments stretch far beyond his work on the
GI Bill. As it stands today, he is the only per-
son in Arizona’s history to have served as
U.S. Senator, Governor of Arizona and Chief
Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court. He was
a leader for our state and his tireless efforts
enabled so many wonderful opportunities for
our uniformed men and women. I am proud to
honor this man and his diligent work for our
veterans.

CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF READING AND BEYOND
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the local non-profit organization Read-
ing and Beyond of Fresno, California as it
celebrates its 20th anniversary. Since its cre-
ation in 1999, Reading and Beyond has been
a leader in the community, providing edu-
cational, health and wellness opportunities to
underserved families of Fresno County. The
impact Reading and Beyond has had over the
past two decades continues to be felt by
countless families in the Central Valley.
In the fall of 1998, members of the First
Covenant Church called together leaders of
the community to explore prospective solu-
tions to help neighborhood students struggling
with reading. Reading and Beyond was found-
ed with the belief that a child’s path toward a
brighter future was paved with books. Initially,
Reading and Beyond provided tutoring and
parenting programs for 30 families in need.
Eventually, it expanded to include cradle-to-
career services for both children and their par-
ents, health services and tailored programs to
help families increase their social mobility and
strive for success and self-reliance.
Since its founding, Reading and Beyond has
earned many honors both locally and nation-
ally. In 2003, Fresno Unified School District
praised Reading and Beyond as a ‘‘model for
other organizations’’. In the same year, it was
chosen as one of only four organizations to re-
ceive national funding from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education to develop its Early Child-
hood Education program into a replicable
model. In 2008, Kerri Briggs, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education Assistant Secretary for Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education, recognized
Reading and Beyond as a ‘‘remarkable exam-
ple of the impact that faith-based organiza-
tions have in a community’’. In 2015, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture awarded $12 million
dollars in pilot funding to Reading and
Beyond’s Fresno Bridge Academy program;
one of only ten national projects to receive this
grant.
What started out as a community-led effort
to help neighborhood children in Fresno de-
velop their reading abilities, has evolved into
an organization that serves the needs of chil-
dren and families across seven counties in
California. Reading and Beyond has com-
mitted to empowering families to achieve pro-
ductive lives through its holistic, research, and
results-based programs with the end goal of
helping children succeed.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing Reading and Beyond as it
celebrates twenty outstanding years. Our com-
munity is forever grateful for the contributions
Reading and Beyond has made in the Central
Valley. I ask that you join me in wishing Read-
ing and Beyond long-lasting success.

IN HONOR OF THE 2018–2019 AAAA
STATE CHAMPIONS: THE CARVER
TIGERS BOYS BASKETBALL
TEAM
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the 2018–2019 AAAA
Boys Basketball Georgia State Champions,
the George Washington Carver High School
Tigers of Columbus, Georgia. The team com-
memorated this significant milestone on Sun-
day, March 17, 2019, with a celebratory pa-
rade followed by a celebration of honor at the
Columbus Civic Center.
On Friday, March 8, 2019, the Tigers won
the state championship game against Amer-
icus-Sumter High School by a score of 58–55.
This was the fifth game of the season against
the Americus-Sumter Panthers and it was an
exciting end to their series. The Tigers took
the lead for a second and final time in the
game with 28 seconds left. This historic victory
marked the first championship for the Tigers
since 1971.
Their victory in this year’s AAAA state
championship follows years of frustration, hard
work, and determination bursting forth into an
unbelievable season of teamwork and athletic
excellence. The perseverance of these Tigers,
after placing No. 3 in the MaxPreps AAAA
Boys Basketball rankings for Region 1, was
clearly shown by a spectacular season.
I cannot put into words the tremendous
pride that the citizens of Columbus, and in-
deed the entire Second Congressional District,
have in being able to call this outstanding
team of athletes their own. They have accom-
plished an incredible feat, one that could not
have been possible without the tireless leader-
ship and encouragement from their head
coach, Warren Beaulah and his staff, as well
as their families, classmates, and members of
the community who believed in them and their
ability to bring home a state championship
title.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more
than 730,000 people of Georgia’s Second
Congressional District in congratulating and
honoring these hardworking young men who
have persevered, sacrificed, and achieved the
pinnacle of success in basketball—the Geor-
gia AAAA State Championship title.

HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor and recognize Aera Energy,
and President and CEO, Christina Sistrunk, as
the recipient of the 2019 Bakersfield College
Foundation Corporate Philanthropist of the
Year Award.
Industry-leading oil and gas producer Aera
Energy has displayed its commitment to Cali-
fornia and the communities in which it oper-
ates for nearly 100 years. Jointly owned by
Shell and ExxonMobil but operated as a
stand-alone company with its own board and
managers, Aera is proudly based in Bakers-
field, California and in Kern County, one of the
largest oil-producing regions in the entire
country. Innovative approaches to engineering,
lean processes, and data quality helped Aera
become a titan of industry—Aera produces
about 125,000 barrels of oil and 32 million
cubic feet of natural gas each day, accounting
for nearly one-quarter of California’s oil pro-
duction annually. However, its community in-
volvement and philanthropy are what truly sets
them apart.
Aera actively encourages their employees to
participate in events and causes that strength-
en communities, recognizing individual em-
ployees who go above and beyond in this re-
gard. Through various programs like Partner-
ship A.E.R.A. (Achieving Excellence, Reward-
ing Academics), the Community Reading
Project, and multiple high school programs,
Aera employees are heavily involved in the
communities where they live and work. In ad-
dition to these volunteering and mentoring ef-
forts, Aera donates to over 100 community or-
ganizations each year.
Bakersfield is fortunate to have a premier oil
and gas producer like Aera so dedicated to
the betterment of its people and community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. WING
MAR
HON. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the life of Dr. Wing Mar,
esteemed doctor, beloved husband, father,
and former member of the Torrance-South
Bay YMCA Board of Managers.
Dr. Wing Mar was born on January 15,
1924 in China and immigrated to the United
States as a very young child with his family.
After serving with the 10th Army Corps as an
intelligence member of the 711th Tank Bat-
talion headquarters during World War II, he at-
tended University of California, Berkeley, and
later graduated from the University of South
Dakota Medical School.
Dr. Mar had a long and impressive career in
medicine while also serving for many decades
as a leader in his local YMCA. He has always
been an important member of his community,
working to improve medical care for the elder-
ly, participating as a member of Physicians for
Social Responsibility in the 1980s and becom-
ing a charter member of the Chinese Historical
Society of Southern California in Los Angeles.
It was thanks to Dr. Mar’s fundraising skills
that the Chinese Historical Society was able to
financially secure a Los Angeles headquarters
in two beautiful historical homes in Chinatown.
He will forever be remembered for his work as
a doctor and volunteer with a desire to make
an impact in his community and beyond.
Dr. Mar is survived by his wife Joyce, their
children Jeff, Gayle and Carolyn, six grand-
children, and four great-grandchildren whom I
hope take comfort in the way he lived his life
as a healer, a community leader and compas-
sionate citizen. May his memory be a blessing
to us all.

RECOGNIZING GENERAL ANDREW
J. GOODPASTER
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, March 21, 2019
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I
want to recognize the following letter sub-
mitted to the Daily Herald newspaper by my
constituent Frank G. Splitt of Mount Prospect,
Illinois. Mr. Splitt rightly acknowledges the
contributions to our nation made by General
Andrew J. Goodpaster, who amongst other
things, served as the Supreme Allied Com-
mander, Europe, and superintendent of West
Point. I encourage all my colleagues to learn
about the contributions made by this leg-
endary general from Illinois.
[From the Daily Herald, Mar. 9, 2019]
AN ILLINOISAN TOO IMPORTANT TO IGNORE
(Letter to the Editor, Opinion)
In a recent Wall Street Journal column,
‘‘Five Best Books on American Generals’’
Winston Groom recommended works about
military leaders. C. Richard Nelson’s book,
‘‘The Life and Work of General Andrew J.
Goodpaster,’’ was conspicuous by virtue of
its absence from Groom’s list—so too was
the absence of General Goodpaster from the
Herald’s March 3, 2019 supplement, ‘‘Illinois’
Rich History, People Places & Things that
Make Illinois Stand Out.’’
Readers of Nelson’s biography will find
that Goodpaster (1915–2005), born in Granite
City, Illinois, graduated from West Point in
1939. He was a soldier, engineer, and scholar
who led and fought with uncommon valor in
World War II, advised several presidents,
most notably President Dwight D. Eisen-
hower, and served as NATO’s Supreme Allied
Commander, Europe (1969–1974). He has been
called the finest officer of our era.
Goodpaster was brought out of retirement
in 1977 to serve as the superintendent of West
Point as it was reeling from a cheating scan-
dal. In his four-year tenure at the academy,
he sought to substitute ‘‘positive leadership’’
for hazing and personal abuse.
Subsequent to Goodpaster’s government
service, among other things, he served as the
Chairman of the George C. Marshall Founda-
tion and as a senior fellow at the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars. He
was the recipient of the Presidential Medal
of Freedom, by President Reagan in 1984, for
‘‘lifetime accomplishments that changed the
face and soul of our country.’’
Goodpaster’s approach to analysis and de-
cision making provides valuable lessons for
current and aspiring leaders. His life story
should serve as an inspiration to others who
are challenged with the task of resolving
complex domestic and foreign policy issues.
It has been said that General Goodpaster re-
mains ‘‘too important to ignore.’’
FRANK G. SPLITT,
Mount Prospect.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF

HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS

Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
remember Dorothy Geraldine Noak Rothermel
who passed away on March 1, 2019 in Pasa-
dena, Texas.
Dorothy Geraldine Noak Rothermel was
born December 20, 1929 in Carmine, Texas to
Herbert and Clara Keng Noak. Dorothy grad-
uated from Round Top-Carmine High School
in 1947. On December 28th of that year,
Dorothy married Thomas Hugh Rothermel of
Burton, Texas.
Ms. Rothermel attended Blinn College in
Brenham; Southwest Texas State College in
San Marcos; and graduated from the Univer-
sity of Houston in 1961 with a Bachelor of
Science Degree in Vocational Home Econom-
ics. She also did graduate work at the Univer-
sity of Houston and at the Sacred Heart Do-
minican College in Houston.
Dorothy worked for Southwestern Bell Tele-
phone in Houston and New Braunfels as a
Switchboard Operator. In 1963, Dorothy start-
ed teaching at Pasadena High School. Her ca-
reer at Pasadena High School spanned twen-
ty-four years where she served as Department
Chairman and a Classroom Teacher in the
Vocational Homemaking Department. After re-
tirement, she served as a substitute teacher at
Round Top-Carmine High School for several
years.
Dorothy held memberships in the Texas
State Teachers Association, Vocational Home-
making Teachers of Texas, Texas Retired
Teachers Association as a Life Member,
Washington County Genealogical Society, the
German-Texas Heritage Society, Brenham
Area Retired School Personnel Association,
and the Texas Wendish Heritage Society.
Ms. Rothermel loved to research and write
articles on the family history of the Noak,
Keng, Hinze, Rothermel and Vogelsang fami-
lies. She served on various committees help-
ing to further her interest in genealogy, includ-
ing the Fayette County History Book and the
100th Anniversary History Book of Martin Lu-
ther Lutheran Church in Carmine.
In retirement, Dorothy served as a member
of Martin Luther Lutheran Church, President of
the Ladies Aid, Secretary for the Church
Council, and Secretary of the General Board
for the Women of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America (WCLA).
Dorothy is survived by her Daughters:
Connie Sue Rothermel Bird and husband,
Marshall, of Splendora, and Pamela
Rothermel Guthrie and husband, James, of
Pasadena; Granddaughters: Rachel Diana
Bird Poffinbarger and husband, James, of
Splendora, Johanna Ruth Bird, of Houston,
and Moriah Ashlee Guthrie, of Pasadena; and
Great-Granddaughters: Camille Poffinbarger,

ber the life of Dorothy Geraldine Noak
Rothermel. May God comfort her family at this

Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor and recognize Mrs Jerry
Ludeke as the recipient of the 2019 Bakers-
field College Foundation Service Medal.
Jerry’s passion for academia can be traced
back over half a century to her days as an un-
dergraduate at Indiana University After grad-
uating, Jerry began teaching at a junior high
school before returning to school to complete
a Masters in Fine Arts at Tulane University in
New Orleans, where she concurrently taught
several undergraduate courses. Upon comple-
tion of her Masters, Jerry selflessly decided to
serve as a missionary for the Presbyterian
Church in Beirut, Lebanon, at the then-named
Beirut College for Women. Increased hos-
tilities in the Middle East cut the mission short,
and Jerry returned to school once again— this
time as a graduate student at Stanford Univer-
sity There, she met fellow Stanford graduate
and Army veteran, John Ludeke.
Jerry and John married in 1959 and settled
in Bakersfield, California, where they quickly

became involved in the community. Both edu-
cators, John taught at Bakersfield High School
while Jerry held multiple positions at Bakers-
field College before leaving to raise her two
boys, Kevin and Scott. Although she did not
formally return to teaching until the boys start-
ed high school, Jerry remained committed to
her role as an educator, and founded the Vol-
unteer Tutoring Program at Bakersfield Col-
lege. In 1975 she returned full-time to the Ba-
kersfield College Learning Center, where she
worked until she and John retired together in
1994.
Jerry’s commitment to community service is
just as impressive as her academic history.
Over the years she developed and served as
the first secretary for the Holloway-Gonzales
Library in Bakersfield, volunteered at the
Friendship House pre-school, served as the
president of the Kern County Historical Soci-
ety, served on the board of both the Kern Me-
morial Society and Friendship Force, and di-
rected the Bakersfield College Archives. Such
extensive community involvement would over-
whelm almost anyone, but for Jerry these are
just the tip of the iceberg.
The Bakersfield College Foundation Sterling
Silver Medal recognizes Jerry’s lifelong com-
mitment to hard work and the betterment of
the Bakersfield community’ through the power
of education. Her input on various boards and
councils, and her leadership at Bakersfield
College, has had an immeasurable impact on
the lives of countless people. On behalf of
California’s 23rd Congressional District, I want
to thank Jerry for her leadership and philan-
thropy to the communities and citizens of the
Central Valley.

Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Bradley University Men’s
Basketball Team on capturing the Missouri
Valley Conference title, earning them a spot in
the 2019 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.
The Braves defeated Northern Iowa Univer-
sity in St. Louis by a score of 57–54 to cap-
ture an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament
and finish off a stellar Missouri Valley Con-
ference tournament. Bradley pulled off an out-
standing comeback in the second half after
trailing by as many as 18 points with only 17
minutes left in regulation. This title is the first
the Braves won since 1988 and will be their
first NCAA Tournament appearance since
2006, where they made a thrilling run to the
Sweet Sixteen. As a former athlete, I under-
stand the amount of hard work and commit-
ment it takes to put together such an out-
standing season. They are an example of the
importance of dedication and a strong work
ethic. I am proud there is such young talent in
our community, and to see them represent Pe-
oria so well throughout the state and country.
I will be rooting them on in the NCAA Tour-
nament and wish them continued success.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
the Bradley University Braves Men’s Basket-
ball Team that I am especially proud to serve
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate the Bradley University Braves Men’s

HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER
OF ILLINOIS

Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate UL as they celebrate
their 125th anniversary this month and to rec-
ognize their important role empowering trust in
the safety, security and sustainability of prod-
ucts, organizations, and supply chains.
Most consumers will recognize the familiar
UL Mark that appears on more than 22 billion
products, likely including some of the appli-
ances, electronics, and other goods in your
home. This recognized mark is a symbol that
the product has demonstrated conformance to
UL’s internationally-recognized standards of
safety.
As an approved Nationally Recognized
Testing Laboratory by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA), UL tests
and certifies certain equipment found in U.S.
workplaces and has improved safety for count-
less American workers.
The district I represent is proud to be the
home of UL. Their Northbrook, Illinois head-
quarters employs more than 1,800 people, but
the company’s reach is truly global.
A century and a quarter after their founding
as Underwriters Laboratories in Chicago, the
company now operates across 143 countries
worldwide, touching 20 industries, and em-
ploying more than 14,000 individuals.
Each year, over 2 billion consumers—nearly
a third of the planet’s population—are touched
by UL safety messages.
Despite their immense growth and influence,
UL remains true to its founding principle to
‘‘promote safe living and working environ-
ments.’’ I wish the team at UL many more
years of success improving safety and em-
powering trust over the next century.

Thursday, March 21, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today

company, Drake Cement, has an incredible
safety record, and is known for its pursuit of
excellence and its proud relationships with its
employees and the community.
The industry at issue is the aggregate in-
dustry (sand, gravel, iron, minerals, stone and
other aggregates) for use in the manufacturing
of cement and concrete. Drake Cement takes
raw materials, including limestone, alumina,
iron and silica, and blends, heats, crushes and
grinds it into the best cement west of the
Rockies. The cement Drake Cement produces
is used for construction products, including
mortar, concrete, and masonry. You will find
cement in buildings, dams, bridges, highways,
floors, wells, pipes and a host of other nec-
essary products. Without cement you cannot
have modem construction and infrastructure.
Drake Cement was awarded the Sentinel of
Safety Mining Award in 2017 and 2015 by the
National Mining Association. This prestigious
award is given to mines that have the highest
and best safety records. In a business that in-
volves dangerous equipment, heavy weight
transport and moving parts, maintaining safety
is not easy and it requires constant vigilance
and high levels of training and awareness.
Drake Cement has been awarded this difficult
recognition twice and the plant was only built
in 2011.
Outside a small town called Paulden, Ari-
zona, Drake Cement built its new state of the
art facility. The company takes seriously its
commitment to social responsibility. It recog-
nizes that, as a mine and manufacturer, it has
an impact on the environment, but it also rec-
ognizes its impact is positive, necessary and
undeniably important to our culture, our soci-
ety and our modern economy.
I thank Mr. David Chavez, its Vice Presi-
dent, the over 120 employees who do their
best every day, and the company for its con-
tribution to Arizona and the country.
