DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,
May 16, 2019.
I hereby appoint the Honorable SHEILA
JACKSON LEE to act as Speaker pro tempore
on this day.
NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
f

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by
the majority and minority leaders for
morning-hour debate.
The Chair will alternate recognition
between the parties. All time shall be
equally allocated between the parties,
and in no event shall debate continue

COMMUNITY ACTION MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize May as Community Action Month.
This year marks the 55th year since
the Community Action Network was
established to help American families
and communities overcome obstacles
to poverty. There are more than 1,000
Community Action Agencies across the
country that reach children and fami-
lies in 99 percent of America’s counties
to help provide life-changing services
that create pathways out of poverty.
Every year, these agencies help tens
of thousands of children and youth
with before- and after-school programs;
more than 165,000 unemployed people
get a job; almost 220,000 families find
safe and affordable housing; and about
6.5 million people, including seniors,
make their homes more energy effi-
cient and lower their utility bills.
Earlier this spring, I was proud to in-
troduce H.R. 1695, the Community
Services Block Grant Reauthorization
Act of 2019, with Congresswoman
BETTY MCCOLLUM.
This bill renews our Nation’s com-
mitment to reducing poverty through
locally driven, comprehensive ap-
proaches.
Madam Speaker, the Community
Services Block Grant traces its roots
back more than 50 years ago to the
Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. This
act established local Community Ac-
tion Agencies to help identify why peo-
ple were in poverty and how to address
it using public and private resources, a
great public-private partnership.
These agencies act as a safety net for
low-income individuals and families.
Even more importantly, they help cre-
ate opportunities for people to move
from poverty to independence. That is
the true measure of success as we look
at these Community Action Agencies.
The Community Services Block
Grant is the only Federal program with
the explicit goal of reducing poverty,
regardless of the cause. Unfortunately,
this program has not been reauthorized
in more than 20 years.
Our bill makes important updates
that will strengthen the Community
Services Block Grant and the network
it supports, including:
A new federally administered Com-
munity Action Opioid Response Grant
that will enable Community Action
Agencies to fill service gaps and re-
spond to unmet needs of low-income in-
dividuals, families, and communities
affected by the opioid or substance
abuse crisis;
A provision requiring Federal ap-
proval of State applications and plans,
with provisions to allow direct Federal
funding of local agencies if a State
plan fails to meet Federal require-
ments; and
A renewed commitment to stream-
lining the program’s stated purpose to
reduce poverty through support for
Community Action Agencies that im-
prove economic security for low-in-
come individuals and families and cre-
ate new opportunities in the commu-
nities where they live.
This bill will help more than 15 mil-
lion low-income Americans and provide
resources necessary to help lift individ-
uals and families out of poverty.
Madam Speaker, it is time to reau-
thorize the Community Services Block
Grant, and I urge all my colleagues to
support this bill, especially during
Community Action Month.

NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, it is my privilege to be recognized
by you for this 5 minutes.
Madam Speaker, I rise, and still I
rise, because I love my country and be-
cause I believe that no one is above the
law.
We say that quite religiously here in
this institution: No one is above the
law.
I have in my hand the ‘‘Report on the
Investigation into Russian Interference
in the 2016 Presidential Election.’’ This
document, known as the Mueller re-
port, has been released to the public for
some 29 days now.
Since its release, we have had many
persons, many of whom are Members of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3846 May 16, 2019
this august body, say that they have
concluded that the President has com-
mitted impeachable acts. Some have
gone so far as to say that he should be
impeached. I am one of them.
We have also had hundreds of law-
yers, many of whom are prosecutors
and former prosecutors, say that if
anyone else committed the offenses
outlined in this document, the Mueller
report, that person would be arrested
and prosecuted. That person would be
prosecuted. That person would not be
above the law.
Hence, since this document addresses
acts by the President, since the Presi-
dent is not being prosecuted, and since
the House of Representatives has not
moved to impeach the President, one
can conclude that the President is in-
deed now, for some 29 days, above the
law.
No one is above the law, unless you
are the President.
No one is above the law. The House of
Representatives has a duty to enforce
the law.
The President of the United States of
America, it has been said by constitu-
tional scholars, by Members of this au-
gust body, and by lawyers—hundreds—
that he is subject to the law and that
he should be properly prosecuted.
It is not happening.
The prosecution of the President in
the House of Representatives will take
place once impeachment is initiated.
Until impeachment is initiated, this
President is above the law. He con-
tinues to obstruct. He is above the law.
I am using this refrain because it is
important for the American public, the
people who understand that no one is
above the law, to at least see that we
have a problem. We have a President
who, by most standards, has com-
mitted impeachable acts, yet we have
not started the impeachment process.
If the President is not impeached,
one of two things will happen: one, he
won’t be impeached; or, two, the Con-
gress of the United States of America
would become a toothless paper tiger,
not only as it relates to this President,
but also as this relates to future Presi-
dents.
We cannot allow the perception of
the Congress to be toothless when it
comes to our constitutional respon-
sibilities. We have a duty, a responsi-
bility, and an obligation to bring the
President to justice.
The bar of justice for this President
and any other President is this House
of Representatives, and each Member
of this House has the responsibility to
make sure that justice is served.
I will now start a process that will
commence on the second anniversary
of my initial call for the impeachment
of this President, which will be tomor-
row. Tomorrow will be the second anni-
versary, and I will start a process to-
morrow of bringing to this floor a dis-
play.
We will display the number of days
since the Mueller report was produced
and the number of days that this Presi-
dent has gone above the law because
until the President is impeached, those
who say that he should be impeached,
those who say there is evidence enough
to impeach, until this President is im-
peached, we who say this must con-
clude that he is above the law.
I love my country. I stand on the law.
I believe in the Constitution. As such,
I believe that this House has a duty
and a responsibility to take up im-
peachment.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
AMERICA LEADS THE WAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I
appreciate the warnings to not men-
tion the President, but you know what?
They are going to continue to come.
They won’t be heeded.
People say they have respect for the
rule of law. Do they even have respect
for the House rules and the dignity
that we have as leaders of our country
to follow those rules?
How can we ask the American people
to follow rules we pass when we don’t
follow the rules even on the House
floor?
Madam Speaker, I know you under-
stand this. My heart is heavy because I
sit here, prepared to speak about one
thing, but I feel like I have to say that
I am very concerned for my country
when my colleagues on the Democratic
side speak of socialism as if history
isn’t littered with examples of failure,
of destitution, of destruction of not
only the economies of countries that
go down that road of ruin but what it
does to their people.
We see this in the most recent exam-
ple of Venezuela. How can we be talk-
ing about these big-government, social-
ist ideas like the Green New Deal?
Even Speaker PELOSI calls it a fantasy.
When colleagues on the other side
aren’t talking about giving Washington
more control over the American peo-
ple’s lives, they are talking about
party over country, unpatriotic rhet-
oric, in my opinion, and political the-
ater.
That is the agenda. That is what they
have. That is the bold vision of where
they want to take this country. Not
me, and not the people of west Texas. I
can promise you that.
I mentioned the Green New Deal as
the Democrats’ signature legislation to
steward the environment. They want
to eliminate airplanes, ladies and gen-
tlemen. They want to eliminate cows.
They want to give everybody a pay-
check, guaranteed income whether you
work or not. Whether you are capable
of working or not working, everybody
ought to get a paycheck, guaranteed,
full faith and credit of the United
States of America.
That is where this country would go
if we didn’t have a Republican Senate,
if we didn’t have a Republican Presi-
dent, and if we didn’t have Americans
with better sense.
Look, is the climate changing? Yes,
it is changing. What are the factors?
What are the variables? How serious?
Which variables are contributing over
the others?
Let me tell you what is real. What is
real is the responsibility we have to
steward our environment.
I want clean air and water for my
three children. I think, as leaders of
this great country, we ought to be re-
sponsible for providing not only a land
of opportunity for the future of our
children but a clean land of oppor-
tunity.
Let’s just get the facts straight for
the American people. America has been
leading the way in this regard. The
Clean Air Act is one example.
We had six key pollutants that we
identified, in a bipartisan way, that
had an impact on our health and well-
being in this country. We have reduced
those pollutants by 73 percent since
1970. At the same time, we have grown
this economy 230 percent.
America is leading the way. In green-
house gases, from 2005 to 2017, U.S. en-
ergy-related emissions fell by 14 per-
cent when the rest of the world in-
creased their emissions by 20 percent.
Folks, through American innovation,
through reasonable regulations, we
have been able to lead the world and
provide for a cleaner environment and
steward God’s great Earth, a gift to us.
We do have a stewardship responsi-
bility. We have a calling to our creator
and our children.
I don’t want the American people to
be misled, certainly not at a $93 tril-
lion cost and a plan that eliminates
cows and airplanes. Give me a break.
The committee of jurisdiction, the
Energy and Commerce Committee,
hasn’t even taken up that legislation.
But that is what they have.
I hope we can work in a balanced
way. I hope we can find ways to con-
tinue to do what we are doing, which is
to steward our resources, provide for a
cleaner environment for our children,
and at the same time, make sure that
we have opportunities for our kids to
pursue their dreams and dream big and
do better for their families because
just talking about dirty fossil fuel is
not enough of a plan.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF SEYMOUR ‘‘SY’’ KAPLAN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes.
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Seymour Kaplan,
known as Sy, a local hero and World
War II veteran who passed away on
April 19 at the age of 95.
Sy was born on February 28, 1924, to
Morris and Fannie Kaplan. At just 17
years old, Sy enlisted in the U.S.

Army—17—and, boy, was his father
mad. But from a young age, Sy didn’t
let anything get in the way of serving
others.
During World War II, Sy served this
country bravely in the 2nd Army 2nd
Corps Division under General George S.
Patton.
Sy fought for 3 years, advancing
through Italy, France, and Germany.
Sy was severely wounded while build-
ing a bridge to cross the Rhine River
into Germany. For his heroism, Sy
earned three Battle Stars and two Pur-
ple Hearts.
But Sy’s service to our Nation did
not end with his military service. Sy
was a lifelong advocate for our local
veterans. For 25 years, Sy served as the
commander of the Disabled American
Veterans Chapter 78 in the Coachella
Valley. His leadership helped countless
veterans find healing, community, and
a sense of purpose. Over the years, Sy
also helped many homeless veterans
find homes and jobs. Sy would show up
to every townhall, every event, and
every community forum, always ready
to make his voice heard.
Shortly after I became a Member of
Congress, I remember Sy knocking on
my door and asking: ‘‘Who is this
young guy? What does he know about
veterans?’’
I sat down with Sy, and I imme-
diately recognized his expertise and,
more importantly, his heart. That is
why I asked Sy to serve on my veterans
advisory board and help my office con-
nect veterans with the healthcare and
benefits they have earned and deserve.
Sy said: ‘‘Hell, yeah. Let’s do this.’’
When Sy came to our meetings, he
would often bring along a veteran in
need, and before we started the day’s
agenda, Sy would give that veteran the
space to tell their story. That was Sy
Kaplan: a devoted advocate who recog-
nized that good leaders also have to be
good listeners.
Sy became one of the visionaries be-
hind Veterans University, my annual
event to connect veterans with local
and Federal resources. Among his
many accomplishments, Sy was instru-
mental in bringing the Palm Desert VA
Clinic to the Coachella Valley. Sy
would often visit the clinic to, in his
own words: ‘‘Make darn sure all of my
vets from the Coachella Valley are get-
ting good care.’’
Last year, it was my honor to present
Sy with the Shirley Powell award in
recognition of his service to local vet-
erans in our communities. I looked to
Sy as a trusted adviser and a dear, dear
friend.
Sy was preceded in death by his be-
loved wife, Doris, and his daughter
Ellen. He is survived by his daughter
Ilona and a loving community grateful
for his leadership and compassion.
I will always remember Sy’s blue Dis-
abled Veterans of America shirt, his
baseball cap, his energy, and his infec-
tious smile. In Sy’s honor, let’s make
‘‘darn sure,’’ as he would say, that we
carry his memory in our hearts.

COMMENDING PRESIDENT TRUMP
FOR NOT WAIVING THE JONES
ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. BABIN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise
here today commending President
Trump for not waiving the Jones Act.
This is a hypothetical picture, thank
goodness, a Chinese-built vessel, sub-
sidized by their communist regime, op-
erated by the Chinese, and delivering
Chinese goods, all in the very heart-
land of the United States of America.
But this could easily become a reality
if the Jones Act is waived.
For the past 100 years, the Jones Act
has brought strength and certainty to
maritime commerce here in the United
States. It has protected the rights of
American sailors, created and main-
tained American jobs, and been one of
the single largest factors in facili-
tating the strong American economy
that we are enjoying.
The Jones Act states that goods
shipped between U.S. ports are to be
built, owned, and operated by the citi-
zens of the United States, and to sup-
port the Jones Act would be an easy
decision to continue promoting the pol-
icy of America first.
To waive the Jones Act would be to
directly jeopardize our national secu-
rity, our economic growth, and our
ability to provide American jobs all
across this country. Worst of all,
waiving the Jones Act would be allow-
ing these foreign-operated ships into
our waterways and could be opening
the door to espionage. These foreign
vessels would have the potential to lit-
erally threaten our national security
by exposing our waterways to very real
threats.
Not only has the Jones Act played a
vital role in economic growth, but it
has and continues to play a very large
role in disaster recovery and the efforts
of emergency response. Take a look at
the photos of New York City after the
attack on 9/11. You will see the Hudson
River and the East River full of Amer-
ican vessels who quickly came to the
rescue. Or how about all of the supplies
delivered to the coastal communities
after catastrophic hurricanes?
The list goes on to include the clean-
ups of oil spills, fires, and nautical ac-
cidents. Americans are always there,
and the Jones Act makes that possible.
The Jones Act creates stability and
certainty to the maritime and shipping
industry. Taking away the Jones Act
strips this industry of job and market
availability and stability, handing it
over to foreign countries to cheaply fill
the role through questionable labor
practices and lower standards of per-
formance. It would singlehandedly
jeopardize one of the Nation’s most re-
liable and strongest of our economic
drivers.
As a conservative Republican, I am
well aware that many groups and
thought leaders here in Washington
and back in Texas, whom I respect and
agree with on most of the other issues,
do not share my view on the Jones Act,
and they are actively working to try to
weaken or even repeal it.
I respectfully, but firmly, disagree,
and that is why I am calling on any
and all of my colleagues who want to
repeal the Jones Act to explain why
the image that they see here would
make for a better and stronger Amer-
ica.
If they need to borrow this poster, I
will be glad to let them use it. Just let
me know.

CONGRESS MUST BE INVOLVED
AND ENGAGED
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
RUIZ). The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE)
for 5 minutes.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
have had the privilege of serving in
this august body, and serving the
American people and the people of the
18th Congressional District.
Just a few minutes ago, I was at Ar-
lington Cemetery participating in the
wreath-laying ceremony for the women
of the United States military, those
who have fallen in battle, and recog-
nizing young and new women members
of the United States military.
In fact, Sergeant Kelly, whom I hon-
ored, is in combat, having been given
permission to be engaged in combat
since 2015 by the Pentagon and the
United States Defense Department.
That means that I have the greatest re-
spect for all of these men and women
and take very seriously the issues of
war and peace.
I was here in the United States Con-
gress during the heinous and dev-
astating attack on this Nation on 9/11.
I was here for Afghanistan and Iraq,
the Kosovo war, the Bosnian war.
Every one of those war zones I visited.
I saw the men and women sacrifice. I
take very seriously this issue of war.
I am very concerned with the efforts
now in the waters in the Mideast, with
the intelligence that is alleged by the
administration that is coming and this
saber-rattling that is occurring, be-
cause the lives of our men and women
will be put in harm’s way.

briefing today, the Members of the
United States Congress, those who care
about national security, homeland se-
curity, be briefed as to why our vessels
are there, others are headed there, and
the allegations or suggestion that
120,000 troops will be moving in that di-
rection.
America is strong. We have no fear,
but we have always been a defender,
not an offender. Iran is not just any old
country in the Mideast. Shamefully, we
disengaged from the Iran nuclear
deal—wrong decision, evidenced by
what is happening today.
You cannot backdoor conversations.
You have to show yourself willing to
negotiate with leaders from the posi-
tion of facts and knowledge.
I can’t stomach the frivolous engage-
ments and noninformation that is
translating into our men and women
put in harm’s way. We must be in-
volved and engaged.
So I ask the administration to do so
posthaste. I ask that we move forward
with knowledge of what is going on,
and each and every Member of this
body and the other body should be
knowledgeable about this point.
I return to a local issue that has
bothered me, and as a member of the
Judiciary Committee, I want the fam-
ily of Pamela Turner, who is now de-
ceased, to know that I stand with
them.
I do not give a blanket assessment of
the great law enforcement we have in
this Nation, but I am appalled at the
shooting death of an African American
woman, Black woman, shot down in
cold blood in the streets.
Yes, this lady was walking her dogs
in her apartment complex. There are
suggestions that this individual was
well-known to police and that there
were some mental health issues, some-
thing that we have to fight against and
give resources. Unfortunately, she was
with warrants.
I have no quarrel with people doing
their job; but you are in your home,
your apartment, walking your dogs,
any other means could have been uti-
lized to pick you up on warrants. You
are not going anywhere. We know your
address. Through an unfortunate inter-
action, altercation, the gun was taken
out by a law enforcement officer, and
she was shot five times—not once to
wound, but five times.
So this requires, for the comity of re-
lationships and respect, a full Federal
and State investigation—we cannot
hide—just as I have indicated that
shooting on Harding Street, recently,
by officers requires a thorough and full
investigation, which is going on right
now.
So I would simply say that because
we are the land of the free and the
brave, we are adherents to the Con-
stitution and democracy and dignity
and justice for all, this is an untenable
and unacceptable act, that I could be
walking my dogs, unarmed, and I pro-
ceed into an unfortunate circumstance
which included a Taser, but then it re-
sults in the absolute ending of my life,
and I may be a person who needed men-
tal health assistance.
I am deeply troubled to learn of the death of
the Pamela Shantay Turner, who was shot
and killed by a Baytown Police Officer. She
was a mother of three children, and she died
the day after Mother’s Day.
In the investigation following Ms. Turner’s
death, the officer indicated that he was patrol-
ling as part of his duty, and recognized Ms.
Turner from ‘‘prior dealings’’ and proceeded to
commence an arrest but she resisted. Nothing
in the record suggests any wrongdoing by Ms.
Turner prior to this chance encounter with
Baytown Police. Reports suggest the officer
attempted to arrest Ms. Turner. The officer al-
leges Ms. Turner reached for his Taser and a
lieutenant with the Baytown police claims that
Ms. Turner actually tased the officer. Accord-
ing to the Baytown Police Department, the offi-
cer fired his duty weapon and struck multiple
rounds at Ms. Turner. The shooting was re-
corded by a civilian and caught on cell phone
video. After her death, it was revealed that
Ms. Turner suffers from serious mental ail-
ment. Prior to her death, Ms. Turner, 44, was
heard stating that she was pregnant. After her
death, this was determined not to be the case.
I stand with the family of Pamela Turner.
We must get to the truth; the facts and we will
not relent until justice is served. The cir-
cumstances surrounding Ms. Turner’s death
are shocking and I demand a state and fed-
eral inquiry into her death. First, what predi-
cate did the officer involved have in detaining
Ms. Turner? Why were no efforts made to de-
escalate the controversy so that it did not end
in a loss of life? And, if Ms. Turner was known
to law enforcement in prior dealings, did they
not also know about her mental state? In re-
cent months, we have seen too many in-
stances of these types of killings. During Na-
tional Police Week we honor our officers and
I abhor attacks on our brave law enforcement
personnel. As a member of the House Judici-
ary Committee, I look forward to working with
law enforcement to protect justly our citizens
and them. This disturbing act should not have
happened and should never be repeated.

HONORING TROOPER MATTHEW
GATTI
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to honor the in-
credible life of Trooper Matthew Gatti
of the Tennessee Highway Patrol.
On May 6, 2019, just a week or so ago,
while responding to a call for help on
Interstate 40 in Tennessee, Trooper
Gatti was killed in the line of duty.
Matthew Gatti will be remembered in
west Tennessee and in our entire Na-
tion as a dedicated public servant, a
husband, a son, a brother, and a friend
to all.
Although just 24 years old, Trooper
Gatti had an incredible, an impressive
career in public service. He served with
the Madison County Sheriff’s Office in
Jackson, Tennessee, and then began
working for the Tennessee Highway
Patrol.
In addition to serving others, Mat-
thew was passionate about hunting,
about baseball, about comedy, and he
was an active member of his church,
Gospel Light Baptist Church, in Jack-
son, Tennessee.
Trooper Gatti lived a life that very
few people have the honor of living.
According to those who knew him
the best, Trooper Gatti’s willingness to
serve and his constant sacrifice for oth-
ers was of second nature to him.
He exemplified duty and service both
on and off the clock, and for that, I am
truly grateful.
Matthew had a deep love for his
church, and his strong faith could be
seen in everything that he did. His
friends described him as a humble gen-

Matthew was a blessing to our com-

Trooper Gatti died doing what he
loved doing: protecting people, pro-

the State of Tennessee. And although
his life on Earth has ended, his legacy
will live on.
My thoughts are with his family,
with his friends, and with the men and
women of the Tennessee Highway Pa-

I also want to thank all the men and
women in uniform who risk their lives
each and every day to protect all of us
for our safety and for our betterment.
Matthew Gatti will never be forgot-

Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam

KUSTOFF for yielding.
Madam Speaker, most of us run away
from danger, but our law enforcement,
they run toward it.
Last Monday, Tennessee State
Trooper Matthew Gatti was killed in
the line of duty responding to a car fire
on I–40.
I had the privilege of knowing this
young trooper. Our families were dear
friends.
This young man was just 24 years old,
but he lived a life of exemplary service
to us all.
Matthew’s father said that he died
doing what he lived for: serving God
and serving others.
We honor those who pay the ultimate
sacrifice for freedom. We honor this
young man for his commitment to our
safety. We honor his family for raising
a young man who would serve us all in
such a way.

gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.
NORMAN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the late Emily Carnes,
a former resident of South Carolina’s
Fifth District who dedicated her life to
the preservation of the historic Buford
battlefield.
The Battle of Buford was significant
and momentous in the southern cam-
paign during our Revolutionary War.
113 Continental troops perished during
this struggle and another 150 suffered
terrible wounds.
Witnessing this carnage was Emily
Carnes’ great-great-grandfather, Jacob.
Emily would go on to tell her ances-
tor’s story in her book, ‘‘Jacob Was
There’’.
The book describes Jacob Carnes,
who was 16 years old at the time, and
on the fateful day of May 29 of 1780,
Jacob was employed plowing in a field
close to the historic site when the Con-
tinental troops under Colonel Abraham
Buford clashed with the British forces
led by Lieutenant-Colonel Banastre
Tarleton.
Jacob hid behind a tree during the
struggle, but was eventually discovered
by British troops, who took him into
custody. While in their custody, Brit-
ish troops commanded Jacob to bury
an American soldier alive. Jacob re-
fused.
In reply, a British soldier fired his
musket and shot off one of Jacob’s fin-
gers, therefore, adding Jacob’s name to
the long list of patriots who gave their
blood for our freedom.
In remembrance of her great-great-
grandfather’s traumatic experience and
the historic importance of the battle to
the southern campaign, Emily Carnes
singlehandedly cared for and preserved
the 2 acres of leaf and debris-filled bat-
tlefield for years. She did this with no
support and very few means. Indeed,
she couldn’t even afford to fly a flag in
remembrance of those who gave their
life for our independence.
Finally, in 2010, the Friends of Buford
Massacre Battlefield was established,
and Ms. Carnes was awarded an hon-
orary member.
Thanks to Ms. Carnes’ lifelong ef-
forts, the former 2-acre site now en-
compasses over 47 acres of surrounding
land on which the battle was fought,
with the site now proudly flying the
Stars and Stripes, the Buford Battle
flag, and the State flags of Virginia
and South Carolina.
The site now also includes modern
comforts like a patio, walkways, infor-
mational kiosks, and a memorial
bronze plaque inscribed with the names
of 216 men recognized for defending
their country in the Battle of Buford.
We thank Ms. Carnes for her lifelong
passion and dedication to this sacred
soil and for preserving this moment in
a State and Nation’s history for all of
us to remember and enjoy.
WE CAN PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF
LGBTQ INDIVIDUALS AND RELI-
GIOUS LIBERTY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Utah (Mr. CURTIS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to speak about the Equality Act.
First and foremost, I must begin by
saying that I believe the LGBTQ com-
munity is a critical part of the fabric
of our country. They are deserving of
our unequivocal love and respect, and
their contributions to my home State
of Utah are utterly invaluable.
As the mayor of Provo, I prioritized
inclusion and love, and sought to en-
sure my administration did everything
possible to recognize the intrinsic
value of all of our citizens, including
our LGBTQ community.
I fought hard against discrimination
and was grateful for my associations
with organizations like Provo Pride,
Equality Utah, Encircle, and others,
who I was honored to stand with to en-
sure that our city motto of ‘‘Welcome
Home’’ extended to everyone.
Perhaps even more important than
that, I am grateful for the association
and relationships of my life that have
helped me better understand the expe-
riences of the LGBTQ community, and
who have been patient with me, a con-
servative Utah boy raised in the 1960s,
who took longer than I am proud of to
gain empathy for this important issue.
Again, I say I am incredibly grateful
for the contribution of the LGBTQ
community and will always stand with
them in respect and support.
With the Equality Act, we face a
unique challenge: balancing the needs
and protections against discrimination
with the importance of protecting reli-
gious liberty, which is one of the fun-
damental rights enshrined at the foun-
dation of our Nation.
I believe this compromise is possible,
because I have seen it before in my
home State with historic legislation
called the Utah Compromise that effec-
tively balanced the absolute rights of
both LGBTQ individuals as human
beings and religious institutions pro-
tected by the First Amendment.
The Equality Act fails to strike that
balance. Instead, these two interests
are treated as zero sum games, with no
good-faith effort put forth for both
sides to win.
This bill would end longstanding reli-
gious liberties under the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act, a historic bi-
partisan legislative victory fought for
by the current Democratic leader in
the Senate, CHUCK SCHUMER; my own
Utah mentor, Orrin Hatch, a Repub-
lican; and liberal icon, Ted Kennedy. It
was also signed into law by Democrat
Bill Clinton.
I have introduced commonsense
amendments that would help achieve
this critical balance of protection for
both maintaining the standards
against discrimination and religious
freedom, but I am frustrated that
House Democratic leaders have decided
there will not be any consideration or
even debate of amendments to the
Equality Act. Instead, they have estab-
lished a model of legislative gas-light-
ing.
In this case, they are taking issues
where broad bipartisan agreement is
possible and taking the debate right off
the table on issue after issue, whether
it be climate change, violence against
women, and now the Equality Act.
They disregard willing partners, such
as myself, standing here hoping to
work with them, and instead, prefer to
pass party-line bills that won’t go any-
where so they have issues to campaign
on.
If my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle truly want to achieve
progress on this issue, I hope they will
recognize that they have a willing
partner in me, but they must be willing
to work together to legislate and make
room to protect both religious liberty
and the LGBTQ community.
Exploiting yet another group in order
to pass a campaign message bill along
party lines is not in harmony with this
body.
I hope they will hear me today and
change course before we vote on this
bill.

RECOGNIZING JUSTIN MASSIELO
AND EMELIE CURTIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize two impres-
sive student athletes from Bucks Coun-
ty, Pennsylvania, who are making
their school and our entire community
very proud.
Justin Massielo and Emelie Curtis,
students at Pennsbury High School in
Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, both re-
cently hit impressive milestones in
their respective sports.
Justin, a senior, recently recorded
his 100th hit as a 4-year starter for the
Falcons’ varsity baseball team, and
Emelie, a junior, just notched her 100th
career goal as a 3-year starter for the
Falcons’ varsity girls lacrosse team.
What makes their achievements even
more special, Madam Speaker, is that
Justin and Emelie also are cousins.
On behalf of our entire community, I
would like to congratulate Justin and
Emelie on their notable athletic
achievements. We wish them, and their
families continued success.

town before joining his hometown’s po-
lice force in 1990.
Throughout his entire tenure in Bris-
tol Township, Terry became a senior

tions, and he was a driving force in
public outreach.
Madam Speaker, I had the oppor-
tunity to personally work with Lieu-

We thank our friend, Terry, for his

ST. MICHAEL’S EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH
CELEBRATES 150TH ANNIVERSARY
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize a faith com-
munity in Bucks County, Pennsyl-
vania, that recently celebrated a very
special milestone.
St. Michael’s Evangelical Lutheran
Church in Sellersville commemorates
its 150th anniversary this year.
First commissioned in 1869, St. Mi-
chael’s was to be a union church be-
tween Reformed and Lutheran Chris-
tians. Nearly 2,000 people attended one
of St. Michael’s consecration cere-
monies.
The church is rich with tradition and
history. Early sermons were spoken in
German, and in 1904, the church be-
came the first building in Sellersville
to have electricity.
Today, the St. Michael’s community
is as active as ever, participating in
community meals, working on commu-
nity gardens, and providing food for
Pennridge FISH and Keystone Oppor-
tunity Center, and offering numerous
educational programs.
Madam Speaker, we congratulate the
St. Michael’s faith community on their
150th anniversary of such an amazing
and special place.
I would also like to thank Pastor
Julie Bergdahl for her pastoral care
and leadership.

PRAYER
Rabbi Bruce Lustig, Washington He-

offered the following prayer:
Eternal God, without whom life has
no spiritual source, no divine meaning,
purpose, or destiny, but with whom
there is power for the present and hope
for the future, refresh our faith that
the strains of life may not break our
spirits. Restore our confidence that our
world is undergirded by eternal pur-
pose.
Bless those who give service of heart
to this great Nation. Give them
strength to temper their judgments by
the compassion of the human soul.
Know that none are free until all are
free, free from fear, want, bigotry, and
callous hatred of the other. Let the
courage of their convictions make
America worthy of her past and blessed
by her future.
Let not cynicism blight, nor faith-
lessness uproot our confidence to live
as we pray, so that, unashamed, our
leaders may transmit to generations to
come an America better than ours.
Hear our prayer.
Amen.

WELCOMING RABBI BRUCE LUSTIG
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. RASKIN) is recognized for 1
minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
honor Rabbi Bruce Lustig, who just led
us in this wonderful opening prayer.
Rabbi Lustig is senior rabbi of the
Washington Hebrew Congregation,
which is Washington, D.C.’s largest and
oldest synagogue and where many of
my constituents worship.
The son of a refugee from Nazi Ger-
many, his mother, Hedy Lustig, Rabbi
Lustig grew up in Nashville, Tennessee,
where he was often the only Jewish
child at school. The strong cultural
identity instilled by his mother, and
the emphasis his family placed on en-
gaging with his Christian friends and
classmates, laid the foundation for his
lifelong commitment to interfaith
work, including his efforts to open dia-
logue and strengthen relationships
among Jews, Christians, Muslims, and
people of all faiths.
Ordained at the Hebrew Union Col-
lege-Jewish Institute of Religion,
Rabbi Lustig holds a doctorate of di-
vinity and a master’s degree in Hebrew
letters. He earned his bachelor’s with
honors from the University of Ten-
nessee.
In delivering today’s opening prayer
in the House, Rabbi Lustig continues a
venerable and important tradition.
Since the Washington Hebrew Con-
gregation was created in 1862, every
single one of its senior rabbis has deliv-
ered an opening prayer before the U.S.
Congress. Rabbi Lustig now joins that
esteemed group.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to wel-
come Rabbi Lustig to the House today,
and I would like to extend my thanks
for his excellent leadership in our com-
munity and for offering today’s prayer.

CELEBRATING HEAD START AND
COMMEMORATING THE MEMORY
OF DR. EDWARD ZIGLER
(Mr. LARSON of Connecticut asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate
the Head Start program on its 54th an-
niversary and the 25th anniversary of
Early Head Start.
I had the proud distinction of serving
with Dr. Edward Zigler of Yale Univer-
sity, who passed away this past year.
He was a leader in this and worked
with every President from JOHN KEN-
NEDY to Barack Obama.
He is generally regarded as the father
of the Head Start program but also re-
garded for his longstanding work with
children. In fact, it was Ed Zigler who
said, ‘‘My politics are children,’’ and
then proceeded to dedicate a lifetime
to creating remedies for childcare,
which he labeled, in America, ‘‘a cos-
mic crapshoot.’’
So many young people today experi-
ence the dilemma of balancing their
work with bringing up their children.
But it was Ed Zigler’s leadership that
recognized we should utilize our
schools. He promoted School of the 21st
Century as a way for us to get our arms
around the whole issue of having safe,
affordable childcare.
I rise today to commemorate his
memory and congratulate the Head
Start program.

PASS A DISASTER
SUPPLEMENTAL BILL
(Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico asked and was given permission to
address the House for 1 minute and to
revise and extend her remarks.)
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I think it is urgent
for Congress to approve the disaster
supplemental bill.
Although I welcome the House
version, I am still waiting on the Sen-
ate side to work a final solution.
The more that passage is delayed, the
longer our communities will wait be-
cause just passing the appropriation is
the beginning of a drawn-out process.
I know my constituents are still
waiting for the $600 million for the Nu-
tritional Assistance Program that I
have long been advocating. That will
cover the gap in funding under the sup-
plemental appropriations we made im-
mediately after Hurricanes Irma and
Maria.
As of last month, those residents who
have not fully recovered are already
seeing a decrease in benefits because
we have not yet passed the disaster
bill.
For example, 20 months later, of
some $42 billion allocated to Puerto
Rico, just $12 billion has been outlaid.
That means that we have work to do,
and this funding is still being reviewed
with great scrutiny from FEMA, HUD,
and OMB. That is the reason I do be-
lieve we should move across aisles to
make this happen.

LEGISLATING ON BEHALF OF THE
PEOPLE
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let
me, too, add my appreciation and con-
gratulations to Head Start, a very via-
ble program, not only in my district, as
I watched little children become em-
powered with education, but also
around the Nation. I congratulate all
of those who were engaged in its begin-
ning, and I thank them for their bril-
liance and their leadership.
I rise today to say that we are trou-
bled because the work of this body is to
legislate on behalf of the people of the
United States. We are, in fact, the peo-
ple’s House, and we have done our
work. We have passed disaster funding.
Those of us who are, if you will, the
remnants of various hurricanes in the
2017 season—in particular, those that
impacted the East Coast, Puerto Rico,
Houston, and the State of Texas—are
waiting for disaster funding, which we
have done.
We are waiting for the Violence
Against Women Act to be passed. We
are waiting for the universal back-
ground checks to be passed. We are
waiting for protecting people against
losing their preexisting condition cov-
erage and, of course, lowering prescrip-
tion drugs to pass. All that has been
passed in this House.
We are waiting as we begin to debate
the Equality Act that will have a blind
eye to anyone’s difference and be able
to celebrate them and support them
without discrimination.
Where is the other body? Why
haven’t they passed a bill in 3 months?
Why can’t we do the work for the
American people?
It is time to get the job done.

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.

highlighted by Peace Officers Memorial
Day, which President John F. Kennedy
designated, in 1962, as May 15.
Law enforcement officers and their
families selflessly serve our commu-
nities across the country. Americans
appreciate honoring officers, their fam-
ilies, and fallen heroes on Peace Offi-
cers Memorial Day.
Law enforcement personnel are na-
tional heroes. We are grateful for their
sacrifices made to serve and protect
our country on a daily basis.
We also provide our deepest support
and gratitude to those who have been
injured or lost their lives in the line of
duty and to their families. Grateful
citizens across the country will take
time to thank a police officer this
week.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the

STOP PRICE-FIXING ON GENERIC
DRUGS
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, last week, 44 attorneys gen-
eral filed a lawsuit in Federal court
against 20 generic drugmakers, alleging
market manipulation and price-fixing.
The American people’s tax dollars
are invested in unprofitable basic re-
search that is essential to bringing
highly profitable drugs to market. The
United States Government is also a
huge purchaser of these generic drugs.
In some cases, it is alleged that one
company sets the price of a drug and
the others follow, without the cost-cut-
ting influence of competition. All of
this resulted in billions of dollars in
harm to patients and the U.S. econ-
omy.
Congress must stop this price-fixing
scheme and will vote this week to ap-
prove legislation to end this price-fix-
ing and market manipulation perpet-
uated by these generic drugmakers.

ENACT THE JAKE LAIRD ACT OF
2019
(Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and

House for 1 minute and to revise and

Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, as we recognize National Police
Week, let’s provide our law enforce-
ment every tool possible to prevent
senseless acts of gun violence from
harming or claiming the lives of inno-
cent people, including our law enforce-
ment officers.
That is why, today, I am reintro-
ducing a gun violence reduction bill,
categorized as a red-flag bill, with my
colleague TED DEUTCH, who represents
Parkland, Florida, and our colleagues
from Michigan, FRED UPTON and
DEBBIE DINGELL.
Our bill, the Jake Laird Act of 2019,
is named after an IMPD officer who
paid the ultimate sacrifice serving and
protecting his community of Indianap-
olis, Officer Jake Laird.
Our bill provides grants to States to
enact laws substantially similar to In-
diana’s red-flag law because we know
that, since 2005, this Hoosier common-
sense bill has been working.
Specifically, the Jake Laird Act will
enable law enforcement to remove and
retain firearms from individuals who
are determined to be a danger to them-
selves or others, while ensuring due
process under the law.
According to a USA Today article re-
cently published, more than 30 States
across the country are either consid-
ering similar measures or have passed
red-flag laws.
It is past time for our Nation to
adopt laws like Indiana’s red-flag law
that will keep our law enforcement and
citizens safer.

WE DO NOT ALLOW
DISCRIMINATION
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was
given permission to address the House

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I am
here today to tell you about Gwyn
Ciesla of Aurora, Illinois. Gwyn is a
wife, a mother of two, and an IT profes-
sional with two decades of experience.
She is also a transgender woman.
Gwyn transitioned about 2 years ago.
Shortly afterward, she began inter-
viewing for jobs to advance her career.
Gwyn was met with hesitation from
potential employers. On multiple occa-
sions, recruiters were suddenly unin-
terested in Gwyn after they conducted
in-person interviews—no follow-up, no
phone calls or emails, just complete si-
lence.
This is a horrifying reality for many
people in the trans community like
Gwyn. A 2016 report by the National
Center for Transgender Equality found
roughly 30 percent of trans people have
been denied a job or a promotion, or
were fired, because of their gender
identity.

only hurtful and illegal, but it hurts
our economy, which is why groups like

so many others still forced to sit on
the sidelines, keeping top talent out of

Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to remember David King, an in-

mine who passed away after a hard-
fought battle with cancer on May 2.
David was born in Houston, Texas,
but moved to Virginia in 1995 and spent
over 2 decades there. He will be remem-
bered for his lasting contribution to
the Virginia wine industry and his
King Family Vineyards. It is one of my
favorite places for a glass of wine.
David served as a chairman of the
Virginia Wine Board and worked tire-
lessly as a free-market advocate for
vineyard agriculture and agritourism
in Virginia. He leaves an enormous leg-
acy in both the wine industry and his
local Crozet community.
David is survived by his loving wife,
Ellen; his six sons and daughters-in-
law, Carrington and Corie, Stuart and
Ali, James and Kelly; as well as his
eight grandchildren.
One of David’s favorite phrases was
this: ‘‘A rising tide lifts all boats,’’ and
David lived by that, lifting up those
around him in success.
We will miss him dearly.

Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor my nephew, Ian Jacob
Trone, who was born May 18, 1991. This
Saturday, he would have been 28 years
old. But on December 31, 2016, Ian died
alone in a hotel room from a fentanyl
overdose.
Ian was a nice young man. He, like
many of us, was destined to grow up,
find a partner, and start a family. He
was a huge sports fan, and like many
young boys his age, he had a sense of
humor, he was a friend to many.
But last year, 72,000 people died of an
overdose. Almost 70 percent of those
involved fentanyl. This is the most im-
portant issue in America today.
In Congress, we must be determined
to end this devastation, both Demo-
crats and Republicans.
Ian Jacob Trone left us too soon, and
I will do everything in my power to
make sure we don’t senselessly lose
more lives to this epidemic.

introduced the Abortion Is Not Health
Care Act. This bill amends the Internal
Revenue Service’s treatment of out-of-
pocket abortion costs as a medical ex-
pense.
This bill was drafted after receiving
feedback from my constituents that
they no longer wanted their tax dollars
to support the abortion industry.
It is unfathomable to me that my
Democratic colleagues in Congress con-
tinue to not only condone the practice
of abortion but allow taxpayer dollars
to subsidize this abhorrent practice.
For years, the pro-abortion move-
ment has marketed abortion as a form
of reproductive healthcare, but it is
time for us to be honest with ourselves.
Healthcare is primarily a restorative
function, one that helps our bodies and
minds to heal from disease or ailment.
Under no circumstances should
healthcare include the intentional tak-
ing of life.
The Abortion Is Not Health Care Act
is a small step towards ending the Fed-
eral Government’s treatment of abor-
tion as a healing medical practice.
I am happy that several of my col-
leagues and many pro-life groups, in-
cluding March for Life, Family Re-
search Council, Eagle Forum, Center
for Arizona Policy, Arizona Right to
Life, and others have endorsed this bill.
As Members of Congress, we have a
duty to protect life.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues
to uphold the call for human dignity at
all stages of life, including while still
in the womb, and support the Abortion
is Not Health Care Act.

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
(Mrs. AXNE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, Iowans are
struggling to keep up with the rising
cost of prescription drugs.
A teacher in Farragut, who has had
diabetes for 20 years, is spending over
$750 a month for insulin. That is a third
of her take-home pay, and she needs a
second job just to cover her costs.
A woman from West Des Moines
wrote to me that her medication used
to cost $50 for a 90-day supply and now
that price has gone to $1,000. Her fam-
ily found they can buy the same medi-
cation in Canada for $60.
In fact, Americans pay more for pre-
scription drugs than any other country
in the world. Brand-name drug manu-
facturers are gaming the system to
reap profits and they are using delay
tactics to prevent generic companies
from bringing the same drugs to mar-
ket.
I ran for Congress to protect Iowans,
not Big Pharma. This bill will help
bring generics to market quicker to
lower the cost for consumers and save
billions in taxpayer dollars.
No one should ever have to decide be-
tween putting food on the table and
taking their medicine.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
pass this legislation to lower the cost
of prescription drugs for all Iowans and
Americans.

RECOGNIZING JENNIFER BAUMANN
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jen-
nifer Baumann, a high school senior
from my district who was named the
recipient of the Good Citizen Award by
the Illinois Daughters of the American
Revolution.
This year, over 400 high school sen-
iors submitted essays for the DAR
Good Citizenship scholarship applica-
tion. Among these, district DAR chap-
ters identified one student as the per-
son who best exemplifies dependability,
service, leadership, and patriotism in
their area.
Jennifer was selected from Mt. Zion
High School as the representative for
the Stephen Decatur Chapter and at-
tended the Illinois State DAR Con-
ference, where she was named the
statewide winner of the Good Citizen
Award.
By all accounts, Jennifer dem-
onstrates well the attributes of depend-
ability, service, leadership, and patri-
otism. She is active in nearly every as-
pect of student life in her high school,
where she is the captain of all three of
her varsity teams: cross-country, bas-
ketball, and track and field. She also
serves as the President of the National
Honor Society and treasurer of the
Student Council, and even finds time
to dedicate to volunteering with both
the Key Club and her church.
She plans to study speech, language,
and hearing sciences at the University
of Arizona in the fall.
I am proud to recognize outstanding
students in my district, including Jen-
nifer. I congratulate her on this pres-
tigious honor.

HEAD START GIVES CHILDREN A

Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this week,

education, health, nutrition, social
services to low-income children and
their families. It is one of the most im-
portant investments that we can make
to make sure our children have the
greatest opportunities to succeed.
It is particularly important and cru-
cial to my hometown of Flint, Michi-
gan, where early childhood education is
the most important thing we can do to
help children mitigate the effects of
lead exposure.
I am really proud of the school dis-
tricts in Michigan who host this in-
credible program and provide wrap-
around services to children and to their
parents.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the teachers,
the workers, and the volunteers who
support our Head Start kids every day.
To keep Head Start working, we have
to fully fund this program in Congress.
Support for Head Start is bipartisan.
We need to continue that. We need to
make sure that we fully fund this pro-
gram.
I celebrate the success of Head Start.
We ought to make sure that every
child that seeks that sort of early
childhood education has an oppor-
tunity to have it.

HONORING BOB MAXWELL
(Mr. WALDEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to recognize the life of an Amer-
ican hero who I was honored to call my
friend, Bob Maxwell of Bend, Oregon,
who passed away last weekend at the
age of 98.
Bob Maxwell represented the best of
what Oregon and America had to offer.
Bob was the oldest living Medal of
Honor recipient in our country, and his
gallantry was well known.
On the night of September 7, 1944, in
France, Bob Maxwell threw his unpro-
tected body on top of a German hand
grenade to protect the lives of his com-
rades in World War II.
This unhesitating selflessness earned
Bob Maxwell America’s highest mili-
tary honor. It earned him his second
Silver Star, a second Purple Heart, and
a Bronze Star.
For those who had the pleasure of
knowing Bob, as I did, they know that
his bravery and heroism were only
matched by his kindness, his warmth,
his sense of humor, and his humility.
Bob once said of his Medal of Honor:
‘‘I am not wearing the medal for any
personal deeds. I am wearing it because
it represents all the casualties we had
in the war. It represents those who
were killed defending their country and
the ideals that they believed in.’’
Like his fellow soldiers, Bob’s service
will forever be cherished in the country
that he sacrificed so much to protect.
Bob’s legacy will live on in the hearts
and minds of everyone he interacted
with, and especially in his community
in central Oregon, where Bob Maxwell
was a pillar.
To the entire Maxwell family,
Mylene and I send our heartfelt condo-
lences and prayers during this difficult
time of loss.
f
URGENT NEED FOR
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Infrastructure Week
and call attention to the urgent need
for investment in rural areas like mine
in upstate New York.
As an example, every time I am home
in my district, I hear from folks about
the need to invest in infrastructure to
help our family farmers succeed.
When farmers drive their livestock or
dairy products down to New York City
or the immediately surrounding areas,
they need bridges and roads they can
rely on, structures that can carry prod-
uct without potholes or fear of col-
lapse.
But infrastructure does not just
mean bridges, roads, and seaports. It
means access to markets through high-
speed internet.
Astoundingly, 25 million Americans
lack rural broadband. This means 25
million Americans who own small busi-
nesses, operate small farms, want to
apply for college online, or do home-
work, or access lifesaving medicine
cannot, because they lack internet ac-
cess.
This week, I was proud to launch,
with the leadership of Whip CLYBURN, a
task force on rural broadband.
I am ready to partner with folks on
both sides of the aisle to address the
need to rebuild our infrastructure and
access broadband both in upstate New
York and across the country.
Let’s get this done.

MAY IS MENTAL HEALTH MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, May is Mental Health
Month, a time when we are encouraged
to break down the stigmas that sur-
round mental health.
Normalizing conversations about de-
pression, anxiety, and other conditions
will help those affected by mental ill-
ness seek the quality care that they
need and deserve.
One group that is overwhelmingly
impacted by mental health disorders is
veterans.
Unfortunately, we know that about
22 veterans commit suicide each and
every day.
Congress understands how dire the
situation has become and is working
diligently to find a solution. Fortu-
nately, we have made progress over the
past few years.
Last year’s passage of the VA Mis-
sion Act significantly increased the
care available to our veterans, ensur-
ing they have access to a medical pro-
fessional before resorting to suicide.
This is a step in the right direction,
but more can certainly be done.
These men and women answer the
call of duty, and as a Nation, we must
care for them when they return home.
Until veteran suicide rates dwindle
to zero, I will continue to work with
my colleagues to support veterans’
mental health programs.

The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall not exceed 90
minutes, with 60 minutes equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce, and
30 minutes equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-

egon (Mr. WALDEN) each will control 30
minutes, and the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. SCOTT) and the gentlewoman
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each
will control 15 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in
favor of H.R. 987, the Strengthening
Health Care and Lowering Prescription
Drug Costs Act. This legislation, Mr.
Chairman, is a big step in our commit-
ment to delivering on our promise to
make healthcare and prescription
drugs more affordable.
It brings together seven bills that
passed out of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee last month. Taken
together, these bills will strengthen
our Nation’s healthcare system, re-
verse the Trump administration’s sabo-
tage of the Affordable Care Act, and
help lower the costs of healthcare and
prescription drugs.
The first title of this bill contains
three bipartisan measures intended to
address high prescription drug costs by
promoting greater competition in our
pharmaceutical marketplace. One of
the most effective ways to bring down
the cost of prescription drugs is to en-
sure that generics can come to market
as soon as possible.
The first proposal would address so-
called exclusively parking, a practice
where a first-time generic is blocking
the approval of other generics from en-
tering the market.
The second proposal prohibits the use
of pay-for-delay agreements between
brand and generic drug manufacturers
that delay generic entry into the mar-
ket.
And finally, the third drug pricing
measure would address situations
where some brand drug companies are
delaying or impeding generic entry by
denying generic drug manufacturers
access to samples or to single, shared
system REMS.
By eliminating these three barriers,
we will prevent some manufacturers
from manipulating the system to ex-
tend their monopolies at the expense of
consumers, and this will make pre-
scription drugs more affordable for all
Americans.
Now, the second title of this bill, Mr.
Chairman, will help lower Americans’
healthcare costs, protect people living
with preexisting conditions, and re-
verse some of the most harmful actions
the Trump administration has carried
out to sabotage the Affordable Care
Act.
Two of the proposals will restore
funding for the navigator program and
outreach and enrollment efforts that
help provide consumers with the sup-
port and information that they need to
make the right healthcare decisions for
their families. Restoring this funding
is critical, considering that the Trump
administration gutted funding for con-
sumer outreach and marketing by 90
percent. It cut navigator funding by 80
percent, leaving huge swaths of the
country without access to fair and un-
biased enrollment help.
H.R. 987 will also provide States with
funding to establish their own State-
based marketplaces, which will help
make healthcare more affordable. In
2018, premiums in these State market-
places were 17 percent lower than in
the federally facilitated marketplace,
and enrollment was higher for the
State plans.
And, finally, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 987
will reverse the Trump administra-
tion’s regulation to expand junk insur-
ance plans, known as short-term lim-
ited duration health insurance. The
Trump administration expanded these
junk plans from the current 3-month
term and made these plans available
for up to 3 years.
These junk plans are exactly that,
Mr. Chairman: They are junk. They
discriminate against people with pre-
existing conditions. They set higher
premiums for people based on age, gen-
der, and health status. They deny ac-
cess to basic benefits like prescription
drugs, maternity care, and mental
health and substance abuse treatment,
and they set arbitrary dollar limits for
healthcare services leading to huge
surprise bills for consumers. This legis-
lation would prevent the administra-
tion’s expansion of these plans from
taking place.
In closing, Mr. Chairman, I believe
this is an important bill that will lower
healthcare and prescription drug costs,
protect people with preexisting condi-
tions, and end some of the administra-
tion’s ongoing sabotage of our Nation’s
healthcare system.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support this bill, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, The Washington Post
said it best. Allow me to quote this
headline from yesterday: ‘‘Democrats
Are Putting a Political Pothole in the
Way of Bipartisan Drug Pricing Bills.’’
It didn’t have to be this way. Ameri-
cans want us to come together, work
together, solve problems. This is a big
one. I hear about it every time I am
home, and I have done more townhalls
than anybody in this House—20 of them
so far this year.
Drug pricing is a big issue. We actu-
ally agreed. We worked it out. We
passed these bills out of committee,
unanimously. And then somewhere
along the path to the House floor, they
jammed our bipartisan efforts to lower
drug costs with clearly partisan bills.
The chairman didn’t mention those
bills came out of committee on a par-
tisan vote.
To bail out ObamaCare, Democrats
are once again putting politics and par-
tisanship over what could have been bi-
partisan public policy.
Republicans and Democrats have
been working together on bipartisan
legislation to bring generic drugs to
market faster by incentivizing more
competition and ensuring patients get
the earliest possible access to more af-
fordable prescription drugs.
We agree on that, just as we did in
the last Congress when I was chairman.
We led the effort to revamp every part
of the FDA and how they can get drugs
to market sooner.
As a result of our work there and in
our bipartisan work before that on 21st
Century Cures, we really ramped up
the ability of the FDA to get competi-
tion and new drugs into the market.
They set a record last year in getting
generics to market as a result of our
bipartisan work. We could have had
that, today, on this floor.
The first measure that we do agree
upon would ensure branded drug mak-
ers do not withhold samples that are
needed to get generic drugs approved;
the second would ban pay-for-delay
agreements; and the third would limit
first-approved generic makers’ ability
to stall another rival’s launch. So we
put a stop to what I would say are bad
behaviors in that process.
Together, these bills would help pa-
tients actually get access to more af-
fordable prescription drugs, and those
bills are bipartisan. Just how bipar-
tisan? Two of the bills passed the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee by
voice vote, and the third passed unani-
mously on a 51–0 vote.
Now, Mr. Chair, this is how the
American people expect us to get our
work done, but, sadly, House Demo-
crats once again could not pass up a
chance to play gotcha politics. So what
did they do? They packaged these
agreed-to bipartisan drug pricing pro-
posals with a bailout of ObamaCare
that passed out of committee on a
purely partisan vote.
Now here is what that bill contains:
First, $200 million a year in taxpayer
funding for States to establish
ObamaCare marketplaces. This funding
expired 5 years ago, albeit not before
hundreds of millions of Federal tax-
payer resources were wasted, including
in my own State that finally had to
give up on that and go with a national
plan.
New Jersey has recently expressed an
interest in creating a new State ex-
change, and they say they can do it
without new Federal taxpayer money;
they can do it without us. If a State de-
cides to create an exchange, then they
shall be allowed to do so, but we don’t
need to create new Federal grants for
things that States say they have the
capacity to do themselves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3855
May 16, 2019
Second, $100 million a year—$100 mil-
lion a year—to fund the navigator pro-
gram. Now, for plan year 2017, naviga-
tors received a total of $62.5 million in
grants, and they enrolled 81,426 individ-
uals. That means it cost $767 per person
that they enrolled, and that accounted
for less than 1 percent of the total en-
rollees.
Now, it is important to understand,
by contrast, agents and brokers as-
sisted 42 percent of those in the enroll-
ment year of 2018. Do you know what it
cost for them to do it? $2.40. Yet, under
this law, you can’t use the funds for
the navigators to actually pay for
those folks, the brokers and agents, to
do this work that they do very effi-
ciently. $767 per enrollee versus $2.40.
Third, the bill reverses the adminis-
tration’s efforts to allow more State-
regulated insurance plan options for
consumers who, frankly, are getting
priced out of the market and are look-
ing for choices that fit them and their
lives.
I want to set the record straight on
these plans.
The plans you heard described earlier
were actually legal under ObamaCare
and the Obama administration, and
they are legal under the Trump admin-
istration. They provide choices to peo-
ple in between jobs or people who can’t
afford these exploding premiums.
You know, the promise that your pre-
mium is going to go down 2,500 bucks
kind of evaporated as soon as the bill
became law, so people are stuck with
ever-increasing premiums, enormous
deductibles, and saying: Could we
please allow our States to put together
options for us that still have to go
through a State insurance regulator?
And they certainly care about their
systems.
CBO projected premiums for these
plans could be as much as 60 percent
lower than the cheapest Federal man-
dated plan, 60 percent, and, even more,
States can regulate these plans. In
fact, in the chairman’s home State of
New Jersey, they are simply banned.
That is New Jersey’s choice. They
should have that choice.
In my home State of Oregon, they
are limited to 90 days. That is what we
have chosen. This is kind of federalism
at its best.
But in their Washington-knows-best
mentality, the bills brought before us
today strip away this option for longer
term plans, and that is wrong and it is
unfair.
Fourth, the bill spends $100,000,000 a
year to market the Federal plans. They
couldn’t stop there. Instead of edu-
cating patients on all the plans’ op-
tions available to them, their legisla-
tion actually places a gag order on the
promotion of more affordable choices,
specifically association health plans,
known as AHPs, and the short-term
limited duration insurance plans. You
can’t even tell consumers about that.
Oh, no. We are going to have a gag
order from Washington.
So there is simply no reason to com-
bine these bills with our bipartisan, I
would say unanimously approved, bills
to deal with drugs.
Energy and Commerce Republicans
put forth an alternative bill that in-
cludes all of H.R. 987’s bipartisan drug
provisions I referenced earlier but re-
moves the partisan, the strictly gotcha
provisions.
Our pragmatic plan replaces these
partisan provisions with language ex-
tending funding for community health
centers, the National Health Service
Corps, and other public health extend-
ers for a year. Now, these public health
extenders should be a top bipartisan
priority for the Congress, as they must
be done before the end of the fiscal
year, the end of September, and they
deserve the attention of Congress.
Let me go back to the navigators for
a minute. The Wall Street Journal re-
ported: ‘‘One grantee took in $200,000 to
enroll a grand total of one person.’’
They went on to write: ‘‘The top 10
most expensive navigators collected
$2.77 million to sign up 314 people.’’
If you take that $2.77 million that
they want to give to these navigators—
they are the most expensive operators
on the planet—to sign people up for in-
surance and gave that to our commu-
nity health centers, do you know how
many people they could cover with
$2.77 million? One estimate is 20,000 pa-
tients—20,000 patients.
So Republicans are saying let’s take
that money and actually get it out to
help patients through our community
health centers rather than spend it on
navigators that can take $200,000 and
enroll one person, or $767, on average,
versus $2.40 when agents and brokers do
this enrollment.
We think we have a better way. Our
bill, H.R. 2700, is called the Lowering
Prescription Drug Costs and Extending
Community Health Centers and Other
Public Health Priorities Act. It is pret-
ty straightforward. It is an honest
title.
We should take this bill up now, Mr.
Chairman, because the majority, unfor-
tunately, has decided to put politics
before us today with our bipartisan ef-
forts to lower drug costs.
The bill before us right now is going
nowhere in the Senate. They have said
that. The White House has weighed in,
so they don’t like it either.
We should take up the alternative to
move our bipartisan work forward and
take care of our responsibilities to en-
sure our community health centers and
other public health priorities are fund-
ed. That has always been a bipartisan
effort.
Finally, just to further the point on
the blatant and unnecessary partisan-
ship on display here today, House
Democrats made 26 amendments in
order on this bill—26. One of those
amendments, just one, was authored by
a Republican.
Now, they control everything around
here, and they said in the opening days
they are going to open up this process.
Ninety-two percent of the amendments
allowed to be brought to the floor so
far this year have been from Demo-
crats. When we were in charge, 45 per-
cent—45 percent—were the minority’s
amendments that came to the floor.
So, so much for openness. Just one
was authored by a Republican. So it is
unfortunate we find ourselves here
today. It didn’t have to be this way.
b 1245
These are measures, especially on the
drug side, we are already all in agree-
ment on. If they were separated out,
you would have passage. It would go
right to the President from the Senate.
I think they would take them up and
pass them to become law. So, when the
majority is ready to make law, let us
know.
In the meantime, we have a better
way to take care of our community
health centers, our patients, and those
seeking more choices and more afford-
able rates for an insurance product
than what the Federal Government is
mandating.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), our dis-
tinguished whip.
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding me
the time.
Mr. Chairman, today, I stand for the
American people and the voters of
South Carolina’s Sixth Congressional
District who spoke loud and clear last
November, demanding that Congress
defend and uphold the right to have ac-
cess to affordable care.
This is an effort to dismantle the Af-
fordable Care Act, and we stand ready
to defend every aspect of this legisla-
tion.
We will not stop our efforts to hold
this administration and my Republican
colleagues accountable as they con-
tinue misrepresenting and undermining
the Affordable Care Act.
The work of this body, a coequal
branch of our government, to conduct
legitimate and lawful oversight in
order to protect Americans’ access to
healthcare will not be deterred.
Today, this House will vote on a
package of seven bills that will halt
the administration’s sabotage of the
Affordable Care Act, improve the act’s
implementation, and lower the cost of
prescription drugs.
This legislative package, titled the
Strengthening Health Care and Low-
ering Prescription Drug Costs Act, pre-
vents the substitution of junk policies
that take advantage of unsuspecting
citizens, and it protects against dis-
crimination for preexisting conditions.

lifesaving medications and other neces-
sities, like rent or food.
Mr. Chairman, Democrats are ad-
dressing crucial healthcare needs. We
stand to protect the healthcare of
American citizens.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. GUTHRIE), a very accom-
plished member of our committee.
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today in opposition to H.R. 987, the
supposed Strengthening Health Care
and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs
Act.
I wish I wasn’t giving this speech. As
many of my colleagues know, I have a
bipartisan track record here in the
House. I have been proud to work with
many of my Democrat colleagues on a
number of issues that impact Kentuck-
ians and people across the country,
such as Alzheimer’s, the opioid crisis,
and workforce development.
Last Congress, I had 10 bipartisan
bills signed into law, and I had two ad-
ditional bipartisan bills pass the
House. I hope my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle know that I take bi-
partisanship and our responsibility to
get things done for our constituents
very seriously. That is why I am ex-
tremely disappointed that I will have
to vote against H.R. 987 today.
Wherever I go in my district, I hear
from Kentuckians about how drug
prices are simply too high. This an
issue that affects everyone, and it is
one of the few big issues these days
that Republicans and Democrats can
all agree on. And President Trump has
made this a priority.
As ranking member of the Oversight
and Investigations Subcommittee, I
have launched, with Chair DIANA
DEGETTE from Colorado, an investiga-
tion on rising insulin prices.
I was proud to support bipartisan leg-
islation in the Health Subcommittee
and the full Energy and Commerce
Committee. Sadly, Mr. Chairman,
Democrats have loaded up what was
previously a bipartisan drug pricing
legislative bill with political land
mines that they know we, as Repub-
licans, will never support.
They made a bipartisan drug pricing
bill into an ObamaCare bailout bill.
They know that this bill is dead on ar-
rival in the Senate and that President
Trump will never sign it.
My colleagues are playing games to
score cheap political points in the
short term at the expense of Americans
across the country who are paying too
much at the pharmacy counter.
I urge my colleagues on the Demo-
cratic side not to make lowering drug
prices another partisan fight. I am
willing to work with any of my col-
leagues to fix this problem, and I urge
all my colleagues to do the same.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RUSH), the sponsor of the pay-
for-delay legislation.
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the full committee chairman for giving
me this time.
Mr. Chairman, I am proud, on behalf
of the people of the First District of Il-
linois, to rise today in support of H.R.
987, which includes my legislation, the
Protecting Consumer Access to Generic
Drugs Act.
My legislation included in today’s
package prohibits the practice of pay-
for-delay where brand-name companies
compensate generics to prevent the
entry of cheaper drugs into the mar-
ket.
I have long stood against these anti-
competitive deals that limit competi-
tion and force consumers to pay more
for their medications.
This disgraceful and deceptive prac-
tice ends now. I stand with my col-
leagues to stop drug companies from
continuing to rig the system in an at-
tempt to take advantage of hard-
working Americans.
My legislation will take a meaning-
ful step toward bringing this behavior
to a screeching halt and holding drug
companies accountable once and for
all.
With today’s package of prescription
drug bills, we are making progress to-
ward addressing the skyrocketing cost
of prescription drugs and are making
good on our promise that no American
should be forced to make the choice be-
tween paying their bills and buying
their pills.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. BURGESS), our top Republican on
the Health Subcommittee, a former
chairman of the subcommittee, and a
distinguished member of the Rules
Committee.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I do rise today to speak in opposition
to H.R. 987.
Mr. Chairman, I am concerned that
the Democrats are using bipartisan
drug pricing bills to pay for partisan
politics.
Look, these bills are proof that we
can work together across the aisle and
do what is best for constituents. Unfor-
tunately, as The Washington Post so
eloquently said yesterday in ‘‘The
Health 202,’’ ‘‘Democrats are putting a
political pothole in the way of bipar-
tisan drug pricing bills.’’
The Democrats have decided to use $5
billion in savings to fund State-based
ACA marketplaces, the federally facili-
tated marketplace navigator program.
This morning, a publication called
STAT published an article titled, ‘‘In
Washington, a partisan approach to
lowering drug costs leaves Democrats
doubting their own party leadership.’’
As this article reported, even House
Democrats do not understand why the
Speaker of the House and party leader-
ship have decided to politicize bipar-
tisan bills that enjoy widespread sup-
port.
The chairwoman of the Energy and
Commerce Health Subcommittee is on
record as saying she was ‘‘not a fan of
what happened.’’
Republicans stand ready to work on
solutions. Congressman MARK MEAD-
OWS, the chairman of the Freedom Cau-
cus, told STAT that the Democrats’ po-
litical stunt is a wasted political op-
portunity.
He continued, ‘‘You have got the
chairman of the Freedom Caucus will-
ing to work with Democrats on making
real, structural reforms on prescription
drug prices. And what do they do? They
put a poison pill in, trying to augment
a failing healthcare-delivery system.’’
I ask my friends on the other side of
the dais, why are you intent on
tanking good legislation that can de-
liver real results for real people? You
say you want to lower drug prices, but
your actions speak loudly otherwise.
Fortunately, I am not just here to
complain. I also have a solution to the
scenario we are facing on the floor
today.
On Tuesday night at the Rules Com-
mittee, I offered an amendment that
would take these three drug policies
and the $5 billion in savings from those
policies, and I introduced H.R. 2700, the
Lowering Prescription Drug Costs and
Extending Community Health Centers
and Other Public Health Priorities Act.
H.R. 2700 couples the bipartisan drug
pricing policies with reauthorization
programs, such as Community Health
Centers and Special Diabetes Pro-
grams.
Look, reauthorizations are tough. I
know. I was chairman of the Health
Subcommittee in the last Congress.
September seems like a long way away.
Many of these programs expire at the
end of the fiscal year, but the time to
get these things done is now.
We have taken no specific action to-
ward reauthorization of these pro-
grams. Again, September seems far
away, but we have to account for the
time it takes to move through regular
order.
On the other issues that we are fac-
ing today, the short-term, limited du-
ration rule repeal, according to the
Congressional Budget Office and the
Joint Committee on Taxation, the pol-
icy to repeal the Trump administra-
tion’s short-term, limited duration in-
surance rule would result in 500,000 in-
dividuals becoming uninsured.
Is this what you want? Isn’t it better
that people have some form of insur-
ance than none at all?
I take meetings in my office back
home in my district with families that
cannot afford the high premium, high
deductible plans that they have been
forced to buy off the ACA exchange.
These individuals need lower cost op-
tions, and that is exactly what these
limited duration plans provide.
States already regulate these plans
and have the authority to disallow
them at the State level, if they so
choose. This is a case for federalism.
I want to quote from the Congres-
sional Budget Office report: ‘‘CBO and
JCT estimate that enacting the legisla-
tion would result in roughly 1.5 million
fewer people’’ participating in insur-
ance plans.

May 16, 2019
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
the gentleman from Texas an addi-
tional 30 seconds.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman.
Of those, more than 500,000 would in-
stead participate in nongroup coverage
through the marketplaces established
by the Affordable Care Act, and 500,000
would become uninsured.
The drug policies contained in both
H.R. 987 and my bill, H.R. 2700, are
commonsense bipartisan measures to
lower drug prices for our constituents.
I am disappointed they have been
rolled into a partisan package that will
be dead on arrival in the Senate.
We were able to work together in the
committee and subcommittee to en-
sure these policies would improve ac-
cess to generics for American patients.
I hope the Democratic leadership would
consider the bipartisan nature of the
policies when moving the packages to
the floor in the future.
The CHAIR. Members are reminded
to address their remarks to the Chair.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 to the gentlewoman from Illinois
(Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), who chairs our Con-
sumer Protection and Commerce Sub-
committee.
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman,
the real political grandstanding that
we are hearing today is from the Re-
publican side of the aisle, which for
nearly 10 years has been fighting
against the Affordable Care Act.
Over 60 times, they voted against the
Affordable Care Act. Maybe it is be-
cause some people call it ObamaCare.
We know that millions and millions of
people have gotten healthcare because
of it.
It is time to stop and to say let’s
work together to make the Affordable
Care Act even better and extend access.
The fact is that the Affordable Care
Act and affordable prescription drugs
are two pillars of healthcare access.
They really cannot be separated.
I am proud that we have an oppor-
tunity today to do what was impossible
while the Republicans were in charge
of the Congress. Today, we are voting
on making impactful, lasting change in
lowering the cost of healthcare, includ-
ing prescription drugs, for Americans
nationwide.
Democrats are at the table and ready
to pass this legislation.
b 1300
We are ready to improve all aspects
of healthcare from healthcare afford-
ability, to prescription drug afford-
ability. Instead of offering amend-
ments in bad faith, we need to pass this
bill.
Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues
to reject the amendment by Mr.
BUCSHON and support the passage of
H.R. 987 in its entirety.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, before I recognize our
pharmacist, Mr. CARTER from Georgia,
I just want to say I have been on the
floor a lot in the last few weeks on this
issue, and we keep getting the same re-
frain about Republicans voting 60
times to repeal ObamaCare.
What is never said is that 30 of those
bills, my friends on the other side of
the aisle voted for, and President
Obama signed them into law—I’m
sorry. Twenty-one of those bills were
signed into law by President Obama.
So it is 21 of the 30 were signed into
law by President Obama.
So my point being is, ObamaCare had
problems. We came together and tried
to address those problems with this
legislation, repealing the
unsustainable CLASS Act, the co-ops,
the Cadillac and medical device taxes
we voted to delay, the Independent
Payment Advisory Board, and on and
on. My friends on the other side of the
aisle voted with us and we with them
to fix those sorts of things. So don’t
come down here and tell me it is only
Republicans who voted to do things on
ObamaCare.
We also support these drug bills.
There is no question about that, be-
cause we want to get lower-cost drugs
and stop bad behaviors that prevent
generics from coming to market soon-
er.
Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER),
a pharmacist.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I come before you today a
very disappointed person; a dis-
appointed Member of Congress; a dis-
appointed pharmacist. I am dis-
appointed that my Democratic col-
leagues have decided to prioritize poli-
tics over patients by packaging to-
gether bipartisan bills to lower drug
costs with partisan bills to bail out
ObamaCare. They are two completely
different subjects.
Republicans and Democrats have
worked hard to create strong, bipar-
tisan bills that will increase the
amount of generic drugs entering the
marketplace, bringing more affordable
choices to patients. Now, House Demo-
crats have chosen to use these bipar-
tisan bills to pay for partisan
ObamaCare bills.
This bill includes major drug pricing
proposals like the CREATES Act, and
the pay for delay, which both seek to
increase the ability of lower-cost ge-
neric drugs getting to the market
quickly, providing patients with more
affordable choices.
We had long, hard-fought negotia-
tions with our Democratic counter-
parts in multiple markups that ran
until midnight over these two pro-
posals, but we were eventually able to
come to an agreement.
The other drug-pricing bill in this
package is a bill that I have worked on
with my friend, Representative SCHRA-
DER from Oregon, the BLOCKING Act.
This bill mirrors the proposal from
President Trump’s budget proposal to
keep bad actors from clogging up our
generic drug pipeline.
Hear me, Mr. Chair, and hear me
clearly. This bill is the picture-perfect
definition of good bipartisan legisla-
tion. Democrats are throwing that
work away by prioritizing politics over
patients. All three of these bipartisan
drug-pricing bills save money, so the
Democrats are choosing to use their
hard-fought savings and wish lists for
partisan politics.
The bill before us today will throw
hundreds of millions of dollars at the
failed ObamaCare marketplace and fur-
ther restrict patient choice. The bot-
tom line is, there is no need for this
course. Drug pricing should not be a
partisan issue.
In all of my years of being a phar-
macist, I have seen patients struggle
with the high cost of prescription
drugs. Now that I am in Congress, I
hear about it all the time from my con-
stituents back home. We all do.
Voters across the country sent us up
here to work together on issues, like
drug pricing. The three drug-pricing
bills in this package show that we can,
in fact, do that. We can work together
on important issues.
When we work together, we can
achieve real results that help patients.
But once again, we are letting politics
become the priority instead of helping
people. Republicans want to work to-
gether on drug pricing. The people
want us to work together on drug pric-
ing.
I call on my colleagues to do the
right thing. Let’s put patients before
politics.
Mr. Chair, this is important. Strike
these partisan poison pills in this bill
and send our excellent drug-pricing
work over to the Senate and on to the
President’s desk and have him sign
them into law.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), our distinguished
majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, if you put pa-
tients before politics, you will vote for
this bill because patients care about
prescription drugs, but they also care
about access to affordable, quality
healthcare.
Now, you sent a bill to the Presi-
dent—or you didn’t really send it to
him because it didn’t pass the Senate—
and you went down to the White House
and you exalted about the bill you had
passed, and the President said: This is
a good bill. Then he had the oppor-
tunity to, perhaps, have his advisers
tell him what was in the bill, and 10
days later he said: This is a mean bill
because it shortchanged patients for
politics.
Mr. Chair, last week the House
passed H.R. 986, a bill to protect cov-
erage for those with preexisting condi-
tions, and the Republicans said: No, it
doesn’t do that. They wanted to change
the name of the bill. Not only did they
want to vote against it, they wanted to
change the name of the bill. Why? Be-
cause they want to tell the public we

are for protecting you against pre-
existing conditions. We just don’t vote
that way.
This week House Democrats are con-
tinuing to strengthen access to afford-
able healthcare by passing H.R. 987, an
additional package of bills aimed at
strengthening our healthcare system
and lowering prescription drug costs
because patients don’t just worry
about prescription drugs, they worry
about their health coverage. As a mat-
ter of fact, it is hard to separate the
two.
This effort is critical because the
Trump administration, in its campaign
and from its very first day, and con-
gressional Republicans, have been
working tirelessly to sabotage
healthcare access and undermine the
reforms of the Affordable Care Act.
They voted against it and, yes, they
voted over, and over, and over again to
repeal it.
With all due respect to my friend, we
didn’t vote for those bills.
Now, we may have voted for some
bills to improve the Affordable Care
Act, but we certainly didn’t vote for
any of your bills which had the effect
of repealing ObamaCare, because we
believe it is in the best interest of the
American public, and so does the ma-
jority of the American public.
Last year, 1.1 million Americans lost
health coverage after years of gains in
coverage. This shows us, dangerously,
that the Trump administration’s ad-
ministrative sabotage is having its in-
tended adverse effect, from limiting ac-
cess to open enrollment, to allowing
junk plans.
Let me say something about junk
plans because the gentleman says:
Well, some people can’t afford it. Yes,
they get a plan and they think they
have health coverage, and by the way,
it doesn’t cover something when they
get really ill, or they have lifetime
limits, or annual limits. They don’t
have this covered. They don’t have the
other covered.
Not only that, but guess what hap-
pens to the insurance pool? It becomes
riskier. And guess what happens then?
The price goes up. You don’t have to be
a genius or know much about the in-
surance business to know that that is
the case.
From repealing votes in Congress, to
anti-ACA lawsuits in the courts, Re-
publicans have been trying to under-
mine the Affordable Care Act.
From shortening enrollment periods,
to cutting funding for outreach to let
people know what is available to them
and what is the best policy for them.
Advice and counsel, they don’t have to
take any of it, but they ought to have
that available to them.
This sabotage is hurting access to af-
fordable, quality healthcare coverage
for the people. That is what we are
here for. For the people. And that is
what this legislation is for. For the
people.
The legislation before the House
today would push back on these efforts
that sabotage in several ways: first, we
are banning junk plans that don’t pro-
vide adequate coverage and raise pre-
miums for comprehensive health plans.
Next, we are taking action to bring
generic drugs to market more quickly,
helping to lower the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs. I appreciate the fact that
my Republican colleagues support
those bills. I appreciate the gentleman
who knows full well as a pharmacist
the crisis that confronts people when
they can’t afford lifesaving and health-
enhancing prescription drugs.
But they also are facing real prob-
lems on the availability of health in-
surance should they have to have
health providers, whether they are doc-
tors, or hospitals.
Finally, H.R. 987 increases funding
for outreach, enrollment, and naviga-
tors to help Americans find the right
healthcare plan. That is for the people,
to help the people understand, and to
have access, and to be secure in know-
ing they have adequate healthcare for
them and their families.
It also provides States with addi-
tional funding to establish State-based
marketplaces. Innovation. Our legisla-
tion will provide insurers, providers,
and patients alike with greater cer-
tainty that the Affordable Care Act
will continue to make healthcare
available and affordable to Americans
with preexisting conditions.
I am pleased that my Republican col-
leagues are supporting the prescription
drug titles of this bill. Perhaps we will
send it over to the Senate, and maybe
that is all they will send back.
But the fact of the matter is, we have
a broader responsibility than just pre-
scription drugs. Democrats are com-
mitted to bringing healthcare costs
down and making sure more Americans
can access quality, affordable coverage.
Mr. Chair, I want to thank Rep-
resentatives CICILLINE, RUSH, SCHRA-
DER, CASTOR, KIM, and BLUNT ROCH-
ESTER for their leadership in the com-
ponent parts of this bill, which will
make the security for healthcare bet-
ter for the people. They have intro-
duced the constituent parts of this bill.
Of course, I want to thank my good
friend, FRANK PALLONE. Nobody has
worked harder for a longer period of
time to enhance the healthcare of
Americans. Nobody has worked harder
in committee, both initially on the Af-
fordable Care Act, of which he was a
very significant part of the authorship,
and since then in protecting it and try-
ing to enhance it. This bill is impor-
tant for us to pass to do just that.
That is why I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to join us in
standing up for the Affordable Care Act
and its benefits; not undermining the
law and its reforms. Having agreement
on prescription reforms, bringing
prices down, and making generics more
available is an important step. But it is
not the only step that we need to take.
This is not the final step. This is a
step. It is an important step.
I hope that Republicans and Demo-
crats would support this bill over-
whelmingly because, as I said, it is for
the people.
The CHAIR. Members are reminded
to address their remarks to the Chair.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
I want to make a couple of points be-
fore I introduce the author of the CRE-
ATES Act. The gentleman that just
spoke, Mr. HOYER, voted 21 times, on 21
of the bills that were signed into law to
repeal parts of ObamaCare. The gen-
tleman voted for it because those parts
were unworkable. So when you hear
about 60 times, remember the leader,
the distinguished leader, my friend, ac-
tually voted for 21 of those, as did I.
When we talk about the people, let
me read you a little statement from
Tom from Medford who wrote me in
October of last year. He said, ‘‘Greg, I
just received a letter from the insur-
ance company stating their monthly
premium next year will go up nearly 40
percent, from $632 to $883 per month,
and that is with the plan more or less
staying the same, but without any out-
of-network healthcare.’’
b 1315
That is not affordable. That is why
we think States should have options.
When it comes to the navigators that
they want to dump all this money into,
remember agents and brokers in the
private sector cost about $2.40 for them
to sign somebody up. The navigators
would cost, based on 2017 numbers, $767
per enrollee. And for the $2.7 million
that was spent to sign up 314 people, if
you put that money—as Republicans
want to do—into community health
centers, one estimate is you could
cover 20,000 people with that $2.77 mil-
lion.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
SENSENBRENNER). My friend is the
former chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee and the former chairman of the
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee, and a leader on this CREATES
effort legislation on bringing drug
prices down.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to H.R. 987,
the ObamaCare bailout act.
One of the things that has frustrated
me in the almost 5 months that the
Democrats have controlled this Cham-
ber is that anything that is good, bi-
partisan, and for the people they turn
into a partisan screaming contest.
That is exactly what they have done
with the CREATES Act, which will
bring down prescription drug prices
and has strong bipartisan support in
both Houses and, as a standalone bill,
would have a very good chance of being
signed into law.
So we can talk today about all of
these things about ObamaCare that the
other side of the aisle wants to put
more money into, but that is going no-
where. I think what we should do is
look at what we can accomplish, and
we can accomplish changing the way
that drugs are priced through the CRE-
ATES Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3859
May 16, 2019
At a time when everything is a dra-
matic political battle, lowering pre-
scription drug prices is one of the few
opportunities where it seemed like Re-
publicans and Democrats could get
something meaningful done for the
American people.
Just a few weeks ago, the Judiciary
and Energy and Commerce Committees
worked across the aisle unanimously
reporting out several bills to that end.
My friend, the gentleman from Rhode
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), and I are spon-
sors of one of those bills, the CREATES
Act. Our commonsense legislation
would allow consumers to access
cheaper generic drugs sooner, driving
down costs and saving taxpayers
money.
According to CBO estimates, our bill
would save the American taxpayer $3.9
billion over 10 years. This bill has the
kind of bipartisan support to become
law. However, instead of letting this
body vote on our commonsense bill in
standalone form, the Democratic lead-
ership has tacked it on to this
ObamaCare bill.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. The
ObamaCare bailout package has no
chance of passing in the Senate. The
majority leader just admitted that.
This is a missed opportunity, and it is
highly disappointing.
The American people want us to
work in a bipartisan manner. The
American people want us to accomplish
things, and this is a poison pill that
will make sure that this bill never sees
the light of day in the Senate and will
never become law.
When they take up this bill, I hope
they strip out all the ObamaCare bail-
out—free of poison pills—and pass the
bipartisan drug pricing bills so the
House will be able to reconsider them
in a more bipartisan fashion.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume to
reinforce what the gentleman from
Wisconsin said.
This is from The Washington Post:
‘‘The Health 202: Democrats Are Put-
ting a Political Pothole in the Way of
Bipartisan Drug Pricing Bills.’’
That is all you need to know. It
didn’t have to be this way. These bills
came out of the committee individ-
ually. The Democratic leadership put
them together knowing full well they
could put a poison pill into a drug re-
form bill and delay consumers’ ability
to get more affordable drugs sooner,
because this legislation could move
through the Senate and down to the
President much more quickly if it
didn’t have these provisions.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. MATSUI).
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today as a proud cosponsor of H.R. 987,
legislation that advances Democrats’
commitment to rein in the soaring
costs of healthcare for consumers.
I am pleased that we are taking im-
portant steps forward to address an
issue I hear from constituents almost
daily: the rising cost of prescription
medicines. Just recently, I heard from
Mary, who is living with a lifelong
chronic condition. The cost of her
medication has skyrocketed in recent
years to the point that it has forced
her to cancel prescriptions and forgo
treatment. This is really unacceptable.
The bills before us today represent an
opportunity to make progress by allow-
ing lower cost generic drugs to come to
market sooner. Furthermore, these ef-
forts aim to make healthcare more af-
fordable for patients with preexisting
conditions by reversing the Trump ad-
ministration’s relentless and ongoing
sabotage of the ACA.
This is critical for people like Charis,
a constituent in my district who fears
that, without the ACA, she would have
to hide her rare disease in order to get
adequate medical care. No patient
should have to live with such a worry.
I am pleased to be able to support
these patient protections on the floor
today, and I remain committed to
keeping the pressure on tackling pre-
scription drug and insurance costs and
working to defend Americans’ rights to
quality and affordable healthcare.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Vermont (Mr. WELCH).
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, this leg-
islation is going to help make
healthcare more affordable and more
accessible.
There are two things:
One, we finally are attacking the ex-
plosion in the cost of prescription
drugs, and I thank my Republican col-
leagues for participating in that effort.
In Vermont, we just had a 16 percent
rate increase for requests from Blue
Cross Blue Shield, and 9 percent of that
is attributable to the increase in
pharma costs. This is happening be-
cause pharma has been ripping us off
for far too long.
This bill does two things: One, it ends
their abusive, outrageous practice of
paying generic companies to delay
bringing their lower cost drug to the
market. There is no excuse for that.
This bill ends it. The second thing it
does is deny pharma the opportunity to
withhold samples so that generic com-
panies can come up with a competitive
product. That is tremendous, it is over-
due, and it is just the beginning.
Second, this makes healthcare more
accessible by funding navigators. My
colleagues disregard that, but, in fact,
navigators help people make the com-
plicated decision about what is the best
healthcare plan for them.
It also provides money for outreach.
We want folks to know what is avail-
able for them, make the best choice,
and have the security of healthcare.
Finally, there will be protection for
the auto enrollment program. Every-
body is busy. If the default position is
you are back in the plan you had, that
is good. There is security in that. Peo-
ple can make options to get out or to
change their plan. We want them to
shop. This makes healthcare affordable
and more accessible.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume to
thank the gentleman from Vermont for
not only his comments here on the
floor, but his comments publicly about
what we agree with, which is these
issues should have remained separate
and not lumped together.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. CASTOR).
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-
man, Democrats are doing everything
that we can to lower the cost of
healthcare and prescription drugs, so I
strongly support the act that is on the
floor today. It contains two bills that I
authored.
First is H.R. 1010, which prohibits the
expansion of these junk insurance
plans. Junk insurance plans are the
ones that do not cover preexisting con-
ditions. You can often be tricked into
buying one of these plans and find out
it doesn’t even cover the trip to the
hospital.
In fact, I asked Secretary Azar, in
committee, about this. I asked him:
You are aware that these junk plans do
not cover preexisting conditions?
He said: That is correct.
The bill also contains another sec-
tion that I authored, the ENROLL Act,
to restore funds to our independent
navigators who are helping American
families choose the right health insur-
ance options for them. Agents and bro-
kers are important, but they are no
substitute for independent navigators
who are trusted in the community.
We have got to pass these bills today
to lower healthcare costs for families
all across the country and lower pre-
scription drug costs. I am very proud
to have authored two portions of this.
Let’s not let them expand these junk
plans and leave you on the hook. Let’s
make sure that families have the inde-
pendent advice that they need to
choose what makes the most sense for
them.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I will
say that the State of Florida actually
allows State-regulated plans to go up
to 364 days to give Floridians an oppor-
tunity to have choice. When it comes
to association health plans that allow
small businesses like I used to own to
get together and offer more affordable
health insurance, they put a gag order
on so that you can’t tell America’s pa-
tients they might have that option.
So, Mr. Chairman, I don’t know that
I would fully trust all these navigators.
According to The Wall Street Journal,
one grantee took in $200,000 of your tax
dollars and enrolled one person. The

top 10 most expensive navigators col-
lected $2.77 million to sign up 314 peo-
ple. If you put that $2.77 million into
our community health centers, as the
Republicans would prefer, to spend
that money, then you would cover
20,000 patients, according to one esti-
mate.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. SCHRADER), who is the spon-
sor of the BLOCKING Act, one of the
generic competition bills.
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I
rise today in favor of the package of
bills before us that includes efforts to
stabilize the marketplace and address
drug prices, a win-win for America. I
am particularly proud to rise in sup-
port of one bill in the package, my bill,
cosponsored with my good friend from
Georgia, Buddy Carter, H.R. 938, the
BLOCKING Act.
As we are all too well aware, the ris-
ing cost of drug prices is deeply im-
pacting every American. At the same
time, addressing this issue does not
have one big silver bullet solution. The
BLOCKING Act is one of many that
will address this larger problem. It
takes action to ensure that generic
drugs reach the market as quickly as
possible.
Generic drugs save patients tens of
billions of dollars every year. The more
competition we have in the generic
space, the more savings we see. It is
with that knowledge that we provide
generic manufacturers that incentive
of 180 days of exclusivity.
Unfortunately, in the current sys-
tem, some generic manufacturers delay
bringing their drugs to market by
parking their applications, once being
awarded the exclusivity, and not actu-
ally bringing their drug to market.
Doing so does not allow others to come
to the market and extends their hold,
to the disadvantage of the American
consumer.
That being said, a solution is quite
simple. We need to prevent loopholes
that decrease competition and inad-
vertently keep drug prices high.
I remain committed to working to
lower drug prices and urge others to
support passage of this package of bills
that will assist in addressing this crit-
ical issue for America.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, my
friend from Oregon is right on the drug
pieces, and like other Democrats I
know, there are a lot of people who
think that we should keep these bills
separately and they would zoom on
through here, but not package them up
the way they are.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Washington
State (Mrs. RODGERS).
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Chairman, I thank our Republican lead
on the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee for yielding. I appreciate the
gentleman’s leadership on this impor-
tant issue.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice
my support for true bipartisan efforts
to reduce prescription drug costs. Sen-
iors, patients, and families in my dis-
trict and all across America are count-
ing on us so that they can afford their
medication and have the certainty that
they need.
On the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, we have led. Republicans and
Democrats on our committee have been
working together on provisions to
bring generic drugs to the market fast-
er by incentivizing more competition
among generic manufacturers.
We recently passed three drug-pric-
ing bills with overwhelming, bipartisan
support. These are three solutions that
President Trump stands ready to sign,
and we should send them to his desk.
This is an opportunity to build on the
bipartisan work from the last Congress
to lower drug costs and keep our prom-
ises to the American people. Remem-
ber, just last fall, President Trump
signed our bipartisan bill to ban the
gag clauses so patients can save on pre-
scriptions and trust they are getting
the best price.
Again, we should build on that work.
That is what the people elected us to
do; that is what they expect; and that
is what they deserve.
b 1330
So, what has changed, and where are
we today?
The new majority—at the expense of
patients, seniors, and families—is play-
ing politics with lowering the costs of
prescription drugs.
H.R. 987 includes our bipartisan bills,
but my colleagues across the aisle have
packaged them with very partisan bills
to bail out ObamaCare.
These partisan proposals would re-
strict access to healthcare coverage
and stop the administration’s work to
reduce wasteful spending on programs
that aren’t working.
The Washington Post called these
poison bills a political pothole. We
don’t need any more political potholes.
We need real reforms that the Presi-
dent will sign. This is a ploy, and it is
just the latest.
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has historically been the most
bipartisan committee in the House,
putting more bipartisan legislation on
the President’s desk than any other.
I am disappointed that we have found
ourselves here.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER), who is
the sponsor of our Protecting Ameri-
cans With Preexisting Conditions Act
that we passed last week.
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Chair, I thank Chairman PALLONE for
yielding and for his guidance and lead-
ership on the Energy and Commerce
Committee as we advance critical leg-
islation this week to stabilize the Af-
fordable Care Act and drive down pre-
scription drug costs for all Americans.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of
H.R. 987, the Strengthening Health
Care and Lowering Prescription Drug
Costs Act. I rise hand in hand with
Granite Staters and all Americans who
have been denied care or have been
charged more for care because of pre-
existing conditions.
Asthma, allergies, Alzheimer’s, can-
cer, diabetes—you can go right through
the alphabet—having a child, these are
preexisting conditions. And I believe
people should not suffer more when
they are at their most vulnerable. Pa-
tients should not be discriminated
against or treated unfairly when they
need help the most.
I am committed to reversing the
Trump administration’s continuous,
unrelenting sabotage of the Affordable
Care Act that allows and encourages
junk health plans.
H.R. 987 invests in access to quality
care while lowering prescription drug
prices. It ensures that generics can
come to market as soon as possible so
that seniors are not skipping the medi-
cation they need because they cannot
afford it.
I support this legislation because it
puts patients first. I thank Representa-
tive LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER for her
leadership on this bill, and I encourage
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R.
987.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, at this
point I would reserve the balance of my
time to close.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. PELOSI), our dynamic
leader, our Speaker.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chair, congratula-
tions. What a joy to see the gentleman
in the chair. I thank Chairman PAL-
LONE for his extraordinary leadership
as chair of the Energy and Commerce
Committee and Congresswoman ANNA
ESHOO, chair of the Health Sub-
committee. I thank them so much for
all their hard work to bring us to this
series of bills today, in addition to the
bills of last week.
I commend our colleague who just
spoke, ANN KUSTER, for her important
legislation to preserve the benefit of
preexisting conditions not being a bar-
rier to access to care and insurance,
and also to LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER for
her leadership on the legislation before
us today to lower the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs.
Mr. Chairman and colleagues, on
Sunday we marked Mother’s Day, a
special tribute to our mothers and also
a somber reminder of the days when
being a mother—when being a woman—
was a preexisting medical condition. As
a mother of five, I can speak from some
experience as to what an obstacle that
could be to access to insurance.
Last week, we took action to block
the administration’s cynical efforts to
drag our country back to the dark days
of discrimination in healthcare cov-
erage by passing the Protecting Ameri-
cans With Preexisting Conditions Act.
Again, I salute Congresswoman
KUSTER for her leadership on this, and
also our chairman.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3861
May 16, 2019
This is not a fight about legislation
that we are gathered about here today.
This is about a fight for our lives, the
lives of many people affected.
I want to take the opportunity to sa-
lute a hero, a hero who testified last
week on healthcare at the Rules Com-
mittee, Mr. Ady Barkan.
Ady Barkan is a hero to us. He is a
man who suffers from ALS, but, in
speaking out for better healthcare,
with courage, he testified before the
committee 2 weeks ago.
Ady said: I was healthy a year ago. I
was running on the beach. I am 33
years old. I have an 18-month-old son,
Carl. And, out of nowhere, I was diag-
nosed with ALS, which, as you know,
has a life expectancy of 3 to 4 years. No
treatment, no cure.
Like so many others, Rachael—that
is his wife—and I have had to fight
with our insurers, which has issued
outrageous denials instead of covering
the benefits we paid for.
We have so little time left together,
yet our system forces us to waste it
dealing with bills and bureaucracy.
That is why I am here today urging
you to build a more rational, fair, effi-
cient, and effective system.
That was Ady testifying 2 weeks ago.
Since then, Ady lost his grand-
mother, Dina Abramov, and our sym-
pathy goes out to him. Our congratula-
tions to her for having such a magnifi-
cent and courageous grandson.
But Ady has been here so many times
with our Little Lobbyists who have
preexisting conditions, with many of
the communities that represent people
with diagnoses that need prescription
drugs and cannot afford them.
So, in the coming weeks and months,
Democrats will continue our action to
strengthen health protections for peo-
ple like Ady, the Little Lobbyists, and
others, because this is life or death. It
certainly is quality of life.
And now, our Democratic House,
today, is proud to pass the Strength-
ening Healthcare and Lowering Pre-
scription Drug Costs Act, with Con-
gresswoman BLUNT ROCHESTER.
With this legislation, we are further
reducing the price of prescription drugs
by promoting competition with
generics and reversing the Republican
sabotage that we have seen.
Mr. Chair, when we passed the Af-
fordable Care Act, it was absolutely
necessary that we do so. Even if every-
one in our country approved and loved
their insurer and was happy with their
healthcare—which was not the case,
but even if they did—it was essential
that we pass the Affordable Care Act
because we could not sustain the costs
of healthcare in our country at the
time: the cost to an individual; to a
family; to a small business; to cor-
porate America, who was paying a big
part of the bill; and to the public sec-
tor, was a tremendous burden.
With the Affordable Care Act, we
were able to lower the rate of increase
of healthcare costs in our country.
But one sector, one segment of the
healthcare arena that we did not con-
quer was the cost of prescription drugs,
which continues to contribute to the
increase of healthcare costs in our
country.
That is the main reason healthcare
costs rise: the cost of prescription
drugs.
So, I salute the chairman and the
committee and ANNA ESHOO, chair of
the subcommittee, and our distin-
guished chairman of the full com-
mittee for his legislation today which
helps to lower the cost of prescription
drugs to people, to individuals, to fami-
lies, to everyone who has a part in
funding the good health of the Amer-
ican people.
This is really essential. And it is a
fight. And it is a fight, but we are tak-
ing it one piece at a time.
The reason it had to be combined
with other bills is so that it could be
paid for. Our Republicans salute the
first part of the bill where we encour-
age competition among generics and
this, that, and the other, but want to
walk away from the part of the bill
that is essential for paying for the leg-
islation.
So, we want to be very, very respon-
sible in all of this.
One of our colleagues on the floor
earlier said that this bill was going to
go die in hell or someplace. I don’t
know where. Actually, the distin-
guished—well, not so in this case, but
the Republican leader of the Senate
has said that he is the grim reaper and
all these bills will die, designating the
Senate a graveyard for legislation that
would help the good health of the
American people, lower costs for them,
improve their lives. But he talked
about everything that we passed here.
I have some news for the distin-
guished leader in the Senate, the Re-
publican leader, Mr. MCCONNELL. The
support for this legislation, these bills,
is alive and well among the American
people, and he will be hearing from
them, because this legislation, these
bills, are a matter of life and death
and, certainly, quality of life for Amer-
ica’s working families.
So we will never limit the aspirations
and meeting the needs of the American
people to what might be legislatively
acceptable in the mind of a person in
the United States Senate, but we will
recognize our responsibility to not only
pass the boldest common denominator,
but to do so in a way that honors what
President Lincoln told us: Public senti-
ment is everything. With public senti-
ment, you can pass almost anything;
without it, practically nothing.
But, in order for the public sentiment
to weigh in, the public has to know.
And passing legislation of this kind is
a strong message. And our advocates,
whether it is the Little Lobbyists;
whether it is those who are affected by
so many aspects that the Republican
leadership is out to sabotage, that the
Trump administration is out to sabo-
tage, whether in the Congress or in the
courts—well, we will take it to the
court, as we are in the Supreme Court.
We will fight them in the Supreme
Court, but we will also fight them in
the court of public opinion. This is
very, very important to, not only the
health, but also the financial well-
being of America’s working families.
So, I salute the chairman for this leg-
islation, and I urge everyone to vote
for it. And I know that there is bipar-
tisan support for some parts of the bill.
I hope that will apply to all of it so
that it really can work.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, may I
inquire as to how much time remains
on each side, please.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Or-
egon has 2 minutes remaining. The
gentleman from New Jersey has 111⁄2
minutes remaining.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. BARRAGÁN).
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Mr. Chair, I rise
today on behalf of the millions of
Americans who are struggling to afford
their lifesaving medications. Every
day, millions face the tough decision of
having to pay for their prescriptions or
other basic costs of living like gro-
ceries and rent, Americans like Vic-
toria Stuessel from Los Angeles, a
mother of three who was just diagnosed
with MS.
Because of the high cost of her medi-
cations which she uses to delay the
progress of her disease, she was forced
to skip doses. But this is just one of
many stories of people like Victoria
who ration their care or stop taking
their medication altogether.
Not only is this dangerous, but it
could result in death.
The Strengthening Healthcare and
Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act
is the first step to stop the rigging of
the system so there is no delay to get
generics to consumers faster.
That will increase competition, and
it will keep drug prices down for con-
sumers.
While there is still much more work
that needs to be done to drive down the
price of prescription drugs, this bill is
a strong first step in ensuring that all
Americans can afford the medication
they need.
Let’s pass this bill and move forward
in helping consumers.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I continue
to reserve the balance of my time.

system by, one, lowering the cost of
prescription drug prices and, two, in-
creasing access to care.
Included in this package is my bill,
the MORE Health Education Act,
which will restore funding to the Af-
fordable Care Act’s marketing and out-
reach programs and, according to the
CBO, help an additional 5 million
Americans get health coverage.
Educating Americans about when
they can enroll and what their options
are gets more people covered, creates a
better risk pool, brings down some of
the cost of high premiums, and gets us
one step closer to stabilizing the indi-
vidual marketplace.
ACA outreach not only boosts enroll-
ment, but is also cost effective. The
private sector spends between $250 and
$1,000 per enrollment; however, it costs
the government just $29 to enroll some-
one in the individual marketplace
using TV ads—$29.
The goal of affordable, accessible,
and high-quality healthcare is not a D
or an R, it is an A for American.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’
on this bill.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I continue
to reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT), who chairs the
Ways and Means Health Subcommittee.
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I am
here to wade through the pool of croco-
dile tears being shed by Republicans
who, for eight long years, have done
nothing meaningful to address pre-
scription price gouging.
This bill provides some protection
from anticompetitive pharmaceutical
practices. And while it fails to lower
drug prices immediately as we need, it
offers great hope for the future. Key
provisions are substantially the same
as legislation I have introduced twice
before.
Big Pharma depends on monopoly
power to spike prices. Taxpayers fi-
nance much of the drug development;
then the government grants a monop-
oly and, too often, that patent monop-
oly is extended wrongfully by buying
off the competition in what are called
pay-for-delay contracts.
Big Pharma claims that it has to
price-gouge in order to solve and pro-
vide cures for the future. What it is
really innovative about is not cures,
but maintaining its monopoly position.
Today’s modest action is very impor-
tant, but it will not fulfill our Demo-
cratic promise to deliver on lowering
drug costs until we use the full power
of the Federal Government, its pur-
chasing power, to directly negotiate
drug prices, much the way that the
Veterans Administration gets lower
prices for our veterans.
Big Pharma will not yield its monop-
oly prices willingly. It will take more
than a cry of, ‘‘Kumbaya.’’ It will take
enough Members here with the intes-
tinal fortitude to stand up to one of the
most powerful lobbies in America and
provide genuine relief.
Let’s do that.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from New
Jersey (Mr. KIM), who is the sponsor of
the legislation that encourages State
exchanges.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chairman, I rise today
in support of taking action to lower
healthcare and prescription drug costs.
In each of my townhalls, I heard from
my neighbors that they are tired of the
politics; they can’t afford the partisan-
ship; and they need Congress to be the
adults in the room and to act now. I
am proud that my bill, the SAVE Act,
has been incorporated into the bill that
we will be voting on today.
The SAVE Act came from a conversa-
tion, a single conversation, as I
reached across the aisle to Congress-
man BRIAN FITZPATRICK, put aside our
parties, and worked together to help
the people we wake up every day com-
mitted to serve.
Congress needs more conversations
like that. Congress needs bold action
like the one we will be taking today. I
call on our colleagues in the House to
recognize that our neighbors need
healthcare relief, and I call on our col-
leagues in the Senate to recognize that
our neighbors cannot wait for that re-
lief to come.
This is our moment to act to lower
healthcare costs. This is our moment
to get something done for the Amer-
ican people.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT).
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr.
Chairman, as I have listened, again, I
want to point out the same thing I
pointed out the other day, that they
act as if you go to the doctor and the
doctor says you have a dreaded disease,
that you can go out the next day and
get an insurance contract. That is sim-
ply not true.
Affordable Care Act contracts are not
available until January 1 of next year.
You can sign up for them starting in
November, but you will not have cov-
erage until the first of next year.
And if you think healthcare was ex-
pensive and insurance was expensive
before the Affordable Care Act, you
sure ought to look at it now, because it
is significantly more.
I just want to point out that there is
a lot of good stuff in this legislation,
there really is. I commend both the
Democrats and the Republicans on the
committee for the work that is done to
help the American citizens on the pre-
scription drug issue.
But as a Representative who has 24
counties, in over half the counties that
I represent, they have only one insur-
ance carrier—only one insurance car-
rier. I can tell you these skinny plans
are important. If you lose your cov-
erage, where we live, it is, in many
cases, the only thing that is available
to you.
Is it what people want to have? Is it
what we want people to have? I would
tell you, no, it is not, but it is sure bet-
ter than nothing.
So I hope that, as things move for-
ward, we will be able to get some
things done on the prescription drugs.
But again, 24 counties that I rep-
resent, half of them only have one in-
surance option. Those insurance car-
riers, exempt from the antitrust laws
of the country—that is the way they
wrote the Affordable Care Act. They
left them exempt from the antitrust
laws of the country.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
Minnesota (Mrs. CRAIG).
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Chairman, I join my
colleagues today in strong support of
the Strengthening Health Care and
Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act.
Healthcare is the number one issue I
hear about from the families that I rep-
resent, and we must do the right thing
for the American people and finally
focus on lowering the cost of
healthcare.
As a child, in my own family, we
struggled at times to afford health in-
surance. I know directly that, if
healthcare isn’t affordable, it isn’t ac-
cessible. That is why I have cospon-
sored bills in this package to lower pre-
scription drug costs and stabilize the
Affordable Care Act.
It is unacceptable that 29 percent of
Americans ration lifesaving medicine
because they cannot keep up with the
cost. We need to stop brand-name drug
companies from keeping affordable ge-
neric alternatives from the market and
support efforts to develop lower cost
options for families. These efforts have
bipartisan support, and I am proud to
support them.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, may I
inquire again about the amount of time
on each side.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Or-
egon has 30 seconds remaining. The
gentleman from New Jersey has 5 min-
utes remaining.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. NEGUSE).
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chairman, across
the State of Colorado and across my
district, the cost of healthcare is an ur-
gent concern to so many of my con-
stituents. That is why I am proud to
support the legislation championed by
our chairman today.
Today’s legislation will provide
much-needed reforms to lower the cost
of healthcare, protect people with pre-
existing conditions, and lower the cost
of prescription drugs—and these re-
forms are urgently needed.
We know for a fact that American
consumers pay far more for prescrip-
tion drugs than it costs to manufacture
them. In Colorado, over half a million
people each year don’t fill a prescrip-
tion because of the cost—half a million
people. The burden has led to heart-
breaking stories across my State and

across the Nation of individuals forced
to choose between feeding their loved
ones and taking life-sustaining medica-
tions.
Today’s legislation will provide
much-needed reforms, will lower pre-
scription drug costs by ending the tac-
tics used by so many drug manufactur-
ers to keep less expensive drugs off the
market, and will bring generics to mar-
ket faster.
I urge passage of the provisions on
the floor today to ensure that no
American has to skip doses of life-
saving medication because of the cost
and no American goes bankrupt paying
for their healthcare.
I thank the chairman again for his
leadership in championing this legisla-
tion.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I continue
to reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. JEFFRIES), the Democratic
Caucus chair.
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the distinguished chair for his
leadership on this critically important
issue.
The reckless and reprehensible Re-
publican assault on healthcare is un-
American, unconscionable, and unac-
ceptable.
This administration wants to take
away healthcare protection from tens
of millions of Americans.
This administration wants to impose
an age tax on people between 50 and 64,
which will dramatically increase pre-
miums, copays, and deductibles.
This administration wants to take
away protections for those with pre-
existing conditions, adversely impact-
ing more than 100 million Americans.
Here is the Democratic response:
Keep your hands off of the healthcare
of everyday Americans.
Our legislation will strengthen the
Affordable Care Act, protect people
with preexisting conditions, lower
healthcare costs, and drive down the
high costs of lifesaving prescription
drugs because Democrats believe that,
in this great country, no American
should ever have to choose between
putting food on the table, paying the
rent, or getting access to lifesaving
medication. We believe that healthcare
is a right; it is not a privilege. We are
not going backward; we are just going
to move forward.
This is the wealthiest country in the
history of the world. Every single
American should have access to high-
quality and affordable healthcare, and
we are taking a substantial step in
that direction today.
I thank the chair and the tremendous
members of the relevant committees
for their great work.
Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I
think I am prepared to close, but I just
want to ask about the time on each
side once more.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
New Jersey has 2 minutes remaining.
The gentleman from Oregon has 30 sec-
onds remaining.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself the balance of my time, as I
have no other speakers.
I would just like to point out, make
clear for the RECORD and for all our
colleagues, Republicans supported and
worked closely with our Democratic
colleagues on the drug reform bills
here to get lower cost prescriptions and
more generics into the market sooner.
There is no light between our shoulders
on those issues.
If those bills were brought here inde-
pendently as they came out of com-
mittee independently, they would be
headed to the Senate and likely to the
President, and we would be moving for-
ward. But, instead, Democrats merged
in bills they know Republicans oppose.
When it comes to navigators, the ac-
tual number is $767 per individual the
navigators signed up; agents and bro-
kers cost $240 per enrollee. Mr. Chair-
man, we would rather take that money
and put it into community health cen-
ters. That would take care of 20,000 pa-
tients, just at $2.7 million.
Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to
the bill, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
b 1400
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I want to acknowledge the
many Members who wanted to lend
their strong support to this legislation
but were unable to add themselves as
cosponsors due to this package being
combined for floor consideration as
part of the Rules Committee pro-
ceedings. Those Members include the
sponsors of the individual bills incor-
porated into this package, as well as
Members like Representative SHEILA
JACKSON LEE who strongly support our
efforts to make healthcare more acces-
sible and affordable.
Let me say, Mr. Chairman, in clos-
ing, as Democrats, we promised, and we
will fulfill the promise, that we are
going to make healthcare more afford-
able, that we are going to bring down
the costs of prescription drugs, that we
are going to make sure people who
have preexisting conditions are pro-
tected, and that we are offering robust,
comprehensive plans with all the essen-
tial benefits as part of the package.
That is what this bill is about. That
is what the bill last week was about as
well, guaranteeing that if you have a
preexisting condition, you will get af-
fordable health coverage, and saying
that in the case of prescription drugs,
90 percent of prescription drugs now
have or could have a generic alter-
native to bring down costs.
They bring them down considerably,
but the brand-name drug companies
have conspired, in many cases, to make
it more difficult for generics to come
to market and delayed them coming to
market. That drives up the costs of
prescription drugs.
We have watched this Trump admin-
istration sabotage the Affordable Care
Act and put out junk plans so people
don’t have comprehensive coverage and
people with preexisting conditions
have trouble finding affordable cov-
erage. They have made it more dif-
ficult for people to even know what to
buy in the marketplace by cutting
back on navigators and the outreach
that makes people aware. They have
also made it so that many people, un-
fortunately, don’t even have options.
We are going to do whatever we can.
Republicans may like some bills, and
they may not like others, but we are
going to move forward with a package
today and also in the future on what-
ever we can to make premiums more
affordable and to bring down drug
prices.
Mr. Chair, I urge support for these
bills for those reasons, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. SCOTT) and the gentlewoman
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each
will control 15 minutes.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support
of this bill to improve access to quality
health coverage, protect the Affordable
Care Act, and cut prescription drug
costs for consumers.
Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, the ad-
ministration has consistently under-
mined quality, affordable coverage
that Americans have come to expect.
House Republicans actually passed a
bill last year that CBO concluded
would provide coverage for over 20 mil-
lion fewer people, would increase pre-
miums 20 percent the first year, would
cover less, and would jeopardize protec-
tions for those with preexisting condi-
tions.
We can do better.
Mr. Chairman, I want to speak on
one important provision of H.R. 987
that reverses the administration’s at-
tempt to proliferate junk insurance
plans.
Mr. Chairman, for healthier, younger
Americans, short-term junk plans may
sound like a good idea. Unfortunately,
those policies will fail to cover essen-
tial benefits and will lack consumer
protections. They may not provide de-
cent coverage for when they get sick.
The major problem with the pro-
liferation of junk plans is the fact that
they allow insurance companies to sell
plans to healthy people only, meaning
that everybody else would be in an in-
surance pool that is sicker than they
are today. While a privileged few may
pay less, everybody else will pay more.
In fact, one study showed that the
combination of all these junk plans and
lack of mandates and other sabotage of
the Affordable Care Act could result in
thousands of dollars more for every-
body else to pay.
These plans will raise costs for most
Americans, and that is a step in the
wrong direction.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3864 May 16, 2019
Mr. Chairman, we should be reducing
the cost of insurance for most Ameri-
cans, not increasing the cost.
Mr. Chair, this bill will prevent the
administration from going in the
wrong direction, so I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 987.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise as leader of the
Republicans on the committee of juris-
diction over employer-sponsored
healthcare, the House Committee on
Education and Labor.
We have a vital stake in this debate
because that is how most Americans
get their healthcare, through their em-
ployer. Our focus should be on improv-
ing those options. Instead, we are here
so our Democratic colleagues can grind
an ax against the few remaining
healthcare options they don’t get to
control.
Among its many choice-eliminating,
freedom-limiting provisions, this legis-
lation would eliminate short-term,
limited-duration insurance plans.
These plans are an obvious potential
solution for millions of Americans,
working or not, who may find them-
selves between jobs or unable to afford
rising premiums in the already expen-
sive individual market.
If any of my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle claim to be champions
for hardworking Americans or the un-
employed, their support for this provi-
sion is proof that those claims are
empty.
It is worth noting for the RECORD
that short-term, limited-duration plans
were legal under the Obama adminis-
tration and that States still have the
authority to regulate these plans both
under the Obama administration and
under the current rules. If States
choose to limit or prohibit the sale of
these plans, they are free to do so.
By considering this bill, House Demo-
crats are once again defaulting to their
standard uncreative, blind support for
one-size-fits-all Federal mandates in-
stead of respecting the judgment of
State lawmakers and authorities, as
well as individuals, to act in their
States’ and their own best interests.
Republicans on the Education and
Labor Committee have been and re-
main fully dedicated to protecting
Americans with preexisting conditions
and unleashing new customizable, af-
fordable, workable healthcare options
that take into account the changing
needs of all Americans at all stages of
life.
The bill before the House today will
not lower drug prices, will not protect
anyone from surprise billings, will not
lower premiums, will not cut any out-
of-pocket costs, and will not provide
one cent of tax relief.
Its failure to achieve any of those ob-
jectives makes it simply unacceptable
for us as Republicans.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD).
Ms. WILD. Mr. Chairman, I thank
Mr. SCOTT for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R.
987. I am proud that we are about to
follow through on key campaign prom-
ises: lowering drug costs by removing
barriers to generic drugs coming to
market, reversing the sabotage of the
ACA, and rescinding the administra-
tion’s rule to expand junk plans.
As we all know, Congress sometimes
engages in hyperbole, but this is not
hyperbole: These plans are truly junk.
They are not required to include essen-
tial benefit coverage requirements of
the ACA. They can deny consumers
coverage or charge more based on age,
gender, or health status. They come
with no guarantees for basic benefits
like maternity care, mental
healthcare, prescription drug coverage,
and other preventive services. They are
not subject to the out-of-pocket limita-
tions of the ACA that are designed spe-
cifically to protect consumers.
I know a bit about these junk plans
because I spent time over Mother’s Day
weekend desperately helping my 26-
year-old son find insurance coverage.
In March, he turned 26 and found him-
self uninsured. He is in a sandwich sit-
uation between his 26th birthday and
when he will again become eligible for
employer-provided healthcare.
Only because I have read countless
insurance policies over the years of my
legal career did my son avoid the trap
of paying $6,000 for a policy that would
afford him almost no coverage with a
$10,000 deductible. That deductible
would have applied even to his pre-
scription drugs, of which he needs one.
Just as important, my son is exactly
the kind of person we need in the mar-
ketplace.
Let’s encourage robust participation
in marketplace plans, which was the
intent of the Affordable Care Act.
These junk plans lure young, healthy
people away from the ACA pool of
plans, resulting in more expensive pre-
miums for the rest of Americans.
Let’s pass this bill.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CLINE).
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Chairman, well, here
we go again, another bait and switch
by the Democrats.
We have a great bill, the CREATES
Act, that allows consumers to access
cheaper generic drugs, driving down
costs, saving Americans $3.9 billion
over 10 years.
What have they done with it? They
have stuck in poison pills designed to
take choice away from Americans
when it comes to their health insur-
ance plans.
As lawmakers, we owe it to Ameri-
cans to protect their rights to make
their own decisions, particularly as it
relates to healthcare. The fact that we
are here debating even further reducing
these options available to Americans
proves that we are not keeping up our
end of the bargain.
ObamaCare created a healthcare par-
adigm that aimed to take away options
from Americans and give that author-
ity to the government. As a result, pre-
miums are skyrocketing, with the
highest in the country being in my
home State of Virginia.
President Trump, thankfully, has
stepped in to allow flexible, short-
term, limited-duration plans to help
those in my district, where my con-
stituents are pleading for more choices
in health insurance. This administra-
tion is simply trying to give more op-
tions to Americans in this desert of
choice.
We should be creating an environ-
ment that encourages more choices for
individuals and families. This includes
a more individualized market, particu-
larly with regard to employer-spon-
sored health insurance.
It also means increasing pricing
transparency at the point of sale to
avoid surprise medical billing, which
the President championed last week.
Finally, we should address consolida-
tion in the healthcare system through
increased enforcement from the FTC
and the DOJ under the Sherman Anti-
trust Act.
This legislation is the height of arro-
gance. Government knows best, yet
again. The American people know
nothing about their own choices when
it comes to health insurance.
To double down on ObamaCare and
take away the few options that are left
for constituents, and giving those
choices to those who caused this fail-
ure in the first place, the Federal Gov-
ernment, is beyond offensive to Amer-
ican citizens.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
join me in rejecting this legislation.
Reject this idea that government
knows best, and stand up for affordable
and accessible health insurance for all
Americans.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from North Carolina (Ms.
ADAMS).
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman from Virginia for yield-
ing and for his support on this issue.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong sup-
port of H.R. 987. We must reverse the
administration’s attempt to sabotage
the Affordable Care Act.
Healthcare should not be a partisan
issue. It doesn’t matter if you are a
Democrat, Republican, or unaffiliated.
If you get sick, you need to see a doc-
tor. Your body certainly doesn’t make
the distinction about what your poli-
tics are.
The ACA has given millions of Amer-
icans, including 500,000 in my home
State of North Carolina, access to qual-
ity and affordable care. That is huge
because people need healthcare.
No one should worry about losing ac-
cess to quality, affordable health insur-
ance because of a preexisting condi-
tion. We all have them.

Black women shouldn’t have to

cause they don’t have equal access to

I am proud to support H.R. 987 to in-
vest in quality healthcare for the
American people, a healthcare system
that works for everyone.
b 1415
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P.
ROE), the distinguished ranking mem-
ber of the Veterans Affairs’ Committee.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chairman, I rise today in opposition to
H.R. 987, the Democrats’ ObamaCare
bailout act. This legislation includes
three bipartisan bills that could help
lower the cost of prescription drugs.
Unfortunately, the majority has de-
cided to package these positive bills
with four bills that double down on
trying to force ObamaCare on people
who don’t want it and can’t afford it.
We are back on the floor again using
valuable time to consider legislation
that will not pass the Senate. Make no
mistake: If House Democrats wanted to
accomplish something, they could have
put their three drug pricing bills on the
floor by themselves today and they
would have passed. Everyone needs to
understand that.
Instead of working together to find
ways to bring down the costs of
healthcare, House Democrats are act-
ing to eliminate affordable options
that many folks across the country
rely upon for covering their family’s
healthcare needs.
One provision in this bill would be to
limit the availability of short-term
limited duration plans to no more than
3 months. This change by President
Obama went into effect January of 2017
and overturned 20 years of regulations
that had been in place since Bill Clin-
ton was in office, including the en-
tirety of President Obama’s adminis-
tration.
These plans are for essential health
benefits chosen by the individual con-
sumer, not the Federal Government.
We have different needs at different
points in our life. Unfortunately, the
ACA does not allow for plans to be sold
as ‘‘compliant’’ unless they contain
government approved what you need,
not what you and your family decide
what is in your best interest and can
afford.
If my colleagues want to get rid of
junk plans, they can start by working
with us to get rid of ObamaCare.
In my district, while the individual
mandate was in effect, there were 20,000
people who purchased their coverage
through the exchange and about 15,000
who paid the penalty. Many of those
people who paid the penalty were able
to find a plan that was affordable
through the Tennessee Farm Bureau or
the Christian sharing ministries.
I have said it before and I will say it
again: ObamaCare is a good deal for
you if you get a subsidy, of which
about 90 percent do. But these sub-
sidies hide the true cost of the care,
and for people who don’t receive a sub-
sidy, it is unaffordable.
When the Education and Labor Com-
mittee marked up the short-term bill
last month, I heard the argument that
these short-term plans were too dif-
ficult to understand, that consumers
don’t know what they are getting.
This is offensive to me. This is say-
ing, just because patients don’t choose
plans that Washington bureaucrats
think are good for them, they don’t
have enough sense to figure it out on
their own.
They do. I trust the American people.
Why on earth when we do something
using common sense and creating asso-
ciation health plans that allow small
groups to get together—Washington
State does that, hardly a conservative
State. They have had AHPs for over 20
years, and they are working well.
If my friends across the aisle want to
engage in a good faith effort to find so-
lutions to high healthcare costs, I am
all in, Mr. Chairman. I want to help.
But the point is that people are finding
ways outside of ObamaCare to best ac-
cess coverage for their families.
The CBO initially said there would be
27 million people in the exchanges in
2019. That number is 8 million. Com-
petition works.
I hope my colleagues oppose this leg-
islation, and I am ready to work in a
bipartisan way to solve these problems.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, may I inquire as to the
amount of time left.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. SABLAN). The
gentlewoman from North Carolina has
61⁄2 minutes remaining. The gentleman
from Virginia has 10 minutes remain-
ing.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
CICILLINE).
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, every
day in kitchens and living rooms all
across America, working men and
women sit down and try to figure out
how to pay for their prescription drugs.
That is because 25 percent of the people
in this country can’t afford the medi-
cine they have been prescribed.
Seniors are choosing between COPD
and their the groceries. People with
cancer are being forced to delay their
treatment, cut pills in half, or even
forgo treatment altogether. This is
happening in the richest, most power-
ful nation in the history of the world.
It is a disgrace.
If government is going to work for
the people, then the people who serve
in government need to end this crisis,
and Democrats are committed to doing
just that. We are taking on the big
pharmaceutical companies and their
lobbyists, and we are going to get the
job done.
That is why I am proud that my leg-
islation, the CREATES Act, is included
in this legislative package. The CRE-
ATES Act will save taxpayers $3.9 bil-
lion, according to the CBO, and bring
down the cost of some prescription
drugs by as much as 85 percent.
The CREATES Act does this by di-
rectly addressing the abusive delay
tactics that big drug companies use to
block or delay generic competitors
from entering the market.
Over the past decade, some of the
biggest drug companies have abused
regulatory protocols so they can pre-
vent the sale of affordable drugs. This
lets them maintain their control of the
marketplace, pull in monopoly profits,
and keep their prices at inflated levels.
If it is signed into law, the CREATES
Act will create a tailored path for ge-
neric drug competitors to obtain the
samples that are necessary for regu-
latory approval of their lower cost for-
mulations.
I am proud that this bill is not only
backed by many of our colleagues, but
it also has the support of a diverse coa-
lition of healthcare providers, patient
groups, and public interest organiza-
tions, including AARP and Public Cit-
izen. And I am proud it is included in
this package today.
The majority leader in the Senate
likes to describe himself as the grim
reaper for Democratic legislative pro-
posals. I hope that won’t be the case
here. He needs to put the interests of
the American people ahead of his ob-
session with fighting Democrats every
step of the way.
The CREATES Act and these other
proposals that are contained in this
package deserve an up-or-down vote in
the United States Senate. The Amer-
ican people deserve relief from these
outrageous prescription drug prices,
and this legislation will achieve that.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG),
the distinguished Republican leader on
the Subcommittee on Health, Employ-
ment, Labor and Pensions.
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today in opposition to H.R. 987, and I
truly lament the fact that the other
side is once again, under their leader-
ship’s direction, trying to score polit-
ical points instead of truly solving
problems.
Republicans and Democrats agree on
the need to tackle out-of-control pre-
scription drug costs. It is an issue that
touches all of our districts. People are
struggling and in need of relief.
All of the names mentioned today,
the illustrations, from the Speaker of
the House on to my colleagues, names
that were mentioned of people who are
hurting and need relief from drug
costs, are being let down by the Demo-
crat leadership today.
Up until today, we have been work-
ing together on solutions. On the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee on
which I sit, as well, we passed three
drug pricing bills with overwhelming
bipartisan support: The CREATES Act,
the Protecting Consumer Access to Ge-

talked about today who needs afford-
able prescription drugs. They are cost-
ly provisions that bail out failed
ObamaCare programs and strip away
affordable healthcare options for fami-
lies.
The Democrats also rejected a num-
ber of commonsense amendments, in-
cluding one I offered to protect ex-
panded access to association health
plans. These association health plans
give more affordable options to work-
ers and small businesses to purchase
healthcare that fits their needs. We
should be encouraging these options,
not removing them.
But most of all, today should be a
moment of bipartisanship, a moment of
meaningful results. We had an oppor-
tunity to get something done today on
behalf of our constituents who are
struggling with skyrocketing costs of
prescription drugs. Instead, politics got
in the way and we missed that oppor-
tunity.
The American people deserve better
than that, and I think most of us are
better than that. We stand ready to
work on lowering prescription drug
costs.
I hope our colleagues on the other
side of the aisle will talk to their lead-
ership and put politics aside and join
us in that effort. I believe we and they
are better than that and that, by
standing up to leadership that wants to
make it political, if they do that, we
can get this done. I stand ready to
work.
I hate to do this, Mr. Chairman. I
want to keep talking about this and
get a solution, but my time is up.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I
am pleased to rise and support, enthu-
siastically, H.R. 987, the Strengthening
Health Care and Lowering Prescription
Drug Costs Act.
This omnibus bill combines three key
bills to lower drug costs by promoting
generic competition—long overdue—
and four key bills to strengthen
healthcare, reverse the GOP sabotage,
and rescind the Trump administra-
tion’s devastating junk plan rule.
I know full well what happens when
individuals are impacted by junk plans,
and they don’t have the courage they
need. I encourage my good friends on
the other side of the aisle to drop poli-
tics and join with us to pass this legis-
lation.
This omnibus bill invests most of the
savings of $13.8 billion created by its
cracking down on junk plans into
strengthening healthcare, which will
fund about 500,000 additional enrollees
into non-group coverage and Medicaid.
Let me say to you, in 2017, due to the
direct interference by the Trump ad-
ministration, the number of uninsured
people increased by 700,000, the first in-
crease since implementation of the Af-
fordable Care Act.
I know full well that Texas, which is
the number one State in the number of
uninsured, is experiencing the devasta-
tion of not having the expanded Med-
icaid and the Affordable Care Act at its
fullest.
We had a roundtable discussion with
people who experience diabetes. Insulin
is going through the roof. These people
are suffering. The average uninsured
resident in my congressional district
pays 23 times more for a form of insu-
lin than people living in Australia, 15
times more than they would in the
United Kingdom, and 13 times more
than they would in Canada.
Let’s protect those with preexisting
conditions, and let’s pass this bill to
bring down these drugs and save the
lives of our constituents.
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R.
987, the Strengthening Health Care and Low-
ering Prescription Drug Cost Act.
This is an omnibus bill that includes the:
H.R. 938, The BLOCKING (Bringing Low-
Cost Options and Competition While Keeping
Incentives for New Generics) Act;
H.R. 1499, Protecting Consumer Access to
Generic Drugs of 2019;
H.R. 965, The CREATES (Creating and Re-
storing Equal Access to Equivalent Samples)
Act; and
H.R. 1010, Rescinding Trump Administra-
tion’s Final Rule Promoting Junk Insurance
Plans.
This omnibus bill invests most of the sav-
ings of $13.8 billion created by its cracking
down on junk plans into strengthening health
care, which will fund about 500,000 additional
enrollees in nongroup coverage and Medicaid.
Health care should be a fundamental right
for all Americans.
This is why I introduced the Breath of Fresh
Air Act, which establishes a Department of
Education grant program to be used by local
education agencies for the purchase of
nebulizers for use in elementary and sec-
ondary schools and secured passage of
Amendments to the Commerce Justice State
spending bills that preserve and expand upon
green spaces needed to reduce the worse
symptoms of respiratory illnesses.
Each Congress I have secured adoption of
amendments to Department of Defense Ap-
propriations and Authorization Bills that in-
crease funding for triple negative breast can-
cer research and treatment.
I am an original sponsor of H.R. 366, the In-
sulin Access for All Act of 2019, which ad-
dresses the extreme financial hardship most
vulnerable Americans face and too many may
face untimely deaths due to insulin rationing.
Last month, I held a forum in my Congres-
sional district in Houston Texas that engaged
physicians, patients, public health officials in a
discussion about the high cost of insulin.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) led to his-
toric gains in health insurance coverage by ex-
tending Medicaid coverage to many low-in-
come individuals and providing Marketplace
subsidies for individuals below 400 percent, of
poverty.
The number of uninsured nonelderly Ameri-
cans decreased from over 44 million in 2013,
the year before major provisions of the ACA
went into effect, to just below 27 million in
2016.
Unfortunately, the Trump Administration has
been doing all that it can to undermine the
ACA and deny deserving Americans access to
affordable health insurance.
In 2017, due to direct interference by the
Trump Administration the number of uninsured
people increased by nearly 700,000 people,
the first increase since implementation of the
ACA.
One of the most difficult challenges are the
hurdles to healthcare created by lack of health
insurance and the expense of prescription
medication.
In 2017, private health insurance coverage
continued to be more prevalent than govern-
ment coverage, at 67.2 percent and 37.7 per-
cent, respectively.
Of the subtypes of health insurance cov-
erage, employer-based insurance was the
most common, covering 56 percent of the
population for some or all of the calendar
year, followed by Medicaid (19.3 percent),
Medicare (17.2 percent), direct-purchase cov-
erage (16.0 percent), and military coverage
(4.8 percent).
Unfortunately, the state of Texas remains
the state with the most uninsured persons at
17 percent because it refuses to accept fed-
eral Medicaid funding to cover the poorest
residents of the state.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation,
one in four people taking prescription drugs
report difficulty affording their medication.
In 2017, diabetes contributed to the death of
277,000 Americans—and was the primary
cause of death for 85,000 of those individuals.
That same year diagnosed diabetes cost the
United States an estimated $327 billion—in-
cluding $237 billion in direct medical costs and
$90 billion in productivity losses.
Diabetes drugs, including insulin and oral
medications that regulate blood sugar levels,
play a critical role in helping people with dia-
betes manage their condition and reduce the
risk of diabetes-related health complications.
After the Democrats took control of the
House in January we got to work on a report
on the high cost of insulin and we determined
that the Americans with diabetes are in crisis.
Insulin—used by approximately 7.5 million
Americans to treat their diabetes—was discov-
ered nearly a century ago by Canadian re-
searchers Frederick Banting, Charles Best,
J.B. Collip, and J.J.R. Macleod, who assigned
their patent to the University of Toronto with
the goal of making the medication widely
available.
The researchers charged $3.00 to transfer
ownership of insulin to the University of To-
ronto.
Even though analog insulin has been on the
market for nearly 30 years, it has no meaning-
ful generic competition.
Over the past two decades, manufacturers
have systematically and dramatically raised
the prices of their insulin products by more
than tenfold—often in lockstep.
These prices dwarf manufacturing costs.
One study found manufacturers could
charge as little as $7 to $11 per month for in-
sulin and still make a profit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3867
May 16, 2019
In recent years, the high prices of diabetes
drugs have placed a tremendous strain on dia-
betes patients as well as the federal govern-
ment, which provides diabetes medications to
more than 43 million Medicare beneficiaries.
Reva Verma, is a type 1 diabetic who faces
firsthand the struggles of managing diabetes
in an era of skyrocketing insulin prices.
Diabetes is a life-threatening disease that
disproportionately affects communities of
color.
Diabetes is associated with serious health
problems, including heart disease and stroke,
kidney failure, and blindness.
There are 15,000 Medicare beneficiaries in
the Eighteenth Congressional District who
have been diagnosed with diabetes.
These individuals are my constituents and I
know that on average, each of them pay 4.8
times the cost of similar medication in Aus-
tralia, 3.6 times the cost in the United King-
dom, and 2.6 times the cost in Canada.
Additionally, in the Eighteenth Congres-
sional District, there are 191,000 uninsured
residents in this district and, because they lack
insurance, they often pay significantly more
than their insured counterpart, or any patient
overseas.
The average uninsured resident in my con-
gressional district pays 23 more times for a
form of insulin than people living in Australia,
15 more times than they would in the United
Kingdom, and 13 more times than they would
in Canada.
The consequences of these staggering
costs are not benign.
Many patients often speak of having to
make heart-wrenching decisions about what to
buy with the commonly fixed incomes attend-
ant to seniors.
Many medical professionals indicate that the
high prices for prescription drugs are a func-
tion of a lack of competition, and authorizing
Medicare to create a program to negotiate
drug prices may be an estimable way to lower
the cost of prescription drugs.
All told this reflects a disturbing trend: in our
country, the cost of branded drugs tends to go
up, whereas in other countries, the costs tend
to go down.
These high prices lead many people to ra-
tion or stop taking their medications, which
can result in serious health complications and
even death, as the Energy and Commerce
Committee heard in direct testimony earlier
this year.
The prices of diabetes medications—and in-
sulin in particular—are far higher in the United
States than they are overseas, in part be-
cause certain federal programs lack the au-
thority to negotiate directly with drug manufac-
turers.
The Democratic majority came into office
with a promise to the American people, to
make sure that they had affordable and de-
pendable healthcare.
Today, we are delivering on that promise,
not just for persons with diabetes but for all
Americans who have pre-existing conditions
that require medication management.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Idaho (Mr. FULCHER).
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to H.R. 987, as well, for a
number of reasons; but one in par-
ticular that has been raised already is
the provision that it terminates the
short-term limited duration insurance
provision.
Now, these are a good thing, and they
have been good for Idaho. Idaho has
been one of the States that has been
leading on this front.
Mr. Chairman, before the Affordable
Care Act, the average premium in our
State was $1,915. After the Affordable
Care Act, that premium average went
to $5,267. And that is, from what I un-
derstand, not unlike what has hap-
pened in other States, because the
young and the healthy left the plans.
That left the older, less healthy who
were remaining in those plans, and it
has driven those costs up.
The younger and the more healthy
have gone out of the plan altogether or
they have joined a Medi-Share. But the
point is that it has driven those num-
bers up significantly.
In my State, the legislature passed a
3-year provision for short-term plans,
and it is good for everyone. If you are
in between those jobs or if you are in
between coverage for some reason or
you need to maintain continuity
among the plans, it allows for that.
Mr. Chairman, I have heard a couple
of times these referred to as junk. If
they were junk, there wouldn’t be such
demand for it. I would reframe that ar-
gument to say that junk would be bet-
ter described to the system that has
driven those prices up from $1,915 to
$5,267. We want to draw that younger
constituency into those plans. Every-
one wins. We all win when that is the
case.
Mr. Chairman, again, H.R. 987 strikes
that provision, and for that reason, I
will oppose it, and I ask my colleagues
to do the same.
b 1430
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. CLARKE).
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr.
Chairman, I would like to, first of all,
thank the gentlewoman from Delaware
(Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER) for introducing
this very important legislation, and
thank Chairman SCOTT for yielding me
time and for his leadership and support
in continuing to provide access to qual-
ity healthcare for working families.
As vice chair of the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce, I am happy
to stand with my colleagues on the
Education and Labor Committee to
urge my colleagues to support the
Strengthening Healthcare and Low-
ering Prescription Drug Costs Act.
While H.R. 987 is not a panacea to the
many challenges that we face in our
Nation’s healthcare delivery system, it
is sound legislation that will reduce
drug pricing and increase market com-
petition to bring generic drugs to the
market sooner.
It improves the lives of Americans by
lowering the cost of premiums and out-
of-pocket expenses and that presents
real financial hardships to Americans
who have to struggle with limited re-
sources and ask themselves, Do I pay
for medication, or do I purchase food,
or school fees, or transportation to and
from work?
While my home State of New York
has banned the sale of short-term
health insurance plans, they are legal
in other states and often do not provide
a comprehensive level of healthcare in-
surance and coverage in the event of an
emergency.
Mr. Chairman, let’s do the right
thing and enact legislation that will
lower the skyrocketing cost of pre-
scription drugs and give protections to
the consumers of health insurance cov-
erage, lifting the burden of access and
affordability from the American peo-
ple.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT
ROCHESTER).
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. SCOTT), the chairman of the
committee.
According to the Merriam-Webster
Dictionary, ‘‘sabotage’’ is, an act or
process intended to hurt or hamper.
I am a person who is really particular
about words, and I have heard this
word used a lot. And when I look at
what has happened to the Affordable
Care Act over the past few years, the
administration has slashed the enroll-
ment period, we scrubbed the ACA
from government websites, we have cut
in-person assistance, and eliminated
almost all of the educational outreach
for the open enrollment period.
All of the administration’s actions
were intended to deliberately damage
the ACA and hamper American’s access
to affordable, quality healthcare.
I don’t question people’s motivations.
I think we all want the same thing. We
all want healthcare for Americans.
But this bill, H.R. 987, is intended to
do two things. Number one, lower the
cost of prescription drugs, and number
two, strengthen this historic legisla-
tion, the ACA.
Today, we have an opportunity to re-
verse the administration’s relentless
sabotage of the healthcare system and
lower prescription drug prices. And as I
think about individuals in my State, I
think about a woman who came to me
crying because of the cost of her pre-
scription drugs.
Every one of us in here wants to see
something happen. Today, we have the
opportunity to make that happen.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support H.R. 987.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA).
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment expresses the sense of Con-
gress that the secretary should not do
anything that prohibits State insur-
ance commissioners from allowing for
so-called silver loading.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3868 May 16, 2019
Let me walk you through how we got
to this point. Because while silver load-
ing has worked to keep costs on the ex-
change lower for folks who get sub-
sidies, it has only been used because
the President was actively trying to
kill the Affordable Care Act.
In 2017, the President decided to stop
reimbursing health insurance compa-
nies for what are called cost-sharing
reductions, or CSRs.
CSRs are payments that health in-
surance companies are required to
make to help low- and moderate-in-
come people afford healthcare.
Under the Affordable Care Act, the
health insurance companies must help
people that have more affordable, and,
possibly, no co-pays or deductibles.
The Federal Government was sup-
posed to reimburse insurance providers
for making these payments; however,
in October of 2017, the administration
stopped making these payments.
This was a deliberate attempt to
make health insurance on the exchange
unaffordable, and undermine, weaken,
and attack the Affordable Care Act.
In response to this, States let health
insurance plans do what is now called
silver loading. State insurance regu-
lators, in a desperate and creative at-
tempt to stabilize the insurance mar-
ketplaces, allowed insurance compa-
nies to bill the unpaid CSR costs into
their silver plans on the exchange. This
was a very creative attempt to sta-
bilize the insurance market.
This wasn’t the solution that anyone
wanted, but it is a solution that has
worked and has created some stability
and predictability in the insurance
market in the face of an administra-
tion that seeks chaos.
Because the tax credits are
benchmarked to the silver plan, silver
loading has meant that most who re-
ceive subsidies did not see an increase
in their health insurance premiums.
In fact, new data shows that 2.6 mil-
lion healthcare.gov consumers are now
paying lower premiums as a result of
silver loading.
States that allowed for silver loading
as a way to cope with the manufac-
tured chaos that the administration
tried to inflict on the market, actually
saw an increase in enrollment in the
exchanges.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield an additional 30 seconds to
the gentlewoman from Florida.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chairman, the
administration must stop trying to
sabotage the Affordable Care Act.
My amendment expresses that it is
the sense of Congress that the sec-
retary of Health and Human Services
shall not do anything to prohibit the
use of silver loading, a program de-
signed by the States to stabilize the
health insurance marketplace.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I continue to reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, may I inquire as to how much
time each side has remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Virginia has 45 seconds remain-
ing. The gentlewoman from North
Carolina has 1 minute remaining.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, do I have the right to close?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
enjoys the right to close.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I am ready to close, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Mr. Chairman, Republicans predicted
all the bad things that have resulted
from the so-called Affordable Care Act.
It has not been affordable and has actu-
ally increased the cost of health insur-
ance and care.
Unfortunately, our colleagues are so
invested in supporting this legislation
that they blame Republicans for its
failure.
The legislation has failed because it
is hopelessly flawed and cannot be
fixed.
Mr. Chairman, the piece of legisla-
tion before us, as I said earlier, is a
choice-limited, freedom-limiting bill,
and should not pass.
I would also like to make one more
observation.
My colleagues have made repeated
references to junk plans. Every time
they do that, they are insulting the
person who has chosen that plan for
one reason or another due to individual
circumstances or preferences.
Just because a product isn’t some-
thing I would buy, or you would buy,
does that make it junk? No.
Dismissing less expensive and more
flexible health plans as junk isn’t tak-
ing up for anyone, it is actually put-
ting them down.
That is not the way we should be in
this country.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself the balance of my
time.
Mr. Chairman, I just want to say a
final word about these junk plans.
The problem with them is that you
allow them to screen for preexisting
conditions and have lower benefits.
That might be a good idea for the per-
son buying the plan, but what happens
is under the Affordable Care Act every-
body pays an average. If you let
healthy people buy these junk plans,
everybody else’s premium will go up.
This sabotage has been estimated
with this and the other sabotage, thou-
sands of dollars more for everybody
else left behind.
So I rise today in support of the bill,
which will improve access to quality
health coverage, protect the Affordable
Care Act and cut prescription drugs
cost.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Chair, last No-
vember, the American people elected us to
this body because of the urgent need to shore
up our health care system and bring down the
cost of prescription drugs.
Today, we are making good on that promise
to the country by passing another critically-im-
portant piece of legislation.
H.R. 987, the Strengthening Health Care
and Prescription Drugs Act helps protect the
Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the
Trump Administration.
In particular, this bill bans the use of ‘‘junk’’
health care plans that harm people with pre-
existing conditions; it also helps provide states
with more resources to increase health care
coverage.
Second, this legislation helps increase ge-
neric prescription drug competition which will
help bring down prices for patients.
In particular, this legislation includes a bill
that I cosponsored that makes it illegal for pre-
scription drug manufacturers to use a practice
called ‘‘pay-for-delay.’’ This anti-competitive
practice delays generic manufacturers from
bringing cheaper drugs to market. This bill will
prohibit this practice and help increase drug
competition.
This bill will not solve every problem ailing
our health care system, nor will it immediately
fix our prescription drug prices problems.
But the American people deserve these
needed reforms without delay. This bill’s pas-
sage today will help us build additional policies
to shore up our health care system and further
bring down the cost of prescription drugs. I en-
courage all of my colleagues to support it.
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chair, I
would like to revise my remarks made during
general debate of the underlying measure,
H.R. 987. In my remarks, I stated that the
marketing and outreach provision under Title II
of H.R. 987 would increase enrollment into
health plans by five million over the ten year
period as estimated by the Congressional
Budget Office. Due to the methodology adopt-
ed by the Congressional Budget Office to esti-
mate the enrollment effect of the underlying
measure, the figure is more appropriately rep-
resented as increasing enrollment by about
500,000 each year over the ten year period.
The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-
eral debate has expired.
In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce, printed in the bill, an amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute con-
sisting of the text of the Rules Com-
mittee Print 116–14, shall be considered

holder from failing to provide eligible product
developers with sufficient quantities of a cov-
ered product on commercially reasonable, mar-

of any such award.

er for a covered product shall not be liable for

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment
sponsored by myself and the ranking
member of the full committee, Mr.
WALDEN.
We have been considering the CRE-
ATES Act and legislation like it for
years, and it has long been one of my
top priorities. So I was pleased to an-
nounce a bipartisan amendment that
gained the support of our Republican
colleagues during the Energy and Com-
merce Committee’s consideration of
the CREATES bill.
There was only one outstanding con-
cern still to be resolved after that
amendment was adopted. And I am
pleased now to offer a bipartisan solu-
tion to address that concern today.
The concern raised during our full
committee markup was that there was
a lack of specificity in the provisions
that describe the communication re-
quirements related to the request and
the delivery of the requested samples
between the eligible product developer
and the license holder.
This bipartisan amendment filed by
myself and my colleague, the ranking
member of the Energy and Commerce
Committee, Mr. WALDEN, will provide
the additional needed clarity to ensure
that communication requirements in
these negotiations are understood so
that there is certainty for both parties.
So I think we have found agreement
with our colleagues across the aisle
around a shared goal of discouraging
anti-competitive conduct and pro-
viding certainty to both brand and ge-
neric manufacturers about the sample
requests and delivery process.
I appreciate the ranking member and
his staff for working with me in good
faith on this legislation and urge all
my colleagues to vote in support of
this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.

Again, this is an effort to try to
make sure that when a patent expires
that the samples or formula are given
to generic, so they can develop a ge-
neric alternative. That is what the
CREATES Act is all about.
I would urge support for my amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of

The Acting CHAIR. The question is

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. MCKINLEY
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in
House Report 116–61.
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise
as the designee of the gentleman from
Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON), and I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Strike title II (and redesignate the subse-
quent title and update the table of contents
accordingly).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from West Virginia.
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, the
bills to recognize lower drug prices
passed the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee with unanimous bipartisan sup-
port.
They were genuine efforts to address
the most expensive component of
healthcare, but Democrats have pack-
aged these bipartisan drug-pricing so-
lutions with controversial, ideologi-
cally driven legislation that will not be
taken up by the Senate. Shame on
them.
So here we go again. According to
The Washington Post, in so doing, the
Democrats have put a pothole in the
path of drug pricing. We have all seen
the charts and seen the quotes here
earlier in the day.
Mr. Chairman, as the 11th-most bi-
partisan Member of the House, I recog-
nize the importance of playing nice in
the sandbox and putting good legisla-
tion before politics. This combination
fails that test.
My amendment is simple. It would
strike the most controversial portions
from the bill, leaving those areas that
allow us to lower the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs.
Therefore, if your goal is to lower the
cost of prescription drugs, I would en-
courage my friends and colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. But if
you want to play politics with the
healthcare of Americans and see this
bill stopped in the Senate, then vote
‘‘no,’’ and you will see what happens.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from New Jersey is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self 2 minutes.
Mr. Chairman, I am very dis-
appointed that my Republican col-
leagues want to strike all of the ACA
stabilization measures that we passed
through our committee.
These are important bills that should
have strong bipartisan support, but,
unfortunately, my Republican col-
leagues continue to be unwilling to
work together on commonsense pro-
posals that would lower healthcare
costs for consumers.
Funding for outreach and marketing,
why is this even controversial to my
Republican colleagues? Outreach and
advertising are critical to ensuring
that people know about the option to
enroll in comprehensive coverage.
We know that last year just one in
four uninsured people who buy their
own insurance were aware of the open
enrollment season and the deadline to
enroll in coverage.
Another commonsense proposal to
lower healthcare costs is to provide
funds to States to set up State-based
marketplaces. Again, why is this con-
troversial? Over the last few years,
State-based marketplaces have had
lower premiums and better enrollment
than the Federal marketplace.
Enrollment on healthcare.gov has de-
clined due to the Trump administra-
tion’s sabotage. Enrollment in the
State-based marketplaces has actually
increased. The navigator funding provi-
sions the Republicans are trying to
strike from the bill, again, this is a
program to help hard-to-reach individ-
uals sign up for comprehensive cov-
erage.
Finally, the Republicans want to re-
move protection that would block the
Trump administration’s expansion of
junk insurance plans that discriminate
against people with preexisting condi-
tions.
I really can’t understand why my Re-
publican colleagues who claim to sup-
port protections for preexisting condi-
tions want to defend these plans that
discriminate against preexisting condi-
tions and put consumers at extreme fi-
nancial risk, other than the fact this is
a Trump administration initiative, so
they don’t want to oppose it.
In addition to discriminating against
people with preexisting conditions,
these junk plans exclude coverage for
many important benefits, such as ma-
ternity care. And even when you think
you are covered, if you get sick while
you are on one of these, the insurance
companies find a way to avoid paying
the bill.
So in closing, this amendment dem-
onstrates what we all know clearly:
that Republicans don’t want to do any-
thing to actually help lower healthcare
costs for Americans or safeguard pre-
existing condition protections.
Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, this
is the third time today I have heard
the word ‘‘sabotage’’ so that must be
the new operative word coming from
my colleagues across the aisle.
I would submit to you, I will turn the
table back because if there is someone
trying to sabotage the effort of low-
ering healthcare prices, it is you.
Our chairman on the other side, how-
ever, I think genuinely wanted to lower
the healthcare prices when the bills
came out in a nonpartisan fashion
which was universally adopted by us.
But someplace from the time they left
Energy and Commerce to the time they
came to the floor, they were put into
something that the Senate has already
indicated they have no appetite for.
So if we truly want to lower
healthcare prices in this vote, then it
is a ‘‘yes’’ vote. But if you want to sab-
otage this legislation, you go right
ahead and do what you have to do.
So I know, Mr. Chairman, there were
good efforts here, bipartisan efforts to
try to get something done. It looks like
something has crept in to cause a prob-
lem.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. Members are ad-
vised to address their remarks to the

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. CASTOR).
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-
man, we are trying to turn back the
sabotage of the Trump administration
on people’s healthcare for the folks
back home who we represent. The
Trump administration has done every-
thing they can to make it more expen-
sive, whether we are talking about pre-
scription drugs or that all-important
health insurance policy.
Don’t just take it from me and my
Democratic colleagues. Take it from
folks who are on the side of our fami-
lies day in and day out: the American
Cancer Society Cancer Action Net-
work, the American Diabetes Associa-
tion, the American Heart Association,
and the American Lung Association. I
could go on and on.
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD
letters from over 20 health groups that
represent our families back home who
say: Pass this bill.

H.R. 1010, To provide that the rule entitled
‘‘Short-Term, Limited Duration Insurance

duration of short-term health insurance
plans from three months to 364 days. Pre-
viously, short term plans were available to
fill a temporary gap in coverage, such as
gaps in employment. However, since the rule
was finalized, the growth and availability of
these products continues to threaten pa-
tients with pre-existing conditions because
insurers offering these policies can either
deny coverage or charge higher premiums to
individuals with pre-existing conditions. Ex-
panding access to these policies could cause
premiums in the marketplace to increase, as
younger and healthier individuals choose to
enroll in the short-term plans. This forces
individuals with serious or chronic condi-
tions into a smaller, sicker risk pool to ob-
tain the coverage they need to manage their
health. Premiums for these comprehensive
plans would likely skyrocket, making insur-
ance unaffordable.
Short-term plans also lack patient protec-
tions guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act
(ACA), severely impacting individuals with
serious or chronic health conditions. Plan
providers are permitted to consider pre-ex-
isting conditions in decisions to deny cov-
erage, charge higher premiums, or not cover
certain care and treatments. After enrolling
in a short-term plan, providers are permitted
to rescind or amend coverage based on new
health issues. Short-term plans are not re-
quired to cover all of the Essential Health
Benefits (EHBs) categories outlined in the
ACA, potentially forcing individuals to pay
out-of-pocket for expensive treatments.
These plans can also impose lifetime and an-
nual limits on coverage and do not require
limits on out-of-pocket expenses and
deductibles.
H.R. 1010 would both protect patients and
consumers from substandard insurance prod-
ucts and assist in stabilizing the market-
place. The decreased up-front costs of short-
term plans may be more appealing to young-
er, healthier individuals, thus, dividing the
individual marketplace risk pool. Seg-
menting the market in this way will result
in increased premiums for comprehensive
ACA-compliant plans in the marketplace, de-
creasing marketplace stability, and reducing
affordable access to insurance.
It is for these reasons we enthusiastically
endorse your legislation and urge Congress
to act swiftly to limit the sale of short-term
insurance plans. People with pre-existing
conditions need access to adequate, afford-
able health insurance. Again, our organiza-
tions thank you for your leadership on this
critical issue for people with pre-existing
conditions, and we support your efforts to
expand access to affordable health insurance.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE CASTOR: The 23 un-
dersigned organizations, representing mil-
lions of American patients, providers, and
consumers, write today in strong support of
H.R. 1386, Expand Navigator’s Resources for
Outreach, Learning, and Longevity (EN-
ROLL) Act of 2019, which is now included as
a provision in H.R. 987. Our organizations
recognize the importance of navigator pro-
grams to assist potential enrollees with the
open enrollment process. Your legislation
will guarantee resources for navigators, al-
lowing them to continue the important work
of educating Americans about their coverage
and enrollment options.
In March 2017, we identified three over-
arching principles to guide and measure any
work to further reform and improve the na-
tion’s health insurance system. Our core
principles are that health insurance coverage
must be adequate, affordable, and accessible.
Together, our organizations understand what
individuals and families need to prevent dis-
ease, manage health, and cure illness. Our
organizations are deeply concerned about
cuts to these services and the lack of reliable
resources for consumers who have questions
about how to enroll in coverage. We are
pleased that this legislation represents a sig-
nificant and meaningful step towards in-
creasing access to services that help con-
sumers enroll in high-quality health care, in-
cluding Medicare and Medicaid.
Cuts to navigators and outreach and en-
rollment activities since 2016 have taken
away resources that help consumers under-
stand and select health care coverage. Navi-
gators and consumer assisters are critical to
educating the public about their health in-
surance options and helping individuals en-
roll in appropriate coverage. Navigators con-
duct outreach and must provide fair, accu-
rate, unbiased, and culturally appropriate in-
formation to individuals and families regard-
ing eligibility and enrollment requirements
for the marketplaces and other state health
insurance programs. They are valuable allies
to consumers seeking affordable coverage
that meets their needs. Many navigators also
provide in-person help to low-income and
rural communities, consumers with limited
English proficiency, people with disabilities,
and other populations for whom such assist-
ance is not often available.
We strongly and enthusiastically support
your legislation to preserve funding for navi-
gator programs. Informed enrollees can
choose plans that provide the coverage they
need at prices they can afford. Research has
shown that states that devote robust re-
sources to marketing, outreach, and enroll-
ment assistance programs experience higher
rates of enrollment compared to those who
do not. Providing resources to ease the en-
rollment process will help stabilize the mar-
ketplace and result in lower premiums for
many enrollees.
People with pre-existing conditions need
access to adequate, affordable health insur-
ance. In order to be accessible, potential en-
rollees need to understand open enrollment
and coverage options. With the increase of
coverage options that are not compliant
with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), such as
short-term, limited-duration insurance
plans, navigator programs are particularly
important to allow uninsured individuals to
make informed decisions. This legislation
will keep this information accessible to all.
Again, our organizations thank you for your
leadership on this critical issue for people
with pre-existing conditions, and we support
your efforts to expand access to affordable
health insurance.

Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I
wanted to make one more important
point. I have heard so much misin-
formation today from my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle who have
denigrated our navigators. They say
agents and brokers can do the job of
helping to sign up our neighbors for
health insurance.
Boy, that is not the case. Yes, agents
and brokers are important, but we
heard expert testimony in our com-
mittee that the navigators provide
independent, trusted advice. They are
our community-based folks at commu-
nity health centers and groups like the
American Cancer Society, who I men-
tioned, that understand how important
it is.
A lot of the agents and brokers send
their customers over to navigators to
sign up because the agents and brokers
are not interested in going over to
folks who rely on Medicaid, or the Chil-
dren’s Health Insurance Program.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER).
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chair-
man, I oppose this amendment because
by stripping the ACA’s stabilization
bills from this package, we are reneg-
ing on the promise that we made to the
American people: access to quality, af-
fordable healthcare.
This complete package of bills helps
stabilize the ACA which will improve
the risk pool, reduce premium cost,
and lower the number of uninsured.
The CBO found that my bill, the
MORE Health Education Act would
help 5 million Americans obtain high-
quality health insurance created by the
ACA. It is supported by AARP, the
American Hospital Association, and a
number of other organizations, as was
mentioned before.
From day one, there has been a con-
cern that when we shorten the amount
of time that people can enroll, when we
tell them that we are not going to let
them know what is even available to
them, and then we take away the re-
sources and the individuals that can
help them get there, that is why we
feel like we have been watching and
witnessing the move backwards.
What we want to do with this bill is
move forward. So I urge my colleagues
to reject this amendment and support
the full legislative package for the peo-
ple.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I would
just ask Members to oppose this
amendment because it guts the effort
to improve the Affordable Care Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3876 May 16, 2019
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chair, I
would like to revise my remarks made during
debate of amendment No. 2 of H.R. 987, of-
fered by Mr. McKINLEY. In my remarks, I stat-
ed that the marketing and outreach provision
under Title II of H.R. 987 would increase en-
rollment into health plans by five million over
the ten year period as estimated by the Con-
gressional Budget Office. Due to the method-
ology adopted by the Congressional Budget
Office to estimate the enrollment effect of the
underlying measure, the figure is more appro-
priately represented as increasing enrollment
by about 500,000 each year over the ten year
period.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKIN-
LEY).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from West Virginia will
be postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MR. WELCH
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 3 printed in
House Report 116–61.
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Add at the end of title II the following new
section:
SEC. 205. PROTECTION OF HEALTH INSURANCE
COVERAGE IN CERTAIN EXCHANGES.
In the case of an Exchange that the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services oper-
ates pursuant to section 1321(c)(1) of the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42
U.S.C. 18041(c)(1)), the Secretary may not im-
plement any process that would terminate
the health insurance coverage of an enrollee
solely because such enrollee did not actively
enroll during the most recent open enroll-
ment period.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from Vermont (Mr. WELCH) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Vermont.
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, this amendment,
which I will describe in a moment, is
about improving and preserving the Af-
fordable Care Act. The word ‘‘sabo-
tage’’ has been used here. We don’t
need that word. We have a very
straightforward, very transparent dif-
ference of view.
The Democrats supported and passed
the Affordable Care Act. We have been
defending it for years. The Republicans
opposed it. President Trump made it a
campaign pledge to get rid of it, and
they came within a vote in the Senate,
except for John McCain, of repealing
the law altogether.
We don’t have to use words that are
pejorative. We think we should have
the Affordable Care Act. We think we
should make it stronger, and my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
want to vote against it and now want
to repeal it.
b 1500
One of the ways to make the Afford-
able Care Act effective is to have auto-
matic reenrollment. If a family is in
the Affordable Care Act and the time
for reenrollment comes up, if they take
no action, then they are automatically
reenrolled in the plan that they are al-
ready in.
If you take away the automatic re-
enrollment, folks fall off, oftentimes
for no particular reason. They were
doing other things; they didn’t notice
it; they didn’t have the time; or they
didn’t get to a navigator. There are
lots of things that come between auto-
matic reenrollment and picking your
own plan.
By the way, studies have shown that
automatic reenrollment, like auto-
matic withdrawal to go into your re-
tirement account, is very, very effec-
tive.
The President has indicated a desire
to get rid of the automatic reenroll-
ment program. He hasn’t done that yet.
This amendment would prohibit him
from doing so.
There is a reason why the adminis-
tration would like to get rid of auto-
matic reenrollment. The evidence sug-
gests that that would mean about 2
million Americans would then lose ac-
cess to their healthcare because they
hadn’t reenrolled.
We don’t want that to happen. We
want those American families who de-
pend on the healthcare that they have
to continue receiving that healthcare
next year just like they received it this
year.
This amendment makes it very clear
that that automatic reenrollment pro-
gram would continue to be part of the
Affordable Care Act.
Keep in mind, it in no way limits the
ability of a family or an individual to
decide to get into a different plan or to
affirmatively say they don’t want to be
in any plan. That can still happen.
There is total and complete freedom of
choice, but it gives security. It is going
to be very beneficial to about 2 million
American families.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.

will rise informally.

the Senate has passed without amend-
ment a bill of the House of the fol-
lowing title:
H.R. 2379. An act to reauthorize the Bullet-
proof Vest Partnership Grant Program.
The message also announced that the
Senate has passed a bill of the fol-
lowing title in which the concurrence
of the House is requested:
S. 1208. An act to amend the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968

Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I be-
lieve I have the right to close.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Vermont is recognized.
Mr. WELCH. How much time is re-
maining, Mr. Chairman?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 2 minutes remaining.
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, as I men-
tioned earlier, we just have a difference
of opinion. We think the Affordable
Care Act is important to preserve and
important to improve. My colleagues,
when they have had an opportunity,
have voted to repeal it.
Failing to repeal it, what the Trump
administration has done is chip away
at it. We don’t want the administration
to be able to get rid of automatic re-
enrollment, which would likely result
in the loss of 2 million families having
access to healthcare.
There has been a number of other
things that have happened: slashing
funding, slashing funding for consumer
outreach and enrollment education by
90 percent, cutting back the uninsured
rate for 4 years, and 1.1 million Ameri-
cans losing coverage last year.
In the latest ACA marketplace final
rule, the administration openly con-
templated getting rid of this automatic
reenrollment. This amendment pro-
tects the automatic reenrollment. It is
going to protect continued access to
care under the Affordable Care Act for
2 million Americans.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, it is
great being on the floor with a lot of
my friends on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee and my colleagues
across the aisle. Obviously, we have a
fundamental disagreement.
I know, in southern Illinois, one of
the biggest questions I always got and
concerns was that ObamaCare plans
are too expensive, and the deductibles

are too high, so we can’t use them.
Hence, no one wanted to use them.
Part of the change in the political
landscape because of that was Repub-
licans controlled the House. That is
what happened politically. Here we are,
and my colleagues and I have belabored
this point all day, Mr. Chairman, about
what we are trying to do. We are trying
to lower the cost of prescription drugs,
but we have to go back to this
ObamaCare debate.
Republicans control the Senate. They
are not going to bring it up. The Presi-
dent is not going to sign the bill. It is
instructional to have this debate. We
understand it. We will eventually come
back, and we will address these pre-
scription drug bills. We will get there,
but we have to go through this exer-
cise. I understand that.
The three bills that we could vote on
and pass right now, probably on a sus-
pension calendar and a voice vote,
would be the three prescription drug
bills that are part of this package.
Those are the CREATES Act, the Pro-
tecting Consumers’ Access to Generic
Drugs Act, and the Bringing Low-cost
Options and Competition while Keeping
Incentives for New Generics Act, called
the BLOCKING Act.
That is what we could be doing
today, that and some other things. We
hope that what we will be addressing
will make major changes in afford-
ability, transparency, and the like.
My colleagues also point out the nu-
merous votes to repeal or replace parts
of ObamaCare. I am proud to say I
voted for all of them. The facts state
that a lot of Democrats supported
these, to fundamentally change provi-
sions of ObamaCare.
In fact, 30 of the bills my friends are
citing were signed into law. Twenty-
one of those bills were signed into law
by President Obama. Of the 30 that
were signed into law, Speaker PELOSI
voted ‘‘yes’’ on 19 of them. These are
part of the 60 bills that would repeal
and replace, and we have 21, and 19
were voted for by Speaker PELOSI.
Leader HOYER voted ‘‘yes’’ on 21 of
them. My friend Chairman PALLONE
voted on 20 of them.
Here are the examples that we want
to lay out: repealing the unworkable
and unsustainable CLASS Act, rescind-
ing billions of dollars for the failed
ObamaCare co-op program, delaying
the Cadillac tax and medical device
tax, cutting funding to the Independent
Payment Advisory Board, providing
regulatory and financial relief from
ObamaCare’s requirements for small
business and independent contractors,
requiring accurate income verification
before disbursing subsidies to
ObamaCare exchanges, and modifying
eligibility for ObamaCare exchange
subsidies.
We can have this tit for tat, Mr.
Chairman, and they will still want to
defend ObamaCare. We will always say
that the private market is better to
provide lower cost and rapid response.
It is an ideological fight.
We will get through this debate. We
will eventually come back and address
these prescription drug issues that, as I
mentioned, Mr. Chairman, we probably
would pass on a voice vote once we re-
turn to this.
I thank my colleagues. I have great
respect for my colleague from
Vermont. He is a very sincere and good
friend. We look forward to debating
this more in the future.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Chairman, this is a simple
amendment designed to ensure that
Congress is able to review the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services’
own analysis of the ACA’s marketing
and outreach programs.
In April of this year, I led a letter
signed by 30 of my House colleagues on
the Energy and Commerce Committee
requesting HHS disclose any studies
and data related to their marketing
and outreach efforts for the ACA. HHS
and CMS have had more than 50 days
to respond to this request and provide
crucial documents to the public and
Congress. The lack of response con-
firms our concerns about transparency
and commitment to implementing the
current law.
While estimates vary, it is clear that
marketing and outreach efforts created
by the ACA could significantly improve
the lives of tens of thousands of Ameri-
cans. Many of these Americans are
simply unaware of the health insurance
and financial assistance options avail-
able to them. HHS and CMS have the
power and obligation to assist the pub-
lic in understanding these options.
My colleagues would agree that HHS
and CMS also have the obligation to be
good stewards of taxpayer dollars by
doing this effectively. Because of this,
earlier this morning, I sent a follow-up
letter requesting that these documents
be released without delay.
The results of this study need to be
made public so that Congress can enact
effective policy that reaches our com-
mon goal of quality and affordable
health insurance for all Americans.
Simply put, public awareness of the
ACA isn’t as high as folks are made to
believe, and the ACA’s marketing and
outreach program was an effective tool
in helping Americans make informed
decisions for their families.
According to Joshua Peck, a former
senior adviser at CMS who oversaw the
marketing program, the private sector
spends between $250 and $1,000 per en-
rollment. How much did it cost the
Federal Government? Twenty-nine dol-
lars.
It costs government just $29 to enroll
someone in the individual marketplace
using TV ads. That is a good use of tax-
payer dollars.
A July 2018 Government Account-
ability Office report on ACA outreach
and enrollment even cites the HHS’
study, which looked at the most cost-
effective forms of advertising for new
and returning enrollees. The GAO
found that the study named television
ads as one of the best forms of adver-
tising for enrolling Americans. Despite
objective, fact-based analysis, the ad-
ministration eliminated these ads.
Mr. Chairman, I support the under-
lying legislation, and I ask my col-
leagues to support my amendment and
make clear that HHS should be trans-
parent and release these studies.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance

support the underlying bill, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, it is
hard to sell a lemon, no matter how
much you give in advertising. That is
kind of the basis of our opposition to
this amendment.
Mr. Chair, as you heard me say in the
last debate, in my congressional dis-
trict, people didn’t want to be forced to
buy something that was too high, that
was unaffordable, that the deductibles
were too high, and that we in Wash-
ington mandated that they have to
buy.
Now we see a period where, in es-
sence, people have a few more choices
because of the waiver system, the 1332s.
We see people flocking away from

ObamaCare plans to 1332 waivers with-
in the States, which we think is a good
deal.
Part of the debate on this is: Let’s
pump more money in and maybe these
people will stay in these failed
ObamaCare plans. We reject that. We
reject it based upon what we have done
with Medicare Advantage and Medicare
part D.
The executive branch has said: Let’s
spend the same amount of money that
we do for Medicare part D and Medi-
care Advantage, which have much
higher enrollment than the ObamaCare
exchanges.

So we think that is appropriate. We
do think that, with $100 million or
more to try to get people to buy a

down, that is not a good use of money.

AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MR. DESAULNIER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 5 printed in
House Report 116–61.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of title I, add the following:
Subtitle D—Study on Role of Federal
Assistance in Drug Development
SEC. 131. STUDY ON ROLE OF FEDERAL ASSIST-
ANCE IN DRUG DEVELOPMENT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than two years
after the date of the enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of the Health and Human
Services shall enter into a contract with the
National Academy of Medicine to conduct a
study on, and submit to Congress a report
on, the following:
(1) The percentage of drugs developed in
the United States using at least some
amount of Federal funding from any Federal
source.
(2) The average cost incurred by a drug de-
veloper to develop a drug.
(3) The average amount of revenue and
profits made by drug developers from the
sales of drugs.
(4) The percentage of such revenue and
profits that are reinvested into research and
development of new drugs.
(5) The appropriate percentage, if any, of
such revenue and profits the Secretary, in
consultation with the National Academy of
Medicine, recommends should be returned to
Federal entities for Federal funding used in
the development of the drugs involved.
(b) ENFORCEMENT.—A drug developer shall,
as a condition of receipt of any Federal fund-
ing for the development of drugs, comply
with any request for the data necessary to
perform the study under subsection (a).
(c) CONFIDENTIALITY.—This section does
not authorize the disclosure of any trade se-
cret, confidential commercial or financial in-
formation, or other matter listed in section
552(b) of title 5, United States Code.
(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section:
(1) The term ‘‘drug’’ has the meaning given
such term in section 201 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321).
(2) The term ‘‘drug developer’’ means an
entity that submitted, and received approval
of, an application under section 505 of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21
U.S.C. 355) or section 351 of the Public Health
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from California (Mr. DESAULNIER) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman,
my amendment seeks to find informa-
tion that will help with the high cost
of prescription drugs in the United
States, to help inform this institution
and the American public.
Mr. Chair, I have a form of noncur-
able blood cancer. In my pocket is a
pill I take every day that keeps me
alive. It costs $500 a day.
Most of the research that developed
this pill was at the Department of De-
fense and the National Institutes for
Health. American taxpayers did the
basic research.
Earlier today, we had a long hearing
in the Committee on Oversight of a
similar situation where most of the de-
velopment for an HIV lifesaving drug
was developed at the University of
California in San Francisco with NIH
funding and no funding from the drug
supplier that is now making billions of
dollars.
What my amendment does is direct
the Academy of Medicine to get the in-
formation to differentiate what is basic
taxpayer healthcare and how much
that contributes to these billions of
dollars of profits of pharmaceutical
companies.
It is not to say that these private in-
vestments are not good, but are they
low risk and high reward or are they
high risk and high reward? That is to
say: Are the investors getting a really
high risk based on what the taxpayers
have done in investment?
All this amendment does is direct the
Academy of Medicine to come back
with that information.
We hear arguments from our Repub-
lican colleagues often that we need
these investments in private-sector
pharmaceutical companies. I don’t dis-
agree, but we need to know what por-
tion of it is actually returning a rea-
sonable rate of return. We want to at-
tract those investments.
Absent this kind of information, it is
just a political opinion and argument.
My amendment would get to that in-
formation that is so important to this
debate.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I
would hope that all the Members would
support this amendment. It provides us
valuable information by a source that
we all value, the National Academy of
Medicine, and it will get to this argu-
ment of my colleagues across the aisle.
If their argument is right, then the
public and the Congress will see it; it
will be verified. If it is different—and I
believe it is—we will start looking at
the real value of private investment
and the return on investment that is
due the American public.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I don’t
know my colleague very well, but I
think it is instructive to our citizens
as a whole that Members come from
across this great land and have a lot of
different issues. I think it is instruc-
tive that even Members of Congress
can be fighting illnesses and need life-
saving medicine to do that.
I don’t think we are fundamentally
opposed to the amendment. We don’t
think it does exactly what the author
is claiming it will do.
In this package, in this bill, it is not,
obviously, going to go anywhere be-
cause the President is not going to sign
this bill. It is not going to go through
the Senate.
Mr. Chair, I would encourage my col-
league to come back and visit with us
so that we start moving something
that can get bipartisan agreement that
I think would be very instructive in
looking at this as an addition.
Now, I am speaking for myself, not
for the ranking member of the full
committee, because the gentleman is
right that we need to have informa-
tion. And when government is helpful
in creating the initial science that
then goes over to the private sector,
that then goes to creating blockbuster
drugs, then we should know, kind of,
the skin in the game, Mr. Chairman,
and how much that is due to good Fed-
eral policy by not just legislators, but
also our agencies that help push that
research by NIH or the CDC or the Na-
tional Cancer Institute.
Had this bill been brought and the
three prescription drug transparency
lower cost options been brought to the
floor, as I said before—and I am not
going to restate this every amendment
debate—but we probably would have
had a voice vote and we could have
gone out for dinner. But it is attached
to the ObamaCare rescue mission,
which we think the public has already
rejected.
So we will get through this process,
but I would encourage my colleague to
join with the chairman of the com-
mittee and Republicans in looking at
what we can do on this provision in the
future.
Mr. Chair, I would ask my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

tleman from California (Mr.

AMENDMENT NO. 6 OFFERED BY MR. HARDER OF
CALIFORNIA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 6 printed in
House Report 116–61.
Mr. HARDER of California. Mr.
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:

care treatment.’’; and
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from California (Mr. HARDER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. HARDER of California. Mr.
Chair, I rise today in support of my
amendment to the Strengthening
Health Care and Lowering Prescription
Drug Costs Act.
Families in my district, in the Cali-
fornia Central Valley, need prescrip-
tion drugs to go down in cost now, and
they need access to care for every con-
dition, including mental health and
treatment for substance use disorders.
That is exactly what my amendment
is going to help with. The navigators
that help folks understand healthcare
through the exchanges are great, but
they need additional tools to make
sure folks struggling with opioid addic-
tion get the coverage that they need.
My amendment gives them just that.
In most communities I visit, I hear
from someone who has been touched by
the opioid epidemic, and I am no excep-
tion. When I was in high school, I had
a friend who was in a tough family sit-
uation, so I drove him to school every
day for 2 years. He was one of the best
golfers I ever met, had an amazing
sense of humor. But, after graduating,
he developed an addiction to opiates,
and about 5 years ago we lost him to an
overdose.
Stories like my friend’s are far too
common. About 130 Americans die
every single day from opiate overdose.
Folks with substance use disorder de-
serve access to care just like everyone
else, and every person in this country
deserves prescription drugs that they
can actually afford.
It is for my friend and for our loved
ones all across the country who have
struggled with this that I urge my col-
leagues to vote for this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I would re-
serve the balance of my time unless my
colleague yielded back.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has the only time remaining.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Again, I appreciate my colleague
coming down to the floor, especially
when, in his opening statement, he
says he wants drug costs to go down
now.
It is not going to happen now because
it is in a package that is not going to
be accepted by the Senate and the
President is not going to sign.
So, if we really want drug prices to
go down now, we would have done what
we did out of the full committee. We
would have packaged this up with H.R.
965, the CREATES Act, which is a bi-
partisan agreement that is part of this
bill, which would penalize branded
drugmakers that withhold samples
from generic manufacturers.
We would have brought to the floor,
either separately or in a package, H.R.
1499, the Protecting Consumer Access
to Generic Drugs Act, bipartisan out of
the committee. This would ban pay-for-
delay agreements, which are a problem.
And we would have brought up H.R.
938, the Bringing Low-cost Options and
Competition while Keeping Incentives
for New Generics, which is called the
BLOCKING Act, which would limit the
first-approved generic maker’s ability
to stall another rival’s launch.
I think we all want to get there. I
think we will get there. We still are
going to go through this process. But,
make no mistake, this is not going to
be signed into law that we can go down
to the White House for a ceremony.
Again, I would encourage my col-
leagues to work with the chairman of
the Energy and Commerce Committee,
my good friend FRANK PALLONE, and we
can address this amendment and other
processes and hopefully bring the bi-
partisan bill to the floor that would ad-
dress a lot of other colleagues’ con-
cerns and really work on a bipartisan
agreement that, then, by that bipar-
tisan approach, the Senate would have
to really look at seriously, and, hope-
fully, we would convince the President
to sign the bill.
I am just a simple man from south-
ern Illinois, taught high school civics:
two Chambers, President has got to
sign the bill. Sometimes when we use
all this time, it is for other purposes
than really trying to have a bill be-
come law.
So, with that, I would ask my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. HARDER).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. HARDER of California. Mr.
Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from California will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 7 OFFERED BY MS. SHALALA

Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Add at the end of title II the following new
section:
SEC. 205. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO THE
PRACTICE OF SILVER LOADING.
It is the sense of Congress that the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services should
not take any action to prohibit or otherwise
restrict the practice commonly known as
‘‘silver loading’’ (as described in the rule en-
titled ‘‘Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Pay-
ment Parameters for 2020’’ published on
April 25, 2019 (84 Fed. Reg. 17533)).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. SHALALA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, this amendment expresses
a sense of Congress that the Secretary
of Health and Human Services should
not do anything that prohibits State
insurance commissioners from allow-
ing for so-called silver loading.
Let me walk you through how we got
to this point because, while silver load-
ing has worked to keep costs on the ex-
changes lower for people who get sub-
sidies, it has only been used because
the administration was actively trying
to kill the Affordable Care Act.
In 2017, the administration decided to
stop reimbursing health insurance
companies for what are called cost-
sharing reductions, CSRs. CSRs are
payments that health insurance com-
panies are required to make to help
low- and moderate-income people af-
ford healthcare.
Under the Affordable Care Act,
health insurance companies must help
people have more affordable and, pos-
sibly, no copays or deductibles. The
Federal Government was supposed to
reimburse insurance providers for mak-
ing these payments. However, in Octo-
ber of 2017, the administration stopped
making these payments. This was a de-
liberate attempt to make health insur-
ance on the exchange unaffordable and
to undermine, weaken, and attack the
Affordable Care Act.
b 1530
In response to this, the States, bipar-
tisan States, including my own, let in-
surance plans do what is now called
‘‘silver loading.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3880 May 16, 2019
State insurance regulators, in a des-
perate and a very creative attempt to
stabilize the insurance markets, al-
lowed insurance companies to build the
unpaid CSR costs into their silver
plans on the exchange.
This was not the solution anyone
wanted, but it is a solution that has
worked and has created some stability
and predictability in the insurance
markets in the face of an administra-
tion that seeks chaos.
Because the tax credits are
benchmarked to the silver plans, silver
loading has meant that most who re-
ceive subsidies did not see an increase
in their health insurance premiums. In
fact, new data shows that 2.6 million
exchange consumers are now paying
lower premiums as a result of silver
loading.
States that allowed for silver loading
as a way to cope with the manufac-
tured chaos that the administration
tried to inflict on the market actually
saw an increase in enrollment in the
exchange.
The administration has to stop try-
ing to sabotage the Affordable Care
Act. My amendment expresses that it
is the sense of Congress that the Sec-
retary of HHS shall not do anything to
prohibit the use of silver loading to
stabilize the health insurance market-
places.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, obvi-
ously, I rise in opposition to this, and
I understand my colleague from Flor-
ida’s great expertise in this area and
served in the previous administration.
But when you have to subsidize a
plan—there are a couple of problems.
First of all, before ObamaCare came
into being, or the Affordable Care
Act—I am not trying to be disrespect-
ful—insurance was regulated by States.
The new law yanked that away from
States to the point where they created
a system of mandatory coverage that
was unaffordable.
So then part of the plan was, well, we
need to subsidize these plans because,
actuarially, they are not going to work
without government intervention.
Now, the Court case on this, we
thought—and actually, I guess the
Court case is still pending. Can the
Federal Government force someone to
buy something they don’t want to buy?
And we probably will hear another rul-
ing on that. Initially, they said, yeah.
The real debate shifted to: Does the
Federal Government have the power to
tax, versus do you have the power to
force someone to buy something they
don’t want to buy?
So the Supreme Court, in that ruling,
said, since the Federal Government has
the power to tax, this is really a tax;
then, yeah, we can do this.
So then we had the rollout. And the
rollout, I think, in the public’s eye, as
a whole—first, due to the delay because
of the computer system, the network
couldn’t manage it. And then, just the
cost.
As I said before, premiums way too
high; deductibles too high; people
forced to buy an insurance product
that they could not use.
People would go in and say, oh, I got
coverage. Okay. But your coverage is
you still got to pay the first $10,000 in
deductible. And people say, what? That
is not very good insurance.
Well, that is what we created in this
national healthcare delivery system.
The public rendered judgment, as
they do, through the political process.
Republicans came back into control.
Now, what we are trying to do is re-
turn to federalism. We have returned
to States’ regulation of insurance; pro-
vide more options to consumers. That
is what is occurring now, so the higher
cost or the costs are going down. In
fact, I think there was a projection
that 30 percent—there was 30 percent
increases until this last cycle, when
there was a 3 percent increase. Why?
Well, because, under the law, there
are 1332 waivers which allow States to
present another package; and you see
our citizens, our constituents, voting
with their feet to go to these State-
based plans. That is a good thing.
So we are trying—we don’t want to
turn the clock back again. So that is
why I would ask my colleagues to vote
‘‘no’’ on the gentlewoman’s amend-
ment. Although brought well-inten-
tioned and lovingly, I know.
Mr. Chairman, I reject that. I ask for
a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-

Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
It is fitting that H.R. 987, a bill that
would protect the progress of the Af-
fordable Care Act, should include lan-
guage that would reinforce the Federal
navigator program, which provides out-
reach, education and enrollment assist-
ance to consumers looking to buy
health insurance.
This administration has slashed
funding for Federal marketplace navi-
gators in recent years, with some
States facing cuts near 96 percent, un-
dermining the exchanges and hindering
the ability of consumers to choose the
insurance plan that works best for
them.
My background in education makes
it hard for me to understand why we
would ever want to eliminate tools to
help educate the public about how to
access healthcare. It is even harder for
me to understand why we would want
to limit this critical funding just to
States that operate within the Federal
marketplace.
Residents in States like California,
New York, Minnesota, and Connecticut
deserve to have the same opportunity
as people throughout the rest of the
country to learn about their healthcare
options, to learn how to sign up for
coverage, and to learn how this cov-
erage will work.
And so my amendment would open
navigator funds to State-run market-
places, so that my home State of Con-
necticut, and the 11 other States that
operate a State-based exchange, could
benefit from this funding.
The Affordable Care Act helped more
than 20 million Americans sign up for
health insurance. People of color expe-
rienced some of the largest gains in
coverage under the Affordable Care
Act, finally reducing longstanding ra-
cial disparities.
But in recent years, my own State’s
exchange, Access Health CT Exchange,
experienced a marked decrease in en-
rollment with communities of color; a
worrisome sign that the progress that
has been made in healthcare coverage
with the passage of the Affordable Care
Act may be slipping through our fin-
gers.
Cutting funding to the navigator and
outreach programs represents under-
handed attacks on the people that need
healthcare the most. It is part of this
administration’s subtle strategy to roll
back the protections of the Affordable
Care Act by reducing healthcare access
as a last-ditch effort.
The simple fact is that brokers do
not always serve these communities.
There is an urgent need to reinforce
and expand outreach programs to make
sure that we are reaching people in all
zip codes, of all demographics.
State-based exchanges are already
doing their part to be flexible, to invest

in outreach, and to partner with all
communities. Access Health CT even
expanded their open enrollment period
this year after the Texas v. United
States decision was unveiled in Decem-
ber. The exchange knew that it had to
combat misinformation—that the Af-
fordable Care Act was still intact, de-
spite the Texas decision—and that peo-
ple could still sign up for coverage.
State-based exchanges need all the
help they can get to support these ef-
forts.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Chairman, how
much time do I have?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
has 2 minutes remaining.
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Chair, I want to
point out that an estimated 90 million
Americans still have low health lit-
eracy. These people are disproportion-
ately lower-income Americans, elderly
Americans, and Americans with low
English proficiency.
There is a clear need and urgency for
the Federal Government to help these
people in States that operate State-
based exchanges, and there is precedent
for my amendment. My State exchange
has received roughly $3 million for the
In-Person Assister program from the
Federal Government.
The bottom line is that the rules of
the road have changed since changing
the requirement to provide healthcare
coverage to all Americans. There has
never been a greater need to shore up
programs that make certain working
Americans, especially underserved pop-
ulations, are protected and insured;
that people in all communities know
what their options are and know when
and how to access these benefits.
I strongly support H.R. 987. I think
that my amendment will make it even
better.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my
time to the gentleman from New Jer-
sey (Mr. PALLONE), the leader of this
important bill.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I just
think that the navigator program is so
important, and all the outreach that
we have in these bills is very impor-
tant. I obviously support the gentle-
woman’s amendment because every ef-
fort to reach out and educate people
about their options in the marketplace
is so important.
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
So let’s talk about the navigator pro-
gram. They enroll less than 1 percent
today, less than 1 percent.
Wall Street Journal reported an in-
vestigation that one grantee took in
$200,000 to enroll a grand total of 1 per-
son; and they found the top 10 most ex-
pensive navigators collected 2.77 mil-
lion taxpayer dollars, 2.77, Mr. Chair-
man.
Do you know how many people they
signed up? 314.
They want to add $25 million more on
top of the $62,500,000 in grants. We are
talking about less than 1 percent.
Meanwhile, while they are talking
about oh, we have got to educate peo-
ple about all their options, then they
put a gag rule in here that says, can’t
talk to you about short-term duration
plans. Oh, no, we can’t educate about
that choice. No, you can’t know about
that. No, we are going to stop that. Oh,
and you can’t know about association
health plan options either. It might be
better for you and your family and ac-
tually be more affordable. No, no, no,
because that is not our Federal deci-
sion here. They decide, and they don’t
want you to even know. So navigators
can’t talk about those things. That is
gagged in this law.
The amazing thing we never hear
about is the good work of the Trump
administration and the economy as it
has taken off. And I say that in the
context that we have seen the lowest
unemployment rates for virtually
every American and group of Ameri-
cans; whether it is African Americans,
Hispanic Americans, you name it, we
are seeing, the lowest rates, in some
cases, since they began keeping track
of unemployment.
So the economy is doing really well.
Over 3 percent GDP growth the first
quarter.
So what has that meant for insur-
ance?
We have heard the constant, unre-
lenting attacks; you might as well use
impeachment here at some point prob-
ably today.
Look, the number of Americans in
employer health coverage has in-
creased by more than 2.5 million since
President Trump took office. Two-and-
one-half million more Americans
aren’t having to get their healthcare
through the government and tax-
payers. They are getting it through a
job and their employer.
In fact, today, there is a greater per-
centage of Americans in employer
health coverage since Trump took of-
fice than any time since 2000, any time
since 2000.
See, there is another way to provide
healthcare and that is through a job.
Now, I know those who support a full
Federal takeover of everybody’s health
insurance don’t like to hear that be-
cause, see, they don’t think that em-
ployers should offer health insurance.
They think only the government
knows best. And so their Medicare for
All plan, which would cause great
delays in access to care, drive up costs,
you would pay more; but it would take
away your health insurance. If you get
it from your employer, or if you get it
from your union, or if you are a senior
on Medicare and you have a Medicare
advantage policy, that goes away too.
Veterans with TRICARE? Democrats’
Medicare for All program, that is gone,
too.

It is kind of ironic to talk about how
wonderful the Affordable Care Act is
working for Americans, who, by the
way, tell me: ‘‘Look, I am getting
stuck with the highest deductibles and
premiums I have ever seen. I can’t af-
ford it.’’
We had an example from Grand Is-
land, Nebraska, last week. A 60-year-
old couple makes $70,000 a year. They
were paying $38,000 in premiums and
$11,000 in deductibles.
That is affordable insurance? I don’t
think so.
That is why we think States should
have the ability to experiment and reg-
ulate plans at the State level, as they
did under ObamaCare.
All that talk about junk plans and
all that, by the way, those were ap-
proved under ObamaCare. Those were
allowed under ObamaCare. Trump just
allowed them to be there longer. But
because he changed something, there is
this automatic partisan response.
I think we all ought to come together
here. I have fought my entire legisla-
tive career in Oregon and here to make
healthcare more affordable.
The underlying drug bills, there is no
light between us, none, between Repub-
licans and Democrats. Those bills came
out of committee unanimously.
The only reason we are having this
fight on the floor today is because
somewhere along the way, the political
operatives, Mr. Chairman, decided to
bolt these two unrelated sets of bills
together. They knew it would be kind
of a poison pill and kind of fun to
watch Republicans squirm on the floor.
That is why we are here.
The ObamaCare bills we are voting
on today just dump more money into
programs that investigations have
shown are filled with fraud and abuse.
How can you justify putting another
$25 million into a program where the
top 10 most expensive navigators col-
lected $2.77 million and signed up a
grand total of 314 people? Who in their
right mind in private business, Mr.
Chairman, would make that kind of in-
vestment?
The Las Vegas Review-Journal said,
after reading that, ‘‘The navigator
scheme is a make-work government
jobs program rife with corruption and
highly susceptible to scam artists.’’
Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. I
yield back the balance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

At the end of title I of the Rules Com-
mittee Print, add the following:
Subtitle D—Pharmacy School Outreach
SEC. 131. PHARMACY SCHOOL OUTREACH.
The Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices and the Secretary of Education shall
make every effort necessary to ensure appro-
priate outreach to institutions of higher edu-
cation to ensure that students and faculty at
schools of pharmacy are provided with mate-
rials regarding generic drugs and biosimilar
biological products, including materials on—
(1) how generic drugs and biosimilar bio-
logical products are equivalent or similar to
brand-name drugs;
(2) the approval process at the Food and
Drug Administration for generic drugs and
biosimilar biological products;
(3) how to make consumers aware of the
availability of generic drugs and biosimilar
biological products;
(4) requirements for substituting generic
drugs and biosimliar biological products in
place of corresponding drugs products; and
(5) the impacts of generic drugs and bio-
similar biological products on consumer
costs.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentlewoman
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Georgia.
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I am so proud to be voting
today to stabilize healthcare for mil-
lions of Americans and to bring down
the cost of prescription drugs.
I came to Congress, like many of my
fellow colleagues, to protect healthcare
for my constituents with preexisting
conditions and to make healthcare
more affordable and accessible. I my-
self have a preexisting condition, hav-
ing suffered breast cancer twice.
My amendment today is focused on
ensuring that our future pharmacists
and those in the workforce are pro-
vided with materials regarding generic
drugs and biosimilar biological prod-
ucts. Specifically, it would have the
Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices and the Secretary of Education
make every effort necessary to ensure
appropriate outreach to institutions of
higher education to ensure that stu-
dents and faculty at schools of phar-
macy are provided with appropriate
materials.
This will allow for students and fac-
ulty to have material on how generic
drugs and biosimilar biological prod-
ucts are equivalent or like brand-name
drugs, the impact of these products on
consumer costs, requirements for sub-
stituting these types of drugs with cor-
responding drug products, the impacts
of these products on consumer costs,
and more.
Pharmacists spend a great deal of
time with individuals when they come
to the counter to fill an order. They
provide guidance and educate patients
on the prescriptions that they are tak-
ing. I have even met with my own local
pharmacists many, many times to dis-
cuss my own prescriptions.
They are very intelligent individuals
who are relied on by their community
daily. By instilling them with the in-
formation that they need to know to
best help those whom they serve, we
will all be better off.
Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to
support this amendment and the under-
lying package.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self as much time as I might consume.
Mr. Chair, I would like to say that,
as a two-time breast cancer survivor
myself, I have relied many, many times
on the specific information and guid-
ance that has been given to me by my
own pharmacist.
Our pharmacists should be allowed to
be able to give resource information to
help the patients that they serve. By
tying their hands and not being able to
give them the information that they
need to really best serve their patients,
we do them a great disservice.
I truly believe that this information
is very relevant. Giving pharmacists
the ability they need to do their jobs is
of great importance.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER),
America’s only pharmacist in the U.S.
House of Representatives and a distin-
guished gentleman from the Energy
and Commerce Committee.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
thank the ranking member for yielding
and for the opportunity to speak on
this bill.
Mr. Chair, first of all, let me begin by
thanking the gentlewoman from Geor-
gia for proposing this amendment. Al-
though I do find it unnecessary in a lot
of ways, I have to admit that I applaud
her, because educating our healthcare
professionals and, therefore, educating
the public about what is available is
extremely important.
I do have to tell you that I feel the
pharmacy schools already do a good job
of this, and this might be somewhat re-
dundant. However, the underlying
point is that more education is better
even if it is overkill, if you will.
Now, you ask me how I can say that.
I have to say that I have to be con-
sistent, and I have been consistent
throughout that we need to educate
the public.
In fact, if we look back at the debate
that we have had in the committee
when we have been talking about the
short-term plans, I made the point that
we need to educate the public as to
what is available. They need to know.
Therefore, I would be inconsistent if
I didn’t agree with the lady that more
education is better, because I have to
tell you that these short-term plans—I
believe that the other side refers to
them as the junk plans. I have always
said, if they are junk plans now, then
they were junk plans during the Obama
administration, because they were
being offered then.
But those short-term plans, we need
to let people know about them. That is
why I made an amendment in the com-
mittee to educate the public about the
availability of these plans. Unfortu-
nately, my colleagues on the other side
of the aisle disagreed with that, feeling
that, no, they don’t need to know
about it.
Here we have an opportunity to let
people know more, and I have to admit
that I would be in favor of that. I
thank the gentlewoman for offering
this amendment. Where I might be a
little bit ambivalent toward which way
to go, I have to admit that consistency
is important. Short-term plans, we
need to let people know about them. I
fought for that. So I don’t think I
would be consistent if I went against
this.
I thank the gentlewoman for offering
this.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the com-
ments of my friend from Georgia, a dis-
tinguished member of the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
We really have come to rely upon Mr.
CARTER for his guidance, especially on
areas related to pharmacies and trying
to get the costs of prescription drugs
down for consumers. We are all about
that.
We worked together in the last Con-
gress to empower the FDA to get more
generics to market sooner so we have
more competition. That was a bipar-
tisan bill.
That is the way we operated in the
last Congress, Mr. Chairman, as Repub-
licans and Democrats. I led the com-
mittee, and we revamped everything at
the FDA in generics, on medical device
approvals, and on pharmaceuticals so
we could benefit the patient first.
We brought those bills to the floor
unanimously. We didn’t mess around
with them and package them up with
poison pills. We said: Let’s go legislate,
and let’s get this done. And they did.
They got done. They got into law,
signed by President Trump.
And guess what? Last year, the FDA
approved more generics in one year
than at any time in its history. So we
did do things, led by Republicans in the
House, the Republican leader of the
Senate, and President Trump, joining
with Democrats, just as we have at-
tempted to do on the drug bills before
us today.
We are in full agreement. Stop the
bad behaviors, get competition into the
market, and bring down costs of drugs.
But we also believe we should make
sure Americans have choices that are

more affordable when it comes to their
insurance.
Democrats voted for ObamaCare.
They blocked every amendment we had
as Republicans at the time that was
legislated. Remember, the former
Speaker, now Speaker again, said you
have to pass it so you can find out
what is in it. It is kind of an odd way
to legislate, but, anyway, here we are.
By the way, the short-term plans
they call junk plans on that side, Mr.
Chairman, those short-term plans are
the same ones we are debating today,
except all President Trump did is say
you can have them a little longer, be-
cause guess what? For some people, it
is the only affordable health insurance
they have access to in their States.
They are regulated by the States.
They are not unregulated. States can
do all kinds of things. We should em-
power them to do things to make in-
surance more affordable.
Unlike my friends on the other side,
Mr. Chairman, they want to gag the
navigators so they can’t even tell them
about alternatives that may actually
benefit them and be more affordable.
The plans that the other side of the
aisle is railing against today, Mr.
Chairman, are plans that are very
much like the ones that were approved
under President Obama and
ObamaCare. It is just that President
Trump said you can have them for
longer if they work for you. But the
States can come in and say, no, no.
My State says just 3 months. That is
it. Boom. Other States say 30 days.
Some States say none at all.
Mr. Chairman, I am not going to op-
pose this amendment, and I yield back
the balance of my time.

Each such report shall include a summary,
including information on a State-by-State
basis where available, of—
(1) the open enrollment data reported
under subsection (a) for the entirety of the
enrollment period; and
(2) activities related to patient navigators
described in section 1311(i) of the Patient

tives described in subparagraph (A)—
(i) whether such objectives assess the full
scope of patient navigator responsibilities,
including general education, plan selection,
and determination of eligibility for tax cred-

advertising platforms, including television
and radio advertisements and digital media,
to raise consumer awareness of open enroll-
ment;
(2) the division of spending on individual
outreach platforms, including email and text
messages, to raise consumer awareness of
open enrollment; and
(3) whether the Secretary conducted tar-
geted outreach to specific demographic
groups and geographic areas.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentlewoman
from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania.
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of
an amendment to require greater ac-
countability from the Department of
Health and Human Services with re-
spect to the Affordable Care Act.
Time and time again, we have seen
Republicans and the administration at-
tempt to undermine the important
work of the Affordable Care Act.
In addition to attempting to strip
away protections for preexisting condi-
tions or reducing coverage for Medicaid
recipients, the administration is trying
to depress coverage by cutting con-
sumer outreach and marketing for the
ACA. Not only does sabotaging the en-
rollment process make it harder for the
American people to get health cov-
erage, but it also drives up costs.
Unfortunately, this strategy has been
working. We are currently at our high-
est uninsured rate in 4 years, with Af-
fordable Care Act enrollment rates de-
clining every year this President has
been in office.
Everyday Americans, like the folks
in my district in southeastern Pennsyl-
vania, can’t afford more barriers to
healthcare. When their choice is often
between putting food on their table or
going to the doctor, it is important
that people have more information and
access to the Affordable Care Act mar-
ketplaces, not less.
My amendment would require greater
transparency from the administration
by requiring the Secretary of Health
and Human Services to provide vital
statistics on plan enrollment, out-
reach, and advertising, and the overall
performance of the programs within
the ACA.
This information will allow Congress
to perform better, quicker oversight on
Health and Human Services’ attempts
to roll back information and outreach
for potential Affordable Care Act en-
rollees.
No longer will the administration be
able to hide its lack of investment in
ACA outreach and education or refuse
to turn over data on how its say-noth-
ing sabotage is hurting Americans.
Mr. Chair, I encourage Members on
both sides of the aisle to support this
commonsense amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3884 May 16, 2019
will put it in the RECORD that there are
27 of our States, Mr. Chairman—27—
that have decided that short-term
plans are good for their people to be
able to take advantage of. There are
States from Alaska to Wyoming, from
Kansas to Iowa, to Idaho and Pennsyl-
vania where you can go up to 364 days.
Now, there are 12 other States that
have said, you know: We want to limit
these to 6 months. That includes places
like Colorado and Arizona and Nevada
and Oklahoma, North Dakota.
Then there are eight States, Mr.
Chairman, that said: No, we want 3
months. We think that is all we need in
places like Oregon, Hawaii, or New
Mexico.
Then there are four States—Cali-
fornia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and
New York—that said: No, we are just
not going to allow any of these options
in our State.
Guess what. That is federalism. They
get that right.
Now, I know my friends on the other
side of the aisle would like to take
away that ability for these short-term
duration, State-regulated plans and re-
move options from consumers, and I
don’t think that is the way to go. It is
an honest disagreement here that we
have, Mr. Chairman, between the par-
ties.
I have seen a lot of innovation come
out of my home State of Oregon. I was
meeting with one of our former Gov-
ernors, John Kitzhaber, this morning,
talking about the effect of the coordi-
nated care organizations, and they
have been able to actually bend the
cost curve and improve access to deliv-
ery of care by having the flexibility, in
some cases through waivers, to bring
providers together, match them up
with patients, and deliver care more ef-
ficiently and more effectively and with
better outcomes. That should be what
we are debating today: How do we get
to better outcomes?
We should also be debating how we
get healthcare costs down, Mr. Chair-
man. We are doing a bit of that with
the drug bills.
It is unfortunate. It didn’t have to be
this way that they got made into par-
tisan issues, because there is no par-
tisan divide on those bills. It is the fact
that, you know, bailing out some of
these programs in ObamaCare that are
so expensive.
When it costs $2.40 per enrollee for
agents and brokers to assist in enroll-
ment and $767 if you spent $62.5 million
in grants and they enrolled 81,000 indi-
viduals, it averages out, just a rough
average, to over $700, why would we
pour more money into the navigators
that cost 700 bucks and then say: Oh,
by the way, these agents and brokers
can’t do anything to keep them out of
this?
The Trump administration actually
expanded the authority for the agents
and brokers to be involved, leveraging
that private-sector help, and do you
know what? They support 3,660,000
health plan enrollments. That is 42 per-
cent of the plan enrollments in 2018 on
the Federal platform exchanges—42
percent. Mr. Chairman, navigators do 1
percent. And my friends on the other
side of the aisle want to keep dumping
more and more money into the navi-
gator program that, as I pointed out
earlier, we found all kinds of wasteful
spending in.
So there is really an issue about
spending. We know the results. We
know there is a much better way to do
this.
So, Mr. Chairman, I am not going to
oppose this particular amendment. It is
fine, and more information is better
than less.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.

The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 11 OFFERED BY MR. MORELLE
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 11 printed
in House Report 116–61.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 47, after line 18, insert the following:
(b) STUDY ON EFFECTS OF FUNDING CUTS.—
Not later than 1 year after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States shall study the ef-
fects of funding cuts made for plan year 2019
with respect to the navigator program (as
described in section 1311(i) of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (42
U.S.C. 18031(i))) and other education and out-
reach activities carried out with respect to
Exchanges established by the Secretary of
Health and Human Services pursuant to sec-
tion 1321(c) of such Act. Such study shall de-
scribe the following:
(1) How such funding cuts negatively im-
pacted the ability of entities under such pro-
gram to conduct outreach activities and ful-
fill duties required under such section 1311(i).
(2) The overall effect on—
(A) the number of individuals enrolled in
health insurance coverage offered in the in-
dividual market for plan year 2019; and
(B) the costs of health insurance coverage
offered in the individual market.
Page 47, line 19, strike ‘‘(B)’’ and insert
‘‘(C)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from New York (Mr. MORELLE) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to offer an amendment intended
to detail the full harm done to our Na-
tion by the White House’s sabotage of
the Affordable Care Act.
Last summer, the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services announced
a 70 percent cut, $26 million to the
navigators program that provides in-
person assistance to people who wish to
sign up for insurance through the Af-
fordable Care Act. In just 2 years, fund-
ing for this program has plummeted
from $62.5 million to just $10 million.
The President also cut digital TV and
radio advertising by 90 percent, reduc-
ing investment from $100,000,000 to $10
million. The failure to use Federal
funding for these activities leaves it to
the States to fill in the gaps and puts
on them the burden for the continued
success of State and Federal ex-
changes.
My amendment directs the U.S. Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to con-
duct a study of these cuts to detail how
reduced funding has harmed enroll-
ment across the Nation and the result-
ing costs to our Nation’s families.
Funding for ACA outreach is essen-
tial to ensuring that Americans know
their options and their healthcare ben-
efits. Without public messaging cam-
paigns, many people have been left
confused about the open enrollment
process, when they can begin signing
up for coverage, and the deadline for
enrolling before the new year.
As we approach planning for the 2020
enrollment season, we need to fully un-
derstand the results of the cuts to out-
reach and advertising that were put in
place in recent years. That is what my
amendment seeks to do.
I want to thank my colleague Con-
gresswoman WEXTON for joining me in
these efforts, and I ask my colleagues
to support this amendment.
I thank the chair and the ranking
member for their work, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
time in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Chairman, I
yield the remainder of my time to the
gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.
WEXTON), my colleague.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the Representative for offering this
amendment and for yielding.
This amendment requests a GAO re-
port on how funding cuts to the navi-
gator program and to Affordable Care
Act marketing and outreach have im-
pacted health insurance enrollment
and the cost of coverage on the indi-
vidual markets.
Navigator programs provide critical
assistance to consumers by raising
awareness about the availability of
marketplace plans, assisting people as
they apply for Federal subsidies, and
providing impartial information about
different marketplace plans. Impor-
tantly, these programs help otherwise
hard-to-reach groups get health insur-
ance coverage, including people living
in rural and underserved communities.
The Trump administration has made
significant funding cuts to the navi-
gator program, however, providing
only $10 million in funding for the pro-
gram for 2019, an 80 percent reduction
over the past 2 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3885
May 16, 2019
Navigator funding in my home State
of Virginia has been reduced by an as-
tounding 76 percent between 2016 and
2018, down from approximately $2.2 mil-
lion in 2016 to just $525,000 in 2018. To
manage these cuts, programs have had
to lay off staff, close offices, and limit
their availability to help consumers.
The administration’s cuts hamper
navigators’ ability to do their jobs,
leaving many consumers on their own
during the enrollment process, and, as
a result, people may not obtain cov-
erage on the individual market, caus-
ing people who do get coverage to see
their premiums increase.
Constituents in my district and peo-
ple throughout the U.S. rely on naviga-
tors to learn about coverage options
and to enroll in the best possible
healthcare plans for them. We need to
know how the administration’s drastic
funding cuts have impacted the indi-
vidual markets, and this amendment
will allow us to do that.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Chairman, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, it is in-
teresting; the prior amendment that
passed added $25 million more to this
navigator program. For the plan year
2017, navigators received a total of $62.5
million in grants and yet only enrolled
81,426 individuals. That is less than 1
percent of the total enrollees.
You see, the issue here isn’t whether
we should or shouldn’t enroll more peo-
ple. The issue is who is most efficient
with the taxpayer or private-sector
dollar to do that.
We keep pouring more and more
money into this navigator program and
we know there is all this, well, I guess
I am going to call it waste. I don’t
know if it is fraud.
But holy smokes, as I have said be-
fore, one grantee, according to The
Wall Street Journal, took in $200,000
and enrolled one person—one person.
You want to have a Government Ac-
countability Office report and inves-
tigation, let’s look at the underlying
program and how in the heck that
could happen.
And then they also found the top 10
expensive navigators collected $2.77
million and signed up 314.
These aren’t my numbers. These are
The Wall Street Journal investigative
reporters. You know, in the press,
these are facts, which caused the Las
Vegas Review-Journal to editorialize
that: ‘‘The navigator scheme is a
make-work government jobs program
rife with corruption and highly suscep-
tible to scam artists. It’s a slush fund
for progressive constituent groups.’’
Not my words, that is the press. I
have a journalism degree. I have a
great respect for the press and what
they write. I don’t always agree with
them.
But, look, when you take these inde-
pendent reviews and you look at what
is happening there, CMS reported that
17 of those navigators enrolled fewer
than 100 people at an average cost of
$5,000 per enrollee—$5,000. $5,000. And
my friends on the other side of the
aisle want to shovel more money into
that program. I think that is the
height of fiscal irresponsibility.
See, for $2.7 million, if we put that
into community health centers, Mr.
Chairman, do you know how many peo-
ple we could cover? We could take care
of 20,000 patients, according to one esti-
mate—20,000.
Health centers are really, really im-
portant to me and my constituents. We
have 63 different places in my district,
which is bigger than eight States east
of the Mississippi, Mr. Chairman,
where people get their healthcare in
our communities. We have to reauthor-
ize this year, by the end of September,
our community health centers.
Now, when I was chairman, we did
that at a record level because they de-
liver record good healthcare. We have
had no plan yet to figure out how to
pay for that, but you are going dump
$25 million more into this navigator
program. Why don’t we put it into ac-
tual healthcare?
We reauthorized the Children’s
Health Insurance Program under Re-
publicans and fully funded it for a dec-
ade. The longest that had ever been
done was 5 years, and, unfortunately,
most of my friends on the other side of
the aisle voted repeatedly against
doing that for a whole host of reasons,
but they voted ‘‘no.’’ In Oregon, we
have 122,700 children and expectant
moms that rely on CHIP, SCHIP, part-
nership with the State for their health
insurance.
So there are a lot of things we can in-
vest in with the proceeds from the sav-
ings from the drug bills, but investing
in the navigator program? $5,000 per
enrollee?
There are 100 navigators, that is all
they did? One for 200,000, enrolled one
person? I mean, come on. There has got
to be a better way to not spend the tax-
payers’ money than that.
And so I think you look at the in-
credible growth in men and women
working in America, getting better
paying jobs, bigger paychecks and
healthcare, 2.5 million since President
Trump took office, and Republicans
put progrowth policies into the Tax
Code, progrowth regulatory policies
into the bureaucracy.
Jobs are coming up. The biggest issue
I run into with employers now is not
overregulation; it is: Where do I find
more people to work?
So we need to look at job training.
We need to work at available work-
force. But this, this amendment, I
think, is, frankly, from my perspec-
tive—with all due respect, GAO doesn’t
need to waste their time on this nor
the taxpayer’s money, and especially
after $25 million more was just signed
up in addition to—what?—$63 million,
roughly, an enormous amount of
money into a program that I think has
a lot of problems. And the editorial
writers at the Review-Journal said,
‘‘highly susceptible to scam artists,’’
‘‘slush fund for progressive constituent
groups.’’ So I oppose the amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Subtitle D—Reports
SEC. 131. EFFECTS OF INCREASES IN PRESCRIP-
TION DRUG PRICE.
Not later than 1 year after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Secretary of Health
and Human Services shall submit a report to
the Congress on the extent to which in-
creases in prescription drug prices may have
caused Medicare beneficiaries to forego rec-
ommended treatment, including failing to
fill prescriptions.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. WATERS) and a

Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment requires the Department of
Health and Human Services to submit
to Congress a report on the extent to
which increases on prescription drug
prices may have caused Medicare bene-
ficiaries to forego recommended treat-
ment, including failing to fill their pre-
scriptions.
Drug prices have increased signifi-
cantly over the past year. The Center
for American Progress reported that
nearly 30 drug companies announced
last year that price increases will take
effect in January.
Pfizer alone announced that it would
raise the prices of 41 different drugs.
Critical medications, including insulin
and opioid addiction treatments, have
already seen dramatic price increases
this year.
These price increases are taking a
toll on patients. The Kaiser Family
Foundation reported that among those
currently taking prescription drugs, 24
percent of adults and 23 percent of sen-
iors say it is difficult to afford their
prescription drugs. This includes about
one in ten respondents who say it is
very difficult.
The Kaiser Family Foundation also
found that certain groups are much
more likely to report difficulty afford-
ing medication, including those who
are spending $100 or more a month on
their prescriptions, that is 58 percent;
those who report being in fair or poor
health, about 49 percent; those who
take four or more prescription drugs,
35 percent; and those with incomes less

than $40,000 per year, representing 35
percent.
Furthermore, 29 percent of all adults
report not taking their medicines as
prescribed at some point in the past
year because of the cost, and 8 percent
say their condition got worse as a re-
sult of not taking their prescriptions
as recommended.
Needless to say, when Medicare bene-
ficiaries cannot afford their medica-
tions, their health will suffer.
My amendment requires HHS to
study the impact of increases in pre-
scription drug prices on Medicare bene-
ficiaries and their health.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support my amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
time in opposition to the amendment,
but I am not necessarily opposed to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Oregon is rec-

There was no objection.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-

Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, we
have had extensive discussions
throughout this Congress about the
plight of those who cannot afford pre-
scription drugs.
We know what the statistics are. We
know the harm that is being caused to
families, and we know that there are
preventable deaths if, in fact, people
could afford their prescription drugs.
And so I would expect all of the Mem-
bers of the House of Representatives,
knowing this information, under-
standing all of the research that has
been done, the data that has been col-
lected, to simply support this amend-
ment in order to save lives.

ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise today to support this
amendment. The amendment requires
navigators to receive training on how
to assist consumers with Medicaid and
CHIP enrollment.
This amendment has also been scored
by the Congressional Budget Office to
have no effect on direct spending or
revenue.
The health insurance navigator’s pro-
gram was created by the Affordable
Care Act to assist individuals with se-
lecting and enrolling in health insur-
ance coverage plans.
They were intended to carry out pub-
lic education activities, provide infor-
mation to prospective enrollees about
insurance options and Federal assist-
ance, and examine enrollees’ eligibility
for other Federal or State healthcare
programs.
Fundamentally, their responsibility
was to help people make the best
healthcare decisions for themselves
and their families.
Unfortunately, this essential pro-
gram has been targeted in recent years,
among others. The administration has
slashed the open enrollment period in
half, slashed funding for consumer out-
reach and enrollment education activi-
ties by 90 percent, and slashed funding
for navigators by 84 percent.
Because of this intentional sabotage,
enrollment in the Federal marketplace
has dropped each year under this Presi-
dency.
In my home State of Texas, we are,
unfortunately, deeply familiar with the
consequences of the lack of health in-
surance.
Texas has the highest rate of unin-
sured people in the Nation, with 4.7
million people lacking coverage and
adequate access to healthcare.
As representatives of Americans from
all corners of the country, we have a
responsibility to ensure that our con-
stituents and communities are knowl-
edgeable and can access the health in-
surance best suited for their individual
health needs.
By voting in favor of this amend-
ment, Congress will ensure that navi-
gators are fully equipped and informed
to assist our families and children with
their potential options within the Med-
icaid and CHIP programs.
I appreciate my colleagues on the
Committee on Energy and Commerce
and their partnership in expanding
training requirements for navigators,
and in the Strengthening Healthcare
and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs
Act.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
time in opposition to the gentle-
woman’s amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair-
man, I have no further statements, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentlewoman for her amendment.
I find it a bit interesting, though,
that under the navigator program, on
the one hand, my friends on the other
side of the aisle say, Look, you can’t
talk about—in fact, you can’t tell any-
body about association health plans
and those as options.
You can’t educate the public, the
consumers about an opportunity to
save money by having a state-regu-
lated plan. No, not under the navi-
gator. You can’t do that.
And yet, with this amendment, they
want to expand that knowledge, so
they can get training on the other gov-
ernment plans, Medicaid and CHIP en-
rollment. And that is not necessarily a
bad thing. I am not saying that is a bad
thing.
But what I am saying is, why
wouldn’t we want full education? Why
would we want, basically, a gag order
here that prevents the navigators from
telling the consumers, Here are some
other options you may want to look at.
Now, they have limitations; they are
regulated by your State; you need to be
fully informed—in fact, really in-
formed, because some of them don’t
cover everything—as we have heard—
because that was how it was designed
under President Obama’s plan, that
there would be these options and they
wouldn’t be the fully covering plans,
but they were okay because they would
fill a gap.
And those are the same plans we
have heard a lot about today that
States regulate. And I would go back
to the fact that in some States it is 3
months.
Well, in 27 States they go up to al-
most 1 year, including States such as
Rhode Island and Tennessee, even
Texas, Virginia, Georgia and Idaho.
In 12 States, they go up to 6 months.
In eight States, including mine, we
said—in Oregon—just 3 months, that is
all we are going to do in short-term du-
ration plans.
California, Massachusetts, New York,
New Jersey, said no. Zero. We are not
going to allow them.
That is okay. That is federalism.
But why, in the navigator program,
would we say, You can’t talk about
things.
I got a degree in journalism a long
time ago at the University of Oregon,
and I believe in the facts. And I believe
marketplaces and consumers are better
served when they have complete infor-
mation to make choices.
And I know that these insurance
products are on the market. Some are
fine, people like them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3887
May 16, 2019
And I get these letters—I got one
from Tom in Medford—that talked
about how his premium, I think, went
from 400-and-some dollars to $800 in 1
year. And he is not sure what he is
going to do. That was in October when
the new numbers came out.
And meanwhile, when we put all this
reliance on these navigators. We know
from the Wall Street Journal, one
grantee took $200,000, enrolled one per-
son.
I guess, if you are the grantee, that is
a pretty good deal. All you have to do
is find one person to enroll, and you
get 200 grand. To me, that sounds like
a big waste of taxpayer dollars.
The ten most expensive navigators
collected $2.77 million, signed up 314
people.
Now, we heard about how the govern-
ment needs to borrow and spend more
than taxpayer dollars—or at least
spend more taxpayer dollars—and do
more education because the enrollment
in the government plans has gone down
by, I think, the figure is about $1 mil-
lion or so. I guess, that is what is ban-
died about.
What isn’t mentioned, however, Mr.
Chairman, is that under President
Trump and the policies Republicans
put into law, the economy took off.
The economy took off. Thank goodness
the economy took off.
And 2.5 million Americans now get
their insurance, more get their insur-
ance through an employer.
So, see, they got a job, they got a
paycheck, they got insurance through
their employer.
And my guess is that accounts for
some of that downturn. They don’t
have to come to the government to get
their insurance. They are getting it
through their employer.
So you might have had like $1 mil-
lion roll off on the exchanges, but you
have got a 2.5 million pickup in the pri-
vate insurance side. And I think that is
pretty cool. I mean, that is important.
And I know that my friends on the
other side of the aisle with their na-
tional takeover of health insurance
want to abolish ObamaCare and replace
it with a single-payer system, which
sounds sort of simple on its face, but
we know that means you would have to
double the personal income tax, double
the corporate tax, and our doctors and
hospitals, they would have to take like
a 40-percent reduction.
Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. BURGESS), my friend, the
doctor, the former chairman of the
Health Subcommittee, to make some
comments.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing.
The fact is, there was a hearing on
this one-size-fits-all government take-
over, top-down, Soviet-style healthcare
system that has been proposed by the
other side of the aisle.
And yet, that bill was not heard in
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. It wasn’t heard in the Ways and
Means Committee. It was heard in the
Rules Committee, the Speaker’s com-
mittee.
This is a high priority for the Speak-
er. This bill was heard in the Speaker’s
committee. That tells me that this is
something that is highly likely to
come forward. Unfortunately, it is just
not a very good plan.
And the gentleman is right, doctors
would be required to take a significant
reduction.

gentleman from Oregon has expired.

AMENDMENT NO. 14 OFFERED BY MR. LYNCH
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order

in House Report 116–61.
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I believe
I have a couple of amendments at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 42, beginning on line 6, strike ‘‘De-
cember 31, 2022’’ and insert ‘‘December 31,
2023’’.
Page 43, line 6, strike ‘‘January 1, 2024’’

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Massachusetts.
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment would extend by 1 year the
deadline by which States may apply for
Federal grant assistance to set up
State-based health insurance markets,
moving the deadline from December 31,
2022, to December 31, 2023.
b 1630
My amendment would also extend by
1 year the corresponding date by which
the exchanges must be self-sustaining,
from January 1, 2024, to January 1,
2025.
Currently, 11 States and the District
of Columbia have such health insur-
ance exchanges. However, no health ex-
changes have been established since
the ACA’s original deadline of 2015.
While I do support H.R. 987’s lan-
guage which provides an additional 2-
year window for States to establish
their own insurance exchanges, given
the complexity of the current debate
with the possibility of single-payer
healthcare out there and also Medicare
for All, it is my hope and expectation
that, by extending these application
periods from 2 to 3 years, more States
will have the opportunity to weigh
those outstanding options and explore
the option to establish their own
State-based exchanges.
It was reported recently that the
Governor of New Jersey, for example,
has announced that his State would
seek to establish its own State-based
healthcare exchange for 2021. It is quite
possible that other States that may
have held off in setting up similar ex-
change marketplaces and are contem-
plating those other possibilities could
also be reconsidering setting up an ex-
change, and that is the reason for my
amendment. I believe that ensuring
that States have the time to consider
and plan for setting up such an ex-
change is the right thing to do.
I would note that my amendment
does not seek additional funding during
that time period, so it will not increase
the cost. It simply gives States addi-
tional time.
I urge my colleagues to support my
amendment as well as the underlying
bill, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
time in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I reserve

Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chair, I think I have
said enough. It is a technical amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, this
section provides $200 million for States
to establish State-based marketplaces.
The Federal law provided States with
the option of building their own State-
based marketplace or utilizing the Fed-
eral marketplace.
I know my own State blew through
close to $300 million trying to create
its own exchange. It was a terrible fi-
nancial disaster, a total waste of
money. They couldn’t get it going.
They finally closed the thing up, but
not before they blew through hundreds
of millions of dollars, and then they
went to the Federal exchange.
Every State except Alaska applied
for these grants. Florida and Georgia
were awarded planning grants but later
returned their entire grants. Other
States returned some of the grant
money they received but also kept
some.
This would have been under the
Obama administration when they were
enacting ObamaCare. No funding was
awarded after December 31, 2014, in ac-
cordance with the law.
From the 2018 plan year, 34 States
had federally facilitated marketplaces;
12 States had State-based market-
places; and 5 States had State-based
marketplaces using the Federal plat-
form.
The Committee on Energy and Com-
merce issued a majority staff report
entitled: Implementing ObamaCare Re-
view of CMS’ Management of the
State-Based Exchanges, September 13,
2016.
I think it is important to share with
my colleagues, among the report’s key
findings in 2016 were: CMS was not con-
fident that the remaining State-based
exchanges would be sustainable in the

long term, and as of September 2016,
every State-based exchange still relies
upon Federal establishment grant
funds 20 months after the State-based
exchanges were supposed to be self-sus-
taining by law.
CMS eased the transition for these
failed State-based exchanges so that
they could join healthcare.gov by al-
lowing them to keep the user fees col-
lected by insurance carriers intended
to pay for the use of healthcare.gov.
Now, here we are, 5 years after the
funding has expired considering a bill
to reopen grants for States to establish
State-based marketplaces. We have
seen kind of a spotty record here.
Maybe it is just a coincidence that $200
million is being made available now,
because my friends on the other side
set the agenda and they want to con-
tinue pushing out this idea.
On Friday, Politico reported that
New Jersey is proposing to create a
State-based health exchange. Now, I
think they have told us they actually
don’t need Federal money for that.
But anyway, I don’t think we are
dealing with earmarks here; but ear-
marking money to help States create
their own marketplaces is not what we
should be about, and I am not sure we
are. I don’t think this is a Garden
State giveaway, but it is kind of inter-
esting.
That is all I have got to say on this,
Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

AMENDMENT NO. 15 OFFERED BY MR. LYNCH
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 15 printed
in House Report 116–61.
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I have
another amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 50, after line 2, insert the following
section:
SEC. 205. GAO REPORT.
Not later than one year after the date of
the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller
General of the United States shall submit to
Congress a study that analyzes the costs and
benefits of the establishment of State-ad-
ministered health insurance plans to be of-
fered in the insurance market of such States
that choose to administer and offer such a
plan.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Massachusetts.
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, my amendment di-
rects the Government Accountability
Office to prepare a cost-benefit anal-
ysis of the establishment of a State-
sponsored public health insurance op-
tion for States that may want to offer
public options in their State’s health
insurance exchanges.
A State-run public option would
allow individual States to offer very
basic, low-cost insurance plans without
the high cost of commercial adver-
tising and other overhead costs that
can sometimes add as much as 30 per-
cent to the cost of some health insur-
ance plans, or perhaps States could op-
timize the use of community health
centers that we all love so much. Once
these low-cost public option plans are
on the market, private insurance com-
panies would be forced to compete with
that lower price by offering similar
low-cost plans.
State-sponsored public options could
help address the lack of competition
that is driving up the cost of
healthcare in many States where one
or two insurance companies are al-
lowed to dominate the market due to
the fact that the Affordable Care Act
currently exempts insurance compa-
nies from antitrust laws.
While State-run public options were
a feature in the original version, the
House version of the ACA, which I sup-
ported, Senate action deleted that from
the final versions of the ACA which
eventually passed and which I opposed.
I believe that the information that
the study will provide will be an impor-
tant resource for States in regions
looking to offer more healthcare op-
tions to their residents.
Mr. Chairman, one of the loudest
messages that came out of the last
mid-term election was that, 9 years
after the passage of the ACA, the
American people still want us to fix
their broken healthcare system.
For many people, the Affordable Care
Act is not affordable. But I believe it is
fixable. Many fervent supporters of the
ACA are also disappointed with the
lack of success in reaching the goals of
the ACA so that they are now sup-
porting efforts to repeal the ACA in
favor of single-payer or Medicare for
All proposals.
I believe there are some significant
changes that could be made to the ACA
to make it work. This study will be a
simple way to provide our States with
guidance that can help them determine
whether a public option may be right
for them.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support both this amendment and
the underlying bill, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
time in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
This amendment is pretty straight-
forward in asking the GAO to do this
evaluation, and I think it is important
to have cost-benefit analyses of State-
administered health insurance plans
for States that may want to offer a
public option.
Again, here we have a situation
where States are experimenting, and
our States are great laboratories for
reform. The gentleman comes from a
State where Republican Governors
helped lead that effort, Governor Rom-
ney and others, and now Senator ROM-
NEY from a different State.
But my State did a lot of reform
work as well, and we are all trying to
figure out: How do we get healthcare to
people in a timely way that is afford-
able? And we share that goal.
Unfortunately, some of the promise
of ObamaCare turned out not to be the
case. People’s insurance premiums did
not go down $2,500. I still hear in my
town meetings and in correspondence
with my constituents that some were
well-served, but I have a lot of them
who were left behind, and they are out
in the cold.
At one of my townhalls, I had a mid-
dle age couple come up and say: We
have decided we can’t afford health in-
surance, so we have decided to go with-
out.
They looked at the premiums. They
looked at the deductibles that are in
these markets, and said: We can’t pen-
cil it out.
None of us want that to be the case.
That is why I think some of these op-
tions are really important to look at.
And States can do that.
And that is what President Trump
tried to do is take what President
Obama had agreed to with the short-
term plans regulated by States to fill
gaps to make health insurance options
more available and health insurance
more affordable. He just said: Well, if it
is good for 3 months, what is wrong
with 364 days.
So as a result, you have got 27 States
that go up to nearly a year; 12 are 6
months; 8 at 3 months; and 4 say, no,
not in our State at all. So I think the
report is probably going to give us
some valuable information.
Mr. Chairman, I guess I have actually
convinced myself I am going to support
this amendment despite my initial res-
ervations, and I yield back the balance
of my time.

SEC. 205. REPORT ON THE EFFECTS OF WEBSITE
MAINTENANCE DURING OPEN EN-
ROLLMENT.
Not later than 1 year after the date of the
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States shall submit to
Congress a report examining whether the De-
partment of Health and Human Services has
been conducting maintenance on the website
commonly referred to as ‘‘Healthcare.gov’’
during annual open enrollment periods (as
described in section 1311(c)(6)(B) of the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42
U.S.C. 18031(c)(6)(B)) in such a manner so as
to minimize any disruption to the use of
such website resulting from such mainte-
nance.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, American families in-
creasingly struggle with rising
healthcare costs. That is why I am
pleased to support the underlying bill
which contains some commonsense
provisions that will protect consumers,
lower drug prices, and stabilize the in-
dividual insurance market, which will
provide families with some needed re-
lief.
The amendment I am offering will
further help Americans who purchased
health insurance on healthcare.gov.
Americans in 39 States without a
State-based exchange depend on
healthcare.gov to purchase insurance
during open enrollment. This past
year, over 8.4 million plan selections
were made on this website.
Over the past 2 years, the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services
had announced maintenance outages
on healthcare.gov for over 12 hours
every Sunday during open enrollment.
I am an engineer. I understand the
complexity of this website and the
heavy volume of users, which means
that routine maintenance is necessary,
even during open enrollment. However,
I want to ensure that HHS is doing all
it can to ensure this maintenance is
conducted in a way that has the least
impact on consumers.
Families need ample time to choose
health insurance plans. We must make
sure that enrollment is not being nega-
tively impacted by these outages. My
amendment would require a GAO study
to determine if healthcare.gov outages
are having a negative impact on enroll-
ment.
HHS claims that maintenance is
scheduled for times of low site traffic,
but they have not provided data to sup-
port this claim. I know that when I am
using the online exchange to purchase
my insurance each year, I often will
try to do it on a Sunday when I have
free time. This may be an anomaly. We
need to figure this out.
What the GAO study would provide is
clarity on the best time to schedule
maintenance. This would help us to
make sure HHS is doing right by Amer-
icans as they navigate the complex
process of buying health insurance.
Mr. Chairman, this is a simple, com-
monsense amendment. I urge a ‘‘yes’’
vote on this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, it
should come as no surprise that I seek
time in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
I think this is a commonsense
amendment. I ask GAO to look at the
study and say: Okay. What is the best
time to take healthcare.gov offline to
do maintenance?
Let’s do this the right way. As an en-
gineer, that is the way I think. I think
most companies would look at it this
way.
So I urge my colleagues to support
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for bringing his amend-
ment as well. He is a distinguished
Member of our U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and an engineer, and we
appreciate his intellectual horsepower
on this issue.
I was thinking, as he was talking
about having the GAO have to do an
audit to figure out the best time for
routine maintenance to provide the
least disruption to consumers, this is
what happens when you have a govern-
ment-run system. You have to have
your independent auditors figure out
how the system can keep current and
not disrupt consumers.
I was thinking that we don’t have too
many amendments that say let’s have
GAO audit Amazon’s website to find
out the best times to deal with con-
sumers or your local whatever you go
to for your hotels or your rental cars.
Nobody is saying, hey, you have to
have GAO, a government entity, figure
out the best time or worst time to dis-
rupt consumers on the Avis website or
Enterprise or whatever. But we have to
here, which is a government-run sys-
tem with basically one website.
We all know and we all lived through
what happened with the initial rollout
with this website, so, Mr. Chairman, to
my friend from Illinois’ point, it is im-
portant that we give the consumers the
best possible experience when they are
trying to sign up because we have all
had to deal with it.
In its initial days, man, it was a
mess. I remember all those problems.
We did hearings and oversight hearings
in the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee on it.
Mr. Chairman, this is probably a
good idea to do, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection
to the request of the gentleman from
Florida?
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the right to object.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized on his res-
ervation.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I know
there were a lot of amendments that
came through the system. I am trying
to figure out what the issue is here, but
I know we offered 16 amendments and
got one. The Democrats got 25 amend-
ments and had one technical amend-
ment through the Rules Committee.
Could the Parliamentarian or some-
body explain what the problem is here
and why we have to correct it here on
the floor?
That is my question.
Mr. DEUTCH. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
to the gentleman from Florida.
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, the
amendment is a technical amendment
to address a drafting error so that it is
conforming and so there will be no
problems going forward.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I withdraw
my reservation.
The Acting CHAIR. The reservation
is withdrawn.
Without objection, the reading of the
modification is dispensed with.
There was no objection.
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection
to the original request of the gen-
tleman from Florida?
There was no objection.
The Acting CHAIR. The amendment
is modified.
The gentleman from Florida is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I thank my Florida colleague, Rep-
resentative CASTOR, for her leadership
in protecting access to high-quality
healthcare in our State and across the
country and for her authorship of the
ENROLL Act to help more Americans
shop for and sign up for health plans on
healthcare.gov.
My amendment requires navigators
to provide information in plain lan-
guage about the 10 essential health
benefits that are a part of every
healthcare.gov plan: outpatient hos-
pital care; emergency care; hospitaliza-
tion; pregnancy, maternity, and new-
born care; mental health and substance
use disorder services; prescription
medicines; rehabilitative services; labs;
preventive care; and pediatric care, in-
cluding dental and vision services.
It also requires navigators to help
consumers understand their protec-
tions under the Mental Health Parity
Act. According to a survey commis-
sioned by the American Psychological
Association, only 4 percent of Ameri-
cans were familiar with the mental
health parity law as of 2014, and just 7
percent were aware of mental health
parity more broadly. Those numbers
didn’t change from the time of passage
of the Affordable Care Act in 2010
through the first years of enrollment
in 2014.
Mental health parity means insur-
ance companies can’t discriminate
against Americans battling addiction
in the opioid crisis. Parity means in-
surance companies can’t make it hard-
er to get care for deadly eating dis-
orders than it is to get care for deadly
cancer. Parity means we treat mental
healthcare like healthcare because
that is exactly what it is.
The Affordable Care Act’s protec-
tions have saved lives and the financial
security of millions of Americans, in-
cluding one family who told me the
story of their battle to treat their 19-
year-old daughter’s eating disorder.
Here is what they said:
Our daughter was a sophomore in college
when she was diagnosed with an eating dis-
order. She had to take several leaves of ab-
sence from her studies to seek treatment.
This would not have been financially pos-
sible without the benefits of the ACA. Had
she left school for treatment before the pas-
sage of the ACA, she would have been
dropped from our family insurance. But be-
cause of the ACA, she could continue under
our coverage.
It was this ongoing treatment that has al-
lowed our daughter to regain her health
enough to graduate from college and main-
tain full-time employment.
While it is clear that parity has made
improvements, we still have so much
more to do.
This week, I heard from another fam-
ily in my district about their daugh-
ter’s struggle to get coverage and
treatment. In the cycle of denials and
arbitrarily reduced levels of care, her
family was able to use the parity law
to fight for their daughter’s life in the
courts.
But that is not enough. Parity pro-
tections have opened doors to better
mental health and addiction treatment
for so many Americans. As we observe
Mental Health Awareness Month, it is
important to acknowledge how far we
have to go.
My amendment will help more Amer-
icans understand the benefits and pro-
tections available to them and help
them get the care they need.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support it, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, this is
an important amendment so that every
American understands that mental
health is health and that we need to
care as much about the health of our
bodies from our shoulders up as we do
from our shoulders down. That is what
people need to be made aware of so
they have the ability to fight for that
access to mental healthcare.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I ap-
preciate the gentleman’s commitment,
especially on mental health and sub-
stance abuse. He has done a lot of work
in this area.
I know, Mr. Chairman, when we in
the last Congress worked together in a
bipartisan way, we passed 60 different
bills related to the deadly scourge of
opioid addiction and overdose. The
prior Congress to that I believe is when
we rewrote America’s mental health
laws for the first time in decades.
We all have friends, family, and peo-
ple in our communities who need help,
especially with mental health and, as
we know, substance use disorder. We
did a lot of good work, I would say. We
have to make sure, to the gentleman’s
point, that the efforts we have put for-
ward, the programs we have initiated,
and the funding we put behind these
programs actually get to the people
who need the help.
Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. BURGESS), who was chair-
man of our subcommittee when we
were in the majority and now is the top
Republican of the Health Sub-
committee, to talk a little bit about
these issues.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I think the kindest
thing I can say about this amendment
is it should not be necessary.
Just a brief review of the history of
mental health parity as it relates to
our healthcare system, of course, those
of us who were here in Congress the
day after the Lehman Brothers bank-
ruptcy was declared in September 2008
will recall that Patrick Kennedy’s bill
dealing with mental health parity was
used as the vehicle to provide the Trou-
bled Asset Relief Program, which fol-
lowed in the wake of the Lehman
Brothers bankruptcy.
So mental health parity was actually
written into law in 2008, signed by
George W. Bush. That was 2 years prior
to the passage of the Affordable Care
Act.
So the Affordable Care Act comes
along. The essential health benefits
were eventually disclosed in the Af-
fordable Care Act in November 2012,
about a week after election day, if I re-
call correctly.
The mental health parity rules were
not written by the Department of
Health and Human Services until prob-
ably 2 years after that, but they were
written under Secretary Sebelius. As a
consequence, those have been the rules
of the road ever since.
I guess what I don’t quite understand
is why the navigator system con-
structed under the Affordable Care Act
was not constructed in a way that
would have allowed this information to
be part of the package of information
that is disclosed by the navigators.
Perhaps had we had a hearing in the
Energy and Commerce Committee
dealing with this, it might have been
instructive when we did the 10-year re-
authorization of the State Children’s

May 16, 2019
Health Insurance Program a little over
a year ago. The parity language was, in
fact, included at the request of a Demo-
cratic member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. The parity language
was included in the rewriting of the re-
authorization of the State Children’s
Health Insurance Program.
But my recollection was, in the navi-
gator program, this should have been
part of the basic information offered by
the navigators.
I guess, to sum up, I do not under-
stand why it would now take an act of
Congress to get them to do what they
were required to do upon the signing of
the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I would
just conclude that I appreciate the gen-
tleman’s comments.
As I look at a bunch of amendments
coming up, to my colleague from Texas
(Mr. BURGESS), there are a whole bunch
of these that they are saying, oh, we
have to order the navigators do this, do
this, and do that.
You wonder what their current train-
ing is that we have to pass laws telling
them to learn about these things and
then go talk to people.
This is part of my argument that we
are pumping a lot of money into a pro-
gram that we know there has been—I
don’t know if I can say fraud, but if
you got $200,000 to enroll one person or
$2.7 million to enroll 314, some of the
Nation’s leading editorial writers have
had some pretty strong words to say
about corruption and scam artists and
that sort of thing.
We are having to pass laws that tell
them, oh, by the way, talk about men-
tal health, talk about substance abuse,
talk about referrals to community-
based organizations, the navigator sys-
tem, vulnerable populations, all these
things. Holy smokes, what don’t they
know and what is left out?
We should have a hearing on this
issue in the committee as well as the
Medicare for All proposal.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LYNCH). The
question is on the amendment, as
modified, offered by the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH).
The amendment, as modified, was
agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 18 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF
MARYLAND
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 18 printed
in House Report 116–61.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 48, line 21, strike the period and in-
sert ‘‘and shall be provided to populations re-
siding in high health disparity areas (as de-
fined in subparagraph (E)) served by the Ex-
change, in addition to other populations
served by the Exchange.’’.
Page 49, line 18, strike the end quotes and
the second period and insert the following:
‘‘(E) HIGH HEALTH DISPARITY AREA DE-
FINED.—For purposes of subparagraph (A),
the term ‘high health disparity area’ means
a contiguous geographic area that—
‘‘(i) is located in one census tract or ZIP
code;
‘‘(ii) has measurable and documented ra-
cial, ethnic, or geographic health disparities;
‘‘(iii) has a low-income population, as dem-
onstrated by—
‘‘(I) average income below 138 percent of
the Federal poverty line; or
‘‘(II) a rate of participation in the special
supplemental nutrition program under sec-
tion 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42
U.S.C. 1786) that is higher than the national
average rate of participation in such pro-
gram;
‘‘(iv) has poor health outcomes, as dem-
onstrated by—
‘‘(I) lower life expectancy than the na-
tional average; or
‘‘(II) a higher percentage of instances of
low birth weight than the national average;
and
‘‘(v) is part of a Metropolitan Statistical
Area identified by the Office of Management
and Budget.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself 31⁄2 minutes.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my
amendment and the underlying legisla-
tive effort that would lower the cost of
prescription drugs, crack down on junk
insurance plans being encouraged by
the Trump administration, and reverse
the administration’s irresponsible sab-
otage of the Affordable Care Act.
Specifically, my amendment would
require the HHS Secretary to conduct
educational outreach to communities
with high health disparities and would
thereby expand outreach efforts to in-
crease coverage among African Ameri-
cans, Latinos, Native Americans, low-
income families, and rural commu-
nities.
Our effort to help more Americans
get access to affordable healthcare
comes just as we are seeing the impact
of the Trump administration’s effort to
undermine our healthcare system.
This week, we learned that more
than 1 million Americans lost their
health insurance in the past year, and
the number of Americans in high-de-
ductible plans reached an all-time
high.
Black and Latino Americans and
families living at or near the poverty
line are particularly impacted by
President Trump’s sabotage. These
communities are the most at risk of
being uninsured, and these commu-
nities have always faced the greatest
barriers to obtaining care and have re-
ported the poorest health outcomes.
b 1700
Before the Trump administration, we
saw large gains in coverage for low-in-
come individuals and people of color
under the Affordable Care Act.
Finally having that health insurance
made a key difference in determining
when people got care, where they got
their care, and, ultimately, how
healthy they could be. However, this
progress has been rapidly reversed over
the last 2 years.
My amendment would ensure that we
aren’t leaving behind those with pre-
dictably poor health outcomes, like
those with lower life expectancy or
children born with lower birthweight.
Families in high-disparity areas suf-
fer from low levels of healthcare, lit-
eracy, language barriers, and limited
awareness of the Affordable Care Act’s
coverage options.
In this uncertain environment, in our
complicated healthcare system, in this
constant fight for access to healthcare
in this country, knowledge is half the
battle.
I strongly encourage my colleagues
to support this amendment. Help all
Americans attain the knowledge they
need and win their healthcare battles.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
the time in opposition to the gentle-
man’s amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI).
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise today in support of amend-
ment No. 18 to H.R. 987.
I want to thank Congressman BROWN
for his partnership on this amendment,
which will ensure that we conduct
thorough outreach to inform con-
sumers in areas with high health dis-
parities about their insurance options.
The underlying legislation restores
assistance to help Americans enroll in
affordable, high-quality health insur-
ance, and this amendment makes sure
those efforts include a particular focus
on low-income areas most in need not
only of health insurance, but also of
improved health outcomes.
In addition to reversing the Trump
administration’s sabotage of the Af-
fordable Care Act, this bill is a huge
step forward in our efforts to lower the
cost of prescription drugs.
For families in my district and
across the country, the high cost of
prescription drugs is more than a
health issue; it is an economic issue.
Increasing competition and improving
access to safe, lower cost generics can
save American families thousands of
dollars each year at the pharmacy
counter.
Mr. Chair, working families are
counting on this body to help strength-
en access to high-quality health insur-
ance. For this reason, Mr. Chair, I urge
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair,
may I inquire as to how much time is
remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland has 11⁄2 minutes remain-
ing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3892 May 16, 2019
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair,
I yield such time as she may consume
to the gentlewoman from California
(Ms. BARRAGÁN).
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Mr. Chair, I am
proud to join my colleague, Congress-
man BROWN, in cosponsoring his
amendment, implementing outreach
and educational activities in areas
with high health disparities.
I know about this all too well. I rep-
resent one of these districts, a district
that is a majority minority. It is 88
percent Latino and African American,
combined. These are the types of dis-
tricts where you have higher health
disparities happening, where Latinos
and African Americans have more dia-
betes than anybody else.
My district also happens to be 357 out
of 435. That is where we land as far as
income of all the congressional dis-
tricts in Congress, where people need
this information. They need the out-
reach so that they know what kind of
access they have to healthcare so that
they have those options.
Providing opportunities to under-
served communities to learn about
their healthcare coverage options will
result in more people signing up for af-
fordable care. More people will get
treated when they become sick, and
more people will be able to live healthy
and productive lives.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, let me
just say a couple of things. One, I rep-
resent a very rural district in Oregon.
It is two-thirds of the landmass of the
State. We suffer a lot of these same
issues: low income, high levels of pov-
erty, and the need for basic services.
Mr. Chairman, that is why I worry a
lot about making sure our community
health centers get funded. I think you
know this. They run out of funding in
just a matter of months. The National
Health Service Corps, same thing. By
the end of September, I think they run
out of money. I have a number of In-
dian reservations. Native Americans.
Their Special Diabetes Program runs
out of money. The teaching health cen-
ters run out of money.
Yes, today we are pouring money
into a program that some of our Na-
tion’s leading editorial writers have
called susceptible to scam artists and
corruption and that spends $2.7 million
to sign up 314 people. That doesn’t
seem like a very good expenditure to
me. I would rather put that money into
our community health centers and into
some of these other proven programs
that work.
I think it is fine to do outreach, cer-
tainly, and to expand education. I do
wish it were more fulsome. I wish there
weren’t a gag restriction on our navi-
gators so that they can’t talk about
other insurance alternatives that our
States have pioneered and regulate,
that even the Obama administration
approved these short-term plans; yet
derided today, these were approved, in
many cases, under the last administra-
tion.
This one said: If they work good for 3
months, let’s see if States want them
for 6 or 9 or pretty close to 12.
That is what the President did.
President Trump, too, if you think
about the economy—all we ever hear
on the other side is kind of all the neg-
ative. It is sort of Debbie Downer day
here.
Actually, the economy is doing really
well, and, as a result, people are get-
ting jobs. When they are getting jobs,
they are getting bigger paychecks.
They are also getting insurance. And
2.5 million people now have insurance
who didn’t have it before, through
their employer, during the Trump ad-
ministration.
I realize they are not going to go
bragging on the Trump administration,
my friends to the left, but I do think it
is important to get the facts out there
because facts matter, and I believe in
facts.
Mr. Chair, 2.5 million more people
now have insurance who didn’t have it
before, and they have it through their
employer. That is the direction we
should go: jobs, income, insurance
through your employer.
Then what we really should focus
on—and I think there is bipartisan sup-
port for this—is how do we get at the
costs for healthcare.
By the way, who knows what any-
thing costs, right? We are paying more
and more out of pocket through our
deductibles and our copays, yet what
does an MRI cost here versus there
versus there?
I was at the White House with the
President on Thursday, Mr. Chair, and
he is going after surprise billing. My
friend from New Jersey and I are joined
on this effort to pass bipartisan legisla-
tion so that the consumer doesn’t get
stuck with a bill because somebody
showed up to care for him at a hospital
that, it turns out, wasn’t in their plan.
They played by the rules, the consumer
did.
We had one example there of a doctor
whose daughter got care and then was
asked to do a urine test because of
some medication. They wanted to do
just a quick test. The doctor said: Hey,
will you do it? She did it on the way
out.
It turned out the lab, I think it was,
was not in the network of her insur-
ance plan. She didn’t know that. She
just followed the doctor’s orders. Do
you know what that bill was? Over
$17,000.
He brought a copy of the bill. I don’t
have it here, but he brought it to the
White House.
And President Trump is full-throat
ready to solve this. Just as he and his
administration—I don’t think we have
ever had a President, not in my life-
time, that has leaned in more to get
prescription drug prices down for con-
sumers.
That is what is going on there in the
real world. And the President and Sec-
retary Azar and the team at CMS, they
are leading on this now.
There are things you might like or
dislike in terms of their proposals, but
we have never had a President and an
administration do more to try and
drive out the unnecessary costs that
consumers are being forced to pay.
That is where they are making the
decision of whether they can afford to
actually take the drugs from the phar-
macist and go home or leave them on
the counter.
So we have got a lot of issues, and
some of them we are going to work out.
I just so regret that we are here today
with these for funding the navigator
program with another $25 million on
top of the 68 so they can spend $2.7 mil-
lion and sign up 314 people. We can do
that much more efficiently. We have
proven that.
CMS says that others can do it for
much less money, much less money.
Not $767 per enrollee, but $2.40. Who
wouldn’t take that deal, $2.40 per en-
rollee or $767?
So I just think there is a better way
to operate. This amendment is fine in
the end, I guess, and so I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN).

Americans to community-based organi-
zations that also address social needs
tied to health outcomes.
Social factors like your ZIP Code, in-
come, race, ethnicity, and language
ability all play a major role in one’s
health. A good example in the commu-
nities I represent is housing and home-
lessness. Without adequate housing, it
is hard to address people’s healthcare
needs.
At a recent roundtable I had with
hospitals, community health centers,
and other medical professionals, they
made clear that homelessness pro-
foundly impacts people’s and their pa-
tients’ health. Hospitals like L.A.
County-USC are looking at homeless-
ness as a health risk factor.
What does that mean? That means,
when you get checked into L.A. Coun-
ty-USC, they not only determine do
you have a family history of pre-
existing conditions like heart disease
and hypertension, have you suffered
from alcoholism, they not only con-
sider that, but now they put on the
board, right above the patient, ‘‘Home-
less.’’
The reason why is that you might be
able to take care of their underlying
healthcare condition, but, if they end
up back on the street days later, then
their health outcomes will be nega-
tively impacted.
So organizations in our communities
that are not necessarily healthcare re-
lated can play a critical role in ad-
dressing healthcare outcomes.
Navigators must understand what
our constituents are facing. They can
meet people where they are and are
well positioned to refer them to organi-
zations that can improve that individ-
ual’s long-term healthcare outcome
and also reduce costs.
We know that the Trump administra-
tion is undermining ObamaCare, and
we need to reverse it with this legisla-
tion. Yet, at the same time, we must
improve health equity to ensure all
Americans have meaningful access to
care. My amendment would do just
that: improve health equity, lower
costs, and help Americans from all
backgrounds get and stay healthy.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I seek the
time in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I will try
and make this fairly quick.
I actually am going to oppose this
amendment for this reason. Here we
are going through trying to say to the
health navigators, in amendment after
amendment: Your job is to enroll peo-
ple in health insurance. That is your
job. And, by the way, we are going to
have to pass a law that tells you to be
sure and include a discussion about
mental health, be sure and include and
get educated on substance use disorder
benefits.
One after another, we are going
through and putting in the statute all
the things that ought to be, A, common
sense and, B, ought to be part of an
overall educational program for the
navigators.
And now recognizing, well, first of
all, they are very expensive; second,
there has been at least some level of
questionable activity in the use of the
taxpayer dollars; and, third, they don’t
know what they are doing, so we have
got to instruct them via statute; now
we are going to say: By the way, go do
all these other things, too, that have
nothing to do directly with enrolling
people in the Affordable Care Act.
So you are going to say, on the one
hand: We don’t think you are getting it
right; we have got to give you more
money. Now we are going to give you
new duties that are kind of loosely de-
scribed, if you ask me, to provide refer-
rals to community-based organizations
and address social needs related to
health outcomes.
That is all going to be in law now?
Really?
I think this whole program, the more
I sit and listen to all the amendments
that need to be put into law to change
it—this was an ObamaCare creation, so
I guess we are—I don’t know. I
wouldn’t say you are sabotaging
ObamaCare with this, but, certainly,
you are changing ObamaCare and the
navigators.
We are looking at the costs, and,
gosh, there is a lot we could do.

I think the gentleman has 40 health
centers in his district. And I assume he
knows that I have got about 63 loca-
tions; and I assume the gentleman
knows the money for those health cen-
ters runs out at the end of the fiscal
year, and we have got to find a way to
pay for that. I would rather put the
money into that than into this pro-
gram.
So, Mr. Chairman, I am going to op-
pose this amendment, and I yield back
the balance of my time.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I guess
this is the second time we have had to
edit amendments on the House floor, if
I understand what is happening.
There were a lot of amendments of-
fered in the Rules Committee. We were
promised by the Democrats at the be-
ginning of this legislative session that
this would be an open House where our
amendments would be considered. I
know 92 percent of the amendments the
Democrats have allowed to come to the
floor have been Democrat amendments.
Imagine that.
We had 16 Republican amendments
on this bill alone. We got one amend-
ment. Democrats got 25, and two of
them we have had to edit here on the
floor. And then we had one that was a
bipartisan, just technical change
amendment.
I sure hope we are not going to see
that for the rest of this Congress under
Democratic control, that we are shut
out of the amendment process.
When Republicans were in charge and
had the Rules Committee, 45 percent,
something like that, of the amend-
ments were minority amendments,
Democrat amendments. We opened the
floor to that, and now it has been shut
down.
Mr. Chairman, I won’t object to this
change. It needs to be done.
Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my objec-
tion.

The Acting CHAIR. The reservation

There was no objection.

There was no objection.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I rise today to offer an amendment to
H.R. 987, the Strengthening Health
Care and Lowering Prescription Drug
Costs Act.
The navigator program is crucial to
communities like El Paso, where we
have one of the highest uninsured rates
in the State of Texas.
Navigators provide free assistance to
my constituents as they maneuver
through the marketplace to find a
healthcare plan that is right for them.
When funded adequately, these pro-
grams help decrease the uninsured pop-
ulation across the country.
However, the Trump administration
has sought to cut funding for the navi-
gator program in its plan to systemati-
cally undermine the Affordable Care
Act.
By slashing the program’s funding by
84 percent over the last 2 years, the
total funds allotted for it now stands
at $10 million.
To exemplify these draconian cuts,
consider this:
In 2017, there were nine navigator
programs funded in Texas and two op-
erating in El Paso County.
In 2018, the number of navigator pro-
grams in Texas dropped to just two,
with only one now operating in El Paso
County. This presents a challenge to
States and districts like mine that
have seen their populations increase
over the past decade.
The Center for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services has coupled these deep
cuts with a rule overturning a require-
ment for navigator programs to train
their assisters to help individuals with
chronic illnesses and limited English
proficiency.
While the Trump administration
claims this will give navigators more
flexibility to tailor their training for
the populations they serve, it is really
another attempt to scale back what
has proven to be a successful program.
By cutting funds and reversing this
requirement, navigator programs will
be forced to choose between extra
training for their assisters or hiring
more of them to cover counties now
lacking operational programs.
Navigator programs that do not pro-
vide proper training could result in
their assisters being underprepared
when a consumer from a vulnerable
population comes to them for assist-
ance. Enrolling in the marketplace can
be complex for anyone, especially for
those whose primary language is not
English.
While H.R. 987 restores funding to the
navigator program, we must ensure
these programs continue to train their
assisters to help underserved popu-
lations.
My amendment does just that by re-
quiring Navigators to provide training
for their assisters to serve vulnerable
populations, including individuals with
chronic illnesses and limited English
proficiency.
In my home county of El Paso, there
are almost 25,000 uninsured individuals
who are not English proficient. This
amendment will ensure navigator pro-
grams are able to help all El Pasoans
find suitable healthcare plans.
Simply put, Mr. Chair, access to af-
fordable healthcare is a right, and my
amendment ensures we make every at-
tempt to leave no one behind.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I thank Representa-
tives TORRES and PORTER for their co-
sponsorship.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
time in opposition to the gentle-
woman’s amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I know
it has been a long day here on the
floor, and we are covering a lot of
ground. We have got a few more
amendments to go.
Again, I think as we go through these
amendments, and the gentlewoman is
spot on, we have got to make sure peo-
ple are trying to help people get access
to insurance; can speak the language,
can assist in each one of our districts.
But it is kind of an indictment to the
existing program, if you think about it,
that you have got to come here and
legislate this. To me, whether it is
about mental health, or substance
abuse, or this, or the one before, this
should be commonsense management
of a program, and it tells me we have
got a problem with the underlying nav-
igator program.
We know that it is very, very expen-
sive. We know that they enroll less
than 1 percent, less than 1 percent. Ev-
erything we are arguing about this
afternoon with all the amendments on
the navigator program, both, are shin-
ing the light on the shortcomings of
the program itself, which I think the
administration has pointed to and said,
This thing isn’t working very well, and
it is at the least very expensive; $767
per enrollee, it appears. In the private
sector they do it for much, much,
much, much less.
So it is not that this amendment is
bad or misguided. I don’t think it is.
But I think, once again, it is like a
bright light on the underlying program
that must be fraught with all kinds of
problems, because we have got 16—no,
wait. We have got 25 amendments from
my friends on the other side of the
aisle, most of which are to tell the nav-
igator how to do a better job and to put
in Federal statute how to, basically
have common sense.
I have never thought, by the way,
you could legislate common sense. I
don’t know what my colleagues think
of that. I never thought you could.
But I do know we need to fund com-
munity health centers, and the Na-
tional Health Service Corps, and spe-
cial diabetes programs, and teaching
hospitals. And we have got this issue of
the—this will be one that will be inter-
esting.
If you don’t want to change
ObamaCare, are you going to let the
Cadillac tax hit insurance plans of
union workers and people working in
business?
Or are you going to put off the big
cuts that are coming right at our hos-
pitals?
I had my hospitals in the other day,
and they are saying, Boy, I sure hope
you are going to turn off those DSH
cuts that are headed our way. We did
that last Congress. I helped lead the ef-
fort on that.
But that is actually called for in the
underlying ObamaCare which, by the
way, a disproportionate share of hos-
pitals are those in our rural areas, in
many cases, have a high portion of
Medicaid, and they were supposed to,
as part of the grand bargain with the
Obama administration and Democrats,
take these cuts. And now they are com-
ing back to us saying, We can’t afford
to take these cuts.
So I don’t know if you will describe
that as sabotaging ObamaCare, but I
will bet you are going to join us in try-
ing to hold off those DSH cuts that are
coming at our community hospitals.
So it just strikes me, again, that this
navigator program must be a mini-dis-
aster in the making if everybody has to
come to the floor with an amendment
to tell them how to do their job, and to
reach out and serve the people this
whole thing was intended to serve.
So it is not that I am opposed to the
amendment. I just think the under-
lying program is pretty darn expensive.
But you have heard me say that before
today, Mr. Chairman, a time or two.
I yield back the balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 21 OFFERED BY MS. WEXTON

to consider amendment No. 21 printed

May 16, 2019
(b) PROHIBITION.—The Secretary
In section 204, insert after the header the
following new subsection:
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) On August 3, 2018, the Administration
issued a final rule entitled ‘‘short-term, lim-
ited-duration insurance’’ (83 Fed. Reg. 38212).
(2) The final rule dramatically expands the
sale and marketing of insurance that—
(A) may discriminate against individuals
living with preexisting health conditions, in-
cluding children with complex medical needs
and disabilities and their families;
(B) lacks important financial protections
provided by the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148), in-
cluding the prohibition of annual and life-
time coverage limits and annual out-of-pock-
et limits, that may increase the cost of
treatment and cause financial hardship to
those requiring medical care, including chil-
dren with complex medical needs and disabil-
ities and their families; and
(C) excludes coverage of essential health
benefits including hospitalization, prescrip-
tion drugs, and other lifesaving care.
(3) The implementation and enforcement of
the final rule weakens critical protections
for up to 130 million Americans living with
preexisting health conditions and may place
a large financial burden on those who enroll
in short-term limited-duration insurance,
which jeopardizes Americans’ access to qual-
ity, affordable health insurance.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentlewoman
from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Virginia.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, my amendment in-
cludes findings about how short-term,
limited-duration insurance weakens
protections for the millions of Ameri-
cans living with preexisting health
conditions, including children with
complex medical needs and disabilities.
Last year, the Trump administration
greatly expanded the sale and mar-
keting of short-term, limited-duration
insurance, also known as junk insur-
ance, plans. And these plans are junk
because they don’t provide critical pro-
tections laid out by the Affordable
Care Act.
As my amendment points out, these
plans lack important financial protec-
tions, may discriminate against indi-
viduals living with preexisting condi-
tions, and may exclude coverage of es-
sential health benefits such as pre-
scription drugs and hospitalization.
The protections afforded by the Af-
fordable Care Act are literally life-
saving for children with complex med-
ical needs and disabilities. These chil-
dren require specialized treatment and
medical care that depends on medica-
tions, therapies, and equipment such as
ventilators, oxygen tanks, feeding
tubes, and specialized wheelchairs. The
ACA’s essential health benefits ensure
plans cover this care and treatment
that these children may need.
Children with complex medical needs
often require extended hospitals stays
with medical care costing into the mil-
lions of dollars. Families who purchase
junk plans and whose children subse-
quently encounter medical difficulties
may soon find that these insurance
plans are effectively worthless, failing
to cover the healthcare their children
need, and terminating their coverage if
it becomes too expensive. These chil-
dren could also be subject to lifetime
coverage caps that they would exceed
before they are old enough even to go
to preschool.
The Trump administration’s actions
don’t only harm families purchasing
junk plans. As more people participate
in these junk plans, the families who
remain in comprehensive ACA-compli-
ant plans would also see the cost of
their insurance premiums increase.
No family should face uncertainty
about whether or not their children
will have access to lifesaving care
when they need it most.
My amendment includes findings
that highlight just how harmful these
junk plans are for the up to 130 million
Americans living with preexisting
health conditions, and how they jeop-
ardize Americans’ access to quality, af-
fordable health insurance.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
time in opposition to the gentle-
woman’s amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
b 1730
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chairman, junk
plans provide inadequate medical cov-
erage and circumvent crucial consumer
protections afforded by the Affordable
Care Act and are harmful to those liv-
ing with preexisting conditions.
We have a responsibility to guar-
antee affordable quality health insur-
ance for every American.
Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues
agree, and I urge them to support this
amendment. I thank my colleagues,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I might consume.
Mr. Chairman, I note that the gentle-
woman’s amendment—and it is a seri-
ous amendment, we appreciate it being
offered. But in her State of Virginia,
the State of Virginia said it is okay to
offer these plans up to 364 days dura-
tion, short-term, limited-duration in-
surance policies. These fill a gap that
are regulated by her State.
These kinds of plans, Mr. Chairman,
were first approved by the Obama ad-
ministration, because they must have
recognized that there would be a need
for a short-term plan to fill a gap here
and there, and obviously a lot of Amer-
icans have taken advantage of those
plans.
Now, because of that, the Trump ad-
ministration said, well, maybe if they
are good for 3 months, we should let
States decide up to a year, and then
they could go up to a couple of years,
I guess. Four states have already said
no way, no how; three have said 8
months, that is as long as you can go;
12 have said that you can go to 6
months; and 27 States, including the
State of Virginia, the Commonwealth
of Virginia, has said 364 days.
Now, look, the important thing here,
and I think we would have to agree on
this if this were the amendment, there
should be full and complete disclosure
of what these plans cover or do not
cover, full and complete, completely
transparent, because the last thing any
of us wants is someone with a pre-
existing condition or some other issue
or complex medical situation, like the
gentlewoman described, from getting a
plan that basically they are told covers
those things when it doesn’t.
Now, it is interesting, I know Dr.
BURGESS is not only a distinguished
member of the Energy and Commerce
Committee, but one of the rare individ-
uals in our body that also serves on the
Rules Committee.
If memory serves me right, Dr. BUR-
GESS, I believe one of our colleagues,
the chair of the Energy and Commerce
Subcommittee on Health, had an
amendment in the Rules Committee
that would require full disclosure and
transparency, right?
Mr. BURGESS. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. WALDEN. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas.
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chair, the gen-
tleman is correct. And, in fact, if the
gentleman will recall, that in our com-
mittee work on these bills dealing with
the Affordable Care Act, the chair-
woman of the Subcommittee on Health
actually had this as a stand-alone bill.
It was not considered when we did
the markup on the other four bills. For
some reason, it fell off the list that
day. I don’t know why. I wasn’t con-
sulted, and I wasn’t advised. But it was
offered as one of the amendments up in
the Rules Committee, again, by a
Democratic member of the Energy and
Commerce Committee, the chairwoman
of the Subcommittee on Health, but
the amendment was not made in order.
And, again, I don’t know why. I was
not part of the discussion of the major-
ity that decided which amendments
were going to come to the floor.
It was perhaps a little surprising, be-
cause a majority of the amendments
that were made in order were Demo-
cratic amendments. And, again, this
was a Democratic amendment.
I think the ranking member of the
full committee and I agree, that this is
precisely the type of situation where
you would want the purchaser to have
complete knowledge of what they were
buying. And the State Commissioner of
Insurance, I know in my State in
Texas, is very clear about that. On the
website of the State of Texas, you need
to know what you are buying.
This would be one of those cases
where that disclosure, in fact, would be
extremely helpful to the family that is

trying to make a decision. Because,
look, why is someone looking at buy-
ing a limited-duration plan? They are
looking at buying a limited-duration
plan because they can’t afford what is
being sold on healthcare.gov or there
perhaps is some temporary situation, a
job transition or something that they
are trying to cover.
The fact of the matter remains that
the child described in the previous dis-
cussion would likely be better covered
in one of the plans sold at
healthcare.gov, but if, for whatever
reason, the family decided that they
wanted to investigate a less expensive
plan and a limited-duration plan, that
is certainly their right to do so. Prob-
ably not the best advice for them to
buy that limited-duration plan, but
certainly they should be free to do so,
but they should also receive the infor-
mation.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, back to the
issue of the gentlewoman’s amend-
ment, the chair of the Subcommittee
on Health, her amendment, the short
summary here says:
Require short-term, limited-duration in-
surance plans to prominently carry a disclo-
sure the plan provides coverage for limited
medical conditions and benefits.
That amendment was not made in
order. It should have been made in
order, because then we could get to the
other question here, which I think we
all agree on, is that there needs to be
complete transparency of these things,
because they don’t cover everything.
We all buy lots of insurance products
for cars, houses, life insurance, dis-
ability, and all these things, and I want
it to be easy to understand, full disclo-
sure.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chair, I demand a
recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from Virginia will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 22 OFFERED BY MR. PAPPAS

designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:

GETS’’ (and update the table of contents ac-
cordingly).

pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary
shall establish annual enrollment targets for
such Exchange for such year.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Hampshire.
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I want to thank my col-
leagues for introducing this legislation
that works to improve our healthcare
system and lower the skyrocketing
costs of prescription drugs. This bill
will bring much needed relief to the
millions of Americans who are strug-
gling to afford the care that they need.
The people from my home State of
New Hampshire know that we must
move beyond a political debate over
the ACA to bipartisan action that will
improve coverage and lower costs.
Just last week, I was proud to vote to
protect Americans with preexisting
conditions and introduce an amend-
ment to safeguard coverage for those
suffering from substance use disorder.
The amendment I am offering today
strengthens this legislation and the
ACA by ensuring the administration is
actively working to expand Americans’
access to care.
Specifically, my amendment requires
the Department of Health and Human
Services to set enrollment targets,
goals that can be tracked and pursued
with smart investments of resources.
This commonsense practice was em-
ployed by the previous administration,
yet the Trump administration has
failed to do so.
While they should be promoting en-
rollment for affordable coverage,
Health and Human Services has slashed
the advertisement and outreach budget
by 90 percent and it cut in-person en-
rollment assistance funding nearly in
half.
These actions have very real con-
sequences. Recent reports indicate that
more than 1.1 million Americans lost
healthcare coverage in 2018.
In my State of New Hampshire, more
than 10,000 individuals lost coverage
over the past 3 years.
These cuts have hindered organiza-
tions such as the Bi-State Primary
Care Association in New Hampshire.
The organization is responsible for
helping nearly 110,000 underserved
Granite Staters navigate the complex-
ities of our healthcare system and find
coverage in the enrollment period,
which lasts only 6 weeks.
In the words of Executive Director
Tess Kuenning:
The loss in funding means a loss of a trust-
ed impartial adviser educating and providing
information so people can make an informed
decision about health insurance coverage.
Without collecting and monitoring
enrollment numbers, it is impossible to
hold the department accountable or
track how they are deploying resources
to support enrollment.
In fact, the nonpartisan GAO
slammed the administration for refus-
ing to set targets and having no way to
evaluate overall performance.
As a small business owner, I can’t
fathom how leaders can work towards
success without clearly defined goals.
How do you measure progress? How do
you know how to best utilize your re-
sources? How do you know if you need
to make a course correction?
The American people deserve to
know their government is working to
expand access to care, not seeking to
limit it.
In the greatest Nation on Earth, no
American should miss the opportunity
to have healthcare, economic security,
quality of life, and the peace of mind
that comes with it.
Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-

Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Chairman, I urge
adoption of this amendment, and I

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, while I appreciate the
gentleman’s amendment, and I am all
about setting targets and holding peo-
ple accountable for their goals, it turns
out the navigators already tried that,
and it didn’t work very well. So I don’t
know that having Secretary Azar set a
goal for each of the exchanges and all
is going to work any better.
Navigators enrolled less than 1 per-
cent of total enrollees. And according
to one report, in fact, the navigator’s
program had an enrollment goal of
2,000, but, well, he kind of fell short. He
only enrolled one person. So that is a
bit of a problem.
I think goals are a good thing, but I
don’t know that that is going to help
here. We know how many people get
enrolled. We know information around
this.
I don’t know. Once again, here we are
trying to micromanage a program that
clearly has a lot of flaws, or we
wouldn’t be putting all these things
into statute.
I mean, I don’t think we are giving
these amendments to 25 Democrats
just because they are freshmen. I think
they have substantive issues they are
trying to bring to the floor here. But it
seems to me that this is really odd to
micromanage a program to this level,
and so I am going to end up opposing
this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman

ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Chair, I
am honored to be here today to intro-
duce my amendment to H.R. 987, the
Strengthening Health Care and Low-
ering Prescription Drug Costs Act.
My amendment promotes trans-
parency and accountability to how the
Trump administration is spending Af-
fordable Care Act, ACA, user fees.
For nearly 2 years now, the Trump
administration and Republicans in
Congress have tried and failed to repeal
the ACA. Had they been successful, 23
million hardworking Americans would
have lost their health insurance and be
left with nothing, no health security
for themselves, their children, or their
families.
When those efforts didn’t pan out,
the Trump administration and our
friends across the aisle turned their at-
tention to sabotaging the ACA, dis-
mantling the law piece by piece.
First on the chopping block, they
shorted the ACA enrollment periods by
over half, from 92 days to 45. Less time
to make a decision means less partici-
pation.
Next up was cutting funding for con-
sumer education and outreach, not just
a small cut, but a reduction of 90 per-
cent from $100 million to just $10 mil-
lion.
The goals are clear: let’s keep public
healthcare options a secret and let’s
make it as difficult as possible to in-
sure yourself and your family.
Funding for vital navigator programs
was slashed by 40 percent. This was a
move the Government Accountability
Office, the GAO, has self-described as
‘‘problematic.’’ But it is much more
than problematic; it is detrimental.
It is clear their goal is and always
has been to drive ACA enrollment down
to zero.
Last year, the administration began
allowing insurance companies to pro-
vide junk insurance plans, plans that,
for one, don’t protect consumers with
preexisting conditions.
Now the administration is pushing
the ACA navigators to promote these
junk plans, advertising these plans as
somehow comparable to qualified ACA
plans that provide full protections.
Obviously, consumers are going to be
confused by this.
The GAO found that the drastic re-
duction in outreach and advertising,
‘‘Likely detracted from the 2018 enroll-
ment.’’
That is not likely. That is a fact.
This is unacceptable, and it works di-
rectly against the intent of the law,
which is to get more people healthcare
coverage.
For some reason, this administration
thinks that having uninsured Ameri-
cans is a good thing.
My Democratic colleagues, the
American public, and I believe dif-
ferently.
In my home State of California, we
saw the value of investing in ACA con-
sumer education outreach. The way to
get people covered and reduce unin-
sured rates is to educate consumers
about their healthcare coverage op-
tions and make sure they know that
healthcare insurance is affordable and
within reach.
Having strong consumer outreach
and enrollment activities can, in fact,
lower premiums. This is exactly what
we found in California.
Our State program covering Cali-
fornia estimates that its outreach ac-
tivities lowered premiums by up to 8
percent for all consumers.
b 1745
This is basic economics. More par-
ticipants equal lower costs for every-
one. That 8 percent reduction amounts
to some $576 million in my State alone.
That, my friends, is a great invest-
ment.
There is a clear intent by this admin-
istration and the Republican Members
to undermine the Affordable Care Act
by drastically reducing vital funding
for a fully functioning marketplace.
And who does that hurt? Everyone.
This administration intends to jam
the spokes on the progress the ACA has
made to increase the number of people
with healthcare coverage. Congress and
the American people deserve answers
to these attempts to subvert the ACA.
First, we need to know what the ad-
ministration has been spending ACA
user fees on if they are not using these
funds for education and outreach. We
need to know why you are still charg-
ing States a 31⁄2 percent user fee to ac-
cess a Federal platform if those fees
aren’t being used for the purposes they
were collected. And, naturally, we need
to know why there was a recent 50 per-
cent increase in user fees for State-
based marketplaces. Talk about a tax
rate hike.
My amendment seeks answers. It re-
quires an annual report to be sub-
mitted to Congress that includes a de-
tailed breakdown on spending for, one,
outreach and enrollment; two, the nav-
igator program; and, three, the mainte-
nance of healthcare.gov and the call
centers.
No one should be denied or dropped
healthcare coverage because they are a
senior, pregnant, or get sick.
Healthcare is a right, not a privilege,
and everyone deserves access to qual-
ity, affordable care. It is critical now,
more than ever, for us to receive an-
swers on how the ACA user fees have
been spent over the last 2 years by this
administration.
I urge my colleagues to support my
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
time in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, it is
amazing to me that 17 navigators, ac-
cording to CMS, during the grant year
2016 to 2017, 17 of these navigators that
my friends on the other side of the
aisle are such big fans of enrolled fewer
than 100 people at an average cost of
$5,000 per enrollee. That doesn’t seem
to be very cost efficient to me.
As I have said before, today, The
Wall Street Journal investigation
found one grantee got 200 grand and en-
rolled one person. This is a great pro-
gram.
You can’t understand why the Trump
administration wants to cut back and
put some boundaries around? I can’t
imagine why you would embrace that.
I just don’t get it.
The top 10 most expensive navigators
collected $2.77 million, and they signed
up 314 people. Let that one sink in. I
mean, if you all want to embrace that,
that is up to you. Not the way I would
do business.
The Las Vegas Review-Journal edito-
rialized: ‘‘The navigator scheme is a
make-work government jobs program
rife with corruption and highly suscep-
tible to scam artists. It’s a slush fund
for progressive constituent groups.’’
That is a respected newspaper. The
journalist is writing this, Wall Street
Journal’s investigation.
We figure out $62.5 million in grants
enrolled 81,426 individuals. That is less
than 1 percent. That is your naviga-
tors, Mr. Chairman, that some are so
enthralled with; that is their body of
work: $62.5 million, 1 percent.
Now, if you just run a simple calcula-
tion, that means about $767 was spent

per individual that was enrolled. That
is a lot of money.
By contrast, agents and brokers as-
sisted with 42 percent of the federally
facilitated exchange enrollment for
plan year 2018, which cost the FFE only
$2.40, $2.40 per enrollee to provide
training and technical assistance.
So we have before us this oppor-
tunity to either fund a program that
appears to be susceptible to scam, ac-
cording to one paper: One person gets
enrolled, and one person gets paid
$200,000 to enroll that one person. That
is the outcome. That doesn’t seem to
make a lot of sense to me.
So I would say to my colleague from
California that where we really need
the transparency and accountability is
on the navigators themselves. That is
where we ought to be investigating.
And on the short-term duration
plans, it is unfortunate that Ms.
ESHOO’s amendment was not made in
order, because I agree that we need
more transparency on those plans so
people know what they are buying. I
don’t want anybody to get a plan that
doesn’t cover what they need. I don’t
think any of us do.
So, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gen-
tleman’s amendment, and unless any
other Member requests time, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. COX).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 24 OFFERED BY MR. COX OF
CALIFORNIA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 24 printed
in House Report 116–61.
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Chairman,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 48, line 20, after ‘‘populations,’’ insert
‘‘individuals residing in areas where the un-
employment rates exceeds the national aver-
age unemployment rate,’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from California (Mr. COX) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Chair, I
am honored to be here today to intro-
duce my amendment to H.R. 987, The
Strengthening Health Care and Low-
ering Prescription Drug Costs Act.
My amendment would ensure that
communities with high unemployment
numbers are prioritized in the navi-
gator outreach program.
The Affordable Care Act created nav-
igator programs to provide outreach,
education, and enrollment assistance
to consumers shopping for healthcare
coverage. Robust marketing and out-
reach programs through the navigator
program have been very successful
throughout the country and have dem-
onstrated meaningful benefits to our
consumers.
In my home State of California, we
have been making these necessary in-
vestments to ensure people throughout
our State get the information they
need to obtain coverage, and it works.
Our State-based marketplace, Covered
California, estimates that its invest-
ment in the marketing and outreach in
2015 and 2016 increased enrollment,
which reduced premiums by up to 8
percent for all of our enrolled mem-
bers. That is savings to all enrolled
members of some $576 million. Based on
a small budget of some $56 million,
that is a great investment. That is a
1,000 percent return on investment.
That is a great deal by anyone’s meas-
ure.
That is the goal: to reduce the num-
ber of uninsured Americans. We all
know that, when we have insurance, we
stay healthy, and this strengthens our
overall healthcare system, our commu-
nities, and our Nation.
That is why the navigator program is
so important, and the Trump adminis-
tration’s 84 percent cut to the program
since 2016 is just unacceptable. It is im-
perative that funding be restored to
navigator programs.
Navigator programs help those with-
out employer-sponsored insurance
through small companies, sole propri-
etors, contractors, and every one of
those entrepreneurs who are staking
their claim to the American Dream.
The fact is many people who are eli-
gible for financial assistance through
the ACA, which would help them ob-
tain coverage, don’t even know they
can get help, and this administration
wants to keep them in the dark. Some
40 percent of consumers today don’t
even know there are options available.
My congressional district has an un-
employment rate of almost 17 percent,
and this is made up of rural commu-
nities that face unique challenges and
barriers with respect to education,
communication, and transportation.
This makes it very difficult for my
constituents to receive information on
their healthcare insurance options.
This is so similar to many of our
rural communities across our Nation.
For many of those communities, the
navigator program is the only way
they can access this vital information.
Everyone should have health insur-
ance and know their healthcare op-
tions. Healthcare is a right, not a privi-
lege, and your ZIP Code should not dic-
tate your ability to obtain health in-
surance.
My amendment would help distressed
communities like those in my district
and so many more across our Nation
that may not have the resources to ac-
cess the full healthcare options. By
fully funding the navigator program
and by focusing our efforts on areas
that have high unemployment, we can
get more people covered. And that is
the goal.
Here in America, the building blocks
for success are a quality education,
dedication to hard work, and good
health. A healthy workforce is vital for
America’s success. We must fund the
navigator program to help educate
those who are difficult to reach geo-
graphically or who have limited access
to ACA resources.
This is a critical and necessary in-
vestment that will build stronger,
healthier, and more productive com-
munities and an America that dem-
onstrates that its best investments are
its people.
With that, I urge my colleagues to
support my amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition to the gentle-
man’s amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Chairman,
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, let me
just make a couple of points.
First of all, of course we want navi-
gators to work in areas where there is
high unemployment. My district, over
the years, has had some of the highest
unemployment in the State of Oregon.
Then I go down the list of future
amendments here, and it is like, oh, we
have got another one coming up that
ensures rural areas are included in the
navigator outreach. Well, that is a
good idea.
And then there is another one that
ensures that State healthcare exchange
outreach activities also target our vet-
eran population. Yes, that is a good
idea.
Why are we having to put all this in
statute? Who the heck is running this
program, and why is it such a mess
that it requires amendment after
amendment after amendment? My
point is: Where does this stop?
Of course we want them to work with
veterans. Of course we want them to
work with seniors and the young. Are
we going to go to age segments here, 18
to 29, 31 to—I mean, come on. Really?
We are going to put all this in statute?
How do they not have common sense?
Who are these navigators that we have
to direct them from the floor of the
House into statute? Oh, by the way, be
sure and work in an unemployed area.
Be sure to mention that there are serv-
ices for mental health and substance
abuse. Oh, don’t forget this, that, and
the other thing.
I mean, I think we only ran out of
amendments because we ran out of
ideas of things to put into the statute,
but that is no way to run a program.
And if it costs $767 for everyone they
sign up for the government to run its
navigator program but the private sec-
tor can do it for $2.40, that is not a very
economical way. You don’t make it up
in volume.
And of course we want people to get
access to insurance and information. I
was in the radio business for 20 years.
Our job was to get information out to
consumers, so I am all about that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3899
May 16, 2019
It is just amazing, though, when you
see the inefficiency of a Federal system
versus the efficiency of a private-sector
initiative.
And here we just passed an amend-
ment, $25 million more into this pro-
gram, and yet we know in some cases
there is enormous cost, and there ap-
pears to be, you know—I don’t know—
malfeasance. I don’t know what it is.
But if the top 10 most expensive navi-
gators collected $2.77 million to sign up
314 people, I think we are in the wrong
business. We ought to go be navigators
at that rate. That is a pretty good rate
of return for them, but not for the peo-
ple and the taxpayers.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), the Republican
leader of the United States House of
Representatives.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I
want to spend 1 minute and thank my
friend, Congressman WALDEN. I know
the work that he puts in when it comes
to healthcare for America.
Mr. Chairman, I know of a bill that
Mr. WALDEN has in to protect pre-
existing conditions. We have asked
many times to mark it up or bring it to
the floor—no, not brought. It is talked
about a lot, Mr. Chairman, but no bill
to bring it here.
I know your care when it comes to
not just healthcare, but the type of
treatment one is able to get, the qual-
ity of care out there, because, Mr.
Chairman, there are people out there
who will run health facilities for the
seniors but don’t do a very good job.
The quality is not there.
b 1800
People have lost their own
healthcare within there. People have
been fined by the way they have treat-
ed individuals and seniors. People have
lost eyes just because the treatment
had been poor.
Mr. Chairman, we are here today on
this floor because we all know that
drug prices are too high. That is why
the Energy and Commerce Committee
worked tirelessly to pass three
healthcare bills unanimously to ad-
dress that.
Now, how often is that said on this
floor? Not very often. It was a moment
that I heard from almost every member
on that committee, a moment of pride.
We could have legislation passed in a
bipartisan fashion today. We could
take it from that committee and bring
it to the floor, and we would have the
exact same thing happen. We could
have the Republicans and the Demo-
crats coming together to lower the
price of drugs.
You know who wins? All of America.
Sadly, however, these good faith ef-
forts have been unnecessarily thrown
into a partisan and senseless attempt
to bail out pieces of the Affordable
Care Act.
Now, I don’t say that—but I guess I
just did, Mr. Chairman. I knew it be-
cause I happen to be a Member of Con-
gress. I watched it because I watched
the committee work together, find
common ground in a place where it is
really difficult.
But when I looked at The Wash-
ington Post, it was very interesting.
This is what they said. They actually
put it best. Democrats are putting a
‘‘political pothole’’—yeah, that is what
they said—a ‘‘political pothole’’ in the
way of real drug pricing reform.
You know, if you ever spend time
back in your district or across this
country, I would promise you one of
the top three issues you will get is the
price of drugs. I think everybody in
this body was looking forward to this
day, prior to the Democrats playing
with political potholes.
Make no mistake, the drug pricing
component of H.R. 987 is very strong.
The three drug pricing bills in this leg-
islation get to the heart of the prob-
lem, the lack of competition in the ge-
neric drug market. Increased competi-
tion for generic drugs would lead to
lower prices and make medication
more accessible. Two things, I think,
anybody in America would desire.
Just think for a moment. You would
get more competition, more choice,
and lower prices.
We were so close. We got out of com-
mittee. The Members on both sides said
yes. The only step you had left: Go to
the Rules Committee and come to the
floor.
But as you pass through that com-
mittee to get to the Rules Committee
and get to the floor, I guess it had to go
through leadership. Leadership made a
choice: Politics before people.
These reforms would have removed
barriers to generic drugs entering the
market, making healthcare more af-
fordable for patients. It is a real
change.
That would have been a positive mo-
ment we all could have celebrated. But
you know what is going to happen
here? It is going to be a partisan vote
and a bill that goes nowhere.
It is going to be a pothole that most
people will say elected officials are
supposed to fix, not create. It is the op-
posite of what elected officials are sup-
posed to do. They are supposed to fill
in the potholes, not dig them.
But if you read The Washington Post,
they will tell you exactly who created
them—the Democrats.
There are a lot of things that happen
on this floor that at times are reckless,
irresponsible, and just downright em-
barrassing. Mr. Chairman, this is one
of them. Why at a time when both sides
say they want to lower the prices of
drugs and give people more options?
It goes to the core of the individual,
of their own health. Well, it goes to the
core of what the Democrats want to do.
They don’t want to make law. They
love playing politics.
You know what happens when they
play politics? Not only do keep drug
prices high, but they break another
promise.
I happen to have been in this body,
Mr. Chairman, when I heard those
words, that if you like your healthcare,
you could keep it.
I thought those millions of Ameri-
cans who lost their healthcare that
time, that that would be the end. But
no, Mr. Chairman, the Democrats took
the majority again. I thought that was
enough.
Had you taken enough health policies
away from millions of Americans? The
answer was no. They had a few more to
go. Mr. Chairman, 1.5 million, the Con-
gressional Budget Office says.
So think, tomorrow when Americans
wake up, there was a moment the
prices could be lower. But, no. Would
they ever think that not only are you
not going to lower them, but you are
going to take my healthcare away?
That is exactly what is going to hap-
pen here today. That is the poison pill
they added to the bills.
Mr. Chairman, 1.5 million Americans
will lose their plans. Now, if you listen
to the other side, they say, no, no, it is
net neutral. You know what it is? The
CBO says, no, it goes down to 500,000.
I have heard them use the Congres-
sional Budget Office thousands of
times, Mr. Chairman, on the floor. I
haven’t heard them use it today.
Mr. Chairman, if you read books
about politicians, if you read ‘‘The
Prince’’ and you read Machiavelli, it is
interesting, the ends justify the means.
That is what it says. You see, it is
about control. It is really about who
can control what you can have.
There was a moment there that you
would have greater options and lower
prices. No, we will tell you what you
need and what you can have.
There was a moment there that you
would have even greater options when
it came to healthcare. No, that is not
going to be. We are going to take that
away from you. And you know what? It
is going to cost you more when we do
it.
Mr. Chairman, I would say I would be
shocked that this was going to happen.
I can’t say I am shocked anymore be-
cause, Mr. Chairman, on one side of the
aisle in this Chamber, half of the entire
majority party has cosponsored a bill,
Medicare for none.
Not only are they taking more than
1.5 million Americans’ plans away
today, but they also have a plan to
take more than 150 million Americans’
plans away. They are going to bank-
rupt Medicare. They are going to deny
you if you have private healthcare
now.
But that is okay. The ends justify the
means. Why? Because they have con-
trol.
That is exactly what happened here,
Mr. Chairman. You had a committee
that worked in a bipartisan manner. It
is really irresponsible that the Rules
Committee or the leadership would un-
dercut their own chair of that com-
mittee to put a poison pill on three
bills that came out in a bipartisan
manner, with an idea that they would
work in good faith, with an idea that
they would put people before politics.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3900 May 16, 2019
When you study history, and they
talk about elected officials, they will
tell you even from the most local
places you get elected, the jobs you are
going to have are filling in potholes. I
never heard someone say your job as
elected officials is to create potholes,
but that is what we witnessed today.
It is a sad day for this House. We
could do so much better. We did in
committee.
Is it just, Mr. Chairman, that the ma-
jority doesn’t want to solve a problem?
Because, Mr. Chairman, I have
searched. They have been in power for
quite some time, and I have not found
one problem they have solved yet. I
found a few potholes they created. I
think we have enough problems.
When we have that moment that we
can come together inside of a com-
mittee, could we just keep it a little
longer so it can get to the floor?
Mr. Chairman, there will be an op-
tion. There will be an amendment in
this body that gives you an oppor-
tunity. If you were in that Committee
on Energy and Commerce and you
voted on these bills without the poison
pill, it will be your moment of truth. It
will tell a lot to America, Mr. Chair-
man, whether you serve your constitu-
ents or you serve your leadership.
That is what we will be watching.
That is what America will be won-
dering. That is what we all hope will
happen.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, may I
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining?
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. AGUILAR).
The gentleman has 11⁄2 minutes remain-
ing.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, again, I
thank the Republican leader of the
U.S. House for not only his leadership
on this issue but on so many others,
and for giving us clarity on what is
really going on here.
It is unfortunate. As The Washington
Post and other news media organiza-
tions reported, it didn’t have to be this
way. It didn’t have to be this way.
We did pass the three drug reform
bills unanimously out of the com-
mittee. I was a big supporter of them.
Every Republican was. I think every
Republican on the floor will be if they
get a chance to vote for those.
In the past, when I was chairman of
the committee, we moved over 143 bills
out of the committee. Ninety-three
percent of them had bipartisan votes
on the House floor. Fifty-seven became
law. One of those 57 contained about 60
different opioid bills we rolled into just
one.
I agree with the leader. This is going
to delay passage in the Senate because
they are going to have to sort this out,
rip it apart. The added spending and
the navigator piece probably don’t sur-
vive. But it didn’t have to be that way.
I found that if you have big bipar-
tisan support out of the House, you are
likely to get quicker action in the Sen-
ate, and it goes down to the President.
If you want to do something quickly
about high-cost drugs and stop bad be-
havior that denies access for new
generics, then you want to move quick-
ly, not slowly. You want to move in a
bipartisan way, not a partisan way. Un-
fortunately, that is not our way today.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. COX).
The amendment was agreed to.
The Acting CHAIR. The Chair is ad-

Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.

Page 48, line 20, after ‘‘populations,’’ insert
‘‘individuals in rural areas,’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentlewoman
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I am pleased today to offer
an amendment that ensures that rural
areas are included in navigator out-
reach under H.R. 987, the Strength-
ening Health Care and Lowering Pre-
scription Drug Costs Act.
This amendment ensures that the
navigators who help people understand
their options under the Affordable Care
Act also help our rural communities.
The overall bill places federally fund-
ed grants in communities across the
country to pay navigators who play a
vital role in helping Americans under-
stand their health coverage options in
the marketplace. It helps them know
what they qualify for.
Without question, access to
healthcare is one of our Nation’s most
critical issues. This is true across the
country, whether in major metropoli-
tan areas, big cities, small towns, on
the coasts, or in the heartland. But
specific problems look different from
place to place, and our rural commu-
nities are undoubtedly struggling.
One of the worst outcomes in rural
communities of lack of access to
healthcare is hospital closures.
Sadly, Oklahoma is no stranger to
them. We have already lost six hos-
pitals since 2010, and many more are
teetering on the edge.
Simply put, hospitals can’t stay open
when their patients don’t have cov-
erage and the hospitals aren’t able to
pay their bills.
Right now, Oklahoma has the second
highest uninsured rate in the Nation,
and our rural areas often bear the
brunt of the coverage gap. They simply
don’t have enough patients with cov-
erage to offset the ones without it.
The Washington Post just wrote a
story about a 15-bed hospital in my
home State in a town called Fairfax.
Fairfax Community Hospital is so close
to closing that their computer software
won’t operate because the licensing
fees haven’t been paid.
Their air-conditioning is also shut
down. Imagine that, as it gets hotter
and hotter in the Oklahoma summer-
time.
I want to share an excerpt of the
story because these matters are about
real lives. It is not about numbers.
These are about people who are suf-
fering because they don’t have access
to care.
b 1815
It starts with CEO Tina Steele talk-
ing to the employees who are crammed
in a crowded office and sweating.
‘‘So how desperate are we?’’ One em-
ployee asked. ‘‘How much money do we
have in the bank?’’
‘‘Somewhere around $12,000,’’ Steele
said.
‘‘And how long will that last us?’’
‘‘Under normal circumstances?’’
Steele asked. She looked down at a
chart on her desk and ran calculations
in her head. ‘‘Probably a few hours.
Maybe a day at most.’’
The only reason the hospital had
been able to stay open at all was be-
cause about 30 employees continued
showing up to work without pay. There
was no other hospital within 30 miles
of the two-lane roads and prairie in
sprawling Osage County, which meant
Fairfax Community was the only life-
line in that part of the county that in-
creasingly needed rescuing.
‘‘If we aren’t open, where do these
people go?’’ asked a physician assist-
ant, thinking about the dozens of pa-
tients he treated each month in the
ER, including some in critical condi-
tion after drug overdoses, falls from
horses, oil field disasters, and car
crashes.
‘‘They’ll go to the cemetery,’’ an-
other employee said. ‘‘If we’re not here,
these people don’t have time. They’ll
die along with this hospital.’’
Like I said, there are similar stories
in other hospitals that have played out
six times across Oklahoma, and in
many other places. According to some
estimates, there are 102 hospitals that
have closed nationwide, and we, as
Americans, can’t let our neighbors die
simply because they live in small
towns. We must solve this rural health
crisis.
Navigators are a part of this solu-
tion. This amendment makes sure that
we help people living in small towns
across Oklahoma and the country stay
healthy and understand their options
so that they can take care of them-
selves and their families.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
time in opposition to the amendment.

Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chair, adding on to this, the inclu-
sion of rural communities with naviga-
tors serving them is critical, because
from 2016 to 2018, Oklahoma lost 78 per-
cent of its navigator funding. The very
communities that are in the most need,
where people have the least access to
services and understanding, including
broadband, so that they can access the
services they need, are the very ones
that are suffering most.
These closures and the lack of access
not only have an effect in the commu-
nities that directly impact them, but
ripple across my State and this Nation.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I am
outraged to find out that these naviga-
tors are not reaching out to people in
rural areas. What we have learned
today on the House floor is that appar-
ently this program doesn’t reach peo-
ple in rural areas. That is why the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma has this
amendment, apparently. These naviga-
tors, what the heck do they do?
We have had amendments to say you
have got to have navigators reach out
to people on Medicaid. You have got to
have navigators reach out to people on
the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram. We have to tell them that? What
have they been doing?
We are going to have an amendment
coming up saying, Navigators, we are
going to put into Federal law that you
have to reach out to the veterans’ com-
munity. They don’t do that today? Are
you serious?
And we are going to have navigators
that have to be educated. When you are
reaching out, you better talk about
mental health services and substance
abuse. Have they been ignoring that all
along? I guess so.
Because my friends on the other side
of the aisle have been bringing amend-
ment after amendment to correct these
obvious omissions and problems with
the navigator program. What has been
going on in the navigator program?
This is outrageous to learn that rural
areas—and I represent an area that
would stretch from the Atlantic Ocean
to Ohio, 69,000 square miles—and you
are talking about rural. I am going to
find out why the heck those navigators
aren’t talking to people in my district,
and why we have to put in law that
they have to now.
How many years has this been going
on under ObamaCare, and at what cost
to taxpayers? And you are going to
give them another $25 million. Who are
they talking to? Are they talking to
people in suburban areas only, or urban
areas only?
But if they are not talking about
Medicaid and CHIP, and apparently not
to veterans, who are they counseling
and what are they telling them? What
a disaster of a program. We ought to
halt right now and figure out who are
these people and what are they getting
paid to do.
We know they cost $767 for every en-
rollee, compared to $2.40 in the private
sector. So we are paying them a lot. We
know that investigations have shown
that one grantee took $200,000 and en-
rolled one person, and, apparently, that
person was not a veteran, not on Med-
icaid, not in a rural area, and not on
CHIP. Who knows. Right?
I appreciate the gentlewoman’s
amendment, but I am astonished to
learn of the fact that we have to put it
in law that they have to talk to people
in rural areas. This demands investiga-
tion to figure out what in the heck is
going on.
Now, let’s talk about what else is fac-
ing us. What really takes care of people
in rural areas are our community
health centers, 27 million people, 1 in
12 in every State. The District of Co-
lumbia and the territories rely on com-
munity health centers for their care,
and of the patients treated at these
centers, one in three are living in pov-
erty; one in five are rural residents;
and one in nine are children.
If you want to put the taxpayer
money to good purpose, it would be to
fund our community health centers,
like Republicans led the way on last
time at record levels because we know
they deliver for people in rural areas.
They deliver for people in urban areas.
They deliver quality care.
That is where our money should go,
not into a program like this, appar-
ently, that we have to have these
amendments from Democrat Members.
I think we had 25 amendments from
Democrat Members telling navigators
we are going to go to rural areas, we
are going to go to veterans. Who are
they serving today? It is a mess.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA
S. HORN).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 27 OFFERED BY MR.
CUNNINGHAM
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 27 printed
in House Report 116–61.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 48, line 20, after ‘‘populations,’’ insert
‘‘veterans,’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 377, the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from South Carolina.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in support of my straight-
forward, commonsense amendment
which will ensure that our Nation’s
veterans have access to quality, afford-
able health insurance coverage.
While people often think that every-
one who has served in the military im-
mediately has access to VA healthcare,
this is not the case. In fact, only three
out of five veterans under the age of 65
are eligible for healthcare through the
VA, and only a quarter of those who
are eligible for VA healthcare rely on
the VA as their sole source of insur-
ance.
Younger veterans who served for 24
consecutive months are eligible for VA
coverage for 5 years after their dis-
charge, and veterans over the age of 65
qualify for Medicare. This leaves a po-
tential gap in coverage for many vet-
erans who have recently served after
their 5-year period and before they be-
come eligible for Medicare.
That is why it is imperative that the
healthcare exchange outreach and edu-
cational strategies be designed in a
way to reach our Nation’s veterans.
As a Member of the House Committee
on Veterans’ Affairs, I am committed
to ensuring every veteran has access to
high-quality healthcare regardless of
where they receive that care.
Studies show that when Americans
are informed about the correct time to
sign up for healthcare, and the options
to make that coverage affordable, they
choose to get insured.
My amendment is simply asking that
we make our Nation’s veterans aware
of the healthcare options available to
them. This is particularly important to
the Lowcountry, because my district
has one of the highest concentrations
of veterans in the entire country.
It has the highest concentrations in
the entire State of South Carolina, and
I want to make sure that each of them
are aware of their coverage options so
that they can make the best choice for
themselves and for their families.
Mr. Chair, I want to ask my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
join me in supporting my amendment
as well as the underlying legislation.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek
time in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, as I
said in the last amendment debate, it
is astonishing to me that apparently
these navigators aren’t serving people
in rural areas, and now I find out that
they are apparently not serving our
veteran population effectively as well.
I am going to reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, in
closing, I would like to thank Chair-
man PALLONE and Chairman SCOTT for
their work in constructing this impor-
tant legislation which will lower drug
prices, stabilize the insurance market,
and decrease premiums for hard-
working families across this country.
I also want to thank Chairman
MCGOVERN and my colleagues on the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3902 May 16, 2019
Rules Committee for allowing my
amendment to come to the floor. I urge
all of my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to vote in favor of this com-
monsense amendment as well as the
underlying legislation.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for his service to the
country and all of our veterans, men
and women, who wear our uniform and
deserve our undying appreciation and
thanks.
But it is astonishing, once again, it is
appalling that these navigators appar-
ently aren’t serving our veterans. We
have to come to the floor with amend-
ments to Federal law to order them to
take care of our veterans. What kind of
program is this?
We know it is expensive. We know
some in the news media, some of the
editorial writers in our country said it
is open to fraud and—let me read it.
An editorial paper out West said, ‘‘In
reality, the navigator scheme is a
make-work government jobs program
rife with corruption and highly suscep-
tible to scam artists. It’s a slush fund
for progressive constituent groups.’’
That is how one editorial came out. I
am sure there are good people in there
somewhere doing good work, but we
know that according to CMS, 17 navi-
gators enrolled less than 100 people at
an average cost of $5,000 per enrollee.
What kind of program is this? We know
it is expensive.
One grantee took in $200,000 and en-
rolled one person. The top ten most ex-
pensive collected $2.77 million and
signed up 314 people. So it is ineffi-
cient, but at least it is really expen-
sive. What a waste.
I am sure they enroll people, but only
1 percent of those enrolled in the ex-
change are helped by navigators. And
then today, we find out that we have to
tell them what to do, which makes you
wonder, what have they been doing?
Because we have had amendments to
say, you have got to have them educate
people about Medicaid, or CHIP, or vet-
erans, rural areas, mental health, sub-
stance abuse—one thing after another.
I think we ought to investigate them
and the whole program stem to stern.
If there is waste and fraud, we ought
to go after it. If there is all of this ex-
pense, we ought to knock it down. And
if they are not serving people—I am
glad we had the rural amendment. Do
we need one for urban, and suburban,
and semi-frontier counties? It makes
me wonder who they do serve. We know
it is expensive.
Obviously, we are going to tell them
to serve the veterans. You know that
makes sense.
I am glad your amendment got made
in order. We had 16 Republican amend-
ments. They only made one in order.
There were 25 Democratic amendments
made in order. Two of those we had to
edit on the floor, and one technical
amendment.
It seems an odd way to run the
House. We were promised in the open-
ing days by the chairman of the Rules
Committee that it was all going to be
different. Boy, he was right. It is just a
different way.
I think that our Member on the
Rules Committee could probably tell
us 92 percent of the amendments that
have been allowed on the House floor
have been from Democrats. When Re-
publicans were in the majority, 45 per-
cent of the amendments came from
Democrats. We tried to have an open
process. Now we are being shut out,
and that is unfortunate.
So, Mr. Chairman, we have had a
long day here. I think we all care deep-
ly about making sure people have ac-
cess to affordable healthcare. Repub-
licans believe we need to reform how
our systems work. We need to drive
down the cost of drugs, and nobody has
led more on this in my history around
here than the President of the United
States, Donald Trump.
From day one, he has told the drug
companies: You need to get your prices
down. I was with him in the White
House when he said that in about Feb-
ruary of 2017, and he has never re-
lented. And he is a partner in this
progress to go after surprise billing, to
go after high drug costs. He is leading
through his administration, and he will
sign the drug bills that we worked out
in committee.
The travesty is the pothole created
by the Democrat politicos that said we
have got to link the drug bills we all
have agreement on that the President
would sign, to bills that we know are
bailing out ObamaCare. And worse, we
are now funding huge money, and even
more authorized today, into a program
that apparently wasn’t taking care of
veterans, nor people in rural areas.
b 1830
It is astonishing. So, Mr. Chairman,
this amendment is fine. It makes sense.
It is just outrageous we have to put in
Federal law that these navigators have
to actually help veterans because they
ought to be doing that day in and day
out. Veterans are the ones who give us
our freedom. We need to investigate
the navigators.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr.
CUNNINGHAM).
The amendment was agreed to.

The Clerk will redesignate the
amendment.

NDA or BLA holder (or by such subsequent
filer) that is reasonably attributable to the
violation of this section; or

quent filer (or to the other subsequent filer)
reasonably attributable to the violation of
this section; and

subsequent filer that is reasonably attrib-
utable to the violation of this section.
(ii) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—In deter-
mining such amount, the court shall take
into account—
(I) the nature, circumstances, extent, and
gravity of the violation;
(II) with respect to the violator, the degree
of culpability, any history of violations, the
ability to pay, any effect on the ability to

quent filers, the subsequent filer who re-
ceived the value described in subsection
(a)(1)), and the amount of commerce af-
fected; and
(III) other matters that justice requires.
(D) INJUNCTIONS AND OTHER EQUITABLE RE-
LIEF.—In a civil action under subparagraph
(A), the United States district courts are em-
powered to grant mandatory injunctions and

subsection (a) if the Commission finds such
agreements to be in furtherance of market
competition and for the benefit of con-
sumers.

tion shall modify, impair, limit, or supersede
the applicability of the antitrust laws as de-
fined in subsection (a) of the first section of
the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12(a)), and of sec-
tion 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act
(15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent that such section

tion brought under paragraph (1), an eligible
product developer shall prove, by a prepon-
derance of the evidence—
(i) that—
(I) the covered product is not subject to a

mail with return receipt requested;
(III) specified an individual as the point of
contact for the license holder to direct com-
munications related to the sale of the cov-

oper and a means for electronic and written
communications with that individual; and
(IV) specified an address to which the cov-
ered product was to be shipped upon reaching
an agreement to transfer the covered prod-
uct; and

involve human clinical trials, if the eligible
product developer has agreed to comply with
any conditions the Secretary determines
necessary; or
(II) development and testing that involves
human clinical trials, if the eligible product
developer has—
(aa)(AA) submitted protocols, informed
consent documents, and informational mate-
rials for testing that include protections
that provide safety protections comparable
to those provided by the REMS for the cov-
ered product; or
(BB) otherwise satisfied the Secretary that
such protections will be provided; and
(bb) met any other requirements the Sec-
retary may establish.
(iii) NOTICE.—A covered product authoriza-
tion issued under this subparagraph shall
state that the provision of the covered prod-
uct by the license holder under the terms of

cient quantities on commercially reasonable,
market-based terms from the agents, dis-
tributors, or wholesalers of the license hold-
er; or

the individual specified pursuant to para-
graph (2)(A)(iii)(III), by a means of commu-
nication (electronic, written, or both) speci-
fied pursuant to such paragraph, to sell suffi-
cient quantities of the covered product to
the eligible product developer at commer-
cially reasonable market-based terms—
(i) for a covered product that is not subject

on commercially reasonable, market-based
terms;
(ii) award to the eligible product developer
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of the

(iii) award to the eligible product devel-
oper a monetary amount sufficient to deter
the license holder from failing to provide eli-
gible product developers with sufficient
quantities of a covered product on commer-
cially reasonable, market-based terms, if the
court finds, by a preponderance of the evi-
dence—
(I) that the license holder delayed pro-
viding sufficient quantities of the covered
product to the eligible product developer
without a legitimate business justification;
or
(II) that the license holder failed to comply
with an order issued under clause (i).
(B) MAXIMUM MONETARY AMOUNT.—A mone-

ods or operational means than the strategy
required under subsection (a) for the applica-
ble listed drug, or other application under

but achieves the same level of safety as such
strategy.’’.

TITLE II—SUPPORTING PEDIATRIC
CANCER RESEARCH
SEC. 201. FINDING; SENSE OF CONGRESS.
According to the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, the bipartisan provisions of title I of
this Act decrease Federal spending by over
$4,000,000,000. It is the sense of Congress that
these savings should be redirected to the Na-
tional Institutes of Health Innovation Ac-
count to be made available to support pedi-
atric cancer research as provided by the
amendments made by section 202.
SEC. 202. PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH.
Section 1001(b) of the 21st Century Cures
Act (Public Law 114–255) is amended—
(1) in paragraph (3), by amending subpara-
graph (A) to read as follows:
‘‘(A) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—
For each of the fiscal years 2017 through 2026,
there is authorized to be appropriated from
the Account to the Director of NIH, for the
purpose of carrying out the NIH Innovation
Projects, an amount not to exceed the total
amount transferred to the Account under
paragraph (2)(A), plus $4,963,000,000 for the
period of fiscal years 2020 through 2024, to re-
main available until expended.’’; and
(2) in paragraph (4), by adding at the end
the following new subparagraph:
‘‘(E) For pediatric cancer research, not to
exceed a total of $4,963,000,000 for the period
of fiscal years 2020 through 2024.’’.
Mr. WALDEN (during the reading).
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent
to dispense with the reading.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, Repub-
licans and Democrats worked together
on provisions to bring generic drugs to
market faster and to stop abusive prac-
tices. We did that on the Energy and
Commerce Committee, and we brought
this House multiple bills to achieve
that goal, and we did it unanimously.
We believe our bipartisan work will
increase competition and ultimately
help lower the cost of prescription
drugs.
These policies passed unanimously
out of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. They help consumers, and they
have the added benefit of helping the
Federal Government by producing $4
billion in savings.
Unfortunately, our friends on the
other side of the aisle, Democrats, de-
cided to pair these bipartisan bills to
lower drug costs with what they knew
were very partisan bills that I, frankly,
think waste taxpayer money in many
cases.
We ought to be working together on
this, not descending ‘‘into partisan pol-
itics on a seemingly bipartisan issue.’’
Those are the words of STAT News as
reported today.
The fact is, when we do work to-
gether, we can achieve real results. In
the last Congress, we reauthorized the
Food and Drug Administration, and we
gave that agency the tools and re-
sources to get generic drugs into mar-
ket faster.
It is already working. Our work pro-
duced, with the FDA’s efforts, a record
number of generic drugs coming to
market, driving competition, and giv-
ing consumers more choices.
We did the same thing in the prior
Congress when FRED UPTON and DIANA
DEGETTE led the effort on 21st Century
Cures so we could invest in medical re-
search. That was bipartisan.
Unfortunately, today you have par-
tisan bills coupled with bipartisan
bills, a poison pill, if you will. And the
Democrats have decided to use the
money, in part generated by our work
on generic drugs, to fund more naviga-
tors.
Let me just talk briefly about navi-
gators.
They cost you an average of $767
every time they sign up an individual.
In the private sector, it is $2.40. And
they just added another $25 million to
that.
The Wall Street Journal reported one

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3909
May 16, 2019
The top 10 most expensive navigators
collected $2.77 million in contracts
from the Federal Government. They
signed up 314 people. That is how they
spent the money.
One newspaper editorialized: ‘‘The
navigator scheme is a make-work gov-
ernment jobs program rife with corrup-
tion and highly susceptible to scam
artists.’’
Today on the House floor, you will
have a choice with this motion to re-
commit, and the choice is to spend it
that way and add more money into
that navigator program, that, by the
way, we just approved a bunch of
amendments to tell navigators to go
work with people in rural areas, to
work with people on CHIP, veterans.
Apparently, they weren’t working with
any of those folks.
So the motion to recommit says this:
same drug bills that we passed out of
committee, so you will be able to vote
‘‘yes’’ on those, and then the money
that is generated, rather than going to
this flawed navigator program will go
to the NIH innovation fund to support
childhood cancer research. That is your
choice.
By using the savings from the drug
pricing provisions to pay for childhood
cancer research, this amendment
makes clear the bipartisan drug pricing
offsets should be used to pay for bipar-
tisan healthcare priorities.
So, if you support lowering the cost
of prescription drugs and you support
the work of the NIH and its efforts to
save countless lives of children with
cancer, then you vote ‘‘yes’’ on the mo-
tion to recommit.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
opposition to the motion to recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Georgia is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker,
healthcare is an issue that is deeply
personal to me. I, myself, like millions
of Americans, live with a preexisting
condition.
As a two-time breast cancer survivor,
I understand what it is like to have
your life turned upside down by a diag-
nosis. Treatment was exhausting, both
physically and emotionally. I did it all
while raising my family and working
full-time. I was terrified.
Despite being lucky in having health
insurance through my job, I was still
worried about my financial security. I
was concerned about making it to my
radiation treatments every single day,
sometimes for weeks, and then back to
work and then back home to raise my
son, Jordan.
I had to do it, just like millions of
Americans out there who share a simi-
lar story like mine. I truly don’t know
what I would have done or what would
have happened if I had lost that
healthcare insurance.
Over 300,000 Georgians in my State,
in my district have a preexisting condi-
tion. Over 45,000 of those people are
children under the age of 17.
My colleagues here are worried about
the health and well-being of their con-
stituents, and we have heard countless
heart-wrenching stories from Ameri-
cans across the Nation—our neighbors,
our friends, and our loved ones.
Americans are simply worried about
their healthcare. I am worried about
their healthcare. They are tired of
these games.
Let’s stop playing politics with the
health and well-being of the American
people. It just needs to stop.
Last year, the Trump administration
allowed the expanded sale of junk in-
surance plans, many of which do not
cover maternity care, mental and be-
havioral health, or coverage to treat
preexisting conditions.
Under these plans, women can be
charged more than men; insurance
companies can cancel coverage as soon
as an enrollee gets sick. People en-
rolled in these plans might seek care
for themselves or for a family member
only to be left out in the cold without
coverage.
No matter what the White House or
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle cook it up to, the American peo-
ple have said time and time again that
they oppose plans that rip healthcare
coverage away from those with pre-
existing conditions.
While the motion does attempt to
fund vital public health services and
programs that have long garnered bi-
partisan support, the funding levels fail
to provide greater investments to these
programs. I know that we can work to-
gether to fund these programs, but
keeping the administration’s junk plan
rule on the books would harm public
health and not help it.
We don’t have to make these false
choices. This underlying bill combines
key pieces of legislation that lower
drug costs, strengthen healthcare, re-
verse the sabotage, and rescind the ad-
ministration’s junk plan rule.
We are making it easier for American
families to assess and sign up for af-
fordable healthcare.
We are making sure that plans cover
essential health benefits, like mater-
nity care and treatment for substance
use disorder.
We are making sure that patients do
not face annual or lifetime caps.
We are making sure that patients are
not discriminated against based on
their preexisting conditions, like my-
self.
This is what we are elected to do for
the American people.
Republicans plan to support protec-
tions for preexisting conditions, but
they have failed to condemn the ad-
ministration’s decision asking the
courts to invalidate the entire ACA.
They have failed to call on the Presi-
dent to reverse course. They have re-
fused to join us in condemning the ad-
ministration’s refusal to defend the law
of the land.
If our colleagues on the other side of
the aisle are serious about protecting
preexisting conditions, they will sup-
port the underlying bill and defeat this
MTR.
Action, not words, is what the Amer-
ican people demand, and it is what
they deserve. Democrats are com-
mitted to putting consumers first.
We will fight relentlessly to protect
individuals with preexisting conditions
and expand coverage to more Ameri-
cans.
We will make sure no one—abso-
lutely no one—has to choose between a
prescription drug or their mortgage.
That is unconscionable.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join us in standing for ensuring Ameri-
cans have access to affordable
healthcare and prescription drugs. I
stand in opposition to this MTR. I urge
my colleagues to join me in opposing
the political ploy that would hurt
American families, those with pre-
existing conditions, and those who are
trying to afford their healthcare and
prescription drugs.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.

A recorded vote was ordered.

ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair

FIGHTING FOR ACCESS TO HIGH-

Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr.

it is essential to daily life. You cannot

H3912 May 16, 2019
I was recently blessed to come
through a health challenge myself, and
I believe more strongly than ever that,
whether it is cancer therapy or pre-
scription medication, access to the best
treatment cannot be reserved for only
the wealthy.
Last week, I secured funding in the
Appropriations Committee to study the
impact of prior authorization policies
on patient health. People are dying be-
cause insurance companies want to see
lower cost treatments, see them fail
before they will cover more expensive
ones, even if your healthcare provider
specifically recommends it.
Whether you have cancer like I did or
you are dealing with a chronic illness,
you shouldn’t have to endure extra
pain or wonder if you can survive long
enough to get to the treatment that
will work for you.
I will continue to fight for access to
high-quality healthcare for all Ameri-
cans.

IN RECOGNITION OF ALEX KUNDA
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.
Alex Kunda for becoming the first stu-
dent in the history of the Glynn Coun-
ty School System to have perfect at-
tendance from kindergarten through
12th grade.
When Mr. Kunda was 4 years old, his
sister, Miranda, passed away from a
rare illness. At that time, his sister
had maintained perfect attendance
through her time in elementary school
and during her medical treatment.
Receiving an award onstage on her
behalf before her passing, Mr. Kunda
pledged to his sister that he would con-
tinue her streak for as long as possible.
Madam Speaker, 13 years later, he
has done it. He hasn’t been tardy. He
hasn’t been absent. He hasn’t checked
out one single time during his entire
primary and secondary education.
He and his family plan trips and ap-
pointments all around his ability to go
to school, while fighting the urge to oc-
casionally skip or use a sick day.
Keeping a promise as difficult as this
one should be an inspiration to us all.
Congratulations, Mr. Kunda. Good
luck at the College of Coastal Georgia.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE
WEEK
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, this
week, my community and communities
across our Nation are paying tribute to
law enforcement officers who made the
ultimate sacrifices in our defense.
National Police Week is a moment to
reflect on those sacrifices and the men
and women who put their lives on the
line for ours.
It is a moment to recognize the fami-
lies who live with this immeasurable
sacrifice, and it is a moment to reaf-
firm our commitment to working with
local and State leaders to support
these families.
We owe it to the memory of fallen of-
ficers and to the majority of men and
women in uniform who carry out their
responsibilities with skill and profes-
sionalism every day to make sure that
officers are safe.
We all need to do our part to ensure
that the communities they serve are
safe as well.
In this same spirit of progress, let’s
commit to working to shape a more se-
cure future for officers and for the
communities they serve.

EXTEND THE SEPTEMBER 11TH
VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND
(Mr. ZELDIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, during
this National Police Week, I encourage
all my colleagues to cosponsor Never
Forget the Heroes Act, H.R. 1327, intro-
duced by Congress Members MALONEY,
KING, and NADLER, which would fully
fund and extend the Victim Compensa-
tion Fund authorization through 2090.
There are currently 279 cosponsors,
but we need more, and we need action
on this important legislation.
This should not be a partisan issue. It
is not a partisan issue. This needs to be
an American issue.
September 11th first responders came
from at least 433 out of 435 congres-
sional districts. We lost thousands of
Americans on 9/11. We have lost more
Americans since 9/11 due to toxic expo-
sure than we did on 9/11 itself.
Any colleagues out there who haven’t
cosponsored yet, I encourage you to
look at H.R. 1327.
Chairman NADLER has scheduled it
for a hearing on July 11. Please do
what you can to get this passed and
signed into law.

HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was

Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker,
I rise today during National Police
Week to honor law enforcement offi-
cers across Arizona and the Nation.
As a former investigator and officer,
I know what the brave men and women
and their families go through every
day to protect their communities.
This week brings back the memories
of the friends and partners I have
served alongside during my time on the
force. We remember the officers who
have been killed in the line of duty,
many of them friends of mine, includ-
ing DPS Officer Tyler Edenhofer and
Jesus Cordova.
We will never forget their service to
our State and our country.
Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues
this week in thanking the men and
women who serve our communities,
protect our families, and allow us to
continue to be a free society.

IN RECOGNITION OF FIRST
LIEUTENANT HOPE KIRKENDALL
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor First Lieutenant Hope
Kirkendall, a distinguished veteran
from Lakeland, Florida, who served in
World War II.
Lieutenant Kirkendall heard the call
to serve after seeing the bombing of
Pearl Harbor when she was only 18
years old.
She joined the Army as a nurse,
where she was one of the first women
deployed to Normandy after D–Day.
During her deployment, she routinely
worked 12- to 16-hour days near the
front lines of many major battles, in-
cluding the Battle of the Bulge.
She treated both wounded American
and German soldiers. In 2004, she re-
ceived the French Legion of Honor
award for her service in saving France
from German occupiers.
Lieutenant Kirkendall provided hope
to many on the battlefield, and her leg-
acy continues to provide hope to us at
home.
Lieutenant Kirkendall represents our
very best, and I thank her for all that
she has done to defend and serve our
great Nation.

ADDRESS SKYROCKETING COST OF
COLLEGE
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
right now, we are in the season where
folks are deciding where to go to col-
lege. A big factor in that decision is
their financial aid package.
The skyrocketing cost of college is
saddling many with outrageous student
loan debt. The crippling debt of student
loans is reaching $1.56 trillion among 45
million borrowers. It is causing people
to delay homeownership, raising a fam-
ily, and moving comfortably into the
middle class.
I have introduced the Understanding
the True Cost of College Act. It is to
help students and families make in-
formed decisions about financing their
education and their future by requiring
the standardization of communications
and the definitions of financial aid
terms.
It is in the best interest of our coun-
try to start addressing this issue in a
bipartisan way.

TACKLE ISSUES AFFECTING
BLACK MEN AND BOYS
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, from
their health outcomes to their unem-
ployment income, from their education
rate to their incarceration rate, Black
men and boys are disproportionately
impacted by government policies.
It is not that Black men and boys are
falling behind. It is that they have
never been ahead.
For centuries, government policies
have redlined Black men and boys into
a lower social status than their White
counterparts. This is an institutional
problem.
Yesterday, I joined with many of my
colleagues at the House Triangle to
stand in support of Congresswoman
FREDERICA WILSON’s bill to create the
Commission on the Social Status of
Black Men and Boys.
We were joined by young men who
want nothing more than to live the
American Dream free of discrimina-
tion. This country owes them that.
H.R. 1636 will bring together experts
to tackle the wide range of issues that
have kept Black men and boys behind
for hundreds of years. It will mark the
beginning of the end of racial dispari-
ties that have kept communities across
the country down.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port it.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAURICE A.
FERRE
(Mr. SOTO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to talk about the life of a hero of
mine, Maurice A. Ferre. He is a Puerto
Rican-born public servant who is a
former six-term mayor of the city of
Miami and the first Hispanic mayor of
any major American city, serving from
1973 to 1985.
He has served as the chair of the
Miami-Dade County Expressway Au-
thority and served for 8 years on the
Florida Transportation Commission.
As mayor, Ferre provided leadership
and vision when Miami took its place
as one of the world’s most vibrant cit-
ies, eclectic and diverse and inter-
national in nature.
Throughout his years in office, he fo-
cused on economic development, job
creation, and a visionary approach to
improving south Florida’s transpor-
tation and public infrastructure, as
well as transforming the area into a
center of inter-American trade, bank-
ing, and commerce.
He remains active in business, com-
mentary on current events, teaching,
and public service.
In 2006, he explored issues concerning
Puerto Rico in a book on political sta-
tus, ‘‘Where is Puerto Rico Headed?’’—
‘‘Hacia Donde Va Puerto Rico?’’
His career has been marked by a
style of public service that encourages
people from widely different views and
philosophies to work together in the
name of common good and progress.
Ferre embarked on that journey
early on as a Florida House member,
then a commissioner, later the mayor
of the city of Miami, and as vice chair-
man of the Dade County Board of Com-
missioners.
Ferre has served on numerous boards,
as well as on President Ford’s commis-
sion on immigration and President
Carter’s ambassadorial nominating
commission.
Ferre credits his wife of 64 years,
Mercedes Malaussena Ferre, as his
north star, and his loving family, in-
cluding 6 children and 13 grand-
children, as his anchor.
f
BREAK THE CORPORATE STRAN-
GLEHOLD ON OUR HEALTH AND
WELL-BEING
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, we
must have a moral awakening, a spir-
itual revolution on how we treat a per-
son’s health in this country.
We must understand that every sin-
gle human has a right to be healthy
and comfortable, to live with dignity,
and to receive the healthcare they need
to flourish.
At present, this understanding is in
conflict with a sinister, unjust force in
our society: corporate greed.
Why are people forced to skip insulin
injections so they can pay their rent?
Why are my residents charged $70 for
a PrEP, a pill that could dramatically
reduce HIV transmission, when the
same pill costs $7 abroad?
Corporate greed has replaced the
moral imperative that everyone live in
health and dignity. There is more
wealth in this country than any other
in human history, and millions go
without health insurance and prescrip-
tion drugs, people condemned to live
with pain and suffering because we
have chosen corporate profits over our
dignity as a nation.
We are watching a crisis unfold in
real time. It is time we break the cor-
porate stranglehold on our health and
well-being, lost profits of the insanely
wealthy be damned.
We have much more important
things to protect. We have the soul of
this country to rescue.

There was no objection.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
this week, thousands of law enforce-
ment officers, their families, and their
supporters from around the country
gathered in Washington, D.C., to com-
memorate National Police Week.
We are here tonight to thank those
who put on the uniform every day to
protect our communities and put their
lives in the breach between the crimi-
nal element and the public they pro-
tect.
We are also here to recognize those
who have completed their service and
now enjoy a well-deserved thank-you
for their selfless service to their com-
munities.
But, most importantly, we are here
to honor the fallen.
Last year, 158 police officers gave
their last measure of devotion to their
communities. Among these heroes, you
will find every gender, every creed,
every race, every religion. They hail
from every corner of America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3914 May 16, 2019
One of those 158 officers was not only
from my district, but served at the
Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office with me,
where I spent a 41-year career.
Officer Lance Whitaker began his ca-
reer with the Atlantic Beach Police De-
partment and then served 17 dedicated
years at Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.
He was tragically killed while respond-
ing to a call in the early morning hours
of May 15, 2018, almost 1 year ago
today.
He left behind his son, Cade; his
mother, Lannie; and his sister, Angela.
He also left behind a memory and a leg-
acy that will live on in the hearts and
minds of those who knew him.
Many of us are here today to honor
friends, family, and loved ones like Of-
ficer Whitaker, who gave his last full
measure of devotion to a community
he loved and a community that loved
him back.
I now ask that we observe a moment
of silence for Officer Whitaker and all
of the 158 brave law enforcement offi-
cers who lost their lives protecting our
community.
Tonight, Madam Speaker, in a very
bipartisan fashion, we will hear from
Members on both sides of the aisle and
from all across the country as we join
together to show our unity in sup-
porting our police officers.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield
to the gentlewoman from California
(Ms. HILL), my friend who is from a law
enforcement family and brings a strong
pro-police voice to Congress.
Ms. HILL of California. Madam
Speaker, I want to thank my colleague
from Florida for joining forces with me
this evening to host this bipartisan
Special Order hour in honor of Na-
tional Police Week.
As you are about to see, supporting
our law enforcement is an issue that
unifies us across geography and polit-
ical party, bringing together diverse
perspectives and deep gratitude. I am
so proud to rise in support of our law
enforcement and the professional peace
officers who work tirelessly every sin-
gle day for the safety and security of
our communities.
I represent California’s 25th Congres-
sional District, which is home to many
of the police officers who serve all of
Los Angeles County. My community is
rooted in service. It is a value that I
grew up with, and one of the reasons
that I chose to serve my community by
running for office.
My dad is an Air Force veteran and
has spent three decades in law enforce-
ment. In fact, he was here with us this
week as part of a large group from our
district who flew out for Police Week.
As a little girl, I remember what it
was like to wonder if my dad would
make it home at night. I remember
being so scared for his life because he
was on the front lines protecting mine
and all of the other members of our
community. I was proud of him then,
and I am proud of him now.
But unlike then, I now have the op-
portunity to fight for him and the men
and women serving just like him. Pro-
tecting and supporting our law enforce-
ment should not be partisan. The
speakers joining us today demonstrate
that we can have meaningful, legisla-
tive reform that works across the aisle.
I want to briefly touch on several
pieces of legislation that I believe will
protect and support our police officers,
including H.R. 838, the Threat Assess-
ment, Prevention, and Safety Act, or
TAPS, which institutes a process that
will identify, investigate, assess, and
mitigate threats before they happen.
Fighting for law enforcement also
means supporting legislation like H.R.
2070, the POWER Act, to develop new
grants for chemical screening; H.R.
1236, the Extreme Risk Protection
Order Act, to empower police to keep
guns out of the wrong hands; and H.R.
2379, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership,
to increase the number of lifesaving
bulletproof vests accessible to our law
enforcement. Through these bills and
others in development, we can keep our
communities and officers safe.
Most importantly, I am standing
here today to honor the life of Officer
Johnathan Tanner. He is a true public
servant from the Antelope Valley in
my district, who passed away, trag-
ically, at the age of 28 years old after
battling cancer. He will be remembered
for his steadfast devotion to his com-
munity, his church, and his family.
Officer Tanner proudly served the
California Highway Patrol with a dedi-
cation to the safety of the Antelope
Valley. In just his first year out of
training, he received the Mothers
Against Drunk Driving Award for Ex-
cellence in removing impaired drivers
from the road, and he was known for
his efforts to build public trust in law
enforcement.
Out of uniform, Officer Tanner served
his community by volunteering his
time at Lancaster Baptist Church,
where he was a lifelong member. He
taught youth ministry classes, coached
sports teams, and led a bus route that
gives children rides to church.
Officer Tanner leaves behind his wife,
Jessie, their two young sons, and a
baby girl who is expected to arrive
later this month. He is also survived by
his parents, two older brothers, and a
younger sister.
I am proud to have represented Offi-
cer Tanner, and I know that his loved
ones and the community will carry on
the legacy of his light in the world.
Today, in honor of Police Week and
in honor of all of the members of our
law enforcement community, I am
proud to stand in support of the men
and women who put their lives on the
line every single day like Officer Tan-
ner and like my dad.
Thank you for all you do.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I thank Congresswoman HILL, and I
look forward to working with her on
some of the bills she just highlighted. I
know that her law enforcement family
is proud, so I thank her.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL), my
good friend, who is from Wisconsin’s
First District.
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate Mr. RUTHERFORD putting together
tonight’s Special Order.
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize
Racine County Sheriff Deputy Eric
Schneider for his heroic actions on
March 18.
While on duty, Deputy Schneider
rushed to the scene of a house fire. He
knocked on all of the doors and win-
dows, yelling to see if anyone was in-
side.
A man came out of the house, but
without regard for his own safety, Dep-
uty Schneider entered the burning
house to check if there were more peo-
ple inside. Risking his life, he found a
man who was unconscious. Deputy
Schneider dragged him out of the house
and saved his life.
Deputy Schneider is a hero. We are
fortunate to have brave men and
women like Deputy Schneider pro-
tecting us.
Madam Speaker, I thank Deputy
Schneider. I commend him for his ac-
tions.
Madam Speaker, when law enforce-
ment officers put on their uniforms and
badges, they do not know if they will
return home after their shift. Their job
is dangerous. Too often, they sacrifice
their lives to strangers.
Over the past year, Wisconsin has
lost three police officers in the line of
duty. Those heroes died while pro-
tecting us from harm.
We will never forget them. We will
not forget their service. We will not
forget their bravery.
We remember:
Officer Charles Irvine, end of watch,
June 7, 2018;
Officer Michael Michalski, end of
watch, July 25, 2018; and
Officer Matthew Rittner, end of
watch, February 6, 2019.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman and the great
State of Wisconsin for their support of
law enforcement.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from New Mexico (Ms.
TORRES SMALL), a colleague from New
Mexico’s Second District. She serves on
the Armed Services Committee and the
Homeland Security Committee, and,
actually, after law school, worked for a
U.S. district judge in New Mexico, so
she has got that law enforcement back-
ground, also.
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to join
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle
as Americans to address this issue and
to recognize National Police Week, to
support the brave men and women who
protect and serve our communities
every day, and to honor those who paid
the ultimate sacrifice in the line of
duty.
The work you do is extraordinary,
and it makes me proud to be the grand-
daughter of a former Las Cruces police
sergeant, Angel Torres. He didn’t talk

throughout my life, I have been
stopped by people who have told me the
difference he made in their life because
he showed he cared by holding people
accountable. He was the true embodi-
ment of what it means to be a selfless
public servant, just like so many in
New Mexico and across the country.
It means something, something I will
never fully understand, to know that
every day you risk your life because of
what you do.
It means something, something I will
never understand, to know that every
day and every time you enforce the
law, you could lose your life because
you signed up to serve.
As you risk your life to treat people
with humanity, dignity, and respect,
that is superhuman. That is why, dur-
ing National Police Week and every
day, we support our law enforcement
officers and work to ensure they have
the resources they need to protect and
serve our communities.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentlewoman for the kind
words of support for our law enforce-
ment community, and I thank her for
her service earlier, as well.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON), my
good friend from Nebraska’s Second
District. He serves on our Agriculture
Committee and Armed Services Com-
mittee. He is a retired brigadier gen-
eral and did his deployment in Iraq,
and we thank him for that service.
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I thank
Mr. RUTHERFORD, a great friend and
colleague, for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize a
bipartisan issue that threatens the
safety of our law enforcement officers
and our communities in which they
serve, and we have a solution for it.
Enacted in 2004, the Law Enforce-
ment Officers Safety Act, known as
LEOSA, established clear guidelines al-
lowing experienced retired or off-duty
officers who maintain proper training
to obtain certification allowing him or
her to carry concealed firearms. The
desired purpose was to create a shared
national policy between States allow-
ing off-duty and retired officers to
carry their firearms wherever they are,
granted they are qualified and received
appropriate credentials.
As many of my colleagues know,
LEOSA has enjoyed a long history of
support from both sides of the aisle.
When it was first proposed by a Repub-
lican, LEOSA was cosponsored by more
than half of the House.
Subsequent amendments signed into
law in 2010 and 2013 under Democratic
President Barack Obama expanded
LEOSA’s coverage to include law en-
forcement officers in most Federal
agencies as well as military police. In
both instances, reforms were sponsored

LEOSA has always been a bipartisan
priority because it is a law enforce-
ment and public safety issue. It is not
a Second Amendment or gun rights
issue. The same is true about improve-
ments in H.R. 1156, the LEOSA Reform
Act, which I am sponsoring.
The LEOSA Reform Act seeks to cor-
rect a number of unintended gaps and
weaknesses in the original LEOSA bill.
These gaps and weaknesses are not due
to intentional restrictions in the origi-
nal statute. Rather, they are areas in
which the original statute is silent, re-
sulting in conflicting interpretations
and unintended restrictions which ef-
fectively limit the ability of off-duty
and retired officers to carry their fire-
arms, and we want them to do it in a
manner that is safest for them and the
public.
This lack of specific language defeats
the original intent of the law, which is
to allow off-duty and retired officers to
carry their firearms wherever they go.
Granted, they have to be qualified and
have to have received appropriate cre-
dentials. That is a given.
It also created an inconsistent imple-
mentation across States, leaving many
officers to either assume intended risk
when carrying in accord with LEOSA
or decide not to carry at all.
The LEOSA Reform Act adds specific
language to address these unintended
weaknesses, and in doing so will make
existing law stronger and more work-
able for those who seek its benefit
while maintaining the rigorous stand-
ards that currently apply.
The bill does not put more guns into
our communities. Individuals affected
by this legislation already have the au-
thority to carry concealed weapons in
most locations. Rather, H.R. 1156 will
help ensure guns that are already in
the hands of trained and certified law
enforcement officers and retired offi-
cers can safely and legally be carried
wherever they may be.
In fact, the LEOSA Reform Act will
help ensure firearms do not end up in
the hands of criminals by allowing law
enforcement officers and retired offi-
cers to keep their firearms safely on
their person, rather than being forced
to leave them unattended in vehicles in
parking lots of locations that are cur-
rently restricted from carrying.
The public’s need for rapid interven-
tion by off-duty and retired officers is
made clear by the recent incident in
California, where the heroic actions of
an off-duty Federal officer who ran and
shot at the synagogue gunman saved
countless lives. It is an example that
we see repeatedly. With the rise of
tragic shootings in our Nation, empow-
ering trained professionals to carry
will allow them to respond more quick-
ly to emergencies and provide years of
expertise to these situations.
I have heard from law enforcement
officials throughout Nebraska’s Second
District and the Nation on the impor-
tance these changes will have on the
lives of our community’s heroes and
their ability to protect themselves and
others. In fact, the LEOSA Reform Act
has been endorsed by 20 professional
law enforcement organizations whose
membership, when combined, is rep-
resentative of well over half of all law
enforcement in our country.
On National Police Week, I urge my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
join me in providing greater public
safety for law enforcement and our
communities at home by cosponsoring
the LEOSA Reform Act. Officer safety
and public safety is a bipartisan issue,
and together we must and can do bet-
ter.
Madam Speaker, I will close with
this: If I am in a situation where I am
being victimized, who do I want near
me?
I would love to have a retired or off-
duty policeman who is armed, and this
bill makes that more likely.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I am a proud cosponsor of the gentle-
man’s LEOSA bill, and having been a
law enforcement officer, I understand
exactly what the gentleman is trying
to accomplish. I support him 110 per-
cent in that effort, and I appreciate the
words.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Virginia (Ms.
SPANBERGER), who serves on the For-
eign Affairs and Agriculture Commit-
tees. She is also—I think we can say
this—a former CIA case officer.
Is it safe to say that now?
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker,
I got my deployment declassified. It is.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
the gentlewoman’s father was a career
law enforcement officer also.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman so much for the
opportunity to stand here in solidarity
with our colleagues across the aisle in
honor of Police Week and in honor of
our police officers and peace officers
across this country.
I rise today to remember the remark-
able lives of two Virginia State police
officers, one from our district in
Midlothian and one from nearby New
Kent County. They were both killed in
the line of duty.
On August 12, 2017, Lieutenant H. Jay
Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M.
Bates were not responding to an ordi-
nary call. Instead, they were flying via
helicopter to an event that became in-
famous as one of the darkest days in
modern Virginia history.
Cullen and Bates were en route to
Charlottesville to monitor the events
transpiring around the Unite the Right
white nationalist rally. Forces of hate
had gathered, and law enforcement was
called in to help end the chaos.
After police had canceled the event
as an unlawful assembly, Cullen and
Bates were instructed to assist their
fellow officers. They were to circle over
Charlottesville, and their mission was
to provide surveillance of the violence,
restore order, and help the community
end the nightmare that had transpired.
However, mid-flight, their helicopter
crashed on the outskirts of Charlottes-
ville, and both Cullen and Bates were
killed in action.
In the wake of the tragedy and the
stress of the Charlottesville protests,

H3916 May 16, 2019
Executive Director Wayne Huggins of
the Virginia State Police Association
said: ‘‘I don’t know if State police, in
its 85 years, has had a more excru-
ciating time.’’
The pain of the families of Lieuten-
ant Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Bates is
unimaginable, and the loss experienced
by the Virginia State Police and their
fellow brothers and sisters in the law
enforcement community is still felt to
this day.
This is National Police Week. We re-
member the brave and dedicated serv-
ice of Lieutenant Cullen and Trooper-
Pilot Bates. They died in an effort to
protect their fellow Virginians, and
their sacrifice will always be remem-
bered.
As a former Federal agent, the
daughter of a career law enforcement
officer, and, most respectfully, as a
grateful American and Virginian, I
thank the law enforcement officers and
peace officers who dedicate their lives
to keeping us safe. This week and every
week we stand with our law enforce-
ment officers, and we will never forget
those who laid down their lives for
their neighbors.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I want to thank my colleague from Vir-
ginia and just know that our condo-
lences go to those two officers’ fami-
lies, those heroes that you lost this
last year. God bless.
Madam Speaker, I would like to in-
troduce the Member from the great
State of Minnesota’s Eighth District,
PETE STAUBER. He serves on the Trans-
portation and Infrastructure and Small
Business Committees and was a police
officer in Duluth, Minnesota, for 23
years. I thank the gentleman for his
service.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER).
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I
thank Congressman RUTHERFORD for
yielding to me to speak today.
This week is Police Week, a time to
honor our brothers and sisters in the
blue and brown. Every day law enforce-
ment officers—local, county, State,
and Federal—walk out of their homes
leaving their loved ones behind and put
their own lives on the line for the safe-
ty and security of others. They are our
last line of defense, the protectors of
our communities, and I am so honored
to have served alongside some of these
brave men and women.
As a local law enforcement officer
with the Duluth, Minnesota, Police De-
partment for 22 years, I have seen and
experienced firsthand the violence
committed against law enforcement of-
ficers, those who are only there to up-
hold the law and improve the safety of
our communities. That is why I have
cosponsored legislation like the Thin
Blue Line Act and the Protect and
Serve Act, which hold the perpetrators
of these heinous crimes accountable.
So, now, more than ever, we must
show our support for our law enforce-
ment officers. We must make a com-
mitment to them as they have com-
mitted to our friends, our families, and
our communities. I am happy to stand
here today with so many of my col-
leagues to show our support for the
men and women in the blue and brown.
I look forward to working with them in
the 116th Congress to advance legisla-
tion that will support them, both when
they are in and out of uniform.
The men and women in law enforce-
ment deserve our respect, our admira-
tion, and our prayers and love every
single day, 365 days a year, 24 hours
every day.
I stand before you, Madam Speaker,
having done a total of 23 years in law
enforcement. I can tell you that the
men and women whom I served along-
side with, I would go into any dan-
gerous situation with them. We love
our law enforcement officers, and we
love their families.
This Congress stands ready to defend
them and their needs, their requests,
and any help they need from this Con-
gress.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I am grateful for the gentleman’s 23
years of service. I know what commit-
ment that is, and God bless him for
that.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr.
GOTTHEIMER), who is my good friend.
JOSH GOTTHEIMER is from New Jer-
sey’s Fifth District who serves on the
Financial Services Committee and
worked in both the public sector as a
White House speechwriter and in the
private industry for Ford and Micro-
soft. I thank the gentleman for being
here this evening.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker,
I want to thank Congressman RUTHER-
FORD, my good friend, and Congress-
woman HILL of California for co-
hosting this bipartisan Special Order
hour in honor of our law enforcement
officers. I am proud to serve with you
both as a member of the Congressional
Law Enforcement Caucus, co-chaired
by our friend, Congressman BILL PAS-
CRELL.
Madam Speaker, we are here today to
commemorate Police Week and to
honor all the brave law enforcement of-
ficers in New Jersey and across the
country who put their lives on the line
every day to protect our communities.
They get our backs, and we should al-
ways get theirs. There is nothing par-
tisan about that.
In 1962 President John F. Kennedy
declared May 15 to be Police Officers
Memorial Day and this week to be Po-
lice Week. Established by a joint reso-
lution of Congress in 1962, National Po-
lice Week pays special recognition to
those law enforcement officers who
have lost their lives in the line of duty
for the safety and protection of others.
Already this year, 43 police officers
have died in the line of duty across the
United States. We will never forget
their bravery, service, and sacrifice.
May God bless them and their families.
Madam Speaker, police officers are
America’s heroes, and I am so deeply
grateful to all law enforcement offi-
cers, Federal, State, and local, for what
they do day in and day out, especially
those in New Jersey’s Fifth District,
my district, and across our State.
That is why, in Congress, I am com-
mitted to fighting for all our sworn of-
ficers and first responders by making
sure that our municipalities and police
departments have the resources, equip-
ment, and training they need to do
their jobs safely and effectively. That
includes critical programs like the
COPS and JAG grants, the Bulletproof
Vest Partnership program, and the
Law Enforcement Support Office ex-
cess equipment program.
We should also support the Thin Blue
Line Act, which was referenced, be-
cause our officers rely on us to get
their backs and to make sure we give
them the resources they need to pro-
tect our families from violent crimes,
drug trafficking, domestic violence,
homegrown terrorism, and countless
other threats.
I especially want to recognize all the
men and women who took part in the
annual Police Unity Tour, riding some
300 miles to Washington in honor of our
fallen officers, and all of New Jersey’s
finest who are here in Washington this
week, including friends from the New
Jersey PBA, the New Jersey State
Troopers, the Port Authority PBA, and
many, many others.
Just yesterday I was glad to spend
some time with my friends, the Port
Authority Police and members of the
Fair Lawn Police Department Honor
Guard who came to remember those
whose names are forever inscribed at
the National Law Enforcement Officers
Memorial here on the Mall. Others
from the State PBA and PBA police of-
ficers were here this week as well. To-
gether we are all fighting to fully fund
and reauthorize the 9/11 Victim Com-
pensation Fund in memory of the 37
Port Authority police officers and
countless others whom we lost that day
and for all the injured and ill 9/11 re-
sponders and survivors whom we must
do right by today.
Madam Speaker, I thank, again, my
colleagues across the aisle who have
the backs of our first responders. But
most of all, I am grateful for every law
enforcement officer for their solemn
commitment to protect and serve. We
live in the greatest country in the
world. With our brave law enforcement
protecting our communities, we are en-
suring always that our best days are
ahead of us.
God bless our law enforcement offi-
cers and first responders, and may God
bless the United States of America.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I want to thank the gentleman from
New Jersey for having the backs of po-
lice officers who have our back, and I
thank the gentleman very much for
being here tonight to show that sup-
port for law enforcement that is so im-
portant across the country.

House Judiciary and Education and
Labor Committees. He is a lawyer and
serves as an Assistant Commonwealth
Attorney and was also chief of staff
and—I didn’t know this—chief of staff
for my good friend, Bob Goodlatte, who
is one of my heroes from Congress.
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank
Congressman RUTHERFORD for yielding
and putting together this event this
evening.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the men and women in law en-
forcement who serve our communities,
States, and Nation with honor and
bravery. These are our friends and
neighbors who willingly face danger in
order to protect their fellow man and
make our cities better places in which
to live.
Just this week in Lynchburg, Vir-
ginia, I joined several hundred with the
police chief, mayor, and members of
law enforcement from around the re-
gion to honor the lives of two law en-
forcement officers who made the ulti-
mate sacrifice in the last year.
b 2030
Virginia State Trooper Lucas Dowell,
who was shot while serving a search
warrant, was only 28.
Winchester Police Department Offi-
cer Hunter Edwards, who died in a ve-
hicle collision while responding to a
fight in Winchester, was only 30.
As this week draws to a close, I ask
that all Americans remember the more
than 150 officers this year who died in
the line of duty and consider the dan-
ger that all officers face each day in
order to keep Americans safe.
Your lives are a shining example of
what is right in our world. By getting
up each day and donning a uniform and
badge, you are making a difference in
our communities across this great Na-
tion. Every single day, you have our
gratitude.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman from Virginia.
In particular, I want to offer, again,
our condolences to those officers, those
heroes from Virginia, who gave their
lives in service.
Madam Speaker, I would like to rec-
ognize Representative CLAY HIGGINS
from the great State of Louisiana,
their Third District. He was a National
Guard military police officer for many
years, a SWAT operator. I am sure he
will have some great words for us.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS).
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize
American men and women who put on
a badge every day, men and women of
every color and creed, ethnicity, herit-
age, and background, of varied ideology
and political affiliation. They are
American patriots, one and all.
As a police officer, our job begins
with an oath. That oath is not to a
chief or a sheriff or a marshal. It is to
the constitutional principles that rep-
resent the badges that we wear, badges
like this.
In this body, we stand within the peo-
ple’s House. We serve within the pa-
rameters of our ability. We wear a
small pin upon our lapel to designate
our status as Congressmen and Con-
gresswomen.
In humble service and an honor, yes,
it is. But forget not, America, the men
and women in your community, un-
seen, unheard, far too frequently
unappreciated and unrecognized, who
patrol your streets, your neighbor-
hoods, your counties, your States, and
the parishes in my State of Louisiana.
For they serve unknowing if they
shall return home. They do so will-
ingly. They place great faith in their
Lord. The Word tells us that the Lord
is my strength and my shield.
In many ways, we should recall that
this small shield that we wear begins
with faith, that this Chamber began
with faith, and that the shield that of-
ficers wear from sea to shining sea
maintains itself by faith.
This week, we honor the Thin Blue
Line. You are known. You are loved.
You are recognized. We honor you.
Madam Speaker, I thank the sheriff
for allowing me to speak.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
I thank my good friend from Louisiana
for all his service those many years.
I would like to recognize, again, my
cohost for tonight, Representative
KATIE HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield to
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
HILL).
Ms. HILL of California. Madam
Speaker, I wanted to finish out by
thanking the 2,200 Capitol Police offi-
cers here who protect us and the 3 to 5
million people who visit the U.S. Cap-
itol every single year.
They do the job that often goes unno-
ticed, but we are ensured our safety
and protection, and that of every single
person who comes to visit us, because
of their hard work and service.
To every single law enforcement pro-
fessional who dedicates their life every
single day, we are eternally grateful. I
am so proud to be working with my
colleagues to continue to fight for rec-
ognizing our officers and to take this
forward for many years to come.
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
it has been an honor to be here with
the gentlewoman tonight to recognize
our law enforcement community.
Madam Speaker, I will close with
this. It is from Ralph Waldo Emerson.
He said:
The purpose in life is not to be happy. It is
to be useful, to be honorable, to be compas-
sionate, to have it make some difference
that you have lived and lived well.
Madam Speaker, the 158 lives that we
honor tonight, all the thousands of law
enforcement officers serving this mo-
ment, they live well. For that, we are
grateful.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
ENSURE FULL PROTECTION FOR
LGBTQ COMMUNITY THROUGH
THE EQUALITY ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) is recognized for
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to uplift my LGBTQ neighbors at
home in the 13th Congressional Dis-
trict. I want them to know that I uplift
them today, and always, as their un-
wavering advocate in the United States
Congress.
There are ideals and values we all
should attempt to live up to in this
country. I know many of us ran to be
in this Chamber to ensure that our
laws match those values and ideals as
well.
When I think of these issues we con-
front as people and as a representative
body, I always feel that we must use an
approach that is rooted in values that
uplift our whole communities. The val-
ues of equality, justice, and acceptance
come to mind when I think of the need
to pass the Equality Act.
Far too long, our LGBTQ neighbors
have been forced to live a life of fear, a
life in hiding, a life of oppression, and
a life of instability.
We have come a long way in the
LGBTQ rights community, but we have
a long way to go. The Equality Act is
a step in the right direction on this im-
portant path toward justice.
I think of the right side of history,
when the right to marriage was af-
forded to same-sex couples, the mo-
ment when our LGBTQ neighbors in
Michigan were able to create that spe-
cial bond with their loved ones.
But I am also reminded of the stark
reality that they faced being in States
where they could still be fired from
their jobs the day after their wedding
for being gay.
I think of the trans community
across the country that still faces dis-
crimination and violence, especially
trans women of color who are dis-
proportionately targeted and killed.
Our laws still do not protect them.
LGBTQ Americans remain vulnerable
to discrimination on a daily basis and,
too often, have little recourse. Fifty
percent of the national LGBTQ com-
munity live in States where, though
they have the right to marry, they still
have no explicit nondiscrimination
practices in other areas of their daily
life.
One’s identity could still mean deep
harm and even death for some commu-
nities in this country, and we must
change this.
I think of our LGBTQ neighbors who
are denied public accommodation just
because of who they are and whom
they love. I think about how we are
failing them by not living out our val-
ues rooted in justice.
This week, we have a chance to begin
to change with the Equality Act. We
now have a pro-equality majority,

H3918 May 16, 2019
Madam Speaker, in this Chamber, and
I am so glad we can change the fact
that LGBTQ folks are being denied
housing, services, and employment in
the majority of our States.
I am so glad to be part of ensuring
that everyone has full protection in
our civil rights laws, regardless of who
they are and whom they love.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from the great State of Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY), my col-
league.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of H.R. 5, the
Equality Act.
I rise on behalf of non-cisgender
Americans, on behalf of QPOC Ameri-
cans, on behalf of drag kings and drag
queens, on behalf of all non-
heteronormative Americans.
I rise today to let you know that you
are seen and you are heard, and I am
proud to stand in solidarity with you.
It is our mandate as legislators to
protect all Americans, yet we are fail-
ing entire communities. In my home
State, the Commonwealth of Massa-
chusetts, a leader in marriage equality,
we have the second largest LGBTQ pop-
ulation of any State in the country.
Even though our queer pride extends
far and wide, 61 percent of transgender
Bay Staters experienced housing dis-
crimination in the greater Boston area,
and 65 percent of LGBTQ Bay Staters
experienced discrimination in public
spaces, from public transportation to
retail establishments, places of wor-
ship, restaurants, and healthcare set-
tings.
As we consider H.R. 5, we must re-
mind ourselves of our values. My for-
ever President Barack Obama once
said: ‘‘When all Americans are treated
as equal, no matter who they are or
whom they love, we are all more free.’’
It is true. When we defeat hate with
love, we all win.
During a time filled with fear, big-
otry, and public turmoil, it is uncon-
scionable that we are still debating the
liberties of people who ask only to be
received as their full selves. It is our
fundamental right as Americans to live
happily, peacefully, and
unapologetically. It is our fundamental
right to live free of harassment and
discrimination. It is our right to pur-
sue happiness.
I extend my deepest gratitude to
Congressman CICILLINE, the author of
the Equality Act who has worked tire-
lessly for years to affirm the rights and
liberties of LGBTQ Americans.
Thanks to the leadership, H.R. 5
takes a comprehensive approach to
making the pursuit of life, love, and
happiness a reality for all of us, regard-
less of sexual orientation or gender
identity. The Equality Act ensures
that LGBTQ people are protected by a
nationwide standard for nondiscrimina-
tion.
It is time for us to live up to our val-
ues. It is time for us to strike out
against injustices that devalue our hu-
manity.
Together, we can affirm that our di-
versity is our strength and that our
collective safety is nonnegotiable.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support of H.R. 5.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I also
would love to recognize the fact—it is
pretty historic—that Madam Speaker
who is presiding over this Chamber
right now is a member of our beautiful
community, of the LGBTQ community.
That, to me, is pretty historic as we
now are debating and putting forward
the Equality Act. That is Congress-
woman ANGIE CRAIG.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN), my
colleague.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing.
Before getting into my message, I
would like to acknowledge that I am
an ally of the LGBTQ community. I do
this and announce my support for H.R.
5 because of a debt I owe.
I haven’t always had the privileges
that I enjoy now. Someone stood and
suffered so that I could come in the
front door of, probably, this very facil-
ity. Someone suffered so that I would
have the opportunity to go to some of
the schools that I attended.
I believe that there is reciprocity in
life and that you don’t get where you
are and fail to appreciate those who
have suffered so that you could have
the opportunities that you enjoy.
I support H.R. 5 for a multiplicity of
reasons, the least of which is not the
fact that I am repaying a debt. I am
going to help make sure that others
don’t endure the pain and suffering
that I endured and that my prede-
cessors endured. No one should be pun-
ished or treated with disrespect be-
cause of how you look or who you are.
b 2045
Every person’s dignity is given to
them from a higher authority, and we
all should respect the dignity and hu-
manity of every individual. So I sup-
port H.R. 5, and I do so proudly because
of a debt I owe.
I thank my friends for bringing this
to my attention. It was not to be a part
of my message this evening, but it is a
part of my life, to make sure others are
treated properly.
Madam Speaker, and still I rise to-
night to address a crisis that our coun-
try finds itself engulfed in, a crisis
that, if we are not very careful, will
cause the Congress of the United
States to be seen as a ‘‘less than’’ when
it comes to the coequals that it is sup-
posed to be on the same plane with.
This crisis is a constitutional crisis.
And while there are some who would
differ with me and say that this is not
a constitutional crisis, remember this:
There is no hard and fast definition of
what a constitutional crisis is, so
whenever I give my thoughts or some-
one else gives their thoughts, we are
giving opinions.
Tonight, I would like to share my
opinion about this constitutional cri-
sis. Remember, all of these thoughts
are opinions; just as the thoughts of
persons who hold themselves out to be
constitutional scholars, they are opin-
ions.
There are some who say that you
don’t have a constitutional crisis in
the circumstance that we are dealing
with with the President, who has re-
fused to honor subpoenas by and
through his various administrators.
There are some who say that this
will not be a constitutional crisis until
the case gets to the Supreme Court,
and the Supreme Court has to rule on
whether or not the subpoena must be
honored. And if the Supreme Court
rules that the subpoena must be hon-
ored, and then the members of the ad-
ministration refuse to obey the Su-
preme Court, there are persons who
conclude that this, now, is a constitu-
tional crisis.
I would conclude that if the Presi-
dent of the United States fails to honor
a subpoena, after having been so or-
dered by the Judiciary, that this is
more than a constitutional crisis; you
now have a constitutional collapse.
The crisis occurs when the President
is at odds, meaning the executive
branch, with the legislative branch;
and currently, the legislative branch
and the executive branch are at a stale-
mate.
The executive branch is declining to
cooperate, declining to allow the legis-
lative branch to fulfill its constitu-
tional responsibilities associated with
oversight and investigation. And, as
such, there is a crisis, and that crisis,
clearly, is rooted in the Constitution,
because the legislative branch has this
responsibility pursuant to the Con-
stitution.
So this is a constitutional crisis, and
we have a duty to address it, and we
must do so, or we will have failed on
our watch to take up our responsibil-
ities as Members of Congress.
This is our watch, and we have a re-
sponsibility to make sure that this
House takes its proper place in the an-
nals of history, with reference to the
question of impeachment.
Impeachment is something that we
should not take lightly; but it is also
something that we have to take seri-
ously, and we have to take it seriously
because, if we fail to do so, we will
have allowed this august body to be-
come minimized.
You see, there are checks and bal-
ances in the system. The check on the
executive branch is impeachment. That
is the check. That is the sword of Dam-
ocles that hangs above the head of the
executive. And if we fail to exercise
this duty when it properly should be,
we, then, do not provide the checks to
make sure the balance of power re-
mains as it should be.
I fear for what is happening to this
Congress. I am gravely concerned be-
cause I don’t see us aggressively pur-
suing the checks so as to make sure
the balance of power remains in place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3919
May 16, 2019
Checks and balances are in place to
make sure that there is no concentra-
tion of power in any branch of govern-
ment. If we don’t become the last line
of defense with reference to the Presi-
dent, if we fail to do so, we then say
that there are no guardrails; that there
are no rules that the President has to
obey. He doesn’t become just another
president. He metamorphoses into a
monarch.
The Framers never intended for us to
have a monarchy. The Framers in-
tended for the President to be checked
by the Congress.
My hope is that we, in this Congress,
will take up our responsibilities, and
we will provide the checks necessary to
make sure that this President, and no
other President, is above the law.
I hear many Members of Congress say
that the President is not above the
law. No one is above the law. And they
go on to say, however, this President,
notwithstanding his actions, we should
not impeach.
How can we say that he has com-
mitted impeachable acts, and then con-
clude that he should not be impeached?
We, literally, are saying he is above the
law when we say that he has com-
mitted impeachable acts, but then de-
cline to impeach.
Anyone else breaking the law will
have to answer to the bar of justice, ex-
cept the President. We know that he
has done it. The Mueller report is re-
plete with examples, yet we have not
exercised our constitutional respon-
sibilities and, as a result, we, the Con-
gress of the United States of America,
are allowing the President to be above
the law.
This is unacceptable. I refuse to
allow this to continue. And I say, as I
have said, that the President will have
to come before the bar of justice, which
is the House of Representatives. If we
fail to do so, we will have literally al-
lowed him to be above the law. Not in
this country, and not on my watch.
I take my oath seriously, and I as-
sure you that this will not be the final
word; that the President is not im-
peachable, because he is, and we will
have to have a vote on it.
Tomorrow will be the second anniver-
sary of the date that we initially called
for the President’s impeachment. I be-
lieve that we cannot have another an-
niversary without another vote.
There will be one. My hope is that it
will come through the appropriate
committees of the House of Represent-
atives. But, if not, it will come. And I
don’t know that there will be others
who will vote to impeach him, but I do
know that I will.
And there are times when you may
have to stand alone; but I know that it
is better to stand alone than not stand
at all.
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for
the time that I have had. I thank you
all for allowing it to take place, and I
assure you, I love my country, and I
only speak these words because I see a
country in peril because of a reckless,
ruthless, lawless President that we are
allowing to be above the law.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from New Mexico
(Ms. HAALAND).
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of the Equality
Act. America must live up to its values
by treating everyone as equals and end-
ing discrimination once and for all.
The Equality Act is about making
sure all Americans, regardless of sexual
orientation or gender identity, can par-
ticipate in our society without fear.
New Mexico is home to diverse reli-
gious and traditional communities and
has stood up for its LGBTQ population
for a very long time. The Equality Act
allows us to adhere to our faiths, while
prohibiting harmful and isolating acts
of discrimination against the LGBTQ
community.
No one should have to worry about
being discriminated against when
interviewing for a job or struggling to
find a healthcare provider that will
treat them.
Tomorrow morning, when I vote for
the Equality Act, I will be proud to
stand with my colleagues, with New
Mexicans, and with my daughter, who
is a proud LGBTQ American. The time
for equality is now, and we must pass
the Equality Act to live up to our val-
ues.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from California
(Ms. PORTER).
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, de-
spite the enactment of marriage equal-
ity in 2015, same-gender couples con-
tinue to experience persistent and per-
vasive discrimination when it comes to
home ownership.
A recent study by Iowa State Univer-
sity found systemic discrimination
against LGBTQ borrowers. The study
found that, despite having a lower
credit risk overall, same-sex borrowers
are 73 percent more likely to be denied
a mortgage loan. And when they are
approved, they face mortgage interest
rates that are 0.02 to 0.2 percent higher,
on average, translating to tens of thou-
sands of dollars in extra repayment.
Twenty-six States across the United
States do not have statewide housing
protections for the LGBTQ community,
and the Fair Housing Act does not pro-
tect lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender individuals. The Equality
Act would change this.
This bill would not only improve the
lives of members of the LGBTQ com-
munity, it would make neighborhoods
across the country more diverse. And
making our neighborhoods more di-
verse means more Americans get to
know and understand their neighbors
who are gay, trans, or queer; and with
that understanding and the friendships
and the neighbor relationships, we
hope to get tolerance. This is how we
magnify the wave of LGBTQ accept-
ance this country has experienced in
the last decade.
Imagine growing up in a community
where you never have any LGBTQ role
models; where students in your school
were harassed for even being perceived
as gay.
Imagine growing up in a neighbor-
hood where you never met someone
who expressed themselves like you;
where you were taught that your sex-
ual orientation or gender identity was
wrong or immoral.
Imagine what it would be like to
have waited years for your country to
recognize your loving relationship as
legal and equal under the law. Now,
you are finally able to get married, and
if you choose to, start a family.
You have saved enough money for
the downpayment on your first home.
You find that dream house in an area
with good schools, plenty of parks for
your dogs, and friendly neighbors.
You and your spouse go together to
fill out a loan application at the local
bank and wait eagerly for it to be
granted. However, despite doing every-
thing right, you are outright denied for
that loan without reason.
You go to another bank, assuming
that this is a mistake, because both
you and your spouse have great credit.
You apply for a mortgage loan again.
Maybe this time you are approved,
but the interest rate would amount to
tens of thousands more dollars than
you had anticipated; tens of thousands
more dollars than your credit risk
should have you pay.
You found your dream home, but now
you can’t buy it because of an artifi-
cially, discriminatorily-inflated inter-
est rate.
b 2100
The Equality Act is vital. By amend-
ing existing civil rights laws to explic-
itly include sexual orientation and gen-
der identity as protected characteris-
tics, no person may be lawfully dis-
criminated against for their sexual ori-
entation and gender identity in hous-
ing, education, employment, public ac-
commodations, and so much more.
Not only would it protect LGBTQ
families who want to buy a home or
take out a loan, but it would allow in-
dividuals who identify as gay or trans
or queer to see people who look and
love like them in their communities,
and it would allow their neighbors to
see that LGBTQ families are like them:
They care about their neighborhoods;
they care about their communities;
they love and want the best for their
children like anyone else; and they
take the same pride in home owner-
ship.
Injustice anywhere is a threat to jus-
tice everywhere, and discrimination
against the LGBTQ community is a
deep injustice. Allowing that discrimi-
nation to continue in our country flies
in the face of the principles of equality
and opportunity that form the basis of
our democracy.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port the Equality Act, and I urge my

colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
do the same.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin
(Ms. MOORE).
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I want
to thank the gentlewoman from De-
troit, Michigan, for yielding time to
me.
Madam Speaker, you heard it just a
moment ago, those words from the
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.:
‘‘Injustice anywhere is injustice every-
where.’’ That is why I am so proud to
support this historic legislation that
will be on this floor tomorrow, H.R. 5,
the Equality Act, that will truly pro-
vide equality for members of the
LGBTQ community.
Now, many people might argue,
Madam Speaker, that we have made
important strides against prejudice
over the last few years, and it has been
amazing. We have had States pass leg-
islation outlawing discrimination
based on a person’s sexual orientation.
Likewise, we have had Federal courts
that have ruled that discrimination
based on someone’s sexual orientation
or gender identity is illegal under ex-
isting laws. Yet tens of millions of
Americans live in areas where these
laws have not been passed and Federal
courts have not made the same deter-
mination.
H.R. 5 is the remedy for making sure
that we don’t have this checkerboard
of rights and checkerboard of discrimi-
nation among our LGBTQ community.
My district of Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
the Fourth Congressional District of
Wisconsin, is notable to mention here.
LGBTQ youth, in particular, face sig-
nificant obstacles and barriers because
of their LGBTQ identification.
We have 500 youth in my district who
are homeless, and more than 40 percent
of them identify as LGBTQ, many per-
manently homeless because they have
been abandoned by their families and
turned out onto the streets.
To add to their distress, the overly
represented LGBTQ youth in the foster
care system in Milwaukee and around
the country face huge disparities in
treatment and higher rates of harass-
ment than their non-LGBTQ peers.
There are many foster care organiza-
tions that are turning away potential
loving families and homes based on dis-
criminatory practices even though
LGBTQ couples are seven times—did
you hear me, Madam Speaker?—seven
times as likely to adopt and are more
likely to adopt minority children or
disabled children as compared to het-
erosexual couples.
Here is what we know. Every child
wants a loving home. Trans people,
like all people, just want to be treated
like people.
For these reasons, and so many oth-
ers, I fully support H.R. 5, and I look
forward to voting for it tomorrow.
I applaud our leadership’s commit-
ment to protecting our LGBTQ com-
munity and all communities from per-
nicious forms of hate and harm of dis-
crimination.
We are all in this together, Madam
Speaker. And in order to protect all of
our rights, we ought to remember the
oath that we take as we stand under
this ‘‘e pluribus unum’’—‘‘out of many,
one.’’
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, the
Congressional Progressive Caucus, who
puts this Special Order together every
week, has truly been committed to the
rights of our LGBTQ neighbors, and I
am very pleased that many of my col-
leagues tomorrow, in a very bipartisan
way, are going to be supporting a his-
toric, historic bill: the Equality Act.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
f
IMMIGRATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker,
first of all, I would like to thank Presi-
dent Trump for earlier today, one more
time, bringing the issue of immigra-
tion to the forefront. I think President
Trump’s speech was an interesting
speech and provided a nice starting
point for the immigration discussion
ahead.
I would like to highlight three issues
that I hope the President will consider
as we move forth on some sort of com-
promise on this problem.
The first issue that I really wish
President Trump would have addressed
today, but I am sure he will address in
the future because he has dealt with it
in the past, is birthright citizenship.
If we are going to get control over
who is in this country, we cannot allow
the continuation of something which
was certainly not intended by the Con-
stitution, and that is something called
birth tourism. I know somebody from
California, and they see, on a regular
basis, people coming to California to
have a child here.
Now, I know in the future we want to
vet our future immigrants. We want to
perhaps have a balance between dif-
ferent countries. We want to make sure
that the immigrants who are coming
here learn English, the people who are
coming here are going to be hard-
working people and not become a pub-
lic charge.
Under current law, the United States
interprets, wrongly, the 14th Amend-
ment of the Constitution as requiring
that, if someone is born here, they will
become a citizen here. That, of course,
was not the intent of the Amendment,
and President Trump, I know, knows it
was not the intent of the Amendment.
The 14th Amendment of the United
States Constitution was solely put in
for the purpose of making sure that
slaves who were born in the country
prior to the Emancipation Proclama-
tion would become citizens. There was
a fear at the time that some unethical,
particularly Southern, States would
say that people who were not citizens
prior to the Civil War were not citizens
after the Civil War.
Obviously, that Amendment was not
designed to say somebody who was a
tourist here, somebody who was here
illegally or whatever, if they had a
child, that that child would become a
citizen.
It is time that President Trump do
what he talked about doing in Novem-
ber and October, and I applaud him
when he will do it, and that he get rid
of the birthright citizenship. I think he
can do this as President by himself,
though it would be nice if Congress
would pass such a law.
Right now in this country, we esti-
mate that 7.5 percent of the births in
this country are births of people who
are here illegally. There are a variety
of problems with that.
First of all, it encourages illegal im-
migration, in part because, once some-
body is a citizen, under the family laws
that we have right now in the United
States, the parents, perhaps the sib-
lings, will eventually become citizens
outside of the way we want to pick our
future citizens and make sure that
they are appropriately vetted.
Now, we know that there are, I call
them devious one worlders on both
sides of the aisle who will fight this.
The reason this has remained a prac-
tice in the United States for several
decades is, unfortunately, perhaps even
Republican Presidents, for whatever
reason, did not want to have our immi-
gration laws be treated seriously.
But I do call upon President Trump
to stop this policy. I think it is impor-
tant not only to discourage illegal im-
migration, but I do not think right now
that, when people come here on work
visas, it is the intent of Congress that
these people’s children will automati-
cally become citizens.
I think we want to stop the excessive
policy of chain migration which fol-
lows, as then the parents who broke
the law when they came into this coun-
try would be able to turn around and
become citizens themselves, kind of a
reward for breaking the law.
So I hope as this immigration law
moves through the process and Presi-
dent Trump fine-tunes things, he does
what we were all so happy to hear him
say he would do last October, and that
is end birthright citizenship.
The next thing I think we want to
look at is the idea of public benefits for
illegal immigrants. First of all, under
current law, you are not hypo-
thetically supposed to get public bene-
fits if you are here illegally.
I would like to thank Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Carson
for stepping to the plate and making
sure that people who broke the law to
come here do not take advantage of our
generous low-income housing benefits.
However, we should go beyond that.
We should pass a bill saying, outright,
that public benefits are not things that
we should give to anybody who is not a
citizen.
First of all, we are broke. I don’t
think it has been publicized enough,

but about 20 percent of the current
Federal spending is borrowed. When
you are around $23 trillion in debt, the
idea of providing generous public bene-
fits to people who are not citizens is
preposterous.
Secondly, insofar as efforts are made
to increase our citizenship through
things like DACA, we do want to make
sure that we are not collecting immi-
grants who are eventually, themselves,
going to become a public charge or
coming here because of our generosity
rather than the opportunities that
take place for people who work hard.
I have introduced legislation which
will say that any local unit of govern-
ment that gives benefits to people who
are not citizens will lose its ability to
give those benefits, because we have to
crack down on this. Otherwise, the fu-
ture generations of Americans will no
longer be like past generations who
came here to take advantage of the op-
portunity to get through hard work,
but we will begin to get some people
here who will take advantage of the op-
portunities that are available from
government benefits.
I hope President Trump, as he con-
tinues to discuss this immigration sit-
uation, talks about this.
The third thing I think he should
talk about, and something that I don’t
think the mainstream media has high-
lighted enough, is what we are going to
be spending money on in the next budg-
et.
So the viewers back home are aware,
when we pass our annual spending
bills, we break it into 12 separate bills.
Now, right now, as we have 100,000
people a month crossing our border il-
legally, I would say that it is probably
the number one concern for the future
of the United States.
Sadly, the majority party, as they let
us know where their priorities lie, told
us the percentage of increases in each
one of these 12 bills. For example,
Labor and HHS was due for a 6 percent
increase; Defense for a 3 percent in-
crease; State and Foreign Ops, a 5 per-
cent increase; the Legislative Branch, I
think, about a 3 percent increase.
Who came along in last place at 1
percent? Homeland Security. In other
words, a sign that the least priority in
the next budget should be enforcing
our borders, this at a time where
groups estimate the cost of illegal im-
migration to our country to be between
$50 billion and $100 billion.
Not to mention, when we talk about
the moral fiber of America, which has
kept us going for so long, we begin to
have the next wave of immigrants, who
will become the next wave of Ameri-
cans, whose first action coming to this
country is breaking the law.
b 2115
I want to point out that neither I nor
President Trump is anti-immigrant. I
think it is tremendous that every year
in this country we swear in another
700,000 citizens. I think it is wonderful
in this country that we have 4 million
people here on work visas, and it is
possible that number will go up in the
future.
But there is a difference between peo-
ple coming here on work visas; there is
a difference between people going
through the appropriate steps and get-
ting sworn in legally and people who
are crossing the border illegally.
These are three suggestions of things
that I would think would be minimal
requirements before an immigration
compromise is reached.
Again, I emphasize we should get rid
of birth right citizenship. The idea of
people flying here from other countries
or crossing the Rio Grande and saying
‘‘my child automatically becomes a
citizen’’ must end.
I think the practice of having people
who are here illegally or anybody who
is here who is not a citizen getting pub-
lic benefits—and frequently those pub-
lic benefits, particularly in the area of
healthcare, are superior benefits to
those which the average working
American has. As a matter of fact, fre-
quently, public housing today is supe-
rior to some of the housing that people
who have to pay their own rent can af-
ford. But I hope we step up to the plate
and make sure that, with regard to im-
migration, there are no public benefits.
And finally, with so many people
flooding across the border, I hope we
aggressively fight the idea that the
least important part of our upcoming
appropriations bills is Homeland Secu-
rity.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Let us pray.
Redeemer and friend, the fountain of
wisdom and strength, we borrow our
heartbeats from You. Today, guide our
Senators to new heights of achieve-
ment, providing them with robust
health, faith for their perplexities, and
light for the path ahead.
Lord, give them fulfillment as they
strive to be instruments of Your provi-
dence. Supply their needs according to
Your riches in glory, giving them the
serenity to accept what can’t be
changed, the courage to change what
they can, and the wisdom to know one
from the other. Bring them to the end
of this day with satisfied hearts and
clear consciences.
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.

NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
yesterday the Senate voted to confirm
Kenneth Lee of California to serve as a
U.S. circuit court judge for the Ninth
Circuit. Yet another well-qualified
nominee will now bring impressive
legal experience and fine academic cre-
dentials to the job of upholding the
rule of law as a Federal judge.
Mr. Lee is far from the only nominee
to an important position whom the
Senate confirmed this week.
On Tuesday we confirmed Michael
Truncale of Texas to the Federal bench
in the Eastern District of Texas, and
today we will consider three more of
the President’s abundantly qualified
picks to fill vacancies in the executive
branch and in the judiciary.
First, we will vote on Wendy Vitter
of Louisiana, who has been nominated
to be a U.S. district court judge for the
Eastern District of Louisiana. Ms.
Vitter’s impressive legal career in-
cludes experience in private practice
and a decade in the Orleans Parish Dis-
trict Attorney’s Office, where she han-
dled more than 100 felony jury trials.
Ms. Vitter has been favorably reported
twice by our colleagues on the Judici-
ary Committee. I would urge every one
of our colleagues to vote to confirm her
today.
Following the Vitter nomination, we
will turn to Brian Bulatao, nominated
to serve as Under Secretary of State
for Management. As I have mentioned,
the job description is essentially that
of chief operating officer at the State
Department, ensuring that tens of
thousands of diplomats, civil servants,
and staff are provided for and a host of
important missions around the world
can actually be carried out.
Fortunately, we have a strong nomi-
nee who is up to the task. Mr. Bulatao
is a graduate of West Point and Har-
vard Business School. After service in
the Army, he founded a business and
worked in financial management be-
fore entering public service as chief op-
erating officer at the CIA.
In Chairman RISCH’s assessment, he
is ‘‘eminently qualified.’’ Our col-
leagues on the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee certainly agree, having favor-
ably reported his nomination with no
opposition.
It has been 11 long months since the
Senate first received his nomination—
11 months. I am glad that today we will
finally be able to put partisan delay be-
hind us and get the nominee confirmed.
Finally, the Senate will vote today
on the nomination of Jeffrey Rosen to
serve as Deputy Attorney General. As I
have discussed earlier in the week, the
President has chosen a nominee with a
rock-solid legal reputation who served
with distinction as the Deputy Sec-
retary of Transportation and who
would be a clear asset to the Depart-
ment of Justice and to the Nation in
this new capacity.
So I would urge my colleagues to join
me in voting to confirm each of these
three well-qualified nominees for Fed-
eral service.
f
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on another matter, this week I have
been discussing the stark contrast be-
tween the remarkable opportunity
economy that Republican policies have
helped to unlock for the middle class
and my Democratic colleagues’ hard
turn toward far-left ideas that would
stifle all the progress. Our colleagues
across the aisle, particularly over in
the House, have given top billing to the
legislation that would end Medicare as
seniors know it, eliminate every pri-
vate healthcare plan American families
have chosen to meet their needs, and
replace all of it—all of it—with a one-
size-fits-all, government-run insurance
system while piling heavy taxes on the
middle class. And, of course, they have
touted a proposal to drop an anvil—an
anvil—on a high-speed U.S. economy
and shove a host of new Federal rules
between American citizens and their
everyday life choices—all in the name
of going ‘‘green.’’
Now, most of my colleagues across
the aisle know full well what would
happen if the supposed Green New Deal
actually became reality. They know
what winding down our affordable
forms of domestic energy and the mil-
lions of jobs that support their produc-
tion would do to a U.S. economy that
is currently firing on all cylinders.
They know what turning families’ own
choices about where to live, what to
drive, and how to make a living into
Washington, DC’s official business
would mean for the historic levels of
job opportunities and the wage growth
that we have seen over the past 2 years.
All of that would come to a screeching
halt.
Remember, our Democratic col-
leagues tried to claim this outlandish
proposal—this truly outlandish pro-
posal—was just a conversation starter
from the farthest left fringes. But,
then, push came to shove. Then, the

S2896 May 16, 2019
American people really saw the score
because we brought the thing up for a
vote. Right here on this floor we had
the vote, and only 4 out of 47 Senate
Democrats actually voted no. Only 4 of
the 47 voted against this plan to bring
our economy to a screeching halt.
Forty-three of our Democratic col-
leagues couldn’t bring themselves—
couldn’t bring themselves—to vote
even against this—not even as Repub-
lican policies, taking the exact oppo-
site approach, have helped the U.S. job
market to drive unemployment lower
than it has been in half a century—
lower than it has been in half a cen-
tury. They want to bring all of that to
a screeching halt—not even as 19 dif-
ferent States have hit new record low
State unemployment rates in just the
year and a half since Republicans
passed comprehensive tax reform.
Well, I have good news for the Amer-
ican people. This Republican majority
is going to keep fighting for you. We
will not let these far-left dreams get in
the way of more progress for middle-
class families.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, this
week is National Police Week—a
chance to reflect on the sacrifices of
our Nation’s police officers and to
thank them for everything they do on
our behalf.
Yesterday, I spoke on the floor about
Military Appreciation Month. Like
members of the military, police offi-
cers are a special breed. They willingly
rush into danger and put their lives on
the line for the rest of us. That is not
a natural human instinct, to rush into
danger. Most of us are inclined to run
away from danger. But police officers
do the opposite. They not only stand
their ground in the face of danger; they
walk into the midst of it to protect the
rest of us.
A centerpiece of National Police
Week is Peace Officers Memorial Day,
which commemorates the sacrifices of
all of those who have given their lives
in the line of duty. Last year, more
than 100 police officers were killed in
the line of duty. It is a powerful re-
minder that being a police officer is a
dangerous job. USA TODAY reports
that 10 percent of police officers are as-
saulted every year—10 percent. Police
officers never know what they are
going to face when they respond to a
call, but they go in anyway.
Serving in law enforcement can take
a toll. Police officers—particularly
those who specialize in investigating
and responding to the worst crimes—
have to see a lot of evil on a daily
basis. It is yet another way they pro-
tect the rest of us. They face evil so
that we don’t have to. Yet, despite all
they do, they don’t line up to be
thanked. The police officers I meet
tend to minimize their contributions.
‘‘I am just doing my job’’ is a pretty
frequent refrain.
A lot of us don’t interact with the po-
lice very frequently. We don’t often see
the work they do to keep our towns
and our cities safe. But being in Con-
gress has given me a chance to interact
with police officers on a daily basis.
The U.S. Capitol Building and the con-
gressional office buildings, where I
work, are protected by the men and
women of the U.S. Capitol Police. I see
them every day, manning security
checkpoints, directing traffic, standing
on guard outside in the blazing Sun or
the cold rain, responding to incidents,
and protecting dignitaries and visitors.
I know there is a lot they do that I
don’t see, too—the countless things
that go into keeping the Capitol Com-
plex and the thousands of people who
work and visit here safe from threats.
I was in the Longworth House Office
Building on September 11, 2001, when
the planes hit the Pentagon and the
Twin Towers. Once it became clear
that our Nation was, in fact, under at-
tack, the entire Capitol Complex was
evacuated. People were rushing, run-
ning out of the buildings. Do you know
who wasn’t running? The Capitol Po-
lice. They weren’t going anywhere
until they were sure that all of us had
gotten out.
Since I became whip, I have gotten to
know a number of the outstanding
plainclothes police officers who protect
Members of leadership. It was two
members of the Capitol Police security
detail who stepped into the line of fire
at the Republicans’ baseball practice
two summers ago and prevented a ter-
rible day from becoming much worse.
Many Members of Congress are safe
today because of the actions of those
two police officers.
Here in the United States, we are
blessed with a peace and a safety that
is denied to many around the world. It
is important to remember that one of
the big reasons most of us are able to
live free from fear is because of the
countless police officers on duty
around our country. They are there 24
hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a
year, ready to step between us and dan-
ger. We owe these dedicated men and
women a very great debt.
As we observe Police Week, I want to
say thank you. Thank you to the police
officers who serve across our country.
Thank you to their families, who also
sacrifice so that the rest of us can live
in safety. A special thank-you to the
Capitol Police and the police officers
who keep the peace back home in
South Dakota. May God bless each of
you.
I yield the floor.

ator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NOMINATIONS
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I
come to the floor again this morning to
discuss several judicial nominations
considered by the Senate this week.
Earlier this week, the Senate voted
to confirm Michael Truncale to the
Eastern District of Texas and Kenneth
Lee to the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals seat in California, and today we
will be voting on the nomination of
Wendy Vitter to the Eastern District of
Louisiana.
The Senate is considering and con-
firming nominees whose records indi-
cate they are far outside the main-
stream. I have worked very hard over a
number of years now—I guess we are in
our eighth year—working with Senator
TOOMEY, to fill district court vacancies
in Pennsylvania with well-qualified
and experienced judges whom I believe
will be able to set aside their ideologies
or personal beliefs and apply the law to
the cases before them. But I do not
have the same confidence in many of
the nominees before this body today
and especially the nominees we are
considering.
I will go in the order that I men-
tioned before—first, Michael Truncale,
then Kenneth Lee, and Wendy Vitter. I
believe that in all three cases, all are
not mainstream conservatives. Their
backgrounds and records are very po-
litical, and they have long records of
advocating for certain positions on
issues that may come before them as
either a U.S. district court judge or an
appellate judge.
First of all, Mr. Truncale has advo-
cated strongly for the repeal of the Af-
fordable Care Act, which provided
healthcare coverage and critical pa-
tient protections for 20 million people

in terms of coverage and tens of mil-
lions more in terms of protection.
He said that the Affordable Care Act
would ‘‘lead to the rationing of
healthcare.’’ He has personally advo-
cated for abolishing the Department of
Education, and he used false, un-
founded claims of voter fraud to sup-
port voter ID laws that disproportion-
ately affect low-income voters and
communities of color.
Second, Kenneth Lee was confirmed
over the objections of both California
Senators, Senator HARRIS and Senator
FEINSTEIN—Senator FEINSTEIN, in this
case, being the ranking member of the
Judiciary Committee, the very com-
mittee that considers judges. Mr. Lee
has a litany of writings that include of-
fensive statements about immigrants,
people of color, and LGBT Americans.
He has strongly opposed affirmative ac-
tion policies that help make our insti-
tutions of higher learning more di-
verse, and it is very possible that he
may consider matters relating to these
policies as a member of the Ninth Cir-
cuit.
Finally, Wendy Vitter has virtually
no Federal trial court experience, has a
long record of opposing contraception,
and has promoted false information
about the safety of oral contraceptives.
These views are not only outside of the
mainstream—the judicial or legal
mainstream—but they are also not sup-
ported by science.
I don’t believe these nominees will be
able to set aside their personal views
and apply relevant precedent, and my
concern is compounded by recent ef-
forts by conservative jurists to over-
turn longstanding precedents. Most
Americans thought that the Voting
Rights Act, which for decades pro-
tected the franchise for Americans of
color, particularly Black Americans,
was a foundational, almost untouch-
able statute. But in 2013, the conserv-
ative majority of the Supreme Court,
which has gotten only more conserv-
ative, moved to the right even more.
That Court, the Supreme Court, gutted
the protections of the Voting Rights
Act in the Shelby County v. Holder
case.
Just last year, in the Janus decision,
the Supreme Court overturned a four-
decades-old precedent in the Abood
case that allowed public sector unions
to collect nonpolitical, so-called fair
share fees to cover the costs of negotia-
tions that benefit all workers. So you
have the union doing the work, and the
law allowed them, for four decades, to
charge other employees who benefit
from the work of the union, and the
Supreme Court struck that down.
Pennsylvania passed a similar law in
the 1980s, which has been the law of the
land in Pennsylvania for years. It was
signed into law in the late 1980s by my
father when he was serving as Gov-
ernor, so that is an important issue in
Pennsylvania for working men and
women.
The conservative majority of the Su-
preme Court overturned the Abood
case, eviscerating a precedent that was
relied upon by public sector unions and
their governmental employers all over
the country. I believe the next step by
the far right and by this court and
maybe by the Supreme Court and
maybe in another court would be to
make illegal the very right to organize
for wages and benefits. I hope I am
wrong about that, but I believe that is
the logical next step for the right.
Just this week, a conservative major-
ity of the Supreme Court overturned a
40-year precedent regarding States’
sovereign immunity in the courts of
other States. In the last line of his dis-
sent, Justice Breyer sounded alarm
bells about this kind of judicial activ-
ism from the right, saying: ‘‘Today’s
decision can only cause one to wonder
which cases the court will overrule
next.’’
He is right. We no longer know what
is civil law and what could be up for de-
bate. We thought that Abood was set-
tled law in the context of labor unions
and the right to organize or an issue
related to the right to organize. We
thought the Voting Rights Act was set-
tled law.
This week we mark the 65th anniver-
sary of Brown v. Board of Education, a
unanimous Supreme Court decision
holding that segregation in our public
school system, in addition to being a
profound moral failure, was a violation
of our Constitution. I would hope—we
all would hope that Brown v. Board of
Education would remain rock solid set-
tled law. Yet, because of what we have
seen in the last couple of years with
this Court, we must stay vigilant. We
cannot let civil rights that Americans
fought for and earned and have cher-
ished for decades be chipped away by
extreme judicial nominees who hold in-
superable political and policy pref-
erences.
I oppose the nominees that the Sen-
ate has considered this week, and I will
continue to oppose extreme nominees
to our Federal courts.
I yield the floor to the distinguished
Democratic leader.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
thank my colleague Senator CASEY for,
as usual, his thoughtful, erudite, on-
the-money remarks—this time about
judges. I am going to talk about that
in a minute.
We see something happening here. We
see State after State trying to repeal
Roe. When we ask our Republican col-
leagues directly ‘‘Do you want to ap-
peal Roe?’’ they are usually silent.
Their votes on judges say they do, and
that is what they are doing. The voters
should hold them accountable. I will
get to that more in a minute, but I
wanted to follow up on the remarks
about judges by my good friend from
Pennsylvania.
IMMIGRATION
Madam President, yesterday, the
Trump administration released the
outlines of its plan for immigration re-
form. Truth be told, the reported White
House plan isn’t a serious attempt at
immigration reform. If anything, it is a
political document that is anti-immi-
gration reform. It repackages the same
partisan, radical, anti-immigrant poli-
cies that the administration has
pushed for 2 years, all of which have
struggled to earn even a simple major-
ity in the Senate, let alone 60 votes.
The hands of Stephen Miller are all
over this plan, and, of course, he had a
watchful eye when other administra-
tion officials came into the Republican
lunch yesterday and talked about it.
The plan they put together holds im-
migration precisely at current levels,
meaning that for every new immigrant
the plan potentially lets in, it must
kick one out. What kind of logic is
that? What kind of harebrained logic is
that—the idea that for every immi-
grant you help you have to hurt an-
other? How arbitrary. How simplistic.
How cruel. It is like the Procrustean
bed of immigration policy.
We need immigrants in America. Our
labor force is declining. If you go to
businesses at the high end, the middle
end, and the low end, they say their
greatest problem is a lack of workers.
And we come up with a policy like
this? Make no mistake about it. It is
cruel and inhumane, but it also hurts
our economy significantly. If you don’t
believe me, talk to business leaders—
any business leader you know.
Shockingly, the White House’s immi-
gration proposal fails to deal with
Dreamers or the 11 million undocu-
mented immigrants now living in the
United States. The White House Press
Secretary said Dreamers were ‘‘left out
on purpose.’’ What does that say about
the administration? That goes to the
root of what is wrong with this admin-
istration’s approach to immigration. If
they think they can repeat what they
failed to do in the past, if they try to
repeat it, saying ‘‘OK, we will let
Dreamers in, but you accept a whole
lot of bad things,’’ which is why immi-
gration reform failed last time, last
year, it ain’t happening. It ain’t hap-
pening.
I would say two things. If you are
going to do major immigration reform
through Congress, you are going to
need bipartisan support. That means
you sit down and talk to Democrats.
Four of us on the Democratic side and
four of us on the Republican side in the
Gang of 8 spent hours and weeks and
months together and carved together a
bill that got overwhelming support
from Democrats and Republicans in
this Chamber and was overwhelmingly
supported by the American people and
still is. I think 68 percent still support
comprehensive immigration reform.
But what does the White House do?
Typically, they put together their own
plan—Stephen Miller, chief cook and
bottle washer—and they say that
Democrats should support this. Ain’t
happening.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2898 May 16, 2019
No consultation, no nothing—that is
not the way you would go about put-
ting together a bill that you really
want to pass. That is not the way to go
about things if you really want to solve
our immigration problem.
When Stephen Miller, one of the
President’s most virulently anti-immi-
grant advisers, is in the room crafting
an immigration plan, it is a surefire
failure. The fact that the President is
announcing his bill today provides a
further bit of irony because, this after-
noon, the new Statue of Liberty mu-
seum opens. There is no greater symbol
of Americans’ openness to immigra-
tion, of the greatness of America, than
the Statue of Liberty, which reaches
out to people from every corner of the
globe. It towers over nearby Ellis Is-
land, where generations of hopeful
strivers shuffled off boats into a new
life and into a new country and helped
build America into the greatest coun-
try in the world.
The White House immigration bill is
an insult to our grand tradition of wel-
coming immigrants from all walks of
life, and it is an appropriate metaphor
that the President, today, is skipping
the opening of the new Statue of Lib-
erty museum, even though he is in New
York, simply to go to political fund-
raisers. He skips real immigration re-
form and offers a political document,
and his trip to New York embodies that
ironically and metaphorically.
IRAN
Madam President, on Iran, this has
been a chaotic week in the news about
the Trump administration’s position
on Iran. We have gone from reports
that the Trump administration’s na-
tional security team was discussing
possible troop deployments—one news-
paper, the New York Times, reported
120,000—to coverage now of infighting
among the President’s staff about the
credibility of the threat from Iran.
As usual, the signals indicate chaos
coming out of the White House—indi-
viduals fighting with each other, no
real plan, no real pattern, and no dis-
cussion with the American people or
with the Congress.
Yesterday, personnel were evacuated
from our Embassy in Iraq, and Repub-
licans in Congress have now started to
echo the same saber-rattling we typi-
cally hear from folks like Ambassador
Bolton. At this moment, the only thing
that is abundantly clear about the ad-
ministration’s Iran policy is its lack of
clarity and the lack of consultation
with Congress and with the American
people.
Congress has not been fully informed
about the intelligence. We have not
been properly consulted about the ad-
ministration’s strategy, to the extent
one exists.
More importantly, the American peo-
ple deserve to know what is going on
here. They are rightfully skeptical and
tired of wars in the Middle East—a
skepticism many of my Republican
friends across the aisle don’t seem to
share. We need to get a better public
understanding of what President
Trump and Republicans in Congress
plan to do.
Yesterday, I called on Acting Sec-
retary of Defense Shanahan and Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs Dunford to tes-
tify publicly before the Armed Services
Committee so that the American peo-
ple can at least get an idea of what is
being cooked up here. We have learned,
sadly, in Iraq, when things are done be-
hind closed doors and the American
people aren’t fully informed, it can
lead to significant foreign policy blun-
ders. So they should come up here—
General Dunford, Acting Secretary
Shanahan, as well as Secretary
Pompeo—and I hope that request will
be granted.
HEALTHCARE
Now, Madam President, on
healthcare and our friends creating the
Senate graveyard, as well as the abor-
tion bill in Alabama, the House has
passed over 100 pieces of legislation,
many of them with bipartisan support,
only to get buried in this graveyard of
a Chamber. Leader MCCONNELL, who
controls the calendar, prefers to run it
as a legislative graveyard.
Let’s take healthcare as an example,
the No. 1 issue the American people
care about. Our colleagues in the House
passed a modest bill to protect families
from getting charged more if they have
a preexisting condition. It should be bi-
partisan, and most Republicans—or
many of the Senate Republicans say
they agree with that policy when
asked. Well, we have a bill that does it,
and what does Leader MCCONNELL do?
He just deep-sixes it and sets aside an-
other tombstone for his legislative
graveyard.
What about today’s House vote on
another set of healthcare bills to pro-
tect people with preexisting conditions
and help them sign up for insurance?
What is the fate of those bills in the
Senate? Will Leader MCCONNELL sen-
tence them to the same legislative
death as all of these other proposals or
will Leader MCCONNELL actually allow
us to debate something of great impor-
tance to the American people, to
amend it, and then vote on it? Hope-
fully it will pass. I believe it would.
What is Leader MCCONNELL afraid of?
Is he afraid the American people will
get protection from preexisting condi-
tions? Is he afraid he might anger some
special interest? Is he afraid he might
anger President Trump? We have a
higher obligation here.
Instead of debating those crucial
pieces of legislation, Leader MCCON-
NELL has treated the Senate like a
rubberstamp for the Trump adminis-
tration’s often radical nominees. For 3
straight weeks, we have only processed
nominations, including several judges
who are merely unqualified ideologues
or merely unqualified.
This matters. The judges we have
heard from are narrow. Many have of-
fered bigoted remarks in the past, real-
ly bigoted. They are not who a judge
should be. A judge is supposed to walk
in the plaintiff’s shoes and the defend-
ant’s shoes, and then come up with a
decision that is governed by existing
law. These people are ideologues, many
of them stooges and acolytes for the
Federalist Society. Now we have in
Alabama the most radical anti-abor-
tion bill in the country, inviting a
challenge to Roe v. Wade in the courts.
So the effort by the Republican leader
to remake the Federal judiciary into a
conservative redoubt has a direct im-
pact on these legal challenges.
If you ask most of the Republican
Members in this Chamber ‘‘Are you for
repealing Roe v. Wade, hook, line, and
sinker?’’ they would say, no, they are
not or they would mostly be silent;
they would be afraid to answer. Then
they vote for judges who want to do it,
either frontally or by various deep
cuts. When our Republican friends vote
for these radical, hard-right judges,
they are saying they want to repeal
Roe v. Wade, even if they will not say
it directly.
So I say to my colleagues, much as
you prefer to remain silent on the Ala-
bama Republican abortion bill, your
votes for the hard-right, anti-Roe
judges speak volumes—volumes. I
would say the whole impetus of the
Alabama bill is now that we have very
conservative, anti-Roe judges on the
Supreme Court, supported universally
by the Members of the other side, they
feel they have the boldness to intro-
duce a bill that actually repeals Roe
instead of just curbing it.
CHINESE TRADE POLICY
Madam President, finally, something
good that I think the administration
has done. I was pleased for two reasons
to see the administration issue an Ex-
ecutive order laying the groundwork
for the Commerce Department to ban
all purchases of telecommunications
equipment from China’s State-con-
trolled firms.
First, it was a good decision for our
national security. We have long known
the threat posed by foreign tele-
communications companies, particu-
larly Chinese firms like Huawei and
ZTE. The tentacles of the Chinese Gov-
ernment are deep in these two compa-
nies. Our intelligence and defense com-
munities, concerned about our own se-
curity here in America, have banned
the use of Huawei products in the mili-
tary and labeled its technology a na-
tional security threat. That is serious
stuff.
So I applaud the decision to protect
our networks from potential malware,
foreign surveillance, and cyber espio-
nage, and I applaud the administration.
They backed off on ZTE 1 year ago, de-
spite the overwhelming support in this
Chamber for not letting ZTE sell prod-
ucts, but they are now doing the right
thing on Huawei, which is even a great-
er danger than ZTE.
There is a second reason this is a
good decision, aside from national se-
curity. It is called reciprocity. In
America, we make great products, and
time and again, when we make great

products, the Chinese don’t let us sell
them to China. They instead keep the
product out, steal the technology, and
then produce it themselves. Well, it is
about time there was a little fair
play—a little fair play. China, for
years, has sold products—likely with
stolen IP—here in the United States
cheaply while denying America access
to its markets.
Reciprocity matters. A lot of people
say to get China to negotiate, tariffs
aren’t the way to go. I have made my
views on that clear, but reciprocity is
another way to go. If China doesn’t let
our best stuff in, we are not letting
theirs in. Open up. Play fair. If we
don’t do something about China today,
our economy will be second-rate 10, 15
years from now, and our children and
grandchildren will suffer economically,
make no mistake about it.
Telecommunications, especially 5G
technology, are already a major focus
of American innovation. We shouldn’t
let Chinese companies worm in on the
cheap and put American businesses at
a disadvantage. The United States,
with our allies, should lead to the de-
velopment of a safe, secure, and eco-
nomically viable alternative to the 5G
architecture of firms like Huawei that
are subject to the infiltration by the
Chinese Government, which has shown
no qualms about stealing everything of
our intellectual property that they
can.
I would say to our European, Japa-
nese, and Australian allies, stick with
us on this; it will benefit everybody—
everybody. China is our No. 1 global
competitor, and it is about time they
played fair. What was done yesterday
with Huawei by Secretary Ross will
help make that happen, and it is a very
good decision.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I have
come to the floor to be joined soon by
my colleague and cochair of the Senate
Law Enforcement Caucus, Senator
COONS, to honor the men and women
who work for us every day to help pro-
tect us every day during Police Week.
This is an annual event. It brings law
enforcement officers to Washington
from around the country and of course
including my State of Missouri.
As it turns out, Police Week is really
a bad week to rob a store in Wash-
ington with a town full of policemen.
Just last week, several would-be rob-
bers came out of a robbery and almost
ran into a group of St. Louis area po-
licemen and a New Jersey policeman.
They immediately chased down and ar-
rested the perpetrators of that crime.
Criminals are often not very smart,
but you have to be particularly not
smart to decide you are going to rob a
store in Washington during Police
Week. Thank goodness for those who
wear blue and work to serve us and pro-
tect us every day and even do that
when they are off duty and hundreds of
miles away from home. So congratula-
tions to those officers for what they
did while they are here, and nobody is
very surprised by that.
When Senator COONS and I came to
the Senate a little over 8 years ago, we
started trying to find a law enforce-
ment caucus to join, and found out
there wasn’t one, so Senator COONS
said to me: Let’s just start one, and we
did. This is the week.
We get a chance every year to talk
about, specifically, what happens this
week. We look for opportunities
through the year to, No. 1, honor the
people who work here protecting us
every day, and, No. 2, to talk about
things happening in the country that
affect the people who protect us and
protect police and sheriff’s depart-
ments. This is the time of year, frank-
ly, when the tragic loss of family is so
evident as we add people to the police
memorial.
Four Missourians were added to that
list this year. Deputy Sheriff Aaron
Paul Roberts of the Greene County
Sheriff’s Office—the county I live in—
died when his patrol car was swept into
the Pomme de Terre River after he re-
sponded to a 911 call. Deputy Roberts
had served with the Sheriff’s Office for
about 1 year, but he had previously
served with the Willard Police Depart-
ment for 4 years. He is survived by his
wife, daughter, and by his parents.
In April of 2018, Miller County Dep-
uty Sheriff Casey Shoemate was killed
when his vehicle collided with an on-
coming vehicle while responding to a
structure fire. He had served with that
department for about 1 year as well,
but he previously worked in two other
Missouri police departments. He is sur-
vived by his two children, his fiancee,
his parents, and his siblings.
In March of 2018, Clinton Police De-
partment Officer Christopher Morton
was shot and killed when he and two
other officers responded to a 911 call.
As Officer Morton and his colleagues
arrived at the scene, a man began
shooting at them. The officers returned
fire. They entered the building. The
subject continued to fire. He fatally
wounded Officer Morton and injured
two of Officer Morton’s colleagues
whom I had a chance to visit with at
that department not long after this in-
cident.
Officer Morton had been with the
Clinton Police Department for 3 years.
Prior to that, he served in the U.S.
military through the Missouri Army
National Guard. He had been deployed
to Kosovo. He had been deployed to Af-
ghanistan. His parents and siblings, I
know, worried about him there but
wouldn’t have, in their wildest imagi-
nation, thought he would be killed at
home near his hometown when react-
ing to a 911 call from a house.
In March of last year, FBI Special
Agent Melissa Morrow, of Kansas City,
died from a brain cancer she developed
following the 9/11 terrorist attack on
the Pentagon. She had been assigned to
the Evidence Response Team of the
FBI Washington Field Office. She spent
10 weeks after that event recovering
and processing evidence from the site
in hazardous conditions. Melissa is sur-
vived by her parents, her sister, a
niece, and a nephew.
The names of these fallen men and
women were added to the National Law
Enforcement Officers Memorial here in
Washington and to the Wall of Honor
at the Missouri Law Enforcement Me-
morial over the last month. They will
be remembered by people who benefited
from and remember their bravery,
their dedication, and their sacrifice.
This is a time when we honor those
who serve us, particularly for lives
which have been lost, but it is also the
time to think about what we can do to
serve them in a better way, to be sure
they have the equipment they need,
the resources they need, and the train-
ing they need.
I mentioned at an event earlier today
that for the last 50 years, law enforce-
ment and emergency rooms have also
been, unfortunately for everybody in-
volved, the de facto mental health de-
livery system in the country. Officers
now take crisis intervention training
to be sure they are really prepared
when they are dealing with someone
whose intent is not criminal, but their
activities are impacted by their mental
health issues and what to do in that
situation so everybody is better served.
We have worked hard to see that the
Regional Information Sharing System
in our State, headquartered in Spring-
field, is properly funded. The High In-
tensity Drug Trafficking Areas Pro-
gram has the center for our region in
Kansas City. Those are things that
Senator COONS and I have worked to-
gether on to do our best to fund.
Two different times now, we have
worked together to extend the Victims
of Child Abuse Program. Last year, we
again introduced the bill. I think the
previous extension had been a 5-year
extension, and we came to the end of
that. This is the program where, at 23
centers in Missouri, people understand
how to get the forensic information,
the testimony they need from kids who
have either been the victims of crime
or witnesses of crimes.
Every law enforcement person I have
talked to, Senator COONS, every pros-
ecutor I have talked to believes that
what happens at these victims of child
abuse centers can’t be replaced any-
where else.
Now we are working together on the
National Law Enforcement Museum
Commemorative Coin Act, a bill that
the Senate passed last year, and the
House didn’t get to it. We want to do
that again. The Law Enforcement Mu-
seum in Washington would be the bene-
ficiary of the proceeds from that coin
after the cost of the coin is paid. We
are going to be working together on
that.
We have worked with other col-
leagues. I have worked with Senator
PAT ROBERTS of Kansas on the Kelsey

Smith Act. It is named after 18-year-
old Kelsey Smith, who was abducted
and murdered in 2007. This bill
strengthens the ability of law enforce-
ment to get the information they need,
quick access to someone’s cell phone to
get the information of where they
might still be or where they last were
when they separated from that phone,
if that is what happened.
Senator STABENOW and I are con-
tinuing to work on the Mental Health
and Addiction Treatment Act, some-
thing that every time we have support
testimony on that act, it always in-
volves law enforcement, which wants
more focus on mental health courts
and more focus on drug courts but par-
ticularly more focus on the ability of
officers to deal with the situation in
the best possible way when they come
upon it. Remembering those who have
fallen and continuing to work for those
who stand up for us and run to the side
of danger as they shield us from danger
is important.
I am glad to be joined today by my
good friend Senator COONS from Dela-
ware.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware.
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, it is an
honor and a joy for me to come to the
floor today not just as the Senator rep-
resenting Delaware but as the cochair
of the Senate Law Enforcement Cau-
cus, which I am very proud to have a
chance to lead with my friend and col-
league Senator BLUNT from Missouri.
As you just heard, he recited some of
the many ways in which we have been
able to work together. Senator BLUNT,
as a seasoned senior appropriator,
someone who has experience in the
House of Representatives and in the
private sector at home, leading an edu-
cational institution, and has worked in
State and local government, along with
my experience in local government and
the private sector—I think that has al-
lowed us to do really good and positive
things for the men and women of law
enforcement.
This is National Police Week. It is an
opportunity for us—not just here in the
Senate but all over the country—to
thank the hundreds of thousands of
men and women in State and local law
enforcement, as well as in Federal law
enforcement agencies, who make pos-
sible the opportunity we have to enjoy
our freedoms. Our basic safety, our
ability to travel far and wide, to speak
and live, and to praise and believe as
we hope—all of this is made possible
because of the ways in which our law
enforcement officers guarantee those
freedoms by literally putting their
lives on the line for us each and every
day. For that, we are eternally grate-
ful.
The Law Enforcement Caucus, which
Senator BLUNT and I founded, has held
a number of engaging and important
bipartisan sessions. You heard the Sen-
ator reference things like the High In-
tensity Drug Trafficking Areas Pro-
gram and RISS, the Regional Intel-
ligence Sharing System that helps to
connect resources between Federal and
State and local law enforcement. We
also recently had a session on sharing
relationship-building models where we
had folks in from Delaware and Mis-
souri to talk about how law enforce-
ment serves as positive role models and
mentors in the community through
terrific programs.
I look forward to continuing to work
with my friend and colleague Senator
BLUNT on these issues in the year
ahead in the Law Enforcement Caucus
and to talking briefly here on the floor
today about how we should not just
give great speeches but actually take
important actions to demonstrate to
the families and to the men and women
of law enforcement that we care deeply
about their service and about whether
they come home at the end of their
shift.
I serve on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. On a unanimous basis, we re-
cently advanced a series of bills that
will help advance officer safety, not
the least of which is making perma-
nent the Federal Bulletproof Vest
Partnership Program that has literally
saved lives across the country. The
capitol police—the police who protect
Delaware’s capitol and our court-
house—had a dramatic and personal ex-
perience with that when two law en-
forcement officers’ lives were saved
when they were shot in the line of
duty, and it was only because they
were wearing vests made possible by
this Federal-State partnership that
they survived.
I will also continue to work to sup-
port the COPS Program, which ensures
that we have officers on the ground in
communities large and small in Dela-
ware, such as Cheswold, Delmar, Lau-
rel, Ocean View, Smyrna, and my home
city of Wilmington. They all have been
able to hire new officers in recent years
because of the COPS Program.
We are also working together on re-
forms to the Public Safety Officers’
Benefits Program to ensure that fami-
lies of officers who are permanently
disabled or lose their lives in the line
of duty receive the benefits they richly
deserve.
Let me conclude by thanking and
honoring a few specific officers from
Delaware’s law enforcement commu-
nity for their service this past year. We
have not had any Delawareans’ names
added to the Wall of Honor referenced
by the Senator from Missouri, but all
of us who have affection for and sup-
port the law enforcement community
in Delaware know that we are simply
blessed this year to have not joined
that terrible roll of great honor of
those who have given their lives in the
line of duty.
Let me briefly thank Sergeant Paul
Doherty of the Delaware State Police,
who was awarded the Robert J.
Seinsoth Memorial Award as the 2018
Delaware Crime Stoppers Law Enforce-
ment Officer of the Year. His investiga-
tory work following up on a robbery
led to the apprehension of a serial, dan-
gerous criminal who harmed other
Delawareans.
Let me honor Detective Jonathan
Moyer, who led the investigation of
fraud and theft at Beebee Hospital in
Lewes, DE.
Let me honor Detective Ryan Schmid
from the Dover Police Department. He
is a 6-year veteran of that department
and maintained an amazing clearance
rate of 84 percent in investigated bur-
glaries, robberies, and attempted mur-
der and solved homicide.
Lastly, let me recognize Detective
Brad Cordrey, who is Delaware’s Child
Welfare Professional of the Year and
has served under Georgetown chief of
police R.L. Hughes, who said that
‘‘Brad’s dedication, compassion, and te-
nacity to solve serious cases are un-
matched.’’
There is so much more I could say,
but given the number of my colleagues
who have also come to the floor to
speak, let me conclude by simply say-
ing how grateful all of us are to the
men and women of law enforcement.
During this National Police Week, let
me say what a great blessing it is to be
able to continue to work with my col-
league Senator BLUNT of Missouri in
cochairing the Law Enforcement Cau-
cus in this Congress and hopefully for
many years to come.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
IRAN
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise
today to discuss the Senate’s failure to
meet its constitutional obligation and
conduct effective oversight of what
seems to me and many others to be
this administration’s inexorable march
toward war with Iran.
This week, the New York Times re-
ported that the Trump administration
is making plans to deploy 120,000 Amer-
ican troops to the Middle East in an-
ticipation of a confrontation with Iran.
It is no secret that some of the Presi-
dent’s closest advisers are focused on
regime change and possibly military
engagement with Iran.
I was encouraged by a story in the
Washington Post that was posted last
night. The headline of that story read
as follows: ‘‘Trump, frustrated by ad-
visers, is not convinced the time is
right to attack Iran.’’ That was the
headline in the version of the story re-
ported by four Washington Post report-
ers. In pertinent part, the story indi-
cated that the President thinks his ad-
visers ‘‘could rush the U.S. into a mili-
tary confrontation with Iran.’’ Then it
goes on to further state that ‘‘Trump
prefers a diplomatic approach to re-
solving tensions.’’ I am encouraged by
that, but we have to be vigilant when
it comes to this issue and the broader
issue of the use of force.
The plans that I mentioned before re-
ferred to by the New York Times ap-
parently were submitted by Acting De-
fense Secretary Shanahan. These are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2901
May 16, 2019
the most recent in a string of actions
this administration has taken, from
withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear
agreement, to designating the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard Corps—the so-
called IRGC—as a foreign terrorist or-
ganization, to suspending waivers that
allow partner countries to continue im-
porting Iranian oil.
I have a long record of working to
fight against Iranian aggression. We all
know—and we have said it often, and
we should say it again—Iran is and has
been the leading state sponsor of ter-
rorism. For years, many of us, in a bi-
partisan way, have led efforts to con-
front Iran, to sanction Iran, to hold
Iran accountable for its malign activ-
ity and actions in the Middle East and
its actions to support terrorist organi-
zations, whether it is Hezbollah or any
other terrorist organization. We will
continue that regardless of this debate.
But when the New York Times talked
about that military plan, they referred
to a prior engagement, a prior military
conflict—the conflict in Iraq. ‘‘Echoes
of Iraq War’’ was what the Times said.
These ‘‘echoes’’ trigger memories and
reflections of a misguided period of
this body’s history in which Congress
approved a U.S. invasion of Iraq based
upon faulty intelligence. By the end of
that long war, thousands of Americans
had been killed, and many more Ameri-
cans had been wounded.
In Pennsylvania alone, 197 Penn-
sylvanians were killed in action in the
Iraq war and more than 1,200 were
wounded. I haven’t even talked about
the conflict in Afghanistan, where
Pennsylvania lost more than 90. The
last number I saw was 91 Pennsylva-
nians were killed in action in Afghani-
stan. Pennsylvania is well familiar
with contributing fighting men and
women to conflicts from the beginning
of our Republic until this very day.
The administration’s actions on Iran
also ‘‘echo’’ our ongoing stalemate—
‘‘stalemate’’ might be an understate-
ment—regarding the authorization for
use of military force—the so-called
AUMF—against ISIS, for example.
If we don’t debate and vote on an
AUMF as it relates to Iran or any other
country or any other conflict, we are
not doing our job.
For 6 years, the United States has
been engaged in the fight against ISIS
in Iraq and Syria. For many years, the
executive branch has relied on the 2001
authorization for use of military force
to justify its fight against ISIS, as well
as to justify other military engage-
ments.
I ask Majority Leader MCCONNELL to
set aside time for sustained debate and
votes on a new authorization for use of
military force.
Last month, Secretary of State
Pompeo implied during testimony in
front of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee of the Senate that the 2001
AUMF to go after al-Qaida and its af-
filiates authorizes war with Iran. A lot
of people would disagree with that. I
believe that an 18-year-old authoriza-
tion needs an update—another under-
statement. The threats we confront
today have evolved since 2001.
As this administration seeks to link
al-Qaida and Iran in anticipation of a
military confrontation, I am concerned
over the bipartisan failure to hold both
this and the prior administration to ac-
count for their constitutional over-
reach over congressional authority.
I commend Senator KAINE and other
Senators from both parties for efforts
over the last number of years to force
a debate on congressional oversight
over this issue.
The majority leader should allow
floor time and a robust debate on con-
gressional war powers and oversight
over the Executive’s unilateral actions
that send American troops overseas.
The debate on the Yemen resolution
and the vote—several votes, actually,
on that—demonstrated that there is bi-
partisan concern over the use of force,
but we need a broader debate than we
had in the debate on the Yemen resolu-
tion.
As this administration pursues a
reckless strategy with Iran, it is time
for a sustained debate and vote on a
new authorization for use of military
force that allows our Nation to, in fact,
destroy terrorists and fight threats to
U.S. national security but doesn’t re-
sult in endless war. The 2001 and 2002
authorizations for use of military force
authorizing military action in Iraq and
Afghanistan are outdated and must be
replaced.
I will conclude with some words from
Abraham Lincoln in that now-famous
letter to Mrs. Bixby in which he talked
about the loss of her sons’ lives in the
Civil War. When they did the checks on
it, it turned out to be two sons. When
the President was writing, he thought
she had lost five sons. But we still have
families who suffer the loss of a son or
a daughter in conflict—we hope not as
many as two or more.
In this case, in the second paragraph,
President Lincoln said ‘‘the grief of a
loss so overwhelming.’’ He then went
on to say to this grieving mother:
But I cannot refrain from tendering you
the consolation that may be found in the
thanks of the Republic they died to save.
I pray that our Heavenly Father may as-
suage the anguish of your bereavement, and
leave you only the cherished memory of the
loved and lost, and the solemn pride that
must be yours to have laid so costly a sac-
rifice upon the altar of freedom.
So said President Lincoln at that
time.
The words still ring true today—‘‘the
grief of a loss so overwhelming,’’ the
memory of ‘‘the loved and lost.’’ It
goes on to read ‘‘so costly a sacrifice.’’
Every President should read this let-
ter as he or she deliberates about the
use of force that commits our sons and
daughters to fight and risk their lives.
When we talk about so costly a sac-
rifice, we all know what happened in
our State. Military families in Penn-
sylvania, in the conflicts in Iraq and
Afghanistan, endured so costly a sac-
rifice.
I hope President Trump will reread
this letter as he deliberates our next
steps with regard to Iran and our next
steps with regard to the authorization
for the use of military force.
I yield the floor.

REAUTHORIZING THE BULLET-
PROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP
GRANT PROGRAM
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as in leg-
islative session, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of H.R. 2379.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the bill by title.
The legislative clerk read as follows:
A bill (H.R. 2379) to reauthorize the Bullet-
proof Vest Partnership Grant Program.
There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded to consider the bill.
Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a
third time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The bill was ordered to a third read-
ing and was read the third time.
Mr. LEAHY. I know of no further de-
bate on the bill.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
further debate?
Hearing none, the bill having been
read the third time, the question is,
Shall the bill pass?
The bill (H.R. 2379) was passed.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the motion to
reconsider be considered made and laid
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
H.R. 2379
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this may
seem like just a perfunctory thing, but
I want to speak about what we just did.
The Senate passed legislation to per-
manently reauthorize the Bulletproof
Vest Partnership Grant Program. This
is the sixth time I have worked to re-
authorize this lifesaving program since
I and my Republican partner, Senator
Ben Nighthorse Campbell, of Colorado,
authored the legislation to establish it
more than 20 years ago.
My role in authoring this program—
and my commitment to it ever since as
we have reauthorized it and reauthor-
ized it—was, in part, motivated by a
horrific incident the year before Sen-
ator Nighthorse Campbell and I created
it.
On August 19, 1997, a man named Carl
Drega went on a killing spree along the
Vermont and New Hampshire border.
After hours of pursuit, Federal, State,
and local law enforcement authorities
in Vermont and New Hampshire cor-
nered Drega, and in an ensuing ex-
change of gunfire, he was killed.
During the shoot-out, all of the Fed-
eral law enforcement officers involved
were wearing bulletproof vests. This in-
cludes John Pfeifer, a Vermonter and a

longtime friend. His father was one of
my favorite professors in college, and I
remember John as a child. He was seri-
ously wounded. In fact, at that time,
then-FBI Director Louis Freeh and his
family were staying with us at our
home in Vermont.
We visited Officer Pfeifer, who was a
U.S. Border Patrol agent, in the hos-
pital. He was grievously wounded, but
he survived and later became the Chief
Patrol Agent of the sector. I have al-
ways feared—and I believe he agrees—
that had it not been for his bulletproof
vest, the outcome for John and his
family may have been much worse.
Some of the state and local officers
involved were not that fortunate. Two
New Hampshire state troopers were
killed. They were not wearing bullet-
proof vests. I don’t know whether vests
would have saved their lives. Let us
hope they would have.
One thing I do know is that no officer
should have to serve without having
the benefit of wearing a bulletproof
vest. That is what this is all about. I
am immensely proud of this program.
It is the most tangible support that all
of us in Congress—both parties—can
provide to our Nation’s law enforce-
ment officers.
To this day, for far too many juris-
dictions, especially rural and smaller
agencies, vests cost too much, and they
wear out too soon. This program fills
in the gap. It has provided more than
13,000 law enforcement agencies with
1.35 million vests. It has saved the lives
of countless officers, several of whom
have shared their stories with the Judi-
ciary Committee, here in the Senate,
during previous years. In fact, accord-
ing to the Government Accountability
Office, more than 3,000 officers’ lives
have been saved by vests since 1987. It
makes me very proud to know these of-
ficers can still be with their families
and their departments.
Just yesterday, my office received a
call from the Union City Police Depart-
ment in Georgia. Last month, one of
its officers, Jerome Turner, Jr.—shown
in this photograph—was shot multiple
times when he responded to a call. One
round hit him directly in the chest, but
it did not get through his bulletproof
vest. When backup arrived, Officer Tur-
ner was lying on the ground from his
other injuries. He went through 6 hours
of surgery, but he lived. His depart-
ment called yesterday to tell me that
the vest that saved his life was pur-
chased through this program. Every-
body in my office and I just applauded
at that news.
My staff also had a chance to talk
with Officer Turner. He is still recov-
ering, but he said he is happy to be
home with his family—his family he
might never have seen again. He also
said what we all know to be true—the
Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant
Program is critical to ensuring officers
around the country can return home to
their families after their shifts.
Officer Turner knows a lot about this
program. It turns out that he pre-
viously served as the chief of police in
a small town in Florida, which is the
Presiding Officer’s State. He used this
program to outfit his officers with pro-
tective vests in order to keep his offi-
cers safe while they were protecting us.
This week is National Police Week. It
is a time for the Nation to honor the
many brave men and women in law en-
forcement who have lost their lives
while having served their communities.
That includes the 163 officers who were
lost last year—52 of them killed by
gunfire. The fact that Congress has
now passed legislation to permanently
reauthorize this program places real
meaning behind our words of tribute.
The legislation also increases the fund-
ing for vests as, year after year, only a
fraction of the need is met.
This program is not now, and never
has been, partisan. When we started, I
said that I and Ben Nighthorse Camp-
bell, of Colorado—a Republican—start-
ed it. I am especially grateful to Sen-
ator LINDSEY GRAHAM for being the
lead cosponsor of both this and the last
reauthorization.
Last week, our bill was being consid-
ered by the Judiciary Committee. I
have to admit I was a bit surprised and
very humbled when Chairman GRAHAM
called up an amendment to name the
program after me and when it then got
a unanimous vote from Republicans
and Democrats. I am always going to
be thankful, for the program is per-
sonal to me, and it is personal, cer-
tainly, to the officers who wear these
vests.
I thank my many staff who have
worked on this program for 22 years,
including Dave Pendle, Erica Chabot,
Ed Pagano, Bruce Cohen, Matt
Virkstis, Kristine Lucius, Chan Park,
David Carle, Jessica Berry, and many
others.
I am also thankful to the entire law
enforcement community, which has
spoken with a single voice on this
issue—a single voice. In particular I
would like to thank Chuck Canterbury,
Jim Pasco, and Tim Richardson with
the Fraternal Order of Police—all
friends of mine. The FOP has strongly
supported this program from the begin-
ning, and has been there for each of the
six reauthorizations.
I would also like to thank for their
support the International Association
of Chiefs of Police, the National Asso-
ciation of Police Organizations, the Na-
tional Sheriffs’ Association, the Major
County Sheriffs’ Association, the
Major Cities Chiefs Association, the
Federal Law Enforcement Officers As-
sociation, the National Tactical Offi-
cers Association, and the Sergeants Be-
nevolent Association, Last, I would
like to thank the sponsors of the House
companion which the Senate just
passed, Congressmen BILL PASCRELL
and PETER KING.
Without this legislation, the Bullet-
proof Vest Partnership Grant Program
would expire next year. Once this legis-
lation is signed into law, it will never
expire. It has already saved the lives of
so many, and placed vests on the backs
of well over one million officers. Now
we know that millions more officers
will be protected, and millions of offi-
cers like Officer Turner will be able to
go home to their families.
I wonder if the Senate would allow
me to tell a story.
When we were doing the reauthoriza-
tion, I had asked a police officer from
Pennsylvania to come and testify. He
came. His parents, his wife, and his
children sat behind him. He gave very
moving testimony. He said the two
most important things to him in life
were his family and law enforcement.
He told us about how, a short while be-
fore, he stopped a car at a routine traf-
fic stop. He got out of his police car,
and the person in the other car stepped
out and fired four shots at him—point
blank. He fell over. Others caught the
person.
He said: As I was falling, I thought I
would never see my family again. I had
a couple of cracked ribs. They came to
visit me in the hospital. I went back
home with them to their love and care.
Then I went back to work. This is what
saved me.
He reached under the table and held
up a bulletproof vest, and you could
still see three large caliber slugs em-
bedded in it.
He said: Those would have been in
my heart. I never would have seen my
family, and I never would have gone
back to law enforcement.
At that time, I was the chair of the
Senate Judiciary Committee. After his

unanimous vote to reauthorize. It was
the fastest unanimous vote I can re-
member in that committee.
As I said then and as I say now, this
is the least Congress can do on behalf
of our Nation’s law enforcement offi-
cers. Obviously, I am proud to have had
the legislation named after me, but I
am proud of all of the Senators over
the last 20-plus years—Republicans and
Democrats—who have supported it. I
am glad we have done it. Now it will
head to the President for his signature,
and I am sure the President will sign it
without delay.

tion.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today
I am on the floor to talk about the men
and women in uniform, our police offi-
cers who protect us every day. They
are here in the Capitol protecting us in
the Chamber. They are in Ohio pro-
tecting the citizens of Ohio, and they
do it every day. They put their lives on
the line for us in many cases.
This is National Police Week, a week
when tens of thousands of police offi-
cers come to Washington, DC. They
come to the police memorial. It has
been a wonderful week because I had
the opportunity to meet with law en-
forcement officers from Ohio, today,
yesterday, and the day before. We have
seen them on the streets. We have seen
them in uniform. Their opportunity to
come here is to talk about the impor-
tant issues that relate to our law en-
forcement but also to pay tribute to
their fallen colleagues.
Sadly, Ohio has lost its share of offi-
cers recently. Officers who have lost
their lives in the line of duty include
two so far this year and four last year.
On February 2, Clermont County De-
tective Bill Brewer was shot and killed
after responding to a call from a suici-
dal man who was armed at an apart-
ment complex just east of Cincinnati,
in Clermont County. Detective Brewer
served at the sheriff’s department for
20 years, and was widely respected.
The funeral was amazing. There was
an overwhelming number of people.
Grateful citizens showed up and law en-
forcement from our entire region and,
in fact, law enforcement from even
other States. At his service I had the
honor of presenting his widow and
young son with a flag that had flown
over the U.S. Capitol, in honor of him
and in gratitude to his family.
On that day, County Sheriff Steve
Leahy said of Detective Brewer:
He was an outstanding man. He was a good
father, a good husband, a good friend, a good
employee. He’s what this country needs more
of.
I agree with Sheriff Leahy.
On January 4, Colerain Township Po-
lice Officer Dale Woods was hit by a ve-
hicle while working at the scene of an
automobile accident, and he passed
away 3 days later as a result of his in-
juries. Police Chief Mark Denney re-
membered Woods as a hero who once
saved a baby inside a hot car and also
ran into a burning building to save a
blind woman. That is the type of self-
less and courageous officer he was. He
represented the best.
Last July, Cleveland Patrol Officer
Vu Nguyen, a 25-year veteran of the de-
partment, collapsed while taking part
in police training exercises. Vu was
known as a people person, someone
who cared a lot for his fellow citizens
and always went the extra mile to help
anyone who asked. His family said that
was the reason he became a police offi-
cer, because he wanted a job where he
could help people. That is what police
officers do.
In June of last year, Mentor Police
Officer Matthew Mazany was struck
and killed by a hit-and-run driver while
assisting another officer during a traf-
fic stop. Officer Mazany had served
with the Mentor Police Department for
14 years. He was beloved by his fellow
officers, by his family and friends, and
by his entire community.
This morning I had the opportunity
to visit the National Law Enforcement
Officers Memorial, here in Washington,
DC. I was able to see the inscribed
names on the wall there of thousands
of law enforcement officers we have
lost over the years. If you haven’t been
down there, it is a powerful experience.
There were also beautiful memorials
set up around those walls with wreaths,
flowers, photographs, magazine arti-
cles, newspaper articles, and other in-
formation about officers whom we lost
in the last year, including these two of-
ficers from Westerville, OH, who were

tragically murdered last year while
serving their community and all of us.
On February 10, 2018, Westerville Po-
lice Officers Anthony Morelli and Eric
Joering were fatally shot while re-
sponding to a 911 call. Sadly, it was
fatal. They had rushed to the scene.
They had arrived to help. They were
under fire. Officer Joering was killed at
the scene. Officer Morelli died in sur-
gery later that day.
I have had the great honor of meet-
ing the families of both of these fallen
officers—amazing women and amazing
kids. Linda Morelli and Jami Joering
are incredibly strong women and in-
credibly strong mothers. I was able to
express condolences and gratitude from
all Ohioans for their husbands’ service.
The memorials I saw today were a
moving tribute to those two police offi-
cers, two fallen officers who served
their fellow Ohioans with honor. Soon
their names will be inscribed on the po-
lice wall I talked about at the memo-
rial. Their names will be inscribed
there for the ages for all of us to see
and so that we can all remember the
ultimate sacrifice they and other offi-
cers have made for us.
We continue to hold up their families
and the families of the fallen. We con-
tinue to hold them up in our prayers
and to show our support and express
our enduring gratitude.
Thank you, Mr. President.

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this
Sunday, I have the honor of joining
some of the most courageous, faithful,
and inspiring Texans whom I ever met
for the grand opening and dedication of
their new church.
These men and women are part of the
congregation at the First Baptist
Church of Sutherland Springs. For the
vast majority of its 100-year history,
this small church was adored by mem-
bers of the community as a place of
worship, but it didn’t get much atten-
tion on the national stage. On Novem-
ber 5, 2017, all of that changed when a
deranged shooter opened fire on their
Sunday service, killing 26 parish-
ioners—adults, teenagers, children, and
an unborn baby. The church became
the site of the deadliest mass shooting
in Texas history.
This violent attack rocked the entire
small, tight-knit town to its core.
Every home, every family, and every
person felt the impact of the shooter’s
actions, but what emerged wasn’t more
of the hatred and anger displayed by
the shooter. Instead, Sutherland
Springs became a beacon of love and
hope. The day of the attack I spoke
with Wilson County Sheriff Joe
Tackitt and offered my condolences
and complete support. Sheriff Tackitt
told me about the day’s events and said
the bloody scene inside the First Bap-
tist Church was horrific, but the re-
sponse to the tragedy was instanta-
neous. First responders from the sur-
rounding area, as well as State and
Federal law enforcement officials, in-
undated Sutherland Springs with re-
sources and help.
In the days and weeks following the
attack, the support continued. Folks
from across the country made their
way to this small town outside of San
Antonio to pay their respects, leaving
flowers outside the church, singing
songs of worship, and extending a car-
ing hand to those grieving.
I joined the congregation 1 week
after the shooting for their Sunday
service, and it was an emotional expe-
rience, to be sure. I was there to offer
what I could in terms of support and
hope to this grieving community, but
what happened was just the opposite.
They were the ones giving me inspira-
tion.
That day, as the associate pastor
pointed out, the church smashed at-
tendance records. It was remarkable to
see not only the church community but
also complete strangers embracing one
another, offering a shoulder to cry on
or a hand to hold.
There was perhaps no more moving
occurrence than Pastor Frank Pom-
eroy. He and his wife lost their teenage
daughter in the shooting.
One week after that occurred, he
opened that service saying: ‘‘We have
the freedom to choose, and rather than
choose darkness like the young man
did that day, we choose the light.’’
Coming from a man who lost 26 be-
loved members of his congregation, in-
cluding his own daughter, those words
are tough to get your brain around.
When he was going through what I
have no doubt was the toughest mo-
ment of his life, Pastor Pomeroy was
comforting those of us in the audience
and reminding us not to let evil tri-
umph.
As more details about the shooter
emerged, that message of hope was
even more important to recall. We
learned that the shooter had a long his-
tory of violence, and a number of red
flags had been raised—school suspen-
sions, comments about wanting to kill
his superiors, animal abuse, and vio-
lence toward those closest to him. He
had choked his wife, fractured his step-
son’s skull, and done time in military
prison.
Under existing Federal laws, the
shooter was prohibited from ever pur-
chasing or possessing a firearm. It was
illegal. So how did he get his hands on
this weapon that he used to take 26 in-
nocent lives?
Well, in short, it was because of a
broken system. He was able to pur-
chase four firearms because informa-
tion about his criminal history was
never uploaded into the National In-
stant Criminal Background Check Sys-
tem, also known as NICS.
In the wake of the tragedy, you al-
ways wonder, how did this happen and,
more importantly, what can we pos-
sibly do to prevent something like this
from happening again? Well, in this
case, one answer was pretty clear. We
have to fix the National Criminal In-
stant Background Check System so
gun purchasers can’t lie and buy fire-
arms that they are already legally dis-
qualified from purchasing or pos-
sessing.
Eleven days after the shooting, it be-
came clear to me how this system had
broken down. The Air Force had simply
failed to upload this information into
the background checks system so it
wasn’t there when this shooter bought
those guns. In response, I introduced
the Fix NICS Act to reform the system
and ensure that all Federal agencies
accurately and correctly upload these
required conviction records. This legis-
lation also encourages States and local
jurisdictions, to the extent possible
under the Constitution, to do exactly
the same. We can’t make them do it,
but we can encourage them to do it and
facilitate their doing so.
It has been estimated that some 7
million records, including at least 25
percent of felony convictions and a
large number of convictions for mis-
demeanor domestic violence, are ab-
sent from NICS—7 million records, in-
cluding 25 percent of felony convic-
tions, and a large number of convic-
tions for domestic violence were absent
from the National Instant Criminal
Background Check System.
How in the world can we expect that
system to work to protect us and our
communities if, in fact, the required
information is not being uploaded?
Each missing record represents a
unique opportunity for someone like
the shooter at Sutherland Springs to
slip through the cracks. So we knew
what we had to do to change that.
I worked with my colleagues in the
Senate, on a bipartisan basis, and en-
couraged them to support the Fix NICS
Act. I was heartened and encouraged
by the bipartisan support we got. This
legislation passed with 77 Members of
the Senate serving as cosponsors. When
the President signed this bill into law,
it marked a major achievement and
step forward and delivered on the
promise I made to myself following
Pastor Pomeroy’s advice: focus on the
light and not on the darkness.
I am grateful for the support of my
colleagues who cosponsored and voted
for this legislation, which has made
our background check system stronger.
It actually made it so it will work the
way Congress originally intended when
it created the National Instant Crimi-
nal Background Check System main-
tained by the FBI.
I have and will continue to work with
the officials at the Department of Jus-
tice to ensure that this law is fully im-
plemented as soon as possible.

May 16, 2019
I look forward to joining my friends
at the First Baptist Church of Suther-
land Springs this week to honor those
they lost and to celebrate the grand
opening of their new worship center
and education building.
Today I once again extend my deep-
est condolences to the families of those
lost and to the community that con-
tinues to grieve. They have my full
support, and I vow to do everything in
my power to prevent this type of sense-
less violence from becoming the norm.
No family, no congregation, no commu-
nity should ever lose a loved one be-
cause of an entirely preventable crime.
I hope because of this legislation, they
never will.
I will just say, in conclusion on this
topic, what consolation, what comfort
can you give to someone grieving the
loss of a loved one? I can only think of
one thing; that as a result of their loss
and their sacrifice, some good will
come out of it. I think the only way to
reconcile your grief and your loss is
knowing that out of your loss, some-
thing good will come out of it. I can
genuinely say that as a result of the
loss of these 26 parishioners at the
First Baptist Church of Sutherland
Springs, we will save lives in the fu-
ture. There will be lives saved and lives
lived as a result of their sacrifice and
what we have done working together to
try to prevent those types of acts of
senseless, preventable violence from
occurring in the future.
IMMIGRATION
Mr. President, throughout our coun-
try’s history, we welcomed men and
women and children from other coun-
tries who are inspired by the freedoms
and the prosperity made possible by
our Constitution and by our democ-
racy. Whether those immigrants
crossed oceans generations ago or were
more recently naturalized, we are glad
they chose to bring their dreams and
talents to the United States because
ours, after all, is a proud nation of im-
migrants. I believe the contributions of
those who have chosen to seek citizen-
ship in our country have made us
stronger, smarter, and the preeminent
force on the world stage.
It is important to remember, as we
debate immigration reform or what to
do about the humanitarian crisis and
security crisis on the border—it is im-
portant to remember that the United
States is the most generous country in
the world when it comes to legal immi-
gration. Every year, our Nation admits
more than 1 million new legal immi-
grants, and I am proud of that fact. I
am also proud of the fact that these in-
dividuals—these 1 million individuals
who immigrated to our country—do so
in compliance with the laws of the land
that they now call home. Perhaps one
of the ultimate demonstrations of re-
spect is recognizing the responsibilities
all of us have to abide by the laws of
the land.
We know our immigration system is
not perfect. It has flaws. I would argue
it is outdated and inefficient, and it
hasn’t kept up with the needs of our
economy. Our immigration system
needs a fundamental review to deter-
mine what is working and what isn’t so
we can create a new legal immigration
system that benefits both immigrants
and our success as a nation.
I know there is widespread agree-
ment in the Senate that our legal im-
migration system could be made bet-
ter, and I hope there is enough will in
Congress to have serious discussions
about how to fix it.
This afternoon, the President is ex-
pected to announce his proposal to re-
form our legal immigration system,
and I am glad he and his administra-
tion have made this a priority. I look
forward to reviewing the final text of
the proposal once it is available.
For those who would criticize the
proposal made by the Trump adminis-
tration, I believe it is incumbent on
them to say what they would do to fix
our broken immigration system, to im-
prove our system of legal immigration,
so we can continue to welcome immi-
grants from around the world who want
to make America their home and truly
become Americans.
Those who just sit on the sidelines
and throw brickbats and criticize, I
think they demean this system of legal
immigration, which is really one of the
great treasures of the American way of
life.
I continue to be hopeful that we can
work our way through this. I am glad
the President is making this a priority,
and I look forward to hearing more
about the details of his plan.
I yield the floor.

ator from Iowa.
TAX PROVISIONS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, some
time ago, specifically February 28, I
came to the Senate to visit with my
colleagues about the more than two
dozen tax provisions that expired at
the end of 2017. That same day, I joined
with Finance Committee Ranking
Member WYDEN of Oregon to introduce
a bill entitled ‘‘Tax Extender Disaster
Relief Act of 2019’’ to extend these two
dozen tax provisions through 2019.
I very much thank Ranking Member
WYDEN for his cooperation on this ef-
fort. Actually, we have a lot of co-
operation on a lot of different subjects
within the Finance Committee.
Now, unfortunately, we are still
waiting on House Democrats to send us
a tax bill that includes those provi-
sions so taxpayers who have relied on
them can finish their 2018 tax returns.
I have had some discussions with the
chairman of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, and I don’t have any reason to
believe he doesn’t believe some of these
extenders should be extended. I suppose
because they are new to run the House
of Representatives, and they have dis-
sension within their own caucus, it
takes a while to get an active group of
people pushing for this particular legis-
lation, but it ought to be easy to hap-
pen because these tax provisions have
traditionally been extended every 2 or 3
years over the last 20 years—maybe
longer than that in some cases.
I remind my colleagues in the House
of Representatives that taxpayers have
all but run out of time. Part of my pur-
pose in introducing the Tax Extender
and Disaster Relief Act way back in
February was to provide additional cer-
tainty for the current year for those
businesses that have made use of these
tax credits in the past.
I noted that in most cases, Congress
enacted those provisions to provide an
incentive for taxpayers to engage in
certain actions like investment and job
creation.
In February, I also reminded my col-
leagues that those incentives are most
effective when taxpayers can rely on
them during the tax year. For the most
part, over the last three decades, they
have had that certainty by the renewal
of these tax provisions.
Regrettably, we are now one-third of
the way through 2019 with no certainty
for affected taxpayers in sight. I also
said, in my February remarks, that my
broader objective of including an ex-
tension through 2019 was so we could
have some maneuvering room to exam-
ine the temporary provisions overall
and try to identify longer term solu-
tions. Through efforts in the last Con-
gress, we identified potential long-term
solutions for two of them—the short-
line railroad tax credit and the bio-
diesel tax credit—but we have the op-
portunity now to do more.
While we continue to try to help tax-
payers who still need to resolve their
2018 tax returns, we need to press ahead
on more permanent solutions so we can
end Congress’s continual bad habit of
waiting until the eleventh hour or
months after to extend temporary tax
policy.
Accordingly, today, I am announcing,
along with Ranking Member WYDEN,
that the Finance Committee will form
several bipartisan task forces to exam-
ine the temporary tax policies. These
task forces will consist of members of
the Finance Committee and will focus
on provisions that expired or will ex-
pire between December 31, 2017, and De-
cember 31 of this year. That is a total
of 42 expiring tax provisions.
Each task force will be charged with
examining temporary tax policies
within one of five identified issue
areas. These issue areas are: workforce
and community development, health
taxes, energy, business cost recovery,
and a combined group consisting of in-
dividual, excise taxes, and other tem-
porary policies.
We will ask the task forces to work
with the stakeholders, other Senate of-
fices, and interested parties to consider
the original purposes of the policies
and whether the need for the provisions
continues today. If so, we will ask the
task force to identify possible solutions
that would provide long-term certainty
in these areas. That may mean the
credit or deduction phases out over a
period of years to provide an affected

industry a glide path to self-suffi-
ciency. In other cases, it may mean the
provision could be scaled back while
still providing a sufficient benefit for
the affected industry or taxpayers in
exchange for long-term certainty. If
there is little or no case for continuing
the temporary policy, the task force
should consider whether the provision
should be eliminated.
There may also be provisions that
the task force identifies that should be
extended without reform. For these
provisions, the task force will have to
consider whether a continued short-
term extension is sufficient to achieve
the policy goals, whether a longer term
extension is desirable to force a future
Congress to reevaluate the provision
down the road, or if permanency is
warranted.
This is particularly relevant for the
temporary tax policies relating to
healthcare. For these, we will ask the
task force to focus on whether the tax
policy should be extended and for what
duration. Of course, we will leave the
evaluation of the underlying
healthcare policy to the health experts.
In all, the task forces will work to
identify reform proposals, like those
identified for the short-line railroad
tax credit and the biodiesel tax credit
last year, so we can end the policy of
having Congress always kick the can
down the road each time, or, as is the
case with 2018, an even worse policy of
doing the kicking months after the
year has ended.
If Congress is going to use temporary
tax policy, taxpayers should be able to
count on it for the intended period.
Moreover, the intended policy should
be clear so that taxpayers do not fall
into the trap of relying on a provision
simply because Congress has created
the expectation that the provisions
will be consistently extended even well
after the fact.
Taxpayers who have been relying on
these provisions have been doing what
Congress has wanted them to do. That
happens to be free-market investing in
certain types of property, hiring new
employees, or taking other types of ac-
tion. We shouldn’t punish them for
doing what Congress intended with
these tax provisions.
Additionally, we will have a sixth
task force to examine the related issue
of temporary disaster tax relief. It will
consider whether we should have a core
set of permanent proposals so tax-
payers who have suffered through dev-
astating disasters—like with the
floods, most recently, in my home
State of Iowa—don’t have to wait for
Congress to act before they can start
rebuilding their lives, their small busi-
nesses, or their farms.
We have asked the task forces to
begin their work right away, and we
expect them to complete their efforts
by the end of June. This should provide
adequate time to identify possible
long-term solutions that could be en-
acted this year to end the annual ex-
tenders drama and provide certainty to
the taxpayers who utilize those provi-
sions.
We will continue to work with the
House of Representatives to resolve the
situation with respect to the 2018 tem-
porary policies and to provide relief for
all of those affected by the disasters of
2018 and so far this year, but we
shouldn’t wait any longer to start lay-
ing the groundwork to deal with all of
these temporary tax policies as perma-
nently as possible.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I
thank the chairman of the Finance
Committee, Senator GRASSLEY, for his
leadership on these issues. I look for-
ward to working with him on the as-
signed task forces and to working hard
on very important issues that he and I
have been working on in the past—
from biodiesel, to energy policy, to a
variety of things. I thank him for that.
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK
Mr. President, I come to the floor to
honor the integrity, dignity, and brav-
ery of the Federal, State, local, and
Tribal police officers throughout our
country who keep us safe every day.
As officers from around the Nation
gather here in Washington, DC, to
honor their fallen brothers and sisters
and to add their names to the National
Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, I
take a moment to thank the officers
for their service and to pay tribute to
those who have died in the line of duty.
In 2018, 159 officers nationwide were
killed in the line of duty, and already
this year, 41 officers throughout the
United States have made the ultimate
sacrifice to protect our communities
and protect our loved ones. Two of
these officers came from my home
State of Washington.
Cowlitz County deputy sheriff Justin
DeRosier served the people of Wash-
ington for 6 years—3 in Cowlitz County
and 3 in Whitman County. He was a
graduate of Kelso High School and of
Washington State University. He loved
going to work every day to serve and
protect the people of Cowlitz County.
My thoughts and the thoughts and
prayers of all Washingtonians are with
his wife, Katie, his new daughter, his
entire family, and the entire Cowlitz
County law enforcement community.
Kittitas County sheriff’s deputy
Ryan Thompson served the people of
Washington for 12 years. He was born
in Walla Walla and graduated from
Central Washington University. Wheth-
er it be with Kittitas County or in the
police ranks of Central Washington
University, he served his community
with honor.
Our thoughts and prayers are with
his wife, his three children, his entire
family, and the Kittitas County Sher-
iff’s Department as they work through
this unbelievable tragedy.
Since 2017, four other officers from
Washington State have also lost their
lives in the line of duty: Diego Moreno
from Kent, deputy sheriff Daniel
McCartney from Pierce County, detec-
tive Derrick Focht from Kent, and
chief of police Randall Scott Gibson
from Kalama.
All of these men deserve a great deal
of respect and gratitude for their serv-
ice and for their sacrifice. All of the
men and women in law enforcement de-
serve our respect and gratitude for
their commitment and dedication to
our country and for embodying the
best of our Nation.
I have seen so many of the men and
women of law enforcement who have
come here to DC this week to partici-
pate in this memorial. It is right that
we give them recognition, and it is
right that we remember the sacrifice
law enforcement officers make every
single day on our behalf.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I know
of no further debate on the nomina-
tion.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
question is, Will the Senate advise and
consent to the Rosen nomination?
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask
for the yeas and nays.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a
sufficient second?
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.
The clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk called the roll.
Mr. THUNE. The following Senator is
necessarily absent: the Senator from
Tennessee (Mr. ALEXANDER).
Further, if present and voting, the
Senator from Tennessee (Mr. ALEX-
ANDER) would have voted ‘‘yea.’’
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the
Senator from New York (Mrs. GILLI-
BRAND) and the Senator from California

IRAN
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, years
before President Trump moved to the
White House, even before President
Obama and his family lived there, our
Nation was at odds with an isolated
country ruled by a repressive leader. It
wasn’t long before it became clear to
the United Nations and to our coun-
try’s own intelligence community that
the country I am speaking of was en-
riching uranium for the purpose of ob-
taining a nuclear weapon, threatening
to destabilize a region of great stra-
tegic importance.
As the world was winding down from
a cold war, tensions between the
United States and this country were
heating up. An administration that
some would call naive recently at-
tempted to deescalate tensions, taking
an unprecedented step to hold out an
olive branch to an unpredictable re-
gime in hopes of reaching a momentous
agreement to stop them from con-
tinuing to enrich uranium. Surpris-
ingly, that President trusted and was
willing to give unprecedented conces-
sions, all without any reliable mecha-
nism to verify whether the nuclear en-
richment had indeed ended.
My Republican colleagues would be
surprised to hear me say this today, es-
pecially today, a week after the anni-
versary of the U.S. decision to pull out
of the Iran nuclear deal. They are right
to be surprised because I am not talk-
ing about Iran; I am talking about
North Korea. I am not talking about
President Barack Obama; I am talking
about Donald Trump.
Donald Trump was willing to sit
down with a criminal dictator and give
away unprecedented concessions in the
hopes that North Korea would abandon
its nuclear program. On the other
hand, he turned his back on Iran, a
large country with a growing moderate
population—roughly 75 million people,
the majority of which, the last I
checked, are under the age of 25—and a
moderate President. Let me be really
clear. There are some bad actors in
Iran, and some of them are in powerful
positions. But, unfortunately, the ac-
tions of this administration, unlike the
actions of the last administration, the
Obama administration—here is what
they sought to do. They sought to di-
minish the extremists, the hardliners,
and their sway over what happens in
Iran and at the same time bolster a
new generation of Iranians who are
growing up, who are more moderate in
nature and, frankly, who would like to
have a better relationship with our
country. Sadly, President Trump
turned his back on Iran and looked for-
ward to taking a different course—a
different course for sure.
Unlike North Korea, Iran committed
2 years ago to unprecedented, invasive
inspections under a deal called JCPOA.
On July 14, 2015, after years of careful
preparation, the Obama administration
began implementing the JCPOA with
Iran and five negotiating partners—
Great Britain, France, Germany, Rus-
sia, and China—in an effort to end
Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons for
years and, possibly, if we are lucky,
forever. The deal was not based on
trust; it was based on mistrust—mis-
trust.
There is a Ronald Reagan line that
says: ‘‘Trust, but verify.’’ That is not
the underlying principle with the Iran
deal, the JCPOA. It is mistrust, but
verify. That is the theme that
underlies the JCPOA.
Under that agreement, Iran was re-
quired to end uranium enrichment for
nuclear purposes and would be subject
to invasive inspections by the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency, the
IAEA. To the surprise of many, they
had apparently held up their end of the
bargain until now.
We pulled out of the JCPOA a year
ago. Our other negotiating partners
stayed in, and the IAEA recently cer-
tified for the 14th time in a row—I
think in February of this year—that
Iran has complied with the terms of
the agreement, the letter and spirit of
the agreement that we pulled out of a
year ago. We are the only one who has
pulled out of it to date. The IAEA itself
says that the inspection regime laid
out by this agreement, the JCPOA, is
the world’s toughest—the world’s
toughest.
Here is the bottom line. Because of
the JCPOA, Iran is much further away
from developing a nuclear weapon
today than it was before the deal was
signed several years ago. However, as I
said earlier, we have not held up our
end of the bargain. One year ago, Presi-
dent Trump announced that this coun-
try would unilaterally leave the
JCPOA, even though the IAEA cer-
tified for the 14th time in a row, this
year, that Iran has complied with the
terms of the agreement. But we pulled
out, leaving our allies, who committed
to the deal in good faith, in the lurch.
This decision we made, I think re-
grettably a year ago, had con-
sequences. Instead of celebrating con-
tinued stability provided by the Iran
nuclear deal last week, Iran’s Presi-
dent, President Rouhani, announced
that Iran will begin to end its compli-
ance with some portions of the JCPOA,
including by stockpiling enriched ura-
nium and heavy water.
As I said at that time, President
Trump’s decision increased the odds of
armed conflict with Iran while doing
nothing to constrain their other mali-
cious activities in the region. Again,
make no mistake. Not everybody in
Iran wants to be our friend. Mostly
young people want to be our friends,
and a lot of folks who have been elect-
ed to office over there would like to
have a friendly, better relationship
with this country. But there are some
who do not, and I fully acknowledge
that.
Today, thanks to President Trump’s
appointment of John Bolton to be our
National Security Advisor—the Presi-
dent’s National Security Advisor—we
are seeing that prediction come truer
than I could have imagined.
Last month, the Trump administra-
tion designated the Iranian Revolu-
tionary Guard as a foreign terrorist or-
ganization, further antagonizing Iran.
Members of the Trump administration
are reportedly mulling over a plan to
refuse to issue sanctions waivers to our
European allies who intend to purchase
oil from Iran, and the administration
has reportedly drawn up plans to send
120,000 of our troops to the Middle East
in response to alleged increased threats
from Iran. But our allies in the region
and around the world, including the
French, the Brits, and the Germans,
say that they have seen no such threat.
All of this is happening in the absence
of a Senate-confirmed Secretary of De-
fense.
Earlier this week, I was out for a run
a couple of miles from here. If you run
from the Capitol down to the Lincoln
Memorial and then turn around and
sort of head back this way, you run by
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
Whenever I run alongside the memo-
rial, I take my left hand, and with my
fingers, I touch the names of 55,000 men
and women who died in that war. I
served with them. I am the last Viet-
nam veteran serving in the Senate.
They died, and many of us risked our
lives over a war that was based—really,
premised—on an untruth; some would
say a lie.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2909
May 16, 2019
In August 1964, then-President Lyn-
don Johnson announced that the North
Vietnamese had engaged the U.S. Navy
in the Gulf of Tonkin, and he asked
Congress to pass a resolution sup-
porting retaliatory attacks. The fol-
lowing day, he added these words to his
request: ‘‘The United States intends no
rashness and seeks no wider war.’’
Those were his words in August 1964.
His administration went on to justify
a bloody, almost decades-long war after
that on the basis of that document—
55,000 of my colleagues, my shipmates,
my fellow marines, our soldiers, our
airmen—55,000—dead.
We had a similar situation in Iraq. It
did not involve the Gulf of Tonkin. It
did not involve ships. It really didn’t
involve the Vietnamese. But there were
allegations and assertions that the
Iraqis were developing weapons of mass
destruction. The President, the Vice
President—in that case, Bush and Che-
ney—the Secretary of Defense, and the
Secretary of State all asserted that the
Iraqis were developing weapons of mass
destruction and called on this Congress
to give the President the power to re-
spond appropriately.
There are 55,000 names on the Viet-
nam memorial wall. There is no wall
for the 4,100 men and women who died
in Iraq after Congress provided Presi-
dent Bush the authority to respond to
the alleged, perceived threat of weap-
ons of mass destruction in Iraq. While
there is no wall on which to write
those 4,100 names, those names are
written in graveyards in every State in
this country—4,100 men, women, some
young and some old, who laid down
their lives on what was really based on
a lie—weapons of mass destruction.
I want to say that lie was chiefly per-
petrated, if I am not mistaken, by a
fellow named John Bolton and that ad-
ministration.
Fast forward to today. We have seen
this movie before. Thanks to John
Bolton’s rash actions in the Mideast, I
can see it happening again.
I don’t want to see it happen again. I
have been to too many funerals of peo-
ple, servicemembers from Delaware,
who died in Iraq. I don’t want to go to
any more. I don’t want to have to visit
any more spouses, children, parents,
brothers, and sisters, as we have done
in recent years with families who have
been crushed by sorrow flowing from
our engagement in Iraq.
John Bolton has agitated for war
with Iran for over a decade. He even
wrote an op-ed about it. The op-ed was
entitled: ‘‘To Stop Iran’s Bomb, Bomb
Iran.’’
Under Mr. Bolton’s leadership, the
Trump administration’s Iran policy is
becoming ever more dangerous and
ever more isolated from our traditional
allies. This strategy could very well
plunge us into another foreign war, if
not corrected.
This needless escalation is no way to
conduct our foreign policy or to safe-
guard our national security. What is
more, the administration’s actions
with respect to Iran haven’t just in-
creased the odds of an armed conflict.
They have also damaged the credibility
of our country around the world. If the
United States cannot be trusted to up-
hold our commitments to those with
whom we negotiate, there is little rea-
son to believe that other countries, let
alone nuclear-armed ones like North
Korea, would be willing to negotiate
with us in good faith.
Now, there is another option here.
Yesterday former U.S. Ambassador
Wendy Sherman published an op-ed in
the New York Times in which she
wrote the following:
But war is not inevitable. President Trump
campaigned on bringing troops home, not
sending tens of thousands more to the Mid-
dle East. Such a deployment, although inad-
equate for a full-scale war, is more than fool-
ish. War in the Middle East, as we should
have learned by now, is neither swift to end
nor sure to achieve its purpose.
Reformists in Iran have expressed an
interest in diplomatic solutions with
the United States and our allies, in-
cluding a possible prisoner exchange.
The foreign minister of Iran, whom I
first met a dozen years or so ago at the
Iranian Ambassador’s residence in New
York City—not the Ambassador to the
United States but the Ambassador to
the United Nations, a fellow name
Javad Zarif. It turned out that when I
met him, I was impressed with how
well-spoken he was. It turns out he had
gone to undergraduate school at San
Francisco State, I believe, in Cali-
fornia. He is a really smart guy. He is
not only well spoken but knew a lot
about America and spoke English as
well as any of us in the room. He went
to graduate school in Denver, CO, and
he ended up here as the Iranian Ambas-
sador to the United Nations.
Later, when Ahmadinejab left of-
fice—Ahmadinejab was a bad guy, a
really bad guy, and was President of
Iran before Ruhani—Ahmadinejab sent
Zarif back home, got him out of the
United States, got him back to Iran,
and he sort of disappeared until the
new elections. Ruhani emerged as the
more moderate—kind of a Gorbachev-
type guy, really—leader in Iran and
said: Zarif, I would like you to be my
foreign minister. That is like being
their Secretary of State, a position
that he still holds.
Not long ago, about a couple of weeks
ago, in that role, he suggested that we
do a prisoner swap. We hold a number
of people of Iranian descent who are in
this country. They hold about a half
dozen or so of our folks, I think mostly
with dual citizenship, in their country.
Foreign Minister Zarif said: Why don’t
we just do a straight-out prisoner
swap?
That would actually be a good start
to maybe tamping down the rhetoric
and to see if we can’t find common
ground with Iran again.
During the 8 years of previous admin-
istrations, our foreign policy was de-
signed to strengthen the standing of
the moderates in Iran and to under-
mine the power of the hard-liners in
that country. Actually, it worked—not
perfectly, but it worked. The elections
that they conducted a couple of years
ago—6 years ago—reflect that.
Sadly, this administration—I can’t
believe they did it intentionally, but
their policy in the last just 2 years or
a little over 2 years—what they have
done is to undermine the effectiveness
and the standing of the moderates in
Iran, and they have rallied support of
Iran around the extremists and around
the hard-liners. It is just the opposite
of what was done in the last adminis-
tration.
We have to be smarter than that. We
have to be smarter than this. When I
think about the contrast between the
Trump administration’s actions in
North Korea and Iran, I can’t help but
wonder why there is such a stark con-
trast? I would not trust the leader of
North Korea any further than I could
throw him, and for this President to
embrace this guy and to trust him in
ways that befuddle me—and, I think, a
lot of other folks, including folks in his
party—is beyond me.
But why has this administration
been so determined to abrogate a care-
fully crafted deal that keeps Iran from
obtaining a nuclear weapon? Why will
President Trump not work to ensure
the freedom of Americans held in Iran?
Well, part of the answer is provided by
Thomas Friedman, a highly regarded
famous journalist whose column ap-
pears from time to time in national
newspapers.
Tom Friedman wrote, a year or so
ago, something called the ‘‘Trump Doc-
trine.’’ I think it provides an answer to
the question: Why has President
Trump been so determined to get us
out of the JCPOA and to embrace a
leader like the one we have over in
North Korea?
The ‘‘Trump Doctrine’’ from Tom
Friedman goes something like this. He
said: ‘‘Obama built it, I broke it’’—‘‘I,’’
being Trump—‘‘you’’—including us
here in this body—‘‘fix it.’’ That is it.
‘‘Obama built it, I’’—Donald Trump—
‘‘broke it—you’’—the rest of us—‘‘fix
it.’’
I think my colleagues would agree
that it would be a travesty if the Presi-
dent’s determination to destroy Presi-
dent Obama’s achievement—an
achievement shared by others in this
country and by our allies and friends
in, among other places, Britain,
France, and Germany—but our Presi-
dent’s determination to destroy Barack
Obama’s achievement, the achieve-
ments of his administration—in this
case, the Iran nuclear deal—led us into
another endless war in the Middle East.
I urge President Trump, as he has
done in the case of North Korea, to en-
gage in diplomacy and ratchet down
tensions with Iran, rather than engag-
ing in needless provocation.
Mr. President, you meet with the
President more than I do, but some of
the times I have been with him in the
last 2 years, whenever he mentions

George W. Bush, in the same breath he
talks about how he got us into a war
that cost us thousands of lives and has
cost literally tens of billions of dol-
lars—the Iraq war. So that would sug-
gest to me that the idea of drawing
more troops and a whole lot more
money into a war with Iran has to be
something you do with care.
So on this 1-year anniversary of the
Trump administration’s pulling out of
the Iran deal—I think, foolishly doing
so—I would urge the President and his
advisers to think carefully about what
outcomes we really seek as a country.
We should be prioritizing diplomacy at
this time, not escalating tensions and
risking war with American lives with
no coherent strategy. It is my hope
that cooler heads will prevail. It is also
in America’s best interest that they do.
John Kennedy said a lot of things
that are memorable, and one of my fa-
vorites is this: ‘‘Never negotiate out of
fear, but never be afraid to negotiate.’’
‘‘Never negotiate out of fear, but
never be afraid to negotiate.’’ I think
we would be wise to remember those
words with respect to Iran.
The last thing I would say to the Pre-
siding Officer, who is former military,
is this. When I finish speaking, you are
going to be succeeded by a Marine colo-
nel who serves here from Alaska. We
know people we serve with people who
have given their lives up in combat in
wars far away around the world.
We are very proud in Delaware. The
Dover Air Force Base may be the best
airlift base in the world. There are 5,000
or 6,000 people who work there, mostly
uniformed, and big planes, C–5s and C–
17s. Maybe it is the best airlift base in
the world.
Dover Air Force Base is also home to
a mortuary. A month ago, the bodies of
three marines, one of whom is from
Delaware, were brought back to this
country. In this case, their vehicle in
Afghanistan was blown up by a road-
side bomb, and we lost three of them
just like that. They are not the first,
and, sadly, they will not be the last
members of our Armed Services to
come home.
For one of the marines, Christopher
Slutman, his body came home to his
wife Shannon and to their three daugh-
ters, ages 4, 8, and 10. I have seen this
movie before. I have seen it at Dover
Air Force Base with countless bodies
that have come back from overseas. I
think about those kids every day, and
I am sure my colleagues think about
the men and the women from their
States who have served, in some cases,
with great courage and valor. But the
idea that 55,000 of those colleagues of
mine who served in Vietnam in a war
that was premised on a lie and 4,100 are
buried in graveyards all over this coun-
try—we have to be smarter than that.
We owe it to not just the families of
those men and women who have died
but to the ones who serve today and
their families.
‘‘Never negotiate out of fear, but
never be afraid to negotiate.’’
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska is recognized.
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I am
down here on the floor to do what I
typically do on Thursday, which is talk
about an Alaskan who is making a big
difference in my State, somebody I
refer to as the Alaskan of the Week.
But, you know, this is the Senate and
we have debates, and we are respectful
in our debates, and there is no one in
the Senate I respect more than my
friend from Delaware, Senator CAR-
PER—his service in Vietnam and as a
captain in the Navy. When he speaks, I
listen, and I have respect. But I actu-
ally thought, very briefly—it wasn’t
what I was planning on doing, but I was
just listening to someone I respect—I
thought I would offer a bit of a counter
view for those watching in the Gallery
or on TV on what he just talked about.
It is a really important issue, but I
just happen to respectfully disagree
with most—not everything, but most—
of what my colleague just mentioned.
So I am just going to touch on that be-
fore I talk about an Alaskan who is
doing great work.
Just listening to my colleague talk
about President Trump’s turning his
back on Iran, the sanctions that we
placed on Iran, which we all voted for
here in the Senate, are antagonizing
Iran. Foreign Minister Zarif is a mod-
erate. Well, let me just touch on that.
I think there is this new narrative that
is starting to come out from my col-
leagues, and, again, I have a lot of re-
spect for my good friend from Dela-
ware, but about this kind of blame
America first, blame Trump, as if the
generals and admirals weren’t advising
him, and that Iran is some kind of this
new innocent moderate that we are
turning our back on and we are sanc-
tioning them and antagonizing them.
With all due respect to my colleague on
the other of the aisle, this couldn’t be
further from the truth. Iran is no inno-
cent. Iran is no innocent at all.
Iran is the biggest state sponsor of
terrorism in the world and has been for
decades. As for the JCPOA, which my
colleague is lamenting, I read that. I
certainly dug into that. I have been in-
volved in our broader Iran isolation
policy for many years. That was the
first major foreign policy national se-
curity agreement in U.S. history that
had a bipartisan majority of Senators
and a bipartisan majority of House
Members who were against it—against
it, not for it. That did not have support
in this body—certainly not in the Sen-
ate, not in the House, and not from the
American people.
So as for this myth that somehow
this was this great agreement, it
wasn’t. It was a giveaway—billions to
the largest state sponsor of terrorism,
where in 10 years they are free to go
develop nuclear weapons. This was not
a good agreement, and this body said
so. A bipartisan majority in the House
and the Senate disagreed with Presi-
dent Obama. A partisan minority in
the House and Senate, for the first
time in U.S. history, on a national se-
curity agreement of this magnitude,
somehow passed it.
So there is this myth that this was
supported by Congress. It wasn’t.
Democrats and Republicans opposed
it—the majority in both Houses. And
by the American people, it certainly
wasn’t.
Remember, this is the country that,
after the deal and during the deal, con-
tinued to say what? We want to wipe
Israel off the map. It is not a really
nice, innocent nation saying that: We
want to wipe Israel off the map. They
continue to say that.
Here is the final thing. In my 4 years
in the Senate, I have only heard one
other U.S. Senator—Senator COTTON
from Arkansas—even talk about this
issue.
Starting in 2004, 2005, I was a staff of-
ficer, as a marine, to the commander of
U.S. Central Command, and there was
top-secret information that started to
show in the region—and we were out
there a lot, the Middle East—that the
Iranians were supplying the Iraqi Shia
militia with very sophisticated impro-
vised explosive devices that were kill-
ing our soldiers and our marines and
our sailors. The Iranians, of course, de-
nied it. They were lying.
It all came out to be true. These were
infrared tripwires, explosively formed
projectiles that could punch through
anything—Abrams tanks, humvees—
and if you were an American soldier
and you got hit by one of these, you
were pretty much dead.
I asked the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff in an open Armed Serv-
ices Committee hearing how many
American military members were
killed by these Iranian IEDs, and over
2,000 was his answer—2,000. I have never
heard any of my colleagues talk about
that.
So the notion that Foreign Minister
Zarif was a moderate when he was ne-
gotiating with Secretary Kerry is
belied by the facts. This Foreign min-
ister literally had the blood of Amer-
ican soldiers on his hands.
So I take these issues very seriously,
like my colleague from Delaware does.
There is this notion that our allies
were all for the JCPOA. They weren’t.
Some of our most important allies—
Israel, the Gulf Arab States, which we
have been allies with for decades—were
adamantly opposed, and they are the
closest to Iran.
So this notion that we are going to
blame the administration—by the way,
we keep talking about President
Trump. He is getting advice from sea-
soned generals and admirals to rein-
force our military presence in the re-
gion because they see threats.
In the media right now, there is this
narrative that the President is trying
to drum up a war. What about the gen-
erals? What about General Dunford, a
very well respected marine and Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs? Are they
doing this?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2911
May 16, 2019
I just came from reading some of the
intel in the SCIF that is prompting
this discussion. Of course, I can’t talk
about it, but I support what the admin-
istration is doing with regard to rein-
forcing our military capabilities in the
region, and this is the reason: It sends
a message to Iran that if they are
going to try to do what they did in
2004, 2005, and 2006, which is kill and
wound thousands of our military mem-
bers, we are going to have the capa-
bility to make them pay.
I don’t like seeing anyone coming
through Dover Air Force Base, either,
but over 2,000 of our troops were killed
and wounded by these leaders of the
largest state sponsor of terrorism in
the world. The notion that somehow
they are some kind of innocent country
that we are antagonizing or ‘‘turning
our back on’’ is not accurate. So watch
out for the new narrative that the Ira-
nians are the innocents and that some-
how we are being provocative. What is
provocative is killing our troops, which
they have a long history of doing—in
Lebanon, the marines—and we need to
send a signal that if they are going to
look at doing this again or trying to or
trying to kill our diplomats, it is not
going to be so easy this time.
I support what is happening there,
and I hope my colleagues will.
We are going to get a briefing by the
Secretary of State, the Secretary of
Defense, and the CIA next week on
this, which I think is appropriate. Let’s
remember who the real bad guys are.
We are Americans. Yes, we have polit-
ical differences, but somehow, if we
start to make this narrative that Iran
is the innocent and somehow the
Trump guys—John Bolton, for exam-
ple—are some kind of evil people—
come on. Come on, really? The largest
state sponsor of terrorism, responsible
for killing and maiming and wounding
thousands of American soldiers, the
best and brightest in our country, and
we are the bad guys? I don’t think so.
So watch out for that narrative. I
certainly hope it is not going to be
something my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle start getting out there.
It is already in the media. You have
the former negotiator for President
Obama making these statements that,
somehow, poor Iran; all-bad America. I
am not a big ‘‘blame America first’’
member, and I think we need to be
really careful when we talk about try-
ing to demonize our generals, admirals,
and national security advisers and
make the Iranians look like they are
some kind of innocents when they are
not.
I wish more of my colleagues would
talk about the number of dead military
members killed and wounded by the
Quds Force in Iran, because they never
do. No one here ever talks about it.
Amnesia.
(Thereupon, Mr. SCOTT of Florida as-
sumed the Chair.)
TRIBUTE TO ANGIE FRAIZE
Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier,
it is Thursday afternoon, and it is the
time I get to talk about an Alaskan
who has given of themselves in order to
make my State the great place that it
is. We call this person the Alaskan of
the Week.
I like to come down to the floor—and
I am not going to take a poll, but I
think it is the pages’ favorite speech of
the week—because I get to talk about
Alaska and somebody who has really
made a difference for the community,
the State, or maybe even the country.
I like to talk about what is going on
in Alaska because I love to encourage
people to come and visit our great
State.
Right now, what is going on in Alas-
ka? Well, sunset time is approaching
midnight in many places across the
State. In Anchorage, the Sun officially
rose at 5:06 a.m. and will set at 10:42
p.m., but twilight starts at 4 a.m. and
ends at midnight. So the Midnight Sun
is burning bright all across Alaska. In
the summer, we are hit with this fren-
zied energy because of this beautiful
Midnight Sun in the sky. You will find
many of us up late playing softball,
doing yard work, fishing, painting
houses, talking to our neighbors. So it
is a great time to be in Alaska. I urge
everybody here in the Gallery to come
on up.
The Presiding Officer also has a great
State to visit, the State of Florida. So
go down to Florida, and then you can
take the 4,000-mile trip to Alaska. You
will have a great time. Make your trav-
el plans now.
As you know, what makes my State
or your State truly great is not the
hours of Sun it gets—and the Presiding
Officer’s State does get a lot of Sun
too—or its glorious mountains or spar-
kling seas, all of which we have in
Alaska in spades; it is the people who
help build strong families, strong com-
munities, strong cities, and a strong
State.
The person I want to honor today is
Anchorage Police Officer Angie Fraize,
our Alaskan of the Week.
I think it is very appropriate that we
are celebrating our police forces across
the country, all across America. There
were many thousands in DC this week
because they are a force for good in our
communities who often go
unappreciated.
I got to speak last Friday at the An-
chorage police memorial ceremony,
and it was a very somber event. We
have a big memorial there of all the
first responders and law enforcement
officers who have been killed in the
line of duty in Alaska over the last 100-
plus years.
As I mentioned, all jobs are impor-
tant, no doubt about it, but there is
something special, something noble,
and something even sacred, I would
say, about a job that entails protecting
others and putting your life on the line
to keep your fellow citizens safe.
This week, I thought it would be fit-
ting to honor Anchorage Police Officer
Fraize. She is one of more than 400
sworn police officers, brave men and
women who keep the 300,000 residents
of Anchorage, AK—my hometown—
safe. Let me tell you a little bit about
Officer Fraize, what makes her so spe-
cial, and why my friend and fellow ma-
rine, Anchorage Police Chief Justin
Doll, recommended her.
Officer Fraize was raised in Butte, in
Palmer, on 12 acres of land. She did not
have an easy childhood. She grew up in
a house with no running water and no
electricity. Her father was an alcoholic
who died in a motorcycle accident
when she was just 12 years old, so her
mom raised her and her brother by her-
self. Her mom was a tenacious, hard-
working mother—a characteristic she
clearly passed on to her daughter. She
worked her way through college with
her two young children to support and
at the age of 40 got her degree in edu-
cation from the University of Alaska in
Anchorage.
This is Officer Fraize’s mom. You see
where she gets her good genes.
Times were tough. Money was tight.
They often had to shower at the uni-
versity. Their car was always breaking
down. They were always struggling to
make it, but they always did make
ends meet—a family struggling and
barely making it.
None of that dimmed Officer Fraize’s
dream of catching the bad guys—a
dream she had since seventh grade. She
graduated with honors from high
school and was able to attend the Uni-
versity of Washington when she was
only 16 years old—very smart. Her first
job out of college was as a residential
youth counselor working with adoles-
cent sex offenders who had mental
health issues. So right away, she was in
the law enforcement area.
When her husband was offered a job
with the Anchorage PD, she decided at
that time that she, too, wanted to be a
police officer.
Officer Fraize has had various duties
in the 12 years she has worked as an
Anchorage police officer. She has been
a police officer, a coordinator for the
academy, and now she is a recruiter
particularly focused on recruiting
young women and spreading the word
about how great APD is. So if you want
an adventure and you want to come to
Alaska and you like law enforcement,
give her a call.
All the jobs Officer Fraize has had re-
quire empathy. She said her life experi-
ences have given her that empathy.
Chronic alcoholics, she said, don’t
wake up every day choosing to drink.
People who act badly don’t wake up
wanting to be bad people. The trick,
she said, is to listen to people, to find
a connection, and to see the humanity
in each individual.
She is also incredibly passionate
about connecting police officers with
the people they protect, so she chairs a
group called Anchorage Cops for Com-
munity, where the police officers inter-
act with the public in positive ways at
coffee shops, community council meet-
ings, and public events throughout An-
chorage. This gives the community a

chance to interact with officers in a
positive way. It also gives police offi-
cers a chance to get their fresh per-
spectives from community members.
On Tuesday, for instance, the cops
and firefighters got together for an eat-
ing relay at a local barbecue res-
taurant in Anchorage. Members of the
community came out to cheer their fa-
vorite police officer and fireman. The
proceeds went to Special Olympics
Alaska, which is another passion of
hers.
Officer Fraize is a great champion of
advocating for those with special
needs. She and her husband have two
daughters: Italia, who is 14 years old,
and Gianna, who is 10. Gianna has
Down syndrome and, according to Offi-
cer Fraize, is the most popular girl in
her fourth grade class. That is no sur-
prise.
Officer Fraize is the chair of a local
group that advocates for individuals
with special needs, and she is also in-
volved in the Special Olympics Law
Enforcement Torch Run, which is a
great event that so many in our com-
munity get behind. She was one of 50
police officers in America chosen to
carry the torch at the 2019 Special
Olympics World Summer Games in Abu
Dhabi. She brought the torch home to
Alaska, and she is giving it to Special
Olympics in Alaska this weekend at
the 2019 Alaska Law Enforcement
Torch Run and Pledge Drive. This is
going to be a great event.
Anchorage Police Chief Justin Doll
said:
We are so proud of Officer Fraize’s work at
the APD, and I believe the rest of Anchorage
should be as well. She is the epitome of the
public servant ideal that is the foundation of
our relationship with the Anchorage commu-
nity. I am genuinely honored to have her at
APD upholding our most cherished tradi-
tions of community service.
That is the Anchorage police chief.
We are also proud of all our police of-
ficers and first responders in Alaska.
We are so grateful for the work they do
to keep us safe. We want them to know
that we honor their jobs and their com-
mitment to our community. We also
honor their families. These are very
tough jobs, and it is hard on supportive
families when a wife or husband goes
off every morning to a job that could
involve risking their lives.
We want them to know, not just in
Alaska but here in the Senate, we have
their backs.
To Officer Fraize, thanks for all that
you do. We are so lucky to have offi-
cers like you in Alaska, looking out for
us. Thank you for being our Alaskan of
the Week.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am
going to take this time to speak about
Russia. But if I might, following up on
the point by the Senator from Alaska,
first, I want to applaud the police offi-
cer you are honoring this week.
This is National Police Week. I think
it is very appropriate that we recognize
those who are serving our country and
our community as first responders.
I want to mention two police officers
specifically, both of whom gave their
lives in defense of our community.
These law enforcement officers were
young, and they went into danger rath-
er than running away from danger. We
lost two of our officers last year.
Amy Sorrells Caprio from Baltimore
County, my home jurisdiction, a mem-
ber of the Baltimore County Police De-
partment, died before reaching the age
of 30, pursuing a burglary suspect who
struck and killed her with the vehicle
being operated by the suspect. She
leaves behind a husband, parents, and
sister. Our prayers are with her.
The second police officer I would like
to honor is Mujahid Abdul Mumin
Ramzziddin, a 51-year-old police officer
from Prince George’s County, MD,
close to where we are right here. He
was off duty, and he observed the need
to help a person who was a victim of
domestic violence. He went to help
that person and was ultimately killed
by the perpetrator.
He leaves behind a wife and four chil-
dren, and our prayers are also with
him.
RUSSIA
Mr. President, I rise today to address
the continuously abusive nature of the
Russian Government in impeding on
the human rights of its people and the
people across the globe. From inter-
ference in democratic processes around
the globe to its malign influence in
Syria, to its continued aggression
against Ukraine, Mr. Putin’s regime
must be held accountable for its
crimes.
As we all know, Vladimir Putin has
been openly and willfully attacking
democratic institutions and processes
to corrode good governance and our
values. His tools are drawn from a So-
viet-era playbook but are constantly
being updated with improvements. He
is a pusher—constantly pushing the
limits of acceptable international be-
havior and then going over the line. We
cannot overlook the phenomenon that
is unfolding across the European con-
tinent, the wider region, and now, yes,
here in our Western Hemisphere.
Just a few weeks ago, Special Coun-
sel Robert Mueller released to the pub-
lic a redacted version of his report on
Russia’s interference in our 2016 Presi-
dential election, revealing another one
of Mr. Putin’s plots to interfere with
and tarnish the democratic process of a
strong nation. Special Counsel Mueller
described the Russian effort as taking
place in a ‘‘sweeping and systematic
fashion,’’ a premeditated attack by the
Kremlin.
Russia’s aggression on the inter-
national stage continues to grow and is
deserving of global condemnation. The
United States is just one of many na-
tions targeted by the Putin regime
whose democracy was and is system-
ically targeted and attacked.
It certainly was not the first nation
to be targeted. Reflect back to its ille-
gal invasion of Ukraine and subsequent
annexation of Crimea. Look at Russia’s
role in the ongoing hostilities in East-
ern Europe. Consider Mr. Putin’s role
in Syria’s civil war and support for dic-
tator Bashar al-Assad. He murdered
hundreds of thousands of citizens and
assisted in the collapse the country’s
infrastructure. Russia has shown us
time and again its disdain for inter-
national laws and norms under Mr.
Putin’s leadership.
After the trifecta of Russian inter-
ference in Ukraine, Syria, and our
democratic Presidential election here,
I partnered with nine bipartisan col-
leagues within the first week of the
115th Congress in January of 2017 to in-
troduce the Countering Russian Hos-
tilities Act. It is comprehensive sanc-
tions legislation on Russia in response
to its cyber intrusion, aggression, and
destabilizing activities in the United
States, Ukraine, Syria, and worldwide.
Over time, we learned that Mr.
Putin’s increasing aggressive behavior
abroad is directly related to his need to
maintain power at home.
In January of 2018, I released a For-
eign Relations Committee Democratic
member report that documented Mr.
Putin’s pattern of asymmetric warfare
against democratic institutions, uni-
versal values, and the rule of law in
Russia and across Europe over the last
20 years. The report details the tools
the Russian Government has repeat-
edly deployed and perfected, as well as
its techniques to attack democracies
both internally and abroad.
Among many other takeaways, we
learned that Mr. Putin will continue to
simultaneously step up his attacks on
democracies around the world while
also acting to maintain power in Rus-
sia.
We have also learned that it is ulti-
mately the Russian people who bear
the brunt of Mr. Putin’s international
decisions. We have an obligation to
support human rights around the
globe, both as individuals and as a na-
tion. Part of that obligation is ensur-
ing that violators of international
human rights are held accountable for
their actions and are not given the re-
sources they need to continue their ne-
farious actions.
In an effort to address these obliga-
tions, I was fortunate to work closely
with the late Senator from Arizona,
John McCain, on the Sergei Magnitsky
Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012.
As you may know, Sergei Magnitsky
was a Moscow-based lawyer who brave-
ly uncovered deep-rooted, high-level
corruption in Russia over a decade ago.
Like any good lawyer, he reported his
discoveries to the authorities. For
doing his job, he was arrested, jailed,
tortured, and killed in prison. When I
learned about Sergei’s life and work

human rights and rampant impunity
that met the perpetrators of these

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2913
May 16, 2019
Originally, the Sergei Magnitsky
Rule of Law Accountability Act pro-
vides that anyone involved in Sergei’s
imprisonment, torture, or death who
has not been brought to justice in Rus-
sia would be denied access to our finan-
cial system or the ability to travel to
our country. The bill also targets those
who have abused their power in the
country to violate the human rights of
anyone in Russia who disagrees with
Mr. Putin’s corrupt regime.
Senator McCain and I wanted to send
a signal to Mr. Putin and his co-
conspirators that there will be con-
sequences for their actions and their
inactions. The Sergei Magnitsky Act
was, is, and will continue to be an ef-
fective tool at doing just that.
Senator McCain and I agreed that the
United States must lead the world by
using the power of our financial and
legal institutions to hold human rights
abusers and corrupt individuals across
the globe accountable for their crimes.
That is why we continued to work to-
gether to author the Global Magnitsky
Human Rights Accountability Act,
which was signed into law in 2016. Sen-
ator McCain and I shared the critically
important belief that the value of
American leadership in enforcing
human rights worldwide transcends
party lines.
I might point out that following the
U.S. example, other countries have en-
acted similar laws to make sure we
have a blanket protection against
those who commit these human rights
violations.
In the past year, Global Magnitsky
designations have targeted individuals
around the world responsible for acts of
genocide, violence, and significant cor-
ruption. My colleagues and I have
called for numerous sanctions under
this act, and I am pleased that the ad-
ministration has acted, particularly
issuing Executive order 13818, which ex-
panded Global Magnitsky authorities.
Freezing the financial assets of per-
petrators and denying them visas to
the United States sends a clear mes-
sage: We will not stand by while indi-
viduals are stripped of their freedoms
and their rights.
Unfortunately, while the Global
Magnitsky legislation has proved
hugely successful, we continue to wit-
ness human rights violations around
the world and, more specifically, at the
hands of Mr. Putin.
In recent reports, human rights
groups have noted that the number of
political prisoners in Russia has risen
at a rapid rate over the past few years.
Many of these groups are calling on the
United States to impose sanctions on
more Russian officials to hold them ac-
countable for the inhumane treatment
of over 250 reported political prisoners.
Unfortunately, this issue of Russian
political prisoners has not been the
forefront of the U.S.-Russia discus-
sions. That needs to change.
President Trump continues to treat
Mr. Putin with the utmost respect, de-
spite the Russian President’s holding
almost 300 individuals hostage as polit-
ical prisoners in Russia.
Most recently, the President has
scheduled another formal meeting with
Mr. Putin next month during the an-
nual G20 Summit. Of course, Secretary
Pompeo just met with Mr. Putin on
Tuesday. Human rights must be on the
agenda for such talks.
In 2016, a Russian human rights ac-
tivist and a person who has dissented
from Mr. Putin, Vladimir Kara-Murza,
testified before the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee, expressing how the
United States could help Russian de-
fenders.
He stated:
Our friends in the West often ask how they
can be helpful to the cause of human rights
and democracy in Russia and the answer to
this is very simple. Please stay true to your
values. We are not asking for your support.
It is our task to fight for democracy and rule
of law in our country. The only thing we ask
from Western leaders is that they stop sup-
porting Mr. Putin by treating him as a re-
spectable and worthy partner and by allow-
ing Mr. Putin’s cronies to use Western coun-
tries as havens for their looted wealth.
That is exactly what the Magnitsky
Act is all about—to deny that legit-
imacy.
I ask that we take these words to
heart. The threat that Russia poses to
our global community has never been
more evident. But we must remember
the distinction between Mr. Putin’s re-
gime and the Russian people. The Rus-
sian people are good, freedom-seeking
people who want economic security and
stability for their families just as we
do in the United States. This is an im-
portant distinction for us to keep in
our minds and our hearts as we con-
tinue to pursue effective tools to
counter Mr. Putin’s threats to the
international order and the values we
hold so dear.
So as we work to shape U.S. policy
and diplomatic strategies toward Rus-
sia, I urge my colleagues to keep in
mind the aspirations of the Russian
human rights defenders who risk their
lives in order to advocate for a Russia
free of authoritarian and abusive lead-
ers.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

THE MIDDLE EAST
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, dominant
in the news—on which I have expected
there to be more coverage—is a matter
that I think is of great urgency to the
country, global security, and peace—
that being the tensions that are rising
in the Middle East.
I have heard a few of my colleagues
speak on the floor about it today, and
I have seen a lot of press report on it,
some of it absurd and some of it on
point. I understand some of it. I
thought there should have been more
information provided to all of the
Members. I am pleased to see that
more will be available next week when
we return. This is an item I have been
talking about for a couple of weeks—of
the urgent threat, potentially, that
now exists from Iran against the
United States, particularly in Iraq but
throughout the Persian Gulf region.
First, let me talk about the threat.
To understand the threat, it is impor-
tant to understand how Iran operates.
Iran is an Islamic republic, meaning
it has a political branch of its govern-
ment—a President, a Foreign Minister,
and a parliamentary body. Then it has
a Supreme Leader, who ultimately gov-
erns the country. In essence, his com-
mands overrule the political branches.
That is why they call him the Supreme
Leader. He is a religious figure. As part
of that, it has an armed services—an
army, a navy, and an air force—that
protects the country, theoretically.
Then it has an armed forces that is
independent of the army, the navy, and
the air force, and that is the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps, IRGC.
First of all, it doesn’t answer to the
President; it doesn’t answer to the For-
eign Minister; and it doesn’t answer to
regular army forces. It answers di-
rectly to the Supreme Leader. A lot of
times, people don’t understand this.
They ascribe to other countries the at-
tributes of our own.
The President of Iran is not the com-
mander in chief, in reality, of the
IRGC. It operates completely sepa-
rately. By the way, that means that
the IRGC—the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps—can oftentimes operate
and do things that the Foreign Min-
ister, who is the spokesperson for the
Iranian Government, may not even
know about. Sometimes it does.
The point is that we have to under-
stand that dynamic. It is not the
United States. Our attributes should
not be assigned to them.
The IRGC has an organization within
it. It has a unit called the Quds Force.
The Quds Force, led by General
Soleimani, is made up of experts and
has developed expertise in unconven-
tional warfare and in intelligence ac-
tivities, primarily abroad. This is the
organization, for example, that helped
to build all of the IEDs that killed and
maimed American servicemen in Iraq.
This is the organization behind the
Shia militias in Iraq today. This is the
organization behind a lot of the efforts
that support Hezbollah in Syria and in
other parts of the world.
The IRGC’s Quds Force is designed to
do things that have some level of
deniability. The IRGC Quds Force has
developed an ability, in the case of con-
flict with the United States—and we
have known this now for the better
part of a decade—to attack us using
proxies, meaning other groups, in order
to escape and have some level of
deniability. It will get some group that

it has stood up, that it has equipped,
and that it has trained to attack us in
retaliation for something America has
done, but it can deny it. It can say:
That wasn’t our army. That wasn’t our
air force. That was this other group
that did it on its own.
This is a capability we know it has
built not just in the Middle East, by
the way, but all over the world. We
have been aware of it for a long time.
It is not a secret to anyone, and it is a
capability that it has increasingly per-
fected.
What has happened here very re-
cently is there has been a persistent
and clear stream of information—a
clear indication—that has arrived to
American policymakers that the IRGC,
the Quds Force, and their proxies in
the region pose a serious and poten-
tially imminent threat to U.S. forces
and U.S. civilians in Iraq and in the
broader Middle East.
The President of the United States
and the administration are confronted
with this information. What is the
wholly appropriate thing for them to
do? The appropriate thing for them to
do is to reposition military assets to
the region, No. 1, to protect the Ameri-
cans who are there in case they come
under attack and, No. 2, to be in a posi-
tion to retaliate.
The reason this is important is you
hope to deter this sort of attack. What
you are hoping to do is to show them
that we have military capabilities in
the region so that if we are attacked by
their proxies at the direction of the
Quds Force, we are going to respond to
that forcefully. What you hope that
will do, along with public messaging, is
get into their heads and make them de-
cide ‘‘We are not going to do this.’’
That is what has happened here, and it
is wholly appropriate.
For a moment, I want you to imag-
ine. If, in fact, an attack such as this
occurred and if, God forbid, hundreds of
Americans were killed, the first ques-
tion everybody would have is, Why
didn’t we have military assets in the
region to protect them? Why couldn’t
we get them out? That is the first ques-
tion everyone around here is going to
ask.
What the administration has done to
pre-position military assets in the re-
gion for this potential contingency is
entirely appropriate. Also appropriate
is the notion that we are not going to
start a war, but if we are attacked by
Iran’s proxies, we are going to respond
against those proxies, and we are going
to hold Iran responsible. It is going to
pay a price for this as well. Who could
disagree with the notion that if we are
attacked, we have a right to defend
ourselves and respond? That is the only
thing that is happening here.
I am pleased that in the last day,
more Members of the Senate have been
made privy to this stream of informa-
tion so that people can begin to see
that the actions the administration
has taken up to this point are not just
wholly justified but are appropriate.
Yet I am concerned about some of the
reactions I have seen with regard to
this because I think they bode ill both
for this case and for the future.
One of the first reactions I have seen
is that this is not true, that they are
literally making it up, that there is no
such intelligence, and that it is being
exaggerated. There are even some
leakers—I don’t know who these people
are—who are lying to media outlets
about the contents of this intelligence
because they have axes to grind
against somebody else in the adminis-
tration, and they want to create em-
barrassment.
Look, I get this bureaucratic infight-
ing, but I don’t understand it when it
comes to issues of national security.
Even if this information is 50 percent
accurate, we have an obligation to err
on the side of caution, especially when
American lives are on the line.
I encourage all Senators to read this
information or access it through their
offices and, obviously, when we have a
briefing with the appropriate officials,
to attend that as well, and I believe
you will agree with me.
The second thing I am hearing is
‘‘Oh, this is just a path to war’’—equat-
ing this to the Iraq war of over a dec-
ade ago. This is nothing like that. That
was an offensive operation. That was
an invasion of another country. This is
not posturing for a military attack;
this is military posturing for the pur-
poses of defensive operations. As I have
said repeatedly, it is very straight-
forward: If Iran attacks, there will be a
war. If Iran does not attack, there will
not be a war.
I think the most disappointing is
some insinuation, including by Mem-
bers of this body—publicly and pri-
vately—that somehow, we are going to
provoke an attack; that elements of
the American Government are going to
go out and do something to get Iran to
hit us so that we will have an excuse to
go to war. I don’t know how you prove
a negative, but I find that to be wholly
unsubstantiated and dangerous.
Let me tell you why this is problem-
atic. What encourages Iran to believe it
can get away with this is that it be-
lieves if one of these groups—one of the
Shia militias in Iraq—attacks us, it is
going to be able to say that it is ‘‘not
us,’’ that it is some rogue group that
did it. ‘‘Don’t hold us responsible for
it.’’ The more Iran thinks it can get
away with that, the more likely it is to
do it. So it is important that this be
exposed for what it is.
The second reason Iran thinks it can
get away with it is I think it believes
it can exploit our political divisions. I
think Iran reads these newspapers and
watches the news and realizes that
some percentage of Americans and,
certainly, a significant percentage of
Americans in politics is going to, in
some way, take Iran’s side on this.
People are going to say that we pro-
voked it—that this is our fault, that we
did something that made Iran mad,
that we created the tensions that led
to this—or that the intelligence was
flawed or that it wasn’t Iran but one of
these other groups.
By the way, the more of that Iran
reads, the likelier it is to do this. That
doesn’t mean I don’t believe we can
have a legitimate debate. I support des-
ignating the IRGC as a terrorist orga-
nization. We can have a legitimate de-
bate about whether that should have
been done but not right now. Right
now, Americans potentially stand in
harm’s way, and they need the United
States of America to be supporting ef-
forts to defend and to protect them.
Here is what I know none of us can
disagree with, I hope: No. 1, that if
there is any serious indication that
Americans anywhere are threatened,
we must position ourselves to protect
them, defend them, extract them, and
retaliate if they are attacked. The sec-
ond thing we should all be able to agree
on is that if Americans come under at-
tack, even if it is from a proxy force
that is directed by a foreign agent like
the IRGC, not only must we defend
against that attack, but we must pun-
ish it with swift retaliation. That
should unite us on a matter of incred-
ible importance.
I hope all of the misinformation will
stop because this matter is too impor-
tant with which to play political
games.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

HEALTHCARE
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, across
America, there are 130 million individ-
uals who have a preexisting condition.
This means individuals have a diag-
nosis, an illness, a medical condition
that without the Affordable Care Act
would likely mean they were priced out
of insurance because the costs associ-
ated with their illness are so high that
no insurer would provide them cov-
erage or the cost of insurance is much
higher than those who don’t have that
illness or that condition.
These preexisting conditions don’t
discriminate. They affect Republicans
and Democrats, liberals and conserv-
atives, people who watch FOX News,
people who watch MSNBC. This isn’t a
partisan issue; preexisting conditions
affect everybody.
In my State, give or take, 522,000 peo-
ple have preexisting conditions, and I
talk to them every time I go back to
Connecticut. I remember 2 years ago
when I was walking across the State—
something I do every year. I take about
a week in the summer, and I walk from
one end of the State to the other end—
there were families who would find out
on social media where I was going to be
walking that day and pre-position

May 16, 2019
themselves hours ahead of time by the
side of the road so they could tell me
about their diagnosis. One young
woman was sobbing on the side of the
road in Meriden, CT, as she explained
to me her lupus diagnosis and how,
without the Affordable Care Act and
the protections it provides her, she
would not have insurance; she would
not be able to afford the medications
that keep her well and alive; and her
life would be ruined. Those individuals
are freaking out today because they
have watched this President—and
frankly this Republican Congress—use
every power at their disposal, every
tool in their toolkit to try to take
away these protections for people who
are sick, for people who, through no
fault of their own, just have higher
medical bills than the rest of us. They
don’t feel like they should be discrimi-
nated against or forsaken by the health
insurance marketplace because of their
unfortunate diagnosis.
The latest assault on people with pre-
existing conditions comes through an
effort by the administration to allow
States to sell insurance plans that
don’t cover basic medical needs, plans
that would allow for a skimpy set of
benefits to be sold out on the insurance
marketplaces. Now, admittedly, that
might be good news for pretty healthy
people who don’t want to pay for a full
insurance product because they think
they don’t need it.
The first problem with that is you
are only healthy until you are not
healthy. The second bigger problem is,
when all the healthy people go to these
skimpy plans—sometimes called junk
plans—and all the people with pre-
existing conditions get left behind on
the regulated plans, where insurance is
real, where it covers everything you
need, costs go down for the healthy
people, and they go through the roof
for the sick people, which is the entire
problem we were trying to solve in 2009
and 2010. It is, in fact, the problem the
Republicans say repeatedly out on the
campaign trail and back in their dis-
tricts and States that they want to
solve too. I don’t know that I have met
a Republican Senator who doesn’t say
that they don’t think people with pre-
existing conditions should be discrimi-
nated against. Yet this rule the admin-
istration is proposing is going to allow
States to do just that. It will allow for
a ‘‘have and have not’’ insurance sys-
tem, in which people with preexisting
conditions are charged more and people
without preexisting conditions are
charged less.
My intention was to come down to
the floor today and offer a unanimous
consent request to get us on the road
to solving this latest assault on people
with preexisting conditions. Let me ex-
plain to you what my request was
going to be. I understand there are Re-
publican objections, and there is not
the ability to object today when I
make this request, so I will reserve the
right to make that request until early
next week.
Here is the substance of the request I
was planning to make today. Last
week, the House of Representatives
passed a piece of legislation called the
Protecting Americans with Preexisting
Conditions Act, and what this legisla-
tion would have done—and will do, if
passed and signed by the President—is
prevent HHS from taking any action to
implement the administration’s waiv-
ers for States to set up these junk
plans, these skimpy plans.
It is in keeping with the intent of the
Affordable Care Act, which is to allow
flexibility for States—there is an abil-
ity under the Affordable Care Act for
States to innovate and to be flexible,
but the Affordable Care Act says you
can’t do that in a way that hurts con-
sumers. You can’t do that in a way
that provides less coverage to con-
sumers.
The rule the Trump administration is
proposing, in many of our minds, is a
violation of the Affordable Care Act in
and of itself, which is still the law of
the land, but this piece of legislation
would clarify that you cannot allow for
the development and widespread sale of
these junk insurance plans without
dramatically harming the healthcare
of the 130 million Americans who have
preexisting conditions.
So my intent was to ask for a unani-
mous consent request to bring this bill
for a vote in the Senate. I will do that
next week.
At some point, we have to act like we
actually are the U.S. Senate. It is not
enough to just say over and over again
that you support people with pre-
existing conditions and then do noth-
ing as the administration launches a
daily, nonstop, unending, unceasing,
relentless effort to destroy healthcare
for people with preexisting conditions.
This is the latest assault on people
with preexisting conditions, but it
stands in a very long, ongoing line of
actions by this administration, backed
up by Republicans in the Congress, to
try to reduce coverage and increase
costs for people with preexisting condi-
tions.
It started, of course, with the whole
repeal effort, which would not have re-
placed the Affordable Care Act with
anything meaningful. The bill that
passed the House of Representatives
would have stripped healthcare away
from 30 million Americans. The tax bill
that included a portion of healthcare
repeal that was passed and signed by
the President eliminates healthcare for
13 million Americans, and many of
those have preexisting conditions.
As we speak today, the administra-
tion is readying to go to court with a
whole bunch of Republican attorneys
general to ask the Federal judicial sys-
tem to overturn protections for people
with preexisting conditions. So having
failed to get the entirety of the bill re-
pealed through the Congress, the ad-
ministration now is going to court to
try to get the protections for people
with preexisting conditions repealed.
Once again, this Congress, this Sen-
ate is silent on that case. We have of-
fered another piece of legislation to
stop that lawsuit from going forward.
We don’t have any takers on the Re-
publican side. This assault is real. I
didn’t make it up. It is not imagined. If
this court case that the Trump admin-
istration is pushing succeeds, over-
night the entirety of the Affordable
Care Act will be invalidated, and there
is no plan to replace it.
If these junk plans go into effect—lis-
ten, maybe I will be wrong. I hope I am
wrong. Maybe there will not be a flight
of people to these skimpy plans, but
much of the analyses I have seen sug-
gests that will happen. If it does, there
is just no way, other than for the cost
to go up for everybody who is left be-
hind on the regulated plans. I don’t
know about you, but when I talk to my
folks living paycheck to paycheck in
Connecticut, they don’t have a lot of
room in their budget for increased pre-
miums for healthcare. They are maxed
out as it is.
So I will stand down for now, but I
will be back early next week to offer
this unanimous consent request. I
hope, if my colleagues turn it down, if
they don’t want to bring up a piece of
legislation that would stop this latest
regulatory assault on the Affordable
Care Act, that they will come to the
table with other ideas as to how to pro-
tect people with preexisting conditions
from this campaign of sabotage by the
administration; that they will finally
recognize that this assault on the Af-
fordable Care Act in the court system
is a really awful precedent to set.
It is going to come back and bite all
of us as legislators if it is successful.
Without any real hope of a replacement
for the Affordable Care Act, it leads to
a humanitarian disaster in which 20
million to 30 million people lose insur-
ance because of it.
This is as important as it gets. There
is very little that matters to people
more than their health and their
healthcare, and I hope that possibly
next week we can come together as a
body and finally do something about
the administration’s attempt to take
away these protections for sick people
and people with complicated diagnoses
all across the country.

REMEMBERING SEYMOUR BRYSON
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, basket-
ball brought Seymour Bryson to the
Southern Illinois University at
Carbondale in 1955. He had a record-set-
ting career at the school, winning most
valuable player all 4 years, setting a
then-school record in scoring and hold-
ing the school’s record for rebounds,
which stands to this day. As remark-
able as his basketball career was, Sey-
mour went on to make his mark with
more than four decades of work mak-
ing SIU a better place.
Seymour was a three-degree alumnus
of SIU, earning a bachelor’s degree in
social work in 1959, a master’s degree
in rehabilitation counseling in 1961,
and a doctorate in educational psy-
chology in 1972. At the time, he was
one of three African Americans to
progress from assistant professor to
full professor at SIU, first African-
American associate dean of a college,
and the second of three African-Amer-
ican deans.
Generations of all ages could come to
Seymour for advice. It was that kind of
trust that earned him leadership roles
throughout the community. He was ac-
tive in a variety of roles, including
president of the Carbondale chapter of
the NAACP, member and chair of the
Diversifying Faculty Initiative, presi-
dent of the Jackson County 708 Mental
Health Board, and president and mem-
ber of the board of directors of the
Carbondale United Way.
Seymour received numerous awards
throughout his life, including the Sen-
ator Emil Jones Mentoring Award, the
Introspect Access Award, the Distin-
guished Service Award from the Illi-
nois Committee on Black Concerns in
Higher Education, and the 2019 SIU
Distinguished Alumni Award for his
humanitarian impact.
His family was never far from his
heart. He loved time with his grand-
children. They had wonderful trips to
Dairy Queen and seeing movies to-
gether. They got their love of reading
through him and their trips to book-
stores. He captured much of these mo-
ments in film as an amateur photog-
rapher.
Seymour helped define what it meant
to be a Saluki in his career and life. He
passed away on May 5, we remember
him for his service to his community.
Seymour is survived by his loving
wife of 59 years, Marjorie Bryson; son,
Todd Bryson; daughters, Robin Bryson
and Keri and her husband Stephen
Burns; grandchildren, Jordan Bryson,
Keric Young, Kendall Young, Adrian
Bryson, Francesca Sanchez, Fernando
Sanchez, and Isaiah Burns; sisters,
Susie Barnes and Janice Bryson Carol
and her husband Paul Henry of
Carbondale, and brother, Raymond and
his wife Cynthia Bryson; and a host of
nieces, nephews, and dear friends.

REMEMBERING HARVEY WELCH
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it didn’t
feel historic at the time for Harvey
Welch, but it was. Harvey, a native of
Centralia, IL, came to Southern Illi-
nois University Carbondale on a bas-
ketball scholarship and became the
first Black student at the university to
letter in basketball in 1951. He achieved
this 3 years before the Brown v. Board
ruling found school segregation uncon-
stitutional.
Harvey played basketball at SIU
from 1951 to 1954. He also was the first
Black student to complete the ROTC
program at the university. When he
finished college, he joined the U.S. Air
Force and was one of the first three
Black officers to be promoted to lieu-
tenant colonel.

May 16, 2019
Never forgetting SIU, Harvey came
back to Carbondale after he retired
from the Air Force in 1975. He became
the first Black dean of student life at
SIU and served as vice chancellor of
student affairs from 1987 to 2000.
In addition to SIU, Harvey continued
serving his community through the
Carbondale Park District, Rotary
International, and Southern Illinois
Regional Social Services. His work
earned him the Carbondale Chamber of
Commerce Citizen of the Year Award in
2007.
SIU recognized with the Distin-
guished Service Award during com-
mencement in 2018. For 22 years, stu-
dents benefited not only from his lead-
ership and wisdom, but from the Har-
vey and Trish Welch Scholarship Fund
too.
Harvey helped define what it meant
to be a Saluki. He loved hunting and
golf, but his commitment to SIU and
his family came first. Future genera-
tions of Salukis will continue to look
up to Harvey’s legacy of service and
dedication.
On May 4, Harvey passed away after
an extraordinary life of service to his
country and his community.
Harvey is survived by his four chil-
dren and their spouses: Harvey Cato
Welch and Anita, Gordon Patrick
Welch and Retha, Karen Annette Welch
Edwards and Terry, and Brian David
Welch and Petrice. He leaves behind 11
grandchildren, 3 great-grandchildren,
and numerous nieces and nephews.

f
NOMINATION HOLD
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am
placing a hold on the nomination of
David M. Satterfield, who has been
nominated to serve as Ambassador to
Turkey. My objection comes down to
one increasingly irrefutable point: the
State Department’s, through Ambas-
sador Satterfield, consistent efforts to
protect the Palestinian Authority and
Palestine Liberation Organization
from liability and thereby undermine
the rights of American victims of Pal-
estinian terrorism. This stands in
sharp contrast to the intent of Con-
gress.
Last year, I introduced the Anti-Ter-
rorism Clarification Act, ATCA, in re-
sponse to recent court decisions that
gutted the jurisdictional reach of the
Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, which I
also authored. These decisions made it
substantially more difficult for Amer-
ican victims to hold sponsors of inter-
national terrorism accountable in our
nation’s courts.
The ATCA expressed a clear prin-
ciple: If you accept taxpayer-backed
assistance or maintain a presence in
the United States, then you should be
answerable in our courts if you are al-
leged to have supported terrorism that
harmed or killed Americans.
The bipartisan bill was considered
through regular order, with markups in
both Chambers, as a standalone bill,
passed Congress without objection, and
was signed into law by President
Trump in October. Never once did the
State Department or the administra-
tion raise a single concern.
Yet, 2 months later, at the end of the
115th Congress, the State Department
began directly lobbying Congress for a
‘‘fix’’ to the ATCA to remove certain
forms of assistance from the statute,
thereby allowing defendants like the
Palestinian Authority to enjoy such
benefits without risk of liability. Am-
bassador Satterfield led the State De-
partment team, with whom my staff
attempted to negotiate in good faith
over several weeks at the end of 2018
and early this year.
I offered numerous compromise pro-
posals to the State Department, in-
cluding delays of the foreign assistance
provisions, a rule of construction to aid
victims, and even a complete strike
from the ATCA of the assistance that
State Department deems so valuable.
Never once, however, did State or Am-
bassador Satterfield demonstrate in-
terest in supporting language that
would tangibly benefit victims. Rather,
my bill seemed an annoyance to
State’s priorities, and Ambassador
Satterfield on several occasions vocal-
ized his concern about the law’s impact
on the Palestinian Authority, who
have been found liable in U.S. courts
for supporting terrorist attacks
against Americans.
When my staff asked for any alter-
native ideas they would support to help
victims, State’s team came back
empty-handed, and after I found bipar-
tisan support for a compromise pro-
posal, the State Department made
clear to other offices that it would not
support the compromise unless and
until Congress expressly protects the
Palestinian Authority’s presence in the
United States.
I refuse to assist the State Depart-
ment in silencing any litigation argu-
ments of U.S. victims of terrorism.
I also understand that recent efforts
in the House of Representatives have
proved futile in finding language that
both benefits American victims and
gets support from the State Depart-
ment. I am tired of our State Depart-
ment putting the interests of alleged
sponsors of terrorism over those of our
own citizens. The State Department
should work in good faith with Con-
gress and victims by unambiguously
demonstrating its support for restoring
jurisdiction over sponsors of terrorism.
f
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for
over 50 years, our Nation has preserved
an annual tradition of honoring the
brave men and women of law enforce-
ment who make the ultimate sacrifice.
This act of remembrance dates back to
President John F. Kennedy’s designa-
tion of a ‘‘Peace Officers Memorial
Day’’ in 1962, which has evolved over
the years to become National Police
Week. Police Week now includes a
weeklong celebration of our law en-
forcement officers and recognition for
their sacrifices.
Tens of thousands from the law en-
forcement community have descended
upon Washington this week, as they
gather near the National Law Enforce-
ment Memorial to remember their col-
leagues and their families. The memo-
rial was dedicated in 1991 to honor our
local, State, and Federal law enforce-
ment officers killed in the line of duty.
The long gray walls are curved in a
way that makes them appear to go on
forever. Over 21,000 names are perma-
nently inscribed into the marble walls
as a reminder of the cost of maintain-
ing a free, safe, and civil society.
On Wednesday, the 38th Annual Na-
tional Peace Officers’ Memorial Serv-
ice was held right outside on the West
Front of the Capitol. During this sol-
emn ceremony, the names of 228 brave
men and women were read in honor of
their priceless contribution to their
fellow citizens.
Among those being remembered this
week are six from my home State of
South Carolina. Sergeant Terrence
Carraway of the Florence Police De-
partment, Detective Micheal Doty of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2918 May 16, 2019
the York County Sheriff’s Office, Cor-
poral Dale Hallman of the Saluda
County Sheriff’s Office, Deputy James
Kirk, Jr., of the Lancaster County
Sheriff’s Office, Deputy Farrah Turner
of the Florence County Sheriff’s Office,
and Deputy Jerry Hurd, Jr., of the
Richland County Sheriff’s Office will
all be memorialized on those stone
walls. Their names will be a perpetual
reminder to future generations of the
high cost of keeping South Carolinians
safe. We honor them, their families,
and all of the other brave men and
women who died while protecting our
communities.
While every officer deserves to have
their story heard, I would like to call
attention to Sergeant Carraway and
Deputy Turner. On October 3, 2018,
Florence County law enforcement exe-
cuted a warrant on an individual ac-
cused of sexual assault on a child. As
they arrived on scene, the officers were
ambushed by the suspect’s father.
When the officers got out of their vehi-
cles, the father started shooting at
them. The standoff and the shooting
continued for 2 long hours. Despite the
danger, the officers did not retreat, but
continued to fight. After all was said
and done, a total of seven law enforce-
ment personnel had been shot. Sadly,
both Sergeant Carraway and Deputy
Turner were mortally wounded.
I was fortunate enough to attend Ser-
geant Carraway’s memorial service in
Florence. It was a beautiful tribute to
a life of service. This man was a deco-
rated police officer, Air Force Reserv-
ist, coach, mentor, loving husband, fa-
ther, and friend. Like many of those we
are remembering this week, the
Terrance Carraway’s of the world are
the foundation of America’s goodness.
This is but one small example of how
our law enforcement officers put them-
selves in harm’s way for the better-
ment of the community on a daily
basis. These officers answered a call to
take a suspect off the street, and it
cost them their lives. It is our duty to
honor and remember their contribution
and their sacrifice.
Earlier this week I introduced a reso-
lution to commemorate National Po-
lice Week. Included are the names of
159 brave men and women who an-
swered the call of duty, but were sadly
taken from us in 2018. This resolution
has unanimous, bipartisan support and
honors those who have given their lives
in fulfilling this noble calling. I want
to thank my 99 Senate colleagues who
signed on as cosponsors of this meas-
ure.
In trying to grasp the essence of Na-
tional Police Week, I think President
George H. W. Bush summed it up best.
During the groundbreaking ceremony
for the National Law Enforcement Me-
morial in 1989, President Bush said,
‘‘The story to be carved on these walls
is the story of America, of a continuing
quest to preserve both democracy and
decency and to protect a national
treasure that we call the American
dream.’’ I am proud to echo his words
today and, along with my colleagues,
ensure the story of our heroes is told. I
encourage all Americans to take a mo-
ment this week to reflect on how law
enforcement positively affects their
own community. These officers show
up every day on behalf of their fellow
citizens to serve and protect the Amer-
ican dream that President Bush spoke
of nearly 30 years ago. Join me in re-
membering the fallen, and let us ensure
their sacrifice is never forgotten.
f
NATIONAL PREVENTION WEEK
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the
misuse of opioids is a national crisis.
Every single day, more than 130 people
in this country overdose on these
drugs, with tragic results.
In 2017, there were more than 70,000
drug overdose-related deaths in the
United States, according to the Centers
for Disease Control. These deaths
eclipsed the number that were due to
guns or automobile crashes.
May 12 through 18 is National Pre-
vention Week, which is dedicated to in-
creasing public awareness of substance
abuse disorders. Addiction exists every-
where. We have taken steps in the past
to fight this epidemic.
We passed comprehensive substance
abuse and treatment legislation in 2016
and again last year. However, the
opioid epidemic continues to destroy
lives and communities. We need to re-
main committed to defeat this crisis.
This week also marks the seventh an-
niversary of my investigation, with
former Senator Baucus, into opioid
manufacturers’ connections to medical
groups and physicians who advocated
for the increased use of opioids. As sen-
ior members of the Senate Finance
Committee in 2012, we sought docu-
ments and financial information from
three opioid makers, in a period when
deaths from opioid overdoses were sky-
rocketing. News reports of that time
suggested that opioid makers may have
initiated conflicts of interest to en-
courage the prescribing of opioids.
More recent news reports confirm
that we had very good reason to launch
this oversight work. For example, yes-
terday, BBC News published an article
concerning opioid makers’ sponsorship,
in the early 2000s, of so-called edu-
cational meetings for pain specialists
from the United Kingdom. The doctors,
whose opioid prescribing rates were
being monitored by opioid makers,
were invited to New York City, where
they would stay in posh hotels and at-
tend Broadway shows at a drugmaker’s
expense, BBC reported. As reportedly
shared by a doctor who attended one of
these trips: ‘‘I feel very ashamed . . . I
was just a guinea pig to promote the
prescribing of a class of drug.’’
I remain concerned that opioid-re-
lated deaths over the last decade may
have been fueled by misinformation
and marketing practices embraced by
drugmakers and the medical organiza-
tions to which they donated.
What I said 7 years ago remains true
today: ‘‘Doctors and patients should
know if the medical literature and
groups that guide [opioids’] use are
paid for by the drugs’ manufacturers
and if so, [by] how much.’’ As chairman
of the Senate Finance Committee, I in-
tend to continue my oversight work in
this area, including by convening a
congressional hearing later this sum-
mer.
I also believe that we need to do
more to ensure that Americans have
access to effective recovery treatment
options. The recent arrests in multiple
States of those who operated sham
treatment facilities for addicts point
to a problem. Moreover, we have reason
to be concerned about the lack of infor-
mation available to the public about
the most promising treatment options
available.
A related issue has been the lack of
adequate, national standards of care in
the addiction treatment field. That is
why I joined several of my colleagues
in sponsoring bipartisan legislation
that calls for the development of new
quality measures to improve treatment
for Americans battling opioid and sub-
stance addiction. This measure directs
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services to work with a coalition of
healthcare providers to identify qual-
ity measures to be used to assess the
effectiveness of substance use disorder
treatment programs.
In 2016, I also supported the Com-
prehensive Addiction and Recovery
Act, or CARA. This bipartisan measure
was enacted after the Senate Judiciary
Committee approved it during my ten-
ure as chairman. It includes a number
of provisions I authored.
The causes of the opioid epidemic are
complicated and its effects are wide-
spread. It is impossible to solve this
national crisis overnight. We must con-
tinue our efforts at the local, State,
and Federal level to break the cycle of
addiction.

54TH ANNIVERSARY OF HEAD

Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President,
today I wish to pay tribute to the
countless men and women in Alaska
and across the Nation who have dedi-
cated their talents to ensuring that
young children and their parents have
the tools they need to succeed. I speak
of all those involved in their local Head
Start and Early Head Start programs,
the program directors, teachers, aides,
and parent leaders.
This week marks the 54th anniver-
sary of Head Start and the 25th anni-
versary of Early Head Start. Since 1964,
more than 36 million children have par-
ticipated in Head Start, a program that
research has shown reduces intergen-
erational poverty by helping parents to
gain parenting, work, and leadership
skills and which gives young children
at risk the academic, health, and nutri-
tional services they need to build a
foundation for success.

numeracy, cognitive, and behavioral
skills than they otherwise would have
had. They are more likely to graduate
and complete college. They are more
likely to live healthy, productive lives
as adults. Today, Head Start alumni
are strong, resilient individuals who
make positive contributions to their
communities as doctors, nurses, ath-
letes, parents, entrepreneurs, teachers,
police officers, CEOs, authors, artists,
and more.
Head Start and Early Head Start are
more important now than they ever
have been, helping families across the
country so tragically hurt by the
opioid crisis. Head Start and Early
Head Start directors, teachers, aides,
and parent leaders are on the
frontlines, helping our most at-risk
children survive and thrive in the face
of the adverse childhood experiences
caused by homelessness, neglect, and
abuse. They are there in times of nat-
ural disaster, community violence, and
personal crisis. They are helping par-
ents and grandparents provide stable
and nurturing environments. In Native
communities, they are helping to revi-
talize languages and strengthen tradi-
tional ways of knowing and living. Our
communities and the Nation as a whole
are stronger because Head Start and
Early Head Start programs help mil-
lions of families find their way to
strength and resilience.
Head Start staff in Alaska and across
the country are dedicated, innovative,
caring, and motivated people who work
hard each and every day to ensure that
the children and families they serve
have the tools they need to achieve
their full potential. Beyond the volu-
minous research showing the positive
impact of these programs, I know what
they do makes a lasting difference.
When I visit elementary schools across
my State, principals tell me that the
students who have participated in Head
Start are better prepared in every way
for school.
So I take this opportunity to wish
every Head Start and Early Head Start
staff member and participant. Happy
anniversary. As a longtime supporter, I
recommit to doing all I can to ensure
that our Head Start and Early Head
Start programs continue to make a
positive difference for many more
years to come.

REMEMBERING RICHARD LUGAR
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish
to honor our former colleague Senator
Richard Lugar, who passed away re-
cently and whose memorial service was
this week. As the longest serving Sen-
ator from his beloved Indiana, Richard
Lugar dedicated 36 years of service to
his State, the Senate, and our Nation.
He was a dear friend and mentor who
already had 22 years of Senate service
when I joined the Senate.
What I remember most fondly about
Senator Lugar is that he combined an
extraordinary intellect with good
humor. He knew so much about foreign
policy and was also so approachable
that new Senators like myself never
hesitated to seek his guidance.
Senator Lugar’s commitment to bi-
partisanship guided his engagement on
issues from international affairs to ag-
riculture. He sought compromises to
achieve results, regardless of the polit-
ical calculus. He eschewed polarization
and cautioned colleagues that, ‘‘what-
ever is won today through division is
usually lost tomorrow.’’ Instead he
sought to foster good will to bring to-
gether opposing sides. He continued
this effort after his service in the Sen-
ate with the Lugar Center, a nonprofit
public policy institution that seeks to
improve the quality of debate and
bridge ideological divides on important
issues.
It is this approach that led to great
success in international affairs from
South Africa to the Philippines.
Senator Lugar viewed support for de-
mocracy and development as a stabi-
lizing force to counter international
threats. Around the world, partners
trusted his foreign policy expertise and
judgment. Perhaps his greatest
achievement was his bipartisan work
with Senator Sam Nunn in developing
the Cooperative Threat Reduction Pro-
gram to dismantle weapons of mass de-
struction in the former states of the
Soviet Union, eliminating nuclear
arms in Ukraine, Belarus, and
Kazakhstan. His work to limit weapons
of mass destruction led to the deactiva-
tion and destruction of thousands of
nuclear warheads and ballistic mis-
siles. Due to Senator Lugar’ s vision,
leadership, and bipartisan approach, we
live in a safer world.
Through his contributions to inter-
national security, Senator Lugar
serves as a reminder of what we can
achieve if we work together to face the
challenges that pose dangers to world
peace and stability and, of course, to
the interests of the United States and
our international partners. As we re-
flect on his life and his lessons, I hope
my colleagues will honor his legacy by
building bipartisan bridges to resolve
the pressing problems of today.

TRIBUTE TO MASTER SERGEANT
JESSE EDINGER
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
Jesse Edinger of Fort Harrison, MT, for
his impact on the Lewis and Clark
County and surrounding areas.
Jesse Edinger joined the U.S. Army
directly after graduating high school in
1999. He attended basic and advanced
individual training at Fort Leonard
Wood, MO. His first duty station was in
Fort Drum, NY, where he served as a
military police Patrolman, MP. Short-
ly after, he received orders to go to
Korea. There he was immediately as-
signed to the United Nations Command
Honor Guard, providing a variety of
missions. In Korea, he met the love of
his life Sunwoo. They married and
transferred to Fort Riley, KS, in 2003.
Immediately after arriving Fort Riley,
Jesse received orders to deploy to Iraq.
In Iraq, he completed a wide range of
military police battlefield functions
and was able to return safely to the
U.S. In 2004, Jesse left Active Duty and
decided to serve his home State in the
Montana Army National Guard.
After 3 years in the Guard, he was
once again called back to Iraq as an
MP. He spent a year there and again
returned safely to his family. In 2006,
he volunteered for the Montana Army
National Guard honor guard team and 1
year later was hired as the non-com-
missioned officer in charge of the mili-
tary funeral honors team. He worked
hand in hand with the State coordi-
nator to ensure fallen veterans re-
ceived the most professional honors
possible. He was one of Montana’s first
nationally certified honor guard in-
structors. In 2014, Jesse Edinger once
again volunteered to deploy to Afghan-
istan as a military police investigator.
After serving another yearlong deploy-
ment, he returned to his military fu-
neral honors position at Fort Harrison,
MT, where he became a certified in-
structor as a casualty notification offi-
cer. These officers notify next of kin
and assist family members of a soldier
killed in action or that has died in the
line of duty. Jesse was recently pro-
moted to the rank of master sergeant
and has conducted around 1100 funeral
honors missions for Montana veterans
and soldiers killed in action.
For 20 years, MSG Jesse Edinger has
served his country proudly and has
honored the lives of more than 1,000
Montana veterans. His wife Sun also
serves in the Montana Army National
Guard. Together they have three chil-

10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END
OF THE SRI LANKAN WAR
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, May
18 marks the 10th anniversary of the
end of the civil war in Sri Lanka. In
May 2009, the war between the govern-
ment and the separatist Liberation Ti-
gers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE, ended. The
civil war was a 27-year-long assault on
the coexistence of the Sri Lankan peo-
ple, leaving scars that remain today.
Both the Sri Lankan state and the
LTTE targeted dissidents and members
of other ethnic communities, indis-
criminately bombing places of worship,
hospitals, and public transport. On this
10th anniversary, I urge the people of
Sri Lanka to renew their commitment
to peace, reconciliation, and account-
ability for human rights violations and
crimes committed during the conflict.
In the wake of the devastating ter-
rorist attacks last month, the inter-
national community should also renew
its commitment to supporting those
Sri Lankan citizens committed to a
peaceful and democratic society where
the rights of all are protected under
the law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2920 May 16, 2019
The final years of the war saw
heightened intensity of fighting and
soaring human rights abuses, including
hundreds of enforced disappearances,
extrajudicial killings of aid workers,
arbitrary arrests, torture, and the use
of child soldiers. The government la-
beled any reporters critical of the gov-
ernment’s war against the LTTE as
‘‘traitors’’ and ‘‘terrorists,’’ and the
LTTE tolerated no dissent in areas it
controlled. The last few months of
fighting resulted in the deaths of as
many as 40,000 civilians in the final as-
sault against the LTTE. Victims’
groups say the fates of more than
100,000 people remain unknown. UN sat-
ellite images showed that the govern-
ment repeatedly and indiscriminately
shelled no fire zones, where it had en-
couraged civilians to concentrate, and
where estimates show that as many as
330,000 civilians were trapped. UN in-
vestigations determined that ‘‘gross
violations’’ of international rights law
occurred on all sides of the conflict, in-
cluding the thousands of civilian
deaths in the military assault that
ended the rebellion. Many deaths and
tens of thousands of disappearances re-
main unaddressed.
For many Sri Lankans, the terrorist
attacks last Easter Sunday, evoked
emotions reminiscent of war times. I
express my deepest condolences to the
families who lost loved ones and de-
nounce in the strongest terms this vile
attack on the Sri Lankan people. As
families recovered bodies of loved ones
and buried and cremated them, they
felt a pain that is sadly too familiar to
so many Sri Lankans. While the per-
petrators of the Easter Sunday attacks
sought to sow hatred between commu-
nities and bring chaos to Sri Lanka,
the government bears the responsi-
bility to respond swiftly to retaliatory
attacks against Muslim communities
and ensure communal harmony and na-
tional unity. To be Sri Lankan is to be
Buddhist, to be Hindu, to be Muslim,
and to be Christian. All these commu-
nities have the right to exercise their
religious identity and to live in peace
and security in Sri Lanka.
On January 9, 2015, the Sri Lankan
people voted to unseat President
Mahinda Rajapaksa. A few months
later, the government of Maithripala
Sirisena cosponsored United Nations
Human Rights Council, UNHRC, reso-
lution 30/1 on ‘‘Promoting reconcili-
ation, accountability and human rights
in Sri Lanka,’’ ushering in what ap-
peared to be a new era dedicated to jus-
tice and reconciliation. This enthu-
siasm and hope has unfortunately
faded over the years. In 2017, Sri Lanka
received a 2-year extension to imple-
ment the commitments in the resolu-
tion. This past March, the UNHRC
adopted a new resolution again cospon-
sored by the government of Sri Lanka,
extending the timeline to implement
outstanding promises another 2 years.
Resolution 30/1 contains 36 actionable
commitments. The Sri Lankan Govern-
ment has fulfilled only six over a pe-
riod of 4 years. These include recent de-
cisions to criminalize enforced dis-
appearances, create an office on miss-
ing persons, and appointing commis-
sioners to the office for reparations.
Why did these few steps require 4 years
of time?
Despite the long list of promises,
there has been little to no progress in
establishing a commission for truth,
justice, reconciliation, and nonrecur-
rence. Despite commitments made by
the government, Sri Lanka has not
adopted constitutional reforms that
would address the long held grievances
of communities across the country.
The government has failed to strength-
en the victim and witness protection
law. Security sector reforms, including
repealing and replacing the Prevention
of Terrorism Act, have not taken place.
The lack of accountability with respect
to war crimes suspects remains a seri-
ous concern. Limited legal action has
been taken to prosecute and hold al-
leged perpetrators to account. There is
a lack of trust and confidence in do-
mestic structures, so I echo the UN
Human Rights Commissioner’s calls
that the international community use
the principle of universal jurisdiction
to hold accountable those who face al-
legations of serious human rights vio-
lations.
Sri Lankan people deserve justice,
peace, and protections. The country
cannot move forward, rebuild, and
prosper without a timebound plan for
the government to fully implement its
HRC commitments. Accountability,
transitional justice, and reconciliation
are hard, but left unresolved, these
issues fester over time and could lead
to renewed instability. Clearly, such an
outcome should be avoided as it bene-
fits no one in or outside of Sri Lanka.
The war in Sri Lanka was a terrible
episode in a country with a proud past.
How Sri Lanka finally decides to deal
with the legacy of the conflict is criti-
cally important for its future. My hope
is that the government of Sri Lanka
delivers on all its stated commitments,
and that the international community
maintains its focus on these postwar
promises. As the country contends
with the impact of reprehensible vio-
lence last month, it must renew its
focus on the fundamentals of an inclu-
sive multireligious and multi-ethnic
society. I call on the friends of Sri
Lanka around the world to support
true reconciliation and healing as
those constructive elements of society
work hard to chart a positive future for
all of the country’s people.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
REMEMBERING BILL WILLIAMS
∑ Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I
wish to pay tribute to Bill Williams of
Saxman, AK, a businessman, commu-
nity leader, an Alaska statesman, and
my friend, who died on Sunday, May 12,
just short of his 76th birthday.
Bill’s story exemplifies how far one
can go in Alaska if one works hard and
exhibits a devotion for community
service. Bill was lifelong Alaskan and a
graduate of Ketchikan High School. He
was a longshoreman, a proud member
of the International Longshoremen and
Warehousemen’s Union. He was a busi-
ness leader, serving as president of the
Cape Fox Corporation, his ANCSA vil-
lage corporation. He was a fisherman.
He served on the Saxman City Council
and was mayor of Saxman. Bill was a
leader in the Alaska Native Brother-
hood and Tlingit and Haida.
In 1993, Bill was elected to the Alaska
House of Representatives, serving until
2004. A strong advocate for develop-
ment of Alaska’s natural resources and
preservation of the traditional subsist-
ence way of life, Bill distinguished
himself in the Alaska Legislature. He
rose to cochair the finance committee
of the Alaska House of Representa-
tives, one of the most powerful posi-
tions in the State of Alaska. Bill knew
how to make deals, and because his
word was his bond, he knew how to
keep a deal. I proudly served alongside
Bill throughout my tenure in the Alas-
ka Legislature. He was both a friend
and a mentor to me.
Tributes are pouring in from those
who knew and loved Bill Williams.
State Senator Bert Stedman, who is
cochair of the senate finance com-
mittee in the current legislative ses-
sion, had this to say about Bill: ‘‘He
understood that political differences
don’t need to divide Alaskans. In the
Capitol, he was known for keeping his
words and putting Alaska’s interests
above politics. He took the lead on
both subsistence and development
issues. He was known for working with
our federal delegation and governors to
keep jobs in the Tongass. He was a
strong voice on Alaska Native issues.’’
The Ketchikan Daily News, in an edi-
torial, remembered Bill as an honor-
able man who represented the commu-
nity and the region with quiet, stead-
fast dignity: ‘‘Those who met Williams
would not likely forget him. He was
quiet and humble, possessing eyes of
both twinkling good humor and the
glint of iron resolve. Others in public
life learned quickly not to underesti-
mate the good representative from
Saxman.’’
Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy has
also reflected on the loss of Bill Wil-
liams this week. Governor Dunleavy
said, ‘‘Real leaders do not come along
very often, so it is especially tough
when we lose one with the ability and
character of Bill Williams. He worked
both hard and smart for the constitu-
ents and communities he represented.’’
Governor Dunleavy has ordered flags to
be lowered to half-staff this week in
Bill’s memory.
From the central council of Tlingit
and Haida Tribes, ‘‘Gunalcheesh,
Haw’aa to Bill for his lifelong dedica-
tion to Southeast Alaska and its peo-
ple.’’

recognize Peter Petrasko, an intern in
my Washington, DC, office, for all the
hard work he has done on behalf of my-
self, my staff, and the State of South
Dakota.
Peter is a graduate of O’Gorman High

REMEMBERING STAN FURMAN
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor the life and legacy of the
Honorable Stan Furman, a former Ari-
zona State senator and community
leader who passed away in Phoenix,
AZ, on April 1, 2019, at the age of 87.
Having spent his formative years in the
Vista Del Mar Orphanage in Los Ange-
les, Stan developed a strong sense of
family. While in the orphanage, Stan
worked any job he could, and caddying
at the Hillcrest Country Club gave him
some great stories about George Burns,
Milton Berle, Jack Benny and others.
Stan served his country honorably in
the U.S. Air Force from 1952 until l956
and was stationed in Japan during the
Korean war. After his service, he
moved to Mexico City, where he earned
a degree in business and foreign trade
from Mexico City College. There, he
met his soulmate and wife of 58 years,
Gloria. They married in Mexico City in
1960. The couple moved to California,
where Stan worked for a fabric whole-
saler, and they raised three children:
Diane, Philip, and Susan.
The family moved to Phoenix in 1969,
where Stan opened and managed a new
branch of the business. After their chil-
dren left the nest, Stan and Gloria
started a successful translation busi-
ness, allowing them to travel to Mex-
ico, China, Italy, Spain, and many
other international destinations. Stan
loved Arizona and wanted to serve his
community, so he ran for the State
senate in 1990. He served in the Arizona
State Senate from l991 to 1995. After he
retired from elected office, he contin-
ued to serve on many boards and com-
missions and worked for the Arizona
Corporation Commission.
In 1998, Stan was named Mediator of
the Year by the Phoenix Community
Mediation Program. Long active in the
Arizona Civil Liberties Union, Stan
served as Arizona ACLU president from
2002 to 2006 and was honored to be
named Arizona Civil Libertarian of the
Year in 1995. He also served for several
years on the National ACLU board of
directors. Stan was an avid tennis
player and golfer, quick-witted, and a
natural joke teller. He loved crossword
puzzles, Boggle, and all word games. He
immensely enjoyed playing board
games and online games with his chil-
dren and grandchildren. He loved going
to the beach while enjoying time at the
family’s vacation home in Rocky
Point, Mexico.
Stan is survived by his loving wife,
Gloria, daughters Diane (Randy) and
Susan, son Phil (Deb), grandsons Spen-
cer, Dylan, Nate, Harrison, Alex
(Jessi), Hugo and Oscar, and great-
granddaughter Cheyanne. He will be
dearly missed by other family mem-
bers, friends, and the hundreds of peo-
ple whose lives she touched. Please join
me in honoring his memory.∑

REMEMBERING GERALDINE
‘‘JERRY’’ EMMETT
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor the life and legacy of
Geraldine ‘‘Jerry’’ Emmett, a commu-
nity leader who passed away in Pres-
cott, AZ, on April 30, 2019, at the age of
104. Jerry was a lifelong Democrat and
campaigned for Arizona’s first Gov-
ernor, George W.P. Hunt, before she
was old enough to vote. She will be
fondly remembered as the oldest dele-
gate at the 2016 Democratic National
Convention, where she did several na-
tional media interviews.
While waiting tables in her family’s
restaurant, she met and impressed an
Arizona State Teachers College—now
Northern Arizona University—re-
cruiter from Flagstaff, and received a
tuition scholarship of $14.00 per semes-
ter, allowing her to attend and grad-
uate from ASTC in 1937 with a degree
in elementary education. She began
her 40-year teaching career at Kayenta
on the Navajo Reservation. She also
taught in Seligman, Tombstone, and
Scottsdale, before finally settling in
Phoenix at the Creighton School Dis-
trict. She taught in Phoenix for the
next 30 years until her retirement, pri-
marily at Lafayette Elementary
School, Larry C. Kennedy. Evidently,
her teaching career made an impres-
sion on her students, as over 60 former
students attended her 100th birthday
party to pay homage.
Jerry cofounded the Prescott Area
Democratic Women’s Club and was a
regular sight at Democratic Party
events with her friends Carolyn and
Dawn. Her smile and stories of growing
up in Depression-era Arizona will be
missed.
Jerry is survived by her youngest
son, Jim Emmett, five grandchildren,
and five great-grandchildren. She will
be dearly missed by other family mem-
bers, friends, and the hundreds of peo-
ple whose lives she touched. Please join
me in honoring her memory.∑

Jonathan is a graduate of Stevens

TRIBUTE TO F. ANTHONY
CLIFFORD
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
am honored to recognize one of my
constituents, F. Anthony ‘‘Tony’’
Clifford, who is retiring on June 22,
2019, after 50 years of Federal service as
an engineer at the National Institutes
of Health.
Tony has dedicated his career to
helping advance NIH’s mission: seeking
fundamental knowledge about the na-
ture of living systems and applying
that knowledge to advance the health
of all people. He has done this by work-
ing to ensure that NIH’s buildings and
facilities create a world-class environ-
ment for conducting biomedical re-
search.
Throughout his service as an engi-
neer with NIH, Tony has been com-
mitted to creating state-of-the-art re-
search facilities. In 1969, he started his
work as an NIH staff engineer. Begin-
ning in 1992, he led the NIH facility
program as director of engineering
services until becoming chief engineer
in the Office of the Director in 2003.
Tony holds a bachelors of mechanical
engineering degree from the University
of Maryland at College Park, which
presented him in 2016 with the Golden
Terp Award from the University’s
Clark School of Engineering for his 50
years of engineering practice. His nu-
merous other awards include multiple
NIH Directors and Merit Awards, the
Federal Energy Award, Vice President
Gore’s Hammer Award, and Special
Recognition by the Society of Amer-
ican Military Engineers.
In addition to his work in the field,
Tony was instrumental in recruiting
engineering interns by representing
NIH at career fairs and STEM events.
In this way, his impact on scientific
discovery will last for years to come,
as he has inspired young scientists to

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petition or memorial
was laid before the Senate and was re-
ferred or ordered to lie on the table as
indicated:
POM–60. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana
urging the United States Congress to take
such actions as are necessary to review and
consider eliminating provisions of federal
law which reduce Social Security benefits
for those receiving pension benefits from cer-
tain federal, state, or local government re-
tirement or pension systems, plans, or funds;
to the Committee on Finance.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 20
Whereas, the Congress of the United States
of America has enacted both the Government
Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal
and survivor Social Security benefit, and the
Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), re-
ducing the earned Social Security benefits
payable to any person who also receives a
public pension benefit; and
Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a
spouse or survivor receiving a federal, state,
or local government retirement or pension
benefit who would also be entitled to a So-
cial Security benefit earned by a spouse; and
Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the
spousal or survivor Social Security benefit
by two-thirds of the amount of the federal,
state, or local government retirement or
pension benefit received by the spouse or
survivor, in many cases completely elimi-
nating the Social Security benefit even
though their spouses paid Social Security
taxes for many years; and
Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on
hundreds of thousands of citizens and under-
mines the original purpose of the Social Se-
curity dependent/survivor benefit; and
Whereas, according to recent Social Secu-
rity Administration figures, more than half
a million individuals nationally are affected
by the GPO; and
Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons
who have earned federal, state, or local gov-
ernment retirement or pension benefits, in
addition to working in employment covered
under Social Security and paying into the
Social Security system; and
Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned So-
cial Security benefit using an averaged in-
dexed monthly earnings formula and may re-
duce Social Security benefits for affected
persons by as much as one-half of the retire-
ment benefit earned as a public servant in
employment not covered under Social Secu-
rity; and
Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking in-
dividuals to lose a significant portion of the
Social Security benefits that they earn
themselves; and
Whereas, according to recent Social Secu-
rity Administration figures, more than one
and a half million individuals nationally are
affected by the WEP; and
Whereas, in certain circumstances both the
WEP and GPO can be applied to a qualifying
survivor’s benefit, each independently reduc-
ing the available benefit and in combination
eliminating a large portion of the total So-
cial Security benefit available to the sur-
vivor; and
Whereas, because of the calculation char-
acteristics of the GPO and the WEP, they
have a disproportionately negative effect on
employees working in lower-wage govern-
ment jobs, like policemen, firefighters,
teachers, and state employees; and
Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort
to improve the quality of life of its citizens
and to encourage them to live here lifelong,
yet the current GPO and WEP provisions
compromise their quality of life; and
Whereas, the number of people affected by
GPO and WEP is growing every day as more
and more people reach retirement age; and
Whereas, individuals drastically affected
by the GPO or WEP may have no choice but
to return to work after retirement in order
to make ends meet, but the earnings accu-
mulated during this return to work can fur-
ther reduce the Social Security benefits the
individual is entitled to; and
Whereas, the GPO and WEP are established
in federal law, and repeal of the GPO and the
WEP can only be enacted by congress: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana
does hereby memorialize the United States
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to review the Government Pension
Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provi-
sion Social Security benefit reductions and
to consider eliminating or reducing them;
and be it further
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be
transmitted to the presiding officers of the
Senate and the House of Representatives of
the Congress of the United States of America
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2928 May 16, 2019
as part of an infrastructure invest-
ment; to the Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. the U.S.
infrastructure system is in critical
need of an upgrade. The American So-
ciety of Civil Engineers recently grad-
ed the U.S. system a D+ given its ca-
pacity, condition, funding, future need,
operation and maintenance, public
safety, resilience and innovation. Any
investment to improve our country’s
infrastructure system would create
millions of new jobs, requiring millions
of skilled workers to fill them.
A recent study by the Center of Edu-
cation and the Workforce at George-
town University estimated that a $1
trillion infrastructure investment
would create 11 million new jobs. Near-
ly half of these would require training
past the high school level. Even with-
out a significant investment, though,
infrastructure industries are already
struggling to meet workforce demands.
Workers in infrastructure industries
are expected to retire at a 50% higher
rate than the general workforce. To en-
sure infrastructure investments benefit
businesses, workers and the economy,
the U.S. must invest in the creation of
a diverse pipeline of workers with
skills necessary to access in-demand
opportunities.
Industry and sector partnerships are
a proven strategy for helping workers
prepare for middle-skill jobs and help-
ing businesses find skilled workers.
Congress requires States and local
areas to support the development of
these partnerships under the Workforce
Innovation and Opportunity Act
(WIOA), but no dedicated funding has
been provided for these activities. Ac-
cording to a recent national poll, 77%
of business leaders say it would help
their business to create closer links be-
tween education providers and busi-
nesses to train people for the jobs for
which businesses are hiring.
For workers, especially those under-
represented in infrastructure indus-
tries, support services like career coun-
seling, child care, and transportation
can often be the key to succeed in
work-based learning programs. Pro-
viding these services may be outside
the capacity of a business. Industry
partnerships bring business together
with community and human service or-
ganizations that can make these con-
nections for workers and drastically
improve their ability to succeed in
training and meet business demand for
skilled workers.
This is why I am pleased to introduce
with my colleague, Senator PORTMAN,
the Building U.S. Infrastructure by
Leveraging Demands for Skills Act or
BUILDS Act. The BUILDS Act creates
a grant program that would support in-
dustry and sector partnerships working
with local businesses, industry associa-
tions and organizations, labor organi-
zations, State and local workforce
boards, economic development agencies
and other partners engaged in their
communities to encourage industry
growth, competitiveness and collabora-
tion to improve worker training, reten-
tion and advancement in targeted in-
frastructure clusters. Additionally,
businesses and education providers
would be connected to develop class-
room curriculum to complement on-
the-job learning and workers would re-
ceive support services such as men-
toring and career counseling to ensure
that they are successful from the pre-
employment to placement in a full-
time position.
Our Nation desperately needs im-
provements to critical infrastructure
like our roads and bridges, however to
do that work we must have a trained
workforce that’s ready to fill these
good-paying jobs. Virginia businesses
in the transportation, maritime, and
information technology industries con-
tinue to tell me they have trouble find-
ing job applicants with the necessary
skills. This bill will help workers get
the job training they need to be hired.
I hope that my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle consider the BUILDS Act
as a necessary component to any in-
vestment in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture.

Whereas August 26, 2020, marks the centen-
nial of the 19th Amendment becoming a part
of the Constitution of the United States, pro-
viding for women’s suffrage; and
Whereas the centennial anniversary of the
ratification of the 19th Amendment rep-

and celebrated: Now, therefore, be it

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DR.
DAVID A. HAMBURG
HON. NANCY PELOSI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the extraordinary life and enduring
legacy of a giant of humanitarianism and a
leader of conscience, who made lasting, life-
saving contributions to the cause of eradi-
cating violent conflict and eliminating human
suffering: Dr. David Alan Hamburg.
Trained as a physician and psychiatrist, Dr.
Hamburg led a career of incredible scope and
immense impact, beginning with sweeping
contributions made to the field of medicine
from distinguished posts at hospitals, univer-
sities, research laboratories, and scientific and
public policy organizations. ‘‘Ounce of preven-
tion, ton of cure’’ was his favorite motto, and
would guide him through all his work, from dis-
ease prevention to conflict resolution.
Dr. Hamburg followed his pioneering schol-
arship on disease prevention with studies of
human behavior, specializing in the evolution
of human violence. As a recognized authority
on the study of aggression, stress and conflict,
he revolutionized the worlds’ conception of
civil conflict and warfare, led by his deep faith
in the need to ‘‘mobilize human ingenuity’’ for
peace. Much of his game-changing research
was conducted alongside his beloved wife, the
trailblazing and renowned Dr. Beatrix Ham-
burg.
At the helm of the prestigious Carnegie Cor-
poration for fifteen years, Dr. Hamburg would
use his belief in the power of prevention to
create prosperity, as he launched initiatives for
the advancement of civilization of a startling
scale, from early childhood education to youth
health to conflict resolution. He was a powerful
and early force for the study of terrorism, vio-
lence and genocide, warning that for too long,
scholars had treated these global priorities as
‘‘almost a nonsubject.’’
His leadership was critical in conflict preven-
tion and mitigation efforts, including through
initiatives such as the Carnegie Commission
on Preventing Deadly Conflict, co-chaired with
former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance,
which studied ethnic and regional conflicts in
Africa and the Balkans, and which was cited
as one of the United Nation’s ‘‘major reference
points’’ for peace efforts by Secretary-General
Ban Ki-Moon.
He was a respected voice among our col-
leagues in the Congress on nuclear non-
proliferation, which is a pillar of America’s na-
tional security. His work to develop and pass
the vital Nunn-Lugar. Amendment has helped
keep America and our allies strong and safe.
I had the privilege of learning from Dr. Ham-
burg when we served on the Board of the
Leakey Foundation for the Study of Human
Origins. Once again he would demonstrate his
leadership when he courageously obtained the
release of the Stanford students who were kid-
napped while doing primate research at
Gombe National Park, Tanzania.
Dr. Hamburg often said that he ‘‘grew up in
the shadow of the Holocaust,’’ and was moti-
vated in his work by his grandfather’s experi-
ence fleeing anti-Semitic pogroms in Latvia
and later bringing an estimated 50 relatives to
America to escape the Nazi regime. This
‘‘firsthand knowledge [on] how brutal people
could be’’ would be a powerful beacon for him,
as he sought to bring resolution, cooperation
and healing to the world. His enduring con-
tributions to turn that painful legacy into a
more peaceful future for others will be a last-
ing blessing for all.
May it be a comfort to Dr. Hamburg’s chil-
dren, Eric and Margaret, his three grand-
children, David, Rachel and Evan, and all their
loved ones that David has been reunited with
the love of his life, Betty. May it also be a
comfort that so many grieve with them and
pray for them during this sad time.

Thursday, May 16, 2019
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Virginia’s 10th Congressional District who plan
to enlist in the United States Air Force after
graduation. These students have excelled over
the course of their high school careers and I
congratulate them on their graduation and
their future plans.
I commend these student leaders for their
courageous decision to pursue a path to serve
their country as a member of the United
States Air Force. I rise to recognize the fol-
lowing students: Dewan Abdullah, Ishmael
Bobbitt, Mia Broady, Ivanna Jenkins, Michael
Jones, Alexine Koiwood, Kirsten Ladestron,

mony conducted in Sterling, Virginia on May
16, 2019, by the Northern Virginia chapter of
Our Community Salutes and the Blue Star

Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in recognizing and applauding these
students and their families on their pursuits
and wish them the best as they set forth to
begin the process of learning to defend our
great nation and remember that we owe those
who serve a debt of gratitude.
HONORING THE SPANISH COMMU-
NITY CENTER ON ITS 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY
HON. BILL FOSTER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Spanish Community Center’s
50th anniversary.
The Spanish Community Center in Joliet, Il-
linois has long been a valued part of our com-
munity. Over 50 years ago, amid the Civil
Rights movement, the Hernandez, Adler, and
Maher families began providing valuable serv-
ices to the growing local migrant communities.
This local organization became the Spanish
Community Center in 1969. Since then, this
cherished institution has offered valuable so-
cial services to residents of Joliet and the sur-
rounding area. While the Spanish Community
Center began as a response to the needs of
Joliet’s Latino communities, it now proudly of-
fers assistance to all who need it.
I would like to thank the Spanish Commu-
nity Center for its commitment to the citizens
of Illinois and for its contribution to the Joliet
community.

Five: Sergeant Myron L. Trapp, Officer Andy
Reese, Officer Donald F. Reed, Officer Mi-
chael Rainford, and Master Officer Howard
Dallies, Jr.—the officers Garden Grove has

On October 6, 1959, Sergeant Myron L.
Trapp was responding to a call involving a
man who was angry about the noise from road
work on his street. Trapp was trying to talk the
man out of his house when a fellow officer ap-
proached the front door. The man fired his rifle
through the door. He missed the first officer
but struck and killed Trapp.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E608 May 16, 2019
Officer Andy Reese, a reserve officer, was
directing traffic during the Strawberry Festival
on May 30, 1970 when an impatient driver
sped past slow-moving traffic and hit Reese,
killing him.
On June 7, 1980, Officer Donald Reed and
three fellow officers entered a bar to serve a
man with an arrest warrant. Reed was escort-
ing him out the back door when the man drew
and fired a semi-automatic handgun. Reed
was struck in the chest and killed.
Officer Michael Rainford was conducting a
routine traffic stop on a Garden Grove Free-
way on-ramp while on patrol on November 7,
1980. He was killed by a drunk driver.
Master Officer Howard Dallies, Jr. pulled
over a motorcyclist on March 9, 1993. As Dal-
lies approached the motorcycle, the driver
fired six shots at the officer, hitting him four
times. He was rushed to the hospital, where
he died from his wounds.
For the past three decades, the city of Gar-
den Grove has honored the Fallen Five with a
memorial service that brings together family,
friends, and colleagues of the fallen officers,
as well as community organizations and the
public, to pay tribute to the lives and sacrifices
of these men. This year, the theme of the Call
to Duty Police Memorial is ‘The Thin Blue
Line,’ a symbol of law enforcement solidarity.
These five brave men donned the uniform
and badge for the Garden Grove Police De-
partment and they all sacrificed their lives to
keep their community safe. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in honoring these officers
for their service.

IN RECOGNITION OF NELSON
CHAPEL AFRICAN METHODIST
EPISCOPAL CHURCH’S 150TH AN-
NIVERSARY
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it
is my honor and pleasure to extend my sin-
cere congratulations to the congregation of
Nelson Chapel African Methodist Episcopal
(AME) Church in Bainbridge, Georgia as the
church’s membership and leadership celebrate
a remarkable 150 years. The congregation will
celebrate this very significant anniversary on
Sunday, May 19, 2019, at the church located
at 640 Hall Street.
Tracing its roots back to the post-Civil War
era, the church was founded in 1869 when a
group of slaves set off from their landowners’
church and boldly founded their own place of
worship. The original church was located on
Academy Street and was operated under the
leadership of Rev. A. Monroe. During Rev.
Monroe’s tenure as pastor, the church grew
not only in size and in faith, but also in mem-
bership, having included several founding
members who were instrumental to the devel-
opment of the church.
Since its founding, Nelson Chapel AME
Church has endured several additions and
renovations, all of which help tell the story of
the church. In 1902, the church relocated to its
current location on Hall Street to a property
donated by the late Mr. Adam Nelson. The
foundation of the church was laid under the
esteemed leadership of the late Rev. N.L.
Holmes and the building was constructed dur-
ing the pastorship of the late Rev. George
Smith. In the 1970s, under the tutelage of
Rev. C. E. Shepherd, the congregation was
motivated to construct a child development
center to educate preschoolers about Christian
principles and academic excellence. The cen-
ter, which consisted of a fellowship hall, full
kitchen, and a baptismal pool, was named for
the late Dr. J.H. Griffin, M.D. and was man-
aged for many years as the Dr. J.H. Griffin
Educational Complex. In addition to the con-
struction of the church and child development
center, a parsonage was built at 818 Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard for the comfort and
living of the pastoral family.
This ardent community of believers has ex-
tended its circle to include more and more
members as the years have gone by, though
it has never lost its essential character. Today,
the spirit and faith of its people are manifested
through the current sanctuary, which includes
an organ, carpeting, pulpit furniture, a modern
sound system, the Carillon Tower Chimes, a
paved parking lot, office space, and many
other structural improvements. That same faith
and spirit extend beyond the church doors, in
the presence of members who give fully of
themselves wherever they go.
Throughout the years, a number of pastors,
deacons, and clerks have contributed to its
legacy, which boasts more than 300 members,
eight choirs, a 70-member Young People’s Di-
vision (YPD), and many ministries to support
the surrounding community and congregation.
Because of their dedicated efforts, Nelson
Chapel AME Church is the lead church in the
Thomasville/Bainbridge District of the South
Georgia Annual Conference, Sixth Episcopal
District of the African Methodist Episcopal
Church.
The story of Nelson Chapel AME Church,
which recounts a long history of a group of be-
lievers coming together through the good and
difficult times to praise and worship the Lord,
is truly an inspiring one of the dedication and
perseverance of a faithful congregation of peo-
ple who put all their love and trust in God.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the
730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Con-
gressional District, in paying tribute to Nelson
Chapel AME Church in Bainbridge, Georgia
for its congregation’s enduring commitment to
each other and to our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ. May their actions continue to inspire
the community in courage, in dedication, and
in faith.

HONORING THE MACEDONIA BAP-
TIST CHURCH ON THE OCCASION
OF ITS 130TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pride that I rise today to join the con-
gregation of the Macedonia Baptist Church of
Ansonia, Connecticut in extending my heartfelt
congratulations on the celebration of their
130th Anniversary. Throughout its history, the
Church and its congregation have dem-
onstrated a unique commitment to serve the
community and ensure that the most vulner-
able of our citizens could find comfort and re-
sources in their time of need.
In 1889, with the help of local businessman
Franklin Farrel, a group of local African-Amer-
ican residents banded together to organize
and incorporate a mission which would soon
become the Macedonia Baptist Church. In ad-
dition to helping the group organize and incor-
porate the mission, the Farrel family donated
a beautiful stained glass window, which re-
mains even today, as well as the bell for the
belfry. Over the course of the last one hun-
dred thirty years, the Macedonia Baptist
Church has strengthened the bonds of faith
and friendship and has become an iconic fix-
ture in the community.
From its first Pastor, the Reverend Edward
Johnson, who traveled from Yonkers and was
so beloved that parishioners of all ages would
meet him at the train station to escort him to
church, to the Reverend Julian Taylor who
served the ministry for more than four dec-
ades; and from the Reverend V. Loma St.
Clair who expanded the reach of the Mac-
edonia Baptist Church across the community,
to today’s leadership of Pastor Alfred Lee
Smith, Jr., the spiritual guidance that has led
the congregation over time has not only pro-
vided parishioners with nourishment of the
soul but encouraged them to make a dif-
ference in the community as well.
The Macedonia Baptist Church has not only
been a center for religious worship, but a vehi-
cle through which their members could give

back to the community. Our churches play a
vital role in our communities—providing people
with a place to turn to for comfort when they
are most in need. The Macedonia Baptist
Church gives its members a place to find their
spiritual center and to solidify and support
their values. For one hundred thirty years, the
Macedonia Baptist Church has been a fixture
in our community. Through their ministry and
outreach efforts, they have left an indelible
mark on our community and continue to make
a difference in the lives of others. I am proud
to stand today and extend my very best wish-
es to them as they mark this milestone in their
history. Happy 130th Anniversary.

HONORING COPPER HILLS HIGH
SCHOOL TEACHERS STRICKEN BY
CANCER
HON. BEN McADAMS
OF UTAH
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor two courageous teachers at a
West Jordan, Utah high school and the stu-
dents and faculty members who rallied around
them when they were stricken by cancer.
Cancer is an insidious disease that doesn’t
discriminate. It occurs in Utahns of all ages,
incomes, professions and ethnic backgrounds.
But students and faculty at Copper Hills High
School in West Jordan have shown us how a
community stands up to this disease.
Recently, Megan Butler, a physical edu-
cation teacher at the school, along with 17
other faculty members, students and commu-
nity members, all shaved their heads—as part
of a ‘‘Brave to Shave’’ event. It was part of the
school’s effort to raise money for children’s
cancer research. But the hair itself went to-
wards making a wig for Megan Butler, who
was diagnosed with breast cancer. The Cop-
per Hills Grizzlies raised more than $4,000.
Not only was the school dealing with But-
ler’s illness, students also lost a beloved
English teacher—Michelle Szetela—to the dis-
ease. She was diagnosed with Stage four ad-
renal cancer on March 11th and died just six
days later. Tyler Carson, vice president of the
school’s National Honor society chapter,
shaved his head in Szetela’s honor.
All the participants said that events like this
empower them in the fight against a remorse-
less opponent. Their hair will grow back and
someday, the money they contributed to can-
cer research will help produce a cure.
Thank you to these heroic teachers, Megan
Butler and Michelle Szetela, for their courage,
strength and community leadership.

HON. JENNIFER WEXTON

Thursday, May 16, 2019
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 16 high school seniors from
Virginia’s 10th Congressional District who plan
to enlist in the United States Marine Corps
after graduation. These students have ex-
celled over the course of their high school ca-
reers and I congratulate them on their gradua-
tion and their future plans.
I commend these student leaders for their
courageous decision to pursue a path to serve
their country as a member of the United
States Marine Corps. I rise to recognize the
following students: Parsa Bakhshandeh,
Shamar Britton, Jessica Dally, Jamaal Ells-
worth, Andre France, Dylan Gilfedder, Aiden
Hall, Jason Hernandez, Riley Klug, Peter
Komara, Jessica Molnar, Christopher
Nesseltree, Erick Orellana Hernandez, Mat-

Winn.
The students were recognized at a cere-
mony conducted in Sterling, Virginia on May
16, 2019, by the Northern Virginia chapter of
Our Community Salutes and the Blue Star
Mothers of Northern Virginia.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in recognizing and applauding these
students and their families on their pursuits
and wish them the best as they set forth to
begin the process of learning to defend our
great nation and remember that we owe those
who serve a debt of gratitude.

SUPPORTING THE DISASTER
SUPPLEMENTAL BILL
HON. JENNIFFER GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN
OF PUERTO RICO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto Rico.
Madam Speaker, it is urgent to pass a Dis-
aster Supplemental Bill.
Citizens across our nation—from California
to the Carolinas, from Florida to the Northern
Marianas and Puerto Rico, are counting on us
to pass a bill that address the urgent needs
caused by natural disasters.
The more that passage is delayed, the
longer our communities will have to wait, be-
cause just passing the appropriation is the be-
ginning of a drawn-out process.
I know my constituents are waiting, for the
600 million dollars for the Nutritional Assist-
ance Program that I have long been advo-
cating, which will cover a gap in funding under
the supplemental appropriations made in the
immediate aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and
Maria. As of last month, these residents who
have not fully recovered are already seeing a
decrease in benefits because we have yet to
pass a disaster bill.
They are also waiting, like those in many
states and territories, for funds Congress al-
ready appropriated.
For example, after 20 months later, of some
42.3 Billion allocated to Puerto Rico, less than
half has been obligated, and only 12.6 has
been outlayed.
This funding is still being reviewed with
great scrutiny by FEMA, by HUD, by the OMB
Office of Regulatory Affairs.
The funds that have been disbursed are
being used to pay for work already done or
have strict definitions as to what these funds
can be used for.
Conditions and requirements that slow the
flow of funds has resulted in companies and
nonprofits that did work and provided services
are still waiting to get paid.
So I welcome the language included in the
Disaster Supplemental passed by the House,
that provides a firm deadline for OMB to pub-
lish the Federal Register guidance for use of
funds so things can start moving.
I am also encouraged by the provision that
extends the 100 percent federal cost share,
which is essential for communities whose as-
sets and sources of revenue were affected;
and the language that FEMA ‘‘shall’’, rather
than just ‘‘may’’, help rebuild to better stand-
ards. There provisions benefit all affected ju-
risdictions.
One thing we must still address is the defini-
tion of ‘‘critical services’’ eligible for Stafford
Act support, which today does not include im-
portant elements such as first responders,
nonemergency major medical services, solid
waste and stormwater management, and
emergency supply transportation.
That is why I presented H.R. 2242, which I
proposed as an amendment to H.R. 2157 but
was not made in order, to expand the defini-
tion of ‘‘critical services’’ for eligibility for
FEMA disaster Public Assistance.
By allowing these important elements as
critical services, we can ensure that commu-
nities will not need to deal with such a burden
after having their own resources destroyed or
exhausted in the initial response.
For example, not being able to get supplies
out of the port to where they were needed,
and loss of access to major medical services,
worsened the impact on the population in
Puerto Rico.
My proposal would amend the Stafford Act
to include emergency supply transportation,
nonemergency medical, first response and se-
curity services, and solid waste and
stormwater management among the critical
services for which Section 428 may be ap-
plied. I urge that my proposal receive the
needed consideration.
Madam Speaker, it is up to Congress to
continue the support for the recovery of all
communities affected by these disasters. Let
us do that.

CONGRATULATING LAKELAND
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL

Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I want to
send my congratulations to the men and
women of Lakeland Community Hospital in my
hometown of Haleyville, Alabama as it marks
50 years of serving the people of Winston and
Marion counties and the surrounding area.
Lakeland Community Hospital first opened
its doors to patients on Monday, May 19,
1969. Known as Burdick-West Hospital for
many years, it was originally owned by Win-
ston County and governed by a nine-member
hospital board. The original name came from
Mr. Fred Burdick, then Chairman of the Win-
ston County Commission during the establish-
ment of the hospital, and from Haleyville busi-
nesswoman, Ms. Ila West, who donated the
property to the county on which the hospital
sits. The hospital was a two-story structure,
with 32 beds served by 5 doctors. Later, a
third floor was added to the hospital to accom-
modate more patients. Mr. Tillman Hill was the

first hospital administrator and the hospital
thrived for many years under his direction.
Five decades after it opened, Lakeland
Community Hospital is truly living up to its
name, as it is owned and operated by the
community. Now a 49-bed facility, under the
administration of Martha McCormick, the hos-
pital is committed to providing high-quality
medical care in a friendly environment.
Lakeland’s medical staff includes 8 skilled
physicians representing a wide range of med-
ical specialties. The hospital is also equipped
with some of the most advanced medical tech-
nology available today and provides services
such as CT scans, nuclear medicine, digital
mammography, senior care and medical de-
toxification. These tools help their doctors
properly diagnose and treat a wide variety of
illnesses with greater effectiveness than ever
before.
Lakeland Community Hospital is the only
hospital in Winston County, Alabama. Like
many other rural hospitals, it recently faced
the threat of closure. However, due to the
hard work of the leaders such as Haleyville
Mayor Ken Sunseri, the Haleyville City Coun-
cil, the Winston County Commission and citi-
zens of Winston County, the Haleyville Win-
ston County Hospital Authority was created,
and it has partnered with Java Medical to
keep the hospital open and serving those in
the area who need medical care.
I want to send my congratulations to the ad-
ministration and the leadership and staff of
Lakeland Community Hospital for their 50
years of service to the citizens of the entire
area. I’m confident that in the years to come,
Lakeland Community Hospital will be there to
provide high quality healthcare that is needed
to Winston, Marion and surrounding counties.

HONORING EDGAR G. GRIFFIN
HON. JUDY CHU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Edgar
G. Griffin, who passed away in April at the
age of 94. Mr. Griffin was a World War II vet-
eran, proud member of the Knights of Colum-
bus, and a longtime resident of California’s
27th Congressional District.
Mr. Griffin was born in Leon Guanajato,
Mexico on December 7, 1924 and emigrated
to Los Angeles as a teenager with his mother
after the death of his father. Although he held
American citizenship through his father, Mr.
Griffin joined the Army to secure his mother’s
residency. A paratrooper in the 101st airborne
division of the Army, Mr. Griffin survived the
Normandy landing on D–Day in 1944. He was
awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for his
service, as well as a Purple Heart and numer-
ous other medals. At the time of his passing,
Mr. Griffin was the only surviving Mexican-
American veteran of the landing at Normandy.
After the war, Mr. Griffin returned to Cali-
fornia, where he met his wife Mimi and they
raised their nine children together. After first
settling in the City of Commerce while Mr.
Griffin worked in their Aircraft Assembly Radar
Section of Hughes Aircraft, the family eventu-
ally moved to Monterey Park. There, he
worked as a sound and lighting engineer for
the Century Plaza Hotel, until he retired at the
age of 68. He was also an active member of
the Knights of Columbus, elected Grand Night
four times.
Mr. Griffin was due to return to Normandy
next month for the 75th anniversary of the D–
Day invasion. He would have been nearly a
century old and one of very few surviving vet-
erans of the battle that heralded the end of
World War II. While his passing deprived him
of that distinction, I would like to take this op-
portunity to honor the memory of a true Amer-
ican hero.

HONORING UNIVERSITY OF CALI-
FORNIA, SANTA CRUZ CHAN-
CELLOR GEORGE BLUMENTHAL
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the retiring Chancellor of University of
California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), George
Blumenthal, for his 47 years of service to our
community on the central coast of California.
His leadership has touched the lives of many,
and I am honored to acknowledge this legacy.
Chancellor Blumenthal’s record in education
has shown him to be a distinguished pro-
fessor, researcher, and leader to all on the
UCSC campus. He first joined the Astronomy
and Astrophysics Department at UCSC in
1972 and was appointed as Chancellor of the
university in 2007. Committed to expanding
his involvement in public service, Chancellor
Blumenthal has also served on multiple gov-
erning boards in California, including the Cali-
fornia Association for Research in Astronomy,
the California Institute for Regenerative Medi-
cine, the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and
the Monterey Bay Economic Partnership.
Throughout his academic career, Chancellor
Blumenthal’s work has led to numerous
groundbreaking studies and discoveries in our
understanding of galaxies and the interactions
of celestial bodies. His work has transformed
knowledge of concepts once seen only as
science fiction, including the function and be-
havior of dark matter and how it plays a role
in the shaping of the universe. His contribu-
tions cannot be overstated.
A natural leader, Chancellor Blumenthal has
garnered praise from his associates, cowork-
ers, and students. This past year, Santa Cruz
Mayor, Martine Watkins, declared May 9th to
be ‘‘George Blumenthal Day’’ in the city of
Santa Cruz as an annual recognition of his
scholarly and governing efforts. Chancellor
Blumenthal’s decades of service make him
more than worthy of such an honor. As he
celebrates his retirement, I am proud to com-
mend Chancellor Blumenthal on his invaluable
work as an academic leader for the past four
decades. Madam Speaker, on behalf of the
Central Coast, I ask my colleagues to join me
in thanking Chancellor Blumenthal for his con-
tribution to our community and wishing him a
long and healthy retirement.

HON. SUSAN WILD
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Bob Dorough, a constituent of mine
from Mt. Bethel, Pennsylvania.
Bob’s music is universally known: genera-
tions of children have learned about the work
that happens in this Chamber—along with
their earliest lessons in math and science—
from Schoolhouse Rock, which he scored.
Schoolhouse Rock is just one aspect of
Bob’s legacy—his legendary seven-decade
career as a jazz singer led him to play with
many of the greatest musicians in American
history, including Miles Davis and Charlie
Parker. These performances etched his re-
cordings into our country’s soundtrack forever.
A few weeks ago, Bob was posthumously
honored at the Kennedy Center as a recipient
of the 2019 Jazz Master Award—our nation’s
highest recognition for jazz musicians.
Through his family, friends, and each new
generation that continues to discover the
warmth of his voice and the uniquely Amer-
ican music that he loved, Bob’s spirit will en-
dure.

HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Chef Estevan Jimenez for his ex-
emplary community service on the central
coast of California. Chef Jimenez’s important
work with at-risk youth at Ranch Cielo has had
a lasting impact on the community and con-
tinues to inspire young people to pursue ca-
reers in the culinary arts. Recently awarded
the 2019 Chef of the Year by the American
Culinary Federation’s Monterey Bay Chapter,
Chef Jimenez exemplifies the very best of the
Central Coast.
Chef Jimenez attended the California
School of Culinary Arts’ Le Cordon Bleu pro-
gram. He moved to Monterey shortly after
graduating to work as a chef for Bon Appétit
Management, handling the restaurants and
events for the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Al-
ways exuding professionalism and expertise,
Chef Jimenez was promoted in 2007 and
eventually moved on to the position of execu-
tive sous chef at the Ventana Inn in Big Sur.
He then returned to the Monterey Peninsula to
work for Aqua Terra Culinary and eventually
Rancho Cielo’s Drummond Culinary Academy.
Over the years, Chef Jimenez has blazed a
fiery trail in the culinary industry and has al-
ways promoted excellence and encourage-
ment.
As executive chef of the Drummond Cul-
inary Academy, Mr. Jimenez oversees all of
the culinary education programs and acts as a
mentor to underserved and disconnected
youth to provide a path for a brighter future.
Chef Jimenez has also volunteered his time
for a variety of fundraising causes throughout
Monterey County including the United Way,
Salinas Rotary, Kinship Center, ASPCA,
Meals on Wheels, Artichoke Festival, and
Community Christmas Dinner of Monterey. Uti-
lizing his culinary talents, Chef Jimenez has
mentored and prepared our community
throughout his career.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize
the incredible community service of the Amer-
ican Culinary Federation’s Monterey Bay
Chapter 2019 Chef of the Year, Chef Estevan
Jimenez, for his tremendous contributions to
California’s 20th Congressional District. I ask
my distinguished colleagues to join in me in

SILVERDALE PORT COMMIS-

HON. DEREK KILMER
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I would like
to take a moment to celebrate the career of
my constituent, Mr. Lawrence Greaves. Fol-
lowing nearly two decades of service as a
Silverdale Port Commissioner, Mr. Greaves re-
cently retired from the commission, leaving be-
hind an impactful legacy in our region and in
his hometown of Silverdale, Washington.
Mr. Greaves’ family roots were first planted
in Silverdale when his great-grandfather,
Charles Greaves, purchased land in what is
recognized today as downtown Silverdale. Mr.
Greaves was born and raised in Silverdale,
where his parents, Lawrence and Ellen
Greaves, owned a farm and local business.
After graduating from Central Kitsap High
School, he attended the University of Wash-
ington where he earned his bachelor’s degree
in mechanical engineering. Mr. Greaves then
began working for the Shell Oil Company,
which moved his career to Anacortes, Wash-
ington, and then to Wood River and Chicago,
Illinois.
Eventually, Mr. Greaves found his way back
to Silverdale, where he tested torpedoes at
the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division
in Keyport. Following his retirement, Mr.
Greaves began his service as a Commissioner
at the Port of Silverdale, where he spent the
next 20 years overseeing port facilities, as well
as making marked improvements upon the ex-
pansion, improvement, and programming of
the Port of Silverdale.
His dedication to the community and to the
Port of Silverdale will long be recognized, and
I am especially grateful for his continued serv-
ice to our region. Congratulations, Mr.
Greaves.

TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
END OF SRI LANKA’S CIVIL WAR
HON. BRAD SHERMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to
commemorate the tenth anniversary of the
end of Sri Lanka’s thirty-year long civil war.
This Remembrance Day is observed to re-
member and mark the sacrifices made by all
those who died, irrespective of their ethnicity,
in the civil war.
Sadly, the hope that the end of this brutal
war would usher peace in the country, and
that Sri Lanka’s many communities would be
reconciled with each other, has not been real-
ized. The Sri Lankan government won the
war, but it has not yet won peace. The tragic
Easter Sunday bombings in April and tensions
between different communities thereafter are a
reminder of the divisions that still exist in the
country.
The current Sri Lankan government came to
power in 2015 with the overwhelming support
of the Tamil and Muslim communities. These
communities were encouraged by this govern-
ment’s promise to act on allegations of war
crimes and crimes against humanity com-
mitted during the civil war, as outlined in the
September 2015 report by the Office of the
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. In
response to this report, Sri Lanka and the
United States cosponsored UN Human Rights
Commission Resolution 30/1, ‘‘Promoting rec-
onciliation, accountability and human rights in
Sri Lanka,’’ in 2015.
Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan government
has not fulfilled the commitments it made in
that resolution, which, if implemented, would
have promoted justice, peace, and reconcili-
ation in the country. This year, at the Human
Rights Council, Sri Lanka’s government once
again committed itself to reconciliation by co-
sponsoring Resolution 40/1, again titled ‘‘pro-
moting reconciliation, accountability and
human rights in Sri Lanka.’’
I urge the Sri Lankan government to work
towards implementing the provisions of the
resolutions that it has cosponsored. This will
help heal the deep wounds that divide various
communities in Sri Lanka. It can also help Sri
Lanka keep its important commitments to the
international community.

OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, today I rise
to recognize 50 years of outstanding work by
Comerstone Services in Will County, Illinois.
On March 20, 1969 a group of community
members, parents and civic leaders launched
the Will County Sheltered Workshop to create
employment opportunities for adults with dis-
abilities. Later renamed Comerstone Services,
the organization greatly expanded their serv-
ices as the demand for assistance grew.
Since the 1990s, Comerstone has extended
its reach across Will and Kankakee Counties
as they focus on moving individuals in need of
special assistance out of larger facilities and
into smaller neighborhood group homes. In
2018, the program provided a record 187 new
jobs for individuals with disabilities, delivering
over $1.5 million in wages. Today,
Comerstone provides services to over 1,200
people per day.
I would like to thank Comerstone Services
for its commitment to the citizens of Illinois

TRIBUTE TO ELLEN TAUSCHER
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the lifelong contributions
made by Ellen Tauscher, who led the charge
in every aspect of her life, from politics to
world diplomacy and from Wall Street to moth-
erhood.
She was a woman with strong convictions,
a steel backbone, and an unshakable moral
compass. As a Democratic centrist she didn’t
let party politics rule every decision and
bucked a lot of trends.
Ellen never met an obstacle she couldn’t
overcome. Frustrated as a working mother
struggling with lack of access to quality
childcare, she wrote a book to help other
moms and put her money and her time where
her mouth was by founding a service to
screen prospective child-care providers and
donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to
California and Texas schools.
She broke new ground as one of the first
women to hold a seat on the New York Stock
Exchange. At age 25, she was the youngest
woman there ever. Ellen also was an officer
on the American Stock Exchange and worked
as an investment banker and bond trader for
14 years before she became one of the driv-
ing forces behind Sen. DIANNE FEINSTEIN’s
successful 1992 bid for the U.S. Senate.
In 1996, Ellen ran against Congressman
William P. Baker, the Republican incumbent,
in a heavily conservative district in the East
Bay. She won the race, and the votes of many
Republican women, with her common-sense
campaign in favor of access to abortion, in-
creased spending on education, gun-control
legislation, and focus on fiscal responsibility.
She served 13 years in Congress, including
her work in the House Armed Services Com-
mittee, formerly known as the National Secu-
rity Committee, and as chairwoman of the
Strategic Forces Subcommittee.
Ellen’s interest in arms control and nuclear
weapons was a key asset during her tenure
as a diplomat in the Obama Administration.
She was integral to the negotiation of the New
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 2010,
which brought American and Russian nuclear
arsenals to their lowest levels in nearly 60
years. As Hillary Clinton said, ‘‘She made
American and the world safer through her
work on arms control . . .’’
And she did all of this with a beautifully in-
fectious smile that lit up any room she en-
tered.
My heart goes out to Ellen’s daughter, Kath-
erine, and her other family members who lost
her far too soon. I can only hope that they are
able to take some comfort in knowing Ellen’s
legacy to make the world a better, safer place
will live on.
INTRODUCTION OF THE DUCK
BOAT SAFETY ACT, TO IMPLE-
MENT SAFETY REGULATIONS
RELATED TO AMPHIBIOUS PAS-
SENGER VESSELS AND FOR
OTHER PURPOSES
HON. ANDRÉ CARSON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I
am pleased to reintroduce the Duck Boat
Safety bill, to implement safety regulations for
amphibious passenger vessels. These safety
recommendations were made by federal agen-
cies to address known problems associated
with duck boats that have resulted in far too
many injuries and fatalities.
I became aware of these problems when my
constituents, the Coleman family, were in-
volved in a horrible duck boat accident on July
19, 2018 in Branson, Missouri. Tia Coleman
was one of only two survivors in her family of
11, losing her husband Glenn and her children
Reece (nine years old), Evan (seven years
old), and Arya (one year old). Tia’s 13-year-
old nephew, Donovan Coleman, was the other
surviving family member, losing his mother
Angela, his younger brother Maxwell (two
years old), his uncles Ervin (76 years old) and
Butch (70 years old), and his aunt Belinda (69
years old). Boarding a duck boat on Table
Rock Lake started out as a fun outing for this
family, but it turned into an unspeakable trag-
edy when the boat capsized and sank. Seven-
teen of the 31 passengers on board were
killed.
Investigations by state and federal authori-
ties are still underway, and lawsuits are pend-
ing over the specifics of this incident. But
there is a long record of problems associated
with duck boat operations that should be ad-
dressed now. Since 1999, more than 40 peo-
ple have died in duck boat accidents, the vast
majority of them from drowning when the ves-
sel sinks. In 2002, the National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB) issued recommendations
to improve the safety of the vessels in cases
of flooding or sinking, but little has been done
to implement those measures. We know from
these past incidents that more can be done to
make these vessels safe. Congress does not
need to wait to act.
While we wait to learn more about the spe-
cific circumstances and causes that led to the
tragedy on Table Rock Lake, this legislation
would implement the NTSB’s past rec-
ommendations to improve the ability of duck
boats (officially referred to as ‘‘amphibious
passenger vessels’’) to stay afloat in a flood-
ing or sinking situation.
Specifically, this bill would direct the Coast
Guard to issue regulations within one year of
enactment to require operators of amphibious
passenger vessels to retrofit their vessels to
provide reserve buoyancy. Vessel operators
would have no longer than two years to com-
ply with the requirements.
While vessel operators work to comply with
the reserve buoyancy requirements, this bill di-
rects them to implement interim measures to
improve vessel safety, including:
a. Removing canopies from vessels for wa-
terborne operations, or replacing canopies
with structures that do not restrict escape in
the event of flooding or sinking;
b. If canopies are removed, requiring that all
passengers wear a personal flotation device
while the vessel is on the water;
c. Permanently closing all unnecessary ac-
cess plugs and reducing through-hull penetra-
tions to the minimum number and size nec-
essary;
d. Installing independently-powered electric
bilge pumps;
e. Installing no fewer than four independ-
ently-powered bilge alarms;
f. Mandating inspection of vessels in water
after each through-hull penetration;
g. Verifying watertight integrity of vessels in
the water at the outset of each waterborne de-
parture; and
h. Otherwise complying with existing Coast
Guard regulations related to the inspection,
configuration, and operation of such vessels.
Those vessels that do not meet the one-
year deadline to implement interim safety
measures, as well as those that do not meet
the two-year deadline to install reserve buoy-
ancy systems, would be prohibited from oper-
ating on U.S. waterways until they are compli-
ant.
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will
join me in supporting this bill to make com-
mon-sense corrections to the persistent safety
problems facing duck boats so that no other
family must face the kind of tragedy experi-
enced by my constituents on Table Rock
Lake. I urge the House to support this bill.

INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to voice my support for the 7th an-
nual Infrastructure Week, which runs May 13
through 20. America’s businesses, workers,
citizens, and elected leaders from all levels of
government are all united around one mes-
sage: America’s future will be shaped by the
infrastructure choices we make today.
In the 116th Congress, my fellow Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee colleagues
and I are working across the aisle to achieve
key objectives for the people, including cre-
ating and sustaining family-wage jobs, improv-
ing the daily lives of Americans, preserving
and protecting our environment, building sus-
tainable and resilient communities, and ensur-
ing U.S. economic competitiveness.
Specifically, in my home state of Texas, we
have worked to establish milestones such as
laying the groundwork for the Texas Central
high-speed passenger rail line, which will con-
nect the fourth and fifth largest economies in
the country in less than 90 minutes. In Dallas,
there are currently over $2 billion dollars in ac-
tive highway projects and an additional $1.5
billion in design-build projects. In Congres-
sional District 30 alone, there are $1 billion
dollars’ worth of projects under construction.
Other investments include a new 26-mile re-
gional transit passenger rail line, an airport
runway realignment project, and expansions of
one of the largest inland ports as well as
major interstates and highways. These efforts
have contributed to a $70-billion-dollar eco-
nomic impact and nearly 67,000 jobs.
While we are focused on the need for sus-
tainable infrastructure, we must also highlight

the need for diversity and inclusion as well.
We must recognize the importance of having
individuals with various backgrounds at the
table, creating innovative solutions to address
new transportation needs that truly help all
communities. Programs such as the U.S. De-
partment of Transportation’s Women & Girls in
Transportation Initiative (WITI) or the Small
Business Administration’s 8(a) Business De-
velopment Program are great opportunities to
foster an inclusive environment that encour-
ages, supports, and celebrates our similarities
and differences.
Above all, Infrastructure Week highlights the
apparent need for investment. Our nation’s in-
frastructure is crumbling, and we can’t wait an-
other day to act. At this critical juncture, it is
imperative that Congress moves with expedi-
ency in addressing these pressing issues, as
it is essential to the quality of life of our citi-
zens and the vitality of our economy.

SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS
ACT, 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. AL LAWSON, JR.
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 10, 2019
The House in the Committee of the
Whole House on the state of the Union
had under consideration the bill (H.R.
2157) making supplemental appropria-
tions for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2019, and for other purposes.
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam Chair, I
rise to express my support for H.R. 2157, the
Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2019. This
$17.2 billion package is essential to providing
critical relief to communities that were hit by
natural disasters in 2018 and 2019, including
my Congressional District, Florida’s Fifth.
More than seven months has passed since
Hurricane Michael made landfall in Florida and
citizens are still reeling from the historic Cat-
egory 5 storm. Our community has a long way
to go on the road to recovery, including our
timber industry and forests.
My support for this disaster supplemental
package comes in part because of an under-
standing that the language within Title I of this
bill grants the Secretary of Agriculture the dis-
cretion to provide assistance to producers who
suffered timber loss due to Hurricanes Michael
and Florence.
In the 11 counties in Florida hit by Hurricane
Michael, more than 16,000 forest land owners
reported damage to their timber. The storm
destroyed more than 72 million tons of timber,
totaling over $1.3 billion in economic loss.
Forest lands are essential to North Florida’s
economy and ecology, and we must do every-
thing to ensure we get it back on track. I look
forward to working with my colleagues in both
Chambers of Congress, as well as with the
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, to ensure that
North Florida’s forestlands are supported as
we recover from Hurricane Michael.
HONORING THE CENTENNIAL OF
THE TRUXTUN COMMUNITY IN
PORTSMOUTH, VIRGINIA
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to commemorate a historic neigh-
borhood in the Hampton Roads region of Vir-
ginia. The Historic Truxtun Community in
Portsmouth, Virginia will celebrate its centen-
nial on May 18, 2019. To mark the occasion,
I would like to take a moment to highlight the
history of this neighborhood and recognize its
contributions to our community.
The community of Truxtun was named after
Thomas Truxtun, a Revolutionary War sailor
who was known for successfully capturing Brit-
ish ships during the Revolutionary War. He
went on to captain the USS Constellation and
the USS President. There have been six
United States Navy ships named in his honor.
The Truxtun community sits on 43 acres of
land within walking distance of the Norfolk
Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia. It was
constructed in 1918 as a project of the U.S.
Housing Corporation to address the housing
shortage for shipbuilders employed at the Nor-
folk Naval Shipyard. At the time, the United
States had just entered World War I and the
newly developed Naval Operating Base was
gearing up to assist with the war effort.
Truxtun stands out in United States history
as the first government housing project devel-
oped for African-Americans. The neighborhood
had 250 lots consisting of duplexes and five-
bedroom single family homes. The homes in
Truxtun had a distinguished style—exposed
rafter ends, jerkinhead roofs, and central chim-
neys. Truxtun homes also offered indoor
plumbing and electricity at a time where many
people, especially African Americans, did not
have access to such amenities. Despite the
modern architecture and amenities in Truxtun,
it was still a segregated community. Because
of the Supreme Court’s 1896 decision in
Plessy v. Ferguson, Jim Crow segregation
laws forced blacks to reside in Truxtun while
whites lived in their own nearby government
housing project called Cradock.
Those who relocated to Truxtun considered
the community tightknit and vibrant. Rents
were affordable and started at $17.50 per
month. Southern black workers were happy to
abandon their agricultural lives and start fresh
with higher wages and improved working con-
ditions. Truxtun helped transformed the Hamp-
ton Roads region and the region benefitted
economically, socially and culturally.
The Truxtun community was developed with
a ‘‘new urbanism’’ style and had everything a
town needed to thrive. From its own conven-
ience store, school and church to civic
leagues and sporting events, this town pro-
vided residents a place to live, play and shop
within an easy commute to the shipyard. The
neighborhood had four policemen, a town
manager and even a townhouse to do official
work. Since Truxtun was formed as an inde-
pendent township within what was then Nor-
folk county, its locally elected town manager
could levy taxes and provide public services.
That is, until Portsmouth acquired the commu-
nity in 1923.
100 years after its founding, Truxtun is ex-
periencing a revival that places it as one of
Portsmouth’s most prized cultural centers. In
1982, Truxtun was listed on the National Reg-
ister of Historic Places. It was one of the first
out of about 100 federally financed housing
projects during World War I, and it remains a
national model for communities that are look-
ing to plan and build inclusive, pedestrian-
friendly neighborhoods.
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the resi-
dents of Truxtun on their centennial celebra-
tion and for helping to make Portsmouth a
great place to live and raise a family.

CELEBRATING WORLD DOG DAY
2019
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to rise today to recognize and celebrate
World Dog Day 2019, which will take place on
Saturday, May 18th in West Hollywood, CA.
Created by my good friend, Lisa Vanderpump
and the Vanderpump Dog Foundation in 2016,
World Dog Day is a day focusing on the cele-
bration of our furriest family members by rec-
ognizing the impact that dogs bring to our ev-
eryday lives. This celebration draws attention
to the amazing, empathetic creatures that
dogs are, while also raising awareness about
global dog abuse that sadly still exists today.
Our love for these animals, without the nec-
essary activism, can’t protect themselves from
abuse or neglect. This event is so critically im-
portant in taking a stand against the abuse of
animals and being united in the love that we
hold so dear for our beloved dogs.
Sadly, dogs and other animals across our
nation and around the world suffer abuse from
animal fighting, to torture, inhumane research
testing, and abuse in puppy mills. We must
advocate for all animals who cannot defend
themselves and ensure their overall well-being
and safety.
In the 115th Congress, I was proud to work
with Lisa, Dr. John Sessa, and the
Vanderpump Dog Foundation on passing H.
Res. 401, a resolution urging all nations to
outlaw the dog and cat meat trade and to en-
force existing laws against such trade. Their
steadfast leadership and unwavering commit-
ment to the welfare of animals is truly inspir-
ing. Passage of H. Res. 401 was a culmina-
tion of years of hard work and dedication.
From the bottom of my heart, I cannot thank
them enough, along with the thousands of ac-
tivists around the country and across the
globe for all of their efforts. Lisa, John, and
the Vanderpump Dog Foundation have never
wavered in their commitment in the fight
against the global dog meat trade. I am hon-
ored to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them
to champion this effort, sending a strong sig-
nal to the world that the welfare of animals
must be taken seriously.
As we celebrate World Dog Day 2019, we
must come together to raise awareness about
global dog abuse and work to end this horrific
and barbaric practice once and for all.
Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate Lisa
Vanderpump, Dr. John Sessa, and the
Vanderpump Dog Foundation on what I am
certain will be another successful World Dog
Day. I look forward to our continued work on
animal welfare issues for years to come.

HONORING DR. STUART DORSEY
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor Dr. Stuart Dorsey, an ed-
ucator, an innovator, and a leader.
Dr. Dorsey currently serves as the President
of Texas Lutheran University in Seguin,
Texas. He began his tenure in the summer of
2011 and will conclude his work at TLU on
June 30, 2019.
Dr. Dorsey’s story is one that exhibits com-
mitment and dedication at every turn. Dr. Dor-
sey earned his bachelor’s degree in econom-
ics from the University of South Dakota. From
there, he earned both his Master and doctor of
philosophy in economics from Washington
University in St. Louis, Missouri. He then
served the public in the U.S. Department of
Labor before joining the U.S. Senate Com-
mittee on Finance where he was the Commit-
tee’s Chief Economist from 1982 to 1984.
Dr. Dorsey then began his career in aca-
demia as an associate professor of economics
at West Virginia University. He went on to
serve as Dean of the Faculty at Baker Univer-
sity in Kansas and then as Vice President for
Academic Affairs at the University of Evans-
ville in Indiana. Afterward, he served as the
President of the University of Redlands in
California until he became the President of
Texas Lutheran University.
Over the past eight years, Dr. Dorsey
oversaw tremendous change to the univer-
sity’s campus and culture. Under his leader-
ship, the university completed a freshmen resi-
dence hall, a studio theatre, and a School of
Music building. Dr. Dorsey also oversaw the
completion of Bulldog Stadium, which has al-
lowed the university to host football games
and track and field events on campus for the
first time in its history. Through these accom-
plishments, Dr. Dorsey has laid a strong foun-
dation for the university to continue its suc-
cess.
Furthermore, Dr. Dorsey expanded the uni-
versity’s academic influence by leading the
creation of several new programs of study, in-
cluding a popular undergraduate program in
nursing and graduate programs in accounting,
data analytics, and athletic training.
Dr. Dorsey has worked tirelessly to expand
opportunities for the students and community
of TLU. His unwavering devotion to his stu-
dents’ success is evident and furthered by his
wife Michelle’s equally impressive dedication
to service. Through their combined efforts, the
university was named a Great College to Work
for seven years in a row.
Madam Speaker, Dr. Dorsey has worked
endlessly to make a difference in the lives of
Central Texans. His efforts have made him a
pillar of the community and an example to us
all. It is an honor to represent selfless, com-
mitted individuals like him. I wish him and his
wife Michelle nothing but the best as they
begin retirement in California.
HONORING OHIO’S LAW ENFORCE-
MENT AND EFFORTS TO KEEP
THEM SAFE
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the brave men and women
of Ohio’s law enforcement. As a former pros-
ecutor, I know all too well the danger our he-
roes in blue face every day to protect us and
our families, and I applaud the efforts made to
ensure their safety.
Just the other night, in observance of Na-
tional Police Week, I was proud to vote to re-
authorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership
Grant Program, which provides critical re-
sources to state, local and tribal jurisdictions
to purchase bulletproof body armor for law en-
forcement officers.
For 30 years, bullet-resistant body armor
has protected law enforcement officers. Ac-
cording to the Bureau of Justice Assistance, in
2012 alone, protective vests were directly at-
tributable to saving the lives of at least 33 law
enforcement and corrections officers in 20 dif-
ferent states.
However, much of the body armor used
today slows down and fatigues our officers
due to overbearing weight and discomfort lev-
els. As arms and ammunitions continue to be-
come more powerful, we must do the nec-
essary research to develop next generation
body armor that addresses these challenges.
I am proud to say that we have organiza-
tions in Ohio, like ShotStop, that are doing just
that. Due to their light weight and dynamic
material, ShotStop’s bullet-resistant products
create a safer environment for the brave men
and women in blue who put their lives on the
line every day to protect our communities.
Madam Speaker, please join me in applaud-
ing ShotStop and all other organizations that
are working to ensure our officers are better
equipped to return home safely to their loved
ones at the end of each shift. I am proud to
support Ohio’s law enforcement officers, not
just during National Police Week, but each
and every day, and commend those who are
doing all they can to protect them.

INTRODUCTION OF THE AFGHAN
ALLIES PROTECTION ACT OF 2019
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today
I introduced the Afghan Allies Protection Act of
2019. This bipartisan legislation would author-
ize 4,000 Afghan Special Immigrant Visas and
require the State Department to report to Con-
gress on the obstacles to protecting Iraqi and
Afghan allies as well as suggestions for im-
proving the program.
Since 2002, the United States Government
has employed thousands of Afghan and Iraqi
allies to serve alongside U.S. troops, dip-
lomats, and other government employees. As
a result of their service, these allies and their
families have become the targets of anti-
American persecution and violence. As U.S.
Government agencies and personnel continue
to rely on local partners to ensure critical mis-
sion capabilities, Afghan and Iraqi partners
continue to be threatened, abducted, or assas-
sinated for their willingness to assist the
United States.
With broad bipartisan support, Congress
created two Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) pro-
grams to provide pathways to safety for Iraqis
and Afghans whose work with and allegiance
to the U.S. Government has exposed them to
direct threats, jeopardizing their safety and
that of their loved ones. Although the Iraqi SIV
program stopped accepting new applications
in 2014, the Afghan SIV program continues
protecting Afghan allies to this day.
In recent years, the SIV applicant backlog
has continued to grow while Congress has
struggled to allot enough visas to bring our al-
lies to safety in the United States. While the
recent Fiscal Year 2019 omnibus spending bill
authorized 3,500 SIVs, the backlog remains at
nearly 20,000 Afghans. Worse, the processing
times for existing applications has slowed dra-
matically, forcing many to wait for years while
living in fear of being targeted. Due to these
issues and others facing the program, SIV ar-
rivals have fallen by more than half over the
last fiscal year.
This legislation makes more visas available
for the thousands of applicants in the pipeline
and starts the process of improving the pro-
gram so our allies can be brought to safety
faster. The safety of these brave men and
women, security of our troops, and our inter-
national standing depend on the United States
be true to our word. We can’t leave anyone
behind.

the cooperative business model, Mr. Brodsky
has dedicated his life to helping entrepreneurs
and small business compete in the global mar-
ketplace.
As the Chairman, Co-founder, and Co-Chief
Executive Officer of CCA Global Partners, Mr.
Brodsky created the second largest private
company in the state of New Hampshire, com-
prised of 13 affiliated companies with total
sales of over $10 billion. Mr. Brodsky has
dedicated his career to building a model for
small businesses to succeed in an unpredict-
able international economy. With a commit-
ment to global cooperation and a focus on giv-
ing small businesses the tools and connec-
tions needed to compete at scale, Mr. Brodsky
and his colleagues at CCA are helping foster
a more equal society and economy.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
congratulate Howard Brodsky on this well-de-
served award. I also thank the World Affairs
Council of New Hampshire for continuing to

ACKNOWLEDGING LEADERSHIP NI-
AGARA’S 2019 LEADERS OF THE
YEAR AWARD RECIPIENTS
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I proudly rise to recognize the impressive
record of achievement of Leadership Niagara,
the longest running leadership development
organization in New York State.
Headquartered in Niagara Falls, a city I proud-
ly represent and home to one of the Wonders
of the World, this binational program provides
individuals of all ages the skills necessary to
forge a better and more productive future for
themselves, their companies and the commu-
nities of Western New York and Southern On-
tario.
For more than 35 years, Leadership Niagara
has served as a premier leadership resource
to those who demonstrate the passion, desire
and willingness to work to effect positive
change in all aspects of their lives, including
the companies and communities they rep-
resent.
Leadership Niagara’s mission to strengthen
regional leadership is reflected in their time-
honored tradition of the Annual Leader of the
Year Awards Ceremony. Now in its 29th year,
this program delivers a powerful message that
builds on the example, motivation and success
of those being recognized for their trans-
formational leadership in a variety of fields.
This year, Leadership Niagara has selected
five individuals and one organization that ex-
emplify collaboration, innovation and leader-
ship. They include Kenneth Sass, Lifetime
Achievement Award, Father James J. Maher,
Leader of the Year; The Niagara Falls Boys
and Girls Club, Organization of the Year;
Bonnie Kane Ph.D., Distinguished Alumni;
Alicia Laible-Kenyon, Emerging Leader and
Ethan Menges, Youth Leader. These hon-
orees are most deserving for the strides they
have made in the promotion of positive
change and strong leadership regardless of
title, age, education, industry or boundaries.
Kenneth Sass served a community in need
with determination and kindness as the long-
time president of Pinnacle Community Serv-
ices, formerly Family and Children’s Services
of Niagara. Before retiring in December of
2018, Mr. Sass worked for Pinnacle Commu-
nity Services for 25 years, the past 21 as
president and CEO. It was during his tenure
that he spearheaded two capital campaigns,
totaling $3.3 million, to build the agency’s first
new headquarters in 100 years and the Niag-
ara Family Center, a multi-service collabora-
tion between seven nonprofit agencies. Pro-
grams were also expanded and developed to
better address serious issues including mental
health, domestic violence, child abuse and
chronic medical illnesses. His dedication to
those he served epitomize what it means to
be a compassionate leader.
Father James J. Maher’s selection as Lead-
ership Niagara’s Leader of the Year is an in-
spired choice. A member of the Vincentian
community, he was appointed the 26th presi-
dent of Niagara University in 2013. Since be-
coming president, Father Maher has focused
on advancing the academic reputation of the
university, building an international and di-
verse campus community and shaping the uni-
versity’s commitment to the revitalization of Ni-
agara Falls and Western New York. His deep
commitment to the Vincentian mission of serv-
ice is reflected in his actions and words that
included his belief that ‘‘Niagara University
should function as a bridge to people in every-
day distress, isolation and poverty.’’ Father
Maher is that bridge.
The Niagara Falls Boys and Girls Club is
Leadership Niagara’s organization of the year
for their commitment to serving the community
and creating healthy youth and families. For
more than 80 years, they have focused on
academic success, career and leadership de-
velopment. With an annual membership of
over 1400 young people, ranging from five to
twenty-one years old, the Niagara Falls Boys
and Girls Club lives its mission to provide ap-
propriate and diversified programs and activi-
ties that teach skills needed to build positive
lives, attitudes & behaviors. An invaluable
community asset, their dedication to edu-
cation, healthy living and leadership provides
a model to follow for other Western New York
organizations.
Bonnie Kane, Ph.D., has been a Leadership
Niagara member since 2017 and is being rec-
ognized as this year’s Distinguished Alumni.
Since receiving her M.A. in School Psychology
from the University of Buffalo and a Ph.D. in
Leadership and Policy from Niagara Univer-
sity, this principled and purposeful dynamo
has worked in the Niagara Falls City School
District as a school psychologist and as co-de-
partment chair for special education. Her com-
mitment to lifting the lives of others is evi-
denced by her ability to listen, learn and guide
students on career paths while promoting the
importance of education and mentorship. Dr.
Kane is a treasured resource whose belief in
the dignity and rights of all people makes our
community a better place to live.
This year’s Emerging Leader is Alicia
Laible-Kenyon, Executive Director of
Elderwood Health Plan (Niagara Advantage).
Responsible for the outcomes of this managed
long-term care plan, Alicia has led this effort to
provide access to affordable and quality health
care for individuals with chronic health issues
and older adults. Her efforts enable many oth-
ers to remain healthy, independent and able to
reside in their own homes. Unafraid of a chal-
lenge, her commitment to ensuring a healthier
community makes her a worthy recipient.
Leadership Niagara understands age is no
barrier to leadership and has recognized this
potential in Ethan Menges of Lockport High
School as this year’s Youth Leader. As a stu-
dent athlete, he leads by example on and off
the field. Through his years at Lockport High
School, he has been an active participant in
career, education and life skills development
programs through internships and community
events. He understands that he and his class-
mates must be prepared and ready to be a
part of positive and constructive interaction in
today’s world and is a model example of what
it means to be a leader.
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Leadership
Niagara for its significant contributions to the
Western New York Community as they gather
together on May 17 to honor this year’s most
worthy recipients at the Leader of the Year
Awards Ceremony.

HONORING UNITA ZELMA
BLACKWELL
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Unita
Zelma Blackwell on her great contributions to
civil rights activism.
Born in Lula in 1933 into a sharecropping
family, Blackwell left Mississippi as a child to
attend school in West Helena, Arkansas, be-
cause black children weren’t allowed to con-
sistently attend school at that time in the Mis-
sissippi Delta. Blackwell forfeited school at the
eighth grade and began sharecropping with
her family.
During the early 70s, Blackwell became an
important pillar in the civil rights movement in
the South. She served as a project director
and field secretary for the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC), helping or-
ganize voter drives for African Americans
across Mississippi. These efforts landed her in
jail at least 70 times.
In 1967, she co-founded Mississippi Action
Community Education, a community develop-
ment organization which helped districts to in-
corporate as towns. Incorporation enabled
them to set their geographical boundaries so
that they could have a legal identity-an impor-
tant advantage when they wanted government
help in installing streetlights or electricity.
In 1976, Unita Blackwell became the first Af-
rican American woman mayor in the state of
Mississippi (Mayersville, MS) where she devel-
oped the city’s infrastructure with an annual
$30,000 budget. She also served as an ad-
viser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson, Richard
Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald
Reagan and Bill Clinton.
Blackwell’s career path was very diverse:
Key organizer, Mississippi Freedom Demo-
cratic Party, 1964; National President of the
U.S.-China People’s Friendship Association,
1977 through 1983; elected Mayor of
Mayersville, 1976 through 2001; had the town
incorporated, 1976; appointed by President
Carter to the U.S. National Commission on the
International Year of the Child, 1979; vice-
chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party,
1976 through 1980; established Mayors’ Ex-
change Program between U.S. and China;
1984; national president of the National Con-
ference of Black Mayors, 1990 through 1992.
Notable awards achieved by Blackwell:
Southern Christian Leadership Award, 1990;
Institute of Politics Fellow, John F. Kennedy
School of Government, Harvard University,
1991; MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant,
1992; APA leadership award for elected offi-
cial, 1994; honored with a Mississippi Free-
dom Trail marker, 2016.
Her son, Jeremiah Blackwell, Jr., informed
Mississippi Today of his mother’s death on
Monday, May 13, 2019 at age 86.
Madam Speaker, today I honor the life of
Ms. Unita Blackwell for her many contributions
to education, civil rights, and the great state of
Mississippi. Blackwell made a career of serv-
ing others, and her work had a direct and
positive influence on the lives of thousands.

OBESITY
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, the Obesity epidemic is a long-
standing issue in American society with two-
thirds of our population being affected by ex-
cess weight. This nation is facing the con-
sequences of limited policies and funding to
resolve this public health issue. Obesity af-
fects all populations but some groups are dis-
proportionately impacted such as racial and
ethnic minorities. According to the Department
of Health and Human Services, African Amer-
ican women have the highest rates of being
overweight or obese with about 4 out of 5
women fitting the description. Constituents in
my district are also highly affected by this phe-
nomenon. A National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination survey revealed that in the North
Lawndale community in Chicago 46.4 percent
of children aged 2–12 were considered obese.
This is unacceptable especially when com-
pared to the national average of childhood
obesity which is 18.5 percent. Therefore, we
must examine the factors that lead to such
disparities. One primary factor in my district
that contributes to this issue are food deserts.
The lack of access to healthy food options is
due to both the lack of food retail businesses
and income within these communities. Unfor-
tunately, high-calorie foods are less expensive
and more available in neighborhoods with
more corner stores than supermarkets. Addi-
tionally, there is a lack of safe, accessible
places to walk, bike, and play in low-income
neighborhoods, leaving residents with very few
options. Health policies and programs need to
be promoted in every sector from schools to
local businesses to grassroots organizations.
Addressing this epidemic will require us to
work together to garner resources to battle
obesity at the federal, state, and community
levels. These resources could help commu-
nities facing health disparities fund projects
such as community gardens and rebuilding
playgrounds to get them on a path to healthier
living. It is imperative that we address the
issue of obesity to ensure the health of the
country.

IN RECOGNITION OF IRENE
SCHAFER
HON. KELLY ARMSTRONG
OF NORTH DAKOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor an outstanding constituent, a
friend, and a truly remarkable woman, Irene
Schafer.
May 16 is Irene’s 89th birthday, and I can
attest that those 89 years have been spent
tirelessly serving those around her. Service to
her community is who Irene is.
Irene is active with many civic and leader-
ship groups in Dickinson, including the Dickin-
son Area Builders Association, Badlands
Board of Realtors, Dickinson Rotary Club,
Chamber of Commerce, St. Joseph’s Hospital
Foundation’s Charity Ball Committee, Dickin-
son State University Alumni Association’s
Yuletyme Committee, AAUW, United Way,
Elks Lodge, District 36 GOP, as well as a
member of the Post Office Consumer Advisory
Committee.
Even so, Irene was not satisfied with her
level of community service. In 2016, Irene
founded a new group, the Power of 100
Women, to gather women four times per year
to each donate $100 to a deserving nonprofit
organization.
The Power of 100 Women donated more
than $15,000 to help open Hope’s Landing, a
sober-living home in Dickinson for women suf-
fering from addiction. The group donated
$10,000 to the Dickinson Backpack Program
to purchase 2,000 backpacks for school-
children in need. Most recently, the group do-
nated $20,000 to Project H.E.R.O. (Helping
Educators Reach Out), a non-profit organiza-
tion ensuring that children are eating lunch
every day. Since its founding, the organiza-
tion’s members have donated over $240,000
to community-serving organizations.
Irene’s mission in life is to build a great
community and she is doing that every day
through her community service.
My warmest greetings to Irene on her 89th
birthday. Blessings to her and her family on
this special occasion.

INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION
HONORING RETIRED HOUSE JU-
DICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
JOHN CONYERS, JR. ON THE OC-
CASION OF HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I am
pleased to introduce this resolution honoring
retired Congressman John Conyers on the oc-
casion of his 90th Birthday. Congressman
Conyers was born in Highland Park, Michigan,
on May 16, 1929, and grew up in the city of
Detroit. Like many men of his generation, he
served in the military and was stationed in
Korea, during the Korean War, as an officer in
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, where he
was awarded combat and merit citations.
Following the completion of his military serv-
ice, he earned both his B.A. (1957) and LL.B.
(1958) degrees from Wayne State University
and became an active member of the Michi-
gan Bar. He had the distinction of working on
the staff of Congressman John Dingell, serv-
ing as counsel to Detroit-area labor union
locals and as a referee for Michigan’s work-
men’s compensation department.
His commitment to civil rights was forged
during the great movement of the 1960’s,
when traveling throughout the South, and was
in Selma, Alabama, for the Freedom Day voter
registration drive in 1963. In correspondence,
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., would
later remark that Conyers presence in Selma,
Alabama ‘‘had an electric effect on the
voteless and beleaguered Negro citizens of
this city, state and nation.’’
Conyers legislative career began in 1964
when he ran for an open seat in Michigan’s
1st District, following the landmark 1964 Baker
v. Carr decision, and defeated his opponent
with 84 percent of the vote. In this race, Con-
gressman Conyers received the only known
political endorsement from Dr. King and Rosa
Parks, known for her prominent role in the
Montgomery, Alabama bus boycott, moved to
Detroit and served on Conyers’ staff between
1965 and 1988.
Congressman Conyers went on to serve 26
terms, winning re-election twenty-five times,
and is the third longest-serving member of the
House in history, and the sixth longest-serving
member of Congress in history. He was one of
the 13 members who founded the Congres-
sional Black Caucus in 1969 and was consid-
ered the Dean of the Caucus during his ten-
ure.
As a freshman member, Congressman Con-
yers won a seat on the Judiciary Committee
and went on to serve as Chairman of that
committee from 2007 to 2011, along with serv-
ing as the ranking Democratic member on the
Committee from 1995 to 2007 and again from
2011 to 2017. During his tenure, he success-
fully worked to oppose initiatives that violated
Constitutional values and served as a beacon
of hope to those facing poverty and injustice.
He was the first member to introduce legisla-
tion or hold hearings on an important series of
civil rights issues, including: police mis-
conduct; LGBTQ protections; violence against
the Arab and Muslim American communities;
AIDS in the African-American community; en-
vironmental racism; and restorative justice,
just to name a few.
Over the course of his legislative career,
Congressman Conyers was responsible for
more than 100 bills, amendments, and resolu-
tions being enacted, including 57 on which he
was the overall lead sponsor, and an addi-
tional 56 that he managed or was the lead
Democratic sponsor. From his position on the
Judiciary Committee, he led many of our most
notable legislative efforts on civil rights and
civil liberties, including: the Martin Luther King
Holiday Act, the Voting Rights act Reauthor-
izations, the Violence Against Women Act Re-
authorizations, the Hate Crimes Prevention

Act, Pattern and Practice Enforcement Act, the
USA Freedom Act, the Fair Sentencing Act,
the ‘‘Motor Voter’’ Act, and the Innocence Pro-
tection Act.
For these reasons, Congressman Conyers
is recognized as a champion of civil rights and
civil liberties, receiving numerous honors, in-
cluding the NAACP Spingarn Medal and the
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human
Rights Hubert H. Humphrey Award. Always a
leader and gentleman, Congressman Conyers
walked the halls of this institution for more
than 50 years, leaving a lasting impact
through his dedication to freedom and justice
for all people.
Like so many in this body, I am proud to
have been his colleague and friend. The cele-
bration of his 90th birthday is an ideal time to
reflect on his accomplishments and celebrate
his distinguished legislative career. His dedica-
tion and commitment to service is an example
for us all. He will always be the Chairman.

THE EQUALITY ACT
HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 16, 2019
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in strong and steadfast support of
the Equality Act.
We’ve made a lot of progress in recent
years, but the reality is that many still face dis-
crimination because of who they are and the
people they love.
In Texas, the discrimination and inequality
faced by the LGBTQ community is heart-
breaking and entirely un-American, but with
the Equality Act we can do something about it.
The Equality Act will greatly extend civil
rights for the LGBTQ community, providing
consistent and explicit protections from dis-
crimination for LGBTQ people across key
areas of life including employment, housing,
credit, and education.
In Texas, that means having explicit protec-
tions for LGBTQ people for the first time in our
history. Updating federal law will tear down
barriers to prosperity and lead to better out-
comes for our family members, neighbors, and
loved-ones.
This is long overdue for nearly 1 million
LGBTQ Texans and is why I urge all of my
colleagues to make the Equality Act the law of
the land.
