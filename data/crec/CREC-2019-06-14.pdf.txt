PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:
God, our Father, we give You thanks
for giving us another day.
Today, our Nation celebrates Flag
Day. By itself, our flag is mere fabric,
as unworthy of adoration as an idol.
But, when we recognize what the flag
represents, we realize it is a symbol
that stands for something we honor:
the better parts of our human nature,
the better parts of who we are as Amer-
icans.
When we say the Pledge of Allegiance
‘‘to the flag,’’ we are reminding our-
selves of the values it represents.
We thank You, O God, for Your inspi-
ration to our Founders and to all lead-
ers throughout our great history.
May we, in our day, be vigilant in
safeguarding the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by our constitutional gov-
ernment for all who live within our
shores, thereby justifying our rev-
erence for the Stars and Stripes.
May all that is done be for Your
greater honor and glory.
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E779

RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF SOUTH SHORE CLEAN
CITIES
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 14, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect that I take this time to congratu-
late South Shore Clean Cities, Incorporated,
as the organization celebrates its 20th anni-
versary. Through sustainable transportation
and energy efforts, South Shore Clean Cities
has enhanced the quality of life for residents
and visitors of Northwest Indiana and beyond
for the past twenty years. In recognition of this
momentous milestone, the organization will
host a celebratory banquet on June 18, 2019,
at the Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana.
South Shore Clean Cities is a member-
based, nonprofit coalition that promotes sus-
tainable transportation and energy programs in
Northern Indiana. The organization supports
initiatives that work to encourage domestic
fuels, improve air quality, strengthen the na-
tion’s energy security, reduce dependence on
imported oil, and build the local economy. Due
to the dedication and hard work of the coali-
tion’s members and leaders, South Shore
Clean Cities has won numerous awards and
received countless accolades for its contribu-
tions, and it is certainly worthy of each and
every honor.
On June 15, 1999, South Shore Clean Cit-
ies was founded as the 71st Clean Cities coa-
lition under the United States Department of
Energy. In the early years, Northern Indiana
Public Service Company (NIPSCO) provided
support for the organization to achieve non-
profit status and to be recognized by the
United States Department of Energy. Under
the initial leadership of Liz Williams and Deb
McClelland-Parker, the coalition continued to
grow, serving Lake, Porter, and LaPorte Coun-
ties in Northwest Indiana. In 2005, Carl and
Lorrie Lisek became co-coordinators of South
Shore Clean Cities. Then, in 2011, Lorrie be-
came the Executive Director of Wisconsin
Clean Cities and Carl become the Executive
Director of South Shore Clean Cities, Incor-
porated.
Throughout the years, South Shore Clean
Cities has surpassed its goals, exceeded its
expectations, and continues to progress.
Today, the coalition covers eighteen counties
and its membership has grown exponentially.
Projects spearheaded by the organization in-
clude NIPSCO’s IN-Charge Project, the BP
Cleaner Air through Diesel Emissions Reduc-
tions Grant Program, and the Green Fleet Pro-
gram. Over the past decade, South Shore
Clean Cities has helped to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions by 607,000 tons and has re-
duced the number of gasoline gallon equiva-
lents by 93 million gallons. For their truly inno-
vative and successful energy and transpor-
tation initiatives, the organization’s members
and leaders are worthy of the highest praise.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in
congratulating South Shore Clean Cities, In-
corporated, on its 20th anniversary. For the
past twenty years, the leadership and mem-
bers of the coalition have enhanced the lives
of countless individuals through their unwaver-
ing commitment to the community of North-
west Indiana and beyond, and they serve as
an inspiration to us all.

CELEBRATING THE SUCCESS OF
QTD MILITARY STYLE LEARNING
ACADEMY
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 14, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I would like
to celebrate the success of the QTD Military
Style Learning Academy in Garden Grove,
California. This year, QTD Military Style Learn-
ing Academy will be celebrating their eighth
anniversary. Each year, QTD serves thou-
sands of students through QTD Private
School, Summer Leadership Program, After-
school Program, and Worldwide Learning.
The QTD Military Academy offers over 100
academic courses and class sizes are small to
provide an interactive learning experience.
The teachers at QTD Military Academy are
committed to helping their students strive for
excellence.
Mike Tran is the Founder and CEO of QTD
International. Mr. Tran has served as a Re-
cruiter and Career Counselor for the United
States Army. He is a graduate from the Har-
vard Law School Program on Negotiation and
the Orange County Superior Court Leadership
Academy. His attention to detail and dedica-
tion to the Academy and students have cre-
ated an environment for both personal and
academic success.
QTD Military Academy’s goal is to generate
new possibilities and inspire students to act
with creativity and courage in their work. Aca-
demic excellence, knowledge, and goodness
are the core values at QTD. The Military
Academy emphasizes academic excellence by
providing students with foundations in arts, hu-
manities, mathematics, and natural sciences.
Instructors at the academy foster independent
learning, critical thinking, creative collabora-
tion, and personal well-being. Students thrive
in the creative and innovative environment
with plentiful opportunities, aid, and resources.
QTD encourages students to consider the im-
pact of their actions on the community in tan-
dem with striving to attain their personal goals.
QTD has expanded to additional locations in
Southern California with locations in Irvine and
Huntington Beach.
It is my honor to congratulate Mike Tran and
the QTD Military Style Learning Academy on
their eighth year of success and their contin-
ued contributions to the community of Orange
County.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF BELL’S SHORT
STOP
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 14, 2019
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise in
recognition of Wilbur Bell on the occasion of
the 50th anniversary of Mr. Bell’s business,
Bell’s Short Stop.
Opened in 1969, Bell’s Short Stop has
grown into a community staple. Thanks to Mr.
Bell’s business savvy and dedication to the
tight-knit West Perrine community, Bell’s Short
Stop has expanded to include Flavas, a soul
food staple that attracts not only locals but
also Florida politicians and visiting NFL play-
ers. Mr. Bell’s businesses have played an inte-
gral role in the lives of the families of West
Perrine, bringing supplies and services as well
as community spirit to the neighborhood.
Mr. Bell is also a local celebrity, West
Perrine’s first elected official as former Chair
of the Miami-Dade County Community Coun-
cil. Prior to this position, he studied at Florida
Agricultural and Mechanical University and
served in Vietnam, for which he received a
Vietnam Service Medal. He is also a licensed
real estate broker and member of Midtown
Realty’s Millionaire Club.
Mr Bell’s business has become a family af-
fair. Three of his children worked at Bell’s
Short Stop, and one son currently runs Flavas.
But more than that, Mr. Bell treats his cus-
tomers as though they are family.
I am truly inspired by Wilbur Bell’s passion
for giving back to the West Perrine commu-
nity, his dedication to his business and to his
