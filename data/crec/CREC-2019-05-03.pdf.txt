You require us to be faithful to our
commitments, to Your command-

May Your forgiveness free us to love

May all that is done this day be for

RECOGNIZING CINCO DE MAYO
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the holiday of Cinco de
Mayo commemorating the victory of the Mexi-
can Army 1862 over France at the Battle of
Puebla during the Franco-Mexican War.
The fifth day of May, or Cinco de Mayo, is
a special day because it represents the impor-
tance of freedom, liberty and determination for
the people of Mexico and for Mexican-Ameri-
cans.
It was on that day, May 5, 1862, that un-
trained, outnumbered, and outgunned Mexican
forces—determined to protect their land—suc-
cessfully defended the town of Puebla against
the French.
The quest for an independent Mexico start-
ed on September 16, 1810, when the people
of Mexico, following the will to become a free
nation, refused to submit to Spanish rule.
The struggle went on for 10 years.
Finally, in 1821, the first independent Mexi-
can government was established.
But being an independent nation was not
easy.
Over the years, Mexico received economic
support from several nations, France and Eng-
land among them.
Later on, even Spain supported the new
country.
Thus, Mexico became heavily indebted to
foreign powers.
Due to ongoing political unrest caused by
many groups struggling for power, Mexico was
not able to pay back the loans.
On July 17, 1861, President Benito Juarez
issued a moratorium in which all-foreign debt
payments would be suspended for a period of
two years, with the promise that after this pe-
riod, payments would resume.
In 1862, France, Spain, and England dis-
patched their fleets to Mexican shores pur-
suing not only money but also land rights as
payment for their loans.
A government representative greeted them
and explained that Mexico acknowledged its
debts but had no funds to pay them.
They were offered payment warrants in ex-
change.
The Spaniards and the British decided to
accept the warrants and withdrew from the
scene.
But the French government’s representative
did not accept the offer and ordered his troops
to invade the country and head toward Mexico
City, the nation’s capital.
They had to cross through the state of
Puebla to get to the capital.
Mexican President Benito Juarez reacted
immediately and prepared the defense.
He commanded Ignacio Zaragoza, a young
and brave General, to fortify the City of Puebla
and repel the French invaders.
The battle was by no means even.
France, under Louis Napoleon’s rule, had
the world’s most powerful army, and sent
more than six thousand men to invade Mex-
ico.
But the courage and the love of freedom im-
pelled the Mexican people to fight back.
General Ignacio Zaragoza led 5,000 ill-
equipped Mestizo and Zapotec Indians called
Zacapoaxtlas.
On the 5th of May 1862, the forts of Loreto
and Guadalupe, in the city of Puebla, became
the scene of the historic defeat of the great
army of France.
Against overwhelming odds, they managed
to drive the enemy back, achieving a total vic-
tory over the best trained and equipped sol-
diers in the world and ending the era of Euro-
pean domination of the Americas.
For Mexico, this day has come to represent
a symbol of Mexican unity.
In the United States, Cinco de Mayo is also
a celebration of the rich cultural heritage Mexi-
can Americans have brought to the United
States.
Hispanics are the fastest growing minority
group in the United States.
According to the most recent data available,
the estimated Hispanic population in the U.S.
is 57.5 million—constituting 17.8 percent of
our nation’s population.
Hispanics now own a record number of
small businesses—1.6 million, with annual rev-
enues of more than $221 billion.
Small businesses create two-thirds of Amer-
ican jobs, and the fastest-growing small busi-
ness sector is Latino-owned firms.
Today, there are 40 Hispanic Members in
the United States Congress, including 4 Sen-
ators and 36 House Members, many of whom
are Mexican-American, representing constitu-
encies in all regions of the country, from Cali-
fornia to New York, from Arizona to Illinois,
from Colorado to Florida.
These gains and numbers tell us that His-
panics are a driving force in our country—eco-
nomically, socially and politically.
Hispanics share the common goals with all
other Americans of freedom, opportunity, and
a chance to build a better life.
In pursuing these aspirations, Hispanics
have made important contributions to life in
the United States in the fields of culture,
sports, entertainment, business enterprise,
science, politics and others.
Today, millions of Americans will join our
neighbors to the south in celebrating Cinco de
Mayo.
On this day, we are reminded that all peo-
ple—regardless of their race, color, or gen-
der—have enriched cultures and are worthy of
respect and self-determination.
I am happy to be here today to celebrate
this momentous day and to recognize the val-
ues, traditions, and positive contributions of
the Mexican culture.
HONORING ORANGE COUNTY PO-
LITICAL LEGEND FRANK
BARBARO
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I would like
to honor Frank Barbaro, of Orange County, a
prominent attorney, humanitarian and a polit-
ical legend. Mr. Barbaro passed away on April
15th.
Born in Detroit, Michigan of Italian-English-
Irish parents and raised by his mother and
grandmother, the family, arrived in Orange
County in 1954, exactly 65 years ago, settling
in the City of Garden Grove.
After attending Garden Grove High School,
Mr. Barbaro attended the University of South-
ern California and graduated Magna Cum
Laude with his Bachelor of Arts in Political
Science in June of 1965. In June of 1965, Mr.
Barbaro was accepted to law school at the
University of Southern California and grad-
uated in 1968. During law school, Mr. Barbaro
was awarded the Warner Trust Grant, he was
a Bauer Fellow and received the Legion Lex
Scholarship.
During college Mr. Barbaro worked as a life-
guard at the Disneyland Hotel and the Balboa
Bay Club and later worked as ‘‘Fearless
Frank’’ on the Disneyland Jungle Cruise as a
skipper/narrator. Mr. Barbaro was Walt

In 1977, Mr. Barbaro was one of the found-
ing partners of Horton, Barbaro & Reilly and
practiced as a partner until its dissolution in
2005. Mr. Barbaro has practiced in all areas of
civil litigation. Mr. Barbaro has been involved
in many high-profile cases including rep-
resenting the 23,000 investors in Lincoln Sav-
ings against Charles Keating and victims of
the MGM Grand Hotel Fire in Las Vegas.
Taking over from Richard J. O’Neill, Mr.
Barbaro initially chaired the Democratic Party
in 1977–78 at the ripe old age of 34. During
these two years Mr. Barbaro ran a registration
campaign for voters that resulted in a Demo-
cratic majority in Orange County for the only
time in modern history. Mr. Barbaro was also
responsible for the creation of the Democratic
Foundation of Orange County.
Mr. Barbaro has served in many positions
with the Democratic Party of Orange County
or the Democratic Foundation of Orange
County. He returned to the role of Chairman of
the DPOC from 2003 until 2013, becoming the
longest serving chair in the DPOC’s history.
During that time, Mr. Barbaro invested his own
money to bring in a professional staff and set
the foundation that would lead to the Orange
County ‘‘Blue Wave’’ of 2018.
Mr. Barbaro was named chair to the Orange
County campaigns of many prominent elected
officials, including President Barack Obama,

IN MEMORY OF REVEREND
JASPER R. BROWN, SR.
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today, to pay tribute to a
man of God, respected public servant, and
dear friend of longstanding, Reverend Jasper
R. Brown, Sr. Sadly, Reverend Brown
transitioned from labor to reward on Wednes-
day, April 24, 2019. His funeral service will be
held at 3 pm on Sunday, May 5, 2019, at Live
Oak A.M.E. Church in Donalsonville, Georgia.
Rev. Jasper Ross Brown, Sr. was born in
Malone, Florida on September 17, 1925, to
the union of Reverend David Rufus Brown and
Mrs. Torah Bowers Brown. The values of
Christian discipleship and hard work were in-
stilled in Jasper at a young age. After com-
pleting primary school in the Jackson County,
Florida Public School System, he began work-
ing under his father and developed the dis-
cipline, work ethic, and joy that came with
farming and being exposed to the Gospel. Be-
cause manhood was thrust upon him at an
early age, he only finished eighth grade, but
was an avid reader, highly intelligent, and had
a love for learning. Hence, as an adult, while
working full-time at Great Southern Plywood
Mill in Cedar Springs, Georgia, and supporting
his family, he went back to school taking high
school classes in Tallahassee, Florida and
earned his GED.
Jasper Brown answered the call to serve his
nation at the age of 18, becoming the first Afri-
can-American from Seminole County, Georgia
to be inducted into the United State Marine
Corps. He was trained as a member of the
historic Montford Point Marines and fought in
the gruesome Battle of Peleliu in Japan during
World War II. More than 50 years later, he
and all of the Montford Point Marines, the first
African-Americans allowed to serve in the Ma-
rine Corps, were awarded the Congressional
Gold Medal by President Barack Obama rec-
ognizing their personal sacrifice and service to
their country during World War II.
When Jasper Brown returned home from
World War II, within a few days of his return,
he met and shortly thereafter married Ruby
Moore Brown, a union which lasted for 53
years until Ruby’s death in May, 2001. Japser
and Ruby had 10 children, seven of whom
predeceased them.
A man of many trades, he explored the
realm of real estate in the Donalsonville area
before taking classes to obtain his GED. Dur-
ing this time, he used his voice to help im-
prove the working conditions for the employ-
ees at the Great Southern Plywoood Mill in
Cedar Springs, Georgia, where he helped or-
ganize and form a union to protect employees’
rights to a fair wage, fair pensions, insurance,
and overall fair treatment. He mentored others
and was often a voice for the voiceless and
was never reluctant to challenge injustice in
the workplace or anywhere people sought his
help for unfair treatment. He was elected and
served honorably as the first Black City Coun-
cilman in the City of Donalsonville, Georgia.
In October 1977, Jasper Brown accepted
his calling into the ministry to preach the word
of God, and for 30 years, he pastored in the
African Methodist Episcopal Church under the
jurisdiction of the South and Southwest Geor-
gia Conferences.
His pastoral ministry included Whigham Cir-
cuit & Little Bethel A.M.E. Church, South
Georgia Conference; Hilton Circuit, Southwest
Georgia Conference; Newberry A.M.E.
Church, Southwest Georgia Conference;
Payne Chapel A.M.E. Church, Southwest
Georgia Conference; Aimwell A.M.E. Church,
Southwest Georgia Conference; and Brown
Chapel A.M.E. Church, Southwest Georgia
Conference. After briefly retiring to rediscover
his love of farming, Rev. Brown was called
back to the church and assigned to Ebenezer
A.M.E. Church, Hilton, where he pastored for
another four years before completely retiring in
December, 2011.
On a personal note, I am proud to have
considered Rev. Jasper Brown, his late wife,
Ruby Moore Brown, and the entire Brown and
Moore Families as friends of longstanding.
Their daughter, Alice, interned at the Georgia
General Assembly while I was serving in the
State House and she was a student at the
University of Georgia. Through her, I eventu-
ally met the family, as attorney for her mother,
the sister of the renowned Dr. Dallas Moore.
Mrs. Ruby Brown had been seriously injured
in a motor vehicle crash in Seminole County.
My relationship with the Brown and Moore
families has endured for over 3 decades and
has been pivotal in my career and political
success. I will be forever grateful for their
friendship and support.
Rev. Brown accomplished much in his life,
but none of it would have been possible with-
out the Grace of God and the love and sup-
port of his family as well as the countless oth-
ers who impacted his life. His passing leaves
a tremendous void in the lives of his children:
Jasper, Jr., Derrell, Alice, Kendra, Deborah,
Angela, Annette, and Anthony; brother, Virgil;
sixteen grandchildren; nine great-grand-
children; nieces, nephews, cousins; personal
assistant, Ms. France Land; friend and com-
panion, Ms. Petronia ‘‘Sweet’’ Mike; and
countless other family and friends; all of whom
will miss him deeply.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than
730,000 people of Georgia’s Second Congres-
sional District, in honoring the life and legacy
of the Reverend Jasper R. Brown, Sr. for his
outstanding accomplishments in the ministry
and his service to humankind. Moreover, we
extend our deepest sympathies to Reverend
Brown’s family, friends, loved ones, and all
who grieve during this difficult time of bereave-
ment. We pray that they will be consoled and
comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy
Spirit in the weeks, months, and years ahead.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOANNE
HAYES-WHITE
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Joanne Hayes-White as she responds
to her final call as Chief of the San Francisco
Fire Department. Chief Hayes-White will be re-
tiring after 29 years with the department. Hers
is a long and storied career that spans the
transformation of the department from an all-
male bastion to a modern department in which
merit is measured by your capacity to save
lives and property through working as part of
a team, and celebrating the differences that
make this nation great.
Joanne Hayes-White was born in San Fran-
cisco. She graduated from the University of
Santa Clara with a degree in business and im-
mediately applied to the San Francisco Fire
Department. She was hired in April of 1990.
She climbed the career ladder almost as
quickly as the ladder on a truck. In 1993 she
was promoted to Lieutenant and in 1996 to
Captain. Also in 1996, she was assigned as
the Acting Battalion Chief with oversight of the
department’s dispatch and communications
systems. The department selected Battalion
Chief Hayes-White to oversee the installation
of the Computer-Aided Dispatch system (CAD)
and the Automated Information System (AIS).
Along the way, Chief Hayes-White combined
the communications functions of police, fire,
and emergency response, improving response
times and inter-agency communications.
Firefighters live and die based in part on
their training. As Director of Training, Joanne
Hayes-White developed the Battalion-Based In
Service Training Program which almost tripled
the number of formal training hours for all
members of the department, with almost no
fiscal impact. As Chief, she has implemented
random on-duty alcohol and drug testing,
reconfigured emergency medical services, and
restored promotional exams, all steps that
have increased accountability within the de-
partment.
The fire department is noticeable in the
community through the training of civilians and
even school children. Ninth graders in San
Francisco learn CPR. The department is com-
mitted to reducing pedestrian deaths and
works to right-size equipment to San Fran-
cisco’s streets.
In April of 2010, the Chief was offered a fel-
lowship to attend the Harvard Kennedy School
Senior Executives in State and Local Govern-
ment Program. It was an investment in excel-
lence, as evidence a few years later. In Au-
gust 2018, Chief Hayes-White was named as
the 2018 Career Fire Chief of the Year by the
International Association of Fire Chiefs.
San Francisco is a complex city to protect.
The department’s personnel are famous for
valor and for protecting the forty-nine square
miles of dense community that constitutes the
city. The fire department goes beyond fighting
fires and preventing death and injury due to
medical emergencies. Under Chief Hayes-
White’s leadership, the department was a
leader in environmental and sustainability ini-
tiatives, such as transitioning the fleet to re-
newable diesel, composting and recycling.
It has been a privilege to work with Joanne
Hayes-White during my time in the State Leg-
islature and in Congress and to call her a dear
friend. She is an inspiration to girls and young
women throughout San Francisco. She has at-
tended multiple of my When I Grow Up events
and spoke before 600 girls and family mem-
bers at Grenentech. During her remarks, she
noted that it was not easy to make her way in
the 1990’s-era department. The department
only began hiring women in 1987. As of 2017,
30 years later, 15% of firefighters were
women. Yet the department is also a close-
knit community. Even as Chief, she knows
every firefighter by name.
As a human being, Joanne Hayes-White ex-
cels. Her ready smile, respect for traditions
that strengthen the department, and love of
community are second to none. She is a na-
tive of San Francisco’s winding streets, fog-
shrouded hills and beautiful beaches. She has
managed the department when its budget was
cut and fought hard to get positions and capa-
bilities restored as the economy recovered.
We are all safer because Chief Hayes-White
assumed the helm of the San Francisco Fire
Department.
Now, it’s time for Joanne to take time to
smell the roses. She will see more of her sons
Riley, age 25, Logan, age 21, and Sean, age
19. They grew up with the department with
her, and now they get to reclaim some of the
time she offered to the city by the bay.
For those of us who have lived in and
grown up around San Francisco, there are two
bells that immediately trigger an image of the
city that we love: Cable car bells and the bell
at the fire house as another rescue com-
mences. San Franciscans are proud of both.
For 29 years, they’ve had Chief Hayes-White
to respond to the fire house bell. Sláinte
mhaith, Chief Hayes-White. We are all deeply
grateful for a job so well done.

TRIBUTE TO THE HONOR FLIGHT
OF MIDDLE TENNESSEE
HON. JOHN W. ROSE
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize the 27 veterans
from Tennessee who visited Washington,
D.C., on May 1, 2019, with Honor Flight of
Middle Tennessee. On behalf of a grateful
state and nation, I was honored to welcome
these heroes to our nation’s capital.
As a new Member of Congress, this marked
the first time I have had the privilege of meet-
ing with an Honor Flight from Tennessee. I
was pleased to welcome several veterans on
this flight who were from the district I rep-
resent, the Sixth District of Tennessee. They
were: Earl E. Higley, U.S. Army; Jimmie M.
Pritt, U.S. Air Force; Glenn Wade Bennett,
U.S. Army; John Anthony Jones, U.S. Army;
Billy R. McElhaney, U.S. Navy; C. M. Tosh,

U.S. Marine Corps; Danny Ray Sisk, U.S. Air
Force; Robert Ernest Tapscott, U.S. Army;
and Curtis W. Posey, U.S. Army.
Madam Speaker, the men and women from
Honor Flight of Middle Tennessee exemplify
the greatness of the United States. Though we
can never fully repay them for their service to
our country, it was my privilege to offer our
most sincere gratitude for the sacrifices they
made on behalf of the Sixth District of Ten-
nessee.
I would also like to extend a special ‘‘thank
you’’ to the local communities and volunteers
who worked together to make this special visit
possible. I would especially like to thank
Claude Morse (USAF Ret.), the President and
Chairman of the Board for Honor Flight of Mid-
dle Tennessee, for his tireless work organizing
this event. Without this team, the Honor Flight
would not have been possible.
To my colleagues here today, I hope you
will join me in thanking these veterans and
their families for their dedication and service to
our country.

HONORING LIFETIME ACHIEVE-
MENTS OF CHARLOTTE EGAN
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I would like
to honor the achievements of one of my con-
stituents, Charlotte Egan, who is celebrating
her 50th year of service for the OC Health
Care Agency and her well-deserved retire-
ment.
Mrs. Egan began her career at the OC
Health Care Agency as a Public Health Micro-
biologist Trainee in 1969, after seeing an ad
for the opening in a newspaper. Since then,
she has worked her way through every section
of the HCA laboratory. In 1985, she was pro-
moted to Public Health Microbiologist II in the
Virology/Serology section where she served
as the lead microbiologist. Mrs. Egan has
played an instrumental role in the research
and identification of viruses such as Influenza,
Mumps, Chicken Pox, and Rubella. She has
also been at the forefront of combatting out-
breaks of HIV, H1N1 Influenza, and Measles.
Charlotte is known for the quality and standard
of her work. She served as an outstanding
model to her trainees and peers. In the words
of Mrs. Egan, ‘‘Find work that you’re pas-
sionate about and do it well. Serve your com-
munity with patience and have respect for pa-
tients.’’
Today we celebrate not only her decades-
long career, but her future beyond the labora-
tory. She looks forward to spending more time
with her granddaughters, volunteering at the
Hollywood Braille Institute and the Aquarium
of the Pacific, traveling, and maybe even pur-
suing her dream of qualifying for a mission to
the International Space Station.
Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize
Mrs. Charlotte Egan for her commitment to ex-
cellence and dedication to serving our commu-
nity.
HONORING CAPTAIN PAUL
WHITESCARVER, UNITED STATES
NAVY
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Captain Paul A. Whitescarver,
who retires this week from a nearly 40-year
career of service to our nation in the United
States Navy.
Captain Whitescarver has served as the
51st Commanding Officer of our nation’s ‘‘first
and finest’’ submarine base, Naval Submarine
Base New London since December 2015. His
leadership at the base will without question
have a lasting impact on its operations and
readiness for years to come. In his three and
a half years as its Commander, he oversaw
several significant environmental and energy
upgrades which have helped to continue mod-
ernization of the facility, including innovative
microgrid and fuel cell projects leveraging
homegrown Connecticut technology to provide
standalone power to the base. This effort was
so successful that the Department of Energy
recognized it with a 2018 Federal Energy and
Water Management award.
Another tremendous accomplishment under
his tenure was the completion of Superfund
site cleanup. It is great to see the resolution
of this significant undertaking which was rec-
ognized by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA). Captain Whitescarver’s leader-
ship throughout this process has shown his
drive to go above and beyond to improve the
base.
Captain Whitescarver has substantially
raised the military value of the base with his
work and proven its enduring mission well into
the future. He laid the groundwork for the fu-
ture expansion of pier capacity as our sub-
marine fleet continues to modernize and grow
towards its overall goal of 66 attack sub-
marines. He spearheaded the pier 32 project
for which we are now seeing funding in this
year’s defense budget and expect it to be
funded by Congress so that the project can
commence on time. Many of the new boats
constructed in the coming years will be sta-
tioned in Groton, and without Captain
Whitescarver’s efforts, the base would not be
as prepared to accept them as it will be once
these projects are completed.
At the same time, it is important to recog-
nize that Captain Whitescarver’s impact ex-
tends beyond the base, reaching the citizens
and businesses in the surrounding community.
He oversaw Connecticut’s Submarine Century,
the yearlong celebration of the 100th anniver-
sary of the submarine force in 2015 and 2016,
demonstrating strong support in his consistent
participation at events and collaboration with
local officials. He projected a positive image
for the Navy in a critical time for recruitment
and promotion of our military and particularly
our submarine force. As if he did not have
enough to do, he also managed the celebra-
tion of the 150th anniversary of the establish-
ment of the Navy installation which would
eventually become Submarine Base New Lon-
don. This milestone underscores how the base
has effectively adapted over time to meet the
needs of the Navy, and we thank Captain
Whitescarver for his role in ensuring the base
continues to be equipped to handle our future
needs as well.
A particular highlight of mine working with
Captain Whitescarver over the last few years
was his April 2018 engagement at Asnuntuck
Community College in Enfield, which he him-
self attended in 1989. His presence and
poignant words to students, faculty, and staff
reinforced the belief that our community col-
leges are stepping stones to any number of
highly successful careers.
Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to
join me in honoring Captain Whitescarver, and
his wife Katie, for their service to our nation
and in wishing them ‘fair winds and following
seas’ as they move on to their next steps.

TRIBUTE TO YOUNG STAFF MEM-
BERS FOR THEIR CONTRIBU-
TIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PEO-
PLE OF THE 18TH CONGRES-
SIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS AND
THE UNITED STATES
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as
Members of Congress we know well, perhaps
better than most how blessed our nation is to
have in reserve such exceptional young men
and women who will go on to become leaders
in their local communities, states, and the na-
tion in the areas of business, education, gov-
ernment, philanthropy, the arts and culture,
and the military.
We know this because we see them and
benefit from their contributions every day.
Many of them work for us in our offices as jun-
ior staff members, congressional fellows, or in-
terns and they do amazing work for and on
behalf of the constituents we are privileged to
represent.
Madam Speaker, I believe there is no higher
calling than the call to serve a cause larger
than ourselves. That is why I ran for public of-
fice. I was inspired to serve by President Ken-
nedy who said, ‘‘Ask not what your country
can do for you, ask what you can do for your
country,’’ and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. who said:
Everybody can be great because anybody
can serve. . . . You only need a heart full of
grace. A soul generated by love.
By this measure, there are several other
great young men and women who served as
volunteers this year in my offices. They may
toil in obscurity but their contributions to the
constituents we serve are deeply appreciated.
That is why today I rise to pay tribute to 8 ex-
traordinary young persons for their service to
my constituents in the 18th Congressional Dis-
trict of Texas and to the American people.
They are: Makaila Davenport, Hampton Uni-
versity; Jaida Hampton, University of Ken-
tucky; Jacqueline Olvera, Texas A&M Univer-
sity; Syeda-Asma Mudassar, University of San
Francisco; Ivy Smith, Oberlin College; Kali

IN RECOGNITION OF SISTER
SUZANNE TOOLAN
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Sister Suzanne Toolan, a longtime force
for education and social justice within my dis-
trict. She is being honored by her friends with
the Catherine McAuley Award for her dedica-
tion to the education of young women. I join
in their joy and celebration of her decades in
service.
I first met Sister Suzanne while a student at
Mercy Burlingame. She taught chorale, a sub-
ject for which I was singularly unqualified.
However, as my fellow students noted, Sister
Suzanne was a patient and inspiring teacher.
The Mercy choir is known throughout the San
Francisco Peninsula for its inspiring repertoire
and joyful music, particularly during Christmas
and other holidays. Sister Suzanne was the
heart and soul of a generation of choral sing-
ers, providing spiritual and contemporary
pieces for the girls to perform.
Her role in chorale, and the impact that she
had on students, was only one measure of her
long career. Sister Suzanne is the composer
of the hymn entitled, ‘‘I Am the Bread of Life,’’
a deeply moving piece that inspires Catholic
and other Christian congregations around the
globe. Sister put the words of Jesus to music
in 1964 during her free period between two
classes. The San Francisco Archdiocese was
to hold an event and Sister wished to con-
tribute.
As she later stated, she didn’t initially like
her work so when the bell rang for her to go
back to class she ripped up the song and
tossed it into the wastebasket. A student, who
was nearby, came out of the infirmary and
said, ‘‘What was that? It was beautiful!’’ So,
Sister retrieved the song, scotch taped it to-
gether, and submitted it.
It may be irreverent to say so, but in Janu-
ary of 1964 the Beatles song ‘‘I Want To Hold
Your Hand’’ hit No. 1 on the Billboard Top 100
Chart. However, for many of us, that song
couldn’t hold a candle to Sister Suzanne’s ‘‘I
Am the Bread of Life.’’ The church has its rel-
ics, but in this instance the workpiece of the
Beatles is the relic and that of Sister Suzanne
is a perpetually inspiring song, translated into
at least 20 languages, that reminds us of the
everlasting. For her work, Sister Suzanne was
called an ‘‘Icon of the Second Vatican Coun-
cil’’ and received the Benedictus Award from
the Liturgical Commission of the Diocese of
San Jose, presented by Bishop Patrick
McGrath, in 2016.
As noted by her supporters and friends, Sis-
ter Suzanne is also the author of a book enti-
tled Canticles and Gathering Prayers, a com-
posite of services and canticles written for
groups gathered in prayer. Her work allowed
Catholics to understand their faith in the
vernacular, making faith more accessible.
Sister Suzanne is immensely well educated.
She holds a master’s degree in humanities
and a second master’s degree from San Fran-
cisco State University. She did compositional
work at Michigan State University, liturgical
study at the University of Notre Dame, and
choral work with Robert Shaw at San Diego
State University. She introduced Taize Prayer
and worship to the West Coast in 1983. After
her stellar career at Mercy Burlingame, Sister
Suzanne founded Catherine’s Center, a transi-
tional house for women released from prison.
It is a ministry of the St. Vincent de Paul Soci-
ety of San Mateo County.
I recently viewed a photo of Sister Suzanne
during her era as a Mercy Burlingame teacher.
She was swinging her baton and had a smile
from ear to ear. Music has the power to in-
spire us to great deeds. Sister Suzanne con-
veyed that power in overwhelming force to im-
pressionable minds seeking the knowledge of
math, science, literature, and leadership.
These are core subjects at Mercy Burlingame,
and core subjects of any young woman seek-
ing to come into her own as a young adult.
Sister Suzanne never let them down. I know
because I was one of those young women
who was captivated by Sister Suzanne’s pow-
erful spirituality and joyful musical grace.
As we reflect upon her life, I cannot offer
her a musical analogy to illustrate her impact
upon her students and the world. However, I
can offer an historical allusion that I believe is
apt. When Churchill spoke from the floor dur-
ing times of grave crisis, Parliament was
roused to act and the course of western civili-
zation was sharply and famously revised. We
know that the music of Sister Suzanne Toolan,
both famous and less so, inspires millions.
She has never held high office in civic life but
instead chose to announce the glory of the
highest office that any of us may attain. Who
can doubt that her accomplishments will
shape our civilization for hundreds of years to
come.

COMMEMORATING THE ONE HUN-
DREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
ELMIRA KIWANIS CLUB
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the one hundredth anniversary
of the Elmira Kiwanis Club.
The Kiwanis Club of Elmira is a branch of
Kiwanis International, a global volunteer orga-
nization dedicated to bettering the world
through their communities and the children in
them. Over their century-long history, the El-
mira Kiwanis have had more than ten thou-
sand local residents join them in serving their
community, providing over one million hours of
community service.
In their mission to better their community,
the Elmira Kiwanians have partnered with a
variety of local organizations. They have lent
their support to groups such as the YMCA, the
Arctic League, Food Bank of the Southern
Tier, the Red Cross, and the Salvation Army,
providing service or financial support to help
make their community a better place to live.
Over the last one hundred years, the Kiwanis
Club of Elmira has donated more than five
hundred thousand dollars to community
groups and organizations.
The Elmira Kiwanis Club has been dedi-
cated to helping children both at home and
abroad. Elmira students have felt their support
as the Elmira Kiwanis Club has backed pro-
grams such as the Terrific Kids and B.U.G.S
(Bringing up grades) programs. Elmira
Kiwanians recognize the potential of grad-
uating high school seniors by awarding schol-
arships. To support children abroad, members
have joined with Kiwanis International projects
to benefit UNICEF.
Most recently the Elmira Kiwanis Club es-
tablished the Hometown Heroes Banner pro-
gram, proudly recognizing military service of
more than two hundred twenty-five local men
and women who have served our country and
fought for our freedoms.
One hundred years of service in the com-
munity is certainly a cause for celebration. I
congratulate the Elmira Kiwanis Club on this
impressive milestone and look forward to their
continued success in the years to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of
the Elmira Kiwanis Club.

IN RECOGNITION OF ANNA DIAZ-
WHITE
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Anna Diaz-White as she is
honored by 180 Turning Lives Around at their
annual celebration on May 3, 2019. Ms. Diaz-
White’s exemplary leadership and contribu-
tions to 180 Turning Lives Around are truly de-
serving of this body’s recognition.
For over 40 years, 180 Turning Lives
Around has provided a safe outlet for victims
of domestic and sexual violence, providing
shelter, resources, counseling, and advocacy.
The support that the agency provides to the
community is truly immeasurable and Ms.
Diaz-White’s 35 years of service at 180 Turn-
ing Lives Around are indicative of her dedica-
tion to the agency and the care of the individ-
uals and families they serve.
Joining 180 Turning Lives Around in 1985,
Anna Diaz-White brought her experience from
the financial sector to the non-profit in her role
as Fiscal/Grant Administrator. Less than 10
years later, Ms. Diaz-White was unanimously
selected by the Board of Trustees to serve as
180’s Executive Director. Under her leader-
ship, the agency has grown immensely, serv-
ing over one million people and expanding its
outreach and services. Her vision and innova-
tive thinking have created new standards of
service in the field and serve as a model for
other domestic violence agencies in New Jer-
sey.
With her direction, 180 Turning Lives
Around has built one of the largest and most
inclusive domestic violence shelters in New
Jersey, engaged and educated local law en-
forcement, created the Monmouth Family Jus-
tice Center, Amanda’s Easel Creative Arts

services that have changed countless lives.
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope that my
colleagues will join me in thanking Anna Diaz-
White and 180 Turning Lives Around for their
invaluable impact on the community.

HONORING THE LIVES AND SERV-
ICE OF WALTER ‘‘SKIP’’ CAMP-
BELL AND ROY TRACHTENBERG
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today in recognition of the lives
and service of two outstanding individuals: my
constituents, Roy Trachtenberg and Walter
‘‘Skip’’ Campbell.
Skip Campbell was known as a monumental
warrior for justice who made a significant mark
on the world. Skip served his community in
the Florida Senate from 1996 to 2006, before
his election as Mayor of Coral Springs in
2014. His leadership was paramount in ensur-
ing the success and wellbeing of our commu-
nity.
A South Florida native, Roy Trachtenberg
served as an administrator in the New York
School system, where he devoted 35 years to
helping students succeed. He moved back to
Florida where he served as the Dean of Edu-
cation for a community college trade school,
where he developed a curriculum to upgrade
the skills of workers displaced due to the 9/11
terrorist attack.
Through their public service, each honoree
has touched countless lives and made a last-
ing impact on our South Florida community. In
recognition of this service, the Coral Spring/
Parkland Democratic Club have honored their
memories by designating their annual service
and leadership awards as the Roy
Trachtenberg Service Award and the Skip
Campbell Leadership Award.
Skip and Roy are truly deserving of this
honor. I am glad to see their legacies of serv-
ice preserved and used as a paradigm for
those who follow them.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Nathan Edgerton as he re-
ceives the North Texas in DC Internship Pro-
gram Legacy Award.
The NTDC Program connects University of
North Texas students with internship opportu-
nities in our nation’s capital. Nathan began his
long career in public service as an intern in
my Washington, D.C. office. Since then, he
has spent more than a decade helping gov-
ernment and nonprofit organizations with stra-
tegic planning, grants, and community re-
source management.
Currently, Nathan serves as a Bureau Plan-
ner for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at
the Department of State. In this role, he man-
ages the foreign assistance budget planning
and justification process for the department’s
$7 billion budget that includes economic, mul-
tilateral, law enforcement, and security assist-
ance programs that support U.S. foreign policy
objectives and interests throughout the Middle
East and North Africa. He previously served
as a Grants Management Officer supporting
economic and public diplomacy programs in
NEA and the Bureau of South and Central
Asian Affairs.
Additionally, Nathan served North Texans
as the Director of Health Grants at the United
Way of Metropolitan Dallas, supporting com-
munity organizations striving to improve health
outcomes for children and families in Dallas,
Collin, Rockwall, and southern Denton coun-
ties. He earned his B.A. in political science
and M.P.A. with a focus in nonprofit manage-
ment from UNT.
Throughout his career, Nathan has been
known for his expertise, dedication, and hard
work. I am grateful that the NTDC Program
connected him with my office years ago, and
I congratulate my fellow UNT alum on his
many achievements.

COMMEMORATING THE FORTIETH
ANNIVERSARY OF JOHN G. ULL-
MAN AND ASSOCIATES
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
commemorate the fortieth anniversary of John
G. Ullman and Associates, and congratulate
them on the grand opening of their new office.
In 1978, John G. Ullman set out to build a
new kind of wealth management firm that
would provide unprecedented service and sup-
port to meet all of a family’s financial needs.
Their mission is to be the guiding force that
helps their clients make dreams become re-
ality while maintaining the highest level of in-
tegrity and accountability. We are proud to say
this commendable institution is headquartered
in our hometown of Corning, New York.
John G. Ullman and Associates provides fi-
nancial planning that helps families prepare for
their future. They recognize the importance of
family and work to build close, trusting rela-
tionships on a multi-generational level. Their
unique values have led John G. Ullman and
Associates on the path of success and they
have expanded that success to branches in
Rochester, Rhinebeck, and most recently to
their new office in Big Flats, New York. We
commend their spirit of growth and the work
they do to grow the economy in our commu-
nities.
Forty years of serving in the community is
certainly a cause for celebration. I congratu-
late John G. Ullman and Associates on this
impressive milestone and look forward to their
continued success in the years to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
commemorate the fortieth anniversary of John
G. Ullman and Associates.

rank and file, and freshman; and both Repub-
licans and Democrats for almost 20 years be-
fore her passing at age 49 on April 15, 2019.
Her diligence, work ethic, and candor were an
asset to every office that was fortunate
enough to work with her, and were only
matched by her kindness toward all those with
whom she interacted.
April was a faithful steward of taxpayer dol-
lars, trusted advisor, detailed accountant, and
wise counselor. As she wheeled her briefcase
through the buildings every week, she brought
warmth, humor, and a ready smile. Thanks to
her sound advice and strong relationships, our
offices have maintained compliance with the
complex rules governing financial administra-
tion. To the institution, April was integral to the
everyday operation and overall smooth func-
tioning of the legislative body. To Members,
April was both responsive and honest in her
assessments, ensuring that their needs were
met swiftly and reliably. To countless staff,
April was the first and last point of contact on
Capitol Hill—from instructing those just starting
their careers to save appropriately and con-
duct themselves in a manner that would best
represent those they serve to advising individ-
uals leaving the Hill on retirement and compli-
ance. She continued to function as a sounding
board for staff as they progressed in their ca-
reers and served in other capacities. That she
was asked to serve so many varying districts
and Committees is a testament to her char-
acter—April was a public servant in the truest
sense of the word.
Recollections of her role in our offices would
be incomplete without acknowledging her hus-
band Tim and their three sons—Dakota, Hun-
ter, and Tucker. The boys were frequent, wel-
come additions during her office visits. We
send our deepest condolences to her family
for their loss.
It is with great sadness, but also with great
gratitude that we honor the life of April
Blankenship. It was a pleasure to have had
the opportunity to know her and an honor to
serve alongside her.

The Activation of the 492nd Attack Squadron
and the Assumption of Command ceremony
will be held on Friday, May 10th, on March Air

The introduction of the 492nd Attack Squad-
ron will provide an additional 14 instructor sen-
sor operators, 17 maintenance positions, 21
instructor pilots, and 61 positions with the
Commander, Director of Operations, and the
First Sergeant. This expansion will bring
added capabilities to March ARB, and will en-
able the Air Force Reserve Command’s Fourth
Air Force to attract and retain incredible new
talent as it fulfills its various missions in the re-
gion. The expansion sends a strong message
to our community that March ARB serves a
vital strategic role, not only for California but
also the Air Force Reserve at large.
Again, I want to welcome to the new 492nd

Reserve Base. I am continually humbled by

Ms. SÁNCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise

President of Rio Hondo College and resident
of Whittier, California. Ms. Dreyfuss is retiring
after 32 years of dedicated leadership that will
guide Rio Hondo College and its students for
years to come.
Ms. Dreyfuss began her journey with Rio
Hondo in 1987 and has held various roles at
the institution including Senior Accountant,
Controller/Business Manager, Chief Financial
Officer, and Vice President. In each of these
positions, she has built an incredible legacy of
service to the students and families of Los An-
geles County. Ms. Dreyfuss has worked tire-
lessly to expand access and affordability to
education while maintaining excellence at Rio
Hondo.
Throughout her long history of working with
students, she has always been a leader with
incredible vision, and that foresight has built
strong pathways guiding students for genera-
tions to come. Some of her many accomplish-
ments include the modernization of the Rio
Hondo campus, partnerships that have
streamlined student employment, and the con-
tinuation of the Rio Promise which gave first
time college students a second year of tuition
free enrollment. She is also Vice Chair of the
City of Whittier’s Sister City Committee and
member of the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials.
I cannot thank Ms. Dreyfuss enough for the
sincere commitment to the Rio Hondo College
community. Her passion for helping students
and families have made her an influential
leader whose accomplishments will continue
benefiting students and faculty for generations
to come. I wish Teresa a happy retirement,
and I thank her again for her service.

IN RECOGNITION OF KIM GARZA

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 3, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the achievements of Kim
Garza Turner, an outstanding North Texan. A
dedicated advocate for civic participation, Kim
selflessly serves her community in all that she
does.
As a young student at the University of
North Texas, Kim interned in my Washington,
D.C. office in 2004. This opportunity, facilitated
by UNT’s North Texas in DC Internship Pro-
gram, commenced Kim’s longstanding career
in public service. From the U.S. Capitol, Kim
was chosen as the sole intern for the West
Wing of the White House during President
George W. Bush’s 2004 re-election.
After returning to Texas to continue her
studies at UNT, she kept pursuing a career in
politics. For more than a decade, I have relied
on Kim as a leader, collaborator, and trusted
advisor. She has a proven track record of suc-
cess as a consultant and strategist.
In addition to her work in politics, Kim is ac-
tive member of her North Texas community.
She teaches Sunday school, volunteers as a
member of the Junior League of Dallas, and
recently completed her term on the Board of
Trustees for the Dallas Historical Society.
This evening, Kim will receive the NTDC
Program’s Legacy Award in recognition of her
many achievements. I am thankful that NTDC
connected Kim with my office 15 years ago,
and tonight I am glad to add my voice to this
well-deserved praise.
From Capitol Hill to the White House and
beyond, Kim has dedicated much of her life to
serving her fellow North Texans and the
American people. I congratulate my fellow
UNT alum on this honor, and look ahead to
many more years of excellence.
