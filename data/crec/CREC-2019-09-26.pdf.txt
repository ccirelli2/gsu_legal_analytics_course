RECOGNIZING FORMER
REPRESENTATIVE FRANK GUARINI
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the great generosity
and service of Frank Guarini, a former
Member of this institution.
He was born and raised in Jersey
City, New Jersey, and has served his
State and country through many nu-
merous roles: as a naval officer, a state
senator, a representative to the Gen-
eral Assembly of the United Nations,
and a Member of this House of Rep-
resentatives for seven terms.
During his years on the House Com-
mittee on Ways and Means, Frank
Guarini was a committed advocate for
education.
Since retiring from Congress, he has
remained a dedicated champion of edu-
cation and public service, donating
millions of dollars to support local uni-
versities and organizations.
He has provided funding to establish
numerous institutes, including the
Guarini Institute for Government and
Leadership at St. Peter’s University, a
nonpartisan forum that drives con-
versation about public policy and New
Jersey’s key issues.
He has donated to the New Jersey
City University to support performing
arts and scholarships designed for
interdisciplinary urban studies, plan-
ning, and development.
Most recently, Frank Guarini has an-
nounced a $10 million gift to St. Peter’s
University School of Business to ex-
pand and update the school’s estab-
lished new initiatives.
Madam Speaker, I would like to
thank Frank Guarini for his gen-
erosity, his public service, his long-
standing commitment to bolster edu-
cation, and his support for his home-
town of Jersey City. I thank Frank
Guarini.

THE OPIOID CRISIS AND THE
AICDAC GRANT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to draw
attention to an ongoing epidemic that
is plaguing most communities across
the Nation. I am talking about the
opioid crisis.
Far too many people have fallen vic-
tim to opioid abuse, and the statistics
in Pennsylvania are frightening. In the
most recent data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, it is
reported that 5,388 people died from
drug overdose in 2017, many of them
from opioid abuse.
Addiction does not discriminate. It
does not see race, gender, or socio-
economic status. There is not a com-
munity in our Nation that hasn’t been
impacted by opioid addiction in some
way.
Before my time in Congress, I spent
28 years as a therapist and rehabilita-
tion services manager. I have seen
firsthand how addiction impacts fami-
lies and our communities.
September is Recovery Month, and it
is an opportunity to increase aware-
ness and understanding of substance
abuse disorders.
To celebrate those who are helping
combat the opioid crisis and those who
are on the road to recovery, Clarion
County recently celebrated Recovery
Month by honoring first responders
who have made an impact on the com-
munity.
Together, John Greenway, Farrah
Murray, and Bridget Murray have
saved 38 lives by delivering naloxone,
the medication that counters the ef-
fects of opioid overdose.
At the award ceremony, Clarion resi-
dent Dustin Parsons told his story
about his struggle with addiction, not-
ing the help he received from the
AICDAC, the Armstrong Indiana Clar-
ion Drug and Alcohol Commission.
Dustin said: ‘‘During the last few
years of my addiction, I was in a posi-
tion where I could meet the AICDAC.
They helped me get a lot of resources.
I want to give back to the community.
I try to convince other people that
there is a way out of this.’’
The AICDAC works to prevent addic-
tion and treat those who have fallen
victim to opioid abuse, and they are
the recent recipient of a $1 million
grant from the Department of Health
and Human Services.

H7994 September 26, 2019
These funds will ensure the region
will have substance abuse prevention,
intervention, and treatment services,
especially when it comes to combating
the opioid crisis affecting our commu-
nities.
The grant is being used to expand the
commission’s Addiction Recovery Mo-
bile Outreach Team that services the
three area hospitals to provide treat-
ment and recovery 24/7.
Kami Anderson, Executive Director
of AICDAC, said: ‘‘The commission will
continue its work with county over-
dose task forces which are committed
to reducing and eliminating the num-
ber of fatal opioid overdoses in the
three-county area.’’
Recovery is incredibly important.
The care the therapists, first respond-
ers, doctors, and addiction specialists
provide can, in many cases, be the dif-
ference between life and death, but we
must not overlook the critical impor-
tance of prevention efforts.
Earlier this month, the Trump ad-
ministration announced $1.8 billion to
help States combat the opioid crisis. It
is my hope that this will be a step in
the right direction in healing and to
rid this Nation of this health crisis.

RECOGNIZING RAY O’CANTO
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor an incredible indi-
vidual, a man who is a beloved member
of the San Joaquin Valley from Fresno,
California, Mr. Ray O’Canto.
Sadly, Ray passed away 2 weeks ago
after a short battle with cancer.
He was a native of the San Joaquin
Valley, born in Visalia, and played
baseball at the College of the Sequoias
and his beloved Fresno State Bulldogs.
He also served for many years as the
voice of the Fresno State baseball
team.
In 2008, when the Bulldogs went from
the underdogs to the wonder dogs and
made their improbable run to win the
College World Series, the collegiate na-
tional championship, Ray was there
with his excitement and his enthu-
siasm that spread throughout the val-
ley.
He was also a popular media person-
ality, hosting a show that showcased
the food and history of the great San
Joaquin Valley and the incredible cor-
nucopia of products that we produce.
Those who knew Ray said he radiated
positivity and enthusiasm in every-
thing he did, and that was the case.
He loved our community, and his loss
will be felt for a very long time.
Madam Speaker, it is with great re-
spect that I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring our friend, Ray
O’Canto.
NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize National Hispanic
Heritage Month and the countless His-
panic Americans who have contributed
so much to the richness and diversity
of our Nation.
Ray O’Canto was an example, but
there are so many, many, many exam-
ples.
In my district, again in the San Joa-
quin Valley of California, the majority
of our constituents trace their origin
to Hispanic communities. Actually, in
California, it goes back to the very ori-
gins of the State, about 400 years ago.
They, in so many different ways, re-
flect the diversity and the breadth and
the width in our community and in our
Nation in business, in education, in the
military, in labor, in sports; meaning-
ful contributions, working people that
make a difference every day giving
back.
The Hispanic community throughout
our country reflects the American
story, and that is the story, I believe,
of the immigrant, immigrants past and
immigrants present, all wanting to
make a contribution and to live what
we call the American Dream. The
dream that is held near and dear by ev-
eryone throughout the world who ad-
mires and appreciates that America is
a beacon of light, and certainly it has
been for the Hispanic communities.
There are so many different individ-
uals that I could recognize in my con-
gressional district. I would like to
mention a couple of individuals that I
think reflect the temerity, the tena-
ciousness, and the willingness to give
back.
Mr. Aguilera, a first-generation im-
migrant, worked his way from being
homeless to owning his own business.
He founded the Merced Soccer Acad-
emy, a local nonprofit organization
which brings young people together to
compete and to learn from one another.
Every Monday, he hosts meetings for
community members to share in
events.
Another individual that I work with
from the California Highway Patrol is
Officer Aldo Garcia, also known as ‘‘El
Protector’’. ‘‘The Protector’’ is a com-
munity outreach officer that focuses
toward the Hispanic community. His
emphasis on education, not just law en-
forcement, has broken down barriers
for peace officers and created a more
approachable situation.
There are so many examples: Jose
Ramirez, a world champion boxer and
an Olympic competitor; Tom Flores,
two-time Superbowl championship
coach for the Oakland Raiders. The list
just goes on and on and on.
And guess what? All of these individ-
uals and their families reflect immi-
grant origins coming to live the Amer-
ican Dream.
Isn’t that really what it is all about?
I believe so.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in recognition of Na-
tional Hispanic Heritage Month and
the noteworthy accomplishments that
Hispanic Americans make throughout
our country, serving in our Armed
Forces, making the sacrifices that all
Americans make. It is what makes our
country the great country it is.
NATIONAL FAMILY MEALS MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to talk about one of my fa-
vorite topics: supper.
Growing up a farm kid in rural Kan-
sas, supper was always a great time, a
special time. As a matter of fact, most
everything I needed to ever learn, I
learned at the supper table.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask
my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing the celebration and importance
of September as National Family
Meals Month, a grassroots movement
to raise awareness of the benefits of
bringing families together around the
supper table for frequent family meals.
Family meals are at a critical inter-
section in our Nation. The will to re-
turn to the table exists, but families
need a friendly familiar voice to show
them the way.
As a physician, a husband, a father,
and now a grandfather, I can speak to
the positive impact having one or more
family meals around the table each
week can create for families and com-
munities.
I believe there are Main Street
issues, economic issues, and then there
are suppertime issues as well. It is the
issues at the dinner table we need to be
more focused on.
In my house, we traditionally have
dinner each day at 6 p.m., no excep-
tions. My wife, Laina, has an open invi-
tation policy at our dining table. Our
family and friends, whoever is over at
our house, knows they can always have
a seat, and as my dad used to say: ‘‘We
will just throw another potato in the
pot.’’ But one rule, they can’t be late.
And number two, you have to leave
your cellphone in your bedroom.
We take the time to sit down without
the day’s distractions and discuss the
issues impacting our lives and how we
can provide support to one another.
Frequent family meals create strong-
er family relationships and provide op-
portunities to connect with loved ones
and talk about your day. Eating to-
gether feeds the emotional well-being
of all family members.
With the growing influence of social
media and so many distractions, the
table is one of the safe places left
where families consistently can have a
conversation together.
It is our local grocery stores that are
helping bring families back to the
table. They work to provide busy cus-
tomers like you and me easy mealtime
solutions and to realize the health and
social benefits they contain.
b 1015
With our very trusted neighborhood
grocery stores assisting us with our
mealtime challenges, I know we can
get back to the table.
Right now, let’s each of us promise to
have more family meals and to get to-
gether at least once a week, because at
home, together, is how Kansans and

RECOGNIZING NEW BILATERAL TRADE
AGREEMENT
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to talk about the biggest
news of the week, a new story I have
yet to see the national media cover.
Yesterday, in New York City, the
President of the United States and the
Prime Minister of Japan signed a bilat-
eral trade agreement, a historic trade
agreement. It is historic because the
United States has never had a trade
agreement with Japan.
I want to, first of all, thank Prime
Minister Abe and all the Japanese for
their business. Their business is so im-
portant to Kansas agriculture, to Kan-
sas farmers, and to Kansas ranchers. I
thank the Prime Minister and his staff
for working so hard on this historic
free and reciprocal trade agreement
and for getting it done in record time.
The speed that this agreement was
done shows and proves the commit-
ment of President Trump to our agri-
cultural producers that the President
values agriculture and knows that we
feed not just our Nation but the entire
world.
As many of you already know, Japan
is the number one market for United
States beef, pork, and wheat, all very
important to Kansas farmers and
ranchers.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Prime
Minister and Mr. President for showing
their leadership.
Now, once again, I ask the Speaker of
the House to show leadership and bring
the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement to this floor. That agree-
ment is the most important issue that
this Congress can be facing. I cannot
control what the Chinese are going to
do in trade negotiations, but we can
control the USMCA trade agreement.
That is what is important to Kansans.
That is what Kansans want us working
on.

HONORING OFFICER JUAN JOSE
DIAZ
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. GOMEZ) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Officer Juan Jose
Diaz, a valuable member of the East
Los Angeles community and a lifelong
resident of California’s 34th Congres-
sional District. He was taken from us
far too early this July at the age of 24.
He was full of potential and an inspi-
ration to the people around him. His
sense of duty extended beyond his uni-
form, being deeply engrained in him
from a young age.
Growing up in Cypress Park, he had a
profound understanding of his commu-
nity and the problems they faced. He
wanted to be a police officer since he
was in preschool, the kind that young
men of color, like himself, could reach
out to for help, someone they could
trust.
Officer Diaz put his life on the line to
better his community and protect
those who call it home.
One night, as he was at a taco stand
in Lincoln Heights with his girlfriend
and her brothers, he saw a man tagging
gang graffiti on a wall nearby. Officer
Diaz took his duty to serve and protect
seriously, so even though he was not on
the clock at that particular moment,
he confronted the man and told him to
stop.
Ultimately, this man who was doing
the tagging left and returned and shot
at Officer Diaz and his friends. Even in
his last moments, this young hero, this
officer, looked out for the people
around him, helping his friends and
others escape the gunfire. But Officer
Diaz was shot and killed. You don’t see
that kind of commitment and courage
every single day.
I mourn the passing of Officer Juan
Jose Diaz with his family, his commu-
nity, and his colleagues on the force.
His legacy will live on with those who
were lucky enough to have known him
and with all the people who he inspired
by his bravery and dedication to the
people of East Los Angeles.

RECOGNIZING MUNDO LATINO ON
ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today during Hispanic Heritage Month
to recognize Mundo Latino, a Hispanic
publication originating from my dis-
trict in Omaha, Nebraska, that has had
a lasting impact on our Hispanic com-
munity for the last two decades.
Mundo Latino is a weekly newspaper
serving the local Hispanic population.
Founded by Abril Garcia, it is cele-
brating its 20th anniversary this year.
Abril was born in Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico, in 1973, and is a graduate of the
prestigious Monterrey Institute of
Technology and Higher Education, or
Tec de Monterrey.
Abril immigrated to the United
States in 1996 and invested her time
and money in the success of her very
own business, all while working mul-
tiple jobs during its inception. The goal
was to create a communication me-
dium that understood the language and
culture of the Hispanic community
and, more importantly, the needs of
immigrants residing here in the United
States.
Her degree in mass communication
studies gave her the knowledge she
needed to ensure the success of her
startup newspaper. In 1999, Mundo
Latino was born and had a distribution
of 3,000 copies per month, all while
Abril was still working as a cashier at
a local grocery store. By 2003, Mundo
Latino was printing 20,000 copies per
month, an outstanding feat for a 4-
year-old newspaper. In 2011, the success
of Abril and her staff enabled them to
start a second publication exclusively
serving the Omaha area.
Today, Mundo Latino produces four
different publications with a circula-
tion of nearly 40,000 copies a week
across the State of Nebraska and has
become a cherished voice throughout
the Latino community. Mundo Latino
is considered the main Spanish news-
paper for the Hispanic community in
Nebraska and northwest Iowa.
Through the years, Mundo Latino has
received numerous accolades, including
Small Business of the Year and Busi-
ness of the Year in Nebraska and Iowa,
the Organization Award from the Ne-
braska Latino American Commission,
and many others.
Mundo Latino exemplifies the Amer-
ican Dream. Our Nation provides us the
opportunities to work hard and pros-
per, and Abril is doing just that. Again,
I congratulate Mundo Latino and Abril
Garcia on achieving 20 years of excel-
lence in business and journalism.

HONORING LOUIS O’NEIL DORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) for 5
minutes.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the brilliant life
of Louis O’Neil Dore.
Dore was everything the Lowcountry
could ask for in a hometown hero. Born
in Beaufort in 1945, he attended More-
house College and worked three jobs to
put himself through college. After
graduating, he returned home to teach
high school and helped guide the deseg-
regation of Beaufort’s school system.
He eventually obtained his law degree
at the University of Georgia, where he
was one of only four Black Americans
in his class.
Dore was a tireless advocate for civil
rights and a champion of voting rights,
education, and improved health stand-
ards for the people of the Lowcountry.
Dore served as the legal officer for the
Beaufort-Jasper-Hampton Comprehen-
sive Health Services, fighting for the
rights of Black doctors to treat pa-
tients in Beaufort and Jasper Counties.
As chairman of the South Carolina
Board of Education, Dore worked with
leaders and legislators to pass the Edu-
cation Improvement Act of 1984, which
is considered some of the most com-
prehensive education reform legisla-
tion of its time.
Throughout the course of his life,
Dore would return home to Beaufort to
break historic ground, including be-
coming the first Black lawyer to be
named partner at a South Carolina
firm.
I know that I speak for the entire
State when I say that Louis Dore is one
of the greats, and we are honored that
he shaped our history.

H7996 September 26, 2019
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, with solemn remembrance and a
heavy heart, I rise today to honor the
life of my uncle, Colonel Joseph S.
Hice.
We knew him as Uncle Spurge. He
was a great husband, a father, a friend
to everyone who knew him, and an
amazing American patriot.
Colonel Hice was born in 1928 in Cher-
ry Log, Georgia. He attended the Uni-
versity of Georgia, where he graduated
with a degree in aeronautical engineer-
ing.
His passion for flight led him to an
amazing career in the United States
Air Force, where he served with honor
for 21 years. He was among the first jet
pilots in our Nation’s history who com-
manded the P–80, F–84, F–86, F–100, F–
104, KC–135, and B–52.
During his distinguished career, he
earned the World War II Victory Medal,
the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the
Air Force Outstanding Unit Award
with oak leaf cluster, the Air Force
Commendation Medal, the National
Defense Service Medal, and the Bronze
Star service medal.
Colonel Hice served his Nation with
great honor during both the Korean
and Vietnam wars and led the first
squadron of jet aircraft to circumnavi-
gate the globe nonstop.
During the October 1962 Cuban Mis-
sile Crisis, Colonel Hice served at Stra-
tegic Air Command headquarters at
Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska,
where he helped coordinate various
branches involved in Operation Look-
ing Glass, and he was responsible for
briefing President John Kennedy in
real time.
Following his career in the Air
Force, Colonel Hice celebrated a 20-
year career with Eastern Air Lines in
Miami, Florida, as a chief flight in-
structor. Later, he worked in real es-
tate in both south Florida and Atlanta,
Georgia, after his retirement from the
airline.
Colonel Hice was preceded in death
by his wife, Mary Phil Blankley Hice.
He is survived by his children, Joseph
Hice, Jr., Charles N. Hice, Leslie Jane
Hice Coleman; his brother, my father,
Thomas Hice; 10 grandchildren and
great-grandchildren; his many nieces
and nephews; and his beloved pup,
Louie.
Colonel Hice led an illustrious life of
great honor and marked dignity in
service and commitment to his family,
his friends, and his Nation. He will re-
ceive full military honors during a
ceremony at the Georgia National
Cemetery in Canton, Georgia, on Fri-
day, October 4, 2019—10/4/2019.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to join me in honoring this amazing
American hero, Colonel Joseph S. Hice:
Fly low and slow, and keep the doors
open. 10–4.

CONGRESS MUST ACT TO LOWER
INSULIN COSTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. RUSH) for 5 minutes.
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to address the scourge of the dia-
betes disease in lower income commu-
nities all across our Nation.
According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, over 30 million
Americans are living with the dreaded
diabetes, and many cannot properly
manage this potentially deadly disease
due to the high cost of their medica-
tion.
Insulin is a critical and necessary
treatment for those with diabetes.
Since 1996, the cost of the most fre-
quently prescribed forms of insulin has
increased from just $25 to over $250 per
bottle.
According to a 2018 Yale University
survey, one in four patients were forced
to ration their insulin due to these
skyrocketing costs, a potentially dead-
ly practice.
b 1030
No one, Madam Speaker, should ever
have to forgo or ration their lifesaving
medication, which is the very reason
why I introduced H.R. 366, the Insulin
Access for All Act.
This bill would prevent the most vul-
nerable citizens from having to choose
between taking their insulin or paying
their household bills by eliminating
the out-of-pocket costs for Medicare
and Medicaid patients.
I encourage all of my colleagues,
Madam Speaker, to join me in sup-
porting this very necessary bill.
Additionally, Madam Speaker, the
Committee on Energy and Commerce
Subcommittee on Health held a hear-
ing yesterday to begin discussions on
H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
I am a proud cosponsor of this bill. I
firmly believe that passing this piece
of legislation would be an important
step in relieving the burden of rising
pharmaceutical costs experienced by
all of our citizens. This legislation
would direct the Secretary of Health
and Human Services to negotiate fairer
prices for some of the 250 most costly
drugs, including insulin.
Madam Speaker, no American should
ever have to wonder if they can afford
the lifesaving insulin that they must
depend on. Congress must take bold ac-
tion to lower insulin costs. Lives are
depending on it.
Madam Speaker, healthcare is a
human right, and access to insulin is
righteous and just and good.

Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Eastern Han-
cock High School football team for
being one of four Indiana high schools
to win the Colts Leadership Challenge.
The Colts Leadership Challenge is a
competition that encourages high
school football teams to host blood
drives and encourages donations
throughout the summer.
Hundreds of donations are needed
each day to meet the needs of the
Versiti Blood Center of Indiana. We are
so proud of the Royals for helping to
deliver these critical, lifesaving meas-
ures.
I want to thank the Eastern Hancock
High School football team for their
outstanding service to the community
and to the State of Indiana. Well done.
RECOGNIZING BEC WICKER’S WOMEN IN
AGRICULTURE ACHIEVEMENT AWARD
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I want
to recognize Rush County resident Bec
Wicker, who was recently awarded the
Women in Agriculture Achievement
Award. The annual award recognizes
Indiana women who have contributed
significantly to the success of Indiana
agriculture.
Bec joined Wicker Farms in 1976 and
has since built a dairy milking oper-
ation, a calf and cow operation, and
produces corn, soybeans, wheat, alfalfa,
and hay.
I thank Mrs. Bec Wicker for her out-

FARMERS IN INDIANA’S SIXTH DISTRICT RECEIVE
HOOSIER HOMESTEAD AWARD
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I want

Sixth Congressional District.
The Hoosier Homestead Award is
given out by the Indiana State Depart-
ment of Agriculture to family farms
that have been farming for over 100
years, 150 years, and 200 years. I am
proud that, in my district alone, 15
family farms earned the Hoosier Home-
stead centennial award, 8 earned the
sesquicentennial award, and 4 earned
the bicentennial award.
Future generations of Hoosier farm-
ers can look up to these family farms
and know that hard work and dedica-
tion pays off.
Congratulations to all of these fami-
lies for earning the recognition as a

Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, this
weekend, I joined my fellow veterans
and Gold Star families in dedicating
the Beirut Memorial monument to
Hoosiers killed in the terrorist attack
in Beirut, Lebanon, on October 23, 1983.
As a Beirut veteran myself, I under-
stand that our first duty is to remem-
ber. I am proud that Indiana now has
our own memorial to commemorate
the Indiana servicemen who sacrificed
their lives in the name of peace, and we
will never forget:
James Baynard, USMC
Danny Estes, USMC
Michael Gorchinski, USN
Maurice Hukill, USMC
George McVicker, USN; and
Thomas Thorstad, USMC.
Madam Speaker, I will always be
faithful.
Semper fi.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOSE J.
GONZALEZ
(Mrs. NAPOLITANO asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life of Master
Sergeant Jose J. Gonzalez of La
Puenta, California, from my district,
who died on August 21 during combat
operations in Faryab province in Af-
ghanistan.
Master Sergeant Gonzalez was a
Green Beret who served with distinc-
tion in the military for 17 years and de-
ployed seven times during his career as
a marine, Army infantryman, and spe-
cial forces engineering sergeant.
He was recently assigned to the 1st
Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group,
Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.
Master Sergeant Gonzalez served
with incredible courage and bravery
and was awarded the Bronze Star
Medal with Valor, the Purple Heart
Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, Ma-
rine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and
many other high honors.
Mr. Speaker, I intend to recognize
and extend my deepest sympathy to
Master Sergeant Gonzalez’ wife, his
children, his mother, his father, fam-
ily, friends, and his fellow soldiers in
the 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces
Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.
Mr. Speaker, to the Gonzalez family,
please know that the Congress of the
United States grieves with you. The
courage, character and sacrifice that
he has made to our country will never
be forgotten.
God bless the Gonzalez family. God
bless America.
f
SUPPORT CLEAN ENERGY
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, as part of National Clean En-
ergy Week, I am grateful for clean en-
ergy and its advances in South Caro-
lina.
The success of President Donald
Trump has been the achievement of en-
ergy independence for America.
South Carolina is home to seven nu-
clear power reactors that produce 95
percent of the State’s emission-free
electricity. In addition, nuclear energy
facilities in South Carolina employ
over 2,800 South Carolinians. Nuclear
energy is a reliable source, providing
over half of the State’s electricity.
Solar energy is also a reliable form of
clean energy. Currently, there is
enough solar installed in South Caro-
lina to power over 90,000 homes.
I have been impressed by visiting Cy-
press Creek Renewables, a solar farm
in Gaston-Swansea, Lexington County,
welcomed by Wannelle Lefkowitz;
NARENCO solar farm in Orangeburg
County, welcomed by Michael Cox; and
Green Energy Biofuel in Aiken County,
reprocessing cooking oil, welcomed by
Joe Renwick; along with Ameresco,
clearing woody debris at the Savannah
River Site.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
NEGOTIATED DRUG PRICING
SHOULD BE ENACTED NOW
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, this week, the Committee on
Ways and Means released a report high-
lighting the disparities between the
cost of prescription drugs in the United
States and other developed nations.
This report found that on average,
drug prices in the United States were
nearly four times higher than prices in
similar countries.
The sky-high cost of prescription
drugs affects all of our communities,
and too many Americans cannot afford
the medications they need. The Medi-
care Program alone last year spent $135
for prescription drugs.
It is a lot of money, but it is also a
lot of leverage, a lot of leverage that
should be used to negotiate lower drug
prices for Medicare and for the Amer-
ican people.
Negotiated drug pricing should be en-
acted now.
f
NATIONAL LITERACY MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
September as National Literacy
Month.
Reading is a fundamental part of
learning and expanding our knowledge
of the world around us. It is especially
important to form strong reading hab-
its in childhood that we can carry with
us throughout our adult lives.
Parents, educators, and the local
community can all play a role in en-
couraging young people to pick up a
book and to exercise their imagina-
tions.
A great resource that schools, muse-
ums, and public libraries can take ad-
vantage of is the Library of Congress’
Surplus Book Program. This initiative
offers surplus books of all kinds and for
all ages to organizations and institu-
tions nationwide to help build their
book collections, and I encourage those
interested to visit the library’s website
for more information.
Mr. Speaker, reading at a young age
is important, but a passion for books
can form at any stage of life.
During National Literacy Month,
let’s all pick up a new book and share
the reading experience with the chil-
dren in our lives.

WHISTLEBLOWER
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-

that they found to be a credible person
and a credible complaint threatening
the security of our country—that a
phone conversation had taken place be-
tween our President and the President
of Ukraine suggesting that he should,
the President of Ukraine, go into a
criminal investigation that would af-
fect the election of 2020, and condi-
tioned it through actions on military
aid to Ukraine.
This is suborning the Constitution
and threatening our national security.
Mr. Speaker, I commend Speaker
PELOSI for calling for an impeachment
inquiry. It is the right time. It is the
right issue. This is an egregious sub-
version of our Constitution.
Long may the United States survive
and live as a true democracy.
f
HONORING SERGEANT VERNON
JUDD
(Mr. GIBBS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, like more
than a million Americans, Vernon Judd
was drafted into service during the Ko-
rean war. Leaving his hometown in
Stark County, Ohio, to serve in the
Army, Vernon Judd was one of ten
children, with whom he left behind
fond memories.
His younger brother, Ken, recalled
fireworks shows Vernon would put on
for the community.
Sergeant Judd was just 6 weeks away
from being relieved of duty when he
went missing in action in 1950.
Being taken to a Korean prisoner of
war camp, Judd survived just a few
months before succumbing to starva-
tion, dysentery, and exposure to the
elements, according to a fellow POW
military doctor. It was not until 1954
that Judd’s family learned of his death.
Nearly 70 years after his death, Ser-
geant Vernon Judd was identified and
returned home to Ohio.
On Tuesday, he was laid to rest at
Ohio Western Reserve National Ceme-
tery, and the homecoming celebration
attracted thousands.
Vernon Judd is one of many Ameri-
cans who lost their life in service to
our Nation. His homecoming may be
delayed, but it was welcomed. It brings
peace, relief, and comfort to the Judd
family.
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join
me in celebrating and honoring Ser-
geant Vernon Judd and pray the fami-
lies of the remaining servicemembers
missing in action find the same peace.
f
NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to highlight National Recovery
Month.
The opioid crisis is deeply prevalent
in upstate New York, and my district
is home to some of the highest over-
dose rates in the State. Overdose
deaths have increased by 83 percent
from 2016 in my home county,
Dutchess.
Combating this crisis must include
addressing the prevalence of opioids,
holding Big Pharma accountable, and
treating addiction like the disease that
it is.
Earlier this year, I introduced the bi-
partisan Mainstreaming Addiction
Treatment Act.
This act does away with seeking spe-
cial waivers as a requirement for pro-
viders to prescribe buprenorphine, a
proven treatment for addiction. Mak-
ing this medication more accessible
will save lives and destigmatize addic-
tion so folks will see it for what it is:
a disease that requires treatment.
As we recognize National Recovery
Month, let us honor those we have lost
with action on bipartisan legislation to
help those suffering with this disease.
Inaction costs us lives every day.
Let’s pass H.R. 2482.
f
HELP FOR OUR DAIRY INDUSTRY
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, while our
Nation’s farmers continue to bear the
brunt of the obstruction stopping pas-
sage of the USMCA, there is a lot we
can do to help our struggling dairy in-
dustry.
Currently, I am a proud cosponsor of
three bills that would do just that and
implement the priorities of not just
farmers in Pennsylvania’s 12th Con-
gressional District, but farmers across
our Nation.
The bipartisan Dairy Pride Act would
provide truth in labeling by preventing
nondairy products made from nuts,
algae, seeds, and plants from using
dairy terms.
The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act
of 2019, introduced by Pennsylvania’s
own G.T. THOMPSON, would increase
consumption of whole milk in our
schools, allowing children to reap the
taste and nutritional benefits of whole
milk, and is a win-win for both chil-
dren and dairy producers alike.
In addition, the School Milk Nutri-
tion Act of 2019, also sponsored by Con-
gressman THOMPSON, would roll back
another bad policy from the Obama
years and would codify that schools
may offer flavored low-fat milk in the
National School Lunch Program.
Mr. Speaker, if Democrat leaders will
not bring up the USMCA for a vote and
help our dairy farmers by doing things
like eliminating Canada’s Class 7 milk,
then we should act to find other ways
to solve these problems for our dairy
farmers. These are three bills that are
a great start.
f
END THE RECKLESS TRADE WAR
(Mr. CISNEROS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, the
President continues to talk about how
the tariffs are working, how China is
struggling, their economy is hurting,
and they are ready to make a deal.
The reality is American businesses
are suffering. The trade tariffs have
had a negative impact on small busi-
nesses and consumers in my district.
I recently met with SEMA, the Spe-
cialty Equipment Market Association,
an organization that represents nearly
8,000 businesses across the country, 1
million workers, and revenue of over
$45 billion. Seventy-five of those busi-
nesses are in California’s 39th Congres-
sional District.
The ongoing uncertainty and threats
of new tariffs create an atmosphere of
unpredictability and uncertainty that
can inhibit growth and innovation.
Mr. Speaker, while businesses want
to address unfair trade practices, they
disagree with the administration’s
reckless approach to impose tariffs.
These tariffs have increased prices for
American consumers, hurt businesses,
and harmed American families, not for-
eign countries.
China is no closer to making a deal
than it was 6 months ago.
Let’s end this reckless trade war for
the sake of our consumers, our busi-
nesses in California’s 39th, and across
the country.
f
HONORING CAPTAIN JASON JONES
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and legacy of
Captain Jason Jones from Orwigsburg,
Pennsylvania.
Captain Jones graduated at the top
of his class from the United States
Military Academy at West Point. After
graduating, he served as team leader
for the U.S. Army’s 1st Battalion, 3rd
Group Special Forces.
While deployed overseas, he was trag-
ically killed in action on June 2, 2014,
in Afghanistan.
Jason is survived by his wife, Dr.
Amy Jones; parents, Jay and Suzy
Jones; and sister and brother-in-law,
Drs. Elizabeth and Alex Gambogi.
I recently attended an event that
raised funds to honor Jason’s service
and ultimate sacrifice. The fundraiser
was attended by hundreds of family
and friends. The event raises money for
scholarships, benefiting those in the
community who are interested in fol-
lowing Jason’s patriotic pursuit of
military service.
Mr. Speaker, let us never forget and
always support those, like Captain
Jason Jones, who made the ultimate
sacrifice to safeguard our freedoms.
Jason is so lovingly remembered by
his family and his community. He has
left behind a great legacy and a proud
and grateful community and country.

HONORING MARCA BRISTO
(Ms. SHALALA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
honor of a friend, Marca Bristo, the
brilliant advocate for people with dis-
abilities. She passed away recently at
the age of 66.
In 1977, she became paralyzed from
the chest down after a diving accident
at the age of 23. As she adjusted to life
in a wheelchair, she struggled to navi-
gate in an often deeply inaccessible
world.
Before long, she founded what is now
Access Living, a Chicago-based non-
profit organization focusing on service
and advocacy for people with disabil-
ities. She served as CEO until shortly
before her death.
Marca helped write the Americans
with Disabilities Act, landmark legis-
lation that extended the Civil Rights
Act to people with disabilities. The bill
was signed into law in 1990.
Four years later, President Clinton
appointed her to serve as Chair of the
National Council on Disability, where
she continued working to increase ac-
cessibility and to fight disability dis-
crimination.
Her work revolutionized disability
rights. She melded an unparalleled
sense of legislative strategy with deep
compassion for people with disabilities.
We will remember her with pride as
we continue to work to expand dis-
ability rights.
f
AMERICA MUST LEAD ON CLIMATE
CHANGE
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, this
week, the United Nations is hosting its
Climate Action Summit. Robust fund-
ing and sound policies are needed to en-
sure we effectively combat climate
change.
Threatened by increasingly more fre-
quent and extreme changes in our cli-
mate, territories like the U.S. Virgin
Islands stand at the front line of this
quickly escalating climate crisis.
Within the past decade, my district
has reduced fossil fuel use by 20 percent
and has become a regional leader in
clean energy. States and territories
have also passed regional and State-
specific legislation to combat climate
change, but we need a comprehensive,
forward-looking national plan to ad-
dress this threat to our children and
our children’s children.
While we don’t yet have all the tools
to address rapid climate change, we
must create them through increased
Federal investment in research, devel-
opment, and deployment of emerging
technologies.
Across the Nation, climate change is
threatening our economy and our lives.
Hurricanes like Irma and Maria collec-
tively cost $140 billion, according to
NOAA, and, most importantly, they
cost thousands of lives.
America must lead the charge to pre-
serve our planet.
f
END HIDDEN TRAVEL FEES
(Ms. JOHNSON of Texas asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
this summer, we witnessed a record
number of Americans take the oppor-
tunity to travel. Unfortunately, this
also meant a record number of trav-
elers were subjected to hidden fees
charged by hotels, motels, and other
places of accommodation.
It is projected that, in 2019 alone,
over $3 billion in revenue will be col-
lected from consumers due to these de-
ceptive hidden fees.
That is why I, along with my col-
league Mr. FORTENBERRY from Ne-
braska, have introduced H.R. 4489, the
Hotel Advertising Transparency Act.
This bill would require the prices regu-
larly advertised by hotels and online
travel agencies to include all manda-
tory fees that will be charged to a con-
sumer, excluding taxes.
Mr. Speaker, consumers deserve full
transparency when making their travel
plans. They should be able to enjoy
their vacations without being ripped
off and financially burdened with al-
most twice as much as the room that
had been advertised.

from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL), pending
which I yield myself such time as I

this resolution, all time yielded is for
the purpose of debate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
be given 5 legislative days to revise and
extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, on
Wednesday, the Rules Committee met
and reported a rule, House Resolution
591, providing for consideration of S.J.
Res. 54, relating to a national emer-
gency declared by the President on
February 15, 2019, under a closed rule.
The rule provides 1 hour of debate
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infra-
structure and provides one motion to
commit.
Mr. Speaker, this joint resolution,
pursuant to the National Emergencies
Act, would terminate the national
emergency declared by the President
issued in July of this year. The same
day that President Trump declared a
state of emergency at our southern
border, he, himself, said, ‘‘I didn’t need
to do this.’’ It is now clear that state-
ment is true.
The President used an authority
commonly used for construction at
military bases in foreign countries dur-
ing a time of emergency. That author-
ity is now being used to divert $3.6 bil-
lion away from needed military con-
struction projects to build a wall that
does not have the needed political sup-
port in the House and Senate to be
funded through normal appropriations.
This emergency declaration was a po-
litically motivated power grab seeking
to undermine congressional authority
to oversee Federal spending.
The executive cannot run roughshod
over this constitutional principle when
the President fails to gain enough sup-
port for his policies. And exaggerating
the threat posed by asylum seekers at
our border has not been a convincing
argument.
The American people have spoken.
Over 60 percent of the public opposed
this emergency declaration.
What has been the result of the Pres-
idential proclamation? Life safety vio-
lations and fire risks at dilapidated
military facilities are going
unaddressed. The Pentagon has been
forced to defund billions of dollars
from 127 different military construc-
tion projects around the Nation and
the globe.
In Portsmouth, Virginia, a ware-
house has life-threatening conditions,
but 330 servicemembers and civilian
workers will continue to work in a
building without enough fire exits and
without a working fire alarm or sprin-
kler system. That doesn’t seem to mat-
ter to President Trump, though. Fenc-
ing and barriers along the border are
more important to our Commander in
Chief.
In Maryland, money is being diverted
from a planned childcare facility to
help soldiers balance their family com-
mitments with their service to our
country.
In Kentucky, a middle school has lost
out on $66 million in construction fund-
ing.
In South Carolina, they won’t be get-
ting the fire station approved and fund-
ed by Congress.
Our Armed Forces are also being de-
nied a drone pilot training facility, a
ballistic missile field, a submarine
maintenance building, multiple train-
ing facilities, access improvements,
and safety upgrades.
In my home State of New York, a
$160 million appropriation is being
taken away from projects at the United
States Military Academy at West
Point, including a state-of-the-art en-
gineering facility to support the Center
for Innovation and Engineering.
After being promised that Mexico
would be paying for this wall, we are,
instead, harming military readiness,
safety, and innovation in response to a
politically exaggerated threat.
We, in Congress, have already done
our job to put military construction
dollars where they are needed most.
Now it is time for Congress to do our
duty again and prevent this overreach
by the President.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote for this rule and for the under-
lying resolution, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from
New York for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, I am usually pretty ex-
cited to be down here on the House
floor talking about the rule. It is al-
ways an opportunity to set the stage
for what the House is getting ready to
do, and this is a body that is filled with
men and women who want to get some-
thing done. The honor that Mr.
MORELLE and I have to come down and
always begin that conversation is a
special one.
Today, unfortunately, we are not
coming down here to get new business
done. We are coming down here on the
exact same language that we have al-
ready considered this year, the exact
same language that the House has al-
ready passed this year, the exact same
language that the President has al-
ready vetoed this year, and absolutely
no expectation that anything different
is going to happen this time.
Mr. Speaker, when we talk about
emergencies, the irony is not lost on
me that I do consider it to be an emer-
gency when thousands upon thousands
of unaccompanied children are crossing
the southern border in need of housing,
in need of healthcare, and in need of
food, clothing, and care.
I do consider it an emergency when
we have a southern border that is po-
rous, that is the transit point for
drugs, for human trafficking, and for
weapons trafficking. I do consider that
an emergency.
My friends on the other side of the
aisle take issue with the President and
his declaration of that emergency.
Again, the irony is that we had an
emergency meeting in the Rules Com-
mittee last night so that we could
come down here and declare this a non-
emergency.
It is a bipartisan, bicameral goal to
provide safety and security on every
border of the United States of America.
I would encourage my colleagues to
take a look at what happened in this
body yesterday.
Again, I thank my friend from New
York for his role in it on the Rules
Committee. We brought a resolution to
the floor with the rule that was going
to demand the production of docu-
ments from the White House. When we
considered that resolution in the Rules
Committee, it was full of partisan ac-
cusation after partisan accusation
after partisan accusation before it got
down to a request for a document.
That was going to come to the floor,
and it was going to pass, but it was
going to pass in a strictly partisan
vote. I would argue that diminishes the
institution and diminishes the cause
that the majority was seeking.
To the majority’s credit, during con-
sideration of the rule, they rescinded
all of those whereases, took all the par-
tisan material out of that resolution,
brought the very same document re-
quest to the floor, and it passed unani-
mously.
There is so much that we have in
common, Mr. Speaker, that gets over-
shadowed by the partisan nonsense
that occurs here day in and day out.
I want to ask my friends—and I re-
gret that I didn’t do it last night in the
Rules Committee; I should have—to
take a look at H.R. 1410.
b 1230
H.R. 1410 is a bipartisan bill that does
what I know we both want to do as Ar-
ticle I Members, and that has changed
the language of the National Emer-
gencies Act so that Congress does re-
claim the power from the administra-
tion.
Today, as you know, Mr. Speaker,
the President gets to decide what is an
emergency. We delegated that author-
ity to him. Right or wrong, the Con-
gress—not this Congress, but a pre-
vious Congress—delegated that oppor-
tunity.
Mr. REED from New York, again, in a
bipartisan way, introduced language in
February of this year, as this was un-
folding the first time, to say let’s fix
this language once and for all. Let’s
not have ourselves in a partisan debate
on the House floor about whether we
like what one President or another did.
Let’s reclaim Article I’s power and de-
cide that no President is going to be
able to disburse funds as he or she
seats fit, that Congress is going to re-
claim that responsibility.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8001
September 26, 2019
To the best of my knowledge, Mr.
Speaker, H.R. 1410 has not moved
through committee. It certainly has
not been considered by the Rules Com-
mittee, and it certainly is not headed
to this floor.
We have a choice, Mr. Speaker. We
can continue to find things to argue
about, or we can unite around those
things that we all know to be right.
I don’t disagree with my friends on
the other side of the aisle who want to
reclaim Article I’s authority. I share
that goal, support that goal, and would
gladly apply my vote to that goal.
What I do disagree with is a Congress
that has failed to create a functioning
budget process—that is functioning by
continuing resolution now through No-
vember—and, instead of responding to
what I think are very legitimate re-
quests from this White House for addi-
tional resources on the southern bor-
der, has chosen again to bring a bill
that may well pass this House but will
not be signed by the President and will
not impact the future goings on in this
government, as I know we all want to
do.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MORELLE. I yield myself such
time as I may consume, and thank my
colleague. Let me just point out, I will
admit, when I arrived here in Novem-
ber, having been elected in a special
election, I was somewhat curious
that—I think the last emergency meet-
ing of the Rules Committee in the
115th Congress, the last one dealt with
cheese curds. So I am not exactly sure
how my friend and colleague defines
emergencies.
What I do know is that this section of
the National Emergencies Act, really,
was constructed to help the President
and the country deal with emergencies
that arise before the Congress can act,
but it is not intended to overrule con-
gressional action. The Congress did act
on this issue—there can be no question
about that—during the last appropria-
tions process.
The other thing that the gentleman
mentions, which I do want to make
clear, is the reason that we are doing
this now, it is different. Perhaps the
resolution is not different, but we now
have a complete list of all of the
projects that are now being defunded in
order to move dollars over to the wall.
I would also just point out that, not
only was the original resolution bipar-
tisan in the Senate, but the resolution
which passed within the last few days
had 11 Republican Senators support it.
I think one was unavailable who had
supported it in the past and indicated
that he would continue to support the
resolution. So it is bipartisan.
This is truly the act of Congress. I
know that my friend and colleague is
well-associated with Article I, Section
9, Clause 7 of the United States Con-
stitution: ‘‘No money shall be drawn
from the Treasury, but in consequence
of appropriations made by law. . . . ’’
So we are bound, and the Congress
has acted. The Congress made the deci-
sion not to fund this. The President is
using powers in a way that were not in-
tended and diverting dollars away from
much-needed, necessary projects that
enhance our military readiness.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I am not certain that I
disagree with my friend from New York
about the language being used as it was
intended; what I am certain about is
the language is being used as it is writ-
ten. It is incumbent upon this Con-
gress, if we don’t like the way the laws
were drafted—that we drafted—that we
go back and we change those laws.
As the Speaker well knows, yester-
day, we dealt with marijuana on the
floor of the House. We didn’t decide we
were going to repeal the schedule I
classification of marijuana. We just de-
cided that, for those States that were
ignoring Federal law, we were going to
let them ignore more Federal law, too,
and go ahead and get involved in the
banking system as well.
It is lost upon me why it is that this
body has concluded that, rather than
changing things we don’t like, we
should just ignore those things or com-
plain about those things. It is the
United States Congress, and we have
an opportunity to do things. We
weren’t elected to talk about it. We
were elected to get it done, and I know
my friend from New York shares that
same passion.
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question today, we will have an
opportunity to get something done to-
gether. If we defeat the previous ques-
tion, I will bring up an amendment to
the rule to make in order debate on S.
820, the Debbie Smith Act of 2019.
Mr. Speaker, as you know, this au-
thorization language is set to expire at
the end of this month, and it provides
Federal grants to States to reduce the
DNA backlog in criminal investiga-
tions.
You don’t have to turn on two news
stations in your district, Mr. Speaker,
just turn on one. You will see the im-
pact of what going back and testing
that DNA using technologies that are
available today that were not available
years ago has meant, particularly in
rape and sexual assault cases.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous materials, immediately prior to
the vote on the previous question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, we have
subject matter experts and almost ev-
erything in this institution, Mr. Speak-
er, and I would like to yield to one of
our passionate advocates and experts
on this issue. I yield 5 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER).
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I want
to thank my friend, the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL), for his
tremendous service and for yielding to
me this time to talk about this very
pressing and important issue.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my
colleagues to defeat the previous ques-
tion so that the House of Representa-
tives can finally debate and vote on the
Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act.
While my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle play partisan games on
border security and impeachment, crit-
ical programs authorizing the testing
of DNA evidence across the country are
set to expire in just 4 days, on Sep-
tember 30.
Along with my colleague CAROLYN
MALONEY, I introduced and am the lead
Republican sponsor on the Debbie
Smith Act, with the support of the
Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Net-
work.
Debbie Smith programs provide fund-
ing to crime labs to process DNA evi-
dence and strengthen the national DNA
database that provides justice to vic-
tims.
The legislation requires that States
like mine, Missouri, create plans for
the reduction of backlogs and the test-
ing of rape kits and other DNA evi-
dence.
Since this program was created on a
bipartisan basis, nearly 200,000 DNA
matches have been made in criminal
cases, since 2005, providing justice to
the victims in cases that may other-
wise have gone unsolved. The number
of DNA samples collected is sky-
rocketing, sadly, and we need the
Debbie Smith programs now more than
ever.
The Senate has already unanimously
sent their version of the legislation
over to the House, but House leader-
ship continues to refuse to bring it to
the floor. This, Mr. Speaker, is uncon-
scionable.
Every Member of the House Repub-
lican Conference is demanding that we
bring the Debbie Smith Act to the
floor, but our pleas for justice for vic-
tims of sexual violence are being ig-
nored.
Mr. Speaker, I beg of my colleagues
to please join me in defeating the pre-
vious question and urge House leader-
ship to put politics aside and reauthor-
ize these critical programs to convict
dangerous predators and help end sex-
ual violence in our country.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, with all due respect,
this is nothing more than smoke and
mirrors. The bipartisan Debbie Smith
Act was included in the Violence
Against Women Act that was supported
by this House and was funded in the CR
which we just enacted, which I was
proud to support. I am not sure all
Members voted for the CR, but I did,
and the funding for the Debbie Smith
Act is included in that.
Obviously, to suggest that this ma-
jority in this House is not interested in
supporting women and women who are
victims of violence, is, frankly, rep-
rehensible.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8002 September 26, 2019
But let me move back to the rule of
law, which is what we are actually de-
bating here, and it relates to our au-
thority under the Emergency Powers
Act.
I do want to note, to Mr. WOODALL’s
point, we are not adding new law. This
is a resolution, which is clearly a pro-
vision in the National Emergencies Act
that allows the Congress to make the
point that the emergency, if it ever ex-
isted, no longer exists and this funding
is inappropriate, this shift of funding.
This is, again, a simple resolution
passed by the Senate, and it indicates
that, in our view, the congressional au-
thority is where the appropriations
process lies. It is articulated well in
the Constitution, and the Congress has
acted, has acted before and will act
again.
The projects that are necessary for
military construction around the globe
and throughout the United States are
vital, and support of this resolution
and the rule would be something that I
would think Mr. WOODALL and Mem-
bers of the House would agree to.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, again, I enjoy working
with the gentleman from New York.
When I think about folks who are able
to work across the aisle to get things
done around here, the gentleman from
New York is up at the top of that list.
If you have not tuned into the Rules
Committee, Mr. Speaker, number one,
shame on you. It is a vibrant discus-
sion. It happens every Monday at 5
o’clock, at least once, if not twice, at
least for an hour, if not for 5 or 6. It is
rare that Mr. MORELLE is questioning
witnesses up there that I don’t learn
something new, that I don’t gain from
his perspective.
He is absolutely right when he talks
about the resolution that the Rules
Committee is trying to send to the
floor being a bipartisan resolution.
When it passed the United States Sen-
ate, there were 11 Republicans who sup-
ported it along with all of the Demo-
crats.
What Mrs. WAGNER is proposing that
we replace it with isn’t something that
was passed by just 11 bipartisan votes;
it is something that was passed unani-
mously, Mr. Speaker.
It is true what my friend from New
York says; we included this language
in the VAWA bill that passed the
House earlier. That was a partisan ex-
ercise, too. That bill hasn’t moved
through the United States Senate.
In contrast to decades of reauthoriza-
tions here, Mr. Speaker, where this
DNA testing authorization passes as a
standalone bill with broad, bipartisan
support, this Congress, this year, for
reasons unbeknownst to me, decided to
play a political game with it.
What Mrs. WAGNER is offering us the
opportunity to do is to bring a bill that
passed unanimously in the United
States Senate to the House floor,
where it can pass unanimously here,
too.
Again, my friend from New York is
right. What this Congress has done is
provide funding for this bill all the way
through the month of November—not
the entire month of November, but 3
weeks in November. That is absolutely
true that Congress has done this im-
portant work for at least a month and
a half.
What Mrs. WAGNER is offering us the
opportunity to do is do this important
work for another 5 years, which I know
my friends on the other side want to
do.
To speak on this issue, I told my
friend from New York that I didn’t
have any speakers on the underlying
bill. It is true. I expect that to be an-
other partisan exercise. But on this
language, Mr. Speaker, I do have an-
other speaker.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentleman from North Dakota (Mr.
ARMSTRONG), one of our new Members,
if he is willing.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I un-
derstand how CRs work, but also the
set-asides go away. We have a stand-
alone bill from the Senate right now.
We could put it on the Consent Cal-
endar.
Just to give a little history, the
Debbie Smith Act originally passed in
2004, and in 2008, under Democrat con-
trol, the House passed the reauthoriza-
tion under a suspension of the rules by
voice vote. The Senate, which was
under Republican control, passed the
bill with an amendment by unanimous
consent. The House subsequently
passed the Senate amendment version,
and it was signed into law by George
W. Bush.
b 1245
In 2014 under Republican control, the
House passed the bill under suspension
by voice vote. The Democratic-con-
trolled Senate passed it under unani-
mous consent. It was signed by Presi-
dent Barack Obama.
So the question is: Why can’t we take
a standalone bill?
Why, all of a sudden, in this Congress
did it need to be part of a larger bill
that turns into partisan gamesmanship
and a fight between the two Chambers
and the two parties?
In 2017 there were approximately
136,000 rapes. Only four in ten rapes
even go reported. That is actually an
improvement. Not so many years ago it
was only two in ten. Mr. Speaker, 90,671
of those rapes are unsolved. Many of
them are never charged. Out of every
1,000 sexual assaults, 995 perpetrators
will go unpunished.
Just earlier this week I sat in the
Rules Committee, and we argued on
the repeal of forced arbitration. By the
way, I agree with my Democratic col-
leagues. Sexual assault should never be
forced into arbitration. But if we are
going to make the argument of forced
arbitration and deal with that in a
civil proceeding or an employment pro-
ceeding or those types of issues, clear-
ly, we can all agree that the single best
way to put violent sexual predators be-
hind bars in jail and in prison is with
DNA testing.
Mr. Speaker, I said it yesterday, and
I will say it again: You have the best
ability to convict criminals—the worst
kind of criminals—and you have the
ability to do it without revictimizing
the victim through a criminal process,
through a deposition, through a jury
trial. Many of the reasons these crimes
go unreported or unconvicted, particu-
larly child victims of sexual abuse, are
because of the trauma associated with
a criminal proceeding.
Do you know what happens in a
criminal proceeding with DNA evi-
dence?
You get guilty pleas, because you
can’t beat the evidence.
So conservative estimates say that
the number of rape kits is around
170,000 which are untested. Every single
one of those kits represents a human
being, and it is somebody’s mother, sis-
ter, daughter, or granddaughter. That
person has gone through a horrible,
terrible, and grotesque trauma, and
they deserve justice.
This is easy. This is easy to do. We
could do it today. We could do it to-
morrow before we go home. But here’s
the deal: it expires in 14 days, and
while we are gone for 2 weeks in recess,
5,000 more rapes will be committed.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge I am a
bit of a football fan—not much of an
expert, but a fan—and I know that
from time to time a play will be called
and a quarterback will follow all the
offensive line moving to the right of
the field and follow behind them and
appear to be handing the ball off to a
running back behind the offensive line,
but actually the quarterback has the
ball, turns around, and goes the other
way. It is called misdirection. And that
is what is happening on the floor, as we
speak.
I understand why my colleagues
don’t want to talk about the Presi-
dent’s actions. I understand why the
Members on the other side don’t want
to talk about actions that we consider
to be considerably outside what was in-
tended by the national emergency pow-
ers given to the President. So I would
like to get back, if I may, though, to
the issue at hand.
I want to just read something.
‘‘We will vote on a resolution to re-
verse the President’s ill-advised na-
tional emergency declaration that
funds the construction of a border wall
using money that Congress has appro-
priated and the President has signed
into law for other purposes, such as
military construction. . . .’’
‘‘By declaring a national emergency,
the President’s action comes into di-
rect conflict with Congress’ authority
to determine the appropriation of
funds—a power vested in Congress by
the Framers of our Constitution in Ar-
ticle I, Section IX. That is why this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8003
September 26, 2019
issue is not about strengthening our
border security, a goal that I support
and have voted to advance. Rather, Mr.
President, it is a solemn occasion in-
volving whether or not this body will
stand up for its institutional preroga-
tives and will support the separation of
powers enshrined in our Constitution.
‘‘Throughout our history, the courts
have consistently held that, ‘Only Con-
gress is empowered by the Constitution
to adopt laws directing moneys to be
spent from the U.S. Treasury.’
‘‘For the past 65 years, the courts
have determined the boundaries of
Presidential authority, vis-a-vis Con-
gress, under the doctrine of Youngs-
town Steel Sheet & Tubing, the 1952
Supreme Court case which reversed
President Truman’s seizure of U.S.
steel companies during the Korean war.
As Justice Robert Jackson explained in
his profoundly influential concurrence
in that case, the question of whether a
President’s actions are constitu-
tionally valid should be determined by
examining the source of the President’s
authority, and in this concurrence, the
Justice goes through three scenarios in
which he assesses the President’s
power.
‘‘According to Justice Jackson, when
acts taken by the President are against
the express or implied will of Congress,
the President’s power is at its lowest
ebb. Mr. President, President Trump’s
declaration clearly falls in that cat-
egory.
‘‘Now, the President rests his dec-
laration on the National Emergencies
Act, and that act fails to define pre-
cisely what constitutes an emergency,
but there is a commonsense rule that
we can apply. It is a five-part test that
was used by the Office of Management
and Budget under former President
George Herbert Walker Bush to deter-
mine whether or not requested funding
merited an emergency designation
under our budget rules. Under that
test, a spending request was designated
as an emergency only if the need for
spending met a five-part test. It had to
be necessary, sudden, urgent, unfore-
seen, and not permanent. Now, whether
or not one agrees with President
Trump that more should be done to se-
cure our southern border—and I do
agree with him on that goal—his deci-
sion to fund a border wall through a
national emergency declaration would
never pass all of this five-part test.
‘‘Another concern that I have with
the President’s declaration is that it
shifts funding away from critical mili-
tary construction projects. We don’t
know which ones. We have not been
able to get a list, but this could have
very real national security implica-
tions. And, again, I would note that the
military construction appropriations
bill incorporated projects rec-
ommended by the President and his De-
partment of Defense, was passed by
both bodies and signed into law by the
President.
‘‘Let me emphasize once again that
the question presented by this resolu-
tion is not whether you are for a border
wall or against a border wall. It is not
whether you believe that border secu-
rity should be strengthened or whether
it is sufficient. It is not whether or not
we support or oppose President Trump.
Rather, the question is a far more fun-
damental and significant one. The
question is this: Do we want the execu-
tive branch now or in the future to
hold the power of the purse—a power
that the Framers deliberately en-
trusted to Congress?
‘‘We must stand up and defend Con-
gress’ institutional powers as the
Framers intended that we would, even
when doing so is inconvenient or goes
against the outcome that we might
prefer.
‘‘I urge my colleagues to support the
resolution of disapproval and our Con-
stitution.’’
Now, some might think that was au-
thored by a Democrat, but it was not.
Senator SUSAN COLLINS of Maine issued
that back in March of 2019 when we
considered the resolution for the first
time, and, frankly, she is far more elo-
quent than I.
I think I will let it stand at that, Mr.
Speaker, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I know my friend from Maine to be
an eloquent speaker. I thought that
was classic MORELLE there. It sounded
exactly like what I would have ex-
pected my friend to say.
As you would imagine, Mr. Speaker, I
don’t disagree with Senator COLLINS,
and I don’t disagree with Mr. MORELLE.
That is just not what this resolution
does.
Whenever anybody starts talking
about constitutional law—that is why I
thought it was classic MORELLE, Mr.
Speaker, because he knows how much
the law gets me going. He is not a law-
yer and makes that point regularly in
the Rules Committee, but I am, and
when we start talking about the foun-
dation of self-governance in this coun-
try I get excited.
But this isn’t a resolution about a
constitutional question, Mr. Speaker.
Read this resolution: Pursuant to sec-
tion 202 of the National Emergencies
Act—that is the act that this Congress
passed in a previous Congress and a
previous President signed—the na-
tional emergency declared by the find-
ing of the President on February 15 is
hereby terminated.
That is exactly one of the procedures
that can be used—one of three—to end
a Presidential declaration of emer-
gency. What we are doing here today
has nothing to do with reclaiming pow-
ers of Article I. We are just following
the law that folks already wrote. We
are just following the law that folks al-
ready have said is insufficient.
If you believe this law is insufficient,
as I do, Mr. Speaker, and as I know the
majority does, H.R. 1410 is the bill to
bring to the floor to reclaim our power
that we delegated away.
If you believe it is unconstitutional,
the Court is the place to go and re-
claim that power.
This resolution simply says we dis-
agree. It is the same one we passed ear-
lier this year. It is the same one the
President vetoed earlier this year. And
we are going to have that same con-
versation again.
I pledge to my friend on the other
side of the aisle, when we get ready to
reclaim constitutional power, count me
in. I told my friend that in the Rules
Committee 2 days ago that I wanted to
support Article 1 over Article 2. I cast
that vote yesterday. I will cast that
vote again tomorrow.
But, Mr. Speaker, what my amend-
ment will do if we defeat the previous
question is in no way a partisan exer-
cise. It is in no way a divisive exercise.
It is not even the subject of disagree-
ment passing unanimously out of the
United States Senate and historically
passing unanimously out of this House.
As my good friend from North Dakota
described, it has been passed by Repub-
lican Congresses and signed by Demo-
cratic Presidents; it has been passed by
Democratic Congresses and signed by
Republican Presidents.
We do not disagree on the need to
provide these dollars to those commu-
nities to reduce that DNA backlog. I
don’t understand why since May of this
year when the Senate passed it unani-
mously this House has failed to take it
up at all.
Instead of spending our time taking
up a bill that was unanimously passed
by the Senate and never considered
here in the House, we are using our
time to take up a bill that has already
been passed by the House once and ve-
toed by the President once, so that we
can pass it by the House again and
have it vetoed by the President again.
I get the headlines. I understand
what the press releases look like. I
watch the Twitter feeds. I see the
Facebook posts. I get the communica-
tions narrative of ‘‘look at us and look
what we are doing.’’ I just grow weary
of it, as I know my friends on other
side of the aisle do, too.
I am ready to be out of the business
of ‘‘look at what I am saying.’’ I am
ready to get out of the business of
‘‘look at what I am passing.’’ I am
ready to get into the business of ‘‘look
at what we are doing together that is
getting signed into law and actually
making a difference.’’
S.J. Res. 54 won’t fall into that cat-
egory. It didn’t in the spring, and it
doesn’t today.
But DNA testing does, Mr. Speaker. I
urge my colleagues to think about
what our choices are today: go down
the same road we have been down al-
ready and do nothing. Or go down a
road that we have traveled in a bipar-
tisan way in every single authorization
going back decades, and let’s repeat
that success together today.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8004 September 26, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I don’t disagree with
my colleague that we all grow weary. I
never do of spending time with him on
the floor. I just want to acknowledge
that.
I would say a couple of things, be-
cause there is a lot to unpack here. But
fundamentally this resolution should—
I think he read it—say that, Pursuant
to the National Emergencies Act, the
emergency declaration finding is here-
by terminated. That is actually in the
law.
What we are doing in this resolution
that was already passed by the Senate
and it, hopefully, will pass—not only
the rule, but the underlying resolution
as well—and do exactly what the law
does. There is no need to change the
law.
We may disagree, and obviously we
do, about whether or not the Presi-
dent’s use of the provisions violates the
Constitution. I say, yes, my learned
colleague differs, but what is clear is
we are using this within the context of
the existing law, and so that is why we
are here.
I think the one difference, however—
and I apologize, I have to put my eye-
glasses on to see this fine print—but
one of the differences that I note is—
and I may have noted this earlier, I
apologize if I am repeating myself—but
we now have a specific list of projects.
So when I look at, for instance, in Vir-
ginia the Joint Base Langley-Eustis in
January of 2020 is expected to have dol-
lars for the construction of a cyber-ops
facility. That is money that is being
redirected.
If you look at in Oregon, Klamath
Falls, replacing fuel facilities at the
base there. If you look at—I mentioned
the child development center, I believe.
In Florida the Fire/Crash Rescue Sta-
tion at Tyndale Air Force Base. The
list goes on and on.
We now have more evidence of the
fact that these projects are vitally
needed by the military and by members
of our Armed Forces and advance the
security interests of the people of the
United States and around the world.
So we have details now of, in my
view, what amounts to an unconstitu-
tional move of dollars without congres-
sional approval. We have that. We are
acting, once again, in conjunction with
our colleagues in the Senate to end the
national emergency declaration by the
President. While we might agree or dis-
agree as to whether or not that is real-
ly an emergency, and we might dis-
agree or agree on whether or not the
use by the President of the act in the
way he did is constitutional.
What is incontrovertible is that the
current law allows us to do what we are
doing today to end the emergency, and
that is really the question before us.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
b 1300
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I am
prepared to close, and I yield myself
the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, it pleases me to see you
in the chair. It has been a North-
western day so far, but the State of
Washington has a proud tradition on
the Rules Committee.
A lot of folks don’t understand what
the Rules Committee does up there. If
you look over here on this side of the
aisle, Mr. Speaker, it looks like a rep-
resentative sample of most of the Con-
gress, but, really, it is a lot of folks
with some Rules Committee passion.
You can’t get to the House floor with-
out going through the Rules Com-
mittee.
As I think back on folks who have
served, I certainly think about Doc
Hastings as being in that category that
labored on the Rules Committee year
after year.
Mr. NEWHOUSE labored on the Rules
Committee, and I appreciate him being
down here to bring us to a close.
It is important what we do on the
Rules Committee. We bring two kinds
of bills to this floor, Mr. Speaker.
We bring things that are worked
through the process. They are collabo-
rative; they are agreeable. We get ev-
erybody on board, and we bring those
under the suspension calendar. That is
that calendar for things that we have
already sorted out.
Then there are those bills that we
hadn’t quite sorted out, those things
that might be a little controversial. In
fact, when we bring a rule to the floor,
almost every rule vote is an entirely
partisan vote because of disagreements
about the way the underlying process
was structured.
I have an amendment and a motion
in a defeating of the previous question
and amending the rule that has passed
this House through that suspension
process, through that collaborative
process, that is undisputed in the way
that it is going to help families and
communities across this community—
again, passed the Senate unanimously
in May of this year.
In the alternative, we are going to
bring a resolution that has already
passed this institution, only to be ve-
toed. It will pass this institution again,
only to be vetoed.
We often talk about how many legis-
lative days we have left on the cal-
endar. We often talk about what it is
that we can get done together. In fact,
I just came from a hearing on civility
in the Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress with folks be-
moaning how partisanship gets in the
way of productivity.
Candidly, I don’t see that in most of
my day. The men and women on both
sides of the aisle that I have the honor
of working with day in and day out,
Mr. Speaker, prioritize productivity
over partisanship across the board.
But as the gentleman from New York
(Mr. MORELLE), my friend, observed in
his football analogy, there is a quarter-
back who calls the plays in this insti-
tution. That quarterback calls the
plays, and one team runs with the
quarterback, and the other team runs
against them.
This happened for decade upon dec-
ade upon decade. Occasionally, Mr.
Speaker, we have an opportunity to get
outside of that ‘‘who is going to score,
who is going to win, who is going to
lose.’’ We have an opportunity for us
all to win, for us all to win.
Support the previous question today,
and we are going to have another op-
portunity for one side to claim victory,
one side to claim defeat, and nothing
to get done for the American people.
But defeat the previous question, have
my amendment added to the rule, and
then pass that rule, and we have an op-
portunity to do something that I say
with no doubt every single Member of
this institution believes needs to be
done.
The choice is with the Members as
they vote here in just a few minutes.
Defeat this previous question, and then
let’s pass the rule.
In the absence of that, Mr. Speaker,
if the previous question is not defeated,
then we are going to have to defeat
this rule, lest we go through the same
partisan exercise that this House has
already gone through time and time
again this year.
Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. MORELLE),
my friend, both for his friendship and
for his mentorship. He says he never
gets tired of visiting with me on the
House floor, Mr. Speaker, but inevi-
tably, he only yields me 30 minutes and
keeps the rest of the time for himself.
I don’t fault him for that. I am actu-
ally grateful for that.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
First of all, I should note that I prob-
ably shouldn’t get into a football argu-
ment with the distinguished gentleman
from Georgia, with its long history of
that sport. I also shouldn’t do it be-
cause if my wife is watching, she will
be very unhappy that I used a sports
analogy, which she decidedly does not
like.
But just to torture the analogy a lit-
tle more, because Mr. WOODALL raised
it, misdirection does have a quarter-
back, but the whole point is to fool the
opposition.
I think that is what, frankly, some of
my colleagues here today were trying
to do, is to fool the American public
about what this resolution before us is
all about. I think that is unfortunate
because the resolution on the floor is
critically important.
Before I close, I want to compliment
my friend. I do enjoy this. I know this
is a serious topic—and no one should
see it as anything else—but I always
appreciate his passion, his intellect, his
eloquence. It is always a joy to be with
him in the Rules Committee and here
on the floor, and I so appreciate that.
Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank all
of my colleagues in the Rules Com-
mittee for their support of S.J. Res. 54,
relating to a national emergency de-
clared by the President on February 15,

rule and a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the previous
question.
The material previously referred to
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows:
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this
resolution, the House shall proceed to the
consideration in the House of the bill (S. 820)
to strengthen programs authorized under the
Debbie Smith Act of 2004. All points of order
against consideration of the bill are waived.
The bill shall be considered as read. All
points of order against provisions in the bill
are waived. The previous question shall be
considered as ordered on the bill and on any
amendment thereto to final passage without
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of
debate equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of the
Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one mo-

STEM OPPORTUNITIES ACT OF 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
I move to suspend the rules and pass
the bill (H.R. 2528) to direct the Direc-
tor of the Office of Science and Tech-
nology Policy to carry out programs
and activities to ensure that Federal
science agencies and institutions of
higher education receiving Federal re-
search and development funding are
fully engaging their entire talent pool,
and for other purposes, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2528
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS;
FINDINGS.
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as
the ‘‘STEM Opportunities Act of 2019’’.
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of con-
tents for this Act is as follows:
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents; findings.
Sec. 2. Purposes.
Sec. 3. Federal science agency policies for care-
givers.
Sec. 4. Collection and reporting of data on Fed-
eral research grants.
Sec. 5. Policies for review of Federal research
grants.
Sec. 6. Collection of data on demographics of

pand STEM opportunities.
Sec. 10. Tribal Colleges and Universities Pro-
gram.
Sec. 11. Report to Congress.
Sec. 12. Merit review.
Sec. 13. Definitions.
(c) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) Many reports over the past decade have
found that it is critical to our Nation’s economic
leadership and global competitiveness that the
United States educates and trains more sci-
entists and engineers.
(2) Research shows that women and minorities
who are interested in STEM careers are dis-
proportionately lost at nearly every educational
transition and at every career milestone.
(3) The National Center for Science and Engi-
neering Statistics at the National Science Foun-
dation collects, compiles, analyzes, and pub-
lishes data on the demographics of STEM de-
grees and STEM jobs in the United States.
(4) Women now earn nearly 37 percent of all
STEM bachelor’s degrees, but major variations
persist among fields. In 2017, women earned
only 20 percent of all bachelor’s degrees award-
ed in engineering and 19 percent of bachelor’s
degrees awarded in computer sciences. Based on
Bureau of Labor Statistics data, jobs in com-
puting occupations are expected to account for
nearly 60 percent of the projected annual
growth of newly created STEM job openings
from 2016 to 2026.
(5) In 2017, underrepresented minority groups
comprised 39 percent of the college-age popu-
lation of the United States, but only 18 percent
of students who earned bachelor’s degrees in
STEM fields. The Higher Education Research
Institute at the University of California, Los
Angeles, found that, while freshmen from
underrepresented minority groups express an in-
terest in pursuing a STEM undergraduate de-
gree at the same rate as all other freshmen, only
22.1 percent of Latino students, 18.4 percent of
African-American students, and 18.8 percent of
Native American students studying in STEM
fields complete their degree within 5 years, com-
pared to approximately 33 percent of White stu-
dents and 42 percent of Asian students who
complete their degree within 5 years.
(6) In some STEM fields, including the com-
puter sciences, women persist at about the same
rate through doctorate degrees. In other STEM
fields, women persist through doctorate degrees
at a lower rate. In mathematics, women earn
just 26 percent of doctorate degrees compared
with 42 percent of undergraduate degrees. Over-
all, women earned 38 percent of STEM doctorate
degrees in 2016. The rate of minority students
earning STEM doctorate degrees in physics is 9
percent, compared with 15 percent for bachelor’s
degree. Students from underrepresented minor-
ity groups accounted for only 11.5 percent of
STEM doctorate degrees awarded in 2016.
(7) The representation of women in STEM
drops significantly from the doctorate degree
level to the faculty level. Overall, women hold
only 26 percent of all tenured and tenure-track
positions and 27 percent of full professor posi-
tions in STEM fields in our Nation’s universities
and 4-year colleges. Black and Hispanic faculty
together hold about 6.8 percent of all tenured
and tenure-track positions and 7.5 percent of
full professor positions. Many of the numbers in
the American Indian or Alaskan Native and Na-
tive Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander cat-
egories for different faculty ranks were too small
for the National Science Foundation to report
publicly without potentially compromising con-
fidential information about the individuals
being surveyed.
(8) The representation of women is especially
low at our Nation’s top research universities.
Even in the biological sciences, in which women
now earn more than 50 percent of the doctorates
and passed the 25 percent level 37 years ago,
women make up only 25 percent of the full pro-
fessors at the approximately 100 most research-
intensive universities in the United States. In
the physical sciences and mathematics, women
make up only 11 percent of full professors, in
computer sciences only 10 percent, and across
engineering fields only 7 percent. The data sug-
gest that approximately 6 percent of all tenure-
track STEM faculty members at the most re-
search-intensive universities are from underrep-
resented minority groups, but in some fields the
numbers are too small to report publicly.
(9) By 2050, underrepresented minorities will
comprise 52 percent of the college-age popu-
lation of the United States. If the percentage of
female students and students from underrep-
resented minority groups earning bachelor’s de-
grees in STEM fields does not significantly in-
crease, the United States will face an acute
shortfall in the overall number of students who
earn degrees in STEM fields just as United
States companies are increasingly seeking stu-
dents with those skills. With this impending
shortfall, the United States will almost certainly
lose its competitive edge in the 21st century glob-
al economy.
(10) According to a 2014 Association for
Women in Science survey of over 4,000 scientists
across the globe, 70 percent of whom were men,
STEM researchers face significant challenges in
work-life integration. Researchers in the United
States were among the most likely to experience
a conflict between work and their personal life
at least weekly. One-third of researchers sur-
veyed said that ensuring good work-life integra-
tion has negatively impacted their careers, and,
of researchers intending to leave their current
job within the next year, 9 percent indicated it
was because they were unable to balance work
and life demands.
(11) Female students and students from under-
represented minority groups at institutions of
higher education who see few others ‘‘like them-
selves’’ among faculty and student populations
often do not experience the social integration
that is necessary for success in all disciplines,
including STEM.
(12) One in five children in the United States
attend school in a rural community. The data
shows that rural students are at a disadvantage
with respect to STEM readiness. Among STEM-
interested students, 17 percent of students in
rural high schools and 18 percent of students in
town-located high schools meet the ACT STEM
Benchmark, compared with 33 percent of stu-
dents in suburban high schools and 27 percent
of students in urban high schools.
(13) A substantial body of evidence establishes
that most people hold implicit biases. Decades of
cognitive psychology research reveal that most
people carry prejudices of which they are un-
aware but that nonetheless play a large role in
evaluations of people and their work. Uninten-
tional biases and outmoded institutional struc-
tures are hindering the access and advancement
of women, minorities, and other groups histori-
cally underrepresented in STEM.
(14) Workshops held to educate faculty about
unintentional biases have demonstrated success
in raising awareness of such biases.
(15) In 2012, the Office of Diversity and Equal
Opportunity of the National Aeronautics and

Space Administration (in this Act referred to as
‘‘NASA’’) completed a report that—
(A) is specifically designed to help NASA
grant recipients identify why the dearth of
women in STEM fields continues and to ensure
that it is not due to discrimination; and
(B) provides guidance that is usable by all in-
stitutions of higher education receiving signifi-
cant Federal research funding on how to con-
duct meaningful self-evaluations of campus cul-
ture and policies.
(16) The Federal Government provides 55 per-
cent of research funding at institutions of high-
er education and, through its grant-making
policies, has had significant influence on insti-
tution of higher education policies, including
policies related to institutional culture and
structure.
SEC. 2. PURPOSES.
The purposes of this Act are as follows:
(1) To ensure that Federal science agencies
and institutions of higher education receiving
Federal research and development funding are
fully engaging the entire talent pool of the
United States.
(2) To promote research on, and increase un-
derstanding of, the participation and trajec-
tories of women, minorities, and other groups
historically underrepresented in STEM studies
and careers, including persons with disabilities,
older learners, veterans, and rural, poor, and
tribal populations, at institutions of higher edu-
cation and Federal science agencies, including
Federal laboratories.
(3) To raise awareness within Federal science
agencies, including Federal laboratories, and in-
stitutions of higher education about cultural
and institutional barriers limiting the recruit-
ment, retention, promotion, and other indicators
of participation and achievement of women, mi-
norities, and other groups historically underrep-
resented in academic and Government STEM re-
search careers at all levels.
(4) To identify, disseminate, and implement
best practices at Federal science agencies, in-
cluding Federal laboratories, and at institutions
of higher education to remove or reduce cultural
and institutional barriers limiting the recruit-
ment, retention, and success of women, minori-
ties, and other groups historically underrep-
resented in academic and Government STEM re-
search careers.
(5) To provide grants to institutions of higher
education to recruit, retain, and advance STEM
faculty members from underrepresented minority
groups and to implement or expand reforms in
undergraduate STEM education in order to in-
crease the number of students from underrep-
resented minority groups receiving degrees in
these fields.

GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous materials.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas?
There was no objection.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I rise today in support of H.R. 2528,
the STEM Opportunities Act of 2019. I
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma
(Mr. LUCAS), the ranking member, for
joining me in introducing this bill. I
also thank the committee cosponsors
on both sides of the aisle and the en-
dorsing organizations.
Mr. Speaker, this bill has been a long
time coming. Over a decade ago, in
2007, I introduced an early version of
this legislation in response to the Na-
tional Academies’ report titled ‘‘Be-
yond Bias and Barriers.’’
This report was a call to action to
address the biases and outdated insti-
tutional structures in universities that
perpetuate the underrepresentation of
women in many STEM fields. The re-
port made clear that it is not a lack of
talent but external factors, like lim-
ited access to support and campus re-
sources, pay disparity, bias, and dis-
crimination, that have hindered the ad-
vancement of women in academic
STEM careers. The National Acad-
emies is conducting a follow-up study
under the leadership of former NASA
astronaut Dr. Mae Jemison.
While progress has been made, the
fact remains that women are woefully
underrepresented at all levels of STEM
studies and in STEM careers. We need
action, and we need bold leadership.
Women already comprise 50 percent
of the population. By the year 2050, ra-
cial and ethnic minorities will also
comprise 50 percent of our Nation’s
population. Many of these groups are
woefully underrepresented in STEM
fields. Our Nation will not continue to
lead in science and innovation if we do
not tap into all the talent this Nation
has to offer.
While there are unique challenges for
different groups underrepresented in
STEM, there are also many common
themes and many common solutions.
Eventually, I combined my legisla-
tion focused on the advancement of
women in STEM with another piece of
legislation focused on underrep-
resented minorities in STEM. That
combined legislation became the STEM
Opportunities Act.
The STEM Opportunities Act ad-
dresses both the uniqueness and simi-
larities, the challenges and solutions.
Over the years, I have updated this leg-
islation to incorporate new expert rec-
ommendations and stakeholder feed-
back to reflect emerging needs.
The STEM Opportunities Act of 2019
provides for research and demographic
data collection to better understand
the participation and career trajec-
tories of women and underrepresented
minorities in STEM research careers.
The bill directs the Office of Science
and Technology Policy to develop con-
sistent policies at Federal science
agencies to minimize the effects of im-
plicit bias in the grant review process,
to help universities identify and ad-
dress barriers for women and underrep-
resented minorities in STEM research
careers, and to accommodate the needs
of grant recipients who have caregiving
responsibilities.
The bill also directs the National
Science Foundation to award grants to
support computer science education at
the Nation’s Tribal colleges and uni-
versities.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 2528, the STEM Opportunities
Act of 2019. As a cosponsor of the legis-
lation with Chairwoman JOHNSON, I am
pleased the House is taking this up for
consideration today.
H.R. 2528 continues the Committee
on Science, Space, and Technology’s
long history of bipartisan support for
STEM education.
The United States is in a race to re-
main the world’s leader in science and
technology. The only way we will win
is by utilizing America’s most valuable
resources—our people. This means de-
veloping a diverse, STEM-capable
workforce at every education level and
from every background.
The administration has recognized
this need, and the President’s 5-year
STEM strategic plan specifically calls
for an increase of diversity, equality,
and inclusion in STEM programs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8010 September 26, 2019
This legislation supports and builds
upon that plan, authorizing activities
at the White House Office of Science
and Technology Policy and the Na-
tional Science Foundation.
The U.S. invests over $1 billion a
year in Federal STEM education pro-
grams, but we have not made enough
progress in growing a STEM-capable
workforce. One of the key provisions of
H.R. 2528 is a requirement for more
comprehensive data collection and
analysis on the students, researchers,
and faculty receiving Federal science
grants.
This data will help us identify and re-
duce the barriers that prevent under-
represented groups from entering and
advancing in STEM. It will also help us
measure the success of Federal STEM
programs.
The bill also includes a provision di-
recting NSF to support computer
science education through the existing
Tribal Colleges and Universities Pro-
gram.
Access to computer science resources
and the development of computing
skills is critical in today’s economy.
STEM employment in the U.S. con-
tinues to grow faster than any other
sector. Employers in all sectors, in-
cluding agriculture, energy,
healthcare, and defense, are desperate
for workers with STEM skills. In order
to meet this demand, the development
of talent from all groups is essential.
H.R. 2528 takes important steps to
ensure we are fully engaging America’s
entire talent pool and maintaining our
global leadership in science and tech-
nology.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN).
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS),
the ranking member, and the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JOHNSON), the
chairwoman, for introducing this great
bill.
Today, I rise in strong support of
H.R. 2528, the Science, Technology, En-
gineering and Mathematics Opportuni-
ties Act, introduced by those two great
colleagues.
STEM fields provide a great oppor-
tunity for academic and professional
advancement. According to the Depart-
ment of Commerce, STEM occupations
are projected to grow by close to 9 per-
cent, compared to approximately 6 per-
cent for non-STEM occupations.
b 1315
On average, students with a STEM
degree are expected to have greater job
prospects and to earn close to 12 per-
cent more in wages than their non-
STEM counterparts.
We should expect this growing trend
to continue, and, therefore, we need to
ensure we bolster STEM capabilities in
education and in the workforce to meet
the demand for STEM professionals
and remain at the forefront of sci-
entific endeavors.
H.R. 2528 helps guarantee that the
STEM community is diverse and rep-
resentative of women, minorities, rural
students, students with disabilities,
and other underrepresented groups.
Specifically, this bill directs the Of-
fice of Science and Technology Policy
to develop best practices on how to
support STEM researchers who are also
caregivers, how to best reduce the im-
pact of bias in the review of grant pro-
posals, and how to better identify cul-
tural and institutional barriers at
science agencies and Federal labs.
It also requires Federal science agen-
cies to collect demographic informa-
tion on grant proposals, awards, and
faculty, and it directs the National
Science Foundation to support the re-
search and dissemination of best prac-
tices to increase recruitment, reten-
tion, and advancement of underrep-
resented groups in STEM degree pro-
grams and research careers.
Puerto Rico has a strong STEM aca-
demic and professional sector as well.
We even created a caucus with univer-
sities—the Arecibo Observatory, among
others—to help bolster this area. I, my-
self, graduated from a STEM school.
We have remarkable STEM students
and researchers who are engaged with
their communities and are ready to
contribute to their fields by producing
innovative work for the benefit of the
island and for the Nation.
The objectives of this bill are key to
increasing the scope of the scientific
population and meeting the current de-
mands and challenges in STEM.
I am a proud cosponsor of this bill,
and I would like to thank Chairwoman
JOHNSON and Ranking Member LUCAS
for their leadership, not just in this
area, but on many other important
issues, and I encourage my colleagues
to vote in favor.
I would also like to thank them for
their leadership on the Committee on
Science, Space, and Technology and for
helping me and helping us harness the
capabilities of the Federal Government
for the advancement of science and
technology on behalf of the American
people.
Unfortunately, I will be parting with
the committee. However, I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle on science and
many other issues in the future.
I commend them both and their
staffs for all their assistance during
these months, and I wish them all the
best as they continue their great work.
I really enjoyed my stay with that
committee.
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
First, let me take a moment to note
that the gentlewoman from Puerto
Rico will indeed be missed on the
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee.
The Committee on Science, Space,
and Technology—and I think I can say
this about the beloved chair—is a com-
mittee that still reflects many of the
traditions of this House: working to-
gether for the common good, trying to
drive this great Nation and all of our
good citizens forward.
So, hopefully, at some future time,
the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico will
have the opportunity to come rejoin
us, and I look forward to that very day.
That said, in my closing remarks, I
would like to thank Chairwoman JOHN-
SON and her staff for working in a bi-
partisan fashion on this legislation and
for incorporating our feedback and
ideas. I look forward to continuing to
work with her to advance STEM edu-
cation efforts in this Congress that will
support, encourage, and develop the
next generation of STEM workers.
Maintaining our global leadership in
science and technology is critical to
our economic and national security.
We will not be able to lead without a
STEM-capable workforce for the 21st
century.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues
to support H.R. 2528, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
I rise to close and simply request that
all Members support this bill. It is a
bill that we need for the Nation and for
our Nation’s future in innovation, in
order to maintain any activity on the
world stage in innovation.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
JOHNSON) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2528, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 335, the bill under consid-
eration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas?
There was no objection.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 335, the South Florida Clean
Coastal Waters Act of 2019.
I want to thank the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. MAST) for introducing this
bill and for his commitment to this im-
portant issue.
South Florida has been suffering
from economically and ecologically
costly blooms of harmful algae in both
its marine and freshwater systems for
years, and it continues to get worse.
Last year, south Florida was plagued
with one of the most severe harmful
algal bloom, or HABs, events on record.
Simultaneous toxic red tide and mas-
sive freshwater blue-green algae
blooms choked waterways and coast-
lines. This caused a mass mortality of
wildlife, including, dolphins, manatees,
and sea turtles. Hundreds of tons of
dead fish washed up on the shores.
Beyond the millions of dollars of lost
revenue for businesses, red tide and
other HABs also pose health risks to
humans from direct exposure and from
eating infected seafood.
Low oxygen, known as hypoxia, can
result when the algae die, sink to the
bottom of the water bodies, and decay.
It is a problem in the Gulf of Mexico
‘‘dead zone’’ and is a growing problem
along coastlines where HABs persist.
The South Florida Clean Coastal
Waters Act authorizes a scientific as-
sessment and action plan to help ad-
dress the problem of HABs and hypoxia
in south Florida.
The assessment and action plan will
be conducted by the interagency Harm-
ful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research
and Control Task Force, led by NOAA
and the EPA. This task force re-
searches, monitors, addresses, and
mitigates HABs and hypoxia.
The assessment and action plan will
help identify research gaps and de-
tailed methods for mitigating and con-
trolling HABs and hypoxia in south
Florida. These documents will help
serve as a blueprint for Federal, State,
and local decisionmakers and other
stakeholders to coordinate actions to
reduce the HABs and hypoxia in the re-
gion.
Mr. Speaker, this bill takes an im-
portant step in helping address the
HABs and hypoxia issue in south Flor-
ida. I strongly support this good, bipar-
tisan bill, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Rep-
resentative MAST’s bill, H.R. 335, the
South Florida Clean Coastal Waters
Act of 2019.
This bill tasks the interagency task
force on harmful algal blooms and hy-
poxia to provide an integrated assess-
ment on the causes and consequences
of HABs, along with potential mitiga-
tion options in south Florida.
Additionally, the task force will look
at the current status of research and
identify gaps in research, monitoring,
and management efforts. This will lead
to the development of an action plan
for reducing, mitigating, and control-
ling HABs and hypoxia.
Although this bill is focused on the
south Florida region, these harmful
algal blooms have become an environ-
mental problem in all 50 States, even
in the freshwater of landlocked States
like Oklahoma.
With the passage of this legislation,
we will gain more knowledge of the
dangers associated with HABs as well
as potential mitigation strategies that
could be applied to every State and re-
gion.
I want to thank Representative MAST
and Representative WALTZ for encour-
aging this interagency collaboration to
conduct research that will protect our
environment and health.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8012 September 26, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. MAST), who has worked so dili-
gently on this bill.
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman for yielding; I thank the
gentlewoman for her support; and I
thank the committee for their work on
this piece of legislation.
Now, HABHRCA is what we are talk-
ing about here. That is what a lot of
people know it as.
Since 1998 and the creation of
HABHRCA, the Harmful Algal Bloom
and Hypoxia Research and Control
Amendments Act, this interagency
task force has done incredible work in
different areas across the country, and
they have done incredible work by
working collaboratively across a num-
ber of different agencies.
Whether you are talking about the
Department of Commerce, Interior,
HHS, CDC, EPA, and looping in there
the Corps of Engineers, the work has
been outstanding, and it is what is
needed: collaborative efforts to go out
there and research and find real re-
sults, mitigate the occurrences of these
harmful algal blooms and hypoxia, and
do this in waterways across our Nation.
Now, H.R. 335, the South Florida
Clean Coastal Waters Act of 2019, fo-
cuses that interagency capability on
the Nation’s most devastating example
of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia to
date: those that have occurred in the
south Florida area.
It truly is an environmental emer-
gency that, unfortunately, many have
witnessed on the news and seen in
other places, and it has been a result of
what has happened for almost a cen-
tury: The U.S. Government has em-
barked on a piecemeal compilation of
infrastructure projects across Florida
that really contorted and misshaped
the natural waterways of Florida.
Now, decades ago, it was realized
that this patchwork of uncoordinated
and often very conflicting flows of
water design resulted in toxic con-
centrations of nutrients in one area or
the elimination of natural filtration
systems that used to purify the waters
of Florida. So south Florida, today, is
now riddled with environmental catas-
trophes from north to south, like
harmful algal blooms, red tide, and hy-
poxia, these toxic overgrowths from
these ecological disasters.
We have seen far too many of the
devastating effects: massive fish kills
around the Florida peninsula, carcasses
of whale sharks, dolphins, manatee,
millions of pounds of sea life washing
up on our shores, results of deaths of
many other animals, and, unfortu-
nately, unknown health effects to hu-
mans that come in contact with this.
Now, a couple important factors that
have played into this:
In July, the Corps of Engineers testi-
fied that, for decades, it had knowingly
discharged enormous quantities of
toxic, harmful algal bloom-laden water
from the 730-square-mile lake in the
middle of south Florida, Lake Okee-
chobee, and one of those toxins that
makes up harmful algal blooms that is
so dangerous: cyanobacteria.
After many requests, the EPA, this
year, made a report that said harmful
algal blooms that had cyanobacteria of
over 8 parts per billion, humans should
not come in contact with.
To put that into perspective, we were
having discharges of these kinds of
algal blooms to the tune of 495 parts
per billion last summer, so very, very
serious health risks going on there.
b 1330
They crippled the economy. They
crippled small businesses. Tourism,
fisheries, those things get destroyed. It
devastates, obviously, the environ-
ment. It creates dying ecosystems.
It is in that that I thank the com-
mittee for their support on this be-
cause it is very serious to our commu-
nity.
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. WALTZ), a member of the Science,
Space, and Technology Committee who
also is very focused on these issues.
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my delegation colleague, Congressman
MAST, for drafting this important bill,
the South Florida Clean Coastal
Waters Act of 2019, to address the HABs
problem, the harmful algal blooms, and
improve water quality in Florida.
I also thank Senator RUBIO for intro-
ducing the Senate companion, and I
give credit to my predecessor in Con-
gress, now-Governor DeSantis, for
prioritizing clean water at the State
level.
Red tides and green algae have
plagued Florida in recent years. As we
have discussed here today, it impacts
Lake Okeechobee, the Everglades, In-
dian River Lagoon in my district, and
both of Florida’s coasts.
Last Congress, the Interagency Task
Force on HABs was reauthorized, which
was a very important step. This bill en-
sures that the task force will produce
an integrated assessment on the
causes, consequences, and approaches
to reduce HABs; identify the current
gaps in research; and, very impor-
tantly, produce an action plan to deal
with it.
The focus of the task force is the Ev-
erglades, and the health of the Ever-
glades impacts water quality across
the State.
The scope of the introduced version
for H.R. 335 attempted to take this into
account by including ‘‘contiguous
coastal near-shore water’’ in the defini-
tion of eligible waterways. However,
‘‘contiguous’’ could be interpreted by
the task force—this was my concern—
in any number of ways, potentially ex-
cluding the northern reaches of the In-
dian River Lagoon.
The entire Indian River Lagoon is
part of the National Estuary Program,
and the southern section is an Army
Corps of Engineers authorized reservoir
included in the Comprehensive Ever-
glades Restoration Plan.
According to the Army Corps, Indian
River Lagoon is ‘‘home to more than
3,000 species of plants and animals’’ and
‘‘considered the most biologically di-
verse estuarine system in the conti-
nental United States.’’
This dynamic ecosystem is sensitive.
It is important to the environment for
those reasons, but critically, it is also
important to our economy. A 2016 eco-
nomic valuation study found that the
output of the lagoon is about $7.6 bil-
lion annually.
For these reasons, it is the right
thing to do to ensure the Interagency
HABs Task Force includes the entire
lagoon.
In coordination with Congressman
MAST, I offered a management amend-
ment in the Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee markup that lists
the entire Indian River Lagoon in the
definition of waterways to be included
in this bill.
We are not just seeing HABs in
southern Florida. It is now spreading
to other parts of my district and all
parts of Florida. We have already seen
blue-green algae in the St. Johns River
and even spreading into our springs.
Protecting the springs in central Flor-
ida is an ongoing effort.
It is for this reason that the task
force’s integrated assessment is so im-
portant. It will improve water quality
management and prevent harmful algal
blooms across the entire lagoon.
Moving forward, the Congress should
examine the Clean Water State Revolv-
ing Fund allotment formula, which has
not been updated since 1987.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the
gentleman an additional 1 minute.
Mr. WALTZ. Importantly, in 2018,
Florida received the third lowest allot-
ment per capita, according to the EPA,
yet it has the third most significant in-
frastructure needs in the country. This
is unacceptable, particularly for a pro-
gram so important in a State where
water is so critical to our way of life.
I thank Congressman LUCAS. I again
thank Congressman MAST for his work
on HABs and this important legislation
before us today.
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 335 provides crit-
ical research on the harmful algal
blooms and hypoxia in southern Flor-
ida and will develop an action plan to
mitigate and control this environ-
mental threat.
I thank Representative MAST, and
my Science, Space, and Technology
Committee colleague, Representative
WALTZ, for their leadership on this bill.
I strongly encourage all of my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan leg-
islation.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

Agency of the Department, may establish an
incentive-based program that allows indus-
try, individuals, academia, and others to
compete in providing remediation solutions
for cybersecurity vulnerabilities (as such
term is defined in section 2209 of the Home-
land Security Act of 2002, as amended by sec-
tion 2).
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas?
There was no objection.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3710, the Cybersecurity Vulner-
ability Remediation Act, and I thank
Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON for his
work in securing the Nation against
terrorist threats, including cybersecu-
rity vulnerabilities that target critical
infrastructure, civilian agency net-
works, and private-sector cyber re-
sources.
I also thank subcommittee Chairman
RICHMOND and the Committee on
Homeland Security staff for working
with my staff and me on H.R. 3710.
I thank the ranking member of the
full committee, Mr. ROGERS from Ala-
bama, and the ranking member of the
subcommittee.
Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago,
we saw technology in the form of
drones be utilized to attack, with ex-
plosives, refineries in Saudi Arabia. I
think the basis of my legislation
speaks to the point that it is crucial
that this Congress and this Nation pre-
pare itself for new forms of technology.
We have not had that incident here
in the United States, but if we recall,
in 9/11, no one could fathom using load-
ed airplanes, fully filled with the mate-
rial, fuel, that could be utilized as a
weapon to attack the World Trade Cen-
ter, to kill the brave at the Pentagon
and the brave in Pennsylvania.
H.R. 3710 is to speak to those vulner-
abilities, in particular, cybersecurity
vulnerability remediation, which di-
rects the DHS to prioritize efforts to
help network operators address known
vulnerabilities.
It requires DHS’ Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency to
widely share mitigation protocols that
counter cybersecurity vulnerabilities,
authorizing the DHS Science and Tech-
nology Directorate to establish an in-
centive-based program to allow indus-
try, individuals, agencies, and aca-
demia to compete in providing remedi-
ation solutions for the highest priority
cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
We must be ever vigilant and diligent
as we look to these new levels and sub-
sets of technology. It requires the CISA
to report to Congress on its efforts to
share mitigation protocols and coordi-
nate vulnerability disclosure with its
partners.
H.R. 3710 authorizes, for the first
time, the Cybersecurity and Infrastruc-
ture Security Agency to develop and
distribute playbooks, in consultation
with private-sector experts, to provide
procedures and mitigation strategies
for the most critical known vulnerabil-
ities, especially those affecting soft-
ware or hardware that is no longer sup-
ported by a vendor.
One of the statistics that we really
know is that 80 percent—maybe even
higher now—to 85 percent of the Na-
tion’s vulnerabilities—technology, in-
frastructure—is in the private sector.
Those are the sites that our enemies
would look eagerly to attack. The
World Trade Center; in Saudi, the re-
fineries; maybe some of our beautiful
national monuments, outstanding sites
here in Washington, D.C.; our national
parks, these are the examples and the
exhibits of the freedom of this Nation.
Those are some government, some pri-
vate sector.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8014 September 26, 2019
Many know the terror that New York
collectively faced, but there are other
sites along the West Coast, in the Mid-
west, and in the Deep South that would
also exhibit what the freedom of Amer-
ica is all about.
The playbooks that we would make
available to Federal agencies, industry,
and other stakeholders would help
them prepare a network defense in the
event of a cyberattack based upon vul-
nerability. I would like to think that
we could prevent that attack.
A zero-day vulnerability is a software
bug or exploit that has not been
patched. Hackers can use these bugs
and exploits based upon the vulnerabil-
ity to steal data or damage networks
before a patch can be developed to pre-
vent a breach.
There are some vulnerabilities that
cannot be patched. These require the
resources provided by the playbook
that will be provided in my bill.
H.R. 3710 authorizes the DHS Science
and Technology Directorate, in con-
sultation with CISA, to establish a
competition program for industry, in-
dividuals, academia, and others to pro-
vide remediation solutions for cyberse-
curity vulnerabilities that are no
longer supported.
The good news is that it seeks to
have the consultation of Americans
who have expertise and to be able to
work with them to provide the remedi-
ation but also the playbook for preven-
tion.
The vulnerabilities that will receive
an entry in the playbook are serious
and, if used by an adversary, can lead
to significant costs and disruption of
vital goods and services to the public.
Just think of your water system, run
mostly by local entities, or the electric
grid, run mostly by the private sector.
In the 115th Congress, I introduced
H.R. 3202, Cyber Vulnerability Disclo-
sure Reporting Act, which addresses
the Federal Government’s sharing of
cyber vulnerability disclosures to crit-
ical infrastructure owners and opera-
tors. H.R. 3710 goes further to address
the remediation of identified cyberse-
curity threats by incentivizing work to
patch or find solutions for cyber
threats inherent in legacy systems.
Proactive and coordinated efforts are
necessary to strengthen, maintain, and
secure critical infrastructure, includ-
ing assets that are vital to public con-
fidence in the cyber nation’s safety.
I hope that we will see our way for-
ward in getting proactive and prevent-
ative as we move toward new levels of
technology.
Mr. Speaker I rise today to speak in favor of
H.R. 3710, the ‘‘Cybersecurity Vulnerability
Remediation Act.’’
I thank Chairman BENNIE G. THOMPSON for
his work in securing the nation against terrorist
threats, including cybersecurity vulnerabilities
that target critical infrastructure, civilian agen-
cy networks, and private sector cyber re-
sources.
I thank Subcommittee Chairman RICHMOND
and the Homeland Security Committee staff
for working with me and my staff on H.R.
3710.
H.R. 3710, the ‘‘Cybersecurity Vulnerability
Remediation Act’’ directs DHS to prioritize ef-
forts to help network operators address known
vulnerabilities by:
1. Requiring DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency (CISA) to widely
share mitigation protocols to counter cyberse-
curity vulnerabilities;
2. Authorizing the DHS Science and Tech-
nology Directorate to establish an incentive-
based program to allow industry, individuals,
agencies, and academia to compete in pro-
viding remediation solutions for the highest pri-
ority cybersecurity vulnerabilities; and
3. Requiring CISA to report to Congress on
its efforts to share mitigation protocols and co-
ordinate vulnerability disclosures with its part-
ners.
H.R. 3710, authorizes for the first time the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency
(CISA) to develop and distribute ‘‘playbooks,’’
in consultation with private sector experts, to
provide procedures and mitigation strategies
for the most critical, known vulnerabilities, es-
pecially those affecting software or hardware
that is no longer supported by a vendor.
The playbooks would be available to Fed-
eral agencies, industry, and other stakeholders
to help them prepare network defense in the
event of a cyber-attack based upon a vulner-
ability.
A zero-day vulnerability is a software bug or
exploit that has not been patched.
Hackers can use these bugs and exploits
based upon the vulnerability to steal data or
damage networks before a patch can be de-
veloped to prevent a breach.
There are some vulnerabilities that cannot
be patched and these require the resources
provided by the Playbook that will be provided
by this bill.
H.R. 3710 authorizes DHS Science and
Technology Directorate (S&T), in consultation
with CISA, to establish a competition program
for industry, individuals, academia, and others
to provide remediation solutions for cybersecu-
rity vulnerabilities that are no longer sup-
ported.
The vulnerabilities that will receive entry into
the Playbook are serious and if used by an
advisory, can lead to significant cost and dis-
ruption of vital goods and services to the pub-
lic.
In the 115th Congress, I introduced H.R.
3202, Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting
Act, which addresses the federal government’s
sharing of cyber vulnerability disclosures to
critical infrastructure owners and operators.
H.R. 3710 goes further to address the reme-
diation of identified cybersecurity threats by
incentivizing work to patch or find solutions for
cyber threats inherent in legacy systems.
Proactive and coordinated efforts are nec-
essary to strengthen and maintain secure crit-
ical infrastructure, including assets that are
vital to public confidence in the cyber nation’s
safety.
This bill supports the ongoing work of the
Department of Homeland Security in security
civilian agency and coordinating with private
sector computing network owners and opera-
tors.
Most people do not know how long the fed-
eral government has used computing to carry
out vital functions in service of the public.
The Federal government’s first use of com-
puting technology occurred in 1890 when an
automated tabulation method was used to or-
ganize that year’s census data encoded on
punch cards.
Since that modest beginning in 1890, the
Federal government has blazed a path for
adoption of computing technology throughout
the federal government, which established an
unprecedented pace for innovation in the pri-
vate sector that transformed our world from
analogue to digital in 129 years.
One of the consequences of federal govern-
ment’s use of computing technology over the
last 129 years are the challenges of operating
legacy systems that use outdated software,
which cannot be quickly upgraded to eliminate
known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
Federal government offices are vulnerable
to cyberattacks, with the number of cyber inci-
dents reported by federal agencies increasing
more than 1,300 percent between 2006 and
2015.
In 2015, a hacker exploited access provided
by a government agency contractor to break
into government databases to gain access to
22 million security clearance files from the Of-
fice of Personnel Management.
In 2017, Federal agencies reported more
than 35,000 cyber incidents, some of which
targeted old operating systems that were no
longer supported by a vendor.
According to the National Security Agency,
it has not responded to a zero-day attack on
government systems in the last four years,
largely because hackers have found better
success through basic attack methods.
H.R. 3710 will provide much needed struc-
ture around a federal government wide effort
to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities in fed-
eral civilian agency networks.
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for
H.R. 3710.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.

Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I rise today in support of H.R. 3710,
the Cybersecurity Vulnerability Reme-
diation Act. This bill enables CISA to
develop important mitigation proto-
cols for vulnerabilities existing in out-
dated software and hardware through
collaboration with public- and private-
sector entities.
This important legislation, intro-
duced by Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas,
helps ensure that we maintain security
in our networks.
I support this legislation, and I urge
my colleagues to join me in doing so.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I

Mr. Speaker, let me further explain
what this bill does.
This bill supports the ongoing work
of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity and security civilian agency and
coordinating with private-sector com-
puting network owners and operators.
Most people do not know how long
the Federal Government has used com-
puting to carry out vital functions in
service of the public. The Federal Gov-
ernment’s first use of computing tech-
nology occurred as long ago as 1890,

when an automated tabulation method
was used to organize that year’s Census
data encoded on punch cards.
Let me remind our colleagues that
we are about to venture on to Census
now. Imagine a cyberattack on that
process.
Since a modest beginning in 1890, the
Federal Government has blazed a path
for adoption of computing technology
throughout the Federal Government,
which established an unprecedented
pace for innovation in the private sec-
tor that transformed our world from
analog to digital in 129 years.
One of the consequences of the Fed-
eral Government’s use of computing
technology over the last 129 years is
the challenges of operating legacy sys-
tems that use outdated software, which
cannot be quickly upgraded to elimi-
nate known cybersecurity vulnerabili-
ties.
Federal Government offices are vul-
nerable to cyberattacks, with the num-
ber of cyber incidents reported by Fed-
eral agencies increasing more than
1,300 percent between 2006 and 2015.
In 2015, a hacker exploited access by
a government agency contractor to
break into the government databases
to gain access to 22 million security

sonnel Management.
In 2017, Federal agencies reported
more than 35,000 cyber incidents, some
of which targeted old operating sys-
tems that were no longer supported by
a vendor.
According to the National Security
Agency, it has not responded to a zero-
day attack on government systems in
the last 4 years because hackers have
found better success through basic at-
tack methods.
I would hope my colleagues would
consider recognizing that we must be
in front of these potential attacks and
not behind them.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I urge adoption to the bill, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
want to thank the minority for its sup-
port of this legislation and ask my col-
leagues to support it.
As I do so, Mr. Speaker, I include in
the RECORD an article, ‘‘DHS Flags Cy-
bersecurity Vulnerabilities in Philips
Patient Monitors: The Department of
Homeland Security has issued an advi-
sory about cybersecurity vulnerabili-
ties in the wireless local area network
modules of Philips IntelliVue portable
patient monitors.’’
[Sept. 13, 2019]
DHS FLAGS CYBERSECURITY VULNERABILITIES
IN PHILIPS PATIENT MONITORS
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HAS
ISSUED AN ADVISORY ABOUT CYBERSECURITY
VULNERABILITIES IN THE WIRELESS LOCAL
AREA NETWORK MODULES OF PHILIPS
INTELLIVUE PORTABLE PATIENT MONITORS
(By Fred Donovan)
The Department of Homeland Security has
issued (https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/
icsma-19-255-01) an advisory about cybersecu-
rity vulnerabilities in the wireless local area
network (WLAN) modules of certain Philips
IntelliVue portable patient monitors.
DHS’s Industrial Control Systems Cyber
Emergency Response Team (ICS–CERT)
warned that an attacker could corrupt the
IntelliVue WLAN firmware and alter the
data flow over to the patient monitor, caus-
ing an inoperative condition alert at the de-
vice and central station.
The vulnerable patient monitors are
IntelliVue MP monitors MP20–MP90, MP5/
5SC, MP2/X2, and MX800/700/600.
The vulnerabilities include use of hard-
coded password and download of code with-
out integrity check.
The use of a hard-coded password makes it
easier for an attacker to guess the password
and login via FTP and upload malicious
firmware. In addition, the ‘‘product
downloads source code or an executable from
a remote location and executes the code
without sufficiently verifying the origin and
integrity of the code,’’ warned the advisory.
Shawn Loveric of Finite State reported the
vulnerabilities to Philips.
In a product security advisory (https://
www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/about/cus-
tomer-support/product-security), Philips rec-
ommended that users of the affected
IntelliVue patient monitors update to the
WLAN Module Version C wireless module
with current firmware.
Philips said it will also issue a software
patch for WLAN Version A that will be avail-
able by the end of 2019, while WLAN Version
B is obsolete.
‘‘Wireless network access should be con-
trolled by authentication and authorization
(e.g. WPA2), which are supported by Philips.
Additional mitigations include imple-
menting a firewall rule on the customer
wireless network, and further controls on
physical access to the system,’’ Philips ad-
vised.
Philips said it had received no reports of
patient harm. Its analysis judged that it is
unlikely that the cybersecurity vulner-
ability would impact clinical use, due to
mitigating controls in place. To date, Philips
has received no complaints involving clinical
use that it has been able to associate with
the vulnerability or evidence of patient iden-
tifiers compromised.
DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency recommended users of the
vulnerable Philips devices take defensive
measures to minimize the risk of exploi-
tation of these vulnerabilities. Users should
restrict system access to authorized per-
sonnel and follow a least privilege approach,
apply defense-in-depth strategies, and dis-
able unnecessary accounts and services.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. With that in
mind, this is a real-life example of
what can happen if we are not first in
front.
Mr. Speaker, I hope that my col-
leagues will join me in voting for H.R.
3710, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.

Paragraph (1) of section 201(e) of the Home-
land Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121(e)) is
amended by adding at the end the following
new sentence: ‘‘The Secretary shall also pro-
vide the Chief Intelligence Officer with a
staff having appropriate expertise and expe-
rience to assist the Chief Intelligence Offi-
cer.’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas?
There was no objection.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 2589, the Unifying DHS Intel-
ligence Enterprise Act.
H.R. 2589 seeks to improve the De-
partment of Homeland Security’s intel-
ligence enterprise by ensuring intel-
ligence officers across DHS are sharing
information and countering threats in
a unified manner.
Since the Department was estab-
lished, intelligence and information
sharing capabilities have matured, but
DHS still lacks a coordinated intel-
ligence enterprise.
In 2016, the Committee on Homeland
Security released a comprehensive re-
view of the Department of Homeland
Security’s use of intelligence to
counter terrorist threats and pre-
scribed 30 recommendations.
As a result, this bill directs the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, through
a DHS chief intelligence officer, to de-
velop and disseminate written DHS-
wide guidance for the processing, anal-
ysis, production, and dissemination of
Homeland Security and terrorism in-
formation, and ensures this guidance is
consistent with the protection of pri-
vacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.
Given the diversity of missions
across the Department, it is vital that
component intelligence officers are
working together, sharing information,
and vetting that information against
the broader U.S. intelligence commu-
nity holdings.
H.R. 2589 requires an assessment and
description of how the dissemination of
information to the intelligence com-
munity and Federal law enforcement
assists such entities in carrying out
their respective missions.
One of the key missions of DHS is to
act as a clearinghouse for threat infor-
mation, and this bill will ensure that
the Department continues to evolve
into a better, more effective asset in
responding to threats to the homeland.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 2589, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 2589, the Unifying DHS Intel-
ligence Enterprise Act.
In December of 2003, I had the unbe-
lievable opportunity to fly with our
Nation’s elite special operations avia-
tion unit, the Night Stalkers, in con-
junction with our Army’s tier I coun-
terterrorism unit in the capture of
Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It was
the highlight of my Army career.
Whether it was on missions in Iraq or
hunting Osama bin Laden in Afghani-
stan, I realized that having a system-
atic way to gather, process, analyze,
and disseminate intelligence informa-
tion was critical to our success on the
battlefield. That experience encour-
aged me to introduce this bill back in
May so that DHS can best fulfill its
very important mission to keep Amer-
ica safe.
This bill requires the Department’s
chief intelligence officer, or CINT, to
establish a homeland intelligence doc-
trine for the Department, and it re-
quires the CINT to maintain a dedi-
cated staff.
In the years following the terrorist
attacks of September 11, the Depart-
ment was established to consolidate 22
existing Federal agencies and reshape
the domestic intelligence and counter-
terrorism structure of the U.S.
Over the years, DHS has matured and
refined its intelligence enterprise. Sig-
nificant improvements have been
made, but there is not yet complete
unity among the various intelligence
offices within all the component agen-
cies.
In 2016, the House Committee on
Homeland Security released a com-
prehensive review of the Department’s
use of intelligence to counter terrorist
attacks. They recognized that DHS,
‘‘has improved its ability to protect
the homeland against terrorist threats
over time, but major gaps remain.’’
They prescribed over 30 recommenda-
tions to the Department for improved
intelligence sharing.
The goal of H.R. 2589 is to ensure all
of the component entities at DHS are
speaking the same language, using the
same trade craft, and disseminating
their products to the appropriate
stakeholders, which include both intel-
ligence communities and State and
local partners. This legislation will
help professionalize the DHS intel-
ligence enterprise by establishing a
shared intelligence doctrine.
Across DHS, dedicated border and
immigration agents are gathering in-
formation on individuals seeking to
enter the United States. Threats to
transportation systems and critical in-
frastructure are gathered and assessed,
and real-time cyber threats to the gov-
ernment and private networks are ana-
lyzed.
The incredible differences in the
agencies of the Department create nat-
ural barriers to information flow.
Given this diversity of missions, it is
vital that component intelligence of-
fices are working together, sharing in-
formation, and vetting that informa-
tion against intelligence community
holdings.
As a former member of the Army spe-
cial operations task forces, I know the
value of synchronized intelligence
processes in order to connect the dots
and successfully carry out a mission.
This bill also authorizes the continued
dedication to providing staff to the
chief intelligence officer ensuring that
this distinct mission continues to pro-
vide the value necessary to support the
intelligence enterprise.
I support this legislation, and I urge
my colleagues to join me in doing so.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN) for his
service, and I thank him for this legis-
lation.
It is worth noting that the bill that
we just passed and the bill that we are
now debating specifically dealing with
cybersecurity and intelligence are cru-
cial elements of our security.
I think that with the combination of
recognizing the importance of the in-
telligence community that is on the
front lines of providing our safety and
then acknowledging the vulnerabilities
in the cyber system as one of the com-
ponents of new technology, I started

THOUSANDS OF VULNERABILITIES IN SEATTLE’S
IT NETWORK ATTRIBUTED TO SILOED AP-
PROACH TO CYBERSECURITY
(By David Kroman)
Last May, Seattle’s head of information se-
curity flagged a problem within the city’s
technology department: Because of a process
breakdown, employees were indicating that
they had fixed vulnerabilities in the depart-
ment’s computer network when, in fact, they
had not been fixed.
‘‘It has been discovered that there are cur-
rently over 21,000 known critical and high
vulnerabilities on systems throughout Se-
attle IT,’’ Andrew Whitaker, then the de-
partment’s chief information security offi-
cer, wrote in a May 22 email to technology
leadership. ‘‘Tickets have been closed out,
claiming to have vulnerabilities remediated,
but upon follow-up review they were, with a
few exceptions, not remediated.’’
The result was that the servers, desktops
and applications within the newly consoli-
dated Department of Information Tech-
nology—which now handles the vast major-
ity of the city of Seattle’s technology func-
tions, from utilities to the fire department—
contained open miniportals that could be
accessed by would-be hackers.
When left unremediated, vulnerabilities
provide possible paths for hackers to plant
spyware, ransomware, viruses and other ma-
licious software that can be immensely
harmful to an organization, especially one
that provides critical services. Cities are
often particularly open to an attack and the
effect can be devastating, as recent ransom
attacks in Baltimore and Atlanta have
shown.
Saad Bashir, Seattle’s new head of the De-
partment of Information Technology, said in
an interview that he believes the
vulnerabilities are manageable. He said Se-
attle is at risk, as are all organizations, but,
in general, not abnormally so.
However, Bashir acknowledged the process
breakdown was indicative of a broader prob-
lem (https://crosscut.com/2017/07/at-city-hall-
a-massive-department-is-mired-in-chaos) he
has been attempting to address within the
organization since taking his position earlier
this year. ‘‘What I observed very early was
that there was a siloed approach in how cy-
bersecurity was being practiced in the world
of IT,’’ he said.
Because of a disconnect between teams,
Bashir said, some part of the security proc-
ess would get completed, but would not be
properly handed off to the next team. ‘‘If
you’re not clear, then you may not know
whether that particular vulnerability man-
agement work has been completed the way
it’s supposed to be completed,’’ Bashir said.
In an effort to improve the processes with-
in the department, Bashir began a major re-
organization of the relatively new depart-
ment—including his firing of 14 directors and
managers (https://crosscut.com/2019/05/se-
attles-new-it-boss-fires-14-directors-part-or-
ganizational-change)—just two days before
Whitaker’s message. The reorganization was
not motivated solely by security weaknesses,
he said, but was intended to create a smooth-
er structure that would better catch possible
entry points. When asked if the city was
safer from an attack since he took over,
Bashir said, ‘‘Absolutely.’’
Every organization contains some number
of vulnerabilities. The trick is to continually
identify and address them as they arise—an
e-windshield wiper of sorts, where the
vulnerabilities are the raindrops.
Experts say hackers are increasingly less
likely to gain access through a vulnerability
than they are through a phishing expedition.
In such cases, a deceiving email message per-
suades employees to provide passwords or a
malware-infected USB drive is left in a park-
ing lot in hopes that someone finds it and
plugs it in to their computer.
But addressing vulnerabilities in the city’s
systems continues to be an important func-
tion of its IT department.
‘‘If I were a serious bad guy I’d be looking
at the most vulnerable place,’’ said Dr. Bar-
bara Endicott-Popovsky, executive director
of the Center for Information Assurance &
Cybersecurity at the University of Wash-
ington. ‘‘I’d be looking at cities and I’d be
looking at universities, because they’re open
and they can’t afford the latest and greatest.
It’s kind of like, ‘Open sesame.’ ’’
Mike Hamilton, founder of CI Security and
Seattle’s chief information security officer
from 2006 to 2013, said there are a number of
reasons cities struggle to stay ahead of
cyberattacks.
For one, the number of qualified security
experts is down across the country, he said.
And of those who are on the market, cities
can’t match the pay of large companies like
Amazon or Microsoft.
‘‘The ones that are good are in short sup-
ply, which means that local governments
cannot compete for those resources,’’ he
said.
Additionally, cities are responsible for the
security of all their departments, each of
which may require vastly different things.
‘‘Because government is a federation of
agencies, that makes it a little difficult to
have policies in place that apply to [for ex-
ample] the regulated industry of human re-
sources without raising the ire of unions,’’
he said.
Hamilton also said the biennial budgeting
of local government makes keeping up chal-
lenging. ‘‘Technology moves a whole lot
freaking faster,’’ he said.
All of this, Hamilton said, is in the context
of extremely high stakes. Compared with for-
profit companies, ‘‘the potential impact [of
an attack on government] is so much greater
and government can’t afford it,’’ said Ham-
ilton. ‘‘We know something needs to be fixed,
and we don’t fix it until something blows
up.’’
Bashir said the new processes he’s put into
place has made him ‘‘confident that we no
longer have any glaring process gaps.’’ He
couldn’t say exactly how many
vulnerabilities are still open on city sys-
tems, but that it was less than 21,000. The
ideal number, Bashir said, is zero, but that’s
also extremely unlikely, which makes it
hard to identify what a ‘‘good’’ number is.
‘‘I worry about all of them,’’ said Andrew
Cushman, the city’s new chief security offi-
cer. ‘‘Whether that number is 21,000 or
whether that number is 10 depends on the
attacker and how skilled that attacker is
and how motivated that attacker is. So I
don’t worry more because that number is
21,000, then I do if that number is 10.’’
Going forward, Bashir said he wants ‘‘to
create a high level of security awareness
mindset across the organization.’’ The city
could have zero vulnerabilities and it
wouldn’t matter if one employee plugs in the
wrong USB to a work computer.
Hamilton said there are several easy
things cities can do that, while not offering
total protection, would make it so they are
no longer ‘‘the slowest gnu in the herd get-
ting picked off.’’ For one, mandate zero per-
sonal use of city equipment, something
Singapore implemented in 2017.
Phishing attacks remain the easiest entry
point for hackers and so that’s where the
bulk of the city’s attention should focus,
Hamilton said. Because no matter how many
protections are put into place, ‘‘There is not
now, nor will there ever be, a firewall for
stupid.’’

LEADER OF NEW NSA CYBERSECURITY
DIRECTORATE OUTLINES THREATS, OBJECTIVES
(By Cynthia Brumfield)
Ransomware, Russia, China, Iran and
North Korea are the top cybersecurity
threats that will be the focus of a new divi-
sion within the National Security Agency
(NSA), the Cybersecurity Directorate, which
is set to be operational on October 1, accord-
ing to NSA director of cybersecurity Anne
Neuberger. She was tapped in July by Direc-
tor General Paul Nakasone to head the
group. The Directorate aims to bring the
agency’s foreign intelligence and cyber oper-
ations together and ‘‘operationalize [its]
threat intelligence, vulnerability assess-
ments and cyber defense expertise,’’ the
agency announced when launching the new
division.
‘‘NSA really had to up its game,’’
Neuberger said in a fireside chat with
Niloofar Razi Howe, cybersecurity venture
investor and executive at the Billington Cy-
bersecurity Summit in Washington on Sep-
tember 4. ‘‘And that’s what drove this desire
to stand up a directorate and frankly to set
a pretty aggressive mission, which is to pre-
vent and eradicate cyber actors from na-
tional security systems and critical infra-
structure with a focus on the defense indus-
trial base.’’
In terms of the threats, ‘‘Clearly
ransomware is the focus. We’ve seen there
are roughly 4,000 ransomware attacks a
day,’’ Neuberger said. ‘‘When we look at Rus-
sia, we see a country that uses influence op-
erations, uses cyber [that is] really inte-
grated and below the level of armed conflict.
They also use entities who aren’t necessarily
tied to the government, whether the Internet
Research Agency for potential elections in-
fluence or China has its own unique approach
to how the country uses cyber threats to
achieve its national security and military
objectives, Neuberger said. China’s cyber
threats are exemplified by three different
and wholly distinct types of operations: the
2015 theft of 21.5 million records from the Of-
fice of Personnel Management, the hacking
campaign known as Cloud Hopper that tar-
geted eight of the world’s biggest technology
service providers, and ongoing theft of intel-
lectual property such as when Chinese intel-
ligence and business insiders sought to steal
information related to a turbofan engine
used in commercial airliners.
Iran is very volatile and uses destructive
attacks in its own region primarily,
Neuberger said. ‘‘North Korea always fas-
cinates us as essentially a nation-state

criminal, as a country under sanctions using
creative ways of cyber, whether it’s crypto
currency, whether it’s cryptomining to gain
hard currency and essentially keep the re-
gime afloat.’’
Neuberger previously headed the agency’s
‘‘Russia Small Group,’’ a joint NSA-Cyber
Command task force to combat Russian elec-
tion interference and influence campaigns.
The task force ‘‘was stood up out of a real-
ization that something had dramatically
changed and we had to reboot our approach
as a US government,’’ Neuberger said.
‘‘Now influence operations have been
around since the days of Adam and Eve, but
what really changed was the age of social
media,’’ she said. Not only could an adver-
sary send out broad messaging, but it could
also target disinformation to particular eth-
nic groups, particular elements of a country,
and do it in a ‘‘pretty cheap way ... looking
as if one is an American.’’
‘‘So, we realized that it took a more cre-
ative approach to protect our democracy. In
the Russia Small Group, we worked closely
with the DHS and FBI to ensure that from a
cyber perspective they had all the threat in-
formation we had in a way that can be
quickly actionable’’ Neuberger said. ‘‘We’re
tremendously proud of the work we did be-
tween NSA, Cyber Command, DHS and the
FBI to defend the integrity of our elections
and ensure that every American know that
their vote counted and their vote matters.,’’
referring to the Russia Small Group’s efforts
to protect the 2018 midterm elections.
When it comes to warding off 2020 election
threats, the Directorate will take the same
approach the Russia Small Group applied in
the 2018 elections. ‘‘Ensure there is threat in-
telligence, gain those insights, share that in-
telligence, and be prepared to impose costs
on an adversary who may attempt to influ-
ence our elections,’’ Neuberger said. ‘‘We will
do the same work that we did in 2018 looking
to see who are the actors seeking to shake
confidence in the integrity of our elections,
and share that with the FBI.’’
Ransomware has emerged as a bigger
threat to the election infrastructure than it
has before. The recent shift ransomware
attackers have taken from targeting individ-
uals to targeting entities is ‘‘certainly some-
thing that would make it be a key concern
for the elections. The best protection is the
same security advice we give: ensure one
uses principles of least privilege [and] com-
puters with admin access shouldn’t have ac-
cess to the Internet at all times.’’
Partnering with other government agen-
cies and private sector companies and orga-
nizations will be a major focus of the Direc-
torate. ‘‘Everything we do, we do in partner-
ship with other agencies, with allies around
the world and certainly the private sector
plays a role,’’ Neuberger said, noting that
she wants to unify all the various commu-
nities involved in cybersecurity to enhance
collaboration and focus on the hardest cyber-
security problems.
‘‘Partners are key; they are the root of ev-
erything we can accomplish,’’ she said.
Among the partners the Directorate plans to
include in its efforts are the Department of
Defense, Cyber Command, DHS, the acquisi-
tion community, U.S. allies and certainly
the private the sector. ‘‘The private sector is
often the first indicator of a significant
threat or a significant compromise.’’
The goal is to push out as much unclassi-
fied information as possible and bring to-
gether all the elements that are needed to
quickly identify and head off threats. ‘‘Ideal-
ly, we are sharing the threat information to
prevent an attack, to prevent exploitation
rather than being part of a team that helps
with incident response,’’ Neuberger said.
Although the Directorate doesn’t have a
‘‘moonshot’’ objective as it begins oper-
ations, one goal is to address the ‘‘rampant
abuse of Internet infrastructure,’’ Neuberger
said, particularly protecting the Domain
Name System (DNS), the naming system un-
derlying the Internet which has been subject
to increasing attacks and redirections by
malicious actors.
‘‘DNS is a key way that adversaries use for
command and control for exploitation,’’ she
said. Neuberger would like to see efforts such
as the UK’s NCSC’s Protective Domain Name
System, which was built to thwart the use of
DNS for malware distribution and operation,
more widely used. The Directorate can help
by adding or contributing threat information
to make those services even more effective.
The Directorate can serve to interconnect
these efforts so they could communicate be-
yond internet transactions. ‘‘If we could
achieve that, it would have even broader im-
pact beyond cybersecurity.’’

WHY FOCUSING ON THREAT HUNTING MAY
LEAVE YOU VULNERABLE
(By Bob Shaker)
The cybersecurity threat landscape is be-
coming increasingly complex and crowded,
and with security teams around the world
largely understaffed and facing burnout, ex-
perts are looking for the most efficient way
to combat cybercrime.
One approach that has gained significant
momentum of late is threat hunting—the
proactive searching of threat indicators
within an environment to sniff out highly
advanced cyber threats. In threat hunting,
security analysts search their environment
for known indicators of compromise (IoCs)
and adversary tactics, techniques, and proce-
dures (TTPs)—if any of these are found,
there’s a good chance that an attack is un-
derway.
While threat hunting is a key element of a
robust cybersecurity strategy, many organi-
zations rely too heavily on this approach. A
narrow focus on specific IoCs and TTPs
paints an incomplete picture of the threat
environment and means that the attacks
that don’t bear these hallmarks will get
missed.
In this evolving threat landscape, enter-
prises can’t just rely on threat hunting to
keep their environments secure—they must
broaden their cybersecurity approach, as-
sessing security environments in a more ho-
listic way to better detect advanced and
stealth attacks.
WHY THREAT HUNTING HAS BECOME SO POPULAR
Threat hunting has recently become a
major buzzword in the security industry in
large part because it connotes a cooler, more
technical and more skilled approach to secu-
rity. As a result, security experts are gravi-
tating toward it for career-building opportu-
nities and advancing their security ap-
proach.
While threat hunting might be overhyped,
there are also genuine benefits to the prac-
tice (when done correctly) that help explain
why enterprises are so ready to adopt it.
Threat hunting helps refocus security teams
on emerging threats, since existing security
technologies tend to address things we al-
ready know about.
Actively looking for emerging threats can
mean identifying threats that might be lurk-
ing in the environment—reducing dwell time
and tackling threats before they escalate
and turn into full-blown security breaches.
In addition, adopting threat hunting tac-
tics often leads to discovering visibility gaps
in your current security approach—for exam-
ple, your S3 buckets might not be configured
properly or perhaps some firewall rules got
changed, or maybe you’re able to identify an
employee or group within your organization
that is violating a security policy. Uncover-
ing these poorly managed security solutions
is a useful byproduct of threat hunting.
THE DOWNFALLS OF THREAT HUNTING
However, many organizations rely too
heavily on threat hunting as they are unable
to invest in the required infrastructure, re-
sources and expertise to continually analyze
all activity for possible threats. Often, this
threat hunting is provided by third-party se-
curity companies, as many enterprises either
lack the skills and resources entirely or are
only able dedicate their in-house teams to a
few days of threat hunting a year.
With the major talent gap facing cyberse-
curity, most enterprises simply cannot find
or afford to hire professionals with the re-
quired level of expertise. As a result, many
are turning to managed services offered by
security companies to help close the gap. Ac-
cording to Gartner, by 2024, 25% of organiza-
tions will be using MDR services, up from
less than 5% today.
Threat hunting services often focus almost
exclusively on threats posed by splashy, sexy
attack groups—whether it is notable crimi-
nal APTs or nation state groups. A strong se-
curity program focuses on risk management,
and one of the most important things secu-
rity teams can do is accurately identify the
risks that they are susceptible to, which for
many enterprises isn’t a nation-state attack.
While threat-hunting addresses attacks
that everyone is talking about, the reality is
that many enterprises should be equally—if
not more cognizant—of commodity threats.
While sophisticated threats exist and are im-
portant to defend against through threat
hunting, the majority of threats facing en-
terprises are better addressed through good
security hygiene.
Over-investing in threat hunting can lead
to an incomplete and irregular picture of the
risks enterprises face. In fact, a singular reli-
ance on threat hunting alone means that
many types of attacks will get missed if
you’re not specifically looking for them.
TAKING A HOLISTIC APPROACH
By over-rotating on big name threats, se-
curity teams leave open the possibility that
they are going to miss the obvious. In this
threat environment, security teams can’t af-
ford to drop the ball on the basics—a recent
ESG survey of enterprise cybersecurity lead-
ers revealed that more than three-quarters
(76%) believe that threat detection and inci-
dent response is more difficult today than it
was just two years ago.
To ensure a strong security posture, enter-
prises should take a comprehensive, multi-
faceted approach that goes beyond threat
hunting. As they build out a holistic ap-
proach, they should be sure to:
Collect data on everything they can. Often
when investigating a breach or incident, se-
curity teams find that they don’t have any
evidence because they aren’t collecting and
retaining the right data—it’s usually the ex-
ception when there’s sufficient logging for an
incident. With living off the land attacks in-
creasing (many of which fly under the radar
of traditional logging), it’s ever more impor-
tant that teams don’t skimp on data collec-
tion, as relying on a mixture of sources is
more likely to help you detect threats early
and prevent bad actors from getting in unno-
ticed.
Use multiple security tools and strategies.
We’ve recently seen a trend toward new tech-
nologies like AI and machine learning across
security programs. It’s important to layer
these tools and strategies as they each have
their strengths and weaknesses. To maxi-
mize effectiveness, use a mixture of tools,
methodologies and frameworks that inte-
grate multiple attack and adversary consid-
erations such as MITRE ATT&CK as well as

simple IOCs, rule-based detection, statistical
models, linguistic models, and machine
learning models—and then correlate with
global threat intelligence, validating and
augmenting with human expertise.
Don’t underestimate the importance of hu-
mans. The human side of the investigation is
critical. There is no better computer for de-
tecting, recognizing and responding to
threats than the human mind. While auto-
mated systems have helped advance the se-
curity industry significantly, a true ‘‘eyes on
glass’’ approach to threat detection requires
years of experience and the corresponding in-
tuition of knowing when something is amiss.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I

balance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-

I want to thank Chairman THOMPSON
and Ranking Member ROGERS for sup-

Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous materials on this
measure.

objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of H.R. 3691, the TRANSLATE
Act.
Throughout my travels, I get the op-
portunity to witness and meet families
and visitors from numerous countries,
cultures, and backgrounds traveling
throughout our Nation’s airports.
These families share many of the
same experiences we all share when
traveling using an airplane. They want
to board their flights on time and land
safely at their destination without
undue delay or confusion.
Sadly, signs and other communica-
tions throughout our U.S. airports are
not meeting the needs of all travelers.
Many non-English speakers, inter-
national travelers, and people with vi-
sion or hearing impairments experi-
ence challenges during their travels be-
cause the current signage is not acces-
sible to them.
According to the U.S. Census, over 65
million individuals living in the U.S.
over the age of five speak English not
well or not at all.
No one should have to worry about
missing a flight because they don’t
speak English or have impaired vision
or hearing.
This bill addresses this issue by re-
quiring TSA to make signage, video,
audio, and other online content more
accessible to travelers at major air-
ports who do not speak English as their
primary language.
This bill will make TSA operations
more effective and efficient by helping
to prevent miscommunication between
TSA officers and travelers.
Furthermore, this bill helps ensure
that we maintain a standard of
inclusivity at our airports for residents
and visitors alike.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself as much time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3691, the TRANSLATE Act.
TSA has an important mission to pro-
tect air travel and is responsible for
the security of nearly 440 Federalized
airports. Across these airports, TSA
screens more than 2 million passengers
a day.
To accomplish this mission, TSA re-
lies on materials like signs, websites,
and videos to communicate screening
information to passengers and airport
employees prior to their arrival at TSA
checkpoints.
H.R. 3691 requires TSA to develop and
implement a plan to identify languages
other than English that are primary

communication in those languages at
those same airports.
Also included in the plan will be
steps for TSA to improve communica-
tion with individuals that are hearing
and vision impaired or may experience
other barriers to understanding TSA’s
communication.
Mr. Speaker, I commend Representa-
tive TITUS for her work supporting
TSA’s mission to secure air travel. I
urge support of the bill, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ne-
vada (Ms. TITUS).
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman for yielding and I thank the
Member across the aisle for his bipar-
tisan support.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent
Las Vegas; it is the entertainment cap-
ital of the world.
Last year, almost 50 million people
passed through the gates of McCarran
International Airport in my congres-
sional district. They were tourists,
business travelers, and friends and fam-
ily of my ethnically diverse constitu-
ents. Many of them were from inter-
national airports of destination. They
came from all parts of the world, and
they didn’t speak English.
Yet, much of what TSA commu-
nicates to travelers and transportation
workers is through signs, announce-
ments, and videos that are all in
English.
Let’s be clear. As you have heard the
speakers before me say, you shouldn’t
have to worry about missing a plane at
an airport in the United States just be-
cause you don’t speak English.
That is why I am excited that the
House is passing the TRANSLATE Act,
which I introduced to make sure that
TSA goes the extra mile in Las Vegas
and at airports all across the country
to communicate with the traveling
public. It is a basic courtesy.
I know we all appreciate seeing signs
in English when we are traveling
abroad, so there is no reason we
shouldn’t make U.S. airports as wel-
coming as possible to those who don’t
speak English or who may be visually
impaired.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues
for supporting this bill.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I have no speakers for this, and I
am prepared to close.
Mr. Speaker, I am fully in support of
this bill. Again, I want to just give ac-
colades to the gentlewoman who put it
together and recognize that this is fan-
tastic, and we need to get it done.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3691 will make
traveling easier for millions of airline
passengers traveling throughout the
United States whose primary language
is not English.
By creating signage that meets the
needs of all travelers, this bill will im-
prove the travel experience for many.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 3691, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
CORREA) that the House suspend the

TRUSTED TRAVELER RECONSIDER-
ATION AND RESTORATION ACT
OF 2019
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 3675) to require a review of De-
partment of Homeland Security trust-
ed traveler programs, and for other
purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 3675
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Trusted
Traveler Reconsideration and Restoration
Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW.
Not later than one year after the date of
the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller
General of the United States shall conduct a
review of Department of Homeland Security
trusted traveler programs. Such review shall
examine the following:
(1) The extent to which the Department of
Homeland Security tracks data and monitors
trends related to trusted traveler programs,
including root causes for identity-matching
errors resulting in an individual’s enroll-
ment in a trusted traveler program being re-
instated.
(2) Whether the Department coordinates
with the heads of other relevant Federal,
State, local, Tribal, or territorial entities re-
garding redress procedures for disqualifying
offenses not covered by the Department’s
own redress processes but which offenses im-
pact an individual’s enrollment in a trusted
traveler program.
(3) How the Department may improve indi-
viduals’ access to reconsideration procedures
regarding a disqualifying offense for enroll-
ment in a trusted traveler program that re-
quires the involvement of any other Federal,
State, local, Tribal, or territorial entity.
(4) The extent to which travelers are in-
formed about reconsideration procedures re-
garding enrollment in a trusted traveler pro-
gram.
SEC. 3. ENROLLMENT REDRESS.
Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, the Secretary of Homeland Security
shall, with respect to an individual whose en-
rollment in a trusted traveler program was
revoked in error extend by an amount of
time equal to the period of revocation the
period of active enrollment in such a pro-
gram upon re-enrollment in such a program
by such an individual.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. CORREA) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3675, the Trusted Traveler Re-
consideration and Restoration Act of
2019.
Millions of people have applied for a
variety of DHS Trusted Traveler Pro-
grams such as TSA’s PreCheck pro-
gram and CBP’s Global Entry, Nexus,
Sentri, and FAST programs.
Once approved, enrollment in these
programs allows travelers to go
through expedited screening while al-
lowing DHS officers to focus on higher
risk travelers.
While I commend DHS for taking
steps to focus on high-risk travelers, I
am troubled by examples of travelers
who meet all the security requirements
for enrollment but are unable to enroll.
Misidentification or misinformation
impairs DHS’ ability to appropriately
make determinations on eligibility and
limits the public’s willingness to par-
ticipate in these programs.
This bill seeks to strengthen the DHS
Trusted Traveler Programs by requir-
ing the GAO to conduct a study of
them. Specifically, the bill requires
GAO to evaluate the identity matching
process as well as the redress process
for individuals who believe they have
been wrongly disqualified from these
programs.
Such a review will help ensure that
the Trusted Traveler Programs are
working more efficiently and that indi-
viduals seeking to participate are sub-
ject to consistent processes that ensure
fair treatment for all.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3675, the Trusted Traveler Re-
consideration and Restoration Act of
2019.
This bill, sponsored by my colleague,
Representative JOHN KATKO, seeks to
ensure the rights of travelers who have
erroneously had their trusted traveler
status revoked.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative
KATKO for his leadership on this bipar-
tisan bill, and for Chairman THOMPSON
and Ranking Member ROGERS’ commit-
ment to bringing this bill to the floor
today.

September 26, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I also
want to thank Mr. KATKO for his lead-
ership on this measure.
I have no more speakers, and I am
prepared to close after the gentleman

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of

Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman
from New York (Mr. KATKO).
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in strong support of my bill, H.R.
3675, the Trusted Traveler Reconsider-
ation and Restoration Act of 2019.
This bipartisan legislation seeks to
improve the process of having one’s
trusted traveler status reinstated after
it may have been revoked in error.
Every day, the Department of Home-
land Security’s Trusted Traveler Pro-
grams keep the traveling public mov-
ing freely and securely. The Trusted
Traveler Programs, like PreCheck,
Global Entry, Nexus, and Sentri, facili-
tate growing passenger volumes at air-
ports and ports of entry while also
making screening risk-based.
Unfortunately, however, some trav-
elers have suffered from instances of
miscommunication or misidentifica-
tion, causing them to lose their trusted
traveler status.
Unlike the Department’s redress pro-
gram for individuals who are originally
denied enrollment in these programs,
the process for restoration when some-
one’s trusted traveler status has been
erroneously revoked is much less clear.
The traveling public should not be
subjected to a litany of bureaucratic
hurdles and lengthy procedures at mul-
tiple different agencies when seeking
help having their trusted traveler sta-
tus reinstated.
H.R. 3675 helps alleviate this burden
by implementing a top-to-bottom audit
of the Department’s existing data and
processes by the Government Account-
ability Office.
It is my intention that this review
will yield recommendations for Home-
land Security to improve how travelers
engage with the government on these
issues, and break down communication
barriers between Federal, State, and
local agencies.
Importantly, my legislation also di-
rects the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity to provide commensurate re-en-
rollment time to those individuals
found to have had their trusted trav-
eler status revoked in error.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my
bill’s bipartisan cosponsors, including
my friends, Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN, Mr.
CORREA, and Ms. SLOTKIN for their sup-
port of this important bill. I also thank
the chairman of the full committee,
Mr. THOMPSON, and Ranking Member
ROGERS for bringing this bill to the
floor today.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues
to support this legislation.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I reaffirm my support for the bill. I
have no further speakers, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, our citizens expect that
DHS’ Trusted Traveler Programs are
operated in a consistent manner and
that DHS properly identifies those in-
dividuals that are low-risk travelers.
This bill will provide insight into
DHS’ identity matching process and
ensure that individuals seeking to par-
ticipate are subject to consistent proc-
esses that ensure fair treatment.
We also want DHS to focus its time
and resources on individuals who are
high risk. This bill will ensure that the
programs that DHS uses to vet individ-
uals are executed effectively.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
from New York (Mr. KATKO) for intro-
ducing this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I urge the bill’s passage,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8022 September 26, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3694, the Helping Families Fly
Act.
Traveling through the airport can be
a stressful time for many of our trav-
elers. Pregnant women and families
with young children sometimes experi-
ence more difficulty when traveling,
especially during the screening proc-
ess.
TSA’s current screening procedures
must be improved to ensure that these
families are supported and have an
easier experience flying through Amer-
ica’s airports.
This bill will improve the screening
process for pregnant women and their
families by requiring security per-
sonnel to undergo training specific to
the concerns and needs of these specific
travelers.
Additionally, this legislation re-
quires TSA to increase awareness of se-
curity procedures and guidelines by
utilizing various forms of communica-
tion to keep families informed of the
different options they may have during
the screening process. This includes
providing passengers, upon request,
support specialists for women and fam-
ilies and adequate opt-out options to
allow passengers to undergo alter-
native screening procedures.
In short, this bill helps to improve
TSA operations and support the mil-
lions of pregnant women and young
families who travel throughout our Na-
tion’s airports.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of H.R. 3694, the Helping Fami-
lies Fly Act, sponsored by my friend
and colleague from Arizona, Represent-
ative LESKO.
H.R. 3694 requires TSA to implement
a number of reforms aimed at improv-
ing the travel experience for pregnant
women and families with young chil-
dren, including specific assistance by
TSA officers at checkpoints and new
training for officers.
Representative LESKO’s bill will en-
sure that TSA works closely with
transportation stakeholders to make
pregnant travelers and families aware
of screening procedures and options for
assistance.
This good-government bill recognizes
that TSA is oftentimes seen as the face
of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, screening more than 2 million
passengers a day. As such, it is incum-
bent upon the agency to ensure its
services are working for all travelers.
H.R. 3694 will improve the passenger
experience for pregnant women and
families with young children. I urge
my colleagues to support this bill, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I have no
more speakers, and I am prepared to
close after the gentleman from Ten-
nessee closes.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 5 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO).
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Tennessee for
yielding me the time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of my bipartisan legislation,
H.R. 3694, the Helping Families Fly
Act.
I believe strongly that TSA’s pas-
senger screening checkpoints should be
a family-friendly environment. Air-
ports can already be stressful places for
the traveling public, and that stress
can be exacerbated for expecting moth-
ers or families traveling with young
children.
That is why I introduced this bill,
which directs TSA to train frontline
personnel on how to appropriately ad-
dress traveler concerns related to
screening technologies and opt-out pro-
cedures.
Additionally, H.R. 3694 seeks to im-
prove the passenger screening process
by increasing the availability of front-
line TSA personnel and passenger sup-
port specialists for pregnant women
and families with young children.
Moreover, my legislation requires
TSA to communicate across its various
media platforms, and in partnership
with transportation stakeholders, any
improvements, procedures, changes, or
services relevant to pregnant women
and families with young children.
Lastly, H.R. 3694 will examine wheth-
er certain checkpoints may accommo-
date dedicated family-friendly screen-
ing lanes, which will improve the expe-
rience for traveling families while also
improving the operation across all
checkpoint lanes.
Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member
of the Transportation and Maritime
Security Subcommittee, as well as a
mother and grandmother, I believe
that we should be holding TSA ac-
countable in how it interacts with the
traveling public and facilitates the effi-
cient and effective screening of pas-
sengers who are pregnant and traveling
with young families.
I thank the chairman of the Trans-
portation and Maritime Security Sub-
committee, Representative CORREA, for
his bipartisan support of this legisla-
tion. We don’t always have a lot of that
here, so I am very thankful that we
were able to agree on this bill.
Additionally, I thank Chairman
THOMPSON and Ranking Member ROG-
ERS for their work to bring this bill to
the floor today and all the bill’s co-
sponsors.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous materials on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, every day, in commu-
nities across this country, synthetic
opioids kill Americans in shocking
numbers. H.R. 3722 will take a step for-
ward by addressing this epidemic,
which is one of the most severe ever
facing our country.
The opioid crisis, having already
claimed hundreds of thousands of
American lives over the past two dec-
ades, has evolved into a new and even
more dangerous phase.
The first periods of the crisis were
characterized by the overuse of pre-
scription opioids and heroin. Dev-
astating as these stages were, the cur-
rent phase is even more deadly still.
Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids
are coming into our country from lab-
oratories in China and Mexico and are
wreaking havoc on communities across
the entire country. These extremely
potent chemicals frequently cross our
borders through legal channels such as
international mail facilities, some-
times in small packages, and are dif-
ficult to detect or interdict. The bill
now before us aims to address part of
this challenge.
The Joint Task Force to Combat
Opioid Trafficking Act, sponsored by
Representative JIM LANGEVIN, passed
through the House on a voice vote dur-
ing the 115th Congress before stalling
in the Senate. This Congress, the bill,
once again, passed out of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security with
unanimous consent.
The core of this bill will require the
Department of Homeland Security to
stand up a joint task force dedicated to
preventing synthetic opioids from
reaching our borders. The joint task
force model allows DHS to ensure that
the strengths and capabilities of its
various components are all leveraged
to maximum effect.
Steps such as improved screening
procedures, greater targeting of sus-
picious senders, and better informa-
tion-sharing processes can all aid our
law enforcement agencies in halting
the ongoing flow of synthetic opioids
across our borders.
Unlike the existing authority gov-
erning DHS joint task forces, this bill
will allow DHS and the private sector
the opportunity to collaborate on this
challenge. Private-sector partners also
have strengths and capabilities that
can greatly enhance joint efforts to
prevent legitimate commercial activi-
ties from being exploited by bad actors.
The crisis at hand requires innova-
tive solutions. A greater focus on in-
creased collaboration between DHS, its
components, and private-sector part-
ners all could go a long way in address-
ing a major driver of this crisis.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in
support of H.R. 3722.
The opioid epidemic continues to
devastate communities across this Na-
tion. Approximately 115 Americans die
every single day from an opioid over-
dose. Opioid abuse doesn’t discrimi-
nate. It touches people from every age
group, race, class, gender, background,
and economic status.
b 1430
Some Americans become addicted
after taking doctor-prescribed doses for
an injury or a surgery, while others try
them in illicit forms and become de-
pendent.
Another disturbing trend we are see-
ing is illicit drugs being laced with
fentanyl, which is 100 times more pow-
erful than morphine, frequently lead-
ing to accidental overdose.
We have seen estimates concluding
that more than 2 million of our fellow
Americans are addicted to opioids, and,
as a physician, I have seen lives dev-
astated, families disrupted and often
destroyed as the addict’s behavior
drives them to horrific acts.
As we work to confront this epi-
demic, we must prevent overprescrip-
tion, stop the illicit flow into the
United States, and treat those Ameri-
cans who have become addicted.
This bill would authorize a joint task
force within the Department of Home-
land Security to organize opioid inter-
diction efforts across multiple compo-
nents and agencies in a unity-of-effort
campaign. It would also leverage do-
mestic and international partners to
provide a multifaceted approach to
tackling the issue.
Most illicit opioids are produced in
China and smuggled by mail, where
vulnerabilities in the postal system are
exploited. U.S. Customs and Border
Protection is also seeing increased
traffic from Mexico with opioids hidden
in vehicles and cargo entering through
the U.S. ports.
The joint task force approach to the
opioid epidemic is effective because it
fosters information sharing and ex-
change between all relevant stake-
holders to combat the opioid epidemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8024 September 26, 2019
While there are no quick or easy so-
lutions to this epidemic, H.R. 3722 is a
step in the right direction. I support
this bill, and I encourage my col-
leagues to do the same.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode
Island (Mr. LANGEVIN).
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
3722, the Joint Task Force to Combat
Opioid Trafficking Act of 2019.
Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a
public health emergency that has dev-
astated communities across the coun-
try, including in my home State of
Rhode Island.
No matter your race, gender, age, or
religion, Americans are suffering from
the opioid overdose epidemic. In 2017,
approximately 47,600 fatalities were at-
tributed to opioid overdose.
Fentanyl is exacerbating the prob-
lem. This powerful, synthetic opioid, 25
to 50 times stronger than heroin and 50
to 100 times more powerful than mor-
phine, caused more than 15 times more
deaths in 2017 than in 2009.
The majority of opioids interdicted
by the United States law enforcement
agencies are seized at ports of entry. In
fact, the southern border accounts for
at least 75 percent of all opioids col-
lected.
I am pleased to offer a solution with
my colleagues, Mr. KING from New
York, Mr. ROSE, and Mr. MCCAUL, that
will strengthen the Department of
Homeland Security’s fight against the
drug crisis.
This bill authorizes the Secretary of
Homeland Security to establish a task
force to enhance the internal integra-
tion of the Department’s border secu-
rity operations to detect, interdict, dis-
rupt, and prevent narcotics, including
fentanyl, from entering the United
States in the first place.
Secretary Johnson was the first to
use the joint task force model to
achieve better unity of effort across
the Department’s components.
All of DHS’ many agencies, from Cus-
toms and Border Protection to the
United States Coast Guard, have an
important role to play when it comes
to combating opioid trafficking. So if
the Homeland Security investigations
are looking into a fentanyl distribution
ring, for example, in Omaha, they need
to coordinate efforts with Customs of-
fices in El Paso so that packages en
route to Nebraska are properly inter-
dicted.
The JTF model is intended to ensure
this coordination is baked into the cul-
ture of DHS so that cases don’t slip
through the cracks. Congress recog-
nized the value of Secretary Johnson’s
pilot JTFs when we formally author-
ized them in 2016.
As new challenges confront the De-
partment, we must make use of this or-
ganizational structure in innovative
ways to maintain the synergies that
drove the creation of DHS in the first
place.
Stopping proliferation of fentanyl is
particularly well-suited to the JTF ap-
proach. Unlike many more traditional
narcotics, fentanyl is often shipped di-
rectly to dealers from overseas.
Fentanyl’s extremely high potency al-
lows these shipments to be small
enough to go undetected unless care-
fully scrutinized. That is why it is es-
sential that the joint task force on
opioids collaborate with private-sector
organizations and any other Federal,
State, local, Tribal, territorial, or
international entity to increase oper-
ational effectiveness, coordination, and
information sharing.
We need to work with partners, espe-
cially the United States Postal Service
and private parcel delivery services
like UPS and FedEx to ensure sus-
picious packages are inspected. Having
a single task force coordinating the De-
partment’s efforts makes it much easi-
er for other organizations to know
whom to call.
So this crisis gripping our Nation is,
obviously, very complex. We cannot
succeed in stemming the opioid epi-
demic unless the Federal Government
recognizes the opportunity to integrate
and collaborate—not only across agen-
cies, but also with our private-sector
partners.
So like every bill that makes its way
to the floor, this legislation is a result,
of course, of a collaborative effort. I
have to begin by thanking former Sen-
ator Claire McCaskill, who has been a
true championship in driving policy to
address the opioid crisis and who first
proposed applying the JTF model to
this epidemic.
I must also thank my good friend,
longtime colleague on the committee,
and cosponsor, Congressman PETER
KING, who is helping ensure that this
effort is a bipartisan one; Mr. MCCAUL,
who helped get this bill to the last Con-
gress; and, of course, Mr. ROSE, who
has been a real champion in helping to
combat the opioid crisis and who has
had an immediate impact fighting
opioids since he came to Congress ear-
lier this year.
I am grateful also to Chairman
THOMPSON for his continued leadership
on using all of the powers of DHS to
combat this epidemic.
Like anything we do, nothing would
have been possible, of course, without
tireless staff work, and particularly
that of Rosaline Cohen and Alex Carnes
with the committee; my legislative di-
rector, Nick Leiserson; and also Elyssa
Malin, a former staffer in my office.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman
from Rhode Island.
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding me
the additional time.
As I said before, the opioid epidemic
is increasingly complex, with a number
of factors driving the tragic increases
in overdose. There is no silver bullet;
rather, we need a whole-of-society ap-
proach. This bill will bring that unity
of effort to the Department of Home-
land Security so that it can be a more
effective partner in turning the tide
against opioid abuse.
I hope all of my colleagues will join
me in supporting the creation of a joint
task force on opioids and support this
bill.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I have no further speakers for the
bill. I renew my support, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, our country faces a se-
vere and ongoing crisis, with newly de-
veloped synthetic opioids causing tre-
mendous suffering to our families, indi-
viduals, and entire communities
throughout the country. The collabora-
tion between private companies and
the government that will be possible
through this legislation will prove to
be a crucial component in the task of
stopping the flow of fentanyl across
our borders.
H.R. 3722 is a bipartisan and targeted
solution to address this most urgent
need. I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
CORREA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3722.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and to include ex-
traneous materials on this measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3246, the Traveling Parents
Screening Consistency Act.
The stress of traveling through our
airport checkpoints is very familiar to
all of us. This experience can be espe-
cially burdensome on parents traveling
with children. Too often, these families
aren’t given clear direction and guid-
ance on how to ensure that they meet
TSA guidelines while bringing baby
supplies and nursing products through
the screening process.
Parents across the country are often
left confused and inconvenienced as
they encounter different interpreta-
tions of TSA’s policies at different air-
ports. In some cases, parents have dis-
carded expensive baby formula and
other items after being instructed that
such items cannot be brought through
security when, in fact, they are allowed
under TSA policy.
TSA must do better for these fami-
lies by creating commonsense policies
and clearly communicating with them
to ensure parents are able to properly
care for their children while traveling.
H.R. 3246, provides more certainty
and protections to parents traveling
with baby supplies, such as breast milk
and formula. This bill will help im-
prove traveling experiences for fami-
lies, while enforcing security standards
for everyone traveling throughout our
Nation’s airports.
I urge my House colleagues to sup-
port this legislation, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3246, the Traveling Parent
Screening Consistency Act, introduced
by Representative VAN TAYLOR.
As many of us can attest, the life of
a parent with young or infant children
can be quite stressful, particularly
while traveling. Screening by the
Transportation Security Administra-
tion at airports can make this even
more stressful with inconsistent
screening requirements for the essen-
tials like formula, breast milk, deion-
ized water, and juice.
This bill seeks to address any poten-
tial inconsistency in screening require-
ments by requiring the Government
Accountability Office to conduct a re-
view to determine if TSA needs to up-
date or revise its protocols for screen-
ing and information sharing.
In addition to this determination,
the GAO will also assess how pas-
sengers’ complaints are monitored for
trends and will include recommenda-
tions for how TSA can improve its
practices for screening these items.
I would like commend Representa-
tive TAYLOR for his work on this legis-
lation that addresses an issue brought
to him by one of his constituents and
is, likely, experienced by many new
parents.
H.R. 3246 will be a tremendous ben-
efit to the passenger experience for new
families, and I urge my colleagues to
support this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I have no
more speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. TAYLOR).
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of my legislation,
H.R. 3246, the Traveling Parents
Screening Consistency Act.
As a new Member of Congress, I en-
deavor to listen to my constituents. As
a new Member, I have actually had
over 300 individual meetings with my
constituents in the last 8 months. I
have had 24 Coffees with Your Con-
gressman.
One of my constituents, a mother
from Fairview, Texas, took advantage
of this Coffee with Your Congressman
opportunity and came and told me
about her problems that she was hav-
ing with TSA as a new mother trying
to get her breast milk through to feed
her child.
b 1445
This I realized was a problem not just
for her, but many mothers across my
district and really many mothers
across this entire country. I have heard
story after story, as I have worked on
this legislation, telling about how the
TSA is just not consistent with how
they are applying their rules.
So this bill seeks to create clear and
consistent rules that parents can un-
derstand as they travel our Nation’s
airports. This is important legislation
to help streamline that very important
process to both keep us safe and make
it easy to travel.
I want to thank my colleague very
much from across the aisle, Congress-
woman RICE. I appreciate the leader-
ship of Chairman THOMPSON and Rank-
ing Member ROGERS, and I also want to
thank Senator MCSALLY for carrying
this piece of legislation in the other
Chamber.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to, hope-
fully, passing this today, and I urge my
colleagues to support H.R. 3246.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I have no further speakers on the
bill. I renew my support. I recommend
my colleagues support this bill, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3246
aims to ensure that families receive
consistent information regarding the
screening process for baby supplies and
nursing products. This bill will enable
parents to properly prepare the sup-
plies necessary to care for their chil-
dren when traveling while ensuring
passenger security through the screen-
ing process.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. TAYLOR for
this fine piece of legislation, I urge my
colleagues to support this bill, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

211(g)(4)(C)), as added by section 2 of this
Act. Such briefings may be provided in a
classified setting if the Commissioner deter-
mines such is appropriate.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. CORREA) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous materials on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of H.R. 3526, the Counter Ter-
rorist Network Act. Customs and Bor-
der Protection, or CBP, is charged with
the important mission of securing our
Nation’s borders and ports of entries
against a range of threats, including
foreign terrorist networks. In pursuit
of this mission, it is vital that CBP and
the Department of Homeland Security
collaborate with international partners
to effectively prevent foreign terrorists
from carrying out attacks on U.S. soil.
H.R. 3526 authorizes CBP’s National
Targeting Center, or NTC, to collabo-
rate with international partners to dis-
rupt and dismantle foreign terrorist
networks. The NTC uses technology
and analytical tools to identify threats
and share this information with domes-
tic and international partners.
This bill seeks to solidify CBP’s col-
laboration with international partners
outside of our borders. The Counter
Terrorist Network Act will authorize
CBP to assign NTC personnel abroad to
perform critical information-sharing
operations in real time to ensure that
individuals who are known or sus-
pected of being associated with ter-
rorist networks are prevented from en-
tering the United States.
Even as Congress addresses the rise
of domestic terrorism, we must con-
tinue to be vigilant of the threats
posed by foreign terrorist organiza-
tions such as al-Qaida and the Islamic
State. H.R. 3526 underscores this by au-
thorizing CBP to counter terrorist and
criminal networks from exploiting le-
gitimate avenues to enter the United
States.
Due to its border security mission,
CBP is uniquely situated to combat
these threats that originate from ter-
rorist and criminal networks around
the globe. This bill will allow Congress
to work with CBP to ensure our bor-
ders are secure in a proven and effec-
tive manner.
I thank the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for introducing
this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 3526.
The men and women in uniform at
U.S. Customs and Border Protection
are tasked with an incredibly impor-
tant mission. Every day they protect
our Nation from transnational crimi-
nal organizations, human traffickers,
and terrorists who wish to exploit vul-
nerabilities at our Nation’s borders. To
execute this critical mission, CBP has
developed a cadre of subject matter ex-
perts who are well-versed in counter
criminal network operations. These ex-
perts work tirelessly at our seaports,
airports, and land border crossings
honing their skills, stopping the flow of
illicit goods and people, and creating
actionable intelligence.
Given that CBP is uniquely posi-
tioned on our Nation’s front line, it is
alarming that the CBP does not have
the authority to participate in coun-
terterrorist network activities both do-
mestically and internationally. CBP
lacks the statutory authority to assign
personnel to such specialized details
and liaison assignments with a na-
tional security force.
H.R. 3526 corrects this deficiency by
giving the commissioner of CBP the
statutory authority to assign personnel
to these specialized task forces and col-
laborate with appropriate Federal,
State, local, and Tribal entities to dis-
rupt and dismantle transnational
criminal organizations and foreign ter-
rorist networks.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3526 will lead to
enhanced information sharing and an
increase in intelligence-driven enforce-
ment operations. I encourage my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. UNDERWOOD).
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in support of H.R. 3526, the
Counter Terrorist Network Act. I in-
troduced the bipartisan Counter Ter-
rorist Network Act with my colleague
from New York, Representative KATKO,
to ensure that the Department of
Homeland Security has the tools it
needs to work effectively with inter-
national partners to prevent foreign
terrorist organizations from carrying
out attacks on U.S. soil.
As we work to address growing
threats posed by domestic terrorism,
we must also remain vigilant against
the threats posed by al-Qaida and its
affiliates, the Islamic State, and other
foreign terrorist organizations that as-
pire to do our Nation harm.
With the Counter Terrorist Network
Act, law enforcement will have en-
hanced resources to help thwart
threats to our country. The Counter
Terrorist Network Act authorizes the
National Targeting Center, which is
housed within U.S. Customs and Border
Protection, to collaborate with inter-
national security agencies to disrupt
and dismantle terrorist networks.
Importantly, it authorizes CBP to as-
sign National Targeting Center per-
sonnel to overseas posts to improve in-
formation sharing about terrorist net-
works and help prevent entry to the
U.S. by travelers who are known or
suspected of being associated with a
terrorist network.
NTC—that is the National Targeting
Center—personnel play an important
role in the safety of our country, in-
cluding my community in northern Il-
linois. We know that in fiscal year 2015,
CBP was able to prevent 22,000 high-
risk travelers from traveling to the
U.S. through the collaboration between
the NTC and other predeparture
screening programs. This number rep-
resents previously unknown high-risk
travelers who were found to pose a na-
tional security or terrorist threat.
The successful partnerships and pro-
grams that CBP has built with other
law enforcement partners in further-
ance of their antiterrorism and home-
land security mission warrant congres-
sional support. As we work to address
growing threats posed by domestic ter-
rorism, we must also remain vigilant
against the threats posed by al-Qaida
and its affiliates, the Islamic State,
and other foreign terrorist organiza-
tions that continue to aspire to do our
Nation harm.

support the Counter Terrorist Network
Act.
Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to
thank Chairman THOMPSON and his
staff on the House Committee on
Homeland Security for all of their in-
valuable work on this legislation.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I have no speakers on this bill. I
renew my recommendation that my
colleagues support this bill, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, 18 years after the most
devastating terrorist attack on our
country, it is imperative that DHS con-
tinue its efforts to prevent foreign ter-
rorist organizations from carrying out
attacks on our homeland. By passing
H.R. 3526 today, Congress can ensure
that DHS continues to address border
or homeland security threats long be-
fore they are present at our borders.
I would also note that last Congress,
the House overwhelmingly passed simi-
lar legislation in a bipartisan manner.
It was approved by a vote of 410–2. I
would hope that my colleagues would
again lend their support and join me in
passing this legislation today.
I want to thank Ms. UNDERWOOD for
this most important and timely piece
of legislation to protect our homeland
from terrorists.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
CORREA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3526.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

all Members may have 5 legislative
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.

Terrorism DATA Act.
El Paso. Poway. Pittsburgh. Char-
lottesville. Charleston. Oak Creek.
In the last 7 years, these great Amer-
ican cities have found themselves in-
voluntarily linked by the horror of do-
mestic terrorism.
b 1500
Just last year, in 2018, there were 50
extremist killings in the United States.
Every single one had links to rightwing
extremism, mostly white supremacist
extremism.
Between 2009 and 2018, there were 427
deaths linked to extremism in Amer-
ica. Nearly three-fourths of those were
linked to domestic rightwing extrem-
ists, as compared to the less than one-
fourth linked to Islamist extremists.
The Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity has tackled the challenge of under-
standing and preventing domestic ter-
rorism head-on. In May of this year,
the committee held its first-ever hear-
ing on domestic terrorism while we
took testimony from the FBI, DHS,
and the Justice Department on white
supremacist and other domestic ter-
rorism movements.
Since then, the committee has broad-
ened its oversight of domestic ter-
rorism by not only weaving it into our
traditional work with respect to for-
eign terrorist groups but also by focus-
ing on how social media platforms are
exploited to recruit, plan, and carry
out terrorist attacks.
All along, the committee has given
special attention to the challenges as-
sociated with keeping places of worship
and other public spaces secure in a cur-
rent terrorism climate by, among other
things, holding roundtables in Jackson,
Mississippi, and Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-
vania.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here to
present H.R. 3106, a bill that was ap-
proved by the committee on a bipar-
tisan basis to improve the Federal re-
sponse to domestic terrorism.
Today, Americans have a sense that
domestic terrorism threats are signifi-
cant but have not been presented with
the full-threat picture. There is some
information available to the public,
but it is limited. Americans have
learned, for example, there were more
arrests tied to domestic terrorism than
to international terrorism in 2017 and
2018.
In May, the FBI revealed that it had
around 850 active domestic terrorism
investigations across the country. As
of July, according to the FBI, the num-
ber of domestic terrorism arrests in
2019 is on par with the number of inter-
national terrorism arrests.

great service by collecting and pub-
lishing data on the threat of extremist
violence in the United States.
My bill would require the FBI, the
Justice Department, and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to publish
an annual report on terrorism. Enact-
ment of this legislation would help
Americans understand, over time, the
nature of the terrorism threat and how
it is evolving.
Importantly, the legislation also re-
quires Federal agencies to share infor-
mation on how the government is keep-
ing us safe. We need to know how many
staff are on the job and how many ter-
rorism-related investigations, indict-
ments, prosecutions, and convictions
there have been.
The bill has been endorsed by the
Anti-Defamation League, the Arab
American Institute, the Jewish Federa-
tions of North America, the Lawyers’
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law,
the Leadership Conference on Civil and
Human Rights, the Muslim Advocates,
the NAACP, the National Action Net-
work, and the Southern Poverty Law
Center.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
endorsement letters from the following
organizations: the Anti-Defamation
League, the NAACP, the Arab Amer-
ican Institute, the Jewish Federations
of North America; the Lawyers’ Com-
mittee for Civil Rights Under Law, and
the Southern Poverty Law Center.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We are writing to
urge you to support H.R. 3106, the Domestic
Terrorism Documentation and Analysis of
Threats in America Act, or the Domestic
Terrorism DATA Act, which we have en-
dorsed.
The ADL (Anti-Defamation League) is a
leading anti-hate organization and has been
working to secure justice and fair treatment
to all since its founding in 1913. As part of
our mandate, we have been compiling and
analyzing comprehensive domestic terrorism
data for years. We use this data to inves-
tigate the threat of extremist groups and do-
mestic terrorism, work with law enforce-
ment to help keep our communities safe
from those threats, and inform debates about
how to shape policy. ADL has long found
that data collection is essential to effec-
tively counter hate and extremism in all
forms. Without transparency, collective ef-
forts, and comprehensive data collection, ad-
vocacy and solutions are not possible.
Our data show that threats against Jews,
Muslims, and other minorities in the United
States are at disturbingly high levels, and a
key reason for that is the resurgence of
white supremacist ideologies. ADL’s latest
report on extremist-related murders, Murder
and Extremism in the United States in 2018,
found that 78% of the 50 murders committed
by extremists in 2018 were tied specifically to
white supremacy. The ten-year overview
tells a similar story: Of the 313 people killed
by right-wing extremists between 2009 to
2018, 76% were killed by white supremacists,
making white supremacists the deadliest ex-
tremist movement in the United States over
the past decade.
The proliferation of hate and the dan-
gerous ideology of white supremacy puts our
communities at risk. From Charlottesville
to Pittsburgh to Poway, American commu-
nities are under attack. In a time of crisis
such as this, one might expect a complete
overhaul of the priorities, policies, and re-
sources that the U.S. government brings to
bear to counter and prevent this ideology
from claiming its next victims. Instead,
Americans have been met with an abdication
of that duty, while the government, in fact,
has reduced resources to counter domestic
terrorism, leaving our communities more
vulnerable to the next inevitable tragedy.
The Domestic Terrorism Documentation
and Analysis of Threats in America Act fo-
cuses on increasing the coordination, ac-
countability, and transparency of the federal
government in collecting and recording data
on domestic terrorism. H.R. 3106 would Re-
quire FBI, DOJ, and DHS to produce an an-
nual, unclassified joint report that provides
the following: data on domestic terrorist in-
cidents; assessments, investigations, indict-
ments, prosecutions, and convictions with a
domestic terrorism nexus; the number of
full-time staff working on domestic ter-
rorism employed by DOJ and DHS, as well as
a new requirement for the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) to audit the an-
nual joint reports.
Data drives policy; we cannot address what
we are not measuring. Collecting accurate
and transparent data on domestic terrorism
is an essential way to ensure this threat to
American democracy receives the attention
it deserves. That is why we urge you to sup-
port the Domestic Terrorism DATA Act.
Sincerely,
ERIKA MORITSUGU,
Vice President,
Government Relations, Advocacy and
Community Engagement.

Re: NAACP Strong Support for H.R. 3106, the
‘‘Domestic Terrorism Documentation
and Analysis of Threats in America Act’’
DEAR CONGRESSMAN THOMPSON: On behalf
of the NAACP, our nation’s oldest, largest
and most widely-recognized grassroots-based
civil rights organization, I would like to
thank you for your leadership and courage in
introducing H.R. 3106, the Domestic Ter-
rorism Documentation and Analysis of
Threats in America (the ‘‘Domestic Ter-
rorism DATA’’) Act. Upon enactment, your
bill would foster crucial transparency and fa-
cilitate informed policymaking on domestic
terrorism.
Today, federal efforts to address domestic
terrorism are largely outside of public view.
Furthermore, genuine threats to the Amer-
ican people are misunderstood, or driven by
limited information. Yet according to the
Washington Post, right-wing domestic ter-
rorism is on the rise, and currently presents
a more dangerous threat to our nation and
her people than terrorism that has inter-
national origins. There is a need for central-
ized, reliable, publically accessible informa-
tion on domestic terrorism to inform effec-
tive counter-terrorism policymaking. By re-
quiring an annual, unclassified joint report
produced by the FBI and US Department of
Homeland Security and the US Department
of Justice that provides, among other things,
an assessment of domestic threats, H.R. 3106
will help to advance Congressional and pub-
lic understanding of trends in domestic ter-
rorism.
It is through this informed understanding
of the extent to which these genuine threats
to our well-being as a nation that we will be
able to effectively address this challenge.
H.R. 3106 will not only help us measure this
threat, but also manage the programmatic
solutions.
Thank you again for your visionary leader-
ship in introducing H.R. 3106, the ‘‘Domestic
Terrorism DATA’’ Act. The NAACP is
pleased to endorse this crucial legislation
and we will work with you and other, like-
minded Members of Congress to pass it into
law. Should you have any questions or com-
ments, please do not hesitate to contact me
at my office.

Hon. BENNIE THOMPSON,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: We write in
support of the Domestic and International
Terrorism Documentation and Analysis of
Threats in America Act (H.R. 3106). Your bill
would provide Congress and the general pub-
lic with more information about federal
counterterrorism activities related to acts
that meet the definitions of domestic ter-
rorism and interntional terrorism codified in
federal criminal law. In addition to pro-
moting increased transparency, account-
ability, and oversight of the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), Department of
Justice (DOJ), and Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation (FBI), the Domestic and Inter-
national Terrorism DATA Act would also
promote a better understanding of the na-
ture and extent of acts that meet the defini-
tions of domestic terrorism and inter-
national terrorism.
Members of Congress and the general pub-
lic lack sufficient understanding of how the
federal government utilizes existing authori-
ties and resources to investigate and pros-
ecute acts that meet either definition of ter-
rorism. As demonstrated in recent congres-
sional hearings, there is a general desire
among lawmakers for more information
about the federal government’s approach to
counterterrorism, particularly when it
comes to white supremacist violence. Many
communities, including Arab Americans, are
concerned about the increased threat of
white supremacist violence. However, many
of these same communities are also con-
cerned about the impact of federal counter-
terrorism policies on civil rights and civil
liberties. The Domestic and International
Terrorism DATA Act is responsive to both
concerns, as the data collection and report-
ing required of the federal government would
produce statistics on different threats facing
communities, including that of white su-
premacist violence, while also creating op-
portunities for transparency, accountability,
and oversight of federal counterterrorism ac-
tivities.
This legislation comes at a time when
many are questioning the adequacy of the
federal government’s response to the threat
of white supremacist violence, and whether
additional authorities or resources are need-
ed. Research from AAI and other organiza-
tion indicates that while the federal govern-
ment’s response to white supremacist vio-
lence is inadequate, the problem is one of
priorities and not a lack of tools. The federal
government already has the requisite au-
thorities and resources to effectively respond
to threats of white supremacist violence.
Critically, the Domestic and International
Terrorism DATA Act does not provide addi-
tional tools, but simply requires the federal

government to demonstrate how it is using
its existing authorities and resources to ef-
fectively report and respond to white su-
premacist violence.
In addition to providing critical informa-
tion about the federal government’s ap-
proach to acts that fall within the definition
of domestic terrorism, the Domestic and
International Terrorism DATA Act will pro-
vide information about federal efforts under
the ‘‘international terrorism’’ label as well.
Congress and the general public will benefit
from increased oversight of the federal ap-
proach to counterterrorism activities, re-
gardless of whether those activities are initi-
ated under the heading of ‘‘domestic ter-
rorism’’ or ‘‘international terrorism.’’
Your staff may follow up with our Policy
Counsel.

THE JEWISH FEDERATIONS
OF NORTH AMERICA,
June 6, 2019.
Hon. BENNIE THOMPSON,
Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity, House of Representatives, Washington,
DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: On behalf of
The Jewish Federations, I want to convey
our support for the ‘‘Domestic Terrorism
DATA Act.’’
Over the past three months, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department
of Homeland Security (DHS), and National
Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) have issued
no less than 6 Joint Intelligence Bulletins
(JIBs) on threats to synagogues, churches,
and mosques, cultural community centers,
and other establishments or individuals asso-
ciated with various faiths.
According to these JIBs, the FBI has inves-
tigated more than 100 threats to religious in-
stitutions over the past year, and the FBI,
DHS, and NCTC assess ‘‘domestic actors will
continue to pose a lethal threat to faith-
based communities in the Homeland and re-
main concerned about the difficulty of de-
tecting US-based threat actors and HVEs, es-
pecially lone offenders, and the individual-
ized nature of radicalization to violence.’’
The JIBs highlight a number of incidents, in-
cluding:
The Chabad of Poway attack in San Diego,
CA, April 2019;
The Tree of Life synagogue massacre in
Pittsburgh, PA, October 2018—the most dead-
ly attack on the US Jewish community ever
recorded;
The killing of two African- American pa-
trons at a Kruger’s grocery store after fail-
ing to gain entrance to the predominantly
African-American First Baptist Church of
Jeffersontown, KY, October 2018;
The surveillance of the physical security
measures by alleged agents of the Govern-
ment of Iran at the Chabad House (syna-
gogue), August 2018; and
The Bombing attack at the Dar AI-Farooq
Islamic Center in Bloomington, MN August
2017, among others.
Together, the FBI, DHS, and NCTC warn
that the county must remain vigilant in
light of the enduring threat to faith-based
communities posed by domestic extremists,
homegrown violent extremists, and inter-
national terrorist organizations. Unfortu-
nately, the threat to Jewish communal secu-
rity emanates from across the entire ideo-
logical spectrum.
For these reasons, The Jewish Federations
of North America endorses the ‘‘Domestic
Terrorism DATA Act,’’ as an important
measure to assist policy makers, federal,
state, and local counterterrorism and law en-
forcement officials, and private sector secu-
rity partners to better and more effectively
deter, prevent, preempt, and respond to hate
crime incidents and domestic and inter-
national terrorist threats in the United
States. JFNA looks forward to working with
you and your staff to build bipartisan sup-
port for the bill.
Sincerely,
ROBERT B. GOLDBERG,
Senior Director, Legislative Affairs.
THE JEWISH FEDERATIONS
OF NORTH AMERICA,
July 12, 2019.
Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Hon. MIKE ROGERS,
Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Se-
curity, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON AND RANKING
MEMBER ROGERS: The Jewish Federations of
North America endorses H.R. 3106, the ‘‘Do-
mestic Terrorism DATA Act.’’
The markup of H.R. 3106 coincides with the
United States Secret Service’s National
Threat Assessment Center’s release of its
second annual report on mass attacks in
public spaces The Secret Service studied 27
incidents where a total of 91 people were
killed and 107 more injured in public spaces
in 2018. Among the incidents: the fatal at-
tack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pitts-
burgh.
In introducing the report, Secret Service
Director James M. Murray wrote that each
new tragedy, including the attack on a syna-
gogue in Poway, CA, ‘‘serves as a reminder
that we must continue to research and pro-
vide robust training and awareness to help
prevent these tragic outcomes.’’ The report’s
findings underscore that research and infor-
mation sharing, communitywide, are essen-
tial to preventing attacks directed at houses
of worship, workplaces, schools, and other
public spaces, and concludes that threat as-
sessment, supported by leadership, collabo-
ration, and information sharing, are required
to facilitate effective prevention.
In this context, the ‘‘Domestic Terrorism
DATA Act,’’ is an important and timely
measure to assist policy makers, federal,
state, and local counterterrorism and law en-
forcement officials, and private sector part-
ners, such as The Jewish Federations, to bet-
ter and more effectively deter, prevent, pre-
empt, and respond to Domestic Terrorism.
Through the DATA Act, communitywide
stakeholders will gain a better under-
standing of the domestic terrorism threat
landscape and how best to allocate resources.
For these reasons, we urge bipartisan sup-
port for H.R. 3106, and respectfully urge the
Committee to favorably report the bill by
voice vote and without objection.
Sincerely,
ROBERT B. GOLDBERG,
Senior Director, Legislative Affairs.
LAWYERS’ COMMITTEE FOR
CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW,
June 19, 2019.
Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: On behalf of
the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil
Rights Under Law (Lawyers’ Committee), I
write to express our support for The Domes-
tic Terrorism Documentation and Analysis
of Threats in America (Domestic Terrorism
DATA) Act.
Diverse communities across the country
are targeted for hate crimes and acts of mass
violence. As the Lawyers’ Committee works
to confront hate targeting communities, we
are faced with challenges from the federal
government, including the underreporting of
hate crimes, and little publicly available
data on crimes that meet the definition of
domestic terrorism.
The Lawyers’ Committee supports efforts
to improve data collection around hate
crimes and domestic terrorism investiga-
tions. During a time when communities have
experienced an increase in white supremacist
violence, and a time when the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation created the ‘‘Black
Identity Extremist’’ designation, it is imper-
ative that our policies are data driven, and
that communities, advocates, and lawmakers
have access to data on domestic terrorism
investigations. The Domestic Terrorism
DATA Act would assist in fostering trans-
parency and would facilitate informed policy
making.
As Kristen Clarke, President and Execu-
tive Director of the National Lawyers’ Com-
mittee testified at a House Judiciary Com-
mittee Hearing on April 9th, we encourage
the use of existing laws to investigate and
prosecute acts of hate violence to the full ex-
tent of law, and to oppose efforts to create
new legislation that risk the further crim-
inalization of communities of color.
Chairman Thompson, your important ef-
forts to improve data collection around
white supremacist violence is a necessary
step to address the crisis of violence tar-
geting impacted communities. The Domestic
Terrorism DATA Act does so in a manner
that would improve data collection without
risking the further criminalization of com-
munities of color, many of whom have been
targeted by counterterrorism policies in the
past.
We applaud your leadership and look for-
ward to working with you.
Sincerely,
NADIA N. AZIZ,
Interim Co-Director and Policy Counsel,
Stop Hate Project.

tend the Southern Poverty Law Center’s full
support for the chairman’s recently intro-
duced H.R. 3106, the Domestic Terrorism
Documentation and Analysis of Threats in
America Act (also known as the Domestic
Terrorism DATA Act). We believe the bill’s
goals of fostering transparency surrounding
domestic terrorism data and increasing re-
search on the issue are of paramount impor-
tance. In testimony on June 4, 2019, before
the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil
Liberties, my colleague Lecia Brooks in-
cluded specific support for this legislative ef-
fort in her remarks.
We fully agree with your comment that,
‘‘There’s an urgent need for robust, central-
ized, and transparent Federal data to inform
counterterrorism policymaking—and Ameri-
cans deserve to know exactly how their gov-
ernment is allocating resources to under-
standing and confronting the scourge of do-
mestic terrorism. At this critical time, Con-
gress needs to lead on the issue of domestic
terrorism and direct Federal agencies to
prioritize efforts to counter these homeland
security threats.’’
We believe this proposed legislation is an
important step toward countering the grow-
ing problem of white supremacist terrorism
in the United States and abroad. We thank

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
Washington, DC, September 19, 2019.
Hon. BENNIE THOMPSON,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,

DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: This is to ad-
vise you that the Committee on the Judici-
ary has now had an opportunity to review
the provisions in H.R. 3106, the ‘‘Domestic
Terrorism DATA Act,’’ that fall within our
Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your con-
sulting with us on those provisions. The Ju-
diciary Committee has no objection to your
including them in the resolution for consid-
eration on the House floor, and to expedite
that consideration is willing to forgo action
on H.R. 2106, with the understanding that we
do not thereby waive any future jurisdic-
tional claim over those provisions or their
subject matters.
In the event a House-Senate conference on
this or similar legislation is convened, the
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to
request an appropriate number of conferees
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference.
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the
measure on the House floor. Thank you for
the cooperative spirit in which you have
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees.

COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY,

DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: Thank you for
your letter regarding H.R. 3106, the ‘‘Domes-
tic Terrorism DATA Act.’’ The Committee
on Homeland Security recognizes that the
Committee on the Judiciary has a jurisdic-
tional interest in H.R. 3106, and I appreciate
your effort to allow this bill to be considered
on the House floor.
I concur with you that forgoing action on
the bill does not in any way prejudice the
Committee on the Judiciary with respect to
its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or
similar legislation in the future, and I would
support your effort to seek appointment of
an appropriate number of conferees to any
House—Senate conference involving this leg-
islation.
I will include our letters on H.R. 3106 in the
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of this bill. I look forward to working
with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this nation.
Sincerely,
BENNIE G. THOMPSON,
Chairman.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
I rise today in support of H.R. 3106,
the Domestic and International Ter-
rorism DATA Act, introduced by the
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.
THOMPSON). I almost got up, Mr.
Speaker, when you said, ‘‘the gen-
tleman from Mississippi,’’ because I
happen to be in a small town just a few
miles away from where the chairman
lives.
H.R. 3106, as amended, passed with bi-
partisan support during the Committee
on Homeland Security markup in July.
I thank the gentleman from New York
(Mr. KING) for developing the amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute,
which passed unanimously, and broad-
ened the scope of the bill to cover all
forms of terrorism.
A central lesson from the September
11, 2001, terror attacks is that govern-
ment cannot have a siloed approach to
homeland security threats. The impor-
tance of a broad ideological focus was
stressed again during a Committee on
Homeland Security hearing on global
terror threats held on September 10,
2019.
There is bipartisan agreement on the
need for more reliable public reporting
on both domestic and international
terror threats to the homeland.
The report mandated in the legisla-
tion requires the Department of Home-
land Security, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and the Department of
Justice to produce an annual report for
6 years on a number of investigative
aspects of domestic and international
terrorism. Access to reliable data will
help policymakers and the public as-
sess trends, emerging threats, and
available resources.
The threat from international ter-
rorism also remains high. Hundreds of
U.S. citizens were radicalized by ISIS
and sought to travel to the battlefield
to carry out attacks in the homeland.
Mr. Speaker, 18 years after the hor-
rific 9/11 terror attacks, both al-Qaida
and ISIS remain intent on targeting
the United States. We were also re-
cently reminded by the direct threat
posed by Iran when a Hezbollah opera-
tive was arrested last week in New Jer-
sey for allegedly plotting attacks
against the United States.
The broad range of ideologically
based hatred and societal obsession
with violence has left scars across the
country. Obtaining a comprehensive
threat picture and reliable data is es-
sential for developing legislation and
determining what additional resources
may be necessary.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON) for
his willingness to work with us to en-
sure that the reporting requirements in
the bill track all forms of terrorism. I
strongly recommend that my col-
leagues support this bill, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. CORREA).
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 3106, the Domes-
tic and International DATA Act. I am
proud to join the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi (Mr. THOMPSON), the chairman,
my colleague and friend, in support of
this most important legislation.
This bill improves our understanding
of the Federal Government’s response
to the threat of domestic terrorism at
a time that extremist-related attacks
in the United States are on the rise.
In May 2017, the Department of
Homeland Security and the FBI re-
leased a joint intelligence bulletin that
predicted that the number of white su-
premacist movement attacks were
likely to continue to present a lethal
threat in the future.
Tragically, that prediction has prov-
en to be true. After the horrific acts of
domestic terrorism committed in Char-
lottesville and the Tree of Life shoot-
ing in Pittsburgh, I urged my congres-
sional colleagues to take action to
counter hate crimes and domestic ter-
rorism.
Chairman THOMPSON’s H.R. 3106 helps
increase transparency and research on
domestic terrorism. By requiring the
Homeland Security and Justice Depart-
ments to publish an annual public re-
port on terrorism, this bill will provide
information that will help policy-
makers develop and execute evidence-
based counterterrorism strategies.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
pass H.R. 3106.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I reiterate my support for the bill.
I ask my colleagues to support it, and
I thank, again, the chairman and the
ranking member for great collabora-
tion that made this an excellent bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, H.R. 3106, the Domestic and
International Terrorism DATA Act was
approved unanimously by the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security. This
show of unity demonstrates that there
is bipartisan support for ensuring that
the American public has data on do-
mestic terrorism and Federal efforts to
counter this threat.
Congress and the American people
need transparency from the govern-
ment. We need to know about the do-
mestic terrorism threats we face and
how the government is allocating re-
sources to confront them.
Importantly, in addition to ensuring
that such critical data is made avail-
able, H.R. 3106 requires DHS to re-
search the transnational aspect of do-
mestic terrorism. Increasingly, there is
an awareness that white supremacist
extremists rarely act in a vacuum.
From the United States to New Zea-
land to Norway, networks of extrem-
ists inspire each other to violence.
Further, the committee recently re-
ceived testimony about the similarities
and the recruitment tactics utilized by
white supremacist extremists and ISIS.
Both groups engaged in tactics that fo-
cused on victimization and distrust of
political leaders and public institu-
tions and heavily on propaganda that

The question was taken; and (two-

amend the Homeland Security Act of
2002 to direct the Commissioner of U.S.
Customs and Border Protection to es-
tablish uniform processes for medical
screening of individuals interdicted be-
tween ports of entry, and for other pur-
poses, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 577, in lieu of
the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute recommended by the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security printed
in the bill, an amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute consisting of the
text of Rules Committee Print 116–33 is
adopted, and the bill, as amended, is
considered read.
The text of the bill, as amended, is as

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members may have 5 legislative
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi?
There was no objection.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3525, the U.S. Bor-
der Patrol Medical Screening Stand-
ards Act, as amended, seeks to build on
legislation passed by the House in July
to strengthen the medical care and at-
tention provided to migrants who cross
our borders.
In July, in response to reports of in-
humane conditions at our southern
border and the death of six children
who had been in CBP custody, the
House approved a bill to require in-per-
son medical screening by licensed med-
ical professionals for apprehended indi-
viduals.
H.R. 3525 builds upon that measure
by focusing on improving health
screening processes and recordkeeping
within DHS. The bill authored by the
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. UNDER-
WOOD) takes a two-pronged approach.
First, it requires DHS to research in-
novative solutions for deficiencies in
the medical screening it conducts at
the border. This research is to be car-
ried out in consultation with national
medical professional associations that
have expertise in emergency medicine,
nursing, and pediatric care.
Importantly, in carrying out the re-
search, DHS is directed to pay par-
ticular attention to the screening of
children, pregnant women, the elderly,
and other vulnerable populations.
Once completed, DHS is required to
transmit to Congress information on
what actions the Department plans to
take in response to the research find-
ings.
b 1515
The second prong of H.R. 3525 is fo-
cused on driving DHS to improve inter-
operability among components respon-
sible for the care of apprehended indi-
viduals. It does so by requiring DHS to
set up an electronic health records sys-
tem to track health screening and care
of individuals in DHS custody. This
system would create records that could
be accessed by all the relevant DHS
components.
The benefits of such a system are un-
mistakable:
A migrant’s medical information
cannot get lost.
There will be a clear system to track
when any followup medication or med-
ical attention is needed, ensuring cases
will not fall through the cracks.
It will also avoid duplication of med-
ical services and time delays due to
lost or incomplete medical records.
As important, all the information
gained from the initial medical screen-
ing will follow the children and adults
as they are transferred to other DHS
components.
Even though apprehension numbers
have recently declined, we must take
the lessons learned from the poor han-
dling of the recent migrant crisis to
heart and drive performance improve-
ment within DHS.
H.R. 3525 represents a step in the
right direction, and, as such, I urge my
colleagues to support the legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, here we go again. Yes-
terday, the majority passed a partisan
messaging bill to provide illegal immi-
grants with an additional complaint
line at the Department of Homeland
Security. It has no chance of becoming
law. Today, they are back at it with

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8033
September 26, 2019
another partisan messaging bill that
will never become law. This time, it is
a bill to provide illegal immigrants
with electronic health records.
This bill before us today requires the
Department of Homeland Security to
set up an interoperable electronic
health records system to track the
medical history of millions of illegal
immigrants. The bill requires the sys-
tem to be up and running in 90 days.
Implementing an electronic health
records system is a complicated, labor-
intensive undertaking. They begin with
a configuration process to tailor the
commercial software to a client’s needs
and then proceed to a site-by-site in-
stallation process, followed by work-
force training.
It typically takes a year or more to
get new electronic health records up
and running at a hospital with just one
location. Making these systems inter-
operable across government agencies
only creates more complexity, extend-
ing implementation by years.
If you need a real-world example of
just how unachievable this is, look no
further than the Coast Guard. The
Coast Guard spent 7 years trying to get
an interoperable health records system
in place for its 50,000 employees. But,
after all that time, the system didn’t
work. Coast Guard servicemembers are
still forced to rely on paper medical
records.
The Coast Guard is not alone. The
Department of Defense and the Vet-
erans Administration won’t have fully
interoperable health records systems in
place for another 5 to 9 years, respec-
tively.
H.R. 3525 also requires DHS to re-
search innovative ways to conduct
medical screenings on illegal immi-
grants. DHS already conducts thou-
sands of medical screenings on mi-
grants on a daily basis. Finding new
ways to deliver health screenings more
effectively could save time and money,
but researching innovations in health-
care delivery is not the mission of
DHS.
The research mandated by this bill is
the responsibility of the Department of
Health and Human Services. DHS re-
search is properly focused on pre-
venting drugs, criminals, and terrorists
from entering our borders. We should
not force DHS to lose its focus on these
critical Homeland Security priorities.
Finally, the bill before us today fails
to provide DHS with any funding to
achieve the illegal immigrant medical
screening research and interoperable
health records mandates. We have no
idea how much this bill will cost be-
cause the majority failed to file a cost
estimate from CBO.
However, we do know from the expe-
rience of the VA, DOD, and Coast
Guard that interoperable electronic
health records systems are extremely
expensive undertakings. The DOD and
VA are on track to spend over $25 bil-
lion on their systems. The Coast
Guard’s failed system to track just
50,000 people cost $67 million.
Using the Coast Guard as a baseline,
it would cost over $2.5 billion to track
the medical history of just the illegal
immigrants that have come into our
country over the last 2 years. In other
words, without any funding provided
for the mandates in this bill, billions in
critical DHS funding used to counter
terrorist plots, equip first responders,
and respond to natural disasters would
be diverted to pay for a benefit for mil-
lions of illegal migrants.
Mr. Speaker, what is truly dis-
appointing about this bill that we have
considered over the last 2 days is that
they did nothing to prevent another
humanitarian crisis at our border. We
should be working together on legisla-
tion that reforms our broken immigra-
tion system, protects vulnerable fami-
lies and children from human smug-
glers, reduces the asylum backlog, and
expands migrant processing and long-
term housing.
When this partisan messaging bill
fails to move in the Senate, I hope
Democrats will finally choose policy
over politics and agree to work with
Republicans on solutions to our border
security problems.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. UNDER-
WOOD), sponsor of this legislation.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I in-
troduced the U.S. Border Patrol Med-
ical Screening Standards Act in re-
sponse to the conditions I witnessed
firsthand on our border this year: first
in April, then in July, and then again
in August.
The humanitarian crisis at our bor-
der is a problem that we should be
working together to solve with an evi-
dence-based approach. This legislation
is evidence-based, and I am incredibly
proud that it was able to be forwarded
by the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity with a voice vote.
I also appreciated Ranking Member
ROGERS’ willingness to engage with us
on this bill, and I am committed to
continuing to look for ways to work to-
gether on these issues going forward.
As introduced, my bill had three sec-
tions, two of which are included in the
legislation we are debating today.
First, my bill ensures implementa-
tion of an integrated electronic health
records system, or EHR, to be used by
those caring for migrants at the bor-
der. This is a direct ask from medical
officers at the Department of Home-
land Security who have identified it as
a high-priority barrier to providing
care.
We know that migrants may be
transferred between different sites and
components multiple times while in
custody, and an interoperable EHR is
essential to their health records re-
maining accessible.
Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment has an EHR. The Office of Ref-
ugee Resettlement has an EHR. But
Customs and Border Protection, which
includes the U.S. Border Patrol,
doesn’t.
When I was at the border, I saw busy,
overworked Border Patrol officials
having to keep health records on paper.
I also saw how these records don’t al-
ways follow migrants between facili-
ties and transfers of custody.
As DHS works to improve its medical
screening of children and migrants at
the border to ensure there is a min-
imum standard of care, the need for
proper recordkeeping on those
screenings will only increase.
Furthermore, children can spend
days or weeks in CBP custody before
being transferred to another compo-
nent. There must be a transferrable
record of the medical care those kids
receive and the medical conditions
that they report. That is why DHS has
already begun independently taking
steps toward an electronic health
records system, hiring staff, and solic-
iting individual component require-
ments.
This legislation formalizes and di-
rects that process, setting an aggres-
sive but achievable timeline that re-
flects the urgency of the humanitarian
situation at our southern border.
Second, this bill directs DHS to re-
search innovative approaches to ad-
dress any capability gaps in providing
medical screening, particularly for
children, pregnant women, the elderly,
and other vulnerable populations.
As a nurse, I believe in data-driven,
evidence-based policymaking. Data
shows that, in recent years, the mi-
grant population arriving at our south-
ern border has shifted from primarily
adult, economic migrants to a large
number of families and unaccompanied
children seeking asylum.
DHS must be better prepared to re-
spond to these shifts, and barriers to
providing basic medical care to mi-
grants in U.S. custody will persist as
our country continues its national con-
versation around immigration policy.
The research required by this litigation
will ensure that we have robust data on
DHS’ capabilities in order to inform
our response.
My bill also ensures that, in con-
ducting this research, DHS collabo-
rates with medical professionals who
have expertise in pediatric care so that
DHS is addressing both the physical
and the mental health needs of migrant
children at the border. By proactively
focusing on children, this research is
intended to prevent the care gaps we
have seen in other Federal facilities
caring for migrant children.
Lastly, I am proud that the third sec-
tion of this bill, as introduced, was in-
corporated into my colleague Dr. RUIZ’
legislation that was passed by the
House in July. This section set con-
sistent minimum standards for medical
screening of migrants at the border.
Proactive, consistent, and timely
medical screening is essential to a pub-
lic health response to the humani-
tarian crisis on our border, but effec-
tive medical protocols are not in prac-
tice right now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8034 September 26, 2019
By training border personnel in med-
ical screening, the legislation provides
law enforcement and staff at the border
the support that they need so that they
aren’t being forced to deal with med-
ical situations that we haven’t
equipped them for. That is why I am
pleased that this screening language
passed the House in July.
In addition to these medical screen-
ing standards, we need to ensure DHS
has an electronic health record and
close those research gaps. That is what
this legislation on the floor right now
would do: build on the legislation we
passed in July and implement the re-
maining two components of the U.S.
Border Patrol Medical Screening
Standards Act.
Anyone who has been to the border,
including many of my colleagues on
the Committee on Homeland Security,
has seen how overwhelming the hu-
manitarian situation there is. This
committee and this Congress have con-
sistently been willing to provide the
Department of Homeland Security with
the resources it needs, but with those
resources comes accountability and
oversight. This legislation is an impor-
tant and a sensible step forward to
make sure that both migrants and bor-
der officials are not placed in situa-
tions that are unsafe.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to
recognize and thank Chairman THOMP-
SON and his staff on the Committee on
Homeland Security—including
Rosaline Cohen, Alexandra Carnes,
Wendy Clerinx, Ethan McClelland, and
Brittany Lynch—for their months of
hard work on this legislation, and I
urge my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle to support it.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I am curious about the announce-
ment that the administration is in sup-
port of this and is working toward this,
because they have already issued an
announcement that they oppose this
piece of legislation. So, if it did pass, it
would be vetoed by the President.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
JOYCE), an outstanding member of the
Committee on Homeland Security.
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to
H.R. 3525.
Yet again, I fear that this partisan
legislation is a missed opportunity to
seriously address the humanitarian and
security crisis that exists today on our
southern border.
All of us here today can agree that
every human being is worthy of dignity
and respect.
As a physician, I understand the im-
portance of efficient and compas-
sionate healthcare. At the same time, I
understand firsthand how difficult it
would be to achieve the requirements
that are outlined in this bill.
Establishing an electronic health
records system in any medical system
takes at least a year, in the best case
scenario. In the bureaucratic web of
the Federal Government, this tedious
task becomes nearly impossible.
For years, Members of this House
have been working to help the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs implement its
electronic health records system, yet
the VA won’t have this completed for
another 9 years.
Quite frankly, requiring the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to imple-
ment an interoperable electronic
health records system for illegal immi-
grants in 90 days—it is simply unreal-
istic.
Adding to the problem, this costly
project would distract from other
pressing needs on the border. Our Cus-
toms and Border Protection law en-
forcement agents are hardworking
Americans who have been tasked with
an incredibly difficult job.
b 1530
While protecting our country on the
southern border, they are also pro-
viding humanitarian aid to an unprece-
dented number of immigrants. They
need our help. They do not need Con-
gress to add unnecessary and
unachievable burdens to their duties.
It is disappointing, but it is not sur-
prising that House Democrats have
chosen this approach. Time and time
again, we return to the floor to debate
partisan bills that will do nothing to
address the underlying cause of this
crisis.
Rather than continuing to grand-
stand on the House floor, I encourage
my colleagues to, once again, return to
the Committee on Homeland Security
to work on solutions that will secure
the border, end asylum loopholes, and
protect our country.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. ROY-
BAL-ALLARD), the chairwoman of the
House Appropriations Subcommittee
on Homeland Security.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker,
I rise in strong support of H.R. 3525,
and I commend my colleague, LAUREN
UNDERWOOD, for introducing this im-
portant legislation.
When migrants are in U.S. Federal
custody, it is our moral responsibility
to ensure they are treated humanely
and receive appropriate medical
screenings and care.
Earlier this year, the House Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Homeland
Security, which I chair, appropriated
significant additional resources to CBP
to improve medical care and screening.
H.R. 3525 will help ensure this care is
standardized across the Border Patrol
by requiring it to formalize the med-
ical screening process and to come up
with innovative approaches to fill med-
ical screening gaps.
The bill also requires the Border Pa-
trol to have a singular electronic
health record system, accessible to
other DHS components, to ensure con-
tinuance of care for migrants.
These are smart, simple steps that
can save the lives of migrants who left
tragic situations in their home country
to seek refuge in the United States. I
strongly urge my colleagues to vote in
favor of this bill.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman
from Indiana (Mr. BANKS), an out-
standing leader in the Republican Con-
ference.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the ranking member for yielding.
I oppose H.R. 3525 because it is poorly
conceived, erroneously drafted, and ex-
tremely risky.
This bill would require the Border
Patrol to divert resources from its core
mission of protecting our Nation’s bor-
ders and create a new medical screen-
ing system for those who illegally cross
and enter the country between ports of
entry. I believe every part of that is
wrongheaded.
However, even if you agree with the
policy, this is not the way to do it.
Handing DHS and CBP a 30-day man-
date to put an electronic health
records system in place has no basis in
reality.
VA is currently in the second year of
a 10-year, $16 billion EHR overhaul. I
spend much of my time in Congress
overseeing it on the Veterans’ Affairs
Committee.
The EHR implementation is a tall
order for the VA, which has tens of
thousands of doctors and nurses, a huge
health IT budget, and healthcare as its
core mission.
The DHS Chief Information Officer
and CBP have none of those things. All
available evidence indicates giving
them that mandate is deeply unwise.
There is no score or cost estimate
whatsoever. The score that was filed is
from the Enhanced Border Security
and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002,
which is completely unrelated.
We are being asked to vote on this
legislation blindly. Based on the expe-
rience of institutions similar in size to
CBP that have implemented EHRs, the
price tag could easily run into the bil-
lions. Five to 10 years is a realistic
timeline, not 30 days.
Altogether, I think this is a mistake,
even if well-intentioned.
We should be devoting our resources
to reducing border crossings between
ports of entry. We should prioritize
getting detainees out of Border Patrol
custody and into ICE and HHS custody,
which already have mandates and capa-
bilities to provide medical care.
I strongly oppose H.R. 3525 for these
reasons, and I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Miss RICE),

Border Security, Facilitation, and Op-
erations Subcommittee.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
six children have died in DHS custody
over the past year.

his death, CBP implemented a new
medical screening process for young
children in their care.
However, as we soon learned, this
process was not adequate, because four
more children died in CBP custody
from preventable illnesses and sub-
standard living conditions.
Even after these new screening proc-
esses were put in place, both CBP per-
sonnel and their facilities along the
southern border remained completely
ill-equipped for months. That is why
this past July, the House passed H.R.
3239, the Humanitarian Standards for
Individuals in Customs and Border Pro-
tection Custody Act.
This bill would require DHS to im-
prove screening processes and utilize
professional medical staff. And it allo-
cated other necessary resources to con-
duct effective initial medical
screenings for all people in CBP cus-
tody.
Today, I am proud to support Con-
gresswoman UNDERWOOD’s effort to
build on that legislation.
I was honored that, in her first few
months in office, Congresswoman
UNDERWOOD joined me on two separate
trips to the southern border. She draft-
ed this bill as a direct result of what
she witnessed on those trips.
H.R. 3525 directs DHS to consult with
medical experts to improve its medical
screening process and to finally estab-
lish an electronic health record system
for people in CBP custody.
DHS has always been on the cutting
edge of innovation, leveraging the lat-
est in technological advances to fulfill
its critical mission of protecting our
homeland. And I believe it is now vital
that DHS use that same approach when
caring for the individuals and families
in its custody.
The Department has a long, success-
ful history of working with the private
sector to achieve its counterterrorism,
emergency response, and cybersecurity
goals.
This bill would require DHS to con-
sult with national and medical profes-
sional associations who have the exper-
tise in emergency medicine, nursing,
pediatric care, and other relevant med-
ical skills to make sure that DHS is
providing appropriate medical care to
migrants in its custody.
It specifically instructs DHS to re-
search innovative approaches for
screening vulnerable populations, in-
cluding pregnant women, the elderly,
and people with disabilities.
CBP is long overdue for an electronic
health records system. In 2019, there is
no good reason why an agency under as
much strain as CBP is still using paper
records. An electronic health record
system would improve CBP’s internal
operations and expedite coordination
when children and adults are trans-
ferred to other agencies.
I would hope that my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle agree that
not one more child should die in the
custody of the Federal Government.
This bill should not be controversial.
It is bipartisan; it offers commonsense
solutions; and it will help save lives.
I strongly urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting H.R. 3525 today.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Tennessee
(Mr. DAVID P. ROE), the ranking mem-
ber of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee,
and a physician.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to
H.R. 3525, the U.S. Border Patrol Med-
ical Screening Standards Act.
Before coming to Congress, I was a
practicing physician for over 31 years. I
also served in the 2nd Infantry Division
in Korea in the 2nd Medical Battalion
where, at that time, we trained, we
spent a lot of time in the field training
for mass casualties and big events.
I went to the border; I spent four
days down there on two separate occa-
sions. The last time was in June of this
year, with the Medical Director of the
Department of Homeland Security, as
chief medical adviser, and five other
members of the Doctors Caucus at the
McAllen, Texas, Rio Grande Valley sec-
tor to see for myself what was going
on.
At that time, Mr. Speaker, there
were 1,000 to 1,500 or more people a day
who came across. As we stood there by
the Rio Grande River, 15 people walked
up and turned themselves in while we
weren’t there more than 15 or 20 min-
utes.
And we looked at the facilities they
had; about how they tried to screen
those folks; and then how they tried to
sort them afterwards. And, Congress, it
was a shame on us for not providing
ICE more beds so you could move those
folks off of the border more quickly.
With these folks, they have made—
many of them have made long and ter-
rible journeys to get to where they are.
There is some good news, and I want
to share this with you now. We just had
a meeting today that the ranking
member on the committee was there
with the Acting Director of Homeland
Security; and daily arrivals are now
down 64 percent. Attainee numbers are
way down, from 20,000 in custody at the
border, to an average of 3,500 to 4,500
per day. And the best news, I think, are
unaccompanied children have been re-
duced from over 2,700 to fewer than 150.
So there have been great improve-
ments, which will actually improve the
health outcomes when you have time
enough to go through and screen those
folks.
Can you imagine in a facility that is
set for 1,000 people, and you have 1,500
or 1,800 people, you have nowhere to
send them, and a flu epidemic breaks
out? It is a very difficult thing to deal
with.
So the folks at Customs and Border
Patrol I think were doing a yeoman’s
job based on the situation they were
put in.
The problem we face isn’t the lack of
adequate care or screening. It is due to
the previously lax enforcement of our
immigration laws, and our Border Pa-
trol agents just really being overrun
with people illegally crossing the bor-
der.
Really, without adding new and im-
possible-to-meet guidelines for our
Border Patrol agents, we should look
for other ways to intervene with illegal
crossings, and I have mentioned that.
These people are often, as I said, es-
caping unimaginable problems in their
home country. But once they reach our
border, the CBP is doing the absolute
best they can to help them.
Now, the bill would accomplish very
little but overburdening our already-
taxed DHS staff with their limited re-
sources. This bill would require the
DHS to purchase and implement an
electronic health record within 30 days
in order to coordinate care for illegal
border crossers.
Mr. Speaker, I think I may be one of
the only people in the U.S. Congress
that has actually implemented an elec-
tronic health record in my own prac-
tice. It took us a year to do it in our
medical practice, to put 80,000 charts
in.
Can you imagine putting over a mil-
lion? And the U.S. military, the De-
partment of Defense, right now is
spending about $5-plus-billion for a
million and a half soldiers.
The Veterans’ Affairs Committee,
which I am very aware of, and I will be
going to Seattle, Washington, Madigan
Army Medical Center on Sunday night
and Monday of next week to evaluate
their system. We are spending $16 bil-
lion to implement this.
Let me say this: The DOD and VA
spent a billion dollars trying to imple-
ment a system where the electronic
health record at DOD and VA could
talk to each other, and they failed. So
it is a very difficult, complex situation
to put an electronic health record in.
I think it is a noble goal, and it
should be looked at. But it is just
something not doable in 30 days. I ab-
solutely guarantee you it will fail.
These are labor-intensive, and many of
them fail.
I know, as I was saying a little bit
ago, that the Department of Defense
and VA are currently implementing
this program which will—the total cost
of that will be $25 billion.
And this legislation gives DHS a co-
lossal, unfunded mandate and it has no
expertise or capacity to handle this,
and would consume all of the supple-
mental that we have sent them.
Further, implementing a new health
record at a hospital takes a year or
more, not 30 days. So it is absolute
folly to think that DHS could do this,
contract it, figure it out, train the peo-
ple at all these ports of entry, and do
that in 30 days. It can’t be done.
The Coast Guard, a DHS component,
had a disastrous experience trying to
implement an EHR in about 40 clinics
between 2010 and 2015, and they spent
$67 million and gave up.
So if we can’t deliver a modern
healthcare record system to our men
and women who put their lives on the
line without spending billions of dol-
lars and the better part of a decade,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

why would we rush to develop one that
is doomed to failure for people who are
knowingly breaking our laws?
Until the VA and DOD have secured a
fully interoperable record for our serv-
icemembers, we should not divert
scarce resources and time creating one
for illegal immigrants.
I do want to say that I am willing to
work with the other side in any way, in
all ways, to improve the health care of
the people who come here. We are
Americans. That is what we do, and we
are the best in the world at it.
So if you want to sit down and work
out an issue and a problem with me, I
am more than happy to do that.
b 1545
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker,
thank you very much for the leader-
ship of the chairman, and I appreciate
the ranking member on the floor.
I have had the privilege of traveling
with Congresswoman UNDERWOOD to
the border in some very challenging
circumstances, and I appreciated, as a
nurse, as a trained nurse, as she is a
trained nurse, I appreciated the astute-
ness with which she viewed this mat-
ter.
Let me say to my good friend, the
doctor, we are always looking forward
to trying to work with our colleagues
on the basic humanity of every person,
recognizing that this is not about
healthcare for undocumented immi-
grants. It is about individuals who are
in the custody of the United States.
Just picture for a moment, having
gone to the border now for almost two
decades as a resident of Texas, just
imagine that there are moments when
there is an influx of individuals fleeing
for their lives. It happened under Presi-
dent Obama’s administration in 2014,
and we managed it. There was no
hysteria. There were facilities that
were built. There was medical care
that we were able to access.
In this instance, it did not happen.
And the glaring reality of children who
died and those who were working hard,
the law enforcement personnel, I saw
them trying to do as much as they
could, but without a structure, we lost
lives. So the importance of this legisla-
tion is particularly one that I think is
important.
Picture for a moment, when we were
in the midst of the crisis, Coast Guard
medical personnel, doctors with a
table, some medicine on the corner,
their medical paraphernalia out in the
open where files were, no place to deal
with the medical needs of anyone. That
is not American.
We are not asking to provide
healthcare. This is not Medicare or
Medicaid. It is a basic dignity of pro-
tecting the American people by ensur-
ing that these people are treated for
whatever might be necessary.
So the e-record process is powerful
because it allows the accessing of med-
ical care by having a record system and
also by having that system being
accessed by all DHS components oper-
ating on the border. It is just a simple
case of protecting those of us in the
United States, protecting those who
are in our custody.
Why not? Why not be proactive and
positive for dealing with fellow human
beings?
Let’s get away from this undocu-
mented and realize this is a land of
laws and immigrants. We all, collec-
tively, together, want to abide by that.
But we also realize that, when 9-
month-old Roger is in my hands, and
he crossed the border in the arms of his
sister, that 9-month-old Roger, even
though I saw him in one of the HHS
centers, probably needed care.
Or the woman who had given birth 45
days earlier and holding in her hands a
45-day-old baby who had not seen a
doctor, she had not been to the hos-
pital. This might help give aid to those
individuals.
So let me be very clear: This is an
important initiative. It is an initiative
that I think most Americans will sup-
port.
I rise to support the gentlewoman’s
legislation and thank her for her cour-
age and astuteness in bringing this to
our attention.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, how much time do I have re-
maining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 13 minutes remaining.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms.
BARRAGÁN).
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of H.R. 3525, the U.S.
Border Patrol Medical Screening
Standards Act.
Mr. Speaker, I have been to the
southern border a number of times. I
have seen the cold concrete holding
cell where Felipe Gomez Alonzo, an 8-
year-old boy, spent his last days. He
was apprehended on December 18, 2018,
and did not receive proper medical
testing, screenings, and care.
Six days later, on Christmas Eve,
while Americans were celebrating fam-
ily and a holiday, Felipe would go on to
suffer from a 103-degree fever. Felipe
would also start vomiting and become
weak, then die while in custody of the
U.S. Government.
I wish I could say that he was the
last child that died in U.S. custody, but
he wasn’t. In the 17 months since the
Trump administration implemented
their zero-tolerance policy at the
southern border, inhumanely jailing
migrant children and cruelly sepa-
rating children from their parents,
six—let me repeat that, six—migrant
children have tragically fallen ill and
died in Federal custody:
Darlyn Cristabel Cordova-Valle was
10 years old;
Jakelin Caal Maquin was 7;
Felipe Gomez Alonzo was 8;
Juan de Leon Gutierrez was 16;
Carlos Hernandez Vasquez was 16; and
Wilmer Josue Ramirez Vasquez was a
21⁄2-year-old baby.
The death of these children dem-
onstrates the dangers faced by mi-
grants at the hands of the very govern-
ment they hoped would save them. The
inadequate medical recordkeeping is
dangerous and is a huge gap that we
must fix.
How many more kids will have to die
before DHS makes effective changes in
the way they improve medical
screenings and track medical records?
How many?
Ms. UNDERWOOD, a nurse and the au-
thor of the bill, has been to the south-
ern border with me to see the problem
firsthand. It is her medical training
and background that led to this bill so
that we could research ways to im-
prove medical screenings and improve
the tracking of medical records, some-
thing that is not happening right now.
Mr. Speaker, this body and this Na-
tion has a moral obligation to make
sure that no more children needlessly
die in detention at our southern border
and, in doing so, to perhaps bring some
measure of meaning to the tragic
deaths of those six children.
I urge my colleagues to support H.R.
3525.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I note several Members across the
aisle have talked about the need to im-
prove our health screenings. This bill
does nothing to deal with that. It is
about requiring the installation of
electronic medical records.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WAT-
SON COLEMAN).
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr.
Speaker, I want to thank the chairman
for yielding, and I want to thank my
colleague, Ms. UNDERWOOD, for her
work on this very important issue.
For nearly a year now, we have
watched with growing horror and out-
rage as the cruel and inhumane com-
bination of xenophobia, malicious pol-
icy from the White House, and indiffer-
ence to people in need has built into a
crisis at our southern border.
We have let this come to a point
where children have died, children flee-
ing violence and persecution and hor-
rors in their home countries seeking to
come here, the land of opportunity and
promise, children we separated from
their parents and loved ones, children
that we failed entirely here on our soil
and in our custody.
We cannot allow that to continue,
and this measure that we are taking up
today will take important steps to ad-
dress gaps in medical screening at the
border so that we don’t fail any more
children. It pushes us to find new ways
to handle the unique needs of health
screening at the border, with special
emphasis on children and vulnerable
groups.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8037
September 26, 2019
Just as importantly, it mandates im-
plementation of an e-record system so
that we are not letting anyone slip
through the cracks.
An e-record system is not something
we have never heard of before. What
has happened at the border thus far, in-
cluding the tragic deaths of the chil-
dren, those mentioned by my colleague
like Jakelin Caal Maquin and Felipe
Gomez Alonzo, is proof that we are not
doing enough, and that is not because
we can’t.
I am grateful to Ms. UNDERWOOD for
stepping up to ensure we do more, and
I urge all of my colleagues to support
this important bill and its passage.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, here we have another bill that dem-
onstrates just how disingenuous Demo-
crats are about securing our borders
and fixing our broken immigration sys-
tem. But in a new twist, today’s bill
shockingly prioritizes illegal immi-
grants over servicemembers and vet-
erans. They are going to send another
partisan messaging bill to the Senate,
where it will promptly die.
When Democrats are ready to legis-
late real solutions to the problem that
this country faces, Republicans stand
ready to work with them. In the mean-
time, I urge all Members to oppose this
bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Mr. Speaker, in the last year, six
children have died after being in CBP
custody. This disheartening statistic
demands our attention, especially
when you stop to think that, in the en-
tire decade preceding these deaths, not
one child died in CBP custody.
Processes for the treatment of mi-
grants crossing the border clearly need
to be improved. H.R. 3525 does that by
forcing DHS to look at its medical
screening process and come up with
ways to improve it and address any
performance gaps. It also helps move
the Department’s recordkeeping into
the 21st century.
H.R. 3525 is one step we can take to
ensure that the money that DHS is al-
ready spending on screening and caring
for apprehended families and children
is done wisely.
And I might add, Mr. Speaker, all of
us saw the conditions that children
were kept in along the border. You
can’t put children in fences. You can’t
give people inadequate healthcare. You
can’t do those things.
Most of us in this body are either
parents or grandparents or we have rel-
atives who are. For us not to care
about children is something that
America should never be proud of. We
are a nation of values. Our values have
to say that children matter.
Ms. UNDERWOOD’s bill clearly says
that children in the custody of the
United States Government matter. Not
only do they matter, but we have to
keep up with them; we should not lose
them. If they are sick, we need to have
copies of their records accessible so
that our professionals who are tasked
with the responsibility of taking care
of them actually know what is going
on.
So I am clear about the bill. If my
colleagues on the other side are not in-
terested in helping children and solving
this problem that we have along our
borders, then that is too bad. Demo-
crats are prepared to work with them if
they want to. If not, children do mat-
ter.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 3525, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8039
September 26, 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Tennessee is recognized for 5 minutes
in support of his motion.
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, many of us made the trip this sum-
mer to Normandy to celebrate the 75th
anniversary of the D-Day landings. It
was an amazing opportunity.
Standing among the rows of crosses
and Stars of David in the U.S. ceme-
tery, I was reminded of the sacrifices of
our incredible American warriors.
Standing there ignited my memory
of 24 years of wearing the uniform. I
was reminded of my driver when I was
a young second lieutenant. He was 4
foot 11 and had a heart the size of his
home State of New York. I recalled my
radio telephone operators, both from
California. When I was a commander in
the 82nd Airborne Division, they stuck
to me like glue and would try so often
to sneak food in so that we could eat
while we were all rigged up in our air-
borne gear before an airborne oper-
ation.
Of course, my friends from the war
flashed into my mind. I will never for-
get watching the flag-draped coffin of a
fellow Army Ranger carried into the
back of a C–17 in Bagram, Afghanistan
for his last trip home.
Our veterans deserve everything that
we can give them. However, in the past
few years, despite improvements in the
VA electronic health records system,
problems and delays still remain. For
example, the very benefits that Con-
gresswoman UNDERWOOD in this bill ad-
vances for illegal aliens flooding across
our southern border, our veterans don’t
have those benefits. Let me say that
again: This bill, without the amend-
ment I am asking this body to con-
sider, advances healthcare services to
illegal aliens before it does to our
American heroes.
The VA Secretary testified before
Congress that it will take his depart-
ment 10 years to fully deploy this new
system.
Mr. Speaker, I have the deployment
schedule for the VA from their website,
and I will include this in the RECORD at
a later date.
Mr. Speaker, this timeline states
that our veterans will not get an inter-
operable electronic health record at all
VA healthcare facilities until Sep-
tember 20 of 2027.
VA medical facilities serving vet-
erans in Virginia won’t get it until
2024. Pennsylvania, New York, New
Jersey, and New England won’t be fully
operational until 2026. It won’t be until
2027 that VA medical facilities in Iowa,
Minnesota, and Illinois are fully oper-
ational. Veterans in my home State of
Tennessee won’t benefit from inter-
operable electronic health records
until 2023.
Yet, without this amendment, with-
out my amendment, we are going to
give it to illegal aliens within 90 days.
Mr. Speaker, these are the same men
and women who, when they raised their
right hand and took that oath, wrote a
blank check for America, for every per-
son in this room, that was cashable, re-
deemable, all the way up until their
life, their very life.
I think our constituents across this
great country would find it appalling
that we are about to give this health
record system to illegal immigrants
before our veterans receive it.
All this amendment does is ensure
that our veterans get this service first.
If you vote against this motion to re-
commit, you are giving an electronic
health medical record to illegal aliens
before our veterans.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
rise in opposition to the motion to re-
commit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Illinois is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, my
colleagues in this body, medical ex-
perts, and our neighbors and constitu-
ents all agree the humanitarian and
medical situation at our southern bor-
der has reached crisis levels.
During my conversations with health
officials at the border, including with
the Department of Homeland Security,
they told me that one of the most ur-
gent solutions they need is an elec-
tronic health record that can be used
by everyone providing medical care at
the border.
DHS recognizes this, too, and has al-
ready taken steps toward implementa-
tion, but it is not moving fast enough.
So this legislation directs that process,
setting an aggressive but achievable
timeline that reflects the urgency of
the humanitarian situation. The chil-
dren and families in our care can’t af-
ford any further delays.
Now, let me be clear: As a nurse, and
a member of the House Committee on
Veterans’ Affairs, providing world-class
care to our veterans is a top priority. I
have introduced a number of proposals
to improve healthcare delivery to our
veterans, and I am working on a slate
of others.
I welcome the input of my colleagues
from across the aisle who want to work
with me on modernizing the VA to bet-
ter serve women veterans, improving
mental healthcare access and quality,
ending the veteran suicide epidemic, or
any other way to serve our country’s
heroic veterans.
But where I am from, in northern Il-
linois, we can walk and chew gum at
the same time because we also have a
moral duty to ensure that children in
our government’s custody receive the
basic medical screenings and services
needed to ensure lives are not lost on
our watch.
It is simple, and we can do both. That
is what we are debating here today.
Children are dying of preventable
causes in our care for the first time in
a decade. We all agree that the human-
itarian situation at our southern bor-
der presents a complex set of chal-
lenges. Congress has a duty to address
those challenges by providing, as ap-
propriate, both resources and over-
sight.
Oversight is ongoing through the ex-
cellent work of our committees, in ad-
dition to inspectors general. We have
repeatedly met requests for additional
humanitarian funding as needed, most
recently with the approval of almost $5
billion in supplemental funding this
summer.
But this Congress is choosing, right-
ly, to provide that funding along with
additional guardrails and directions for
how to spend it in a way that is con-
sistent with American values because
the status quo is unacceptable. Chil-
dren are dying of preventable causes in
our care for the first time in a decade.
My bill, along with Congressman
RUIZ’s and Congresswoman ESCOBAR’s,
provides the guardrails and direction
to reverse course.
Let’s be clear: This is not some gold-
plated package. What these policies do
is establish minimum, consistent
standards that ensure that we can ef-
fectively provide the most basic med-
ical screenings and care. What we are
doing is making sure that children and
families in our care are asked ques-
tions like, ‘‘Do you have a fever? Do
you have your inhaler? Could you be
pregnant?’’ and that their answers are
recorded and used to make sure that
they are provided basic care.
These changes are urgently needed.
Children are dying of preventable
causes in our care for the first time in
a decade, children like Darlyn, Jakelin,
Felipe, Juan, Wilmer, and Carlos.
Medical care for these children has
huge, unacceptable gaps. We have a re-
sponsibility to implement common-
sense, effective policies that we know
will fix that because children should
never die from a preventable cause in
our care.
We have a responsibility to ensure
that the Department of Homeland Se-
curity is better prepared for future
challenges to ensure the failures that
contributed to these deaths are never
repeated.
Children in our care have been sepa-
rated from their families. They have
been denied toothbrushes and blankets.
They have been saddled with trauma
that can affect them for their entire
lives.
We must make sure that these chil-
dren and their families have access to
basic medical care and screening while
in custody. That is why we have to re-
ject this procedural gimmick, which
could delay essential tools and re-
sources from getting to officials at the
border who need them.
I urge all my colleagues, vote ‘‘no’’
on the motion to recommit and vote
‘‘yes’’ to pass this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, read the
bill, read the amendment that they of-
fered.
Eric Cantor called MTRs a gimmick.
This is the gimmick of gimmicks. It

not a single thing. You know it. I know

All it does is try to delay this bill for
10 years, and they are going to all vote
against the bill.

ELECTING MEMBERS TO CERTAIN

bers be, and are hereby, elected to the fol-
lowing standing committees of the House of

Mr. Timmons.
(3) COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY.—
Mr. Bishop of North Carolina.
(4) COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND

lina.
(5) COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS.—Mr.

The resolution was agreed to.
A motion to reconsider was laid on

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 1406
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, I ask unanimous consent to remove
Representative BILL FOSTER as a co-
sponsor of H.R. 1406.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida?
There was no objection.
f
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 2723
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to be removed as a
cosponsor of H.R. 2723.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from North Carolina?
There was no objection.
f
REQUEST TO CONSIDER S. 820,
DEBBIE SMITH REAUTHORIZA-
TION ACT
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of S. 820 to
bring justice to victims of sexual as-
sault, the Debbie Smith Reauthoriza-
tion Act, and ask for its immediate
consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
BRINDISI). Under guidelines consist-
ently issued by successive Speakers, as
recorded in section 956 of the House
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I have a
parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman will state her parliamentary
inquiry.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, this has
not been consistently. This is the first
time this has been UCed.
I understand the guidelines just
cited, Mr. Speaker; however, seeing no
objection from leadership or com-
mittee members on either side of the
aisle, does that constitute clearance
and allow the Chair to entertain my
motion under the rules of the House?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. A unani-
mous consent request for the consider-
ation of that measure would have to re-
ceive clearance by the majority and
minority floor and committee leader-
ships. The Chair is unaware of such
clearance. Therefore, the Chair cannot
entertain that request at this time.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I have a
further parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman will state her parliamentary
inquiry.
Mrs. WAGNER. Again, seeing no ob-
jection on either side of the aisle, and
since this is dealing with grants for
DNA testing and rape kits, can the
Chair advise what is required pursuant
to section 956 of the House rules to
allow my motion to be considered to
protect victims of sexual assault.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the
Chair previously advised, that request
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I urge
that the Speaker and the majority
leader schedule the bill on the floor im-
mediately to protect victims of sexual
assault.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has not been recognized for
debate.

TRUMP BEHAVIOR THREATENING
SANCTITY OF ELECTIONS
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I am dis-
gusted and appalled with the latest
news about President Trump’s behav-
ior. He has repeatedly threatened the
sanctity of our elections with his be-
havior. His latest call to the President
of Ukraine is just par for the course
with this administration.
This is not the country I grew up in
where the rules and law have to apply
to everyone. No one man is above the
law.
This is not the way our elected offi-
cials should behave. The institutions of
our country are meant for the people of
this country, not for personal gain.

END PARTISAN POLITICS
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, just 2
weeks ago, I spoke on the floor and
said we needed to end partisan politics
and deliver results for the American
people, but just this week, Speaker
PELOSI and my Democrat colleagues
announced their plan to move forward
with an impeachment inquiry into
President Trump.
Their agenda to constantly under-
mine President Trump comes at a seri-
ous cost to the American people: ignor-
ing the pressing issues at hand.
One of the best examples is Congress’
lack of action to tackle the undeniable
crisis at our southern border. Both
Democrats and Republicans agree this
crisis must be addressed, which should
make this a bipartisan issue.
But, once again, Democrats continue
to put forward partisan bills. This
week, they brought to the floor the il-
legal immigrant customer service act,
and we just voted on the improving
healthcare for every illegal immigrant
act.
These bills will do nothing to solve
the problems at our southern border
and would only obstruct border en-
forcement and impede law enforce-
ment’s ability to protect this country.
Why are Democrats prioritizing ille-
gal immigrants over American citi-
zens?
Let’s end this partisan political game
and get to work for the American peo-
ple.

HONORING BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
ON HIS 70TH BIRTHDAY
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor Bruce Springsteen, the
New Jersey legend who turned 70 years
old this week.
There is so much that this Jersey
girl could say to honor Bruce
Springsteen on his birthday. I could re-
mind you of his 19-plus albums, 15
world tours, sold-out Broadway shows,
best-selling autobiography, countless
GRAMMYs, an Oscar, Kennedy Center
Honors, Presidential Medal of Free-
dom, and membership in the New Jer-
sey Hall of Fame.
I could recount his lyrics that are po-
etic stories of everyday people just try-
ing to get by. I could tell you of his
epic concerts and the way he connects
with each audience member in sold-out
stadiums, and how he makes them feel
as though he is singing directly to
them.
If you are lucky enough to experience
it, as I have, a live Springsteen show is
not something you watch, but nearly 4
hours of power, raw beauty, and sweat
that you actively participate in.
Or maybe, to best honor him for his
70th birthday, I should proudly say
that Bruce Springsteen is the unoffi-
cial spokesperson and ambassador of
our great State.
He sings for the underdog, for the
quiet hero, and for every New Jerseyan
who has dared to dream of a better life
for themselves.

CONGRATULATING DR. LUCY
GREENE, RECIPIENT OF THE W.
PARKER GREENE LEGACY
AWARD
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Dr. Lucy
Greene, who was awarded the W.
Parker Greene Legacy Award on Sep-
tember 16, 2019.
Dr. Greene, along with her late hus-
band, Parker Greene, were staunch ad-
vocates for Moody Air Force Base for
the last 40 years. During this time, the
pair and their advocacy could not have
been more important to the First Con-
gressional District of Georgia.
They have been referred to as our re-
gion’s civilian secret weapons in keep-
ing Moody Air Force Base open and
viable. Making relationships with gen-
erals at the Department of Defense,
they kept Moody Air Force Base off the
list for base closures. In turn, they
kept the Valdosta community churn-
ing.
But on her own, Dr. Lucy Greene was
critical in supporting the airmen at the
base. She taught courses for airmen
who had children with developmental
disorders. She even handed out fabric
softener sheets so the airmen could
keep the sand gnats away.
Congratulations on your award, Dr.
Greene. You deserve it.
f
WILLIAM J. HUGHES TECHNICAL
CENTER
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, the
William Hughes Technical Center in
south Jersey is the FAA’s national sci-
entific test base for R&D, and the eval-
uation of transportation systems. It is
the Nation’s premier air transportation
system laboratory.
I was disappointed to see that the
FAA, earlier this year, proposed fund-
ing cuts for critical research programs
at the tech center that ultimately im-
prove the safety of all Americans. That
is why I am grateful to Chairman
PRICE of the Transportation Sub-
committee for working with me to re-
store funding for the tech center.
I have also heard troubling rumors
about a potential realignment at the
tech center. For those who seek to
eliminate, shift jobs, or reporting du-
ties away from the tech center, I say
this: You will have a fight on your
hands, like a fight you have never seen
before.
I am proud to have this incredible fa-
cility in south Jersey, and I thank all
of the hardworking men and women of
the tech center for continuing to keep
our skies safe.
f
FLEXIBILITY THROUGH LOWER
EXPENSES HEALTH CARE ACT
(Mr. HARRIS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, as a Mem-
ber of Congress, a physician, a father,
and a grandfather, it has become clear
to me that certain provisions under the
Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare,
have proven to be completely
unaffordable and unsustainable. These
stifling regulations have simulta-
neously forced an increase in insurance
premiums and a decrease in patient
choice.
That is why Representative BUDD and
I introduced H.R. 4484 yesterday, the
Flexibility Through Lower Expenses
Healthcare, or FLEX Act. This bill will
codify into law the Trump administra-
tion’s rules on short-term limited dura-
tion insurance and association health
plans.
It will allow small businesses and
self-employed workers the opportunity
to secure more affordable health insur-
ance by banding together to act as one
large employer, and it will open the
door for individuals to purchase tem-
porary affordable health insurance for
up to 1 year.
The FLEX Act will provide the nec-
essary flexibility and affordability that
Americans have been seeking in their
healthcare, free of the strain and ex-
pense that have, unfortunately, become
the new normal under ObamaCare.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MIKE

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
life of Sergeant Mike McInturff who
passed away September 10. I was hon-
ored to have known Mike, and I want
to extend my deepest condolences to
his family, especially his wife of 34
years, Debbie Nelson McInturff.
From the time he was a child, Mike
dreamed of being a fireman. It takes a
selfless determination to take on the
challenges first responders face every
day, and Mike served faithfully as a
volunteer and a professional firefighter
for 39 years. I am grateful for Mike’s
work in this role, where he touched
countless lives in Northeast Tennessee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8043
September 26, 2019
I am especially thankful for him
being one of the heroic boots-on-the-
ground firefighters in my hometown of
Johnson City, Tennessee, when it expe-
rienced its worst-ever disaster on
Christmas Eve 1989. For 5 hours, fire
crews worked tirelessly as the fire
spread throughout the city’s tallest
building, the John Sevier apartment
building.
Our community mourned the 16 lives
claimed by that tragedy. And my
church, Munsey Memorial United
Methodist Church, served as a morgue
that Christmas Eve night.
It is my honor to recognize the life of
Sergeant Mike McInturff and commend
him for his 39 faithful years of service.
My prayers are with his family and
friends during this difficult time.
f
FARM STRESS AND OPIOIDS IN
MISSISSIPPI
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, September
is National Recovery Month, a time to
look for ways to support recovery
strategies for mental health and sub-
stance use disorders.
Mississippi State University’s Exten-
sion Service is working to reduce
opioid misuse by farmers and ranchers
across our State.
Farmers have to face changing mar-
kets, weather events, financial hard-
ships, leading to farm stress while op-
erating in one of the most hazardous
occupations. A valid opioid prescrip-
tion given to a farmer can lead to
opioid misuse. Three out of four farm-
ers have reported that they have been
affected by opioid misuse, and that
opioids can be easily accessed.
Through support from the USDA and
SAMHSA, Mississippi State University
is training extension service agents to
deliver mental health first aid to farm-
ers, as well as working with phar-
macists and medical personnel to bet-
ter recognize misuse. This program is
already demonstrating incredible re-
sults as farmers are utilizing extension
agents to seek care.
I applaud the work of Mississippi
State University and other organiza-
tions in Mississippi that recognize
needs in our community and are find-
ing creative ways to reach Mississip-
pians with care.
f
WORLD HEART DAY
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to bring attention to one of the
most important issues facing our Na-
tion and world.
This weekend is World Heart Day, a
time for individuals around the globe
to annually be informed about the
issues surrounding cardiovascular dis-
ease, which includes heart disease and
stroke, and to highlight the actions
that individuals can take to prevent
and control the disease.
You see, cardiovascular disease is the
world’s leading cause of death. Each
year it claims the lives of almost 18
million people, while devastating many
more families.
You see, I have cardiovascular dis-
ease; and as someone with a heart con-
dition, I humbly stand before the
House and I say that we can do better.
World Heart Day is about families,
communities, and governments around
the globe coming together, regardless
of affiliation, to combat a shared
enemy that affects the lives of far too
many.
With controlling our diets, sticking
to an exercise regimen, and avoiding
the use of tobacco products, 80 percent
of premature deaths from cardio-
vascular disease can be avoided.
Please join me in taking control of
your health before it is too late.

RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF
JOHNNY MAGIC
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. SOTO) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority
leader.
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I would like
to recognize the award-winning host of
XL 106.7’s morning show, Johnny
Magic, with his show, Johnny’s House,
for the great work he has done for the
Central Florida community.
Johnny was born in Charlotte, North
Carolina, but has called Orlando home
for the last 30 years, while working for
XL 106.7. He uses his voice, talents, and
resources to work with our commu-
nity. During times of need, after nat-
ural disasters, and times of crisis in
our community, he has gone out of his
way to help those in need. He genu-
inely cares for this community, and it
shows through all of his hard work.
Johnny Magic has witnessed first-
hand the struggles that many families
in our community experience. These
experiences inspired him to develop a
program that would make it possible
for disadvantaged families to provide a
wonderful holiday experience for their
children. This is how the Baby DJ, Inc.
program came to fruition.
Over the last 25 years, this program
has worked and collaborated with local
churches, nonprofit organizations, and
community partners to fulfill this mis-
sion. With the help of volunteers, the
Baby DJ program has been able to pro-
vide resources to assist families in
need and, in recent years, has expanded
their operation to serve other chari-
table efforts that take place through-
out the year.
The program has provided backpacks
and school supplies to countless
schools in need in central Florida.
These supplies provide a welcome relief
to the families and students, as well as
to teachers who routinely pay for
school supplies for students and for
their classrooms.
Johnny Magic, and his team, and the
Baby DJ program, are not only inspir-
ing, but it is also what makes central
Florida so wonderful.
So I want to thank Johnny Magic, I
want to thank the good folks at John-
ny’s House, the Baby DJ, Inc. program
for their contributions and for his con-
tribution to central Florida.

ing the State legislative session. Since
then, Kelly knew that being part of
politics and the political process was
her calling.
Soon after graduating, in 2013, Kelly
worked for the Orange County govern-
ment, overseeing bilingual communica-
tions. She then transitioned to central
Florida political director for Hillary
Rodham Clinton’s Presidential cam-
paign. Kelly’s involvement with the
campaign introduced her to commu-
nity leaders who inspired her to use her
skills, knowledge, and relationships to
advocate for communities in need.
In 2017, Kelly was the State legisla-
tive advocate for the League of Women
Voters of Florida, where she worked
with allies and elected officials to ad-
vocate on issues like gun control, voter
rights, and funding for public edu-
cation. Kelly successfully raised aware-
ness on these issues with the help of
statewide members.
Soon after, Kelly began a new chal-
lenge as the director of advocacy and
government relations for Second Har-
vest Food Bank of central Florida, the
largest hunger-relief organization in
the region. In this role, she has in-
creased community engagement on ad-
vocacy efforts, including the farm bill,
the intersection of health, hunger, and
education of food insecurity and other
issues at all levels of government. This
has resulted in receiving Feeding
America’s Advocacy Hall of Fame
Award every year.
Kelly is also a 2018 recipient of the
Orlando Business Journal’s 40 Under 40
award. Kelly resides in Orlando, Flor-
ida, with her husband, Eddie
Johnstone, and their two cats.
For that, we honor Ms. Kelly
Quintero.

f
UNITED STATES-ISRAEL
EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of
the minority leader.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, I thank everyone for joining
me tonight on this Special Order.
In August, my colleagues and I trav-
eled to Israel with the United States-
Israel Education Association, and to-
night we wanted to share with you
about our trip. I am joined by BRADLEY
BYRNE from Alabama, ANN WAGNER
from Missouri, and Dr. PHIL ROE from
Tennessee.
Through the years, the USIEA has
led Members of Congress behind the
Green Line, so into the West Bank, in
Judea and Samaria.
Tonight we wanted to share with you
some of what we saw, what we learned,
witnessing the economic cooperation
and integrated businesses between Pal-
estinian and Israeli business leaders. It
is really an untold story. It is an un-
told story, one that includes the story
of hope and opportunity.
For me, it was my first trip to Israel
since being named the United States
Representative to the U.N., and it re-
newed my strong commitment to en-
sure that America remains a bipar-
tisan, steadfast, and staunch supporter
of Israel.
Tonight we are going to get started
with my friend and colleague from Ala-
bama, BRADLEY BYRNE, to share about
the trip.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE).
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from Washington
(Mrs. RODGERS) both for giving me this
time, but also for her leadership on
this and other issues.
Mr. Speaker, beside me is a photo-
graph of myself; Avi Zimmerman, who
is the head of the Judea and Samaria
Chamber of Commerce, an Israeli Jew;
Sheik Ashraf Jabari, a Palestinian
businessman; the gentlewoman from
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS); the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER); and the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. DAVID P. ROE).
Mrs. WAGNER and Dr. ROE joined Mrs.
MCMORRIS RODGERS and me on this in-
credible trip. We are standing in the
Sheik’s home in Hebron. The Sheik is a
former security adviser to the Pales-
tinian Authority, an incredible busi-
nessman.
Now, before I get back to that meet-
ing, I want to make sure that we begin
to make clear to everybody in America
that much of what we have learned or
believed we have learned about what is
going on in Israel between Israelis and
Palestinians is not true.
What we learned, both from Sheik
Jabari and from others, is that some-
thing new and exciting is happening be-
tween the Israelis and the Palestinians
in Israel.
There is this idea out there that the
Israelis and the Palestinians have been
fighting one another for years. That is
not true.
The truth of the matter is, after the
Romans expelled most of the Jews from
Israel in the first and second century
AD, there remained a small number of
Jews in what was known as Israel and
then later on as the Province of Pal-
estine. Then over the years, some
would creep back in, but there was a
relatively small number of Jews in
that land, and they lived in peace with
their Arab neighbors.
It wasn’t until the 20th century,
when large numbers of Jews began to
move into that area from Europe and
the U.S. and other places, that we
began to see some clashes between the
Arabs that lived in that area and the
Jews that were moving there.
In 1948, when Israel proclaimed itself
to be a State, there was an unfortunate
war between them, their Arab neigh-
bors, and many of the Arab countries
that surrounded them.
As a result of that, a State was
formed with true territories, but there
was a problem between Israel and Jor-
dan, which was one of the countries
that they fought, and in order to decide
who lived where, they took a green pen
and wrote on a map a line, and it was
called the Green Line. Jordan existed,
or had control, on the east side of that
Green Line, Israel on the west.
A second unfortunate war occurred in
1967, the Six-Day War, which many of
us remember. As a result of that war,
Israel was able to take control of all of
the area that is now within Israel on
the east side of the Green Line.
Those two wars and what came out of
them is where a lot of the problems be-
tween the Palestinians and the Israelis
started. It is not ancient, it is not built
into their genes. It is not something
that can’t be overcome.
So let me go back to this picture. Avi
Zimmerman, as I said, is an Israeli
Jew, and Sheik Jabari is a Palestinian
Muslim standing next to one another
in his home in Hebron.
We actually heard from them and
other Israelis and other Palestinians
about their desires and their efforts to
work together in business and industry
and economics. It is bringing people to-
gether.
The day before we visited the Sheik,
we were in a town in the northern part
of Israel—in what Israel calls Sama-
ria—called Ariel. In Ariel, there are
two parts, two industrial parts, that
have 209 different manufacturing com-
panies in them. Most of the people
working in those manufacturing fac-
tories are Palestinians, and they make
on average four times as much as they
could make if they were working some-
where else in what we, unfortunately,
call the West Bank, but is really not
the West Bank.
It is good for those Palestinians to
make that much money. It is good for
them to be able to take advantage of
the miracle of the Israeli economy.
Giving them that opportunity so that
they can have a better life for them-
selves and their families is hope.
Sheik Jabari and what he is trying to
do is hope.
What the people in Israel need more
than anything else is hope.
Perhaps our struggles over the last 20
years to create a two-state solution
there has blinded us from the fact that
this is really about people. It is not
about lines drawn on a piece of paper
that we can’t seem to get a resolution
to.
b 1815
Those people, if they are allowed to
live and work together as they want to,
maybe they will find peace on their
own without some push from the rest
of us, which seems to be getting us no-
where.

At any rate, I hope that we, in this
country, and we, in this Congress, can
do everything in our power to help
these good people grow economically in
their businesses, but also find that
peace that only people-to-people ac-
tions can find for us all.
I thank the gentlewoman, and I am
looking forward to hearing the rest of
this Special Order.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman
from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER).
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my very dear friend and colleague,
CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS from the
great State of Washington, for leading
our delegation, for putting this Special
Order together this evening, and for in-
cluding all of us—Dr. PHIL ROE from
Tennessee, my good friend BRADLEY
BYRNE from Alabama, and there have
been others—who have made this jour-
ney with the U.S. Israel Education As-
sociation from both the Senate and the
U.S. House.
It is just so marvelous to stand in
support of the U.S.-Israel relationship,
a decades-long partnership that under-
pins security in the Middle East and
promotes democratic flourishing
throughout the entire region at a time,
sadly, of heightened anti-Semitism
that we are seeing across the globe. It
is more important than ever that we
maintain this strong connection to this
very, very key ally of ours in Israel.
Israel is deeply invested in achieving
peace in the Middle East, and so is the
United States of America. We will al-
ways, all of us, stand collectively with
Israel as they work toward the achieve-
ment of this goal.
As my good friend BRADLEY BYRNE
from the great State of Alabama ex-
pressed, in August, we traveled as a
delegation and had the opportunity to
go to Israel with the U.S. Israel Edu-
cation Association and my colleagues.
We saw firsthand Israelis and Palestin-
ians working together to promote
peace and harmony.
We visited the capital of Samaria,
which BRADLEY BYRNE talked about,
which was Ariel, a town where we saw
Palestinians and Israelis working to-
gether in a true, integrated business
fashion. We spoke to both Jews and
Arabs who yearn for peace and pros-
perity for the region.
We explored an industrial park that
has upwards of 200 businesses where
Palestinians were, indeed, working
alongside Israelis. We spoke with those
employees. Many of the Palestinians
told us that they were making some-
where between three and four times
what they would otherwise earn if they
didn’t have this opportunity to have
the integrated business that we saw
going on in Ariel.
To provide for their families, and live
in peace and harmony, they were
standing up to what I would call
strong, divisive forces that seek to
vilify Israel and undermine its credi-
bility as a force for peace.
Yet, it is clear that both sides want
to find a solution to the bloodshed and
to the hate. People-to-people connec-
tions—and my friend Congressman
BYRNE said it so clearly and elo-
quently—between the Israelis and Pal-
estinians are building blocks of the en-
tire peace process. I am confident that
both communities are working to-
gether to improve a mutual under-
standing and expand economic pros-
pects for all citizens.
We did so many things in the area of
defense, our common defense with
Israel, getting to see some of the amaz-
ing work that the Israeli defense orga-
nization, working in conjunction with
the United States of America, was able
to do, especially when it came to the
Arrow-3 test that we saw, which was
just so fantastic. It just happened this
last July. That would take out a long-
range ballistic missile and keep us all
safe.
We also got to meet with Prime Min-
ister Netanyahu. We had a long discus-
sion about the West Bank and about
the time that we spent there inside the
West Bank, watching Israelis and Pal-
estinians working together in this inte-
grated fashion. I asked the Prime Min-
ister: Wow, so many of the myths have
been debunked. I want to go back with
this information, talk to my col-
leagues, and talk to my constituents.
What should we say?
The Prime Minister said: Tell their
truth.
I will also say this: With Iran work-
ing to destabilize the region and
threaten Israel through dangerous ter-
rorist proxies that we have seen in
Hezbollah and Hamas, it is essential
that we stand together with our ally. I
am committed, and I know that we all
are, to protecting our critical relation-
ship and strengthening the ties be-
tween the United States and Israel.
I also find it especially concerning
that anti-Israeli actors are seeking to
delegitimize and isolate the State of
Israel through the Boycott Divestment
and Sanctions, or BDS. I was very
proud to introduce legislation, H. Res.
246, with Representatives SCHNEIDER,
ZELDIN, and NADLER, a true bipartisan
effort that expresses Congress’ strong
support for Israel and condemns the
BDS movement.
I am happy to say that H. Res. 246
has been agreed to in the House with a
vote of 398 in support. I hope this sends
a clear message of support to the peo-
ple of Israel and also to those who
would maybe seek to undermine it.
We, in Congress, stand with Israel.
We will continue to work to strengthen
and deepen ties between our nations.
I am just so pleased that I had this
incredible opportunity to see business,
peace, prosperity, hope, and real people
who found their humanity and want to
live together in peace and harmony. To
be with these good people and to be on
this journey that was one of policy, one
of defense, it was also a spiritual jour-
ney that I think lifted us all up, heart-
ened us, and strengthened us.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Washington State, my
dear friend, CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS,
for leading us in this journey and for
her continued leadership in the work
that we are going to do to promote in-
tegrated business.
I look forward to her comments and
those of Dr. PHIL ROE. I am so grateful
to USIEA for this tremendous oppor-
tunity.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman
from Missouri. I thought she said it so
well. It really is an untold story. It is
a story of opportunity, and it is a story
of hope that, unfortunately, isn’t being
told right now.
This needs to be part of the peace
plan. We need to have and encourage
that economic cooperation between the
Israelis and the Palestinian business
leaders. We saw it, the Judea and Sa-
maria Chamber of Commerce coming
together and, in the last 2 years, cre-
ating jobs, creating opportunities, and
giving people hope.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. ROE).
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding.
It was, indeed, a privilege to be on
the trip with the group. It was a great
group.
I also thank our leader, CATHY
MCMORRIS RODGERS, for keeping a stiff
upper lip when her clothes didn’t get
there for a few days.
I was in Israel 10 years ago, so this
was my first trip back in 10 years. I
saw a dramatic change in that country.
I grew up on a farm, so I am very,
very interested in the agriculture in
that country. One of the things that I
saw that had changed in that country
was they had developed the ability to
desalinate seawater. Sixty percent of
the water that they get in that country
now is desalinated seawater. They are
able to take a desert and actually sus-
tain a fairly substantial population on
it.
When we visited the Sea of Galilee in
Tiberias, I also noticed that the Sea of
Galilee was up since the last time I was
there. It had actually come up. It had
a wet winter.
Up on the Golan, which overlooks the
Sea of Galilee, which the Israelis cap-
tured in the 1967 war, that is one of the
best agricultural areas in the Middle
East, probably. Let us not forget that
it is still a very dangerous piece of real
estate.
Most people don’t realize how small
that country actually is. There are
places in Israel from the Green Line.
That is the fence separating the Pales-
tinian Authority and Israel. It is 9
miles. One of the officials there laugh-
ingly said that when President George
Bush was there, he said: We have drive-
ways in Texas longer than that.
He is almost right. You don’t appre-
ciate how small that country is and
what they have been able to accom-
plish.
From an economic standpoint, I am a
former mayor, and one of the things as

a mayor that you do is try to develop
and sell your city and develop busi-
nesses in that city. What I saw was the
Judea and Samaria Chamber of Com-
merce did not exist when I was there 10
years ago. It is very new, 18 months
old. I am going to introduce them to
our Chamber of Commerce in the U.S.
so that they can get together.
You saw people—not nations, but
people—working together to make life
better for their community. This is
their home, and they want their home
to be as safe and good as it can be.
I want to say this about Mr. Jaber.
He is a very brave man. I told him that
not everybody agrees with what he is
doing in this, and he did not care. He
represented a large family in that re-
gion, in Hebron, where he is and where
his family resides.
What they want is they want free-
dom. They want the ability to work.
They want the ability to worship like
anybody else wants. They want the
same things you and I do.
In this piece of real estate, there are
a lot of bad actors there. If you go
down to the Gaza Strip, it is the pov-
erty that is there.
By the way, we know that in south-
ern Lebanon, where Hezbollah and Is-
lamic Jihad and other terrorist groups
live, Iran is funding those. Israel has to
deal with that.
We made a trip to Golan Heights. We
looked and could see a very green
Israel where it had been farmed and ir-
rigated, and we saw a very desolate
looking Syria, where there has been a
war for over 10 years. Five hundred
thousand people, the population of
Washington, D.C., had been killed there
during that civil war. It is really in-
credibly sad.
I think one of the things I looked at
was how you defend them. I am an old
second infantry guy in the Army, so
how do you defend this real estate?
We had an opportunity to meet with
some of the Israeli officials, and they
showed us their defense systems. Every
new home in that country built since
1998, I believe, has to have a safe room,
so a room that has reinforced concrete,
rebar, that you can get your family in
almost immediately.
We take these liberties and freedoms
that we have for granted in this coun-
try, where we are safe to go wherever
we want to go and drive where we want
to. We saw roads in areas that are
marked A, B, and C. In A area, a Jew
cannot go there. You are not allowed
to go there.
We have, in this country, been free
for a third century, and we don’t appre-
ciate that as much as when you go to
a place like that and realize you can’t
go exactly where you want to. There is
always a worry when you are on the
beach or out at dinner or at a res-
taurant with your family: Is this going
to be the night that a terrorist attack
occurs?
There was much improvement from
10 years ago.
With the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri, who I hope to get to see next
week in Missouri when I visit there, we
visited with her family and got to see
some of the most amazing sights. From
my standpoint as a Christian, it was
incredibly uplifting to me to walk on
the steps where Jesus walked, to be
able to see where Abraham, perhaps,
almost sacrificed Jacob.
We saw a lot of those areas that we
read about but had never really seen
them. It really brought the Bible to life
for me. That was really good.
Meeting with the Prime Minister, he
spent an enormous amount of time,
considering what was on his plate—an
election. He had that on his plate, but
he was very generous with his time.
b 1830
He spent a lot of time considering
what was on his plate: an election. He
had that on his plate, but he was very
generous with his time. I remember
asking him, I said: What keeps you up
at night? What wakes you up?
And it didn’t take him 2 seconds. He
said: The red phone, because there is
almost not a night that he is not deal-
ing with something incredibly serious
in that small country.
So I wish them well, and I certainly
would encourage others to study this
part of the country. It is an amazing
country.
I will say this: There for thousands of
years. And we saw artifacts and build-
ings that were thousands of years old.
We think of our country being 300
years old or 400 years old, and this area
is thousands of years old. So anything
that you dig in Jerusalem, especially,
you are going to find something when
you dig under the ground that has been
there for many years.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his
comments. That was great to hear.
I often tell people, everyone should
go to Israel. There really is no other
place like it in all of the world. And it
is at the center of history from a Bib-
lical perspective, the history, but
today, so much of what is happening in
the world is centered on what is going
on in Israel. So it was great to be able
to return to Israel for me.
I have traveled with the U.S. Israel
Education Association before, and I am
grateful for them leading these trips,
especially behind the Green Line into
Judea and Samaria, and taking Mem-
bers of Congress, House and Senate,
Republicans and Democrats, to be able
to see it for themselves. It really is im-
portant.
We spent a couple of days beyond the
Green Line, so that is in the West
Bank, and we were witnessing amazing
cooperation between the Palestinians
and the Israelis. I feel like, for me, it is
the untold story, and it is a story
about opportunity. It doesn’t always
make the headlines or the news, the
cable news. It is a story of hope at a
time when too many despair.
So I think the gentlewoman men-
tioned we went to the city of Ariel.
Ariel is the capital of Samaria. It is a
city right now that is booming with
housing, shopping centers, more jobs.
We went to Ariel University. It is the
newest university in Israel. It is a lead-
er in science and technology.
I was especially impressed with the
program that they had for those with
autism, giving those with autism an
opportunity to earn a degree. They are
also building a new medical school.
Ariel University is a leading model,
where Jews, Arabs, and diverse stu-
dents from across Israel come to study
and to learn together, to build that op-
portunity for a better life.
Down the road from Ariel University,
we toured the business park. There was
a large business park. We toured one
factory that is processing 50 tons of
tahini a day, and they want to double
that very soon.
In that town is where we saw the
Israelis and the Palestinians working
together. We saw neighborhoods where
they are living together with equal op-
portunities, equal pay, equal benefits.
The waiting list to get a job is over
1,000 people long. And why is that? Be-
cause they are going to make three to
four times what they could make any-
where else that is controlled by the
Palestinian Authority.
Now, everything that comes out of
that business park is considered BDS.
So why would Palestinians want to
risk working at a place that everything
is going to be stamped ‘‘BDS’’—and
that is actually against the law. It is
because they want to be able to provide
for their families and live a full life.
So one Palestinian employee in Ariel
said this: ‘‘All the people I know in the
factory or outside it, they believe that
the commercial progress will bring sta-
bility, a comfortable life.
‘‘Why not work together in peace?
You can see good examples of friend-
ship and peace here.
‘‘In the territories that are under the
control of the Palestinian Authorities
in the West Bank, we don’t have fac-
tories like this factory. If you want to
work in a factory over there, you will
not get the salary we get here. It’s not
enough for the necessity of life.
‘‘Here, we get a comfortable and re-
spectable salary.’’
That is the reality on the ground in
the West Bank. Jews and Arabs from
Israel and Palestine are working and
living together today in peace.
I was reminded again that it is the
opportunity: It is the opportunity for a
good-paying job. It is the chance for
your children to get a good education.
It is the desire for hope, peace, and
security that drives all of us. It really
is foundational for every person, no
matter their background or their walk
of life.
I was also reminded of this in He-
bron. And in Hebron, we did make his-
tory. That picture was the first time
that a group of Members of Congress
had traveled to a Palestinian business
leader’s home, Ashraf Jabari, and he
warmly invited us into his home. He
told us that he wants to be a partner

for peace with America in the Middle
East.
Mrs. WAGNER. Will the gentle-
woman yield?
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. I
yield to the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, we hope
that he would be coming along with
the Judea and Samaria Chamber of
Commerce to the United States to also
tell their story to Congress and to our
other colleagues. Mr. Jabari welcomed
us into his home, and we can’t wait to
welcome the sheikh here to tell this
great story of partnership and inte-
grated business and working together.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.
This picture is a picture of the lead-
ers of the Judea and Samaria Chamber
of Commerce. There are 150 Israeli
business leaders and 150 Palestinian
business leaders coming together. They
formed the Judea and Samaria Cham-
ber of Commerce 2 years ago, and, yes,
we want to invite them to come to Cap-
itol Hill, to visit with Members of Con-
gress, to tell their story, because it is
an untold story, and it needs to be told.
They believe that this has to be part
of the peace solution. It is the bottom-
up grassroots movement where people
are living together, working together,
and they are doing it. And that is the
way that we are going to build peace.
So it was really encouraging to see
that economic activity.
One of the things that I remember
Ashraf saying was:
Our truth and our reality is that the Pal-
estinians and the Israelis work together. We
want to show the world that reality.
So that is why we are excited about
them coming and being able to host
them here in Congress and being able
to introduce them and have them tell
their story.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘tell
their truth’’ is what the Prime Min-
ister said. That is so important. We
look forward to it.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, another aspect of this does
deal with the BDS movement, the Boy-
cott, Divestment and Sanctions move-
ment that we see right now. It has a
goal of delegitimizing Israel.
We heard from the factory workers,
the business leaders like Ashraf, and
the Judea and Samaria Chamber of
Commerce. We saw a different story
where they are really working together
in peace, and that economic relation-
ship must be foundational to peace.
For the Palestinians and the Israelis,
though, BDS is going to threaten it.
Both the Palestinian business leaders
as well as the Palestinian workers told
us that BDS actually hurts them more
than the Israelis because, for the first
time, they have an opportunity for a
really good-paying job, to be able to
provide for their families, to be able to
make sure that their kids are getting a
good education. That is their dream.
That is what gives them hope.
So it hurts them. It hurts their abil-
ity to work, to provide for their fami-
lies. They want economic freedom, not
boycotts. And this desire is over-
whelming.
That is why I am proud of the leader-
ship of my colleague, the gentlewoman
from Missouri, ANN WAGNER, in leading
the resolution that passed here on the
House floor, overwhelmingly, a state-
ment that we do not stand for Boycott,
Divestment and Sanctions, BDS, that
this is actually going to work against
peace.
What we saw, what we witnessed,
that is the foundation for peace and
must be a part of any of the peace plan
moving forward.
So I believe that, as America con-
tinues to influence and encourage this
kind of grassroots movement, we are
going to see growing economic oppor-
tunity that is foundational, that is
vital for Israel’s future, but also for the
Palestinian people.
Israel is our greatest ally, our great-
est friend in the Middle East. They are
also vital for America. So I am going
to be encouraging, and I know my fel-
low colleagues who traveled with me,
we are going to be talking to the ad-
ministration and Jared Kushner about
the peace plan that is being developed
right now and urging them to include,
in any kind of a peace plan, this eco-
nomic cooperation and America stand-
ing in support of this bottom-up grass-
roots approach that really makes a dif-
ference in people’s lives.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, if I
could add one thing while we are hav-
ing this colloquy in this terrific Spe-
cial Order, we were all grateful for the
opportunity that USIEA gave us.
I want to thank—I think we all want
to thank—Heather Johnston for her
leadership. Thanks to General Krulak
for his leadership and their entire team
that made this experience possible,
that has worked so diligently and so
fervently to bring peace to Israel, to
put forward the peace process through
things like integrated business, to rec-
ognize the strong defense ally and part-
nership that we have with Israel, and
that some $3.3 million of U.S. taxpayer
funds that we share jointly with Israel
in order to lift up their defense system
so that we are all safe in this world
and, certainly, in this delicate part of
the Middle East.
So I want to thank those leaders of
USIEA and, again, the gentlewoman
from Washington for bringing us on
this tremendous journey. We hope to
share it with many others.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, I completely agree. That is a
good point. A big thank-you to Heather
Johnston, who led, and General
Krulak, former Commandant of the
Marine Corps, Joint Chiefs of Staff,
who is helping encourage this eco-
nomic, integrated business approach.
We also got to, as the gentlewoman
said, see Arrow 3. Also traveling with
us was Ari Sacher, who led the whole
Iron Dome.
I always take pleasure in noting
that, under his leadership, Israel was
able to develop Iron Dome in less than
3 years, under budget. That is some-
thing we could take note of. And it is
working, and they are using it today
and every day.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, just to continue with Mr.
Jabari, to put this in perspective for
people. He worked for the Palestinian
Authority for over 10 years as one of
their security people. He saw it was not
working.
He pointed out, when we were in his
home: We had a 4-year election 15 years
ago. This term of the leadership was
supposed to be for 4 years, and that was
15 years ago.
So they knew they had no power.
They had elected these folks, and he
saw his people were not improving;
their plight was not improving. So he
thought: I am going to do something
different.
And that is exactly what he struck
out. And as I said, this gentleman right
here on this photo is a very brave man,
and I wish him nothing but the abso-
lute best.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, Mr. Jabari had courage and
bravery.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I think he had his people at
heart and his family at heart and the
Palestinians at heart, and I see nothing
but good things if peace can break out.
Another thing we did that I think
was extremely important was go to the
training center and visit there. This is
a leadership training center. Some
60,000 people have been through it in
Israel.
The day we were there, there were a
group of Palestinian Girl Scouts there
team building, and it was fun to kind
of watch them.
I was actually much happier watch-
ing them on the ground. They were
climbing up on these ropes and every-
thing.
But they were there with their Scout
leader going through the leadership
training. This is building bonds and
friendship that will, hopefully, last for
generations.
I think the other thing that the Pal-
estinian Authority, that Mr. Jabari
pointed out, he said that, of all the
money that the United States has
given the Palestinian Authority, they
have not built one school or one hos-
pital for the people.
So where did the money go?
We heard that day when we were
there that there is actually a bounty
from the Palestine Authority if you
kill a Jew, if you kill another human
being, that your family that is left is
given money each month.
b 1845
That is very difficult to get to a
peaceful situation, and that is why I
am so respectful of Mr. Jabari, because
he put himself in harm’s way to try to
make the plight of his people better.
And he is doing it.
A couple of other things that I think
we learned on this trip was how many

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8050 September 26, 2019
businesses are thriving in Israel. So the
next time you get in your car, Mr.
Speaker, and you start driving down
the road, and your car automatically
brakes, your steering wheel shakes
when you get out of the lane as you
look at your cellphone—and you
shouldn’t—this driverless car tech-
nology was developed in Israel. I think
Intel has now bought the company. So
when you see a car driving without
anybody in it, that technology began
in Israel.
Another thing that really surprised
me that is a difference, it is a game
changer in that country, was the fact
that they discovered natural gas. They
are now a net exporter of energy. They
actually export to Egypt. So it really
stabilized them from an energy stand-
point where they are not so dependent.
America’s independence also contrib-
utes to their safety.
Let me go over why that is impor-
tant. Forty-plus years ago, we had an
oil embargo by OPEC in this country.
We had lines. Every other day we had
to get in a line to get gas. I happened
to be a young Army officer 11 miles
south of the DMZ in Korea during the
winter. We got heat 3 hours a day be-
cause of this embargo. We had to use
our fuel for our tanks, Cobra gunships,
Huey helicopters, and other equipment
that we had. So we didn’t have any to
heat the place we were in, and it was
incredibly miserable there.
I saw oil used as a political weapon
back then. The fact is that this coun-
try is now energy independent. We had
three huge tankers get diverted by
Iran. We had an attack that took out
almost 6 million barrels of oil a day.
Because of the energy policies in this
country, there was hardly a hiccup. I
can tell you, Mr. Speaker, if we had
been in the same situation 40 years
ago, gas would have been two or three
times what it is. It would have created
great hardships in this country.
So the fact is that Israel is there
helping. They are making friends. They
have a great partnership. I give Presi-
dent Carter a shout-out. Anwar Sadat
died because of that partnership that
occurred, and peace has broken out be-
tween the Israelis, the Egyptians, and
the Jordanians.
Do they still have differences?
Yes. But they are civil to each other,
and they are working those differences
out. Saudi Arabia—who would have
ever thought—I remember Prime Min-
ister Netanyahu said: Who would have
ever thought Israeli airplanes would be
flying over Saudi Arabia?
They are now. So you can see a
change that has occurred in the last 10
years that I found astonishing.
Mrs. WAGNER. Will the gentle-
woman yield?
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. I
yield to the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, the eco-
nomic summit that was pulled together
where so many Arabs came and partici-
pated was all a lead-up to a peace proc-
ess and the kind of work that we are
seeing that is happening in the West
Bank. We hope that it will continue to
flourish. The peace process is some-
thing that I know that Jared Kushner,
our White House, USIEA, the Israeli
Government, the Palestinians, and oth-
ers are working on. It is something
that I think will be the basis and the
underpinning of the peace process.
As we have all expressed, we see peo-
ple find the humanity, find that all
they want is what we all want: to be
safe and secure, to take care of our
families, to give back to society, to be
productive, to be able to worship in the
fashion that we choose, and to have
some freedom. That is what we hope
for Israel long-term.
It was just wonderful to be a part of
this journey. I look forward to the fu-
ture, what this administration is going
to bring to the table, and to those who
will be coming to, I hope, educate our
colleagues on the important work that
is being done.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, we should also recognize the
extraordinary leadership of Ambas-
sador David Friedman. We had the op-
portunity to have lunch with him. We
had the opportunity to visit the United
States Embassy in Jerusalem.
Mrs. WAGNER. A first. A promise
that was made and kept, finally, by an
American President, President Trump.
It is great.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. It
was a beautiful day when we were
there. It was just great to be able to
spend some time with him. He really
has led the way within the administra-
tion with integrated business. Also he
sees the vision, and he sees the poten-
tial of what that means as far as help-
ing really forge peace from a bottom-
up approach. So it was great to be with
him.
I appreciated Dr. ROE talking about
the national training center which is
leading with training, leadership, and
teamwork that we all can benefit from.
They have contracted with the IDF.
They have contracts now with the De-
partment of Education. We saw the
young people—the Israelis and the
Arabs—going through this training to-
gether—thousands.
Mrs. WAGNER. Tens of thousands. It
was amazing.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. It
was so encouraging to see that during
our time there.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, one of the young ladies took a
lot of encouragement. I do remember
that. She was having a hard time, but
she made it across finally.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. I re-
member that, too.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, Mrs. WAGNER mentioned that
I hope that the Palestinians find peace
and prosperity. They have long suf-
fered, and many in Gaza still do. In He-
bron where Mr. Jabari was, peace and
prosperity is breaking out there.
I wish them nothing but the best, and
I hope they are successful in their en-
deavor.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, when you think about Israel,
it is a very young country. It is just
over 70 years old. It is very impressive
from a defense perspective, from a
technology perspective, and from an
agriculture perspective leading the
world in so many different fields.
I also believe it is always important
to highlight they are the only democ-
racy in the Middle East. They are our
best friend. Its history and its culture
are the center of our civilization. Israel
faces threats every single day against
its survival and against the universal
values of peace, security, opportunity,
and, of course, freedom.
Those values unite us in America and
in Israel on both sides of the Green
Line. I am excited that my colleagues
are here to share with everyone our ex-
perience. We returned home with a
strong conviction that this story needs
to be told and that more of our col-
leagues, Republicans and Democrats,
need to see it for themselves. That was
the biggest takeaway we heard after
listening to the people whom we met.
They asked us to go home and share
their reality and their desires to pro-
mote peace and economic security in
Israel. That is our mission today.
Mrs. WAGNER. As I said, Mr. Speak-
er, I just thank the gentlewoman from
Washington so much for her leadership
and that of the USIEA. To go on this
journey is wonderful, and we look for-
ward to the future.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I say God bless the Palestin-
ians and Israelis. We wish them noth-
ing but the best.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Well
said.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SCOTT of Florida). The majority leader
is recognized.
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, ex-
actly 1 year ago, the administration
announced the most significant trade
deal in a generation—a landmark
agreement with Mexico and Canada to
strengthen two of our Nation’s key
trading relationships.
The USMCA is the most consequen-
tial update of trade policy on this con-
tinent in a quarter century. It is a huge
opportunity to notch new pro-Amer-
ican policy victories and keep our
North American neighbors close while
we tackle other challenges, such as
China.
Here we are, months after all three
countries’ leaders signed the agree-
ment, and we are still waiting on the
House Democrats to let it move for-
ward. Mexico has already passed it, and
Canada is waiting on our move. The
Senate is ready and eager to ratify it,
but the Senate can’t go first. The clock
is ticking.
Month after month, even as the
House Democrats have continually
made vague statements that they sup-
port the USMCA and want to see it
passed, we have yet to see any real
progress. Canada, Mexico, and millions
of Americans are waiting for Speaker
PELOSI to remember that serving the
public interest requires more than just
picking fights with the President; it
actually entails addressing the people’s
business.
Mexico and Canada are vital partners
at every level of the U.S. economy.
They provide enormous, growing mar-
kets for American-made products.
They, together, buy more than $500 bil-
lion in U.S. goods and services every
single year. It is a half-a-trillion-dollar
export market. Every State, every in-
dustry, every corner of our country is
involved.
For 90 percent of America’s manufac-
turing sectors, Mexico or Canada ranks
as the No. 1 or No. 2 export destination.
For American farmers and producers,
our two neighbors buy almost two-
thirds of all the agricultural exports
we sell to all of our free-trade partners
combined. We aren’t just talking about
Big Business. Tens of thousands of
small- and medium-sized businesses
count on their Mexican or Canadian
customers to succeed.
These realities affect Americans’ real
lives. In the last 25 years, as trade with
Mexico and Canada has quadrupled, 12
million U.S. jobs have come to depend
on cross-border commerce. Many of

those jobs belong to workers in Ken-
tucky, where our biggest industries,
from auto manufacturing to bourbon
production, depend on this export econ-
omy.
With so much at stake, the American
people deserve to have an excellent
trade deal in place, one that levels the
playing field for American workers and
reduces the incentives to ship Amer-
ican jobs to Mexico and one that ex-
pands American farmers’ and manufac-
turers’ access to these neighboring
markets.
This is exactly what the USMCA de-
livers. It upgrades the playing field for
American workers, farmers, ranchers,
and job creators. It builds on the pro-
growth, pro-innovation policies that
encourage their success here at home
with an upgraded, modern runway to
markets beyond our borders.
The USMCA looks specifically at key
sectors where outdated rules or
exploitive practices threaten Ameri-
cans’ job security and hurt homegrown
industries. It strengthens intellectual
property rights to protect American in-
novation; it upgrades our digital trade
policy; and the USMCA wins greater
market access for U.S. exporters, with
there being opportunities to sell more
dairy and poultry into Canada, a better
playing field for auto parts and invest-
ment, and enforceable labor standards
so hard-working Americans aren’t un-
fairly priced out of their jobs.
What does all of this add up to? I will
tell you. According to the independent
U.S. International Trade Commission,
the USMCA would generate more than
$68 billion in GDP growth and create
176,000 jobs right here in the United
States.
Frankly, there is very little else we
could do in Congress that would deliver
this kind of boost to American pros-
perity and brighten prospects for so
many American families. It is also a
bipartisan deal. It includes changes
that the Democrats have themselves
clamored for and for which the admin-
istration has bent over backward to ac-
commodate their concerns.
Here we are, a year after all three
countries announced the deal, and the
Democrats’ heel-dragging continues.
Speaker PELOSI keeps saying she sup-
ports the agreement in the abstract,
but the drip, drip, drip of small objec-
tions and stalling tactics keeps on
coming. Even as Speaker PELOSI’s mod-
erate Members publicly beg her to pass
this deal, it is almost as though she is
looking for reasons to duck it.
Well, I certainly hope not, for 176,000
American jobs hang in the balance,
tens of billions of dollars of new pros-
perity, and our relationships with two
of our closest allies that have already
taken difficult steps to get to yes on
this agreement and whose support we
need to preserve a system of free and
fair trade from China’s aggressive ef-
forts to rewrite the rules on its own
terms.
The United States of America needs
this deal. American workers and small
businesses need this deal. The time for
excuses is over. The USMCA needs to
move this fall, and that can’t happen
until the House Democrats stop block-
ing an enormous win for our country.
TRIBUTE TO ILEANA GARCIA
Mr. President, on a totally different
matter, as majority leader, I am espe-
cially grateful for opportunities to
offer the Senate’s thanks to the re-
markable men and women who work
tirelessly to preserve and protect this
great institution.
On Monday, we will be saying a bit-
tersweet goodbye to a particularly irre-
placeable member of the Senate’s fam-
ily who has worked alongside us for 22
years.
Ileana Garcia was born in Cuba and
raised in Puerto Rico. She started
working for the Secretary of the Sen-
ate in September 1997 as a project ac-
countant.
Since then she has built a remark-
able success story here in this institu-
tion, rising through the ranks of finan-
cial management and becoming finan-
cial clerk of the Senate in 2014.
But with Ileana, it is not just about
the impressive milestones. It is about
the outsized impact she has had on this
place and so many people—from the
heavy lifting of getting a new financial
system online in the late 1990s to help-
ing offices navigate healthcare transi-
tions and government shutdowns, to
the everyday challenges that come
with a big complicated payroll like the
U.S. Senate’s.
She did it all with professionalism
and attention to detail. At times, my
own staff observed that she was so at-
tentive and so quick to respond to
their questions that they wondered if
she was detailed exclusively to handle
our office. Of course she wasn’t. That is
just the job she does.
But professionalism and excellence
aren’t the only things Ileana brought
into the office every day. Everyone ob-
serves that she also brought a very big
heart. Patience, discretion, compas-
sion, and an unflagging smile have
been her calling cards. That was the
case when she arrived 22 years ago, and
it remains the case today as she pre-
pares to depart as one of the Senate’s
senior-most administrative staffers.
So we are really sorry to lose some-
body of Ileana’s caliber, but we know
she is excited to spend more time on
Planet Garcia, which I understand is
what she and her beloved husband Ariel
of 30 years call their clan, including
their three sons. And I understand
there might be some more time for
competitive domino tournaments—not
that she apparently needs any more
practice.
So I know that all of my colleagues
will join me today in wishing Ileana
Garcia the very best and thanking her
for a job so well done.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, after
Speaker PELOSI decided to open a for-
mal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday
evening, there have been several devel-
opments. Yesterday, the President re-
leased a memorandum of conversation
of his July 25 call with President
Zelensky of Ukraine. In plain text—
plain text—no ands, ifs, or buts, the
President pressured the leader of
Ukraine to investigate one of his lead-
ing political rivals, confirming public
reports.
Yesterday, as well, the House and
Senate Intelligence Committees re-
ceived the official whistleblower com-
plaint that precipitated this series of
events. I read the complaint yesterday
afternoon and came away more con-
cerned—even more concerned than
when I had read the memorandum of
the President’s conversation.
This morning, the House Intelligence
Committee made public the declas-
sified portion of the complaint and the
intelligence community’s inspector
general’s cover letter. That was the
correct decision. The American people
have a right to read the whistle-
blower’s complaint for themselves, and
I hope that they will.
The whistleblower’s complaint be-
gins:
In the course of my official duties, I have
received information from multiple U.S.
Government officials that the President of
the United States is using the power of his
office to solicit interference from a foreign
country in the 2020 U.S. election. This inter-
ference includes, among others things, pres-
suring a foreign country to investigate one
of the President’s main domestic political ri-
vals.
Those are his words.
The complaint goes on to describe
specific, deliberate maneuvers by
White House lawyers and officials to
lock down records of the Presidential
communications in question, including
and especially ‘‘the official word-for-
word transcript of the President’s
phone call with President Zelensky.’’
The whistleblower complaint con-
tains allegations of underlying crimes,
a campaign of soliciting the inter-
ference of a foreign government in an
American election, and using the power
of an official government position for
personal and political gain, as well as
many allegations of an attempted
coverup.
If this was all so innocent, why did so
many officials in the White House, in
the Justice Department, and elsewhere
make such large efforts to prevent it
from being made public?
Both sets of allegations are said to
have multiple witnesses and multiple
co-collaborators. If confirmed, the alle-
gations contained in the whistleblower

complaint are nothing short of explo-
sive. The complaint unquestionably
validated Speaker PELOSI’s decision to
open a formal impeachment inquiry
into these matters.
We are living in an incredibly deli-
cate time for our democracy. We have
a responsibility now to corroborate the
facts in the whistleblower’s complaint,
solicit testimony from those involved,
and pursue the relevant avenues of in-
quiry that arise.
We have a responsibility to consider
the facts that emerge squarely and
with the best interests of our country,
not our party, in our hearts. We have a
responsibility not to rush to final judg-
ment or overstate the case, not to let
ourselves be ruled by passion but by
reason. For if the House, at the end of
its inquiry, sees fit to accuse the Presi-
dent of impeachable offenses, we in the
Senate will act as jury. Our role as the
solemn jurors of democracy demands
that we place fidelity to country and
fidelity to our Constitution above all
else.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, on the Appropriations
Committee, the business of the Amer-
ican people and the responsibilities of
Congress do not pause while the House
prepares to formally begin an impeach-
ment inquiry. Today, for example, the
Senate must pass a continuing resolu-
tion to keep the government open
through the end of November and give
appropriators time to complete the 12
appropriations bills.
I expect the continuing resolution
will pass this morning and head to the
President’s desk. That is the easy part.
The hard part is getting a bipartisan
appropriations process back on track
here in the Senate.
Senate Republicans unilaterally de-
parted from our bipartisan negotia-
tions earlier this month by proposing
to divert as much as $12 billion from
military construction and health pro-
grams to the President’s border wall.
Obviously that was a nonstarter with
Democrats, and the Republican leader
and the leaders of the Appropriations
Committee on the Republican side had
to know that. As yesterday’s vote for
the national emergency declaration
showed, it is a nonstarter with a dou-
ble-digit number of Republicans as
well.
Now that Republican leaders have
shown the President they tried to get
his wall again, now that the Senate has
taken two proxy votes on the wall
again this work period, neither of
which came close to passing, it is time
for Leader MCCONNELL, Chairman
SHELBY, and our Republican colleagues
on the Appropriations Committee to
sit down with Democrats and get a bi-
partisan process moving again.
NOMINATION OF EUGENE SCALIA
Mr. President, finally, on the Scalia
nomination, today the Senate will con-
sider the nomination of Eugene Scalia
to serve as Secretary of Labor. Typical
of the Trump administration, Mr.
Scalia’s nomination is a slap to the
face of labor because Mr. Scalia’s life
work has been utterly opposed to the
mission of the agency to which he is
nominated. He has sided repeatedly
with the large corporate interests
against working people.
If any working person doubts that
President Trump does not have their
interests at heart, look at who he has
nominated. This guy shouldn’t even
make it for Secretary of Commerce, let
alone Secretary of Labor, which is sup-
posed to defend and protect the work-
ing people of America.
President Trump could have chosen a
card-carrying union member for the
job. He could have chosen someone who
understands the needs of workers and
unions, the history of the labor move-
ment, and the established right of
workers to collectively bargain for bet-
ter wages and safer conditions. Instead,
President Trump nominated Mr.
Scalia, a corporate lawyer who has
spent his entire career protecting the
interests of CEOs, big corporations,
and the wealthy elite—not workers,
not labor. Worse, he has proactively
fought to weaken worker protections.
He has opposed minimum wage in-
creases and even opposed protections in
the Americans with Disabilities Act. It
is a disgrace.
My guess is that if every working
person knew Mr. Scalia’s record and
that President Trump nominated him,
Mr. Trump would hardly get the vote
of a worker. This shows who President
Trump is. This shows who our Repub-
lican colleagues are. They talk about
the rights of workers but vote for
somebody—I hope they won’t, but in
all likelihood, they will vote for some-
body who is anti-worker up and down
in the very bones of his body.
Mr. Scalia is part of a larger pattern.
President Trump has claimed to be a
champion for working Americans, but
he has filled our government with mil-
lionaires and CEOs and folks like
Scalia who work for them with proven
records of putting corporate interests
before workers’ interests. Anyone who
thinks President Trump is a friend of
the working person should look at
Scalia’s nomination.
The Republican majority, rather
than use its advice and consent powers
to check the President when he does
the wrong thing, rolls over and ap-
proves these nominees.
Do all of these Republicans here op-
pose the Americans with Disabilities
Act? Do all of these Republicans oppose
increasing the minimum wage? Well, if
you are against those kinds of things,
vote for him. But we have gotten a lot
of doubletalk, people who say they are
for those things and then vote for
nominees who oppose them and rip
them apart.
We should not confirm Mr. Scalia as
Secretary of Labor, and I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this nomination.
I yield the floor.

HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are a
proud nation of immigrants and have
benefited from the diversity of ideas
and cultures that have come from
around the world to experience the
freedoms that we enjoy in the United
States of America.
September 15 through October 15 is
Hispanic Heritage Month and a time to
especially celebrate the traditions and
contributions of the tens of millions of
Hispanic and Latino Americans across
our country.
Texas is home to more than 11 mil-
lion Hispanic Americans. Some have
lived here for generations, and others
have contributed to the recent rapid
growth of the Lone Star State.
Throughout our State’s history, we
have benefited from the leadership of
people like Dr. Hector Garcia, a sur-
geon, a decorated World War II vet-
eran, and a civil rights advocate. He
founded the American GI Forum to en-
sure that veterans receive equal bene-
fits and care regardless of their race or
ethnicity. He was an ardent advocate
for equal educational opportunities,
and his motto was ‘‘Education is our
freedom, and freedom should be
everybody’s business.’’
Dr. Garcia became the first Mexican
American to serve as the Ambassador
to the United Nations, representing our
country on the world stage. President
Ronald Reagan later bestowed upon
him the Presidential Medal of Free-
dom. His legacy is a reminder of what
a single person can accomplish in the
face of adversity, if only they have the
courage to fight for what is right.
Today, Texas is proud to have incred-
ible Hispanic-American leaders across
our State, including Ruth Hughs, who
last month was sworn in as our sec-
retary of state, and people like Justice
Eva Guzman, who is the first Hispanic
woman to serve on the Texas Supreme
Court.
There are incredible organizations,
such as the Hispanic chambers of com-
merce, that advocate for Hispanic-
owned small businesses that are vital
to our economy. There is also the
League of United Latin American Citi-
zens—or, as we know it, LULAC—that
fights to improve opportunities for His-
panic Americans, particularly when it
comes to education.
Hispanic leaders can be found in city
halls, board rooms, and communities
throughout our State and are improv-
ing our State in big ways and small
ones as well.
I have the honor of representing 28
million Texans—and it is growing by
about 1,000 people a day, but nearly 40
percent of them identify as Hispanic.
When Texans come to Washington,
they have the opportunity to visit the
museums that hold some of the most
important stories and artifacts from
our Nation’s history. In recent years,
we have made two very important addi-
tions to the Smithsonian Institution
with the National Museum of the
American Indian and the National Mu-
seum of African American History and

Culture. But it is time for another ad-
dition.
Earlier this year, I introduced the
National Museum of the American
Latino Act, which would authorize the
Smithsonian Institution to create a
museum honoring America’s Latinos.
This has been a work in progress since
2003, when a bill was introduced to
study the creation of a museum. The
process took a step forward in 2008,
when a Commission was established to
study the viability of such a museum
and, again, when that Commission re-
leased a report detailing the feasibility
of the project.
This legislation will take the work
that has been done up to this point and
finally put into motion the process of
establishing a Latino museum. As of
this week, we have 200 cosponsors on
the House companion legislation and
nearly 20 bipartisan cosponsors here in
the Senate. Bicameral, bipartisan sup-
port demonstrates that the time has
come to turn the dream of this mu-
seum into a reality.
Hispanic Americans have made innu-
merable contributions to our country,
and these stories deserve a brick and
mortar home here in Washington, DC,
in our Nation’s Capital.
Our State and our Nation are strong-
er, smarter, and more inclusive because
of the contributions of generations of
Hispanic Americans. So I am glad to
spend this month reflecting on the
work they have done and celebrating
the heritage that is uniquely woven
into the fabric of the United States of
America.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the past 2
weeks have provided a kind of micro-
cosm of the Democrat Party since the
2016 election—a combination of un-
hinged partisanship and a radical shift
to the far left.
In the past 2 weeks, we have seen
Democrats call for not one but two im-
peachments—Justice Kavanaugh’s and
the President’s—and introduce another
socialist-inspired, government-run ap-
proach to healthcare, this time on the
issue of prescription drugs.
First, there were the calls to impeach
Justice Kavanaugh based on yet an-
other vague rumor. It quickly became
glaringly obvious that there was no
substance to the rumor. The alleged
victim apparently has zero memory of
the alleged behavior, but that didn’t
give Democrats any pause. It was right
on to the next rushed impeachment
proposal.
On Tuesday, the Speaker of the
House announced that she was opening
an impeachment inquiry into the
President. Never mind that the Presi-
dent had declared he would make pub-
lic the transcript of the phone call in
question. Apparently, she couldn’t take
the time to wait. After all, as the lead-
er pointed out on the floor this week,
Democrats have been looking to im-
peach the President since the moment
he was elected.
For Democrats, impeachment is not
something to be gravely considered as
an answer to serious crimes; it is a po-
litical weapon they hope to use to fix
the fact that they didn’t get their way
in the last Presidential election. Demo-
crats’ calls for impeachment have
come so thick and fast over the past
couple of years, it would be difficult to
trust them to conduct an impeachment
investigation if there ever were a seri-
ous reason to consider one. They have
made it absolutely clear that they have
no objectivity at all.
In addition to poisonous partisan-
ship, the other thing that has charac-
terized the Democratic Party since the
2016 election is a rapid swing to the ex-
treme left. Last week, Speaker PELOSI
introduced the latest addition to the
socialist agenda Democrats have been
laying out over the past year—a pre-
scription drug bill that abandons the
free market and competition that have
enabled the United States to lead the
way in drug innovation and lifesaving
cures for Americans.
There is no question that many
Americans face high prescription drug
costs, and there is no question that we
can and should implement measures to
drive down these costs. For months,
the Senate Finance Committee, the
Senate Health, Education, Labor, and
Pensions Committee, and the Senate
Judiciary Committee have been work-
ing on this issue. The same is true in
the House.
There are multiple bipartisan ideas
both houses of Congress could act on,
but Speaker PELOSI’s bill is not the an-
swer to the problem of high drug costs.
The Speaker’s bill would force drug
companies to either accept government
price controls or face up to a 95-percent
tax on the sale of their drugs. That is
right, 95 percent. This is not a good-
faith effort to come to the table to talk
about solutions for lowering drug
prices and out-of-pocket costs for
Americans.
Right now, America is a leader in
prescription drug innovation and the
development of new treatments. The
Speaker’s bill would threaten all of
that. Under her bill, research into new
treatments and cures would decrease.
Yes, we need to address high drug
prices, but discouraging the innovation
that has improved the lives of so many
Americans is not the way to go about
it. The Speaker’s proposal for govern-
ment-run prescription drug prices
would do exactly what Democrats’
larger socialist healthcare fantasy
would do, and that is to hurt Ameri-
cans’ healthcare.
It would add limited healthcare inno-
vation to the many negatives Ameri-
cans would experience under so-called
Medicare for All—negatives such as re-
duced access to care, limited treatment
options, long wait times, and big tax
bills for ordinary Americans.
Of course, Democrats like to talk
about forcing the wealthy to pay for
Medicare for All and their other pie-in-
the-sky proposals. The junior Senator
from Vermont recently introduced a
wealth tax he wants to use to pay for
some of his special socialist programs.
His proposal would ostensibly raise
$4.35 trillion over 10 years. Here is the
problem. Let’s suppose he put all that
money toward paying for his govern-
ment-run takeover of healthcare, Medi-
care for All. At a conservative esti-
mate, Medicare for All would cost $32
trillion over 10 years—$32 trillion. The
Senator from Vermont’s wealth tax
wouldn’t even cover 15 percent of that
cost. Who is going to pay the other 85
percent? And that is supposing his
wealth tax actually raises the money
he says it will.
European countries have repealed
their wealth taxes right and left be-
cause they were ineffective. While I am
sure the Senator from Vermont would
be happy to levy additional taxes on
the wealthy, the truth is, there simply
aren’t enough wealthy people in the
United States to pay for all of the
Democrats’ socialist proposals. Ulti-
mately, the burden for paying for these
proposals would fall heavily on the
middle class.
There is no question that divided
government can make things chal-
lenging, but it can also be the occasion
for real, bipartisan action. Senate Re-
publicans would love to work with
Democrats on solutions to problems
like the cost of healthcare. Unfortu-
nately, Democrats have chosen to
spend most of their time on partisan
messaging and on proposing socialist
fantasies that would hurt the very peo-
ple they are supposed to help. I don’t
have a lot of confidence they will
change anytime soon, but I hope they
will. There is a lot we could still get
done if Democrats are willing to come
to the table and work with Republicans
on solutions that will meet the chal-
lenges faced by the American people.

SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF SHOOTING AT ROUTE 91

Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President,
I rise today to commemorate a terrible
tragedy. Today is a solemn day and a
chance to reflect. Two years ago, in my

people gathered on a warm evening at
the Route 91 music festival. They were
there with friends, partners, family.

They came to listen to country music,
relax, and just celebrate.
Two years ago on that evening, they
heard the pop of what sounded like
fireworks. After seconds for some, min-
utes for others, they understood what
was happening: an attack that would
become the worst mass shooting in
modern American history.
In the space of 11 minutes, Las Vegas
was transformed. In that narrow win-
dow of time, 58 people were mortally
wounded and hundreds of others were
injured, many of them grievously.
I still think about the stories of
those who ran into the crowd to help
others, those people who made a com-
mitment that night to our community
to protect others from harm. Police,
firefighters, and other first responders
who ran toward the festival grounds to
rescue others made that commitment
that October evening. The people who
piled the wounded into their cars, vans,
and pickups also offered a hand to help
strangers. So did the doctors and
nurses who rushed to the hospitals and
the hundreds of Las Vegas and Reno
residents who stood in line to donate
blood. They all felt viscerally the de-
sire to help those who were suffering in
whatever way they could.
We made a commitment to all those
caught up in the devastating attack at
the Route 91 festival, a promise that I
honor today. I vowed to do all I could
to help my community heal, to remem-
ber those who died, and to support
those who bear scars of the body or of
the spirit.
During that dark time 2 years ago,
my city came together to help and sus-
tain the wounded and their families—
people from all over the world, neigh-
bors and strangers alike. I have never
been prouder of Las Vegas.
So many different groups worked in
tandem that evening. There were the
brave actions of the Las Vegas Metro-
politan Police Department, the Clark
County School District Police Depart-
ment, the Las Vegas Fire Department,
and the Clark County Fire Depart-
ment, who unhesitatingly risked their
lives to stop the attack and rescue sur-
vivors.
Health institutions across the State
joined the effort, like American Med-
ical Response, Medic West Ambulance,
Community Ambulance, the University
Medical Center, Sunrise Hospital and
Medical Center, the Valley Health Sys-
tem, and Dignity Health. So many doc-
tors and nurses, including Nellis Air
Force Base medical professionals,
worked then and in the weeks and
months that followed to restore people
to health. The Red Cross and the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs supported
the hospitals with their mobile units.
There was the staff at United Blood
Services, who worked doggedly to proc-
ess donations from thousands of people
in Las Vegas, Reno, and elsewhere in
Nevada.
There were many people and organi-
zations in Nevada and nationwide that
provided food, blankets, reduced airline
tickets, and other ways to support the
victims and their families. The FBI and
the Nevada Victims of Crime Program
helped families struggling with funeral
and travel expenses. Airlines like Alle-
giant and Southwest also helped to
cover costs. Donations poured in from
Las Vegas and around the world. The
donations are still coming in to sup-
port the Children of the 58 Fund, which
Neysa Tonks’ family set up in remem-
brance of her to provide scholarships to
children of victims. Donations are
coming in to the Kern Community
Foundation Day of Remembrance
Fund, which also provides scholarships
to victims and survivors.
All of these people put aside their
own needs—sometimes for moments
and sometimes for months—to help
others. They made a commitment to
the victims. Part of that commitment
simply has to be working to prevent
other families in America from going
through what families went through on
that October 1 night as they waited in
the Family Reunification Center, cry-
ing out for information about their
loved ones but terrified at what they
would hear.
Here is the frightening part, the part
that keeps me and so many of us across
this Nation up at night: The shootings
haven’t stopped since October 1, 2017.
Unimaginably, people who survived the
Route 91 shooting have found them-
selves terrorized by gun violence again
since that tragic night. Some of them
were at the Borderline Bar and Grill in
Thousand Oaks, CA, just over a year
after October 1 when a gunman opened
fire and killed or wounded two dozen
people. Others were in Gilroy, CA, just
this July, where a man killed or
wounded over a dozen people at an an-
nual festival. Can you imagine going to
enjoy yourself one afternoon or
evening and having that place of com-
munity and celebration turn into a war
zone? And then having that happen not
once, in some horrible nightmare come
to life, but multiple times. We cannot
let this waking nightmare continue in
America.
We have to make a commitment to
each other, a promise that we will not
leave each other and those we love to
be victims of this senseless violence,
not when we can do something to stop
it.
Americans know this. They know
that we are needlessly endangering our
children and each other. They know
that commonsense gun reform could
both respect responsible gun ownership
and fight the public health crisis that
mass shootings and senseless gun vio-
lence represent.
That is why people in both parties
support gun violence reform by huge
margins. They know that we simply
cannot sidestep our responsibility to
each other. We have to reduce these
senseless mass shootings and save
lives, and we can do that while also re-
specting the rights of responsible gun
owners. We owe that to our commu-
nities.
The families of those wounded on 1
October haven’t given up on their re-
sponsibilities. They are still there for
their loved ones day after day, as the
visible and invisible wounds have con-
tinued to heal and as people have
learned to walk, talk, and work again.
The doctors and nurses who have
cared for the injured have not given up.
They don’t say: Well, it has been 2
years; so we will not care for patients
anymore.
We haven’t taken down the many
moving memorials to 1 October, like
the mural at the corner of Westcliff
and Antelope Way, the 58 wooden
crosses near the Las Vegas welcome
sign on the Strip, or the Community
Healing Garden on Casino Center Bou-
levard.
Just the opposite, Clark County Mu-
seum has been carefully photographing
and cataloging over 17,000 items, from
Las Vegas Strong T-shirts and bumper
stickers to stuffed animals, from artifi-
cial flowers to rosaries that people left
at memorials to the Route 91 victims
and survivors. That care and that at-
tention—that is what a commitment
is. When you make one, you have to be
there for the long haul, to see the thing
you promised to the end.
I will always remember the 1 October
victims and their loved ones and al-
ways commemorate their loss. I know
it is a loss that can never be fully re-
paired but only eased by time. I will al-
ways honor the bravery of those who
sacrificed their own safety to help oth-
ers, and I will never stop fighting to
make America safer, to save families
across the country from what I
watched families in Las Vegas go
through that night and from what my
own family went through as we waited
to hear back about whether my niece
was safe or not as she attended that
concert that night.
This is our commitment. We have to
continue to remember, but we have to
do something about it. Our time is
now.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada.
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, on Octo-
ber 1, 2017, the city of Las Vegas expe-
rienced a tragedy on an unprecedented
scale—a tragedy that has left our com-
munity deeply scarred and our city for-
ever changed.
It was a warm October night. Tens of
thousands of people were gathering in
town for a music festival. They were
there to have fun, to dance, and to be
joyous, but that joy was cut short by
violence and terror when a lone gun-
man began to open fire.
In the 10 minutes that the shooting
lasted, over 1,100 rounds were fired. I
repeat: 1,100 rounds. There were 58 in-
nocent people murdered and 422 in-
jured.
Next week marks the second anniver-
sary of that horrific evening—the dead-
liest mass shooting in American his-
tory. Sons, daughters, parents, friends,

and neighborhoods—each one of them
were loved, and they were all taken
from us far too soon.
Countless others were injured in the
chaotic frenzy that followed the gun-
fire. Many will never live the same life
they once knew.
Several victims from that night
never received the care they needed,
including members of the Nevada’s im-
migrant community, who were too
scared—too scared—to seek care for
risk of deportation.
The 1 October shooting forever al-
tered the lives of countless families in
Las Vegas and countless families
across this country. Many are still
grieving and will suffer through pain
that no family, no friend, no spouse, or
no child should ever have to face, and
that empty seat at every Thanksgiving
and every holiday table will never be
filled.
Numerous survivors are still working
through the effects of this incredible
trauma. Put simply, this massacre
shook our community to its very core.
Let me be clear when I tell you today
that we were not and we will not be
shattered. The bright lights of Las
Vegas will continue to shine through
the darkness of that day. We are resil-
ient, and we will always be Vegas
Strong.
I stand here today to honor the mem-
ory of 58 victims who lost their lives
and the hundreds more who were in-
jured and are still fighting to recover.
I am here to say that they will never
be forgotten. We will be there to stand
side by side with them as they con-
tinue to overcome the challenges and
trauma brought on by the shooting.
We must also remember that in the
face of terror, there were people who
made the selfless choice to run toward
the gunfire and to help. They were our
brave first responders who risked their
lives to offer aid. They were everyday
citizens who allowed others to escape
in their cars. They were law enforce-
ment officers, firefighters, physicians,
and cabdrivers. Every member of our
community that could came out to
help. All of them are heroes, and all of
them must be remembered.
Heroes continue to come forward in
the days, weeks, months, and even
years now following the shooting, lin-
ing up to donate blood, giving financial
aid to help support those who were in-
jured and the families of those who
were murdered, helping to reunite
friends and families in the aftermath,
and, to this day, providing counseling
and the much-needed support to those
who are still suffering from the trauma
of that horrific night.
Our city provided legal, financial,
and mental health services to those
who were affected by the violence that
night, including the formation of the
Vegas Strong Resiliency Center.
In the days immediately following
the shooting, community members and
local businesses formed what is now
known as the Las Vegas Community
Healing Garden, a memorial to those
whose lives were lost. Visitors planted
58 trees—one for each victim—and
painted rocks and ornaments with
words of encouragement and words of
strength. Family members decorated
trees of their loved ones.
Following the shooting, Nevada also
took action, passing a series of gun
safety measures to prevent this kind of
tragedy from occurring again.
Two years have passed. I wish I could
say that Congress has followed Ne-
vada’s lead, that we have come to-
gether as a nation in healing, put par-
tisanship aside, and passed common-
sense gun safety legislation to protect
the lives of Americans. But, sadly, this
is not the case.
Each day and each year that Con-
gress fails to pass commonsense gun vi-
olence prevention measures is another
day and another year that we fail to
honor the 58 who lost their lives on 1
October and the countless lives that
have been lost to gun violence.
This type of tragedy happens all too
often in our country. This past year,
there were 337 mass shootings. That is
nearly one a day for an entire year. So
far in 2019, we have already experienced
over 300 mass shootings. This is unac-
ceptable. We must work to prevent
these weapons from ending up in the
wrong hands, and we owe it to the
countless Americans who have lost
their lives, who were injured and for-
ever scarred, to find a solution, not
just for those who lost their lives in
Las Vegas but for those in countless
other American cities.
In the days following the terrible
tragedies in Gilroy, El Paso, and Day-
ton, I visited the heroes of the Vegas
Strong Resiliency Center. They have
been working nonstop for 2 years help-
ing our community to heal. As I
learned of their efforts not only to help
victims and survivors but also to ex-
tend a hand to help communities like
ours in their greatest time of need, I
was reminded by them of just how re-
silient we are as a people, as a commu-
nity, and as a country.
We owe it to these heroes to no
longer accept inaction. We must all
continue to stand up, to speak out, and
to refuse to allow these kinds of trage-
dies because they should never define
us.
No American—no American—should
ever have to think twice about going to
church, the movies, or a concert on a
warm October night, and no parent—no
mother—should have a bulletproof
backpack on their back-to-school shop-
ping list.
As Members of Congress, we were
elected to solve problems and to keep
our country safe. When it comes to gun
violence, we are failing. We are failing
spectacularly on both counts, but we
don’t have to. We can take action. We
can take reasonable steps to reduce
gun violence. We can put a stop to the
carnage that is happening across our
country, and we can do this while still
respecting the Second Amendment.
What is happening is not normal, but
it is also not inevitable. Sharing our
thoughts and prayers shouldn’t be the
only action we ever take. Let’s put our
differences aside and make mass shoot-
ings a thing of the past, not a daily ex-
pectation for our future.
It has been over 200 days since H.R. 8,
the Bipartisan Background Checks Act,
passed the House of Representatives. I
am a proud cosponsor of the Senate’s
companion legislation, S. 42. The legis-
lation is ready to go. The legislation
will close loopholes and require back-
ground checks for all commercial gun
sales, including those made at gun
shows and on the internet.
In memory of the 58 Americans who
lost their lives on 1 October and those
who have lost their lives before and
after, I call on my colleagues to act
and to take up this legislation for an
immediate vote.
It is past time. It is past time that
we come together and find solutions. It
is past time because if we don’t act,
then, the inevitable will continue to be
our daily reality.
We can prevent mass shootings in
this country, but ‘‘can’’ is not possible
without the word ‘‘courage.’’
I implore this body to have the cour-
age so that no other family has to en-
dure this kind of tragedy, this kind of
trauma, and this kind of sorrow.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 2486
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I am here
once again to urge the Senate to take
up the FUTURE Act, to extend funding
for our historically Black colleges and
universities.
I see my great friend, the Senator
from Tennessee, across the way, and I
know the Senator, as a music fan and a
musician himself, understands the
term ‘‘broken record.’’ A broken record
is that record that is an old album and
the vinyl has a little bit of a flaw, and
it just gets stuck on the same lyric,
the same refrain, and keeps going back
to it. That is what I feel like today.
I also know that with just a little
pressure on those old vinyl records,
just a little bit of pressure, you can go
right through that and get to melody.
That is what I was hoping to do today,
that we could put just enough pressure
on the Senate and others to go right
through and fund HBCUs. The deadline
for that funding ends September 30.
People will say it is not going to turn
the lights out in our historically Black
colleges and universities, and it is not.
I get that. We also know we have to
plan. We have to look months in ad-
vance. We have to look a year in ad-
vance to make sure that funding is
there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5719
September 26, 2019
This bill—a similar bill has passed
the House of Representatives unani-
mously. In this partisan world we are
living in, it passed the House unani-
mously the other day. It has over-
whelming bipartisan support in this
body.
This is something our historically
Black colleges and universities need
today. They don’t need to wait. We
don’t need to put them in the lurch and
uncertainty because in today’s world in
Washington, DC, there is no certainty.
We don’t know what will happen to-
morrow. We don’t know what is going
to happen next week with the legisla-
tion that will come before this body.
Nothing is predictable. We don’t see
the kind of legislation we should be
seeing. We don’t deliberate and have
the kind of deliberations we have seen
this body have in the past.
So to say we can put this together as
part of a bigger bill and hopefully get
this done this year is possible, but it is
also just as possible, in today’s world,
that doesn’t get done, that it ends up
somewhere buried beneath a whole
bunch of other qualified and just as
meritorious bills that never see the ac-
tion of the U.S. Senate or the Congress
of the United States.
I would urge—urge that we do the
right thing by our historically Black
colleges and universities. Let’s get this
bill passed unanimously and sent to
the President of the United States for
his signature so all of our historically
Black colleges and universities and mi-
nority-serving institutions can breathe
a sigh of relief.
I ask unanimous consent the Senate
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 212, H.R. 2486;
that the bill be considered read a third
time and passed; and that the motion
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table with no intervening
action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
an objection?
Mr. ALEXANDER. I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Tennessee is recog-
nized.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the
distinguished Senator from Alabama
mentioned music, and I guess a lot of
us have been watching Ken Burns’
‘‘Country Music’’ film the last several
days, which is terrific and includes lots
from Alabama and even more from
Tennessee.
My experience with music and Nash-
ville songwriters is, to get a melody,
you need some cooperation. You need
cooperation. Usually, they have three
songwriters who will write a song. I am
interested in harmony, but I think we
need some cooperation across the aisle
as on our committee—thanks to the
distinguished Senator from Wash-
ington State, Mrs. MURRAY, and Sen-
ator JONES—we often have. We had it
on fixing No Child Left Behind; we had
it on the 21st Century Cures; we had it
on the Opioid Crisis Response Act; we
had it on the Lowering Healthcare
Costs Act, which came out of our com-
mittee 20 to 3 just recently; and we
need to have it on higher education.
So I have a suggestion today. I want
to speak about it for about 10 minutes.
It would, I believe, give an opportunity
to deal with the historically Black col-
leges legislation and indeed an oppor-
tunity to do more than that.
In the first place, the bill passed by
the House is a short-term bill, which is
funded by a budget gimmick, which has
no chance of passing the Senate. I pro-
pose that we do permanent funding of
historically Black colleges. That is the
way to provide certainty. I propose
that we include within it a package of
seven or eight other pieces of legisla-
tion on which there is bipartisan sup-
port—as many as half the Members of
the Senate, about half Republican and
half Democratic. All of these provi-
sions—simplifying FAFSA, short-term
Pell grants, Pell grants for prisoners,
increasing the amount of Pell—help
low-income Americans go to college
and simplify the process for doing that.
So if it is urgently important, as I
believe it is, to properly fund histori-
cally Black colleges, I am ready to do
that, but I am also ready to continue
to work to pass a small package of bills
that will help many of the same people
the historically Black colleges legisla-
tion would help and then continue to
work with Senator MURRAY and with
other members of the committee on a
larger package of bills that would in-
clude issues that could be part of a
more comprehensive Higher Education
Reauthorization Act—issues such as
accountability, Federal-State partner-
ship, campus safety, and the like.
For the last 5 years, Senator MURRAY
and I have been working on a bipar-
tisan reauthorization of the Higher
Education Act. We have had about 30
hearings on all manner of issues, from
accountability, to campus safety, to
simplifying the student aid process. We
have yet to reach agreement on some
of those issues, but on several impor-
tant issues, as I mentioned, we have bi-
partisan proposals by members of our
committee and Senators who are not
on the committee that will make col-
lege more affordable for low-income
students and make college worth stu-
dents’ time and money.
I am committed to working with the
Senator from Washington State to de-
velop a larger, more comprehensive
bill, but right now, why should we pass
up an opportunity to enact a package
that includes several of the bipartisan
proposals that are the result of our 5
years of work, including permanent
funding for historically Black colleges
and universities?
At the end of the month, as the Sen-
ator from Alabama said, the law pro-
viding for funding for historically
Black colleges and universities and
other minority-serving institutions ex-
pires. Everyone wants to see that con-
tinue.
The House of Representatives passed
legislation, but instead of the short-
term patch that the House passed, we
should pass a long-term solution that
gives certainty to college presidents
and their students. Congress has time
to do this. It is true that the law ex-
pires at the end of this month, but the
money doesn’t. The U.S. Department of
Education has sent a letter assuring
Congress that there is enough funding
in the program to continue through the
next fiscal year. So there is a year for
us to work on permanent funding and
this small package of other bills on
which we have already spent 5 years.
That ought to be enough time even for
U.S. Senators.
We should reach a long-term solu-
tion. That is why today I am intro-
ducing a long-term solution to perma-
nently provide funding for minority-
serving institutions, including the six
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities in Tennessee. The solution would
be part of a package of 8 bipartisan
higher education bills drafted by 35
Senators—20 Democrats, 15 Repub-
licans—that will help many of the
same students who are helped by the
historically Black colleges act.
The package of bills will make it
easier for millions of students to re-
ceive a college education by simpli-
fying the Federal application for stu-
dent aid, providing Pell grants to pa-
role-eligible prisoners, allowing Pell
grants to be used for short-term pro-
grams, and increasing the maximum
Pell grant award.
Here are the eight provisions that I
believe should be included in the pack-
age.
First, permanent mandatory funding
of $255 million each year for histori-
cally Black colleges and universities
and other minority-serving institu-
tions.
Second, FAFSA simplification re-
duces the number of questions on the
student application for Federal aid
from 108 to between 17 and 30 questions
that Senator JONES and I have pro-
posed. This means that a quarter of a
million students will now be eligible
for Pell grants. In addition, 1.3 million
students will be eligible for the max-
imum Pell grant award.
There is no excuse for not passing the
FAFSA Simplification Act. Senator
BENNET and I, as well as Senators MUR-
RAY, JONES, and others, have been
working on this for years. Twenty mil-
lion American families have to fill out
these 108 questions every year that are
unnecessary for them to fill out, and
delay is unnecessary for us.
No. 3, Pell grants for prisoners allows
incarcerated individuals who are eligi-
ble for parole to use a Pell grant for
prison education programs. This is
something a number of Senators want
to do, including Senators SCHATZ, LEE,
and DURBIN.
No. 4, the short-term Pell is a pro-
posal that a large group of Senators,
including Senators PORTMAN, KAINE,
CARDIN, GILLIBRAND, HASSAN, KLO-
BUCHAR, STABENOW, BALDWIN, BROWN,
CAPITO, COONS, ERNST, JONES, MORAN,

S5720 September 26, 2019
SHAHEEN, SINEMA, SMITH, WICKER, and
BRAUN, support. This legislation has
been introduced to use Pell grants for
high-quality, short-term skills and job
training programs that lead to
credentialing and employment in high-
demand fields like healthcare and
cyber security.
No. 5, a proposal to simplify aid let-
ters. Sometimes students get a letter
that says they have received money,
but some students don’t understand
that some of it is a loan that has to be
paid back and some of it is a grant.
Senators GRASSLEY, SMITH, CASSIDY,
ERNST, HASSAN, JONES, KLOBUCHAR,
MANCHIN, and RUBIO have legislation
that would simplify and make that
clear.
No. 6 in the package increases the
maximum Pell grant award.
No. 7 is a bipartisan proposal that
both President Obama and President
Trump have supported, which is to en-
sure that students who opt to pay back
their loans under the income-driven re-
payment plan pay the full 10 percent of
their discretionary income as the law
intended.
Finally, No. 8 is a proposal by Sen-
ator MURRAY and me, along with Sen-
ators COLLINS, CORNYN, GARDNER, HAS-
SAN, KING, STABENOW, TILLIS, and
WHITEHOUSE, to allow students to an-
swer up to 22 questions on the current
FAFSA with one click by using the
data the government already has from
the IRS.
I can’t tell you how many times Ten-
nessean parents have said to me: Why
do I have to give the government the
same information twice in order for my
student to be able to go to college?
This would also reduce the burden-
some verification process.
The Senate has already passed this
legislation once. That provision is
within the jurisdiction of the Finance
Committee and will be included once
the package is ready for consideration
on the floor.
In addition, there are at least three
other bipartisan provisions that, with a
little more discussion and work, I be-
lieve should be included in this pack-
age. They have the support of 30 Sen-
ators from both sides of the aisle.
The College Transparency Act is the
first. It creates a student unit record
system to help students and families
compare how students perform in spe-
cific colleges and universities. Sen-
ators WARREN, CASSIDY, BALDWIN,
BROWN, CASEY, CORNYN, DUCKWORTH,
ERNST, GARDNER, GRAHAM, GRASSLEY,
HASSAN, HYDE-SMITH, JONES, KAINE,
KLOBUCHAR, MURPHY, PERDUE, ROB-
ERTS, ROMNEY, SCOTT, SINEMA, SMITH,
SULLIVAN, TILLIS, TOOMEY, WHITE-
HOUSE, and ALEXANDER all support this
provision. There is substantial bipar-
tisan support in both the Senate and
House for it. We will work to include it
as we move forward.
The Education of the Deaf Act sim-
ply reauthorizes Gallaudet University
in Washington, DC, and has a long his-
tory of bipartisan support.
The Educational Opportunity and
Success Act reauthorizes the TRIO
Program, which helps low-income,
first-generation, and other disadvan-
taged students enroll and succeed in a
college or university program and has
the support of Senators COLLINS, BALD-
WIN, CAPITO, and TESTER.
To continue funding for historically
Black colleges and universities and
other minority-serving institutions,
the House of Representatives took a
shortcut. They rushed a bill to the
floor that has serious problems.
First, it is not a bill that can pass
the Senate. My objection is not the
only objection. Second, it only funds
HBCUs and minority-serving institu-
tions for 2 years, setting up yet an-
other artificial cliff. Finally, it uses a
budget gimmick to pay for it, which is
one reason it won’t pass the Senate.
This presents Congress with an op-
portunity to do it right and to pass
other important legislation that we
have already agreed to—at least half of
us. It presents Congress with an oppor-
tunity to give certainty to HBCUs and
minority-serving institutions and
make it easier for millions to receive a
college education.
The package of eight bills I am pro-
posing—the eight bills I am intro-
ducing today and the three bills I hope
to include later—has been drafted by 48
Senators—25 Democrats and 23 Repub-
licans. Working together on a bipar-
tisan bill that can pass the Senate now
is the best strategy to give permanent
funding to HBCUs and other minority-
serving institutions, to simplify the
Federal application for student aid, to
provide Pell grants to parole-eligible
prisoners, to allow Pell grants to be
used for short-term programs, and to
increase the maximum Pell grant
award.
Senator MURRAY and I have discussed
as recently as yesterday her desire and
my agreement to try to work toward a
comprehensive higher education piece
of legislation. We have been working
on that for 5 years. We can continue to
work on the issues that still divide us.
In the meantime, I agree, it is urgent
to deal with historically Black col-
leges. It is also urgent to deal with 20
million families who fill out FAFSA
every year and to work on the other
issues I mentioned. We have agreed on
those. Let’s put it in a package, turn it
into law, and keep working on the
other issues.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let’s
stop playing games with critical fund-
ing for minority serving institutions or
MSIs.
Mandatory funding expires on Sep-
tember 30, just days from now.
If that funding isn’t reauthorized,
MSIs will collectively face a $255 mil-
lion annual shortfall.
That will impact these institutions’
academic programs, ability to provide
housing to students, renovate facili-
ties, and provide critical counseling
and other student supports.
In 2018, Illinois received $5.3 million
of this funding, which supported city
colleges in Chicago, Northeastern Illi-
nois University, Chicago State, the
University of Illinois, and other insti-
tutions around our State.
Recently, the House of Representa-
tives passed the FUTURE Act to reau-
thorize this funding.
Unfortunately, the passage of this bi-
partisan bill has been blocked in the
Senate.
This is a great example of what frus-
trates the American people so much
about Congress.
We have a bipartisan bill that passed
the House by voice vote and that main-
tains funding for institutions of higher
education that enroll 6 million stu-
dents, of which two of three are stu-
dents of color.
But it is being held up, and we are
unnecessarily creating a crisis.
Let’s stop the games.
Let’s show America that we can
come together.
Let’s pass the FUTURE Act now.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am
here today to advocate on behalf of
Maryland’s four Historically Black
Colleges and Universities that face a
funding cliff next week. Without the
immediate passage of the FUTURE
Act, Bowie State University, Coppin
State University, Morgan State Uni-
versity, and the University of Mary-
land Eastern Shore face a collective
$4.2 million funding shortfall when the
Higher Education Act’s authorization
for mandatory funding for these insti-
tutions lapses.
This clean, bipartisan, 2-year reau-
thorization gives us breathing room to
continue to negotiate the full reau-
thorization of the Higher Education
Act without holding these historically
underfunded institutions hostage. Our
HBCUs and minority serving institu-
tions know that they can count on this
mandatory funding each year to
strengthen their course offerings in in-
demand STEM programs, make infra-
structure improvements, and provide
academic counseling and student sup-
port services to first generation and
historically underrepresented students.
This potential lapse in the authoriza-
tion for mandatory funding is exacer-
bated by the inability of Congress to
provide a fiscal year 2020 budget on
time, leaving institutions in even more
of a financial planning crunch. Throw-
ing the budgets of these institutions
into chaos directly harms their ability
to serve their students and commu-
nities. If this mandatory authorization
were to lapse, schools could not count
on mandatory funds to backfill spend-
ing at a later date. Institutions would
have to make decisions about reducing
levels of academic services, delaying
needed infrastructure investments, or
make staffing decisions.
This is an unnecessary obstacle that
our HBCUs and MSIs do not need to
face. I urge this body to join with the
House of Representatives and pass the
FUTURE Act to ensure this mandatory
funding remains in place.
Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5721
September 26, 2019
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want
to thank my colleague from Alabama
for his tremendous leadership on this
very critical effort because right now
we are days away from a very dam-
aging lapse in funding for our HBCUs,
our Tribal colleges, and other minor-
ity-serving institutions that creates
unnecessary and needless uncertainty
for students in schools across this
country.
Both of my colleagues spoke of music
and the need for harmony. Well, it ap-
pears to me that the bill the Senator
from Alabama is asking us to approve
today for the funding for HBCUs is a
heck of a lot of harmony. The House
has already acted to fix this. They sent
this bill to the Senate on a bipartisan
basis. All Members of the House sup-
port it, and it is paid for in a way even
the White House supports. In this day
and age, I would take that harmony.
So I am very frustrated about today’s
opposition to this simple step to pro-
tect colleges and universities with such
important missions. I can’t see a good
reason why we haven’t sent the Presi-
dent this bill.
I listened to the Senator from Ten-
nessee, and it sounds to me like he
wants to write a whole new song. He is
interested in a small package of higher
education proposals, and he said he
wants to see the FUTURE Act as a part
of that. But it is pretty clear to me
that when you have a good song and
you have everybody together moving
that, and maybe there is a discordant
note somewhere, you just keep moving
forward with that song—if we want to
stay with the country music theme
here.
I believe we should not delay it. Let’s
move this forward. Let’s not threaten
the funding for some of our most val-
ued institutions. We should take this
up and pass the FUTURE Act right
away and then continue our committee
discussions about how to reauthorize
the Higher Education Act.
Since the start of those discussions, I
have been very clear that we need to do
this reauthorization in a comprehen-
sive way that really helps students
with the many challenges they face.
We have so many students today who
are struggling with the burdensome
costs of getting a degree, who find
themselves cheated by bad actors that,
by the way, Secretary DeVos is not
holding accountable, and they are
stuck with mounting debt. They face
bullying, harassment, and assault when
they should be focused on learning in
their classes, or they are faced without
pathways to help them get into higher
education in the first place.
Today the House is rightly looking at
a comprehensive higher education re-
authorization to address all these
issues of affordability, accountability,
campus safety, and acceptability, and
that is what the Senate should do as
well. Surely the Senate can reach an
agreement on those issues but only if
we stay at the table and keep working
together rather than veering off the
course we set. That is what I am very
concerned a smaller package would
mean.
I believe that we have a real oppor-
tunity to reach a comprehensive agree-
ment that helps students in need, and
we ought to take it. In the meantime,
there is no excuse for playing politics,
holding up the FUTURE Act, and ex-
posing students and schools nationwide
to uncertainty and to dysfunction.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I
rise today to join my colleagues, Sen-
ator MURRAY and Senator JONES, to
call upon the Senate to pass the Fos-
tering Undergraduate Talent by
Unlocking Resources for Education
Act—the FUTURE Act—today because
that future is today.
Should the Senate fail to act on this
legislation, hundreds of minority-serv-
ing institutions and historically Black
colleges and universities across Amer-
ica are going to face some drastic fund-
ing cuts that could jeopardize the edu-
cation of millions of students of color
nationwide. Collectively, these institu-
tions serve nearly 6 million under-
graduate students throughout the
United States, two-thirds of whom
come from communities of color.
Without these Federal dollars for
MSIs, we will be facing the potential
for job losses, the possible closure of
important academic programs, and
most importantly, the doors of edu-
cational opportunity slamming shut
for young men and women of color
across this country. Minority-serving
institutions have long enjoyed bipar-
tisan support in this body. It is per-
plexing and concerning to think that
the Senate would depart for recess
without passing this critical legisla-
tion.
In the coming years, these institu-
tions of higher learning will play an in-
creasingly vital role in our increas-
ingly diverse Nation. Consider that, al-
ready, Hispanic children make up one
out of every four children in America’s
public schools and counting. Of these
students, approximately one out of five
will go to college. And when they do,
two-thirds of them will wind up study-
ing at a Hispanic-serving institution.
Can we, as a nation, really afford to
shortchange their education?
In representing a community that is
already such a large part of the Amer-
ican population—one out of four is
going to be one out of three in just a
couple of years—can we afford to short-
change their education and, as such,
the success of this country, which de-
mands that we do not?
Just last Thursday, this body joined
me to unanimously pass my bipartisan
resolution honoring Hispanic-serving
institutions week. But it is hard to
take seriously our words of support for
minority-serving institutions if we fail
to back up those words with real ac-
tion. Unfortunately, that is where we
stand today—on the cusp of skipping
town without voting to properly fund
these institutions.
Across America, 523 Hispanic-serving
institutions in 25 States, the District
of Columbia, and Puerto Rico serve
more than 2 million hard-working
Latino and Latina students who dream
of a college education. I know this
dream well. Indeed, my own story
began at a Hispanic-serving institu-
tion, even though that designation did
not yet exist at the time. I was the
first in my family to attend college,
and I did so at St. Peter’s College in
Jersey City, NJ. It is because of the
professors and educators at St. Peter’s,
who recognized that not all children
arrive at college with the same advan-
tages or opportunities for upward mo-
bility, that I am here today—one of
four Hispanic-American Senators.
It is a story that is repeated not only
in Hispanic-serving institutions but at
HBCUs and other MSIs across the
country that help students from under-
served communities overcome the odds
and reach their true potential.
This isn’t a Democratic or Repub-
lican issue. The House passed this bill
by voice vote. It was such an easy vote
that they didn’t even require a rollcall.
I understand that there are many other
issues facing our higher education sys-
tem, and I appreciate that. I am com-
mitted to working with my col-
leagues—particularly Senators ALEX-
ANDER and MURRAY, the chairman and
ranking member of the HELP Com-
mittee—to help create a system in this
country that helps serve all of our stu-
dents and prepares America’s work-
force to compete all around the world.
Yet the fact is that these minority-
serving institutions face a funding cliff
if we fail to act.
Let’s not make our students of color
pay the price while we continue to de-
bate the broader issues facing our high-
er education system. Let’s pass the FU-
TURE Act today.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
FISCHER). The Senator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. I appreciate the
comments by the Senator from New
Jersey.
To be clear, the House bill for his-
torically Black minority-serving insti-
tutions creates a new funding cliff. It is
a short-term patch for 2 years that cre-
ates a cliff after 2 years. It is supported
by a budget gimmick that can’t pos-
sibly pass the Senate.
What I have proposed is a permanent
solution to get rid of the cliff—a per-
manent solution that those institu-
tions and those students can depend
on. The proposal is $255 million a year,
fully paid for. Second, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education has written a letter
to Congress and said that no one is
going to lose their money at the end of
the month. The law expires, but the
money doesn’t. There is enough money
to continue the program for another
year. It shouldn’t take us another year

to work this out. Third, it is urgent to
deal with historically Black colleges.
Let’s look at the students, not the
colleges. Who goes to historically
Black colleges? Low-income students
often go there. And every year, 20 mil-
lion low-income Americans fill out this
ridiculously complicated FAFSA appli-
cation for student aid that has 108
questions. We agree on both sides of
the aisle—and have for several years—
that it could be limited to 17 to 30
questions. The president of the South-
west Tennessee Community College in
Memphis, TN, which is almost all Afri-
can American in terms of its students,
tells me he loses 1,500 students a year,
almost all African American, who are
intimidated by this complicated
FAFSA.
Let’s do both of these things. Let’s
have a permanent solution for histori-
cally Black colleges, and let’s help the
20 million families who fill out this ri-
diculously complicated form every
year because we agree on that. There is
no need to wait on that. We have Re-
publicans and Democrats who agree on
it. We could finish this in a matter of
a few weeks. No one is going to lose
any money. There is enough money for
historically Black colleges for a year,
and there is no excuse for creating a
new cliff to replace the one that will
occur in a year.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky.
AMENDMENT NO. 942
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I call
up my amendment No. 942 and ask that
it be reported by number.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the Paul amendment
by number.
The bill clerk read as follows:
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. PAUL]
proposes an amendment numbered 942.
The amendment is as follows:
(Purpose: To reduce the amount
appropriated by 2 percent)
At the appropriate place in division A, add
the following:
SEC. lll. REDUCTION IN RATE FOR OPER-
ATIONS.
The rate for operations provided by section
101 is hereby reduced by 2 percent.
Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent
that I be allowed to complete my re-
marks before we begin the next vote.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. PAUL. My amendment to this
spending bill will be to cut 2 percent
across the board, so we can actually be
responsible and try to balance our
budget.
Most people I talk to at home or peo-
ple who come up here, who are seeking
assistance from the Federal Govern-
ment, say: That doesn’t sound too
bad—1 or 2 percent. We could deal with
that.
People come to me and say: Well, my
group is doing this great research for
this disease that affects all of these
people.
I say: How much are you getting?
They say: $100 million.
I say: We have a trillion-dollar debt,
and everybody ought to try to spend
what comes in rather than spending
money we don’t have. Does it make
sense even for a good cause to borrow
money from China to spend money we
don’t have?
Most of them—even groups that live
at the Federal trough, groups that need
and want and all they come here for is
Federal money—say: Well, that is not
too unreasonable. We got $100 million
last year.
Could you take $98 million for the
good of the country? Instead of getting
$100 million, could you take $98 mil-
lion—2 percent less—in order to bal-
ance the budget and not destroy the
country with all of this debt?
Interestingly, whether these groups
are from the left, right, center, Repub-
lican, Democrat, or Independent, most
of them look at me and nod their
heads. I think the groups that receive
Federal money realize this massive
debt we have is destroying the country.
Even the groups receiving it are willing
to cut 1 percent or 2 percent. But do
you know who is not? The Senate—the
Congress. They will not cut anything.
My amendment today to add a 2-per-
cent cut to this spending will get 15 or
20 votes. Not one Democrat will vote
for this bill. Do you know what the
Democrats will say? They will say: The
debt is because you cut taxes. This is
something that is factually incorrect.
We did cut taxes, but revenue is up.
This is a fact. We cut the tax rates, but
the economy is growing gangbusters,
and revenue is up.
Why do we have a massive debt? Why
are we breaking records? Why, in Feb-
ruary, did we have more debt added
than at any other time in our history?
Why are we about to bust a trillion dol-
lars in debts this year? It is spending;
it isn’t revenue. Revenue is up.
We did cut tax rates, and companies
are growing like they haven’t grown in
decades. If you talk to businesses, the
biggest problem in our country right
now is they can’t find enough people to
work for them. There is a labor short-
age in our country. It is a great time to
be a worker in our country.
But this will not pass. My amend-
ment will not pass because people are
afraid that the public will not like
them if they don’t give them more
money. I am afraid we will destroy the
country if we keep running more debts.
The debt is growing at 8 percent a
year. Spending is growing only at 4.5
percent, 5 percent a year. The debt is
growing more rapidly because we have
accumulated so much. We have over a
$22 trillion debt. The interest this year
is over $300 billion. As it grows faster
and faster, the interest will exceed
what we are spending on the military
within about 5 years. Nobody is doing
anything about it.
We passed spending caps 5 years ago.
It was called the sequester. It went on
for a while and actually was reducing
the debt. Then you ask whose fault is
it that we have this massive debt, this
massive spending; is it Republicans or
Democrats? The answer is yes. Both
parties are fiscally irresponsible, but it
has nothing to do with taxes or rev-
enue. Revenue is going up dramati-
cally. It has to do with spending. Both
parties are guilty of this.
The Republicans want unlimited
military spending, and the Democrats
want unlimited welfare spending. Peo-
ple say that there is not enough com-
promise in Washington. That is abso-
lutely untrue. It is absolutely
misreported by the media. There is too
much compromise here. The com-
promise is always to spend more money
and to spend money we don’t have. The
military gets their unlimited money,
and the welfare state gets unlimited
spending. Republicans and Democrats
both join hands together, and what
happens around here on a day-to-day
basis is compromise to spend money we
don’t have, to borrow it from China
and, sometimes, to send it back to
China.
Do you realize we send economic de-
velopment aid to China? That is ridicu-
lous. We send money all around the
world. Many of these countries that get
money don’t like us. They hate us.
They burn our flag in the street, yet we
send them money. We are not even
sending our own money. We borrow
from China to send it out.
I think this is a very reasonable pro-
posal. Some will say it is draconian. If
they passed my amendment today and
cut spending by 2 percent, we would
still be spending more money than 2
years ago. We would be spending $19
billion more than 2 years ago. If we
pass my 2 percent cut—the 2-penny cut
that I am proposing—we would still be
spending more money than the caps
that the vast Senate majority voted on
5 years ago.
Why is the debt burgeoning? Whose
fault is it? Is it Republicans; is it
Democrats? The answer is yes. Both
parties are acting fiscally irrespon-
sibly. It has nothing to do with tax rev-
enue and has everything to do with
spending. People say that the people
want it. Do the people want a bankrupt
country? Do they want a country that
is being eaten from the inside out? Do
they want this reckless spending that
someday will lead to a day of reck-
oning? No.
I think we have to get our house in
order and get our budget in order. I
think we need to balance our budget. If
my amendment for a 2-percent cut
were to pass—how many families have
had to deal with 2 percent less? How
many businesses in bad times have to
cut their budget by 2 percent? If the
government were today to pass my
amendment—a 2-percent cut—that
means you get 98 percent of everything
they are spending. We would balance
the budget within 5 years. That is os-
tensibly what many Republicans say
they are for.
When we have a vote for a balanced
budget, everybody lines up, and all of

the Republicans vote for a balanced
budget amendment to the Constitution
that says the budget will balance with-
in 5 years. Then, when given the oppor-
tunity to vote for spending cuts, we
lose half of the Republicans. The
Democrats don’t care, as they will not
vote for spending cuts, but the Repub-
licans at least profess to be for spend-
ing cuts. Yet, when we offer a modest
proposal like this, we lose half of the
Republicans.
There is a problem with debts, and
both parties share some guilt. What I
have put forward today, though, is an
opportunity for the Senators who truly
believe the debt is a problem to try to
restrain spending with a 2-percent cut
across the board. I hope Senators will
consider voting for this amendment.
I yield back the balance of my time.

TRIBUTE TO SHEA WOODARD HALL
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today
to give tribute to a great American, a
great Texan, a dear friend, and a 26-
year veteran of this institution who
has dedicated her career to serving the
needs of her fellow citizens. Her name
is Shea Woodard Hall. Shea has worked
as the West Texas regional director on
my team for 7 years. She is now retir-
ing. Shea started working in the Sen-
ate in 1993, when she was hired by my
predecessor, Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchinson.
As West Texas regional director,
Shea started with 89 counties in her re-
gion. By land area, that is bigger than
some States. She could leave her office
in Abilene, drive 7 hours north, and
still be in her region. That is how much
territory she was responsible for.
Shea has always been willing to go
the extra mile, literally. In her first 3
years working in the Senate, Shea put
75,000 miles on her car. In fact, she has
put so many miles on her vehicles
throughout the last 26 years that it is
probably for the best that she married
a local car dealer in Abilene.
After 26 years serving 89 counties in
West Texas, everyone knows Shea, and
Shea knows everyone. From every
mayor, to every county judge and sher-
iff, to every State elected official, Shea
made it a point to know them all. In
fact, when I traveled with Shea in West
Texas, we would arrive at an event, and
there was no doubt who folks were
happy to see—me or Shea, and it sure
wasn’t me.
Shea is also known in West Texas for
her rural tours. They are legendary.
You see, Shea’s region is diverse. It
spans from Amarillo, to Lubbock, to
Abilene, to San Angelo, to Big Spring,
to Midland-Odessa.
On the last tour she planned, an ag
tour, we started in Lubbock, with stops
in Muleshoe, Fredonia, Dalhart, and
Amarillo. If you know Texas, that is
one heck of a big loop. On one of the
stops, I asked Shea what we would be
seeing that day, and she answered:
‘‘Strippers.’’ I was fairly puzzled with

that response, and she quickly clari-
fied: ‘‘Cotton strippers.’’ I was relieved.
There are too many stories of Shea
helping people in West Texas, but one
of my favorite stories is about how
Shea helped to bring the B–1 bomber to
Texas. When the city of Abilene and
Dyess Air Force Base were working to
secure low-level training routes for the
B–1 bomber, Shea received some ques-
tions and some concerns from local
ranchers who were afraid that the
noise would upset their cattle. Always
the steady hand, Shea responded with
some West Texas wisdom. She would
tell them that the low-level training
routes were good for our national secu-
rity; that they would enhance Dyess
Air Force Base as the premier B–1 base
in the country; and finally, she would
tell them that she hadn’t received a
single phone call from a cow protesting
the noise. I am proud to say that be-
cause of her efforts and many others,
those training routes remain, and
today Texas is one of the homes of the
B–1 bomber.
Shea has become a living legend in
West Texas because no problem is too
big and no problem is too small. She
wants to help anyone and everyone
who calls her with an issue. She often
helps people in stressful situations,
navigating the leviathan of Big Gov-
ernment on behalf of fellow Texans in
their time of need. Shea also doesn’t
take no for an answer. If she didn’t get
the answer she needed to help a fellow
Texan, she didn’t give up.
She has been a tireless and effective
member of our team. That is her leg-
acy, and I know it will endure.
Shea is retiring next month. While
we will miss her greatly, she will re-
main a friend, and she will remain fam-
ily. We wish her well as she begins her
well-earned retirement. The Senate,
the people of Texas, and the thousands
of people and families whom she has
helped over the course of 26 years of
service will miss her too.
Thank you, Shea, for your work,
your determination, your passion, your
patriotism, and your love for Texas.
Texas says thank you.
God bless you.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NOMINATION OF EUGENE SCALIA
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want
to speak on the nomination, which will
occur before the Senate shortly, of Eu-
gene Scalia as Secretary of Labor.
I think it is important to say that as
President Trump continues relentlessly
pursuing his anti-worker agenda, now,
more than ever, we need a Secretary of
Labor who will stand up to the Presi-
dent and stand with working families,
not someone like Scalia, who is an
elite corporate lawyer, who has made
his career fighting for the biggest cor-
porations and against workers. We
need someone who will fight for strong
health and safety protections, not
someone who has crusaded to strike
them down. We need someone who will
hold companies accountable, not some-
one who used his last position in the
Department of Labor to undermine
whistleblower protections and fought
to get his corporate clients off the
hook for workplace harassment and
discrimination against workers with
disabilities.
We need someone who will fight for
workers’ economic security, not some-
one who helped companies get away
with stealing their workers’ wages and
denying overtime pay. We don’t need
someone who avoids committing to
support our efforts to raise the min-
imum wage to $15 an hour and close the
pay gap and, certainly, not someone
who costs working families billions of
dollars by fighting to strike down a
crucial rule that made sure they could
get retirement advice that was in their
best interest.
We need a Secretary of Labor, not a
secretary of corporate interests. Yet at
our confirmation hearing last week,
Scalia made very clear that is exactly
what he would be by dodging taking a
stand for workers and deferring to
President Trump’s anti-worker agenda.
I have been deeply concerned about
his awful record since day one. I
strongly oppose his nomination. I urge
my colleagues to do the same. Every-
one needs to take a long, hard look at
who Mr. Scalia fights for and who he
does not and think carefully about the
message their vote will send to work-
ing families in our country.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I guess I
shouldn’t be surprised. I have seen 21⁄2
years of a betrayal of American work-
ers from this White House, this govern-
ment, this Senate, and the President of
the United States. The White House
looks like a retreat for Wall Street ex-
ecutives, except on the days it looks
like a retreat for insurance executives,
except for the days it looks like a re-
treat for drug company executives.
I guess I shouldn’t be surprised, but a
few weeks ago, when we saw the nomi-
nation of Eugene Scalia to be Sec-
retary of Labor, it just underscored
again the betrayal of American work-
ers by this government and by this
President.
Eugene Scalia is the President’s
nominee to serve as Secretary of
Labor. His job as Secretary of Labor is
to represent workers, to advocate for
workers, and to fight for workers—not
to advocate for corporations, not to
sell out to special interests, but to side
with American workers. Yet all you
have to do is look at his job. The Presi-
dent has sent us a corporate lawyer
who has fought over and over to stop
workplace protections, to undermine
worker safety, and to cut and depress
workers’ wages over and over again.
Mr. Scalia, as an elitist, multi-
million-dollar corporate lawyer, has re-
peatedly defended companies against
whistleblowers. He defended Walmart
against its workers. And he is nomi-
nated to be Secretary of Labor?
He defended a corporation against 30
women who had been sexually harassed
at assembly plants. And he is going to
be the Secretary of Labor?
He defended other corporations
against workers with disabilities after
the companies violated the Americans
with Disabilities Act. And he is going
to be Secretary of Labor?
Over and over, he fought to help the
most powerful corporations against
workers, asking the courts to put their
thumb on the scales of justice, to
choose corporations over workers, to
choose Wall Street over consumers,
and to choose health insurance compa-
nies over patients. He has always come
down on the side of corporate interests,
of special interests, and in the end, al-
ways betrayed workers. And he is the
President’s nominee to be Secretary of
Labor?
He has defended union-busting cor-
porations. Boeing has been rabid in its
anti-union coercion. Scalia worked for
them, advocated for them in their
never-ending quest to stop workers
from having a voice in their company.
And he is going to be the President’s
Secretary of Labor?
What Mr. Scalia doesn’t understand
and what President Trump doesn’t un-
derstand is that you can’t say—let me
back up for a second. The President
loves to say that he supports this, that
he is for workers, that workers are his
friends, and that he is a friend to work-
ers. He loves saying that, but what he
doesn’t understand is that you can’t
support workers individually without
supporting workers collectively. You
can’t support workers individually
without supporting workers collec-
tively. You can’t support workers if
you attack unions.
We know what unions have brought
to this country. Ever since the gen-
erally rapid decline of trade unionism,
we have seen wages flatten, we have
seen benefits cut, and we have seen re-
tirements taken away from workers.
You know, when people can organize
and bargain collectively, they have
higher wages, they have better
healthcare, and they have a retirement
system.
You can’t support workers if you at-
tack unions like Mr. Scalia has done.
We need a Secretary of Labor who will
actually fight for labor. It is not called
the secretary of corporate interests or
the secretary of special interests; it is
called the Secretary of Labor. You are
supposed to honor work and respect
work. We need a Secretary of Labor
who will fight for labor, not fight for
corporate interests.
It comes down to whose side you are
on. Are you on the corporations’ side,
or are you on American workers’ side?
Do you fight for Wall Street wealth, or
do you fight for the dignity of work?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5725
September 26, 2019
The President promised to fight for
American workers. If you love your
country, you fight for workers. In-
stead, this President has betrayed
them over and over again. The nomina-
tion of Eugene Scalia to be Secretary
of Labor is the biggest betrayal of
them all.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
NOMINATION OF GENERAL JOHN E. HYTEN
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Gen.
John Hyten is before the Senate today
to be confirmed. We are anxious to get
to this. It has been a long time in the
working. It is going to happen, and I
am very thankful, not just for the sake
of General Hyten but for other officers
and junior officers who are looking at a
future, knowing some of the problems
that exist out there.
I have stood in this very spot and
talked about exactly what our Nation
is dealing with when it comes to our
national security. The world is more
dangerous now than it has ever been in
my lifetime. China and Russia are
building their capabilities as we have
fallen behind.
Our national defense strategy lays it
all out. We have a document that we
use. This is our blueprint. It is one that
was put together by Democrats and Re-
publicans some time ago, and we have
adhered to it. As chairman of the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee, I have
adhered to it and will continue to do
that.
As the Department of Defense and
the administration implement the na-
tional defense strategy and the rec-
ommendations of the NDS Commission,
we need confirmed leadership at the
Joint Chiefs to provide the military
perspective. We need strong, innova-
tive leadership, someone who under-
stands strategy, competition, new
warfighting domains like space, and
the importance of a strong nuclear de-
terrent. We need strategic guidance
born from years of firsthand experi-
ence.
To me, there is no doubt that Gen-
eral Hyten is the right man for the sec-
ond highest ranking military office.
Throughout his service, General Hyten
has developed a reputation of dis-
cipline, integrity, and honor. For the
past 21⁄2 years, he has led STRATCOM,
where he has demonstrated shrewd and
decisive understanding of our national
security objectives.
Before that, he served honorably in
top leadership positions at Air Force
Space Command. He has willingly and
selflessly served this Nation in uniform
for nearly four decades. I am confident
he is going to keep us on a path to re-
build our military advantage and pro-
tect our civilian military relations in
all this.
The Senate considered his nomina-
tion yesterday on a 20-to-7 vote to ad-
vance General Hyten’s nomination, and
here we are today making this final de-
cision. This came after a fair, exhaus-
tive, bipartisan process, where we
closely reviewed his nomination, in-
cluding allegations against him. The
Air Force Office of Special Investiga-
tions ran a tight and thorough inves-
tigation.
Now, in all my years I have been
here, I have never seen one of those
more exhaustive than this one. It went
on and on and on, and all the members
of the committee were able to read
every document that is out there. I am
very proud of the committee for taking
the deliberate time to make this hap-
pen. The committee held five executive
sessions, studied thousands of pages of
investigative records, and reviewed
statements from more than 50 wit-
nesses. Every member had the oppor-
tunity to ask questions and to read all
the documents. We did it.
The Armed Services Committee made
available all the information to make
sure there was nothing that was over-
looked. The Armed Services Com-
mittee takes allegations of sexual as-
sault very seriously, and it has for
many years. It is a problem. It is a
problem we are addressing on a regular
basis. We are on it, and we are going to
resolve it.
We went through a period of time in
the last administration when the mili-
tary was taken down in a manner that
has never happened before. It was un-
precedented. We actually went, in the
last 5 years of the Obama administra-
tion, to cutting the military by 25 per-
cent. It has never happened before.
Now we are going through a rebuilding
process. I applaud this President for all
he is doing in rebuilding our military.
I am proud of him, and that is where
we are right now.
Through the NDAA and stringent
oversight of the Department’s efforts
to this end, we are putting a stop to
any kind of misconduct that we have
been talking about. We can’t stop a
nomination from going forward on
unproven allegations, especially ones
we examined with the utmost of care
and closest scrutiny and determined
not to have merit.
So we are about to do this—about to
get this position confirmed. It is over-
due. I urge my colleagues to support
this nomination.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time
has expired.
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Hyten nomina-

GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, the

project.
I happen to sit on that committee led
by ROB PORTMAN. He has done a phe-
nomenal job of trying to pull all the in-
formation together to study govern-
ment shutdowns.
Government shutdowns are not new
to us. We hear about them a lot lately,
but in the last 40 years, we have had 21
government shutdowns—21.
We have seen this issue over and over
again; that when we get to a point of
contention and argument, we end up
shutting the government down to be
able to resolve it.
So the point of discussion is not just
here in DC; it is all over the country.
The question is, How does that really
affect the country and how does that
affect the U.S. Government?
The basic study PSI did to go back
and look at this was they found that
the Federal workforce in the last shut-
down lost 57,000 years of productivity,
if you spread out all the Federal work-
ers who were furloughed, the time they
were furloughed, and the time that was
lost.
The total economy lost about $11 bil-
lion in productivity during that time
period, and the Federal taxpayer lost
right at $4 billion in lost money that is
just gone. The cost of shutting the gov-
ernment down, the cost of reopening,
the cost of pay during the furlough
time periods when there weren’t actu-
ally people there—$4 billion lost to the
taxpayer.
Yet we will probably have another
one at some point and probably have
another one, and it seems they just
keep coming—21 of these in the last 40
years.
There is a group of us who have con-
tinued to push this. ROB PORTMAN has
done it for years, several others of us
have worked on other projects to try to
figure out how do we resolve this issue
of government shutdowns.
MAGGIE HASSAN, a Democratic col-
league from New Hampshire, and I a
year ago started talking through how
we could get to a bipartisan solution to
end government shutdowns.
We have a very unique proposal to go
with this. It is a proposal that is not
trying to be novel; it is not trying to
be cute. It is trying to solve the prob-
lem.
Our issue is that we have very serious
differences when we get to budget
areas. It is $1 trillion in total spending
that we are talking about when we do
the 12 appropriations bills. It is no
small argument. But we should be able
to resolve these things in a way that
actually works and is effective.
So here is our basic idea. The process
works, supposedly, where you do a
budget that determines an overarching
number that everyone agrees to. This
is what is called the top-line number.
Then you take that top-line number
in the House and the Senate in their
Appropriations Committees. It gets
broken up into 12 smaller bills. Those
are called the appropriations bills.
Those 12 bills all have to be passed by
the House, by the Senate, and then
they have to conference them together
and get that finished by the end of the
fiscal year.
It sounds like a good theory. That
was the plan, at least, that was made
in 1974, when this was designed. But the
plan that I just laid out has worked
only four times since 1974. So if you
think every year that the budget proc-
ess didn’t work again, you are correct.
It didn’t work again. It has worked
only four times since 1974.
What MAGGIE HASSAN and I would
like to insert into this process is the
ability to have serious, hard debate on
difficult financial issues where we have
disagreements but contain the fight to
Washington, DC, to do two things:
Make sure that we get to the appro-
priations process, that it is done well,
and to hold the Federal workers and
Federal families and the rest of the
country harmless as we argue through
this.
Here is the simple idea: If we get to
the end of the fiscal year, if we do not
have any 1 of those 12 appropriations
bills done—and we should have all 12 of
them done. But if even one is undone
when we get to the end of the fiscal
year, there is a continuation of spend-
ing exactly as it was the year before. It
just continues to run the same as it
was the year before so that Federal
agencies, Federal workers will con-
tinue to operate as they normally do.
But because there is not an appropria-
tions bill done for the next year, while
Federal workers are being held harm-
less and agencies are being held harm-
less, Members of Congress and our
staffs and the Office of Management
and Budget of the White House would
lose all travel ability. We would have
no official travel ability at all. We
couldn’t go home and see our families,
couldn’t travel on codels, couldn’t do
other responsibilities. We would be
here in Washington and be in session in
the House and the Senate every day of
the week, weekdays and weekends in-
cluded.
It is literally the equivalent of when
my brother and I would get into an ar-
gument when we were kids, which
clearly didn’t happen often. But when
it did happen, my mom would say to
my brother and me: The two of you go
into one of your rooms. Work this out.
When you get it worked out, you can
come out.
That would basically put Wash-
ington, DC, inside the box. The rest of
the country is not in it, but Wash-
ington, DC, would have to stay here,
and we would have to work out our dif-
ferences. When it is worked out, then
we pass appropriations bills.
The other feature that is added to it
is that we can’t move on to other
things. We couldn’t get distracted and
say that we are just not going to do ap-
propriations bills and then just stay
here and do other things. We would
have to do appropriations bills during
that time period.
This is a simple idea, though most
people I have talked to have said: That
is too simple. That would never work.
As I have talked to my colleagues in
the House and the Senate, just about
all of them have cringed when I have
said that we are going to be here week-
days and weekends and keep going on
one topic until we finish that one
topic.
It is our constitutional responsibility
to take care of the American people’s
tax dollars and to make sure it is done
correctly. We can move on to other
things when we fulfill our constitu-
tional responsibility on that. Just
about everyone I have talked to has
said: That is an idea that I could vote
for, that I can support.
I bring it up to this body to tell peo-
ple that we are still negotiating the
final language of this bill. If there is an
idea that people have to say ‘‘I have
one thing to ask about it,’’ bring it. If
you have one thing to suggest to
change it, bring it. But in the next few

weeks, before we get to the November
21 deadline, which is the new deadline
now for spending—before we get to that
spot, I want this issue resolved. I want
government shutdowns off the table. I
never want to see on any of the news
channels ever again the countdown
clock to when the government shuts
down. That hurts the American people;
it hurts American companies; and it
certainly hurts the Federal families
who go on furlough during that time
period.

25TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICORPS
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this fall
we celebrate the 25th anniversary of
AmeriCorps. Since President Kennedy
challenged Americans to serve our Na-
tion abroad in the Peace Corps in his
famous University of Michigan speech,
generations of Americans have recog-
nized that our greatest strength as a
nation is our compassion. But it wasn’t
until AmeriCorps was founded about 30
years later, 1994, that we truly ad-
dressed the need for service here at
home.
When I think about the work
AmeriCorps members do, I think about
the words of a speaker at a Martin Lu-
ther King breakfast in my home city of
Cleveland on a cold January morning,
and the speaker said: Your life expect-
ancy is connected to your ZIP Code.
Think about that. Your life expect-
ancy is connected to your ZIP Code.
Whether you grow up in Appalachia or
Ohio, Indiana, whether you grow up in
a city, an inner-ring city suburb, a
small city like I did in Mansfield, or a
small town, your ZIP Code often deter-
mines whether you have access to qual-
ity healthcare or good education and
the social support necessary to suc-
ceed. Whether it is through City Year
or Senior Corps or VISTA—all parts of
AmeriCorps—America works to fight
that and ensure that so many Ameri-
cans, regardless of their ZIP Code, have
the opportunity not only to succeed
but to thrive.
I have seen firsthand what a dif-
ference AmeriCorps makes in people’s
lives. My two daughters had amazing,
life-changing experiences, teaching for
a year through City Year. We all ben-
efit when we invest in organizations
that serve communities that are too
often left behind and when these orga-
nizations are staffed by young Ameri-
cans who care about those they serve.
In Ohio, we have a City Year in
Cleveland and Columbus. I have met
many of these City Year volunteers
and see the work they do.
AmeriCorps in my State played a
major difference in the Summer Feed-
ing Program. Literally tens and tens of
thousands of children are able to eat
well in the summer because of the
work that AmeriCorps does.
Since 1994, more than a million
Americans have served in communities
across the country, serving tens of mil-
lions of Americans. All of their work
will have a lasting impact on children
and families, and I can’t wait to see
what these good AmeriCorps members
will do over the next quarter century.
TRIBUTE TO JENNY DONOHUE
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise
today not very happily, if I can say, as
my employee and my friend Jenny
Donahue is leaving our office to take a
really big job in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, especially at a chal-
lenging, difficult time, and she will
serve there, I assume, every bit as well
as she served in the U.S. Senate.
Jenny is a middle-class kid who grew
up in small town Idaho. I have not
hired a lot of people in my office from
Idaho, but if the next person from
Idaho is this good, that will be a great
thing. She graduated from the Univer-
sity of Montana. Moving east, she went
on to become a leader in the U.S. Sen-
ate. She is a leader among communica-
tions directors. She is a leader in my
office, and she is a leader in this entire
body. She has left an indelible mark.
Part of being a good leader is being a
good mentor. She nurtures young tal-
ent. She brings out the best in the peo-
ple she works with.
My wife, Connie Schultz, who is one
of Jenny’s greatest admirers—and
there are many great admirers of
Jenny—loves to say that she is one of
the most fierce advocates for young
women she has ever met in her life. She
also says, oftentimes, that Jenny car-
ries as she climbs. As she moves up in
life and moves up into a new position,
you can bet that so many people are
going to benefit from her leadership
and her mentorship.
She has earned my wife’s respect.
That speaks such volumes about our
friend Jenny. She has earned the re-
spect of many Ohio reporters. She un-
derstands how important their work is
to Ohio communities and to our democ-
racy.
She respects journalism, under-
standing that journalism is about com-
forting the afflicted and afflicting the
comfortable. She knows that without
journalism—good journalism—you
can’t have good democracy.
She has been with me through some
of the biggest moments over the past 4
years as a friend, as an adviser, and
challenging me sometimes and telling
me when I am wrong oftentimes but al-
ways being there in the right ways.
She has been part of the dignity of
work rollout. She was part of our trip
to the border to bear witness to the hu-
manitarian crisis in part caused by the
President of the United States. She
was part of the historic 2016 Demo-
cratic National Convention.
She helped put my vision of dignity
of work on the road earlier this year,
including a trip to Selma, AL. Jenny
has such courage of her convictions.
She is not afraid to tell me when I am
wrong. She is not afraid to challenge
others, always coming from a place of
integrity and honesty—always.
She never does anything halfway.
When she says she will do something,
when she sets her mind to doing some-
thing, she does it, and she does it fully.
She does it well. She does it better
than pretty much anyone else could.
The day after the 2016 election, my
staff was pretty stunned that a human
being like Donald Trump would be in
the White House; that someone with
his lack of character, with his inability
to tell the truth, with his treatment of
women, would be President of the
United States. We were all pretty
stunned.
I gathered the staff in my office and
told them our jobs would become that
much more important. Jenny took on
this charge. Jenny, who was already
good before the 2016 election, took on
this charge of how our work mattered,
how I was one of the only selected offi-
cials in Ohio who would challenge the
President’s dishonesty, who would
challenge the President’s illegal behav-
ior, and who would challenge the Presi-
dent’s mean-spiritedness at the border,
on the overtime rule, cutting food
stamps—all the things this billionaire
has done. Jenny knew how important
that was. She took on this charge with
a sense of responsibility and a purpose
that made me proud, just like I know
her parents and her grandparents are.
As she moves on to her next job in
the House of Representatives, a leader
in the House, as she has been in the
Senate, she moves on to continue fight-
ing for justice and the dignity of work
in her new role.
Jenny, Godspeed.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk

JAMES MATTIS, AND GENERAL JOSEPH DUNFORD
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, this
afternoon I would like to honor and
recognize the important service of
three men, three Marine generals who
have served their country in uniform
and who have served their country in
the civilian world as well, who have
served with honor and dignity in ways
that I think deserve recognition on the
floor of the U.S. Senate. They have
done this service in a manner that is
befitting of marines, with dignity,
class, and honor. I am talking about

former Secretary of Defense Jim
Mattis, former Secretary of Homeland
Security and the President’s Chief of
Staff at the White House, Gen. John
Kelly, and, lastly, I would like to rec-
ognize Gen. Joe Dunford, who, on Mon-
day, will be stepping down as the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
I intend to be there to honor him and
to witness another remarkable transi-
tion of authority and power when U.S.
Army General Milley takes over in
what is the most important position
for a military officer in the United
States of America.
It will be the end of an era, a remark-
able era, for the Marine Corps—the
smallest of the military services,
where these three Marine generals—
Kelly, Mattis, and Dunford—served
with distinction, not only in the Corps
as four star generals but at the highest
levels of government at a critical time
in our country’s history.
It is a remarkable story. It is a story
of service, sacrifice, and friendship.
These extraordinary men rose through
the levels of command together and the
ranks of the Marine Corps together.
They served together all over the
world, including in combat in places
like Fallujah, Al Kut, and Baghdad.
They fought together, and they sac-
rificed together for our great Nation as
Marine Corps officers. They then went
on to serve in other ways.
The three of them have spent their
whole lives in service to our country,
and they have left an indelible mark,
certainly, on the Marine Corps but, I
believe, other institutions.
Between the three of them, they have
130 years of Active-Duty military serv-
ice to America—130 years. Think about
that: 130 years of Active military serv-
ice to the United States of America
and the Marine Corps.
They have given their all for us in a
way that I think makes most Ameri-
cans proud, emphasizing the ethos of
the Marine Corps, which is honor, cour-
age, and commitment, and I know they
have inspired countless numbers of
young men and young women across
the globe in the Marines and beyond.
I am going to talk a little bit about
them today.
Gen. John Kelly is a straight-talking,
blunt, and fierce warrior. Before he was
16, he hitchhiked to the west coast and
rode the rails back. He is then said to
have joined the Merchant Marine for a
year, where he is quoted as saying:
‘‘My first time overseas was taking
10,000 tons of beer to Vietnam.’’
In 1970, he enlisted in the Marines,
where he found purpose and found a
home.
Gen. Jim Mattis is a warrior, scholar,
appreciator of mavericks, known for
the reading lists he expects his marines
to follow, who as a teenager was ‘‘a me-
diocre student with a partying atti-
tude’’—an attitude that landed him in
jail a few times. But learning called,
and then the marines called, teaching
him and others how to ‘‘think like men
of action, and to act like men of
thought.’’ He is a legend in the Marine
Corps. His motto in Iraq, when he led
the forces there, was: ‘‘No Better
Friend, No Worse Enemy than a U.S.
Marine.’’ He is the first and only ma-
rine to ever be Secretary of Defense.
Then there is the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs, Gen. Joe Dunford, who
has had the Marine Corps flowing
through his veins his whole life. His fa-
ther served as a marine in Korea, and
three of his uncles were marines in
World War II. General Dunford had no
doubt that he would continue that tra-
dition.
While earning a degree from Saint
Michael’s College in Vermont, he was
commissioned as a second lieutenant.
During his career, from infantry com-
mander to Commandant of the Marine
Corps and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, he has been known for inspir-
ing respect in combat and on the field
of battle and in the corridors of Wash-
ington.
I had a brief opportunity to meet
General Dunford a few times as a ma-
rine when I was in Afghanistan and he
was the ISAF commander. The respect
that not only marines and American
servicemembers but all the allied
forces there had for him was very, very
apparent.
All three, as I mentioned, served in
Iraq. In 2003, General Kelly was pro-
moted to brigadier general and was the
first known promotion of a Marine
Corps colonel to brigadier general in an
active combat zone since Chesty Puller
in January of 1951. General Dunford,
serving under General Mattis during
the invasion, earned his own nickname
of ‘‘Fighting Joe,’’ which continued to
serve him well in Washington.
So as you just saw from my col-
league, the Senator from Ohio—there
has been much talk today on the floor
of the Senate from both sides of the
aisle about character, integrity, patri-
otism, or, unfortunately, the lack
thereof in Washington, DC, in the
House and the Senate, throwing bombs
at each other. But I think sometimes it
is important to come down and talk
about the other things—character,
honor, integrity, service—because we
have a lot of that as well. These three
men have served our country with
great distinction. They have all been
succeeded by strong leaders who I am
sure will carry out a similar tradition
of service and dignity.
Last year, I had the great honor of
being promoted to colonel in the Ma-
rine Corps Reserves. I love being in this
job. It is a huge privilege to serve the
people of Alaska as a U.S. Senator. But
I have no doubt that the biggest honor
in my life is earning the title of U.S.
marine. I knew that I joined a force for
good, with cords of memory and valor
that stretch back to before the found-
ing of our country. The battles that the
Corps has fought in live in the heart of
every marine: Montezuma, Tripoli, Bel-
leau Wood, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, the
Chosin Reservoir, Inchon, Khe Sanh,
the Gulf War, Iraq, and Afghanistan.
The list is very long.
The greatest lesson I have learned as
a marine is what true leadership looks
like, and we have seen that true leader-
ship in the trio of officers of Kelly,
Mattis, and Dunford, and I have seen it
in their lives after the Marine Corps in
Washington, DC. Let me talk briefly
about each of them.
From his early days commanding a
rifle company and serving on two air-
craft carriers to commanding Task
Force Tripoli during the Iraq war and
leading U.S. Southern Command, Gen-
eral Kelly exemplified the warrior
ethos of the Marine Corps.
During the early days of Task Force
Tripoli, then-Major General Kelly was
asked about the ability of his force to
handle the Iraqi military. His response
was, ‘‘Hell, these are marines. Men like
them held Guadalcanal and took Iwo
Jima.’’ He had confidence, and he was
right.
General Kelly is a fighter, but he also
understands sacrifice. He lost troops in
the field, and tragically, in 2010, he lost
his own son, 1st Lt. Robert Michael
Kelly, when he stepped on an IED while
leading a platoon in Afghanistan. Gen-
eral Kelly knows sacrifice. He became
the highest ranking military officer to
lose his son or daughter in Iraq or Af-
ghanistan.
After he finished his military service
with distinction, he took on two of the
most challenging jobs here in DC: Sec-
retary of Homeland Security and then
the Chief of Staff at the White House.
He didn’t seek these jobs; he was asked
to serve by the President, and he did.
That is something unusual in a time
where so many are crawling or schem-
ing to climb up the ladder. It is refresh-
ing to have leaders who are sought out
or chosen to lead.
It should be noted that the jobs that
General Kelly took on demanded a dif-
ferent skill set after he took off the
uniform. However, on a daily basis, in
these jobs, you still take incoming; it
is just not with bullets and artillery. In
my view, he did an outstanding job in
these two very important positions at
a critical time.
Then there is General Mattis, who
became our Secretary of Defense. He
also did not seek that job; that job
sought him. I know this for a fact be-
cause, before the election, I had the
privilege of sitting down with General
Mattis when he was a scholar at the
Hoover Institution. I talked to him
about leadership and strategy. It was a
big honor for me to be able to do that
in October 2016.
After the election in November of
2016, when the rumors began swirling
about his being the Secretary of De-
fense, my first phone call to the Presi-
dent-elect to congratulate him also
mentioned how I thought it would be a
great pick to pick General Mattis as
Secretary of Defense.
I believe he did an excellent job. Gen-
eral Mattis, as the first and only ma-
rine to ever be Secretary of Defense,
played a pivotal role in redefining our
national security objectives and re-
building our military. General Mattis

played a leading role in crafting the
National Security Strategy with Na-
tional Security Advisor H.R. McMaster
in 2017 and then literally wrote almost
entirely on his own the Pentagon’s 2018
National Defense Strategy. Together,
these two documents have shifted our
Nation’s strategic focus from coun-
tering violent extremism, as we needed
to do after the September 11 terrorist
attacks, to recognizing the return of
great power competition as the leading
national security challenge for the
United States, with China as the pac-
ing threat.
It is rarely recognized by the media,
but these are very bipartisan docu-
ments in that Senators—Democrats
and Republicans—all believe these are
very, very important. They are almost
universally applauded and supported in
terms of American strategy for the
next several decades.
General Mattis recently published a
memoir, ‘‘Call Sign Chaos,’’ that cen-
ters on leadership and the need to
sharpen the mind and the body. I think
this book, which I am reading right
now, is a great service to our country.
‘‘You are part of the world’s most
feared and trusted force,’’ he tells his
marines. ‘‘Engage your brain before
you engage your weapon.’’
Indeed, much has been written about
General Mattis’s keen intellect, but, as
he makes clear, reading and intellec-
tual pursuits are not an end to them-
selves. They are part of the mission.
They are at the heart of shaping the
world’s most fearsome fighting force.
In his book, he says: ‘‘If you haven’t
read hundreds of books, learning from
others who went before you, you are
functionally illiterate—you can’t
coach and you can’t lead.’’
I also believe that General Mattis/
Secretary Mattis did an outstanding
job as Secretary of Defense. He rebuilt
our military readiness, which had
plummeted when defense spending was
cut 25 percent from 2010 to 2015. I have
walked with General Mattis/Secretary
Mattis in Alaska with our military
forces there, and I can tell you the
troops loved him and respected him.
Finally, I want to talk about General
Dunford. As I mentioned, Monday will
be the last day we get to call Dunford
America’s Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs. He is the second marine to hold
this highest leadership position in the
armed services. Also a student of his-
tory, he is known to be fearless and an
unflappable commander.
General Mattis told a great story
about how when they were serving to-
gether in Iraq—Dunford and Mattis—
General Mattis watched a rocket-pro-
pelled grenade fly over Dunford’s
humvee and blow up about 100 yards
behind him. Mattis wrote: ‘‘He
[Dunford] barely glanced up and then
went right back to writing his orders.’’
In his book, General Mattis talks
more about General Dunford. He said:
He had a gift of synthesis; he could coolly
evaluate the larger picture. Joe reminded me
of Emperor Justinian, consistently reaching
fair conclusions and able to summarize a
complex situation in a few words.
It has been precisely this ability that
has allowed General Dunford to so ef-
fectively navigate the tricky, political,
and military worlds in both this ad-
ministration and the last one. He was
nominated to be Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs by President Obama and did
such an outstanding job that President
Trump renominated him.
These are the kinds of men and lead-
ers I am talking about, and these are
not easy times. Our country and our
military are facing unprecedented
challenges, and wise counsel from
those in these positions is paramount—
those who understand what it means to
fight, what it means to be on the
frontlines of conflict, and what it
means to have the wisdom sometimes
not to fight. General Dunford has pro-
vided that wisdom.
Harlan Ullman, a combat veteran and
a U.S. Naval Academy graduate, was
recently quoted in an article about
General Dunford where he said: He has
been one of the best Joint Chiefs of
Staff America has ever had.
According to Ullman, Dunford has
been able to successfully navigate dif-
ficult times with regard to national se-
curity and challenges to our Nation in
civil and military relations.
With all the other challenges this
country has to face, it is important to
recognize these kinds of leaders.
I also want to mention how General
Dunford is known not only for his keen
intellect but also for his compassion.
He was known to personally write let-
ters to the parents of his marines who
were killed in action. He was the per-
son who went to General Kelly’s home
to tell him that his own son had been
killed in battle in Afghanistan, and
later, he wore a Team Kelly shirt when
he ran the Boston Marathon.
I have seen that personal compassion
in my own life. It is a story I will end
with with regard to all three of these
men, and it involves a young lance cor-
poral from Alaska named Grant Fraser.
Who is Grant Fraser? In high school
in Anchorage, he was an actor who
loved the works of Homer and Shake-
speare. He was a mountain biker, a
skier, a pianist, a scuba diver, a rock
climber, a tennis player, a light-
hearted, mischievous young man, and
then he surprised family and friends
when he joined the Marines. While still
in college, because he wanted chal-
lenges and he knew he would thrive in
the Marine Corps—and he did thrive in
the Marine Corps—he planned on com-
ing back home to work as a paramedic
with the Anchorage Fire Department.
On August 3, 2005, in Anbar Province,
Iraq, Grant Fraser was on a mission—
Operation Quick Strike—to avenge the
killing of his fellow marines when his
vehicle was hit by a massive impro-
vised explosive device. He was 22 years
old when he made the ultimate sac-
rifice.
I love our military, but sometimes it
can be bureaucratic and very bone-
headed. It took 11 long years and the
tenacious, beautiful spirit of Grant
Fraser’s mom, Sharon Long, for this
young marine to get a proper burial at
Arlington Cemetery.
Two days before the funeral in 2016, I
was sitting next to General Dunford at
a dinner. I told him about Grant’s her-
oism and Sharon Long’s heroic perse-
verance to get her son buried at Arling-
ton.
On an overcast day, September 30,
2016, as friends, family, and fellow ma-
rines were gathering to put Grant Fra-
ser to rest at Arlington National Ceme-
tery, a marine four-star general in his
dress blues appeared solemnly on the
sidelines. The most important member
of the U.S. military decided to move
his schedule and come to the funeral of
this lance corporal.
I had the opportunity to introduce
him to Sharon Long. The Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs told me that he
couldn’t sleep the night before, think-
ing about how long it took for her to
bury her son, and he felt that he just
had to attend to pay his respects to
this marine.
I have been to a lot of funerals in my
Marine Corps career, but this was the
most moving funeral I ever attended. It
was moving because on that day, rank
didn’t matter and medals didn’t mat-
ter; we were all just Americans—with
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff—grieving the loss of one of our
own.
General Mattis wrote, ‘‘No Marine is
ever alone—he carries with him the
spirit passed on from generations be-
fore him. Group spirit—that electric
force field of emotion—infuses and
binds warriors together.’’
These three men—Mattis, Kelly, and
Dunford—have brought that spirit,
that higher calling, not just to the Ma-
rine Corps but to America and the
highest levels of government, and we
should all be thankful.
We in the Senate confirm these men
and women on a regular basis—people
willing to serve their country—but we
rarely thank them on the floor. So
from one U.S. Senator who has
watched the careers of these remark-
able three men closely and appreciates
what they have done, not just in uni-
form but after they have taken off the
uniform, I want to thank them for
their honor, courage, commitment,
sacrifice, and example to thousands if
not millions of Americans and marines
and for keeping us safe.
So to Generals Mattis, Kelly, and
Dunford, thank you. Semper Fidelis.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
want to start by saluting my friend,
our colleague, the Senator from Alas-
ka, for his moving and powerful state-
ment and for his service as a marine
and now a Senator from Alaska. It has
been a great honor to work with him
on many issues, including national se-
curity issues.

I thank you.
FUTURE ACT
Mr. President, earlier today on this
Senate floor, our colleague, the junior
Senator from Alabama, Mr. JONES,
asked unanimous consent for the im-
mediate passage of the FUTURE Act.
The FUTURE Act is an important
bill that is essential to the success of
minority-serving colleges and univer-
sities across the country, including his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities.
The House bill passed within the last
couple weeks. The bill number is H.R.
2486, and it is at the Senate desk,
meaning we could take it up and pass
it at any moment if the leader would
simply allow us to vote on that meas-
ure. What it does is it extends an exist-
ing mandatory funding program that
provides essential resources to these
underresourced schools.
We, as the Congress, the Senate and
House, Republicans and Democrats,
recognize on a bipartisan basis the
value of these institutions of higher
learning and the importance of this
mandatory funding because we enacted
this program a number of years ago on
a bipartisan basis. The goal was to
make sure that we provided additional
resources for academic pursuits, to im-
prove management, and to ensure that
they had the resources for high-demand
areas of study in the areas of science,
technology, engineering, and math—
the STEM disciplines.
In my State of Maryland, we have
four terrific HBCUs: Morgan State,
Bowie State, Coppin State, and the
University of Maryland Eastern Shore.
We also have a number of other schools
with a high number of students receiv-
ing need-based aid, like Allegany Col-
lege in Western Maryland and the Col-
lege of Southern Maryland. All of these
colleges and universities need the re-
sources that are provided through the
FUTURE Act.
It not only has a bipartisan heritage,
but right now in the Senate, it has a bi-
partisan cosponsorship. In fact, Sen-
ator SCOTT is the lead Republican on
this bill. It passed the House of Rep-
resentatives unanimously on a voice
vote.
The reason I am on the floor now and
the reason the Senator from Alabama,
Senator JONES, asked for unanimous
consent to take this up and vote on it
earlier today is because the current
mandatory program expires on Mon-
day. It expires at the end of this
month. There is no reason for delaying
action. It is possible that we can buy
ourselves a little bit more time with
respect to the funding, but there is no
reason that we should put this impor-
tant program at risk.
I have a number of letters. In fact, I
have 43 letters from 34 schools and ad-
vocacy organizations supporting this
bill. I ask unanimous consent to have
some of them printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY IN HIGHER EDU-
CATION,
September 1, 2019.
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL,
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER,
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
DEAR LEADER MCCONNELL AND LEADER
SCHUMER: In less than two weeks, congres-
sional authority and vitally needed funding
for Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities (HBCUs), Predominantly Black Insti-
tutions (PBIs), Tribal Colleges and Univer-
sities (TCUs) Hispanic-serving Institutions
(HSIs), Asian American, Native American,
and Pacific Islander-serving Institutions
(AANAPISIs), will end, unless Congress acts
by September 30, 2019, to extend the author-
ity and funding. Yesterday, the United
States House of Representatives moved the
Nation toward extending the funding for an-
other two years, when it voted with bipar-
tisan support, to pass the Fostering Under-
graduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for
Education (FUTURE) Act, a bipartisan
measure to preserve funding for the ref-
erenced quintessential American equal edu-
cational opportunity institutions.
I am writing as President & CEO of the Na-
tional Associational for Equal Opportunity
in Higher Education (NAFEO). I am writing
to respectfully request and urge that you
schedule for a vote the Senate companion of
the House-passed FUTURE Act, introduced
by Senators Tim Scott (SC) and Doug Jones
(AL), and that you support this measure that
has made critical investments in HBCUs and
MSIs, enabling them to graduate more excel-
lent and diverse students, disproportionate
low-income, first generation and under-rep-
resented minority students, in growth and
high need disciplines. With your support the
Senate FUTURE Act will pass.
The FUTURE Act will be wholly paid for.
It preserves and extends vital investments in
institutions that collectively enroll more
than 4.8 million undergraduate students in
the U.S.—one-quarter of all students—and
represent over 800 richly diverse American
universities: 106 Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs), 50 Predominantly
Black Institutions (PBIs); 523 Hispanic-Serv-
ing Institutions (HSIs), 37 Tribal Colleges
and Universities (TCUs), and over 200 Asian
American and Native American Pacific Is-
lander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISls), in-
cluding Kentucky State University, and
CUNY Medgar Evers College, CUNY York
College, CUNY LaGuardia, CUNY New York
City College of Technology, Metropolitan
College of New York, and Long Island Uni-
versity-Brooklyn Campus.
As you know, HBCUs, PBIs, HSIs, TCUs,
and AANAPISIs are an essential part of
America’s higher education system. For the
past decade, Title III, Part F has played a
vital role in strengthening their capacity
and increasing credentialing and degree at-
tainment, including in important STEM
fields. If this critical funding stream is al-
lowed to expire on September 30, 2019, mil-
lions of students will be left behind, in the
margins of our nation, without the oppor-
tunity to earn a college degree or credential.
Please do not let this happen. Title III, Part
F is the lifeblood for these institutions. The
most certain way, the most effective and ef-
ficient way of extending the only mandatory
congressional funding for HBCUs and MSIs,
is to vote for the Senate companion of the
House-passed FUTURE Act, introduced by
Senators Scott (SC) and Jones (AL). Please
lead the United States Senate in making this
happen.
Sincerely,
LEZLI BASKERVILLE,
President & CEO.

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, MI-
NORITY LEADER SCHUMER, CHAIRMAN ALEX-
ANDER, AND RANKING MEMBER MURRAY: UNCF
(the United Negro College Fund, Inc.) sub-
mits this letter urging you to cosponsor,
support, and pass the House-passed H.R. 2486,
the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by
Unlocking Resources for Education (FU-
TURE) Act. This bipartisan, bicameral bill
passed the House Floor on September 17th by
voice vote and has now been sent to the Sen-
ate for consideration.
UNCF is a non-profit organization with a
mission to build a robust and nationally rec-
ognized pipeline of underrepresented stu-
dents who, because of UNCF support, become
highly-qualified college graduates and to en-
sure that our network of 37-member, private
Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) is a respected model of best practice
in moving students to and through college.
The 101 HBCUs that exist today are valu-
able institutions with a large economic foot-
print. Despite only representing 3 percent of
all two-and four-year non-profit colleges and
universities, HBCUs (1) enroll 10 percent of
all African American undergraduates; (2)
produce 17 percent of all African American
college graduates with bachelor’s degrees;
and (3) graduate 21 percent of all African
Americans with bachelor’s degrees in STEM
fields. Moreover, these institutions have a
strong economic impact, especially on the
regions in which they are located, by cre-
ating 134,090 jobs, producing $10.1 billion in
terms of gross regional product, and having
a total annual economic impact of $14.8 bil-
lion.
Despite the large economic impact of these
institutions, they continue to be
underresourced and have endowments that
lag behind those of non-HBCUs by at least 70
percent. Unfortunately, this is common for
HBCUs and Congress has recognized this and
sought out ways to find parity between
HBCUs and non-HBCUs. One strategic way in
attempting to help HBCUs receive adequate
resources was initially through the College
Cost and Reduction Act of 2007. This bill al-
lowed for HBCUs, Tribal Colleges and Uni-
versities (TCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institu-
tions (HSIs), and other Minority-Serving In-
stitutions (MSIs) to receive $255 million an-
nually in mandatory funds for Fiscal Year
(FY) 2008 and FY 2009. These mandatory
funds were directed in the Higher Education
Act of 1965 to be used solely for science, tech-
nology, education, and mathematics (STEM)
education, among other uses largely cen-
tered around STEM. Instead of allowing this
funding stream to expire, Congress continued
to recognize the need of these institutions to
offer quality STEM programs on their cam-
puses and continued this funding stream in
the Student Aid Fiscal Responsibility Act
(SAFRA) of 2009. SAFRA extended funding

for these institutions from FY 2009 to FY
2019 at $255 million annually and was in-
cluded in the Health Care Reconciliation Act
of 2010 that ultimately passed both the
House and Senate to became law. Every vote
taken on the mandatory funding stream for
these institutions has been bipartisan, and it
is our desire to have the same outcome for
H.R. 2486.
It is imperative that the Senate pass the
FUTURE Act because funding for HBCUs,
TCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs expires Sep-
tember 30, 2019. While we support a perma-
nent extension of mandatory funding, H.R.
2486, due to its passage in the House of Rep-
resentatives, is the surest way for these in-
stitutions to maintain funding for FY 2020
and FY 2021. We strongly believe that pass-
ing this bill now will address the immediate
funding needs of our institutions and allow
Congress to continue to work towards a per-
manent extension of this funding moving for-
ward.
Should you have any additional questions
regarding this letter, please feel free to
reach out to Emmanual Guillory, Director of
Public Policy and Government Affairs.
Sincerely,

TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,
September 25, 2019.
Hon. LAMAR ALEXANDER,
Chairman Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee, Member, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SENATOR ALEXANDER: I am writing to
you in my official capacity as President of
Tennessee State University, and as a mem-
ber of the Board of Directors of the United
Negro College Fund (UNCF). I ask you to
join in the effort calling for unanimous con-
sent to vote to pass the Scott-Jones FU-
TURE Act, the Senate companion bill to the
FUTURE Act that passed the House last
week by unanimous consent.
I understand and appreciate the note-
worthy components to the bill you are pro-
posing, however my request is for you to
consider the timing aspect which presents a
challenge that threatens the Title III F pro-
vision in the Higher Education Act that will
end on September 30th unless it is extended.
Again, I am appreciative of the various pro-
visions that you are proposing that will have
a positive effect on HBCUs. In fact, I am per-
sonally excited that you are advancing HEA
reauthorization as a priority, as well as
broadening Pell eligibility. Hopefully, that
proposal will be debated shortly after the im-
mediate future of HBCUs and MSIs are se-
cured.
My primary issue at this point is the tim-
ing of your legislation which could cause an
inordinate delay that would affect Histori-
cally Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions
(MSIs). I am quite concerned that with only
a few days remaining before Title III F ends,
the only way we can ensure passage of this
FUTURE Act is by a unanimous consent by
the Senate.
Based on your long, illustrious and rich
record of service to our state as Governor of
the State of Tennessee, and to the country as
Secretary of the United States Department
of Education, I am sure you would agree that
it is a priority to continue the Title III F
funding for HBCUs, thereby providing much
needed assistance to students around the
country. Many of this population are low-in-
come, first-generation college students, all
with a strong desire to be successful in col-
lege. If Title III F sunsets on September 30,
2019, it will cause irreparable harm to the
very students you represent in our great
State of Tennessee. I urge you to support the
FUTURE Act today and engage in further
discussions on other aspects of the legisla-
tion in the near future.
Thank you for your consideration of this
request. Please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely,
DR. GLENDA GLOVER, JD, CPA
President.

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, MI-
NORITY LEADER SCHUMER, CHAIRMAN ALEX-
ANDER, AND RANKING MEMBER MURRAY: On
behalf of the nation’s 37 Tribal Colleges and
Universities, which are the American Indian
Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), we
respectfully request that you to support
swift Senate passage of the Fostering Under-
graduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for
Education (FUTURE) Act, H.R. 2486, as
passed by the House with strong bipartisan
support, while working to secure a perma-
nent extension of Title III Part F of the
Higher Education Act 1965.
Since FY2010, the Strengthening Institu-
tions—Tribal Colleges and Universities pro-
gram (HEA Title III Part F) has provided $30
million per year to help TCUs address the
higher education needs of American Indian
and Alaska Native students, TCUs use this
funding for vitally needed student support
services, faculty development, curriculum
and program development to strengthen trib-
al nations, library services, facility mod-
ernization and construction and other impor-
tant education activities. Without these
funds, TCUs will be forced to reduce services,
jeopardizing student completion and success,
and some of our smaller institutions may
face closure.
Tribal Colleges and Universities truly are
developing institutions—the oldest TCU re-
cently reached its 50th year; we are located
in some of the most rural, remote, and eco-
nomically challenged regions of the country;
we are severely under-resourced; and yet, we
are committed to affordable, high quality,
place-based and culturally grounded higher
education. Our ability to achieve our collec-
tive vision—strong sovereign Tribal nations
through excellence in Tribal higher edu-
cation—would be impossible without the
Title III Part F program.
We have always supported and worked for
permanent reauthorization of the Title III
Part F program for Tribal Colleges and Uni-
versities, Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions,
and other minority serving institutions. We
are not wavering from this critical goal.
However, the House-passed FUTURE Act,
H.R. 2486, is the best path forward at this
time. Indeed, the House-passed FUTURE Act
is the only tangible strategy before us, and
time is running out.
Thank you for your attention to this re-
quest and for your support of our institu-
tions and the students we serve.
Sincerely,
CARRIE L. BILLY,
President & CEO.

MSIs

Health, Education Labor and Pensions.
DEAR SENATORS:
The Thurgood Marshall College Fund
(TMCF) is incredibly pleased and grateful
that the Title III, Part F funding that is cur-
rently slated to expire on September 30th
has garnered considerable interest from and
corresponding action this week in Congress.
As you may be aware, his critical stream of
funding helps eligible colleges and univer-
sities enhance their fiscal stability, improve
their institutional management, and
strengthen their academic programming, in-
cluding, in particular, programming focused
on high-demand careers, like careers in
STEM fields.
As you may know, on Tuesday, September
17th, the House of Representatives passed
the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by
Unlocking Resources for Education (FU-
TURE) Act by voice vote. If passed by both
houses of Congress and signed into law by
President Trump, the FUTURE Act will
renew Title III, Part F (a/k/a SAFRA) fund-
ing for an additional two years, and thereby
preserving critical funds upon which our
HBCUs and other MSIs rely to improve the
lives of our students.
TMCF strongly encourages the Senate to
take-up the FUTURE Act immediately and
pass the bill before the opportunity slips
away. While we appreciate the prospects of a
longer-term or ‘‘permanent’’ solution to
Title III, Part F, we are skeptical that such
a proposal would receive the requisite ap-
proval by Congress before September 30th.
Therefore, it is imperative that the Senate
to act with all deliberate speed on the bi-par-
tisan and bi-cameral FUTURE Act. Fol-
lowing the Senate’s passage of FUTURE Act,
TMCF is willing to work with leaders on
both sides of the aisle to develop a longer-
term solution for Title III, Part F and for
other HEA-related issues.
We greatly appreciate your attention to
this matter, and thank you for your historic
and, we anticipate, continued commitment
to our Nation’s HBCUs, other MSIs and our
students.
Sincerely,
DR. HARRY L. WILLIAMS,
President & CEO.

DEAR LEADER MCCONNELL, LEADER SCHU-
MER, CHAIRMAN ALEXANDER, AND RANKING
MEMBER MURRAY: In just 10 days, on Sep-
tember 30, 2019, Title III, Part F of the High-
er Education Act of 1965 will expire unless
the Senate acts before then to extend it. I
strongly urge you and your Senate col-
leagues to act swiftly in passing the FU-
TURE Act (H.R. 2486), which was passed by
the House two days ago, to ensure that crit-
ical funding is uninterrupted for the more
than 4.5 million undergraduate students en-
rolled at Hispanic-Serving Institutions
(HSIs) alone. In addition, hundreds of thou-
sands of students at Historically Black Col-
leges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Col-
leges and Universities (TCUs), and other Mi-
nority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) would be
impacted.
The House-passed FUTURE Act represents
the best path to ensure the above institu-
tions don’t lose critical funding on Sep-
tember 30, 2019.
HSIs, HBCUs, TCUs, and other MSIs are an
essential part of America’s higher education
system and workforce development. For the
past decade, Title III, Part F has played a
vital role in strengthening the STEM pipe-
line at these institutions and increasing
their capacity for credentialing and degree
attainment.
The mandatory funding for Title III, Part
F was initially included in the 2008 College
Cost Reduction and Access Act for two years
and was extended until FY 2019 in the Health
Care Education and Reconciliation Act of
2010. Title III, Part F of the legislation has
always had bipartisan and bicameral support
because of its important role in increasing
student persistence and graduation rates,
particularly in STEM fields, at HSIs, HBCUs,
TCUs, and other MSIs. Thus, it is imperative
that Congress extends Title III, Part F via
the FUTURE Act since it is a lifeline for
these institutions.
HSIs alone account for 15 percent of all
non-profit colleges and universities, and yet
enroll 66 percent of all Hispanic students and
nearly one-fourth of all U.S. students. De-
spite having access to fewer resources com-
pared to other institutions, HSIs impres-
sively produce 40 percent of the STEM bach-
elor’s degrees earned by Latino students.
Their future is in the balance.
As our nation becomes increasingly diverse
and the number of HSIs continues to grow,
Title III, Part F funding is more essential
than ever to ensure that we can prepare to-
day’s students for tomorrow’s jobs and re-
duce our nation’s dependence on foreign tal-
ent.
With time running out, we appeal to you to
use the power and influence of your leader-
ship positions to pass the House-passed FU-
TURE Act before September 30, 2019. We look
forward to continuing our shared efforts to
find a permanent extension of Title III, Part
F.
If you have any questions please feel free
to contact Alicia Diaz, HACU’s Interim Chief
Advocacy Officer.
We thank you in advance for your time and
look forward to a timely passage of the FU-
TURE Act.
Sincerely,
ANTONIO R. FLORES,
President & CEO.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
am going to read from just two of those
letters that expressed the urgency of
Senate action on this.
This is a letter from the Thurgood
Marshall College Fund, from the presi-
dent and CEO, stating that the
Thurgood Marshall College Fund
‘‘strongly encourages the Senate to
take-up the FUTURE Act immediately
and pass the bill before the opportunity
slips away. While we appreciate the
prospects of a longer-term or ‘perma-
nent’ solution to Title III, Part F, we
are skeptical that such a proposal
would receive the requisite approval by
Congress before September 30th.’’
I think we can understand their skep-
ticism given the fact that the 30th is
Monday and the Senate is going to be
out this afternoon.
They go on to say:
Therefore, it is imperative that the Senate
act with all deliberate speed on the bi-par-
tisan, bi-cameral FUTURE Act.
Mr. President, I have another letter
from the UNCF, which is another orga-
nization dedicated to supporting these
important institutions.
Quoting from the letter from their
president and CEO:
It is imperative that the Senate pass the
FUTURE Act because funding for HBCUs,
TCUs, HSIs, and other [minority-serving in-
stitutions] expires September 30, 2019. While
we support a permanent extension of manda-
tory funding, H.R. 2846, due to its passage in
the House of Representatives, is the surest
way for these institutions to maintain fund-
ing for FY 2020 and FY 2021. We strongly be-
lieve that passing this bill now will address
the immediate funding needs of our institu-
tions.
This is a bill that has broad support.
This is a bill where—the program ex-
pires on Monday, just a few days from
now. There is really no excuse for not
taking this up and voting on it now. I
hope, since that is obviously not going
to happen—my colleague tried to get
unanimous consent earlier today to
take up and vote on this bill—I hope we
will move with all deliberate speed as

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
THE WORKING CLASS IN AMERICA
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, earlier
this week, the Missouri Department of
Health issued a new report that shows
that life expectancy actually declined
in the State of Missouri last year.
Worse than that, the report shows that
life expectancy has been falling in my
State for almost a decade. Death rates
for Missourians between 15 and 34 years
old rose by almost 30 percent between
2012 and 2018. The death rate for Mis-
sourians who are between 25 and 34 is
at its highest levels since the 1950s. We
know what is causing it. It is an epi-
demic of drug overdoses and suicides,
along with a spike in crime, in our cit-
ies.
Here are the facts. Opioid-related
deaths in Missouri have more than dou-
bled in the last decade. The number of
suicides is up by over 50 percent, and
there is no end in sight. And it is not
just Missouri. New data shows that
deaths from suicides and drug
overdoses are exploding nationwide.
Suicides in this country haven’t been
so common since 1938. Alcohol-related
deaths haven’t been so high since the
1910s. Meanwhile, the surge in deaths
from drug overdoses in this country is
completely unprecedented.
These numbers are tragic, but they
are more than that—they are the signs
of a crisis. We are witnessing the slow-
motion collapse of the working class in
America.
All Americans suffer from the depths
of despair, but we know from the evi-
dence that it is working people and
working families who are hit the hard-
est. So now the working middle of this
Nation is facing a struggle to survive.
You don’t have to look far to see it.
I have seen it in the small towns of
my State, in the places where TV cam-
eras never go, where town squares sit
half empty, where businesses stand
shuttered, where you can buy fentanyl
with the snap of a finger on any street
corner.
I have seen it in country places
where meth is so common, they tell me
that dealers hang bags of drugs from
tree branches for their buyers to re-
trieve—a literal landscape of despair
and addiction.
I have seen it in the faces of young
farmers who put a crop in and pray for
rain and pray for Sun and pray for fair
prices and then wonder if generations
of family farming are going to end with
them.
I have seen it from young mothers
raising kids alone, working a job and
trying to go to school at night, trying
to shield their children from drugs and
from the pathologies online.
I have heard it in the words of young
men who graduated high school only to
find no jobs, no place to learn a trade,
and no hope for anything that is better.
This is the struggle of working life
today. In my State, it is a struggle
shared by White and Black alike, by
everybody of every race, because of the
breakdown of family and neighborhood,
the loss of good work, and the epidemic
of addictive drugs, which don’t know
racial boundaries.
This is a struggle we are in together.
It is a struggle that brings us together.
It is a struggle for the things we love
together—for home, family, and coun-
try—and the future of this country will
be defined by how we meet this chal-
lenge.
You can see all of this if you will
look. The problem is this town will not
look. This town is obsessed with par-
tisan theatrics. This town is obsessed
with money and influence and status.
This town wants to keep its own good

times going. The political elite here
live in a world where the struggle of
working Americans is just a human in-
terest story that you read about right
along with the gossip page.
But it is time for this town to take
some responsibility. It is time for the
governing class to admit that the poli-
cies it has pursued for decades on
trade, on immigration, and on finance
have helped to drive working people to
this crisis. And it is time to acknowl-
edge that a crisis for working America
is a crisis for all of America. It is not
enough for wealthy people in Silicon
Valley to do well. By the way, those
people don’t need any more advocates
in this city. They have lots of them al-
ready. It is working people who need
advocates here, and it is working fami-
lies who need a voice.
You know, working folks don’t ask
for much. They work hard. They love
their families, they love God, they love
the place where they live, and they
want the opportunity to build a home
there and a way of life that is pros-
perous and that is secure and that is
meaningful and that they can pass on
to their children. That is not too much
to ask. In the America of the 21st cen-
tury, that is not too much to expect. It
is not too much to stand for and to
fight for because it is the working peo-
ple of this country who built this Na-
tion. They are the ones who keep it
going now, and they are the ones where
this country’s strength is found. It is
the working people of this country—
their future and their families—who
are going to define the future of our
country.
I would just say that this is what we
should be debating. This challenge is
what we should be confronting. This
crisis is what we should be looking to
and addressing because this is what is
going to define our time.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I have to
admit that I haven’t had a heck of a lot
of sleep the last few nights, and I don’t
think anyone has. If anyone has rested
well the last few nights, it is because
they are either not paying attention or
they are here for the wrong reason.
We are in some troubled times.
Events of the past 2 weeks have been
nothing short of stunning. They have
been stunning in the speed in which
they have unfolded. They have been
stunning and disturbing in the allega-
tions that have been made regarding
the conduct of the President of the
United States. These are allegations
that go to the heart of national secu-
rity and allegations that go to the
heart of whether or not the President
is upholding his oath to the Constitu-
tion of the United States or abusing
the power of the Presidency.
We have to remember in this body,
and we have to remind our colleagues,
we have to remind the media, and we
have to remind the public that we are
just now beginning this process. The
facts have not come out. We are just
now beginning to see facts and deter-
mining what happened over the course
of this past summer—where things
were, what happened, what was said,
and who said it. We have to determine
the allegations and whether or not
they have merit based on the facts that
come out, not just reports in the media
or even the allegations in a complaint.
I am a lawyer. Allegations in a com-
plaint are just simply allegations
made, but they have to be proven.
The reason I rise today is that al-
ready we are seeing this becoming po-
litical. People are going to their polit-
ical corners. The partisan tribalism is
taking over already, and that is unfor-
tunate. It is a sad commentary when a
process that is so rooted in the Con-
stitution of the United States—some-
thing so fundamental to our democ-
racy—is almost immediately cast in
political terms. My colleague and
friend, Senator SASSE from Nebraska,
used the term ‘‘partisan tribalism’’ in
today’s world that is ‘‘insta-certain.’’
No matter what you see, no matter
what you read, it doesn’t matter be-
cause you are going to take a side, and
when we take sides, the American pub-
lic immediately take sides and no one
listens to the facts.
We are called as Senators, we are
called as Members of the House, and we
are called as Members of this body to a
much higher duty than that—a much
higher duty. Our duty is to carefully
analyze and review the facts—facts,
not mere allegations; facts, not reports
or leaks; facts, not what some political
talking head on the television says
their opinion might be. Our duty is so
much higher than that.
We have seen already some of what
appear to be very disturbing facts. We
have seen a summary of a telephone
call between the President of the
United States and the President of
Ukraine. Ukraine is a country depend-
ent on countries like the United
States. The balance of power between
the United States and Ukraine is not
balanced at all. We have so much more
power, and in the summary of that
call, the President of the United States
noted that to the President of Ukraine.
He said, essentially: You are dependent
on us. No one else helps you, but you
can count on the United States of
America. And, by the way, I need a
favor. I need you to do me a personal
political favor.
In that conversation, he talked about
not only having his personal lawyer
but also utilizing the Attorney General
of the United States to help benefit
them politically. Those are initially
the facts, and they are very disturbing.
For anyone to say that they are not is
shirking their responsibility to their
constituents, to the public, to the Con-
stitution, and to the very oath that we
took when we came into this body.
But again, it is but one piece of a
puzzle. We have now also seen the con-
tents of the so-called whistleblower
complaint. ‘‘Whistleblower’’ is a term
of art. A whistleblower is just simply
somebody who has come forward, but
they are given the name whistleblower
because they are given legal protec-
tions. These people who come forward
are concerned citizens of the United
States. It is a concerned citizen of the
United States who saw something hap-
pening that disturbed him so much
that he felt compelled to bring it to
someone’s attention. They are docu-
mented fairly well, but again, these
facts have not come out. They are just
statements in an allegation in a com-
plaint that have to be determined.
I have been asked over and over by
the media in the last 2 days: Do you
support the House doing this? Do you
support impeachment? Do you support
this or that?
My comment is always the same: I
want to know the facts. It doesn’t mat-
ter to me what the House of Represent-
atives, in their prerogative, calls their
processes. I want to know the facts.
The American people deserve to know
the facts. This body deserves to know
the facts, whether or not anything
comes over from the House of Rep-
resentatives. We deserve to know
whether or not the President is abusing
his office. We deserve to know whether
or not he is placing our national secu-
rity at risk because, remember,
Ukraine is under threat from Russia
every day. Every day they are looking
over their shoulder. Every day they are
looking over their shoulder. That puts
us at risk, as well. We have to make
sure that we are deliberate, that we
move forward with a process that is de-
liberate. We owe it to the American
people to be deliberate, to be somber,
to be making sure that we know the
facts before we make our judgments.
It doesn’t matter what side of the
aisle you are on. This is not a Repub-
lican process. This is not a Democratic
process. And for God’s sake, it is not a
socialist agenda. That is about the
dumbest thing that I have heard people
say over the last two days. Good Lord,
we are talking about a process that is
rooted in the Constitution of the
United States. It is rooted in the Con-
stitution of the United States for a
purpose—part of the checks and bal-
ances that seem to be going out the
window these days in our society and
in our government and here in Wash-
ington, DC. This is an American agen-
da to make sure that we know the facts
and that we understand those facts so
people who are around here watching
this today know and can be secure in
the fact that their Congress is doing
their job, that the President is doing
his job, that the courts are doing their
job.
This is not the time to circle the
wagons around the President, but, like-
wise, it is not the time to make a judg-
ment already that this President
should be removed from office or even
for articles of impeachment voted on
by the House. This is not the time to
do that. We are beginning a process

that we have to take our time on. I say
that knowing that when we say ‘‘take
our time,’’ we just need to be delib-
erate, but we need to move. This is not
something that needs to drag on. This
is not something through which the
American public needs to be dragged
over the course of too long a period of
time. This can be determined.
If you look at that whistleblower
complaint that was filed, this is some-
thing that should easily be able to be
done in a relatively short period of
time if the administration will cooper-
ate and if we get that instead of the
stonewalling that we have seen in the
past.
Cooperate with us. Do your job. Do
your duty and let us do ours. That is
all that we ask. That is all that any-
body should ever ask of anyone in this
body or anyone in the House of Rep-
resentatives. Let us do our job.
We are about to leave this place for a
couple of weeks. The House is leaving,
though they may still do a little work.
We are going to be leaving for 2 weeks.
We are going back home to our States.
We are going to be talking to the
media. We are going to be talking to
constituents. I guarantee you that
when I go back to Alabama, a lot of
people will have already made up their
minds. When I go to a townhall or
whatever, they will have made up their
minds without any facts. They make
up their mind based on the media.
My friends in the media need to pay
attention too. Don’t ask me whether or
not this is going to affect my election
in 2020. Don’t ask me if it is going to
affect Joe Biden or Donald Trump, or
ask me if it is going to affect the Presi-
dential race. Ask me about what is
going to happen to the Constitution
and what is going to happen to the rule
of law. Let’s talk about the seriousness
of what we have and not the politics of
it, for goodness’ sake.
But every time I turn around, when I
walk out of these doors, the first thing
they are going to ask me is this: How
do you think this is going to affect
your race?
That is not my job. That is not my
oath. That is not my duty. If we put
our fingers to the political winds with
everything we do in this body, we may
as well not be here. We should not be
able to live with ourselves. Unfortu-
nately, I think so many people do that.
I am hoping that in this day, in this
time, in these troubled waters we are
about to embark on, people will see
that higher calling and that they will
once again return to that time and
that place when this Senate was a de-
liberative body and not a knee-jerk re-
action to a particular program or nom-
ination or whatever that comes before
it. We will return to the days of yester-
year where we actually deliberate and
we talk amongst ourselves and we have
a civil discussion about the important
issues that we are faced with. I remem-
ber those days. I was here. I was sitting
back there as a Senate staffer, watch-
ing those great debates and watching
people change their minds on the floor
of the Senate because of the debate
that someone gave and someone per-
suaded him. We don’t have those any
more. Look around right now. We are
all gone, except those people around
here listening to me, and I have staff
here. But we don’t have those debates
any more. We don’t have those delib-
erations any more. We are going to
have to now. We are going to have to
because the Republic depends on it.
The fate of this country will depend on
it. We are so divided in this country
right now. We are living in what Ar-
thur Brooks has called that ‘‘culture of
contempt,’’ where we don’t necessarily
just disagree with each other. We hold
each other in contempt if we disagree
with each other.
We have to change that, folks. We
have to get back. We have to change
that. We have to make sure people un-
derstand their roles and their duties.
We have to make sure that for this
country to progress and for this coun-
try to survive, we have to work to-
gether.
We have to be one America. We can’t
be so divided. That is exactly what our
enemies have been trying to do to us
for centuries. For two centuries or
more, they have wanted to divide us,
and they came close during the Civil
War. They are going to come close now
if we are not careful. If we don’t stop
folks on both sides of the aisle from
continuing to pull us into our corners
but rather start pulling people back to
where we can have these discussions,
we will be in trouble.
As we go forward and as we go into
this recess, I hope all of my colleagues
will remember their oaths. I hope peo-
ple will remember what they said when
they stood right over there and the
Vice President of the United States
asked them to raise their right hands
and say: ‘‘I do solemnly swear that I
will support and defend the Constitu-
tion of the United States against all
enemies, foreign and domestic.’’
We took an oath to support the Con-
stitution. We didn’t take an oath to
support the President of the United
States. We didn’t take an oath to sup-
port the Republican Party. We didn’t
take an oath to support the Demo-
cratic Party. We took an oath to de-
fend the Constitution of the United
States against all enemies, foreign and
domestic. That is an important part
that our Framers put in the Constitu-
tion, ‘‘foreign and domestic.’’
We said we would take this obliga-
tion freely without any mental res-
ervation or purpose of evasion. We can-
not evade. We took an oath not to
evade while we were here—that is not
what we do—and to well and faithfully
discharge the duties of the office on
which we entered.
Our duties to this office are to be
fair, to be impartial, and to be delib-
erative, not political. Our duties to
this office are to our constituents and
to do the very best we can to make
sure we analyze whatever is in front of
us because history will judge us. It will
determine whether or not we acted
with courage and conviction or wheth-
er we just simply tested the political
winds as some people are already
doing.
Often in my talks around the country
and in some even here, I like to quote
one of my favorite characters from lit-
erature, Atticus Finch. Atticus Finch
gave an impassioned closing argument
to a jury he knew was not likely to
give him the verdict he sought. He laid
out a case in defense of Tom Robinson,
a Black man who was accused of raping
a White woman. In that defense, he
went through the facts. Everybody who
has ever read the book and everybody
who has ever watched the movie knows
Tom Robinson was innocent, but
Atticus Finch knew that the likelihood
of the jury’s finding that man innocent
was slim and none.
At the end of that closing argument,
he talked about the solemn duty, the
solemn obligation, that the jurors had
to the system. He talked about the jus-
tice system and the courts and the ju-
rors being the great levelers of society,
where the pauper and the rich man
were the same in the eyes of the law.
He talked about the duty they had to
fairly and impartially judge the facts.
Just before he sat down—and you
could see it and feel it, and if you were
to read the book, you could feel that
Atticus knew what was going to hap-
pen—he looked that jury in the eye and
said: ‘‘[Gentlemen], in the name of
God, do your duty.’’
Ladies and gentlemen and colleagues,
in the name of God, we have to do our
duty. We have to do our duty. We have
to make sure we fulfill our oaths and
not be concerned about how many
votes it might get us or how many
votes we might lose. Whether we know
the outcome or not, whether we get
pressure from Assad or not, whether or
not there are millions of dollars spent
on TV and in radio so as to tell us to
vote a certain way, we have to fulfill
that solemn obligation. In the name of
God, we should do our duty and noth-
ing less.

TRIBUTE TO MARCELLA RYAN
LEBEAU
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it is al-
ways a privilege to honor the men and
women of America’s Greatest Genera-
tion. They brought peace to the world
and defended the freedoms we all enjoy
every day, and we owe them a tremen-
dous debt of gratitude for their service
and sacrifice.
Today, I wish to recognize one of
these heroic Americans from my home
State of South Dakota. Marcella Ryan
LeBeau volunteered to serve in the
U.S. Army Nurse Corps during World
War II—WWII—providing care to
wounded soldiers across Europe. Next
month, Marcella will enjoy her 100th
birthday at a celebration with family
and friends, and I wish to add my voice
to the chorus of those praising her life-
time of achievement and dedication to
public service.
Marcella has dedicated her life to
serving others. She completed a di-
ploma in nursing at St. Mary’s Hos-
pital in Pierre, SD, in 1942 and served
in the Army Nurse Corps as a first lieu-
tenant in WWII, taking her from the
United States to Wales, England,
France, and Belgium. While serving in
the Army from 1942 to 1946, Marcella
cared for countless wounded soldiers,
including D-Day and the Battle of the
Bulge.
In 2004, on the 60th anniversary of D-
Day, Marcella was among 100 WWII
American veterans awarded France’s
highest civilian award, the French Le-
gion of Honor, at the French Embassy
in Washington, DC.
Following her service in the Army,
Marcella worked for the Indian Health
Service—IHS—in Eagle Butte for 31
years. She would eventually become
the Eagle Butte IHS Hospital’s director
of nursing. In addition to her work at
the IHS Hospital, she served 4 years on
the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Coun-
cil while raising eight children with
her husband, Gilbert.
After retiring from the IHS, Marcella
opened a quilting shop with her grand-
daughter. They make a variety of
quilts, with the main feature being the
star quilt used by the Lakota people
for honoring and naming ceremonies,
memorials, and various life achieve-
ments.
In 2016, Marcella was inducted into
the South Dakota Hall of Fame, and
she received the Women in History
award from the Spirit of the Prairie
Chapter of the Daughters of the Amer-
ican Revolution. She also received an
honorary doctorate of public service
from South Dakota State University in
2018.
With her lifesaving work in the Army
and a longtime commitment to South
Dakota, Marcella has made a lasting
impression on the lives of many, and
on behalf of all of them, I would I like
to wish her a happy birthday and thank
her for her remarkable service to the
United States.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ADA S.
MCKINLEY COMMUNITY SERVICES
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as World
War I came to a close in 1919, Ada So-
phia McKinley founded a Chicago
South Side settlement house for re-
turning war veterans and anyone else
in need of training, food, shelter, and
recreation. As century later, the Ada
S. McKinley Community Services
serves more than 7,000 people annually
at 70 locations in Illinois, Indiana, and
Wisconsin.
McKinley was born 3 years after the
Civil War in Galveston, TX. During
World War I, she moved to Chicago
with her husband and son. She was a
schoolteacher and a community activ-
ist. McKinley began volunteering as an
official hostess of the War Camp Club
on South Wabash Avenue, helping war
servicemen and their families. The club
used recreational and civic activities
to help soldiers make the transition
back. It was a precursor to the thera-
pies we use today for posttraumatic
stress disorder treatments.
The War Recreation Board cut fund-
ing to the War Camp Club when the
war ended, but the Douglas/South Side
community still needed help, and the
Great Migration had accelerated people
moving to Chicago with very little re-
sources. McKinley continued helping
people, eventually founding what be-
came the South Side Settlement House
in an old, three-story mansion at 32nd
and Wabash Avenue in 1919.
At the South Side Settlement House,
people could get a meal, some cash, and
take classes in sewing, cooking, arts,
and crafts, ceramics, and storytelling.
There was a summer camp, a library,
and even friendship clubs for lonely
seniors.
McKinley never collected a salary for
her work. She established a board of di-
rectors, implemented childcare, job
training, employment referral, and
educational systems for all ages.
After the 1919 Chicago race riots,
McKinley marched with legendary col-
leagues Jane Addams, Harriet Vittum,
and Mary McDowell. McKinley worked
with the Chicago Commission on Race
Relations to help restore order and re-
lief to people.
On August 24, 1952, McKinley helped
lay the cornerstone for a new head-
quarters for her organization at 100 E.
34th Street. Hours later, she suffered a
cerebral hemorrhage and passed away.
Her legacy lives on in the work of her
agency. Today, children can attend
quality education services at the Ada
S. McKinley Community Services loca-
tions. People can get help for their
lives with mentoring programs, finan-
cial aid counseling, and a host of other
programs. Their motto is ‘‘Empower.
Educate. Employ.’’ Today, we honor a

CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am
pleased that the fiscal year 2020 appro-
priations bill for the Department of
State and Foreign Operations was re-
ported unanimously by the committee
earlier today. There is a great deal in
the bill that the American people can
feel good about, as the summaries re-
leased by both the majority and minor-
ity indicate. However, as is always the
case with bipartisan legislation, there
are also things that I wish were not in
the bill, and there are things missing
from the bill that I wish had been in-
cluded. I want to speak about one of
those.
I deeply regret that the bill does not
even mention the words ‘‘climate
change.’’ That is remarkable, or per-
haps a better word is ‘‘appalling,’’
when one considers the existential
threat that climate change poses for
every living thing on Earth. If Demo-
crats were in the majority, funding for
programs to combat global warming
and adapt to climate change would be a
priority in the bill. Instead, it is com-
pletely missing.
An example is the Green Climate
Fund, GCF, which was created in 2010
with the active participation of the
United States. Its mission is to respond
to climate change by investing in low-
emission and climate-resilient develop-
ment. The GCF was established to
limit or reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions in developing countries and to
help vulnerable societies adapt to the
unavoidable impacts of climate change.
The United States contributed a total
of $1 billion in the first 2 years of oper-
ation of the GCF.
Then President Trump was elected.
Even though, according to press re-
ports, the Trump Organization had pre-
viously cited climate change in its ap-
plication for a permit to build a barrier
to protect a Trump golf course from
the rising sea level and increasingly
powerful storms, he continues to pub-
licly refuse to recognize climate
change as a serious threat. Despite
that hypocrisy and overwhelming sci-
entific recognition of the impact of
burning fossil fuels on the Earth’s cli-
mate, the Trump White House with-
drew from the Paris climate agreement
and opposed further U.S. funding for
the GCF. Republican majorities in the
Congress fell into line, and in the past
two appropriations bills, there has been
no funding for a U.S. contribution to
the GCF.
The next replenishment for the GCF
is scheduled for 2020. Since there are no
funds in the bill just reported by the
Appropriations Committee for a U.S.
contribution to the GCF, absent an
about-face by the White House, the
United States will not make a replen-
ishment pledge. It will be left to other
countries to ensure that the GCF con-
tinues to operate. Once again, U.S.
leadership to address what many be-
lieve to be the most ominous threat
facing the world is nowhere to be seen.
Despite that inexcusable failure by
the White House and the Republican
leadership in Congress, it is important
to emphasize that overwhelmingly the
American people recognize the threat
that climate change poses and they
want strong action to address it. They
see what is happening here and around
the world, as extreme climatic events—
hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding,
droughts, and forest fires, coupled with
crop failures, displacement of people
whose homes and livelihoods are de-
stroyed, and unprecedented migration
flows—become more and more frequent
and destructive. They rightly fear that
if we fail to act, not long from now,
these types of disasters will be expo-
nentially worse, and they worry about
the chaos this would cause for their
children and grandchildren.
I mention this because I am con-
fident that as soon as we have a Presi-
dent who puts the lives of future gen-
erations above the profits and cam-
paign contributions of the fossil fuel
companies, the United States will once
again become a leader against climate
change and a leading contributor to
the GCF. Other countries should under-
stand this. Despite President Trump
and his cheerleaders in Congress, the
United States has not turned its back
on the threat of climate change, nor
have we abandoned the GCF. Presi-
dents come and go, and while U.S. sup-
port for diplomacy and programs to
combat climate change is currently
suspended, the American people, and
especially the younger generation, will
make sure that suspension is only tem-
porary.
f
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE
DEATH OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we
remember and remind the world that
nearly 1 year has passed since the pre-
meditated murder of Jamal Khashoggi
by the Saudi Government.
That horrific crime, carried out so
brazenly as if it were just a routine job,
exposed the true character of the Saudi
Government not only as it pertains to
Mr. Khashoggi but to the ruthless
treatment of critics of the Saudi royal
family more broadly.
While the Crown Prince systemati-
cally orders the execution of his oppo-
nents, he has so far escaped punish-
ment for the murder of Mr. Khashoggi
and for the lies about that crime.
Multiple Saudi officials, including
the Foreign Minister, Minister of Inte-
rior, and others—all members of the
royal family—flagrantly and shame-
lessly lied to the world, repeatedly
changing their story.
The Crown Prince called Khashoggi a
‘‘dangerous jihadist.’’ That too was a
lie.
The Saudis, who have refused to turn
over Mr. Khashoggi’s remains, insist
that the men who were arrested are the
only ones involved in the murder. No
one who knows anything about the
Saudi royal family, which is the Saudi
Government, believes that.
Despite all the incriminating evi-
dence and all the lies, the White House
continues to ignore its own intel-
ligence experts and the U.N. Special
Rapporteur, relying instead on the
Saudi royal family to investigate
itself. What a sham.
This crime reminds us that journal-
ists the world over who shine a spot-
light on corrupt, repressive govern-
ments risk their lives and the safety of
their families. They are threatened and
killed for nothing more than doing
their job.
Today we are also concerned about
the fate of hundreds of courageous pro-
democracy activists who have recently
been arrested for protesting against
corruption and repression in Egypt.
Journalists, members of opposition po-
litical parties, and civil society activ-
ists in Egypt are routinely persecuted,
denied due process, and subjected to
prolonged physical and psychological
abuse.
If the Saudi royal family can escape
punishment for the premeditated mur-
der of a Washington Post journalist,
what does that say to journalists ev-
erywhere? What does it say about our
own government, if we accept that?
I want to remind the Saudi Govern-
ment, the White House, and the State
Department that we do not—and we
will not—accept that. Jamal Khashoggi
was murdered, and there is no reason-
able doubt about who is culpable. Jus-
tice will be done—no matter how long
it takes.

CONFIRMATION OF GENERAL JOHN
E. HYTEN
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, earlier
today, this body confirmed Gen. John
Hyten as Vice Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. The vote was 75 to 22. It
should have been 100 to 0.
General Hyten has weathered a storm
of malicious attacks on his character—
attacks that have been elevated by
credulous pundits and politicians, even
as they have been debunked again and
again by independent investigations.
Today, General Hyten got his due,
and Joint Chiefs gained a great lead-
er—all because he refused to back down
and because a majority of this body
was willing to follow the facts where
they lead.
General Hyten has devoted his life to
public service. He attended Harvard
University on an ROTC scholarship and
spent the next three decades mastering
warfare in a new domain: space. Today,
he is an undisputed expert in space
technology and operations, having
served in senior positions at Strategic
Command, Central Command, Air
Force Space Command, and the 50th
Space Wing at Schriever Air Force
Base.
Gen. Hyten’s expertise and leadership
will only grow more valuable in the

years ahead, as the United States com-
petes with China for dominance in
space and cyberspace.
Unfortunately, we haven’t spent the
past few months discussing General
Hyten’s qualifications for the job or
the strategic challenges we face as a
nation. Instead, Gen. Hyten’s nomina-
tion was marred by false accusations of
misconduct by a subordinate. This ac-
cuser has a long and disturbing history
of responding to professional setbacks
with serious accusations against her
superiors. These accusations—all of
them, against General Hyten and oth-
ers in her chain of command—have
been dismissed by competent, inde-
pendent military investigations. Mul-
tiple inspectors general have now
looked into these claims. Countless
manhours have been devoted to uncov-
ering the truth. And the truth is that
General Hyten is innocent.
Today the Senate said ‘‘enough’’ to
the malicious claims against him.
Ensuring justice for General Hyten
meant nothing more and nothing less
than following the facts where they
lead. When we follow the facts, it sends
a clear message to our men and women
in uniform that they will be treated
fairly by the armed service, not rail-
roaded by a media mob or hung out to
dry by their chain of command.
For victims of sexual assault and
harassment, following the facts will en-
sure that justice is done. It will mean
the same for victims of false claims
like General Hyten.
I know of few leaders who take sex-
ual misconduct more seriously than
my colleague, Senator MARTHA
MCSALLY—herself a victim of sexual
assault. It speaks volumes about this
case, as well as her own courage, that
Senator MCSALLY has stood up for a
good man in the face of truly reprehen-
sible attacks. I will close with her
words. ‘‘[T]he full truth was revealed in
this process,’’ she said. ‘‘The truth is
that General Hyten is innocent of these
charges.’’ Indeed he is. So today he has
been confirmed as vice chairman of the
Joint Chiefs, with our full confidence
that he will continue to serve with the
courage and brilliance that have so far
distinguished his career.

U.S. SENATE DISABLED VETERAN
LEAVE REGULATIONS
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, in ac-
cordance with rule 23 of the Rules of
Procedure of the Committee on Rules
and Administration and pursuant to
Public Law 115–364, on September 25,
2019, the Committee adopted the U.S.
Senate Disabled Veteran Leave Regula-
tions.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

U.S. SENATE DISABLED VETERAN LEAVE
REGULATIONS
ADOPTED BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES AND
ADMINISTRATION ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2019
§ 1301 Purpose and authority.
These regulations implement 5 U.S.C.
§ 6329, which establishes a leave category, to
be known as ‘‘disabled veteran leave,’’ for an
eligible employee who is a veteran with a
service-connected disability rated at 30 per-
cent or more. Such an employee is entitled
to this leave for purposes of undergoing med-
ical treatment for such disability. Disabled
veteran leave must be used during the 12-
month period beginning on the first day of
employment. The Committee’s authority to
promulgate these regulations is found in sec-
tion 1(b) of Public Law 115–364.
§ 1302 Applicability.
These regulations apply to a Senate em-
ployee who is a veteran with a service-con-
nected disability rated at 30 percent or more,
subject to the conditions specified in these
regulations. These regulations apply only to
a Senate employee who is hired on or after
November 5, 2016.
§ 1303 Definitions.
In these regulations:
‘‘12-month eligibility period’’ means the
continuous 12–month period that begins on
the first day of employment.
‘‘Agency’’ means an agency of the Federal
Government. In the case of an agency in the
Executive branch, it means an Executive
agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 105.
‘‘Employee’’ has the meaning given that
term in 5 U.S.C. § 6329(d).
‘‘Employing office’’ has the meaning given
that term in 2 U.S.C § 1301(9).
‘‘Employment’’ means service as an em-
ployee during which the employee is covered
by a leave system or leave policy under
which leave is charged for periods of absence.
This excludes service in a position in which
the employee is not covered by 5 U.S.C. § 6329
due to application of another statutory au-
thority.
‘‘First day of employment’’ means the first
day of service that qualifies as employment
that occurs on the later of—
(1) The earliest date an employee is hired
after the effective date of the employee’s
qualifying service-connected disability, as
determined by the Veterans Benefits Admin-
istration; or
(2) The effective date of the employee’s
qualifying service-connected disability, as
determined by the Veterans Benefits Admin-
istration.
‘‘Health care provider’’ has the meaning
given that term in 5 C.F.R. § 630.1202.
‘‘Hired’’ means the action of—
(1) Receiving an initial appointment to a
civilian position in the Federal Government
in which the service qualifies as employment
under these regulations or any other regula-
tions promulgated to implement 5 U.S.C.
§ 6329;
(2) Receiving a qualifying reappointment
to a civilian position in the Federal Govern-
ment in which the service qualifies as em-
ployment under these regulations or any
other regulations promulgated to implement
5 U.S.C. § 6329; or
(3) Returning to duty status in a civilian
position in the Federal Government in which
the service qualifies as employment under
these regulations or any other regulations
promulgated to implement 5 U.S.C. § 6329,
when such return immediately followed a
break in civilian duty (with the employee in
continuous civilian leave status) to perform
military service.
‘‘Medical certificate’’ means a written
statement signed by a health care provider
certifying to the treatment of a veteran’s
qualifying service-connected disability.
‘‘Medical treatment’’ means any activity
carried out or prescribed by a health care
provider to treat a veteran’s qualifying serv-
ice-connected disability.
‘‘Military service’’ means ‘‘active military,
naval, or air service’’ as that term is defined
in 38 U.S.C. § 101(24).
‘‘Qualifying reappointment’’ means an ap-
pointment of a former employee of the Fed-
eral Government following a break in em-
ployment of at least 90 calendar days.
‘‘Qualifying service-connected disability’’
means a veteran’s service-connected dis-

Veteran Benefits Administration, including
a combined degree of disability of 30 percent
or more that reflects the combined effect of
multiple individual disabilities, which re-
sulted in the award of disability compensa-
tion under title 38, United States Code. A
temporary disability rating under 38 U.S.C.
§ 1156 is considered a valid rating in applying
this definition for as long as it is in effect.

the Senate and who is covered by the leave
policies of the employee’s Senate employing

‘‘Veterans Benefits Administration’’ means
the Veterans Benefits Administration of the
Department of Veterans Affairs.
§ 1304 Eligibility.
(a) A Senate employee who is a veteran
with a qualifying service-connected dis-
ability is entitled to disabled veteran leave
under these regulations, which will be avail-
able for use during the 12-month eligibility
period beginning on the first day of employ-
ment. For each employee, including a Senate
employee, there is a single first day of em-
ployment.
(b) To be eligible for disabled veteran
leave, a Senate employee must provide to
the Senate employing office documentation
from the Veterans Benefits Administration
certifying that the Senate employee has a
qualifying service-connected disability. The
documentation should be provided to the
Senate employing office—
(1) Upon the first day of employment, if
the Senate employee has already received
such certifying documentation; or
(2) For a Senate employee who has not yet
received such certifying documentation from
the Veterans Benefit Administration, as
soon as practicable after the Senate em-
ployee receives the certifying documenta-
tion.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this
section, a Senate employee may submit cer-
tifying documentation at a later time, in-
cluding after a period of absence for medical
treatment, as described in § 1306(c). The 12-
month eligibility period is fixed based on the
first day of employment and is not affected
by the timing of when certifying documenta-
tion is provided.
(d) If a Senate employee’s service-con-
nected disability rating is decreased or dis-
continued during the 12-month eligibility pe-
riod such that the Senate employee no
longer has a qualifying service-connected
disability—
(1) The Senate employee must notify the
Senate employing office of the effective date
of the change in the disability rating; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5742 September 26, 2019
(2) The Senate employee is no longer eligi-
ble for disabled veteran leave as of the effec-
tive date of the rating change.
§ 1305 Crediting disabled veteran leave.
(a) Upon receipt of the certifying docu-
mentation under § 1304, a Senate employing
office must credit 104 hours of disabled vet-
eran leave to a full-time, non-temporary
Senate employee or a proportionally equiva-
lent amount for a part-time Senate em-
ployee, except as otherwise provided in this
section.
(b) The proportional equivalent of 104
hours for a full-time Senate employee is de-
termined for part-time Senate employees as
follows: the 104 hours is prorated based on
the number of hours in the part-time sched-
ule (as established for leave charging pur-
poses) relative to a full-time schedule (e.g.,
52 hours for a half-time schedule).
(c) When a Senate employee is converted
to a different schedule for leave purposes,
the Senate employee’s balance of unused dis-
abled veteran leave must be converted to the
proper number of hours based on the propor-
tion of hours in the new schedule compared
to the former schedule. For short—term or
temporary employees, hours must be
annualized in determining the proportion.
(d)(1) A Senate employee who was pre-
viously employed by an agency or employing
office whose employees were not subject to 5
U.S.C. § 6329 must certify, at the time the
Senate employee is hired by a Senate em-
ploying office, whether or not that former
agency or employing office provided entitle-
ment to an equivalent disabled veteran leave
benefit to be used in connection with the
medical treatment of a service-connected
disability rated at 30 percent or more. The
Senate employee must certify the date he or
she commenced the period of eligibility to
use disabled veteran leave in the former
agency or employing office.
(2) If 12 months have elapsed since the
commencing date referenced in paragraph
(e)(1) of this section, the Senate employee
will be considered to have received the full
amount of an equivalent benefit and no ben-
efit may be provided under these regulations.
(3) If the Senate employee is still within
the 12-month period that began on the com-
mencing date referenced in paragraph (e)(1)
of this section, the Senate employee must
certify the number of hours of disabled vet-
eran leave used at the former agency or em-
ploying office. The gaining Senate employ-
ing office must offset the number of hours of
disabled veteran leave to be credited to the
Senate employee by the number of such
hours used by the Senate employee at the
former agency or employing office, while
making no offset under paragraph (d) of this
section. If the Senate employee had a dif-
ferent type of work schedule at the former
agency or employing office, the hours used
at the former agency or employing office
must be converted before applying the offset,
consistent with § 1305(c).
§ 1306 Requesting and using disabled veteran
leave.
(a) A Senate employee may use disabled
veteran leave only for the medical treatment
of a qualifying service-connected disability.
The medical treatment may include a period
of rest, but only if such period of rest is spe-
cifically ordered by the health care provider
as part of a prescribed course of treatment
for the qualifying service-connected dis-
ability.
(b)(1) A Senate employee must submit a re-
quest—written, oral, or electronic, as re-
quired by the Senate employing office—to
use disabled veteran leave. The request must
include a personal self-certification by the
Senate employee that the requested leave
will be (or was) used for purposes of being
furnished medical treatment for a qualifying
service-connected disability. The request
must also include the specific days and hours
of absence required for the treatment. The
request must be submitted within such time
limits as the Senate employing office may
require.
(2) A Senate employee must submit the re-
quest for approval to use disabled veteran
leave in advance of the need for leave unless
the need for leave is critical and not foresee-
able—e.g., due to a medical emergency or the
unexpected availability of an appointment
for surgery or other critical treatment. The
Senate employee must provide notice within
a reasonable period of time appropriate to
the circumstances involved. If the Senate
employing office determines that the need
for leave is critical and not foreseeable and
that the Senate employee is unable to pro-
vide advance notice of the need for leave, the
leave may not be delayed or denied.
(c)(1) When a Senate employee did not pro-
vide the Senate employing office with cer-
tification of a qualifying service-connected
disability before having a period of absence
for treatment of such disability, the Senate
employee is entitled to substitute approved
disabled veteran leave retroactively for such
period of absence (excluding periods of sus-
pension, but including leave at Senate min-
imum pay, sick leave, annual leave, compen-
satory time off, or other paid time off) in the
12-month eligibility period. Such retroactive
substitution cancels the use of the original
leave or paid time off and requires appro-
priate adjustments. In the case of retro-
active substitution for a period when a Sen-
ate employee used advanced annual leave or
advanced sick leave, the adjustment is a liq-
uidation of the leave indebtedness covered
by the substitution.
(2) A Senate employing office may require
a Senate employee to submit the medical
certification described in § 1307(a) before ap-
proving such retroactive substitution.
§ 1307 Medical certification.
(a) In addition to the Senate employee’s
self-certification required under § 1306(b)(1), a
Senate employing office may additionally re-
quire that the use of disabled veteran leave
be supported by a signed written medical
certification issued by a health care pro-
vider.
(b) When a Senate employing office re-
quires a signed written medical certification
by a health care provider, the Senate em-
ploying office may specify that the certifi-
cation include—
(1) A statement by the health care provider
that the medical treatment is for one or
more service-connected disabilities of the
Senate employee that resulted in 30 percent
or more disability rating;
(2) The date or dates of treatment or, if the
treatment extends over several days, the be-
ginning and ending dates of the treatment;
(3) If the leave was not requested in ad-
vance, a statement that the treatment re-
quired was of an urgent nature or there were
other circumstances that made advanced
scheduling not possible; and
(4) Any additional information that is es-
sential to verify the Senate employee’s eligi-
bility.
(c)(1) A Senate employee must provide any
required written medical certification no
later than 15 calendar days after the date the
Senate employing office requests such med-
ical certification, except as otherwise al-
lowed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2) If the Senate employing office deter-
mines it is not practicable under the par-
ticular circumstances for the Senate em-
ployee to provide the requested medical cer-
tification within 15 calendar days after the
date requested by the Senate employing of-
fice despite the Senate employee’s diligent,
good faith efforts, the Senate employee must
provide the medical certification within a
reasonable period of time under the cir-
cumstances involved, but in no case later
than 60 calendar days after the date the Sen-
ate employing office requests such docu-
mentation.
(3) A Senate employee who does not pro-
vide the required evidence or medical certifi-
cation within the specified time period is not
entitled to use disabled veteran leave, and
the Senate employing office may, as appro-
priate and consistent with applicable laws
and regulations, elect to either—
(i) Charge the absence against available
forms of paid time off, such as sick leave or
annual leave, or reduce the Senate employ-
ee’s salary to an amount not less than the
Senate minimum annual rate of pay for the
period of absence; or
(ii) Allow the Senate employee to request
that the absence be charged against the Sen-
ate employee’s sick leave, annual leave, or
other available forms of paid time off.
§ 1308 Disabled veteran leave forfeiture,
transfer, reinstatement.
(a) Disabled veteran leave not used during
the 12-month eligibility period may not be
carried over to subsequent years and must be
forfeited.
(b) If a change in the Senate employee’s
disability rating during the 12-month eligi-
bility period causes the Senate employee to
no longer have a qualifying service-con-
nected disability (as described in § 1304(d)),
any unused disabled veteran leave to the
Senate employee’s credit as of the effective
date of the rating change must be forfeited.
(c) When a Senate employee with a posi-
tive disabled veteran leave balance transfers
from the payroll of one Senate employing of-
fice to the payroll of another Senate employ-
ing office during the 12-month eligibility pe-
riod, the Senate employing office from which
the Senate employee departs must certify
the number of unused disabled veteran leave
hours available for credit by the gaining
Senate employing office. The losing Senate
employing office must also certify the expi-
ration date of the Senate employee’s 12-
month eligibility period to the gaining Sen-
ate employing office. Any unused disabled
veteran leave will be forfeited at the end of
that eligibility period. For the purpose of
this paragraph, the term ‘‘transfers’’ shall
have such meaning as is ascribed to it by the
Secretary of the Senate.
(d)(1) A Senate employee with a balance of
unused disabled veteran leave who ceases
employment with a Senate employing office
during the employee’s 12-month eligibility
period, and later recommences employment
covered by 5 U.S.C. § 6329 with a Senate em-
ploying office within that same eligibility
period, is entitled to a recredit of the unused
balance.
(2) When a Senate employee has a break in
employment as described in paragraph (d)(1)
of this section, the losing Senate employing
office must certify the number of unused dis-
abled veteran leave hours available for re-
credit by the gaining Senate employing of-
fice. The losing Senate employing office
must also certify the expiration date of the
employee’s 12-month eligibility period. Any
unused disabled veteran leave must be for-
feited at the end of that eligibility period.
(3) In the absence of the certification de-
scribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section,
the recredit of disabled veteran leave may
also be supported by written documentation
available to the gaining Senate employing
office in its official personnel records con-
cerning the employee, copies of contempora-
neous earnings and leave statement(s) pro-
vided by the Senate employee, or copies of
other contemporaneous written documenta-
tion acceptable to the gaining Senate em-
ploying office.

BUDGET ENFORCEMENT LEVELS
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 3005
of H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress, the
Concurrent Resolution on the Budget
for Fiscal Year 2018, allows the chair-
man of the Senate Budget Committee
to revise the allocations, aggregates
and levels in the budget resolution for
legislation related to the extension of
certain healthcare policies. This ad-
justment authority, which was updated
by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, is
contingent on the legislation not in-
creasing the deficit over either the pe-
riod of fiscal years 2020–2024 or the pe-
riod of fiscal years 2020–2029.
I find that H.R. 4378, the Continuing
Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health
Extenders Act of 2019, meets the condi-
tions of deficit neutrality found in sec-
tion 3005 of H. Con. Res 71. This deter-
mination has been made by looking at
the deficit effects of the revenue and
direct spending provisions of both Divi-
sion A and Division B of H.R. 4378. Ac-
cordingly, I am revising the allocations
to the Committee on Finance and the
budgetary aggregates to account for
the direct spending and revenue effects
of the bill. Further, I am temporarily
adjusting the Senate’s PAYGO score-
card to reflect the $667 million deficit
increase in Fiscal Year 2020 and deficit
decreases of $477 million and $1 million
over the 5- and 10-year periods, respec-
tively. In recognition of the instruc-
tion to exclude the budgetary effects of
division B from the PAYGO scorecard
in title VII, the table accompanying
this statement reflects only the pro-
rated revenue effects of division A,
which are not covered by the exception
and whose adjustments will remain for
PAYGO scorecard purposes.
Section 124 of division A provides for
additional budgetary resources for the
Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative
and designates those resources as being
for overseas contingency operations/
global war on terrorism, OCO, pursuant
to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit
Control Act of 1985, as amended. This
designation makes this spending qual-
ify for a discretionary cap adjustment
under current statute. This provision
has no effect on budget authority but
would increase outlays by $128 million
in Fiscal Year 2020. Therefore, I am re-
vising the allocation to the Committee
on Appropriations and further modi-
fying the spending aggregate for Fiscal
Year 2020 to accommodate these out-
lays.
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed
in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

REMEMBERING MARY GAUTREAUX
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, it is
with a heavy heart today that I honor
the incredible life of Mary Gautreaux,
an Oregonian who never stopped fight-
ing to make our State and our world a
better place for all. Throughout her
decades-long career working with my
colleague Senator WYDEN as a fellow, a
field representative, and as deputy
State director, she was deeply com-
mitted to not only preserving Oregon’s
natural treasures but making sure Or-
egonians in every comer of our State
had the opportunity to experience
them.
Her love for helping others was only
paralleled by her passion for Oregon’s
incredible public lands, which was a
cornerstone of her life even long before
she joined Senator WYDEN’s team. Pre-
viously, she fought wildfires and main-
tained our forests—strenuous, coura-
geous work that is critical to keeping
our communities safe. When she
transitioned to Senator WYDEN’s office,
her hard work continued and cul-
minated in countless accomplishments
that will shape the lives of Oregonians
for generations to come.
On behalf of all Oregonians, I thank
her for her generous spirit and her un-
wavering dedication to serving the peo-
ple of Oregon. Her contributions will be
felt for generations to come, and she
will be dearly missed and never forgot-
ten.

TRIBUTE TO CHRIS GASPAR
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President,
today I wish to bid a fond farewell and
recognize the excellent service of my
longtime foreign affairs and defense
policy adviser, Christopher Gaspar.
Over the past 6 years, Chris has
brought expertise, insight, and sage ad-
vice across a wide range of defense pol-
icy, defense appropriations, and foreign
affairs matters that have benefited me
directly and, through his service, the
Nation.
I have valued Chris’s counsel on con-
tentious issues to include Iran’s nu-
clear program and the Joint Com-
prehensive Plan of Action to address it;
the Israel-Palestinian conflict; U.S.-
China relations; human rights issues in
Saudi Arabia, Burma, and Tibet; na-
tional security space launch; deterio-
rating conditions in Central American
countries; oversight of the U.S. nuclear
arsenal; and U.S. counterterrorism ef-
forts across the globe.
The people of California largely don’t
know his name, but have benefited
from his dedicated work on numerous
National Defense Authorization Acts
and Defense Appropriations Acts. He
has helped enact numerous provisions
into law for the betterment of the
State, including securing seven C–130
tankers for California to fight
wildfires, making California’s the larg-
est wildfire aerial fleet in the country.
He has worked with our counties and
cities to allow underutilized National
Guard facilities to be used to combat
California’s homelessness crisis. This
year, he led a comprehensive effort to
investigate and draft reforms to ad-
dress shameful, substandard contract
military housing to meet the needs of
our servicemembers and their families
a provision that I hope will soon be en-
acted in this year’s defense bill.
Chris has been by my side for numer-
ous sensitive meetings with foreign
leaders, ambassadors, military com-
manders, corporate chiefs, and local of-
ficials, and he has always exhibited a
level of professionalism, dedication,
and empathy that I deeply admire and
appreciate.
He has also helped California con-
stituents facing issues abroad, served
as a valued mentor to junior staff,
dedicated himself to liaison relation-
ships with the House of Representa-
tives on coffee meetings, proven him-
self to be an integral member of my ap-
propriations team, and was always
ready with a quip—sometimes humor-
ous—to help lighten the mood.
Chris is moving on to the private sec-
tor——hopefully temporarily—and will
spend some much deserved down-time
with his new wife. I wish him all the
best in his future endeavors, and my
staff and I will deeply miss him.
Thank you

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO CRAIG BECKER
∑ Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
today I wish to recognize Craig Becker,
who, after 42 years in the health care
system, including 26 years leading the
Tennessee Hospital Association, is re-
tiring this month. Considering how the
health care system has changed in
those four decades, I can imagine Craig
has many stories he could tell of what
can happen when people seek to help
others as our healthcare professionals
do.
For those of us from Tennessee, we know
Craig is an advocate for hospitals, providing
an articulate explanation on issues ranging
from Medicare hospital wage disparities to
leveling the playing field for Tennessee on
Medicaid disproportionate share hospital
payment issues, to seeking solutions for
rural communities in maintaining a medical
presence.
Craig’s dedication has never been about
just his job or solely about his service to
those working in health care. Several years
ago, when was asked in an interview, ‘‘what
has been your worst decision,’’ he answered,
‘‘dropping out of the Boy Scouts before ob-
taining his Eagle rank.’’ Craig has more than
made up for that—for 25 years, he has served
as the Assistant Scout Master of Troup 1 in
Brentwood Tennessee. Craig has spent dozens
of weekends through those two and a half
decades hiking and camping with the Boy
Scouts of central Tennessee including camp-
ing in both Tennessee State and our nation’s
National Parks. He has participated in jam-
borees as far away as the World Jamboree in
Chile several years ago. Among his many
awards, he is a ’Life Scout’ which is a badge
given for those who can help point Scouts
the right way in life ‘‘as truly as does a com-
pass in the field.’’
I was a Boy Scout, and know the lessons
one can learn about the great American out-
doors, serving your community, and lifelong
friendships. It makes sense to me that some-
one so involved in scouting, has dedicated
his professional life to improving Tennessee
and our nation’s healthcare system.
While Craig may be retiring from his day
job with THA, we are thankful he plans to
continue to serve the Boy Scouts and his
community.
I congratulate Craig on a lifetime of serv-
ice, and wish all the best in retirement to
him, his wife Angie—a retired nurse practi-
tioner—and their two sons.∑

TRIBUTE TO ‘‘MISS ROXIE’’

∑ Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President,
today I wish to acknowledge the well-
deserved retirement of Nashville, Ten-
nessee’s own Roxie Gibson.
Roxie, or, ‘‘Miss Roxie,’’ as we all

REMEMBERING MILO J. SHULT
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor the life and legacy of
Dr. Milo J. Shult, whose steady hand
led the University of Arkansas Sys-
tem’s Division of Agriculture for 18
years. Milo passed away on July 19,
2019.
Dr. Milo Shult was originally from
Keokuk, IA, and after graduating with
his Ph.d. from Iowa State University,
started his career in agriculture for the
Texas A&M University System. In 1992,
he became the University of Arkansas
System’s vice president for agriculture,
a position he held for 18 years.
Throughout his tenure, Milo trans-
formed the Division of Agriculture to
enhance its research and extension ca-
pabilities to become one of the finest
in the Nation.
Throughout his 38-year career in pub-
lic agricultural research and extension,
Milo was a dedicated advocate for agri-
culture. He served on several local,
State and national committees, includ-
ing the Council for Agricultural Re-
search, Extension and Teaching,
CARET; Arkansas Agriculture Board;
as chairman of the board for the Na-
tional Agricultural Research, Exten-
sion, Education and Economics,
NAREEE; and chair of the Winthrop
Rockefeller Institute. In 2011, Milo was
inducted into the Arkansas Agriculture
Hall of Fame.
The impact of his career and leader-
ship are once again being acknowl-
edged as the division is commemo-
rating Milo’s years of service by re-
naming the Arkansas Agricultural Re-
search & Extension Center in his
honor. Starting on its 100th anniver-
sary, ‘‘The Farm,’’ as it is known in
Fayetteville, will now be called the
Milo J. Shult Agricultural Research &
Extension Center.
Milo Shult left a mark on the Univer-
sity of Arkansas System and our
State’s agriculture community that no
one will soon forget. I am proud that
this is one more piece of Milo’s legacy
that will live on at the Division of Ag-
riculture, and I hope that future lead-
ers will follow his remarkable exam-
ple.∑
f
RECOGNIZING WIMMER’S
DIAMONDS
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I rise
today to recognize the legacy of
Wimmer’s Diamonds, which this month
is celebrating a century of doing busi-
ness in Fargo.
Throughout these years, this fourth-
generation jewelry store has been a
mainstay in downtown Fargo. It has
grown along with the city, adding a
second location at West Acres Mall in
1985.
The business began as the Fargo Jew-
elry Manufacturing Company, founded
by Fred Wimmer, a Hungarian immi-
grant who arrived in New York City in
1907. He began working in America at
Tiffany & Co. as an engraver. He moved
West 3 years later, continuing his work
in Minneapolis and Owatonna, Min-
nesota, for 6 more years before arriving
in Fargo in 1919.
In the years since, the Wimmer fam-
ily has designed, sold, and serviced dia-
monds to customers throughout the re-
gion. The responsibility for keeping the
business going has been passed on from
Fred to his son, Art, then to grandson
Andy, and on to the current generation
of owners, Brad Wimmer and his son,
Aaron.
Likewise, Wimmer’s Diamonds has
been a destination for generations of
customers, who have looked to it as a
trusted partner when occasions call for
a gift of diamonds and fine jewelry.
In a time when there are fewer fam-
ily-owned businesses, Wimmer’s has
been successful by adapting to the
changes of retail management and cus-
tomer preferences. It has been long es-
tablished as a valued member of the
community, giving back over the years
in every way possible.
I congratulate the entire Wimmer
family for a century of business in
Fargo. Wimmer’s Diamonds is testa-
ment to the importance of small busi-
nesses in communities of all sizes
across the Nation and the impact en-
trepreneurs have on our American
economy.
You have enhanced the quality of life
we treasure in North Dakota and have
set a very high bar for being a dedi-
cated community partner. Thank you
for all you have done to enhance the
happy occasions in the lives of your
customers, and I hope you will remain
part of our celebrations for many years
to come.∑

RECOGNIZING THE HARDIN
MARCHING BAND
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
the Hardin High School Marching Band
for being selected to represent Mon-
tana at the 2020 Independence Day Pa-
rade in Washington, DC.
Countless hours of practice, dedica-
tion, and hard work earned these young
musicians this prestigious honor, and I
am proud they are representing the
Treasure State on the national stage.
While making their way to Wash-
ington, DC, these students will have
the opportunity to travel on a 10-day
journey across the country before
reaching the Nation’s Capital. They
will get to experience some of Amer-
ica’s national attractions like Mount
Rushmore, Wrigley Stadium, and the
National Football Hall of Fame. The
memories these young leaders will
make on this trip will last them a life-
time.
It is my honor to recognize the Har-
din High School Marching Band. Their
talent and musical ability is a testa-
ment to the quality of the music edu-
cation programs we have in Big Sky
Country. I know that they will make
all of Montana proud.∑
f
REMEMBERING BOB ANDERSON
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President,
today, along with Senator TINA SMITH
of Minnesota, I rise to acknowledge the
passing of a longtime advocate, mayor,
and friend, International Falls Mayor
Bob Anderson, who died unexpectedly
on September 20, 2019. Described by
those who knew him as the ‘‘voice and
face of International Falls,’’ Bob spent
five decades in public service to the
hometown and community he loved.
A lifelong resident of International
Falls and graduate of Rainy River
Community College, Bob spent 51 years
working for the local Boise paper mill,
including 25 as the public affairs man-
ager for the Boise Cascade Corporation.
Bob was passionate about his com-
munity, and his love was reflected in
his years of dedication to the airport,
hospital, Highway 53 Task Force, the
county, anything and everything con-
nected to his beloved International
Falls. He truly left his mark on his be-
loved hometown from his seats on the
city council, the chamber of commerce,
and as its devoted mayor—serving first
from 1968 to 1986 and then elected again
in 2013. And he still wasn’t done; he had
made clear that he was fully intending
to seek another term next year.
Bob was also dedicated to improving
communities across Minnesota through
decades of service on numerous state-
wide committees and advocacy organi-
zations, including as a president of the
League of Minnesota Cities, as a mem-
ber of the Minnesota Forestry Associa-
tion, and as chairman of our Lessard-
Sams Outdoor Heritage Council.
He also chaired the International
Falls-Koochiching County Airport
Commission for over 30 years, helping
to secure Federal grant money for the
airport that serves as a major corridor
between the ‘‘icebox of the Nation’’ and
those who flock to the area to hunt,
fish, and enjoy the beauty of northern
Minnesota. Earlier this year and in
large part due to Bob’s efforts, the
International Falls Airport opened a
brand new terminal.
The airport was just one of the many
legacies Bob leaves behind. In the
words of Representative Rob Ecklund
of International Falls, ‘‘You can’t go
anywhere in northern Minnesota with-
out seeing his fingerprint on it, from
airports to roads. He left a tremendous
lasting imprint.’’
We are thankful we were able to
work with Bob on so many of these
projects—from economic development
initiatives to youth programs—and will

always remember him as a tireless
champion for small towns and the out-
doors.
In his final state of the city address,
delivered just weeks ago, Bob summed
up progress in his community, saying
‘‘There is a lot of sunshine and a few
dark clouds, but overall it’s positive.’’
We hope during this time of loss for
both our State and Bob’s family, his
wife Carol, three children, and five
grandchildren will take solace in re-
membering all the sunshine Bob
blessed us with.∑

TRIBUTE TO DR. JASPER LICALZI
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, today I
rise to recognize an Idaho educator
who has committed himself with dis-
tinction to mentoring some of my
State’s brightest students. Since 1993,
Dr. Jasper LiCalzi has been a member
of the College of Idaho faculty, most
recently as the chair of the Depart-
ment of Political Economy. There he
offers courses on national government
institutions, State and local politics,
and public policy issues such as
healthcare, the environment, and mac-
roeconomics.
Dr. LiCalzi’s research at the College
of Idaho has concentrated on interest
groups in Idaho and the Idaho State
Legislature. He recently completed a
book, ‘‘Idaho Politics and Government:
Culture Clash and Conflicting Values
in the Gem State’’. The book examines
governmental and political institu-
tions in Idaho through the prism of po-
litical culture.
Dr. LiCalzi is also the political ana-
lyst for KIVI Channel Six in Boise, ID,
and is frequently featured as an expert
on political economy by radio and
newspapers both locally and nation-
ally. He is also a member of the advi-
sory board for the Idaho Center for Fis-
cal Policy.
As Governor and U.S. Senator, I have
had the pleasure of hiring many stu-
dents of Dr. LiCalzi’s as staff members,
from interns to the highest leadership
positions. His dedication and quality of
education was apparent in each and
every one of them.
After a generation of educating Ida-
ho’s brightest, he has announced his
much deserved retirement. Beyond the
classroom, Dr. LiCalzi has set the bar
for what a college mentor should be. It
is not unusual to find him outside the
classroom most nights advising stu-
dent groups, cheering for the ‘‘Yotes’’
and contributing to the community of
Caldwell, ID.
Finally, Mr. President, those of us in
this business know you cannot do it
without support and great advice, and
the best advice comes from your wife. I
would be remiss not to pay tribute
today to Dr. LiCalzi’s wife, Deborah.
At every turn, she has been standing
next to Dr. LiCalzi, many times cheer-
ing louder than he. Their decades of
marriage and commitment to each
other exceed even the high accomplish-
ments Dr. LiCalzi has made at the Col-
lege of Idaho.
The College of Idaho and the State of
Idaho have been made a better place
due to the career and commitment of
Dr. and Mrs. LiCalzi.∑

25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEW
HAMPSHIRE POLICE ASSOCIA-
TION PIPES & DRUMS
∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise
today on behalf of the New Hampshire
congressional delegation, Senator
Maggie Hassan and Representatives
Ann McLane Kuster and Chris Pappas,
to salute the New Hampshire Police
Association Pipes and Drums on its
25th anniversary. For a quarter cen-
tury, NHPA Pipes and Drums have
brought their distinct sound to memo-
rial services and community events in
the Granite State and across the coun-
try. They honor their brothers and sis-
ters in uniform with each performance.
The beginnings of NHPA Pipes and
Drums are rooted in tragedy. In Octo-
ber of 1994, Sergeant James Noyes of
the New Hampshire State Police SWAT
Team responded to a barricaded subject
in Gilford, NH. Trained in hostage ne-
gotiations, he was trying to dissuade a
clearly distraught man from harming
himself when the man suddenly opened
fire. Sergeant Noyes was struck by a
bullet under his arm and succumbed to
his injury, leaving behind a wife,
daughter, and two sons.
At his funeral days later, his fellow
troopers and law enforcement officers
listened to the Boston Police Gaelic
Column pay tribute to Sergeant Noyes.
Their bagpipes and drums gave expres-
sion to their shared grief. A few offi-
cers quickly initiated a search for any-
one interested in a New Hampshire-
based police pipes and drum band. Sev-
eral individuals from various depart-
ments answered the call, and they held
their first practice 2 months later.
After 2 years of trainings and rehears-
als, the New Hampshire Police Associa-
tion Pipes and Drums gave its maiden
performance at the New Hampshire Po-
lice Memorial in Concord.
The band’s current roster has honed a
difficult craft, and their performances
give special meaning to both somber
police memorials as well as more
cheerful community events. They are
frequent marchers in Forth of July and
holiday parades around the region.
They are mainstays at the New Hamp-
shire Highland Games. They bring
their talents to send-offs for Honor
Flights, which flies veterans to Wash-
ington, DC, at no cost to see war me-
morials. They have played at Fenway
Park, as well as in the Nation’s Capital
during National Police Week, and at
our annual Congressional Law Enforce-
ment Awards, they play a crucial role
in our efforts to honor officers who go
above and beyond the call of duty.
On behalf of the people of New Hamp-
shire, we ask our colleagues and all
Americans to join us in congratulating
NHPA Pipes and Drums on 25 years of
service and wishing its pipers and
drummers all the best in the coming
years.∑

S. 2579. A bill to direct the Director

tivities to ensure that Federal science

WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN STEM
BOOSTER ACT OF 2019
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, studies
show that women and underrepresented
minorities face substantial barriers to
completing educational opportunities
and pursuing careers in science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) fields. Congress and the Fed-
eral government should be doing more
to help women and underrepresented
minorities succeed in these areas,
which will strengthen our economy and
communities in the long-term.
For these reasons, I come to the floor
today to reintroduce the STEM Oppor-
tunities Act of 2019 and the Women and
Minorities in STEM Booster Act of
2019, two important bills that would
help to broaden participation in STEM
and strengthen our nation’s STEM
pipeline for women and minorities.
Recent trends indicate that we are
not keeping pace with training the sci-
entists and engineers we will need for
the 21st century careers of the future.
Unfortunately, women and minorities
too often ‘‘leak’’ out of the STEM pipe-
line before completing degrees in these
critical fields. In order for the United
States to remain competitive in our in-
creasingly global economy, we need to
make sure opportunities are available
for everyone because only when every-
one succeeds can we all succeed.
As members of Congress, we have a
responsibility to ensure that our coun-
try remains competitive and provides
opportunities for all Americans. We
have an important role to play in
breaking down barriers for women and
minorities in STEM and must work to
ensure that Federal government agen-
cies, Federal laboratories, institutions
of higher education, State and local
governments, industry, and nonprofit
stakeholders are working collabo-
ratively to support these efforts.
The STEM Opportunities Act rep-
resents a comprehensive approach to
improving the severe shortage and lack
of diversity in our Nation’s STEM pipe-
line by addressing factors that limit
the progression of women and minori-
ties in research environments and im-
plementing research-based practices to
improve the recruitment and retention
of faculty and students. Specifically,
the bill would provide for guidance,
data collection, and grants for women
and minorities in STEM at institutions
of higher education and at federal
science agencies to improve access and
reduce cultural and institutional bar-
riers that limit diversity in STEM re-
search and careers.
The Women and Minorities in STEM
Booster Act represents a more targeted
approach to strengthening the STEM
pipeline, by providing for training, out-
reach, mentoring, and other resources

for women and minorities in STEM.
Specifically, the bill would require the
National Science Foundation to award
competitive grants to promote activi-
ties such as online workshops, men-
toring programs, internship opportuni-
ties, outreach efforts, and other de-
signed to increase recruitment and re-
tention of women and underrepresented
minorities in STEM. It is through
these purposeful efforts that we, as a
nation, can foster a stronger, more ex-
pansive, and diverse STEM workforce
that will help us remain a competitive
force around the world.
As we work to build and maintain
our STEM workforce, it is important
for us to promote opportunities for
women and minorities that encourage
participation so that we engage our en-
tire talent pool and ensure that our na-
tion’s future economic and national se-
curity are secure.
We have made important strides to
provide opportunities for women and
minorities in our country, but more
work remains and we should continue
our efforts by considering and passing
these bills. I thank my colleagues for
joining me in reintroducing the bills,
and encourage others to join us as we
work to strengthen the STEM pipeline
for everyone in the United States.

nesses (including manufacturers, utilities,
energy service companies, and technology
firms), public-interest organizations, envi-
ronmental and conservation groups, and
State and local governments;
Whereas, since 1980, the United States has
more than doubled its energy productivity,
realizing twice the economic output per unit
of energy consumed;
Whereas about 2,325,000 individuals in the
United States are currently employed across
the energy efficiency sector, as the United
States has doubled its energy productivity
and business and industry have become more
innovative and competitive in global mar-
kets;
Whereas the Office of Energy Efficiency

Energy is the principal Federal agency re-
sponsible for renewable energy technologies
and energy efficiency efforts;
Whereas cutting energy waste saves the
consumers of the United States billions of
dollars on utility bills annually; and
Whereas energy efficiency policies, financ-
ing innovations, and public-private partner-

mittee on the Judiciary:
S. RES. 356
Whereas designating September 4, 2019, as
‘‘National Polycystic Kidney Disease Aware-
ness Day’’ will raise public awareness and
understanding of polycystic kidney disease,
one of the most prevalent genetic kidney dis-
orders, which affects approximately 500,000
people in the United States;
Whereas National Polycystic Kidney Dis-
ease Awareness Day will help to foster an
understanding of the impact polycystic kid-
ney disease has on individuals and their fam-
ilies;
Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a pro-
gressive, genetic disorder of the kidneys that
causes damage to the kidneys and the car-
diovascular, endocrine, hepatic, and gastro-
intestinal organ systems;
Whereas polycystic kidney disease affects
the health and finances of people of all ages,
and equally affects people of all ages, races,
ethnicities, and sexes;
Whereas, of the people diagnosed with
polycystic kidney disease, approximately 10
percent have no family history of the dis-
ease, with the disease developing as a spon-
taneous mutation;
Whereas there are very few treatments and
no cure for polycystic kidney disease, which
is one of the 4 leading causes of kidney fail-
ure in the United States;
Whereas 50 percent of individuals with
polycystic kidney disease experience kidney
failure at an average age of 57;
Whereas friends, loved ones, spouses, and
caregivers of individuals with polycystic kid-
ney disease can assist with the challenges
created by polycystic kidney disease, includ-
ing by helping such individuals maintain a
healthy lifestyle and make regular visits to
their health care providers;
Whereas the severity of the symptoms of
polycystic kidney disease and limited public
awareness of the disease may cause individ-
uals to forego regular visits to their physi-
cians or avoid following the health rec-
ommendations of their doctors, which ex-
perts suggest could help prevent further
complications should kidney failure occur;
Whereas people who have chronic, life-
threatening diseases like polycystic kidney
disease may experience depression;
Whereas the PKD Foundation and its more
than 50 volunteer chapters around the
United States are dedicated to—
(1) conducting research to find treatments
and a cure for polycystic kidney disease;
(2) fostering public awareness and under-
standing of polycystic kidney disease;
(3) educating individuals and their families
about the disease to improve their treatment
and care; and
(4) providing support, including by spon-
soring the annual ‘‘Walk for PKD’’ to raise
funds for polycystic kidney disease research,
education, advocacy, and awareness; and
Whereas the PKD Foundation is partnering
on September 4, 2019, with sister organiza-
tions in Canada, Australia, and other coun-
tries to increase international awareness of
polycystic kidney disease: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved, That the Senate—

Day’’;
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness
Day to raise public awareness and under-

SENATE RESOLUTION 357—CELE-
BRATING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BIRTH OF MA-
HATMA GANDHI
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr.
CRUZ, Mr. WARNER, and Mr. CORNYN)
submitted the following resolution;
which was referred to the Committee
on the Judiciary:
S. RES. 357
Whereas Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
was born on October 2, 1869, in the modern-
day state of Gujarat, India, and October 2,
2019, represents the 150th anniversary of his
birth;
Whereas, following his admission as a law-
yer to the bar in England, Mohandas Gandhi
moved to South Africa, where he experienced
state-sanctioned racial discrimination first-
hand;
Whereas that experience motivated
Mohandas Gandhi to develop and teach the
concept of ‘‘satyagraha,’’ meaning ‘‘truth-
force,’’ which involves using methods of non-
violent dissent such as civil disobedience in
the face of injustice;
Whereas Mohandas Gandhi would spend
nearly 20 years in South Africa using the
principles of satyagraha to speak out and or-
ganize against the injustices of racial seg-
regation;
Whereas, in 1919, several years after his re-
turn to India, Mohandas Gandhi called for a
campaign of satyagraha in response to Brit-
ish authorities issuing the Rowlatt Acts;
Whereas Mohandas Gandhi began a dec-
ades-long movement of nonviolent dissent to
gain self-rule for India, including campaigns
to boycott British goods and develop the eco-
nomic independence of India;
Whereas Mohandas Gandhi persisted in his
advocacy for self-rule for India despite mul-
tiple arrests;
Whereas Mohandas Gandhi advocated for
the rights of the lowest classes in India,
whom he renamed the ‘‘Harijans,’’ or ‘‘chil-
dren of God,’’ and thereby spurred reforms
that improved the legal status of those indi-
viduals;
Whereas the vision of Mohandas Gandhi for
India was of a secular and pluralistic home
for people of different religions and back-
grounds;
Whereas the followers of Mohandas Gandhi
named him ‘‘Mahatma,’’ meaning ‘‘great
soul’’ in Sanskrit;
Whereas the nonviolent dissent movement
started by Mahatma Gandhi resulted in India
gaining its independence from the British
Empire;
Whereas the principles of satyagraha in-
spired civil rights leaders and movements
around the world, including Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., in the United States;
Whereas Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said
that the philosophy of nonviolent dissent of
Mahatma Gandhi is ‘‘the only morally and
practically sound method open to oppressed
people in their struggle for freedom’’; and
Whereas the teachings and work of Ma-
hatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., continue to inspire countless people
worldwide: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) celebrates the 150th anniversary of the
birth of Mahatma Gandhi;
(2) honors the accomplishments of Ma-
hatma Gandhi and the impact of his philos-
ophy of satyagraha, including its influence
on civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., and on the civil rights movement
in the United States;
(3) recognizes that the principles of non-
violent dissent in the face of injustice re-
main relevant and necessary today; and
(4) continues to champion the principles of
peaceful protest and nonviolent dissent ad-
vanced by Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr.

SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLU-
TION 26—CALLING FOR AN END
TO THE CONSUMPTION AND
TRADE OF DOG AND CAT MEAT
Mr. MERKLEY submitted the fol-
lowing concurrent resolution; which
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations:
S. CON. RES. 26
Whereas a bipartisan domestic prohibition
on the consumption or trade of dog and cat
meat was included in section 12515 of the Ag-
riculture Improvement Act of 2018 (7 U.S.C.
2160), which was signed into law by the Presi-
dent on December 20, 2018;
Whereas the consumption of dog meat has
occurred throughout the world, primarily in
Asia;
Whereas established markets for dog meat
still exist as of September 2019;
Whereas Humane Society International,
Animals Asia Foundation, and others esti-
mate that 30,000,000 dogs and 10,000,000 cats

S5758 September 26, 2019
die annually worldwide as a result of the dog
and cat meat trade;
Whereas, due to a traditional belief that
high adrenaline levels produce tender meat
and increase supposed health benefits, dogs
killed for their meat may be intentionally
subjected to extreme fear and suffering
through hanging and bludgeoning;
Whereas there have been reports that dogs
and cats farmed for their meat experience
abuse, poor living conditions, and cruel
slaughtering techniques;
Whereas, during transport to slaughter-
houses, many dogs and cats die or suffer ill-
ness or injury as a result of being crammed
into small cages on the back of vehicles for
days or weeks without food or water;
Whereas the extreme suffering of dogs and
cats at slaughterhouses and on transpor-
tation trucks would breach anti-cruelty laws
in the United States, such as—
(1) the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et
seq.); and
(2) Public Law 85–765 (commonly known as
the ‘‘Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of
1958’’) (7 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.);
Whereas many government officials, civil
society advocates, and activists are working
to end the trade of dog and cat meat on anti-
cruelty and public health grounds, and the
governments of Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong
Kong have passed laws banning the slaughter
of dogs for meat consumption;
Whereas the World Health Organization
has linked the dog meat industry to out-
breaks of trichinellosis, cholera, and rabies
among humans;
Whereas the people involved in the dog
meat industry are at an increased health
risk for zoonotic diseases, such as rabies,
which can transfer from dogs to humans
through infectious material such as saliva;
Whereas the spread of disease in the dog
meat industry may be exacerbated by the
unsanitary conditions of slaughter and the
sale of dog meat at open-air markets and res-
taurants; and
Whereas the World Health Organization
and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control
have acknowledged the link between the
spread of rabies and the dog meat trade,
which involves the movement of large num-
bers of dogs of unknown disease status
across vast distances: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress—
(1) calls for an end to the consumption and
trade of dog and cat meat on anti-cruelty
and public health grounds;
(2) urges all nations with a dog or cat meat
trade to adopt and enforce laws banning the
consumption and trade of dog and cat meat;
and
(3) affirms the commitment of the United
States to advancing the causes of animal
protection and animal welfare domestically
and around the world.

RELATING TO A NATIONAL EMER-
GENCY DECLARED BY THE
PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 15,
2019
On Wednesday, September 25, 2019,
the Senate passed S.J. Res. 54, as fol-
lows:
S.J. RES. 54
Whereas Congress has the sole power to de-
clare war under article I, section 8, clause 11
of the United States Constitution;
Whereas Congress has not declared war
with respect to, or provided a specific statu-
tory authorization for, the conflict between
military forces led by Saudi Arabia, includ-
ing forces from the United Arab Emirates,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco,
Senegal, and Sudan (the Saudi-led coalition),
against the Houthis, also known as Ansar
Allah, in the Republic of Yemen;
Whereas, since March 2015, members of the
United States Armed Forces have been intro-
duced into hostilities between the Saudi-led
coalition and the Houthis, including pro-
viding to the Saudi-led coalition aerial tar-
geting assistance, intelligence sharing, and
mid-flight aerial refueling;
Whereas the United States has established
a Joint Combined Planning Cell with Saudi
Arabia, in which members of the United
States Armed Forces assist in aerial tar-
geting and help to coordinate military and
intelligence activities;
Whereas, in December 2017, Secretary of
Defense James N. Mattis stated, ‘‘We have
gone in to be very—to be helpful where we
can in identifying how you do target anal-
ysis and how you make certain you hit the
right thing.’’;
Whereas the conflict between the Saudi-led
coalition and the Houthis constitutes, within
the meaning of section 4(a) of the War Pow-
ers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)), either hos-
tilities or a situation where imminent in-
volvement in hostilities is clearly indicated
by the circumstances into which United
States Armed Forces have been introduced;
Whereas section 5(c) of the War Powers
Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states that ‘‘at
any time that United States Armed Forces
are engaged in hostilities outside the terri-
tory of the United States, its possessions and
territories without a declaration of war or
specific statutory authorization, such forces
shall be removed by the President if the Con-
gress so directs’’;
Whereas section 8(c) of the War Powers
Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1547(c)) defines the in-
troduction of United States Armed Forces to
include ‘‘the assignment of members of such
armed forces to command, coordinate, par-
ticipate in the movement of, or accompany
the regular or irregular military forces of
any foreign country or government when
such military forces are engaged, or there
exists an imminent threat that such forces
will become engaged, in hostilities,’’ and ac-
tivities that the United States is conducting
in support of the Saudi-led coalition, includ-
ing aerial refueling and targeting assistance,
fall within this definition;
Whereas section 1013 of the Department of
State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984
and 1985 (50 U.S.C. 1546a) provides that any
joint resolution or bill to require the re-
moval of United States Armed Forces en-
gaged in hostilities without a declaration of
war or specific statutory authorization shall
be considered in accordance with the expe-
dited procedures of section 601(b) of the
International Security and Arms Export
Control Act of 1976 (Public Law 94–329; 90
Stat. 765); and
Whereas no specific statutory authoriza-
tion for the use of United States Armed
Forces with respect to the conflict between
the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis in
Yemen has been enacted, and no provision of
law explicitly authorizes the provision of
targeting assistance or of midair refueling
services to warplanes of Saudi Arabia or the
United Arab Emirates that are engaged in
such conflict: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. REMOVAL OF UNITED STATES ARMED
FORCES FROM HOSTILITIES IN THE
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN THAT HAVE
NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED BY CON-
GRESS.
Pursuant to section 1013 of the Department
of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984
and 1985 (50 U.S.C. 1546a) and in accordance
with the provisions of section 601(b) of the
International Security Assistance and Arms
Export Control Act of 1976 (Public Law 94–
329; 90 Stat. 765), Congress hereby directs the
President to remove United States Armed
Forces from hostilities in or affecting the
Republic of Yemen, except United States
Armed Forces engaged in operations directed
at al Qaeda or associated forces, by not later
than the date that is 30 days after the date
of the adoption of this joint resolution (un-
less the President requests and Congress au-
thorizes a later date), and unless and until a
declaration of war or specific authorization
for such use of United States Armed Forces
has been enacted. For purposes of this reso-
lution, in this section, the term ‘‘hostilities’’
includes in-flight refueling of non-United
States aircraft conducting missions as part
of the ongoing civil war in Yemen.
SEC. 2. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REGARDING
CONTINUED MILITARY OPERATIONS
AND COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL.
Nothing in this joint resolution shall be
construed to influence or disrupt any mili-
tary operations and cooperation with Israel.
SEC. 3. REPORT ON RISKS POSED BY CEASING
SAUDI ARABIA SUPPORT OPER-
ATIONS.
Not later than 90 days after the date of the
enactment of this joint resolution, the Presi-
dent shall submit to Congress a report as-
sessing the risks posed to United States citi-
zens and the civilian population of the King-
dom of Saudi Arabia and the risk of regional
humanitarian crises if the United States
were to cease support operations with re-
spect to the conflict between the Saudi-led
coalition and the Houthis in Yemen.
SEC. 4. REPORT ON INCREASED RISK OF TER-
RORIST ATTACKS TO UNITED
STATES FORCES ABROAD, ALLIES,
AND THE CONTINENTAL UNITED
STATES IF SAUDI ARABIA CEASES
YEMEN-RELATED INTELLIGENCE
SHARING WITH THE UNITED STATES.
Not later than 90 days after the date of the
enactment of this joint resolution, the Presi-
dent shall submit to Congress a report as-
sessing the increased risk of terrorist at-
tacks on United States Armed Forces
abroad, allies, and to the continental United
States if the Government of Saudi Arabia
were to cease Yemen-related intelligence
sharing with the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1209
September 26, 2019
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 125TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE GREATER
WILKES-BARRE LABOR COUNCIL
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Greater Wilkes-Barre
Labor Council on its 125th Anniversary. Since
1894, the Labor Council has been a force of
good in the Wyoming Valley, championing the
rights and interests of workers in the area.
The milestone will be celebrated along with
the 120th anniversary of the Northeastern
Pennsylvania Building and Construction
Trades Council at a special event on Satur-
day, September 28, 2019.
In the early evening of September 28, 1894,
John Casey and Daniel Shovlin of the Plumb-
ers and Steamfitters Union, Pat O’Neil and
John Gibbon of the Stone Cutters Union,
Amos Ayers of the Carpenters Union, and
David Grover of the Painters Union met in a
stone-cutting yard on South Main Street in
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania before seeking
shelter from the rain under the South Street
Bridge. These visionary men discussed form-
ing a central labor union to unite laborers from
across the city to fight for fair wages, safe
working conditions, and equitable treatment
from their employers. It was under that bridge
that the Wilkes-Barre Central Labor Union was
born.
By 1899, 118 local unions counted them-
selves as members of the Wilkes-Barre Cen-
tral Labor Union, and as many as 300 dele-
gates regularly attended meetings. To accom-
modate their ever-growing membership, John
Casey (who would go on to represent the re-
gion in the U.S. House as a pro-labor legis-
lator) and John Mullery created the Building
Trades Council as a subcommittee of the Cen-
tral Labor Union. The Union supported historic
movements such as the 1900 and the 1902
anthracite strikes where they assisted John
Marshall in organizing the United Mine Work-
ers of America. Throughout the 20th Century,
the Council supported movements large and
small in the region to reflect the best interests
of workers across a variety of industries. In
the mid-1950s, the Wilkes-Barre Central Labor
Union became officially known as the Labor
Council.
Today, the Labor Council operates out of a
former church in Wilkes-Barre. There are 47
locals affiliated with the Greater Wilkes-Barre
Labor Council, representing both private and
public sector occupations. The Council holds
an annual Labor Day festival in Kirby Park and
continues to support community-wide chari-
table campaigns.
It is an honor to recognize the Greater
Wilkes-Barre Labor Council on its 125th Anni-
versary. Its hard work and dedication to pro-
tecting the rights of workers in Northeastern
Pennsylvania has been remarkable. I wish its
leaders and members the best as they con-
tinue to advocate on behalf of our workers for
years to come.

RECOGNIZING KATHLEEN G. OTT
HON. RODNEY DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to thank Kathleen G. Ott
for her years of dedicated service to Congress
in her role as the Director of Congressional
Relations for the Library of Congress. In 2008,
Dr. James Billington, former Librarian of Con-
gress, recognized Kathy’s talents and ap-
pointed her to her esteemed position as Direc-
tor of Congressional Relations.
Kathy devoted more than a decade of her
career to building strong relationships between
the Library of Congress and Members of Con-
gress and their staffs. Throughout her tenure
with the library, she built bipartisan support
with the Committee on House Administration
for many library initiatives.
In 2009, she fostered the forming of the Li-
brary of Congress Caucus and a few years
later assisted in creating the library’s Congres-
sional Dialogue Dinner Series. Kathy has
played an integral role in developing the con-
gressional relations office at the library and
ensuring Member involvement in numerous li-
brary events.
I am grateful for her efforts to promote the
work of the library and ensure that the work of
Congress remains at the forefront of their mis-
sion.
f
HONORING KATHY OTT
HON. ZOE LOFGREN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Kathy Ott, the Director of the
Congressional Relations Office of the Library
of Congress. Kathy is retiring after serving
more than 11 years under two Librarians of
Congress, Dr. James H. Billington, and Dr.
Carla D. Hayden.
During her time at the Library, through three
Presidential administrations, seven Con-
gresses, and five chairs of the House Adminis-
tration Committee, Kathy has worked in build-
ing bipartisan support that recognizes the es-
sential contribution that the Library makes to
our national life, and to the work of Congress.
In 2009 she helped put together the Library
of Congress Caucus. In a ‘‘Dear Colleague’’
letter inviting Members to join, former Rep-
resentative Ray LaHood (R–IL) and Rep-
resentative EARL BLUMENHAUER (D–OR) wrote
that ‘‘the purpose of establishing a Library of
Congress Congressional Caucus is to draw
members’ attention to the nation’s library and
its unparalleled collections and knowledgeable
curators and to encourage further use of these
extraordinary resources.’’
Kathy was instrumental in starting the Con-
gressional Dialogue Dinner Series, which re-
cently held its 45th dinner, and has helped co-
ordinate, during her tenure, Congressional
participation in the awarding of the Library of
Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song.
I thank Kathy for her service as Director of
the Congressional Relations Office and for her
work to serve Congress and to strengthen the
relationship between the Legislative Branch
and its library.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF LIFECHOICES HEALTH
NETWORK
HON. BILLY LONG
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the LifeChoices Health Network’s
30th anniversary.
Thirty years ago, LifeChoices began as a
small neighborhood effort to help women
whose babies were at risk. Today, LifeChoices
serves women throughout southwest Missouri
and the four-state area by offering at-risk
women free education and medical services.
These services include education programs,
sexually transmitted infection testing, and early
pregnancy care that is needed to ensure that
moms and their babies are healthy.
Over the past thirty years, LifeChoices has
achieved many milestones. Over 3,800 individ-
uals have received free and confidential serv-
ices, and they have provided nearly 16,000
ultrasounds. To date, LifeChoices training pro-
grams have allowed 163 clinics to implement
STI services. Additionally, they have had near-
ly 10,000 students from area public and pri-
vate schools participate in their connection in-
stitute programs.
LifeChoices has received national and inter-
national recognition for their commitment to
helping other clinics across this nation and the
world.
Madam Speaker, the work of the
LifeChoices Health Network is vital to ensuring
at-risk women and their babies receive the
care that they need at no cost to them. I give
them my congratulations on a successful thirty
years and wish them the very best in the
many years to come.

TRIBUTE CELEBRATING THE 90TH
BIRTHDAY OF FRANK B. WASH-
INGTON
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to pay tribute to Frank B. Washington in
honor of his 90th birthday.
Frank B. Washington was born on Sep-
tember 5, 1929 in Estill, South Carolina. He
was raised in Columbia, South Carolina, in the
Waverly and Allen Benedict Court commu-
nities. Frank attended public schools in Rich-
land School District One, graduating from the
historic Booker T. Washington High School in
1945. A 1949 graduate of Allen University with
a degree in Psychology, he later pursued
graduate studies at my alma mater, South
Carolina State University as well as Catholic
University and Bradley University.
Frank began his professional career at the
South Carolina Department of Education in
1951, serving as the state’s Speech Therapist.
He served in various roles including State Su-
pervisor and Chief Supervisor of the Audit Di-
vision where he became the first African
American to hold an administrative role within
the department. Frank retired in June 1986
after an illustrious 35 years of service.
Devoted to advancing social justice, Frank
joined the Columbia Chapter of the NAACP,
and was elected President in 1970, a position
he held for sixteen years. Frank held multiple
leadership roles within the NAACP including
State Vice President for eight years and a
member of the National NAACP Board of Di-
rectors for four years. His leadership within the
NAACP was critical during the civil rights
movement and resulted in the advancement of
equal opportunity and access.
Frank was directly involved in the court de-
cisions that reapportioned the South Carolina
Legislature leading to the first three African
Americans being elected to the South Carolina
House of Representatives in 1970. Also, he
participated in the federal lawsuit that created
the 42–1 districting plan for the City Council of
Columbia, South Carolina allowing the election
of two African Americans to the City Council.
The morals and values that are the founda-
tion of his life are rooted in Frank’s faith in
God. Since 1965, he has been a member of
St. Luke’s Episcopal Church, where he has
been a member of the Vestry, and served as
Senior Warden.
Throughout his journey he has been em-
powered by the encouragement and support
of his beautiful family. Frank has been married
to the former Vivian Deloris Wingard for 69
years. They are parents of three adult chil-
dren: Carla Washington, Kent Washington,
and Robin Major. They are also proud grand-
parents of three grandsons.
Madam Speaker, Frank B. Washington has
spent his lifetime as a selfless leader and
humble servant to his fellow citizens of the
great state of South Carolina. I ask you and
my colleagues to join me in celebrating the
90th birthday of Frank B. Washington and
wishing him continued good health and great
prosperity in the days ahead.
f
HONORING HISPANIC HERITAGE
MONTH
HON. LUCY McBATH
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. Cele-
brated from September 15 to October 15, His-
panic Heritage Month is designed to celebrate
the history and culture of Americans who have
ancestors from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean,
and Central and South America. This observa-
tion was first established as Hispanic Heritage
Week under President Lyndon Johnson in
1968 and was expanded by President Ronald
Reagan in 1988 to a full monthlong celebra-
tion. Within the thirty-day period are many
celebrations of independence for Latin Amer-
ican countries. September 15 is the anniver-
sary of independence for Costa Rica, El Sal-
vador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.
Furthermore, Mexico and Chile also celebrate
their independence days on September 16
and September 18.
Whether they came here as immigrants or
their family has been here for generations,
Hispanic Americans are woven into the fabric
of this great nation. No matter when they ar-
rived, these men and women came to America
in search of a better life for themselves and
their families. Guided by the promise of free-
dom and the chance to participate in the
unique American experiment in democracy,
some of these individuals arrived with nothing
but the clothes on their back and the hope of
a better tomorrow. Motivated by their own
goals and aspirations, Hispanic Americans
have made their mark in American history,
whether it be in sports, fine arts, sciences, or
politics. Today, I am pleased to recognize their
many contributions to our country’s story.
Every day, I witness the critical role that these
men and women bring to Georgia’s Sixth Con-
gressional District. I continue to be impressed
with organizations such as the Hispanic Busi-
ness Center, Candid South, and the Latin
American Association. The hard work of these
organizations is truly making a difference in
our community and improving the lives of all
my constituents.
The Hispanic community in Georgia is vi-
brant and continues to grow significantly. Dur-
ing Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to focus
on what that means for our country. Despite
the many contributions to our society, millions
of proud immigrants have suffered discrimina-
tion at the hands of the Trump administration.
I stand alongside Hispanic Americans in re-
jecting such rhetoric and discrimination. I am
proud to stand up and fight for the men and
women who have contributed so much to our
communities each day in Washington. His-
panic Americans help contribute to what
makes this nation remarkable, and I am hon-
ored to lift up the voices of those who have
selflessly dedicated their lives to building up
themselves, their community, and this country.
Hispanic Americans represent a diversity of
experiences and professions—they are farm-
ers, construction workers, teachers, doctors,
entrepreneurs, elected officials, and service-
members in our armed forces. I am struck by
the common desire among Hispanic Ameri-
cans in my district to give back to their own
communities. Not only have these men and
women earned incredible success for them-
selves, they also demonstrate an impressive
commitment to improving their community and
the entire state of Georgia. Their love of this
district, this state, and this country is worth
recognizing every day, but particularly during
Hispanic Heritage Month. Therefore, I am hon-
ored to highlight three constituents who de-
serve special recognition this month: Gabriel
Vaca, Maria Azuri, and Aixa Pascual.
Gabriel Vaca is the Executive Director of the
Hispanic Business Center. In 2018, Gabriel re-
ceived special recognition at a celebration of
the 50 Most Influential Latinos in Georgia. Just
this year, he was inducted into the inaugural
class of the Georgia Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce Hall of Fame. Gabriel served UPS
International for 24 years as a consultant in lo-
gistics and the global supply chain. During his
time with the Georgia Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce, he has served as Chairman of the
Board, Chairman of the Hispanic Business
Center, and a member of the Senior Executive
Corporate Advisory Board of the U.S. Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C.
Born in Mexico City and raised in Washington,
D.C., Gabriel currently resides in Roswell,
Georgia with his two children.
Maria Azuri is the Director of Candid-South,
an organization that focuses on philanthropic
efforts for immigrant communities across the
southeast. Maria came to this country as an
undocumented immigrant when she was a
child which fuels her passion and commitment.
As an Hispanic American citizen and leader
she engages frequently with her communities
around issues of mental and public health,
criminal justice, immigration, and entrepre-
neurship. Prior to her work at Candid-South,
Maria worked in the Mayor’s Office of immi-
grant Affairs as its first Director of Program-
ming. There, she successfully created numer-
ous programs to strengthen immigrant com-
munities through community engagement.
Maria has taught at Georgia State University’s
School of Social Work and designed a pro-
gram that trains community health providers to
offer health information from culturally and lin-
guistically sensitive perspectives-the first of its
kind in the south. Her work has been recog-
nized by the U.S. Conference of Mayors and
the White House under President Barack
Obama. Maria lives in Atlanta with her three
boys.
Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Aixa
Pascual is a champion for Hispanic commu-
nities in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District.
For the past seven years, she has worked at
the Latin American Association in Atlanta,
where she serves as the managing director of
advocacy, civic outreach, and cultural engage-
ment. Aixa is the child of two Puerto Rican
parents, and she spent her life traveling be-
tween Puerto Rico and the mainland United
States. She is a graduate of Princeton and
Columbia University, and has worked pre-
viously as a journalist for Business Week,
Time and People magazines, the Atlanta Jour-
nal Constitution, and Puerto Rico’s El Nuevo
Dia. Aixa’s childhood in Puerto Rico gave her
a strong sense of her cultural and linguistic
identity which she cherishes to this day. Her
work with the Latin American Association has
allowed her to engage closely with Georgia’s

Latino population, which she says enables her
to understand the struggles of immigrant fami-
lies and their desire to make sacrifices to give
their children better opportunities.
It is my distinct honor and privilege to recog-
nize three of the many Hispanic Americans in
Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District who are
working hard every day to make a difference
in their communities. As we continue to cele-
brate the observation of Hispanic Heritage
Month, may we recommit to the spirit of serv-
ice demonstrated by these individuals and the
many others whose stories have yet to be
told. On behalf of myself, the Sixth Congres-
sional District of Georgia, and the United
States House of Representatives, I am proud
to join in the celebration of Hispanic Heritage
Month. In telling the stories of constituents like
Gabriel, Maria, and Aixa, we celebrate the
power of our Hispanic community in Georgia.
As their representative, I will continue to
champion their values of strength, service, and
patriotism every day.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL
DUMPLING DAY
HON. NYDIA M. VELÁZQUEZ
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor National Dumpling Day. Na-
tional Dumpling Day was inaugurated back in
2015 in Brooklyn, NY and is now celebrated
across America every year on September 26.
Dumplings made their humble beginnings in
Ancient China, almost 1,800 years ago, where
they were known as jiaozi. In America, dump-
lings were introduced in the mid-1800s by Chi-
nese laborers building the transcontinental rail-
road. From Korean mandu and Chinese soup
dumplings, to the Indian samosa and Tibetan
momo, dumplings have become a world deli-
cacy and bear tremendous cultural signifi-
cance in our Asian Pacific American commu-
nities. Today, families come together across
our country to the table to wrap, cook and
enjoy this delightful treasure.
In the 7th Congressional District of New
York, we are proud to have CJ TMI Foods, a
part of CJ America, as one of the country’s
largest dumpling manufacturers and the found-
er of National Dumpling Day. Since 1989, CJ
TMI Foods has been a minority-owned busi-
ness, creating fresh and tasty dumplings and
noodles. The company has grown exponen-
tially over the years by expanding into new fa-
cilities and employing over 400 people. I ad-
mire their trailblazing mission of connecting
and inspiring individuals of all cultural identi-
ties through exposure to Asian food.
Dumplings are more than just delicious
comfort food, they are a bonding experience
among many of our families. I ask my col-
leagues in the 116th Congress to join me in
celebrating National Dumpling Day and recog-
nizing the value these ubiquitous and delicious
pockets of dough carry, unifying neighbors
and sparking joy.
HONORING THE LIFE OF SENATOR
ROBERT GRIFFIN AND RECOG-
NIZING HIS INDUCTION INTO THE
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR’S HALL
OF HONOR
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize the life and service of the
late Senator Robert Griffin on the occasion of
his induction into the Department of Labor’s
Hall of Honor. Through a lifetime of unparal-
leled leadership and devotion to the public
good, Senator Griffin became an indispen-
sable part of the state of Michigan.
Robert Paul Griffin was born November 6,
1923, in Detroit, Michigan. The son of an auto
factory foreman, Griffin spent his youth work-
ing on auto assembly lines. During the Second
World War, Robert enlisted in the 71st Infantry
Division of the U.S. Army, where he served
from 1943 until 1946. Following his military
service, Robert attended Central Michigan
University and went on to earn his law degree
from the University of Michigan in 1950. He
practiced law in Traverse City until his election
to the U.S. House of Representatives as the
Congressman for what was then Michigan’s
Ninth District in 1956.
Representative Griffin became a national
leader in the fight against organized crime and
union corruption, eventually helping to create
the Labor Management Reporting and Disclo-
sure Act of 1959—also known as the
Landrum-Griffin Act. This landmark piece of
Labor legislation has helped to promote de-
mocracy, weed out corruption, and allow
members to participate more freely in the af-
fairs of their union. After serving in the House
for five terms, Griffin was appointed to a va-
cant Senate seat, where he would go on to
win reelection and serve as the Senate Minor-
ity Whip. Following his time in the Senate, he
returned to Traverse City to practice law until
his election to the Michigan Supreme Court in
1986. He served on the Court until his retire-
ment in 1994. He passed away in 2015 at the
age of 91.
In commemoration of the 60th anniversary
of the Landrum-Griffin Act, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor has inducted Senator Griffin
and former National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) member Howard Jenkins, Jr., into the
Department’s Hall of Honor. With his lifetime
of promoting fair and responsible practices in
unions, none are more deserving of this honor
than Senator Griffin. The impact of his life’s
work on the people of the United States can-
not be overstated.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize

CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF INNERCITY STRUGGLE
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate InnerCity Struggle
on its 25th anniversary of movement building
on the Eastside of Los Angeles.
InnerCity Struggle (ICS) was started in 1994
by a group of parents, youth, and residents in
Boyle Heights who joined together to find solu-
tions to a crisis in their community. ICS has
organized young people and families to de-
mand educational justice, an end to the
school-to-prison pipeline, and college access
for all.
A quarter-century later, ICS has built an im-
pressive record of significant policy victories,
including $940 million in public resources for
neighborhood schools. It has empowered
more than 1,200 grassroots leaders who work
together to engage decision makers and hold
them accountable.
In 2004, ICS won its first significant cam-
paign when the Board of Education of the Los
Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)
agreed to build new Eastside schools for the
first time in more than 80 years. The
Eastside’s Roosevelt and Garfield High
Schools were among the most overcrowded
schools in the nation. LAUSD ultimately
opened three new high schools and a new el-
ementary school on the Eastside between
2009 and 2012. And in 2018, after years of
ICS demands, the school board agreed to in-
vest $173 million in modernizing the under-
resourced and neglected Roosevelt High
School campus. By 2022, the district will have
transformed the school into a state-of-the-art
center anchored in college and career prepa-
ration.
ICS parents and students have also taken
the stance that all students should be eligible
to apply to college. In 2005, ICS was part of
a citywide coalition that helped secure the
‘‘A–G Life Prep’’ policy, which mandated that
LAUSD align its graduation requirements with
California public university eligibility. That year,
only 44 percent of LAUSD graduates from
Eastside high schools had A–G college course
requirements. By 2016, a historic 80 percent
of Eastside graduates had A–G requirements.
ICS also recognizes the power of voting to
shape our communities. That is why the orga-
nization has invested in engaging and mobi-
lizing voters on the Eastside. In all, ICS has
engaged over 51,000 voters, and registered
4,000 new ones.
ICS helped form the Brothers, Sons, Selves
Coalition in 2013. This county-wide coalition
was formed to end the criminalization of young
boys and men of color by creating and influ-
encing public policy that invests in young peo-
ple. One of the coalition’s key victories was a
demand for ending the use of ‘‘willful defi-
ance’’ as grounds for school suspension. The
‘‘willful defiance’’ category had a long record
of disproportionately targeting African Amer-
ican and Latinx students, particularly males.
The LAUSD Board voted to ban ‘‘willful defi-
ance’’ suspensions in favor of restorative jus-
tice interventions, making it the first district in
the nation to do so.
In 2014, ICS secured $50 million for the
construction of comprehensive school-based

wellness centers in high-need schools, so
these schools could play a more important
role in providing wrap-around supports for
communities. That same year, ICS joined
forces with the Advancement Project and
Community Coalition on a successful cam-
paign which led to LAUSD’s adoption of a res-
olution to equitably distribute new state fund-
ing, called the Local Control Funding Formula,
to the highest-need schools. The campaign ar-
gued that areas in the Eastside and South LA
deserved an equitable distribution of funding,
based on decades of disinvestment that had
led to higher concentrations of poverty and
trauma in these areas.
Earlier this year, ICS moved into a bright
new era when it opened the InnerCity Struggle
Youth and Community Center. This permanent
headquarters will serve as the political hub for
the Eastside and inspire a new generation of
leaders to transform their neighborhoods. The
center will be a place where young people can
find their voice, and parents can advance
change.
On October 3, 2019, InnerCity Struggle will
commemorate its 25th anniversary, and I will
be joining more than four hundred supporters
who are expected to attend their celebration.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
please join me in celebrating InnerCity Strug-
gle for being a leading voice for progress on
the Eastside of Los Angeles and reaching this
historic milestone.

FLORIDA 16TH DISTRICT CONGRES-
SIONAL FIRE AND RESCUE AND
EMS AWARDS
HON. VERN BUCHANAN
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Fire and Rescue and EMS
personnel who have provided distinguished
service to the people of Florida’s 16th Con-
gressional District.
As first responders, fire departments and
emergency medical service teams are sum-
moned on short notice to serve their respec-
tive communities. Often times, they arrive at
scenes of great adversity and trauma, to
which they reliably bring strength and
composure. These brave men and women
spend hundreds of hours in training so that
they are prepared when they get ‘‘the call.’’
In 2012, I established the 16th District Con-
gressional Fire and Rescue and EMS Awards
to honor officers, departments and units for
outstanding achievement.
On behalf of the people of Florida’s 16th
District, it is my privilege to congratulate the
following winners, who were selected this year
by an independent committee comprised of a
cross section of current and retired Fire and
Rescue personnel living in the district:
Lt. Ryan Anusbigian of the Hillsborough
County Fire Rescue and Captain Thomas
‘‘Mike’’ Bloski of the Southern Manatee Fire
Rescue District were chosen to receive the
Dedication and Professionalism Award.
Deputy Tyler Ackerman, Deputy Timothy
Collins and Deputy Brian Hart of the Manatee
County Sheriff’s Office were chosen to receive
the Preservation of Life Associate Service
Award.
Donald O’Leary, Retired Commissioner of
the East Manatee Fire Rescue District and the
New York City Fire Department was chosen to
receive the Career Service Award.
Manatee County EMS Ambulance Strike
Team 601 was chosen to receive the Unit Ci-
tation Award. This unit is comprised of the fol-
lowing personnel: District Chief Mark Regis,
Charge Paramedic Richard Johnson, Charge

IN RECOGNITION OF LAWRENCE
FALIVENA
HON. GEORGE HOLDING
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Lawrence ‘‘Larry’’ Falivena from
Apex, NC. Two years ago, Larry was diag-
nosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
(ALS). Following this news, Larry has fiercely
dedicated his time to his family and the ALS
community. After speaking with the CEO of
the ALS Association about how he could make
a positive and lasting impact for those im-
pacted by the disease, Larry created the ‘‘Iron
Horse Tour’’. On the tour, Larry, his wife
Shana, and his two sons, set out to visit all 30
Major League Baseball parks during one
baseball season in order to spread national
awareness and raise funding for research to
combat ALS.
On September 8th, Larry attended his thir-
tieth and final game at SunTrust Park in At-
lanta, GA. At each stop along the way, Larry
met and spoke with several incredible people
who were also courageously battling the dis-
ease. He shares their stories to spread aware-
ness and encourage others to assist in the
fight against ALS. Larry has successfully
raised over $29,000 for ALS research thus far
and has gained wide-spread attention across
the nation. Larry’s commitment to helping
combat the disease and educating others is
an inspiration to us all.
Larry represents the best of our nation. He
is a true role model and I am very proud to
recognize his efforts and accomplishments.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
Larry Falivena.

HONORING ARBOR HOUSING AND
DEVELOPMENT FOR ITS FIF-
TIETH ANNIVERSARY
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
recognize Arbor Housing and Development for
the fiftieth Anniversary of its founding.
In 1969, Arbor Housing and Development
was founded as Steuben Churchpeople
Against Poverty. The organization began as a
volunteer driven service offering poverty relief
services. At that time, the organization had
eight part-time volunteers focusing on self-help
housing.
Arbor Housing and Development has grown
over the years and has fully embraced a mis-
sion of enhancing the quality of life within its
community by building independence and cre-
ating housing options. Growing from the small,
volunteer-based service to an organization
that has one hundred and twenty full-time em-
ployees, it is evident Arbor Housing and De-
velopment is deserving of recognition.
Arbor Housing and Development President
Jeffrey Eaton has been with the organization
since 2000, and has been greatly involved in
its success. Under his leadership, the organi-
zation has been involved in the Neighborworks
program; development of the Gerard Block
Apartments; the development of the former
Northside Blodgett site; and many others.
Arbor Housing and Development serves
many people over the span of seven counties
in New York State and has also expanded to
Northern Pennsylvania, The organization of-
fers residential behavioral health and domestic
violence services to help people live safety on
their own, owns nine hundred units of afford-
able housing in three states and also provides
assistance for renters and home-buyers to
create a pathway to security and stability for
housing.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
recognize Arbor Housing and Development on
their fiftieth Anniversary.

CONGRATULATING CHIEF JERRY
DYER ON HIS RETIREMENT
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Chief Jerry Dyer on the occasion of
his retirement from the Fresno Police Depart-
ment after 40 years of service. Chief Dyer has
dedicated his career to protecting the people
of the Central Valley making our community a
safer place.
Jerry Dyer was born and raised in Fresno,
California and attended California State Uni-
versity, Fresno; receiving his bachelor’s de-
gree in Criminology. He later received his
master’s degree in Management from Cali-
fornia Polytechnic University, Pomona and
graduated from the California Command Col-
lege for law enforcement leaders. He joined
the Fresno Police Department in May of 1979.
Chief Dyer quickly rose within the ranks of
the department. He served as a Police Spe-
cialist and SWAT team member, Patrol Ser-
geant for Southwest District and SWAT team
supervisor. Other leadership roles included;
Sergeant for the Patrol Narcotics Enforcement,
Police Lieutenant in Central District, Captain of
Southeast District and Skywatch Commander.
In 1999, he was named Assistant Chief of Po-
lice before being named Chief of Police in
2001.
Chief Dyer and the Fresno Police Depart-
ment have received a number of accolades
during his tenure. In 2005, he was awarded
the Excellence in Public Service Award that is
sponsored by The Fresno Bee, The Fresno
Business Council, and the Maddy Institute at
the California State University, Fresno. His de-
partment became nationally accredited
through the Commission on Accreditation for
Law Enforcement Agencies. In 2008, Chief
Dyer served as the president of the California
Police Chief’s Association. In 2011, at the
California Police Chief’s Conference, he was
awarded the Joseph T. Molloy Award, for his
commitment to mission of the organization. He
was also named the 2nd Vice President of
Major Cities Chief’s Association, which rep-
resents large municipal departments through-
out the country.
Chief Dyer built strong relationships with the
community and citizens of Fresno to promote
trust in police officers. He implemented re-
forms that were proposed by the Obama Ad-
ministration’s Task Force on 21st Century Po-
licing and embraced the latest in policing tech-
nology to ensure his officers could properly
and safely perform their duties.
Chief Dyer was active in the community
throughout his career. He served on the
boards of the Marjaree Mason Center and
Breaking the Chains, worked with his church,
spoke at community events, and participated
in charity events. Through his career he has
had the steadfast support of his wife Diane
and their two children and grandchildren.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating him on his impressive
law enforcement career. His contributions to
the Central Valley over the past 40 years will
be felt for many years to come. I wish he and
his family continued health, happiness and
prosperity in this new chapter.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF MINNESOTA COMMU-
NITY CARE
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Minnesota Community Care’s 50th
anniversary. With 18 locations in Saint Paul
that serve more than 37,000 patients each
year, Minnesota Community Care is the larg-
est federally qualified community health center
in Minnesota and a leader in innovative, com-
passionate, community-based care for patients
where they live, work and go to school.
Since 1969, Minnesota Community Care
has been serving the health care needs of its
patients across Saint Paul in a culturally ap-
propriate way. In 1972, the nonprofit organiza-
tion was incorporated as West Side Health
Center, delivering care to 1900 patients from
a clinic in the Neighborhood House community
center in the heart of the neighborhood.
A foundational part of Minnesota Community
Care’s mission is providing care to our most
vulnerable populations, including young peo-
ple, homeless and uninsured families, and oth-
ers in need. Its Health Care for the Homeless
program began in 1987. In 1992, in collabora-
tion with Ramsey County, it started its
HouseCalls homeless prevention program. A
year later, working with the St. Paul Public
Housing Agency, it established McDonough
Homes Clinic—a primary care clinic for public
housing residents in the North End neighbor-
hood.
Minnesota Community Care is a leader in
providing affordable dental care, under-
standing its impact on overall health. In 1978,
it started providing dental services and in
2001, West Side Dental Clinic was estab-
lished. In 2013, with the help from a major Af-
fordable Care Act grant, it expanded its dental
care to reach more patients when it opened its
new East Side Family Clinic.
As communities across our state have
worked to improve educational achievement,
Minnesota Community Care is working to keep
students healthy and in school learning by car-
ing for student patients where they are.
Through its 10 school-based clinics, youth can
access critical medical, mental health, and nu-
trition services and learn to be advocates for
their health. These school-based clinics are a
model for improving health and education out-
comes at the same time.
Madam Speaker, it was a pleasure to host
you during your visit to Saint Paul in May as
we met with leaders from Minnesota Commu-
nity Care and other community health centers.
Working to strengthen our community health
centers is one of the most effective ways to in-
crease access to affordable health care across
our community. Please join me in honoring the
50th anniversary of Minnesota Community
Care’s dedication to providing quality and af-
fordable health care for all.

COUNCIL
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 120th Anniversary of
the Northeastern Pennsylvania Building and
Construction Trades Council. The Trades
Council was originally formed as a sub-
committee of the Greater Wilkes-Barre Labor
Council in 1899, following the rapid growth of
unionization of workers in the area. The mile-
stone will be celebrated along with the 125th
anniversary of the Greater Wilkes-Barre Labor
Council at a special event on Saturday, Sep-
tember 28, 2019.
In 1899, five years after its formation, the
Wilkes-Barre Central Labor Council was thriv-
ing. Three hundred delegates representing
118 local unions were attending meetings reg-
ularly to discuss important issues such as se-
curing higher wages and better working condi-
tions for laborers in the Wyoming Valley.
Leaders John Casey (a pro-labor Representa-
tive who served seven terms representing
Northeastern Pennsylvania in the U.S. House)
and John Mullery saw the need for additional
structure within the Labor Council and created
the Building Trades Council as a sub-
committee.
Throughout its 120-year history, the Trades
Council has worked tirelessly to advocate for
the rights and interests of workers throughout
Northeastern Pennsylvania. The organization
has not only benefited workers but has also
given support to many community causes,
projects, and programs that serve everyone in
our community.
It is an honor to recognize the important
work done by the Northeastern Pennsylvania
Building and Construction Trades Council.
These trades have always been vital to our re-
gion’s economy and will continue to be so in

IN HONOR OF GARY GRUNAU
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise to ex-
press my deepest condolences on the passing
of Gary Grunau a Milwaukee real estate de-
veloper and civic leader. Gary was born on
April 17, 1939, in Bay View, Wisconsin, and
lived his entire life in Milwaukee. He was a
loving husband, father, uncle, grandfather,
brother, relative, and friend to many here in
Milwaukee.
Gary left his home to attend Cornell Univer-
sity, but knew that Milwaukee was where he
belonged. Upon earning his degree in me-
chanical engineering, he returned home to join
Grunau Co. Inc, a business started by his
grandfather. In the late 70’s, the company was
working on the Hyatt Regency construction
project in downtown Milwaukee, but Gary had
to step in as the developer to complete the
project. He was the developer on several
major projects in the city including the Wis-
consin Center, Discovery World at Pier Wis-
consin, Manpower Group World Headquarters,
the Milwaukee Riverwalk System, and the
former Time Warner Building. However, he is
best known for revitalizing the former Joseph
Schlitz Brewing Co. complex into one of Mil-
waukee’s most desirable working environ-
ments, the Schlitz Park office complex. Gary’s
projects won numerous awards including the
Urban Land Institute (ULI) Achievement
Award, The National Council for Urban Eco-
nomic Development Award and the ULI’s
2017–2018 Global Award of Excellence for the
Milwaukee Riverwalk, considered among the
world’s highest honors from land use experts.
He also led and served on many boards, in-
cluding the Milwaukee Academy of Science,
Discovery World, Alverno College Board of
Trustees, Milwaukee Riverwalk District, Spirit
of Milwaukee, and the Greater Milwaukee
Committee.
Gary wanted to make Milwaukee a better
place for all its residents. He was committed
to addressing the racial and economic dispari-
ties that have plagued our city. He was dis-
turbed by our city’s status as one of the most
segregated communities in the country and
knew that the lack of affordable housing and
support for public schools, prevented the up-
ward mobility for people living in our poorest
zip codes. In an article two years ago, Gary
said that ‘‘Segregation hurts the city’s eco-
nomic competitiveness, but not enough is
being doing about it . . . the lack of inclusion
hurts us downtown. It hurts us in education. It
hurts us nationally.’’ He took those words to
his heart and didn’t simply talk the talk, he
walked it; raising millions of dollars to improve
education and economic opportunities for the
city.
Gary leaves to cherish his memory his wife
Joanne; sons Paul (Jeanie) Grunau, Daniel
Grunau, and John (Adrienne) Grunau; stepson
Jeff (Kate) MacInnes and stepdaughter Laura
MacInnes; grandchildren Grace, Hank, Gus,
Sadie, Alex, Jon, Grant, Andrew, Wesley,
Darcy, and Wilson Grunau, and many other
relatives and friends.
Gary was my friend and while our fights
against injustice didn’t always go our way, he
stayed committed to find a way to solve prob-
lems. Even with his illness, he continued for-
ward, focusing on his final project; revitalizing
Milwaukee both economically and in terms of
racial equity.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons I rise to
salute Gary Grunau, a man that has positively
impacted the 4th Congressional District, the
State of Wisconsin, and the world.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE GRAND TRAVERSE
COUNTY SENIOR CENTER NET-
WORK
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the
Grand Traverse County Senior Center Net-
work. Through its dedicated service and
steadfast devotion to its community, the Sen-
ior Center has become an indispensable part
of Michigan’s First District.
In 1964, community leaders Vince and Lou
Ecarius launched the Adult Activity Club, a
local group that met in the basement of Mun-
son Medical Center. In 1969, the club moved
to its current location in Traverse City. Fol-
lowing Vince and Lou’s retirement in 1978, the
City of Traverse City took up responsibility for
the club and organized it as a part of the local
government. Thanks to the support of the local
community and the tireless efforts of their staff
and volunteers, the Senior Center grew into
the local institution it is today. Now adminis-
tered by Grand Traverse County, the Senior
Center Network works to provide social,
wellness, and educational programs in a fun
and inclusive environment for those in the
community over 50. In addition to the Traverse
City location, the Senior Center Network now
includes satellite programming in Interlochen,
Kingsley, Acme, and Fife Lake. From dances
and social clubs to computer labs and exer-
cise programs, the impact of the center’s work
on the people of Grand Traverse County can-
not be overstated. Day after day, the Grand
Traverse Senior Center Network shows what
can be achieved when the people of a com-
munity work together for the common good.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize
the Grand Traverse County Senior Center
Network for fifty years of success and service
to Northern Michigan. Michiganders can take
great pride in knowing the First District is
home to such dedicated citizens. On behalf of
my constituents, I wish them all the best in
their future endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF CHIEF DAVID HUERTA
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and pay tribute to the life of Fresno
State Police Chief David Huerta. Chief Huerta
passed away August 16 at the age of 68.
David was born on May 10, 1951 and was
a lifelong resident of Fresno County. He re-
ceived his bachelor’s degree in Organizational
Behavior from the University of San Francisco
in 1989 and his master’s degree in Crimi-
nology from California State University, Fresno
(Fresno State) in 1992, graduating with dis-
tinction.
David’s career was dedicated to serving and
protecting the people of the Central Valley. He
served the Department with the Fresno Coun-
ty Sheriff’s office for 30 years, he retired with
the rank of lieutenant. His career did not stop
at his retirement. David was named chief of
police and director of public safety of the Fres-
no State Police Department in 2004.
At Fresno State, he oversaw 27 officers and
over 30 non-sworn full-time staff. Along with
many other responsibilities, his department
also oversaw the emergency preparedness
and business continuity at Fresno State. Be-
cause of his diligence, the Fresno State Police
Department became an International Associa-
tion of Campus Law Enforcement Administra-
tors (IACLEA) accredited department in June
2019.
In addition to his responsibilities as police
chief, David taught criminology classes as ad-
junct faculty at National University and at the
Clovis Unified School District’s Regional Occu-
pation Program. He was also a member of the
advisory panel of the Public Safety Pathway
program at the Reagan Educational Center in
Clovis.
David received many accolades during his
career. He was awarded a distinguished serv-
ice medal in SWAT for 22-plus years of work
and was named officer of the year by the
American Legion, in addition to many honors
with the Sheriffs Department.
David is survived by his wife, Cynthia, and
their four children, Breanne, Austin, Brandt,
Carragan, son-in-law Steve, daughter-in-law
Liz and 3 grandchildren, Micaela, Allison, and
Brixton. David is also survived by his father

RECOGNIZING TAIWAN’S NATIONAL
DAY
HON. DON BACON
OF NEBRASKA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to wish both the people of Taiwan and Ameri-
cans celebrating the upcoming Taiwan’s Na-
tional Day on October 10th a Happy Double
Ten Day.
In the decades preceding and following the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United
States and Taiwan have built a solid bond that
cannot be broken—born out of our shared val-
ues and our cooperation with each other in
times of crisis, and in times of advancement.
During the years, this key ally in the Indo-
Pacific has transformed itself into a model of
democracy that respects human rights, free-
dom of speech, rule of law, and market econ-
omy. Americans share these values, which is
why we have also contributed to Taiwan’s suc-
cess.
In 2018, Taiwan was the 11th largest trad-
ing partner for the United States overall, and
it is my home state Nebraska’s 10th largest
export market in the world. Our companies
have substantial opportunities to expand their
business and cooperation with Taiwan. I will,
together with Taiwanese friends, work to find
areas where we can partner to our mutual
benefit.
This is a day to celebrate, and to be opti-
mistic. I ask my colleagues to join me in re-
committing ourselves to the robust U.S.-Tai-
wan relationship, and in wishing Taiwan a
Happy Double Ten Day.

RECOGNIZING TIM CHAMBERS FOR
HIS UNWAVERING DEDICATION
TO THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA
HON. TROY BALDERSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, September 26, 2019
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and honor the unwavering
dedication of retired Marine Staff Sergeant,
Tim Chambers.
First spotted in 2002, Tim Chambers—better
known as ‘‘The Saluting Marine’’—stood at at-
tention for hours as thousands of motorcyclists
rode past during the Rolling Thunder ‘‘Ride for
Freedom’’ event in Washington, D.C. Since
then, Tim has not missed a Rolling Thunder
event. His single salute in 2002 set an exam-
ple that has since rippled throughout the na-
tion, raising awareness for missing-in-action
servicemembers and prisoners of war.
Year after year, Tim continues to give vet-
erans the welcome home they deserve yet did
not receive upon returning home from war.
Standing for hours on end in, Tim overcomes
physical conditions that would otherwise
render him immobile, purely to honor the men
and women who made the ultimate sacrifice
for our country.
A modern-day hero, Tim selflessly rushed
into the Pentagon after the crash of American
Airlines Flight 77 during the 9/11 terrorist at-
tacks, without knowing what lay ahead for him,
the victims, and our country. Tim stayed three
days in the attacks’ aftermath to continue res-
cue operations of his fellow Americans. Even
in the most harrowing of times, Tim’s love of
and dedication to country, along with his pro-
found bravery, has always overcome the most
colossal challenges.
A former Marine, Tim now acts as a vet-
erans’ rights advocate, ensuring that the men
and women who serve our country receive the
respect, honor, remembrance, and thanks they
deserve.
As I attend the Rolling Thunder event this
coming weekend in Columbus, I will think of
Tim’s honorable dedication to his country and
fellow veterans, and all the American
servicemembers who may never get their due
welcome home. Tim Chamber’s devotion to
our Armed Forces is felt throughout our na-
tion, and I am humbled to honor him, returning
to him the recognition and glory he has shown
for his fellow American heroes.

DEAR CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS: We are a
bipartisan group of state and territorial at-
torneys general who recognize that the
states, territories and federal government
share a strong interest in protecting public
safety and bringing grey market financial
activities into the regulated banking sector.
To address these goals, we urge Congress to
advance legislation that would allow states
and territories that have legalized certain
use of marijuana to bring that commerce
into the banking system.
This issue is of broad relevance: for exam-
ple, thirty-three states and several U.S. ter-
ritories have legalized the medical use of
marijuana. However, because the federal
government classifies marijuana as an ille-
gal substance, banks providing services to
state-licensed cannabis businesses and even
to other companies which sell services and
products to those businesses could find
themselves subject to criminal and civil li-
ability under the federal Controlled Sub-
stances Act and certain federal banking stat-
utes. This risk has significantly inhibited
the ability of financial institutions to pro-
vide services to these businesses and compa-
nies.
Despite the contradictions between federal
and state law, the marijuana industry con-
tinues to grow rapidly. Industry analysts es-
timate 2017 sales at $8.3 billion and expect
those totals to exceed $25 billion by 2025. Yet
those revenues are handled outside of the
regulated banking system. Businesses are
forced to operate on a cash basis. The result-
ing grey market makes it more difficult to
track revenues for taxation and regulatory
compliance purposes, contributes to a public
safety threat as cash-intensive businesses
are often targets for criminal activity, and
prevents proper tracking of billions in fi-
nances across the nation. Importantly, this
measure in no way constitutes an endorse-
ment of any state or territory’s specific ap-
proach to the legalization of marijuana-re-
lated transactions, and the Act is in no way
an endorsement for the legalization of med-
ical or retail marijuana in those jurisdic-
tions that choose not to pursue such an ap-
proach. But regardless of how individual pol-
icymakers feel about states permitting the
use of medical or recreational marijuana,
the reality of the situation requires federal
rules that permit a sensible banking regime
for legal businesses.
To address these challenges, we request
that Congress advance the SAFE Banking
Act or similar legislation that would provide
a safe harbor for depository institutions that
provide a financial product or service to a
covered business in a state that has imple-
mented laws and regulations that ensure ac-
countability in the marijuana industry. An
effective safe harbor would bring billions of
dollars into the banking sector, enabling law
enforcement; federal, state and local tax
agencies; and cannabis regulators in 33
states and several territories to more effec-
tively monitor cannabis businesses and their
transactions. Compliance with tax laws and
requirements would be simpler and easier to
enforce with the regulated tracking of funds
in the banking system, resulting in higher
tax revenues.
Our banking system must be flexible
enough to address the needs of businesses in
the various states and territories, with state
and territorial input, while protecting the
interests of the federal government. This in-
cludes a banking system for marijuana-re-
lated businesses that is both responsive and
effective in meeting the demands of our
economy. We look forward to working with

On behalf of the 1.3 million members of the
United Food and Commercial Workers Inter-
national Union (UFCW), including thousands
of cannabis workers, we urge you to vote
‘‘yes’’ on the Secure and Fair Enforcement
Banking Act of 2019 when it comes to the
House floor.
UFCW’s cannabis members can be found in
growing and cultivating facilities; manufac-
turing and processing facilities; and in lab-
oratories and dispensaries in multiple states.
The current ban on banking access for can-
nabis related businesses has led to confusion
and uncertainty for cannabis workers who
are just trying to do their jobs and support
their families. The lack of uniform treat-
ment of cannabis by federal, state and local
laws has resulted in workers being denied
personal loans for homes and cars, even when
they have high credit scores. Hardworking
Americans in the cannabis industry should
not have to struggle with financial and legal
ambiguity while on the job.
Since cannabis employers must pay their
workers in cash, they are also vulnerable to
violent crime both inside and outside their
place of business. When employers gain ac-
cess to conventional banking, their workers
gain both economic and personal security.
A majority of states have some form of
legal cannabis and it is imperative that the
federal government update our nation’s
banking laws to include this new and grow-
ing industry.
As the nation’s largest union of cannabis
workers, we urge Congress to pass the SAFE
Banking Act and give cannabis workers ac-
cess to the same financial systems that all
other American workers enjoy.

President, Director,

AMERICAN BANKERS ASSOCIATION,
September 24, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: The American Bankers Asso-
ciation (ABA) is pleased to express our sup-
port for H.R. 1595, the Secure and Fair En-
forcement Banking Act (SAFE Banking Act)
of 2019, which is scheduled for consideration
before the House of Representatives in the
coming days.
Currently, 33 states covering 68 percent of
the nation’s population have legalized can-
nabis for medical or adult-use and at least
seven additional states are expected to con-
sider ballot initiatives in the next two years.
Despite that, current federal law prevents fi-
nancial institutions from .banking cannabis
businesses, as well as the ancillary busi-
nesses that provide them with goods and
services. As a result, a majority of states are
struggling to address the significant chal-
lenges to public safety, as well as regulatory
compliance and tax compliance that go
hand-in-hand with cash-reliant businesses.
Although we do not take a position on the
legalization of marijuana, our members are
committed to serving the financial needs of
their communities—including those that
have voted to legalize cannabis.
H.R. 1595, sponsored by Representatives ED
PERLMUTTER (D-CO), DENNY HECK (D-WA),
STEVE STIVERS (R-OH) and WARREN DAVID-
SON (R-OH), along with over 200 members of
the House, takes an important step toward
enabling financial services for cannabis-re-
lated businesses.
The bill specifies that proceeds from a le-
gitimate cannabis business would not be con-
sidered unlawful under federal money laun-
dering statutes or any other federal law,
which is necessary to allow financial serv-
ices to cannabis businesses and any ancillary
businesses that derive some portion of their
income from cannabis businesses. The bill
would also direct the Financial Crimes En-
forcement Network (FinCEN) and the federal
banking regulators, through the Federal Fi-
nancial Institutions Examination Council, to
issue guidance and exam procedures for
banks doing business with cannabis related
legitimate businesses. We believe such ex-
plicit, consistent direction from federal fi-
nancial regulators will provide needed clar-
ity for banks and help them to better evalu-
ate the risks and supervisory expectations
for cannabis-related customers.
As the legal state-cannabis industry con-
tinues to grow, the indirect connections to
cannabis revenues—from real estate owners,
security firms, utilities, law firms and em-
ployees of cannabis businesses, as well as in-
vestors—will also continue to expand. With-
out greater clarity, that entire portion of
economic activity in legal cannabis states—
estimated by some to be in the tens of bil-
lions of dollars—will continue to be
marginalizes from the banking system.
Providing a mechanism for the cannabis
industry to access the banking system would
help those communities reduce cash-moti-
vated crimes, increase the efficiency of tax
collections, and improvethe financial trans-
parency of the cannabis industry. It would
also subject cannabis businesses to increased
oversight of their financial activities since
bank accounts are monitored in accordance
with existing anti-money laundering and
Bank Secrecy Act requirements which help
law enforcement identify suspicious trans-
actions—an opportunity that is not available
in an all-cash environment.
The SAFE Banking Act, as amended, is an
important measure that helps clarify many
issues for the banking industry, regulators,
businesses and consumers. It also provides
immediate relief for urgent public safety and
cannabis industry oversight challenges,
which will help keep our communities safe
and should not be delayed while Congress
works to build consensus on broader ques-
tions of national drug policy. ABA urges
members of the House to support H.R. 1595.
Sincerely,
ROB NICHOLS,
President and CEO.

Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the undersigned
state bankers associations, representing
banks throughout the country, we write to
express our support for H.R. 1595, the Secure
and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act
of 2019, which will soon be considered before
the House of Representatives.
Since 1996, 33 states comprising 68 percent
of the nation’s population have legalized
cannabis for medical or adult use, and that
number is only expected to grow. Despite
this ever-growing voter preference, current
Federal law continues to prevent banks from
offering products and services to these busi-
nesses without fear of federal sanctions. In-
evitably, leaving the cannabis industry
unbanked presents serious public safety, rev-
enue administration, and legal compliance
concerns and must be remedied immediately.
As a result of the federal prohibition and
lack of regulatory clarity, legal cannabis
businesses must operate on an all-cash basis,
subjecting their employees and the general
public to serious risk of criminal activity
and harm. These businesses also must remit
payments for state taxes and licensing fees
in cash, denying the states the efficiencies
and safety of more modern payment meth-
ods. This in turn significantly increases
state compliance auditing costs, since oper-
ating on an all-cash basis leaves no paper
trails for auditors to follow.
The impact on local economies is also sig-
nificant. As the cannabis industry continues
to grow in states where it is legal, unrelated
businesses that provide products and services
to the industry also become ensnared in the
problem. Because revenue paid to them by
cannabis businesses can be considered mon-
ies derived from illegal activities, and finan-
cial institutions that bank the unrelated
businesses can be accused of violating anti-
money laundering laws. If banks are forced
to discontinue relationships with these unre-
lated businesses, a significant portion of the
economy in states where cannabis is legal
will be cut off from the regulated banking
system.
Although we do not take a position on the
legalization of marijuana, our members are
committed to serving the financial needs of
their communities—including those that
have voted to legalize cannabis. That is why
we support H.R. 1595. This is fair and bal-
anced legislation that will permit depository
institutions to serve the needs of their cus-
tomers in states where cannabis is legal. The
bill provides a mechanism for the cannabis
industry and its service providers to deposit
their cash in regulated financial institu-
tions, which allows banks to meet the needs

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of our members, we
write to express our support for H.R. 1595,
the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE)
Banking Act of 2019 which is scheduled for
consideration before the House of Represent-
atives in the near future.
This important bipartisan legislation, in-
troduced by Representatives Ed Perlmutter
(D-CO), Steve Stivers (R-OH), Denny Heck
(D-WA) and Warren Davidson (R-OH) and
supported by over 200 cosponsors would per-
mit depository institutions to serve the
needs of their customers in states where can-
nabis is legal.
The House Financial Services Committee
has held substantive hearings on H.R. 1595
and worked cooperatively to solve the prac-
tical problems caused by the disparate treat-
ment of cannabis under federal and state
laws. Although we do not take a position on
the legalization of marijuana, our members
are committed to serving the financial needs
of their communities—including those that
have voted to legalize cannabis. The current
threat of criminal and civil liability under
federal law is suppressing the provision of
vital financial services in the thirty-three
states that have legalized cannabis in some
form.
The SAFE Banking Act of 2019 provides a
mechanism for the cannabis industry and its
service providers to deposit their cash in reg-
ulated financial institutions, which allows
our members to meet the needs of their com-
munities and helps those communities re-
duce cash-motivated crimes, increase the ef-
ficiency of tax collections, and improve the
financial transparency of the cannabis indus-
try.
Without congressional action, a significant
portion of economic activity, including those
businesses with only indirect connections to
the cannabis industry, such as vendors, sup-
pliers, and utility companies, risk being
marginalized from the financial system in
states with legal cannabis industries. H.R.
1595 provides needed legal protection and
clarity for financial institutions to accept
deposits, extend credit, and provide other fi-
nancial services to individuals and busi-
nesses that derive some portion of their in-
come from legal state cannabis related activ-
ity.
We urge members of the House to support
H.R. 1595.

SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER HOYER,
MAJORITY WHIP CLYBURN, MINORITY LEADER
MCCARTHY, AND MINORITY WHIP SCALISE: The
Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America (MBCA)
is writing to urge House consideration of Se-
cure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking
Act of 2019, which would allow the provision
of banking services to cannabis-related busi-
nesses (CRBs) through a federal safe harbor.
We deeply appreciate the House Financial
Services Committee’s bipartisan passage of
the bill in March, and look forward to the
full House passing it as well.
The conflict between federal and states
laws and the evolving legal and regulatory
environment surrounding cannabis has put
banks and CRBs in an untenable position.
While the public policy question of whether
cannabis should be legalized is outside the
scope of the MBCA charter, it is greatly con-
cerning that our member banks could find
themselves the subject of regulatory enforce-
ment actions as a result of extending serv-
ices to legally licensed businesses directly
involved in cannabis commerce, or even busi-
nesses that provide services to those can-
nabis businesses.
While a variety of attempts have been
made to restrict federal enforcement of can-
nabis laws, including the Cole Memorandum
and the Leahy and Joyce-Blumenauer
amendments, the Director of the Financial
Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has
stated unequivocally that it is a federal
crime to sell, manufacture or purchase mari-
juana (the terms used in the Controlled Sub-
stances Act of 1970). It is therefore prohib-
ited under federal law to provide banking
services to CRBs, which includes a wide
range of ancillary businesses that have no di-
rect involvement in the sale, manufacture or
purchase of marijuana. Even if banks at-
tempt to avoid banking businesses that are
involved directly in the cannabis industry,
questions arise regarding businesses that
may service those cannabis establishments.
Is a payroll processor that provides services
to a dispensary violating federal law, and
therefore ineligible for banking services? Is a
real estate developer who might have one
property occupied by a dispensary or grower
likewise in violation? Unfortunately, our
member banks simply do not know what is
allowed and what we are not allowed to do.
These questions assume enormous impor-
tance due to the massive negative impact on
banks resulting from potential Bank Secrecy
Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML)
violations. We fear, however, that due to the
complicated legal and regulatory environ-
ment, violations could occur that result in
significant reputational, economic and legal
damage despite our bankers’ best efforts to
avoid violating federal laws and regulations.
As of today, thirty-three states and the
District of Columbia have legalized cannabis
for medical and/or adult use, and, as such,
this is now a national issue that requires a
federal solution. It is clear that only Con-
gress can take effective action to resolve
these issues, and while the SAFE Banking
Act is not a perfect solution to the problem
of a federal-state conflict in this area, the
MBCA supports the SAFE Banking Act as an
important step forward, and we urge the
House to consider it.
The Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America
appreciates your attention to this critical
matter. If you have any questions about this
letter or any additional information would
be helpful, please contact Brent Tjarks, the
MBCA’s Executive Director.
